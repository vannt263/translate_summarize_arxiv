    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most promising theoretical frameworks for a successful unification of gravity with all other fundamental forces and is the most appealing perturbative solution to the gauge hierarchy problem of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "however , susy is not an exact symmetry of nature .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) @xcite , the minimal susy realization , must break susy softly in order to accomplish agreement with experimental observations and its breaking scale should not be much larger than a few tev in order to retain naturalness . in general , the susy breakdown introduces a large number of unknown parameters , many of which can be complex @xcite .",
    "cp  violating phases associated with sfermions of the first and , to a lesser extent , second generations are severely constrained by bounds on the electric dipole moments of the electron , neutron and muon .",
    "the present experimental upper bounds on the neutron edm @xmath6 and electron edm @xmath7 are very tight @xcite : @xmath8 and @xmath9 at the 2@xmath10 level . as a result of the cp crises ,",
    "some fine  tuning mechanisms are necessary in generic supersymmetric theories to avoid these problems .",
    "there have been several phenomenologically attractive solutions @xcite to evade these constraints without suppressing the cp  violating phases .",
    "one option is to make the first two generations of scalar fermions rather heavy so that one  loop edm constraints are automatically evaded . as a matter of fact one",
    "can consider so  called effective susy models @xcite which seem to combine all healthy features of both the mssm and technicolor theories .",
    "the main virtue of the effective susy model is that any non ",
    "sm source of cp violation and fcnc involving the first two generations is suppressed by allowing their respective soft  susy  breaking masses to be as high as 20 tev , whereas third generation scalar quarks and leptons may naturally be light well below the tev scale .",
    "another possibility is to arrange for partial cancellations among various contributions to the electron and neutron edm s @xcite .",
    "following the suggestions that the cp  violating phases do not have to be always suppressed , many important works on the effects due to the cp  violating phases in the mssm have been already reported ; the effects are very significant in extracting the parameters in the susy lagrangian from experimental data @xcite , estimating dark matter densities and scattering cross sections and higgs boson mass limits @xcite , cp violation in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 systems @xcite , and so on .",
    "in particular , it has been found @xcite that the higgs  sector cp violation induced via loop corrections of soft cp  violating yukawa interactions may drastically modify the couplings of the light neutral higgs boson to the gauge bosons . as a result ,",
    "the production cross sections as well as the decay branching ratios @xcite of neutral higgs bosons changes so significantly .",
    "one of the crucial modifications is that the current experimental lower bound on the lightest higgs boson mass may be dramatically relaxed up to a 60gev level in the presence of large cp violation in the higgs sector of the mssm .",
    "moreover , the explicit cp violation in the mssm higgs sector radiatively induces a finite unremovable misalignment @xcite between two higgs doublets .",
    "this additional phase can be as large as the original cp phases in certain portions of the mssm parameter space and affect the chargino and neutralino systems .",
    "therefore , it would be very important to re  visit all the relevant phenomena by including the cp  violating induced phase while avoiding the severe constraints from the neutron and electron edms . in particular , one of the most phenomenologically interesting subjects is to investigate the possibility of detecting lightest neutralinos when a large portion of the dark matter in the universe is composed of the lightest and ( almost ) stable lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .",
    "the observations of the dynamics of galaxies and clusters of galaxies @xcite , and the constraints on the baryon density from big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite requires the existence of a considerable amount of non - baryonic dark matter .",
    "therefore , it is almost universally accepted that most of the mass in the universe and most of the mass in the galactic halo is dark and the dark matter consists of some new , as yet undiscovered , weakly  interacting massive particle ( wimp ) . of the many wimp candidates , one of the best motivated and the most theoretically developed is the lightest neutralino , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) in most susy theories . in this light",

    "nucleus elastic scattering as well as the neutralino relic density @xcite .",
    "so , referring to those works for the effects from the phase @xmath0 , we will mainly concentrate on the impact of the scalar  pseudoscalar mixing and the induced phase between two higgs doublets in the mssm higgs sector stemming from the radiative corrections due to the cp  violating scalar top and bottom sectors in the mssm on the neutralino ",
    "nucleus elastic scattering . for a more concrete , quantitative investigation ,",
    "our analysis through the paper is based on a specific scenario with the following assumptions :    * the first and second generation sfermions are very heavy so that they are decoupled from the theory . in this case , there are no constraints on the cp  violating phases from the neutron and electron edms . on the other hand , the annihilation of the neutralinos into tau pairs through the exchange for relatively light scalar tau leptons guarantees that the cosmological constraints on the dark matter densities be satisfied . *",
    "the explicit cp violation in the higgs sector through the cp  violating radiative corrections from the scalar top and bottom sectors is included .",
    "* simultaneously , the effects of the induced cp  violating phase between two higgs doublets on the chargino and neutralino systems are explicitly included .",
    "* it is necessary to avoid the possible constraints from the so  called barr - zee  type diagrams @xcite to the electron and neutron edms as well as from the null results of the higgs boson searches at lep @xcite .",
    "we take two values 3 and 30 for @xmath3 , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of two neutral higgs fields in the present analysis .    certainly , the major issue concerning the supersymmetric dark matter is its detection and identification .",
    "indeed , there are a multitude of ongoing experiments involved in the direct and indirect detection of dark matter , many with a specific emphasis on searching for supersymmetric dark matter @xcite . the event rates for either direct or indirect detection depend crucially on the lsp - nucleon , or lsp - nucleus , cross - section . because the neutralinos have majorana mass terms , their interactions with matter are generally spin dependent , coming from an effective interaction term of the form @xmath14 . in the regions of the mssm parameter space where the lsp is a mixture of both gaugino and higgsino components ,",
    "there is also an important contribution to the scattering cross - section due to a term in the interaction lagrangian of the form @xmath15 @xcite which is spin independent .",
    "these terms are particularly important for scattering off of large nuclei , where coherent nucleon scattering effects can quickly come to dominate all others . the scalar  pseudoscalar mixing and the modified couplings of the neutral higgs bosons to fermions and neutralinos affect the spin ",

    "ii , a brief review on the explicit cp violation in the higgs sector is given following the work by pilaftsis and wager @xcite .",
    "section iii is devoted to a detailed analysis of various effects of the cp  violating induced phase between two higgs doublets on the chargino and neutralino sectors .",

    "finally , we summarize our findings and conclude in section v.",
    "the mssm introduces several new parameters in the theory that are absent from the sm and could , in principle , possess many cp  violating phases .",
    "specifically , the new cp phases may come from the following parameters : ( i ) the higgsino mass parameter @xmath13 , which involves the bilinear mixing of the two higgs chiral superfields in the superpotential ; ( ii ) the soft susy  breaking gaugino masses @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , where the index @xmath19 stands for the gauge groups u(1)@xmath20 , su(2)@xmath21 and su(3)@xmath22 , respectively ; ( iii ) the soft bilinear higgs mixing masses @xmath23 , which is sometimes denoted as @xmath24 in the literature ; ( iv ) the soft trilinear yukawa couplings @xmath25 of the higgs particles to scalar fermions ; and ( v ) the flavor mixing elements of the sfermions mass matrices . if the universality condition is imposed on all gaugino masses at the unification scale @xmath26 , the gaugino masses @xmath17 have a common phase , and if the diagonal boundary conditions are added to the universality condition for the sfermion mass matrices at the gut scale , the flavor mixing elements of the sfermions mass matrices vanish and the different trilinear couplings @xmath25 are all equal , i.e. @xmath27 .    the conformal",
    " invariant part of the mssm lagrangian has two global u(1 ) symmetries ; the u(1)@xmath28 peccei  quinn symmetry and the u(1)@xmath29 symmetry acting on the grassmann  valued coordinates . as a consequence , not all cp ",

    "these parameters are in general complex and so lead to cp violation in the higgs sector through radiative corrections .",
    "the explicit form of the couplings with radiative corrections can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is necessary to determine the ground state of the higgs potential to obtain physical higgs states and their self  interactions . to this end",
    "we introduce the linear decompositions of the higgs fields @xmath40 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 the moduli of the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the higgs doublets and @xmath43 their cp  violating induced relative phase .",
    "these vevs and the relative phase can be determined by the minimization conditions on @xmath44 , which can be efficiently performed by the so  called tadpole renormalization techniques @xcite .",
    "it is always guaranteed that one combination of the cp ",
    "odd higgs fields @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) defines a flat direction in the higgs potential and so it is absorbed as the longitudinal component of the @xmath48 boson . [ here , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . ] as a result , there exist one charged higgs state and three neutral higgs states that are mixed in the presence of cp violation in the higgs sector . denoting the remaining cp ",
    "odd state @xmath51 , the @xmath52 neutral higgs  boson mass matrix describing the mixing between cp  even and cp  odd fields can be decomposed into four parts in the weak basis @xmath53 : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 describe the cp  preserving transitions @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively , and @xmath59 contains the cp  violating mixings @xmath60 .",
    "the analytic form of the sub  matrices can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    on the other hand , the charged higgs - boson mass @xmath61 is related to the pseudoscalar mass term @xmath62 as @xmath63 taking this very last relation between @xmath61 and @xmath62 into account",

    "since the higgs  boson mass matrix @xmath65 describing the scalar  pseudoscalar mixing is symmetric , we can diagonalize it by means of an orthogonal rotation @xmath66 ; @xmath67 with the ordering of masses @xmath68",
    ". the neutral higgs ",
    "boson mixing affects the couplings of the higgs fields to fermions , gauge bosons , and higgs fields themselves as shown in the following .",
    "the cp  violating effects due to radiative corrections to the higgs potential is characterized by a dimensionless parameter @xmath69 @xmath70 where @xmath71 , i.e. the sum of three cp  violating phases .",
    "so , for @xmath1 and/or @xmath2 values larger than the susy  breaking scale @xmath64 , the cp  violating effects can be significant .",
    "as shown in the previous section , the first derivatives of the higgs potention with respect to the neutral fields @xmath72 do not vanish any longer ; hence , one has to redefine the higgs doublet fields with a relative phase @xmath43 .",
    "this cp  violating induced phase can be obtained analytically by combining the two relations for the minimization .",
    "first of all , we make use of the fact that a u(1)@xmath73 rotation allows us to take @xmath23 to be real and for a notational convenience define @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 ; @xmath77 then , the cp  violating induced phase @xmath43 is determined by the relations ; @xmath78 and the soft  breaking positive bilinear mass squared @xmath23 is given by @xmath79 we note that the induced phase vanishes if @xmath80 , the sum of the phases @xmath0 and @xmath81 , vanishes , even if each of the cp  violating phases might not have to vanish .",
    "on the other hand , the size of @xmath75 or @xmath76 is proportional to the pseudoscalar mass @xmath62 to a very good approximation so that if it becomes large , i.e , decoupled , the induced phase @xmath43 is diminished .",
    "since the size of the induced phase is also inversely proportional to @xmath82 , the phase grows with increasing @xmath3 . in general",
    ", this induced phase will remain as a non  trivial physical phase and lead to a modification in the chargino and neutralino mass matrices .",
    "analytically , the induced phase @xmath43 palys a role of rotating the vacuum expectation value @xmath42 into @xmath83 .",
    "so , the chargino mass matrix is given in the @xmath84 basis by @xmath85 which is built up by the fundamental susy parameters ; the su(2 ) gaugino mass @xmath86 , the higgsino mass parameter @xmath1 , its phase @xmath0 and the ratio @xmath3 of the vacuum expectation values of the two neutral higgs doublet fields has an opposite sign to the conventional one in the literature .",
    "this is the reason why there appears a negative sign in the @xmath87 component of the chargino mass matrix . ]",
    "the gaugino mass @xmath86 was made real already by appropriate field redefinitions . since the chargino mass matrix @xmath88 is not symmetric , two different unitary matrices acting on the left and right ",

    ", one can infer the following aspects :    * even if @xmath0 vanishes there is still a source of cp violation due to the presence of the induced phase @xmath43 stemming from the cp  violating phases in the scalar top and bottom sectors . *",
    "if both @xmath0 and @xmath4 vanish as in the cp  invariant theory , then the induced phase @xmath43 vanishes , leaving no source of cp violation .",
    "these effects may be investigated through the chargino pair production as soon as the collider energies become high enough to go over their production thresholds .",
    "however , this investigation is beyond the regime of the present work and so , it will be not touched upon here .",
    "similarly , the neutralino mass matrix describing neutralino mixing is modified by the introduction of the cp  violating induced phase .",
    "following the same prescription for the chargino mass matrix yields the neutralino mass matrix in the @xmath94 basis : @xmath95 the neutralino mass matrix @xmath96 is a complex but symmetric matrix so that it can be diagonalized by just one unitary matrix @xmath97 such that @xmath98 with the increasing ordering in masses .",
    "a simple orthogonality transformation of a phase matrix enables one to confirm that any physical observable related with the neutralino mixing depends only on the phase @xmath99 and the combination @xmath93 of the phases @xmath0 and @xmath43 as in the chargino system .",
    "so , it is clear that except for the phase @xmath99 the neutralino system exhibits a similar dependence on the phase @xmath0 and the induced phase @xmath43 . in the present work ,",
    "we take the assumption of gaugino mass unification for which the phase @xmath99 should be zero at least up to one  loop level against the renormalization group running from the unification scale to the electroweak scale . in this scenario , there exists only one cp  violating rephasing ",
    "invariant phase @xmath93 in the chargino and neutralino mass sectors .",
    "in this section we investigate the importance of the cp - violating phases on the elastic scattering cross - sections of neutralinos on nuclei . to this end , we calculate the four - fermi effective @xmath100-quark interaction lagrangian with the inclusion of the cp violating phases @xmath0 , @xmath99 , and @xmath43 for the standard spin  dependent and spin  independent neutralino  nucleus interactions .",
    "there are two types of diagrams contributing to the elastic scattering ; @xmath48-exchange diagram and neutral higgs boson exchange diagrams as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "in order to derive the analytic expression for the scattering cross sections , it is necessary to determine the interactions of the @xmath48 and higgs bosons to neutralinos and fermions .",
    "firstly , the interactions of the neutral higgs fields with sm fermions are described by the lagrangian @xmath101d     + \\frac{gm_u}{2m_w c_\\beta }      \\bar{u}\\left[o_{3\\alpha}-i c_\\beta o_{1\\alpha}\\gamma_5\\right]u      \\right\\}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath102 denotes one of up  type fermions and @xmath103 one of down  type fermions .",
    "obviously , the higgs  fermion ",
    "fermion couplings are significant for the third  generation fermions , @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 because of their relatively large yukawa couplings . on the contrary , because any ordinary nucleus is mainly composed of the first ( and second ) generation fermions , the couplings are very small .",
    "nevertheless , these contributions become important for a nucleus with a large atomic / mass number , because they can contribute to the spin  independent cross section in a coherent manner .",
    "we note in passing that the effect of cp  violating higgs mixing is to induce a simultaneous coupling of @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) to cp  even and cp  odd fermion bilinears @xmath109 and @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "this can lead to a sizable phenomenon of cp violation in the higgs decays into polarized top - quark or tau - lepton pairs @xcite .",
    "secondly , the interactions of the higgs bosons to neutralinos involve the neutralino mixing and the higgs boson mixing simultaneously . as a result",
    ", the expression can become lengthy .",
    "so , for a notational convenience , we introduce the expression @xmath111 defined in terms of the induced phase @xmath43 , the neutralino diagonalization matrix @xmath97 , and the higgs diagonalization matrix @xmath66 as follows ; @xmath112\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then the interaction lagrangian for the couplings of the neutral higgs bosons to a lightest neutralino ",

    "we note that a sizable coupling is expected when the lsp has the significant compositions of both the gaugino states and the higgsino states .",
    "thirdly , since both @xmath115 and @xmath116 have @xmath117 , these neutral gaugino states do not couple to the @xmath48 boson .",
    "therefore , the neutral current coupling of the @xmath48 boson to neutralinos occurs only from the higgsino component of neutralinos .",

    "one the other hand , the coupling of the @xmath48 boson to fermions are not changed even in the presence of new cp  violating phases .",
    "since the recoil momenta of the nucleus in the elastic scattering of the neutralinos with fixed nuclei are very small compared to the masses of the exchanged @xmath48 and neutral higgs bosons , it is appropriate to have an effective four  fermi lagrangian by taking the momentum transfer to be zero .",

    "firstly , we note that the neutral higgs mass spectrum depends on the chargino mass @xmath61 , a susy breaking scale @xmath64 , two trilinear terms @xmath16 and their phases @xmath156 as well as @xmath3 , the higgsino mass parameter @xmath1 and its phase @xmath0 .",
    "let us assume a universal trilinear parameter in our analysis : @xmath157 .",
    "we take in our analysis @xmath158 .",
    "secondly , the neutralino masses and mixing are determined by the su(2 ) gaugino mass parameter @xmath86 , the u(1 ) gaugino mass @xmath159 and its phase @xmath99 as well as the parameters @xmath160",
    ". it will be reasonable to take the gaugino mass unification condition between two gaugino masses so that at least up to the one  loop level one have @xmath161 . in this case , the lightest neutralino will be bino  like for @xmath162 and it will be higgsino  like for @xmath163 .",
    "note that the higgsino parameter @xmath1 and its phase @xmath0 affect both the neutralino mixing and neutral higgs mixing . for a large higgs mixing , a large @xmath1 is preferred . on the contrary ,",
    "a large neutralino mixing requires a relatively small value of @xmath1 . in this light",
    ", @xmath1 is a crucial susy parameter in determining the relative importance of the spin  dependent and spin  independent contributions .",
    "we will take @xmath1 and @xmath0 as free parameters .",
    "thirdly , the spin ",
    "independent cross section strongly depends on fermion masses . for the fermion masses",
    ", we will use their maximum values coded by the particle data group @xcite : @xmath164 it is certain that there still exist large uncertainties in the values of the fermion masses .",
    "nevertheless , our numerical analysis will be qualitatively reasonable and even quantitatively meaningful with some improved determinations of fermion masses .",
    "consequently , the independent susy parameters which we manipulate in our numerical estimates of the lsp  nucleus scattering cross sections are @xmath165 we set @xmath166 and take two values 3 and 30 for @xmath3 which will satisfy the constraints from the higgs search experiments at lep@xcite and the 2loop barr  zee  type electron and neutron edms .",
    "we are now ready to show the importance of the cp  violating phases in the lsp detection through the lsp  nucleus elastic scattering . for a systematic analysis ,",
    "it is useful to understand the dependence of the cp  violating induced phase on the parameters @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "incidentally , the induced phase depends only on one combination of two phases @xmath167 .",
    "so , for this analysis , we simply introduce @xmath168 and set the phase to be @xmath169 , which will give ( almost ) the maximal absolute value of @xmath170 . in this case",
    ", the sine of the induced phase is determined by the higgsino mass parameter @xmath1 and the charged higgs mass for which we take into account two values ; 250 gev and 500 gev .",
    "also , @xmath170 in this limit is is given by a simple analytical expression @xmath171 therefore , @xmath170 is always negative and it is expected that the existence of @xmath82 in the denominator forces its absolute value to increase with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "figure  1 shows @xmath172 as a function of the higgsino mass parameter @xmath1 by taking four different sets of @xmath173 ; @xmath174 ( solid line ) , @xmath175 ( dashed line ) , @xmath176 ( dot  dashed line ) , and @xmath177 ( dotted line ) .",
    "the values of the other susy parameters are given in the previous section .",
    "it is clear that @xmath172 increases with increasing @xmath3 but decreases with increasing the charged higgs mass @xmath61 .",
    "it depends very strongly on the higgsino mass parameter @xmath1 ; for a small @xmath3 the absolute value of @xmath170 can be at most as large as 0.1 for a large value of @xmath1 and for a relatively small value of @xmath61 , but it can be as large as unity for a large value of @xmath1 and a small value of @xmath61 .",
    "this is due to the fact that for a small value of @xmath3 the scalar top quarks contribute ( almost ) exclusively , but for a large value of @xmath3 the scalar bottom quarks as well as the scalar top quarks contribute to the cp  violating induced phase . in this light",
    ", one may expect that the cp  violating induced mass @xmath43 can affect the chargino and neutralino sectors significantly for a certain regime of the susy parameter space . however , we note that the relative size of the induced phase contribution to the chargino or neutralino mass spectrum is at most as large as @xmath178 for @xmath1 much larger than @xmath86 so that the enhancement effect in the induced phase by a large @xmath1 and a large @xmath3 is washed out through the strong suppression by the same parameters . therefore ,",
    "in most cases there are no significant modifications in the chargino and neutralino mass spectrums .    to begin with , we estimate the spin ",
    "dependent cross section . for this case",
    "we consider the scattering of neutralinos on fluorine @xmath179 , for which the spin ",
    "dependent contribution typically dominates by a factor of 20 @xcite . as shown in section  2b , the crucial parameters determining the spin ",
    "dependent cross section are the coefficients @xmath129 and on the whole by the coefficients @xmath141 and @xmath142 . because there is simply one @xmath48exchange contribution to the spin",
    " independent process , all the @xmath129 coefficients are proportional to the coupling of the @xmath48 boson to neutralinos except for their relative factors ; @xmath180 .",
    "we find by a comprehensive numerical scan on the relevant susy parameters that the cp  violating induced phase _ hardly _ changes the values of @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "this property is in a sharp contrast with the aspect that the coefficients and the spin ",
    "dependent cross section are very sensitive to @xmath0 , the phase of the higgsino . for the details of the significant dependence on the phase @xmath0",
    ", we refer to the work by falk , ferstl and olive @xcite .    on the other hand , the spin ",
    "independent cross section is dominant in much of the susy parameter space for scattering off heavy nuclei so that we consider the scattering of neutralinos on @xmath136ge .",
    "the cross section is determined by the coefficients @xmath130 which involve the contributions from the neutral higgs exchanges and the scalar part of their couplings to neutralinos and fermions .",
    "because the explicit cp violation through radiative corrections to the higgs sector can lead to a large mixing among scalar higgs bosons and pseudoscalar higgs boson , it is naturally expected to exhibit a rather strong dependence of the cross section on the phases such as the phase @xmath4 and the induced phase @xmath43 , even if the phase @xmath0 is taken to be zero in favor of the naturalness conditions at the gut scale .",
    "nevertheless , the structure of the coupling @xmath111 requires the lightest neutralino state to be composed of both gauginos and higgsinos with significant compositions .",
    "this means that a large cross section can be obtained when the gaugino mass @xmath86 and the higgsino mass parameter @xmath1 are comparable in size .    keeping in mind these aspects , we take for our numerical analysis two values of @xmath3 ( 3 and 30 ) , set @xmath181 and use the same values for the other susy parameters as those given in the previous analyses .",
    "figure  3 shows @xmath149 on the phase @xmath182 and the parameter @xmath1 is very similar to that of @xmath183 and furthermore we find that two quantities have a very similar value for the whole scanned space of the susy parameters . ] for five values of the higgsino mass parameter @xmath1 ; 200 gev ( solid line ) , 400 gev ( long dashed line ) , 600 gev ( dot  dashed line ) , 800 gev ( dotted line ) and 1000 gev ( dashed line ) . the value of @xmath3 is taken to be 3 in the left frame and 30 in the right frame , respectively .",
    "we note several interesting aspects from two figures :    * the magnitude of @xmath149 ( as well as @xmath151 ) is very sensitive to the value of @xmath1 . in most cases except for the region of large values of @xmath182",
    ", it decreases with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "the main reason for the suppression is that the lsp is gaugino  dominated for a large value @xmath1 , while an intermediate state of the lsp is required to have a sizable @xmath149 . * comparing the small and large @xmath3 cases",
    ", one can find that the magnitude of @xmath149 increases with increasing @xmath3 . * the relative sensitivity of @xmath149 to the phase @xmath182 is very much enhanced for a large value of @xmath1 , in particular for a small value of @xmath3 . in this case , @xmath149 increases by one order of magnitude as @xmath182 changes from zero to 180 degrees . as a result , one can expect to have a large lsp detection rate even for a large @xmath1 . * on the contrary , for a large @xmath3 and a large @xmath1 , the value of @xmath149 tends to be suppressed for non  trivial values around @xmath184 .    on the whole",
    ", it is clear that @xmath149 is very sensitive to @xmath1 and @xmath3 , and it becomes sensitive to the phase @xmath182 , equivalently , @xmath4 in the present work , for a large @xmath1 .",
    "however , the behavior of @xmath149 with respect to the phase @xmath182 strongly depends on the value of @xmath3 .    from the discussion in the previous paragraph",
    ", it is expected that the spin ",
    "independent cross section also will show the same behavior with respect to the susy parameters and cp  violating phases .",
    "with the fact that @xmath149 and @xmath151 are ( almost ) similar to each other in size , one can see that the spin ",
    "independent cross section is proportional to the square of @xmath149 so that the dependence of the cross section is enhanced .",
    "figure  4 shows the dependence of the spin ",
    "independent cross section @xmath185 on the phase @xmath182 with the other susy parameters as those in figure  3 .",
    "as expected , the behavior of the cross section is similar to that of @xmath149 . for @xmath186 and @xmath187 gev ,",
    "the cross section changes by one order of magnitude , depending on the phase , while the cross section tends to be suppressed for non ",
    "trivial phases in the case of a large @xmath3 .",
    "in this paper , we have re  visited the neutralino  nucleus elastic scattering process portion of dark matter in the universe under a specific susy scenario ( which has been recently suggested to avoid the severe edm constraints ) ; in the scenario , the first and second generation sfermions are so heavy that they are decoupled from the low  energy supersymmetric theories , while the third generation sfermions are required to be relatively light not to spoil naturalness . in this case , the complex parameters , in particular , the phase of the trilinear terms and the phase of the higgsino mass parameter , of the third  generation stop and sbottom sectors can lead to a significant mixing between scalar neutral higgs bosons and a pseudoscalar neutral higgs boson . as a result , there appears a cp  violating induced phase due to the misalignment between two higgs doublet fields .",
    "we have focussed on the impact of the scalar  pseudoscalar mixing and the induced phase on the lsp  nucleus elastic scattering process .    for the sake of our numerical analysis",
    ", we have assumed a universal trilinear parameters @xmath2 and @xmath4 and set the phase of the higgsino mass parameter @xmath0 to be zero , and then we have varied the charged higgs boson mass , @xmath3 , @xmath1 and the phase @xmath4 while keeping @xmath188 tev and @xmath189 tev , the susy breaking scale . to summarize",
    ", we have several interesting aspects related with the induced phase and the detection of the neutralino dark matter :    * the induced phase @xmath43 itself can be large if @xmath3 is large , and @xmath1 is comparable to @xmath64 or larger . however , we have found that in this case its contribution to chargino and neutralino masses is strongly suppressed because the contribution is determined by the combination @xmath178 . * the coupling of the @xmath48 boson to neutralinos is affected only through the cp  violating induced phase from the third generation stop and sbottom sectors .",
    "we have found that because of the mutually destructive properties mentioned before the cp  violating induced phase hardly changes the spin ",
    "dependent cross section . * the spin ",
    "independent part , to which the main contribution comes from the neutral higgs boson exchanges can undergo a big change with respect to the phase @xmath4 and the induced phase @xmath43 as well . the higgs mass spectrum and the couplings of the neutral higgs bosons to neutralinos and fermions vary very significantly with respect to the phases as well as the other susy parameters .",
    "the dimensionful parameter @xmath149 as well as @xmath151 dictating the size of the spin",
    " independent cross section increases with decreasing @xmath1 and increasing @xmath3 , while the sensitivity of the parameter to the phase @xmath182 . for a small value of @xmath186 , the sensitivity of @xmath149 and the spin ",
    "independent cross section to the phase @xmath182 can be huge for a large value of @xmath1 . on the contrary , the spin ",
    "independent cross section is suppressed for non  trivial values of the phase @xmath182 for a large value of @xmath3 .    even though we have not presented here , we have confirmed the result by falk , ferstl and olive @xcite that the spin  dependent and spin  independent cross sections are strongly dependent on the phase @xmath0 . in some cases , for a broad range of non ",
    "zero @xmath0 , there are cancellations in the cross sections which reduce both the spin  dependent and spin  independent cross sections by more than an order of magnitude . in other cases , there may be enhancements as one varies @xmath0 .",
    "in general there are several cp  violating phases which can affect many important physics phenomena .",
    "in addition to the supersymmetric cp  violating phase @xmath0 , we have found that even in the scenario of the gaugino mass unification and the decoupling of the first and second sfermion states , the cp  violating scalar  pseudoscalar neutral higgs boson mixing and the cp  violating induced phase between two higgs doublets can affect the spin  independent part of the neutralino  nucleus elastic scattering cross section significantly , depending on the values of @xmath3 , the charged higgs boson mass , the susy breaking scale , and so on .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that in the present situation of no susy signatures it is important to clearly understand the impact of all the cp  violating phases , ( which are not constrained by low ",
    "energy measurements such as the electron and neutron edms ) , on the neutralino  nucleus elastic scattering , one of the most promising dark matter detection mechanism .",

    "the author wishes to acknowledge the financial support of 1997sughak program of korea research foundation .",
    "0.3 cm while finalizing our paper , we became aware of one very recent work @xcite by gondolo and freese which treats some of the features we have been studying here . in the paper , they have mainly concentrated on the scalar  pseudoscalar mixing and have provided a global parameter scan in estimating the elastic scattering cross section .",
    "instead , our work have studied the effect of the cp  violating induced phase between two higgs doublets as well as of the scalar  pseudoscalar mixing .    for reviews ,",
