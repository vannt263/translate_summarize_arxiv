    "sea quarks are an important ingredient of strong interaction dynamics . in the framework of quantum chromodynamics ,",
    "however , quantitative calculations of their effects on hadron phenomenology have proven to be notoriously difficult , unless one resorts to approximations based on additional model assumptions .",
    "nevertheless , the _ ab initio _ approach of lattice gauge theory towards the sea quark problem has shown steady progress over the past decade : recently the @xmath1-problem has been tackled successfully on the lattice  @xcite where sea quarks induce the axial anomaly in the sense of the witten - veneziano mechanism  @xcite .",
    "another example is the strong decay of hadrons through light quark - antiquark pair creation , for instance the transition from a colour string configuration between two static colour sources , @xmath2 , into a pair of static - light mesons , @xmath3 .",
    "this colour string breaking , which we address in this paper , is expected to occur as soon as the colour source - sink separation , @xmath4 , exceeds a certain threshold value , @xmath5 .    in lattice simulations",
    "this behaviour has been investigated in four dimensional qcd at zero temperature @xmath6 with sea quarks  @xcite as well as in qcd@xmath7  @xcite .",
    "however , these studies lacked compelling evidence of string breaking situation appears to be more favourable @xcite . ] .",
    "this failure is due to problems like : _ (",
    "i ) _ string breaking investigations only make sense in a full qcd setting with large ensemble sizes . _",
    "( ii ) _ string breaking occurs at distances beyond 1  fm , a regime with a poor signal - to - noise ratio . _ ( iii ) _ the poor overlap of the @xmath2 creation operator with the large - distance @xmath3 ground state .",
    "this last problem necessitates to resolve the signal at huge euclidean times @xmath8 , unless one bases the investigation on a @xmath9 correlation matrix , whose additional elements include the insertion of light quark propagators into the standard wilson loop  @xcite .",
    "such quark insertions require propagators from any source to any sink position ( `` all - to - all propagators '' ) , in order to enable the exploitation of translational invariance for error reduction ( self averaging ) .",

    "we refer to the difference between the physical eigenstates and the @xmath2 and @xmath3 basis as `` mixing '' .",
    "such mixing should manifest itself `` explicitly '' , by non - vanishing off - diagonal matrix elements , relative to the diagonal matrix elements , and `` implicitly '' .",
    "the latter refers either to the wilson loop @xmath12 decaying into the mass of the ( dominantly ) @xmath3 state for @xmath13 or to a decay of @xmath14 towards the @xmath2 mass for @xmath15 , as @xmath16 .",
    "implicit mixing is much harder to detect than explicit mixing .    in the quenched approximation baryon and",
    "anti - baryon numbers are separately conserved and the @xmath2 and @xmath3 sectors are mutually orthogonal . by definition ,",
    "@xmath10 vanishes and there will be no mixing .",
    "this does not mean however , that the matrix elements accompanying the explicit @xmath10- and @xmath17-factors are necessarily _",
    "zero_.    so far string breaking has been verified in the following cases : in @xmath18 gauge theory with a fundamental scalar field in three dimensions  @xcite and in four dimensions  @xcite as well as for the @xmath18 potential between adjoint sources ( screened by the gluons ) in three dimensions  @xcite and in four dimensions  @xcite . however , in only one of these studies  @xcite , and in a recent simulation of the 3d @xmath19-higgs model  @xcite , _ implicit _ string breaking has been convincingly demonstrated .",
    "let us recall the signature of string breaking : without mixing , the @xmath2 and the @xmath3 are qcd eigenstates and will undergo a plain level crossing ( with minimal energy gap @xmath20 ) , at a certain critical distance @xmath21 .",
    "simulations with @xmath22 show exactly this behaviour .",
    "in contrast , with @xmath23 creation / annihilation switched on , the fock states will undergo sizeable mixing in the neighbourhood of @xmath21 .",
    "the minimal energy gap @xmath24 between the two eigenstates will grow with the spatial width of the mixing region .",
    "the transition rate between @xmath2 and @xmath3 states is given by the ( normalized ) time derivative of the off - diagonal matrix element , @xmath25_{t=0}[c_{bb}(0)c_{qq}(0)]^{-1/2}$ ] .",
    "from a string picture as well as from strong coupling arguments one would expect a more pronounced mixing in larger space - time dimensions @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , the size of the energy gap within the string breaking region should increase as one goes from @xmath27 to @xmath28 . in the large @xmath29 limit we find , @xmath30 , for the potential between fundamental sources , screened by @xmath10 flavours of fundamental scalar or quark fields . for the breaking of the adjoint potential",
    "this translates into , @xmath31 .    the figures of refs .",
    "@xcite for the adjoint string in 3d @xmath18 gauge theory suggest the following upper limits for the size of the energy gap , expressed in units of the string breaking distance : @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively . in 4d @xmath18 gauge theory",
    "one finds , @xmath34  @xcite , whereas refs .",
    "@xcite show that the fundamental 3d @xmath18 string , screened by a scalar field , satisfies @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "in all these cases either the spatial resolution of the string breaking region was too coarse or the statistical errors were too large to allow for the determination of a lower bound .",
    "based on the qualitative @xmath10 , @xmath29 and @xmath26-dependencies discussed above , we expect the @xmath0 qcd energy gap to be somewhat bigger than the gaps quoted for the toy model studies .",
    "from this reasoning we would aim at an error of @xmath37 , smaller than 0.1 .",
    "to meet this constraint , we require a distance resolution in the string breaking region of @xmath38  fm , where @xmath39 denotes the string tension .",

    "in fact we do not only find hpa to improve tea but the main effect of hpa is with respect to set : the cancellation of stochastic noise is accelerated if the number of contributions to the stochastic average is reduced . short - distance noise is accompanied by larger amplitudes than large - distance noise and hence its cancellation requires a comparatively larger number of noise vectors .",
    "hpa explicitly eliminates such short - distance contributions .",
    "the benefit from hpa will increase with larger temporal or spatial distances .",
    "unfortunately , in the limit of light quark masses , as @xmath319 approaches @xmath320 , the quark propagator will decay less rapidly with the distance and the explicit treatment of the first few terms within the hopping parameter expansion will have less of an effect .",
    "this is also obvious from the reduced convergence of the hopping parameter expansion at small quark masses . in this case",
    "we would however expect a better convergence of the tea contribution in the first place .",
    "note that hpa exploits the ultra - locality of the wilson action and does not generalize for instance to the neuberger action  @xcite .",

    "string breaking provides an intuitive example of a strong decay .",
    "in addition , static potentials can readily be related to quarkonium physics : this can be achieved by introducing a phenomenological born - oppenheimer approximation  @xcite or , more systematically , within the framework of potential nrqcd ( pnrqcd )  @xcite . as long as the quarkonium state in question is much lighter than the respective strong decay threshold into a pair of heavy - light mesons",
    ", the ground state energy level @xmath571 should , to leading order in the relative @xmath2 velocity @xmath593 , accurately encapsulate the relevant physics .",
    "if this is not the case anymore , then additional terms have to be added to the pnrqcd lagrangian , to incorporate the @xmath447 sector and transitions between the two sectors : when it comes to strong decays like @xmath152 , @xmath475 and the transition rate / coupling @xmath506 [ or , equivalently , the mixing angle @xmath474 ] are required to describe the system , in addition to @xmath571 .",
    "for states that are stable against such decay , but which are in the vicinity of a threshold , mixing effects will result in mass shifts  @xcite .",

    "we would expect this medium range @xmath500 value to somewhat decrease with lighter quark masses and @xmath601 to increase .    in qcd with sea quarks",
    "there are not only @xmath3 excitations present but also @xmath2-gluon hybrid potentials .",
    "these however are energetically higher and , unless we are interested in hybrid quarkonia with spin - exotic quantum numbers , not a dominant correction  @xcite to quark potential model predictions .",
    "obviously , hybrid meson mixing and decay is interesting in itself  @xcite , and , in this context , a detailed study of the breaking of hybrid strings would be interesting .",
    "finally , at light sea quark masses hadronic transitions between quarkonia , mediated by @xmath154 radiation , become possible , the inclusion of which necessitates further modifications .",
    "we were able to resolve the string breaking problem in @xmath0 qcd , at one value of the lattice spacing @xmath180  gev and of the sea quark mass , @xmath495 .    to achieve this result , the systematic improvement of our methods beyond the latest lattice technology was crucial .",
    "in particular , we used highly optimized smearing functions to enhance the overlap of our test wave functions with the physical states , we employed an improved static action and we realized many off - axis source separations .",
    "we used stochastic estimator techniques ( set ) to calculate all - to - all propagators .",
    "the variance of set was reduced by exactly calculating the contribution from the lowest lying eigenmodes of @xmath43 , where @xmath41 denotes the wilson dirac matrix .",
    "further variance reduction was achieved by the ( new ) hopping parameter acceleration ( hpa ) technique .",
    "these methods , most of which are neither specific to the string breaking problem nor to the static charge sector of lattice qcd , can readily be applied to a large spectrum of problems . in general",
    "we would expect the gain factor from hpa to decrease at lighter sea quark masses while the improved convergence of tea should compensate for this .",
    "we determined a mixing angle @xmath474 . truncating the fock basis after states containing four quark operators , the @xmath2 component of the physical ground state",
    "was given by @xmath602 and the @xmath3 content by @xmath603 .",
    "we distinguished between the explicit and the implicit detection of mixing effects : a non - vanishing transition element between @xmath2 and @xmath3 states is an explicit signal of mixing .",

    "we were unable to detect this signal in the @xmath2 sector alone . based on our mixing analysis",
    ", we expect such an implicit detection of string breaking to be almost hopeless , as high precision wilson loop data at euclidean times @xmath604 would be necessary  and this at distances @xmath605  fm !",
    "we defined two string breaking distances : @xmath606  fm denotes the distance at which the energy gap between the two levels @xmath485 assumes its minimal value @xmath607  mev while @xmath608  fm denotes the distance of perfect mixing between the two states , in terms of the mixing angle @xmath609 .",
    "the conversion into physical units has been made by setting @xmath182  fm .",
    "note that @xmath610 is compatible with zero , within a standard deviation of less than @xmath611  fm .",
    "we would expect @xmath492  mev to increase with lighter sea quark masses and hence this value should be regarded as a lower limit to the case with massless or very light sea quarks . in real qcd also the string breaking distance should decrease .",
    "we estimate @xmath612  fm for this case .",
    "the first error is statistical and from the chiral extrapolation of previous results , the second incorporates possible finite lattice spacing effects , the scale uncertainty in @xmath182  fm and effects due to the inclusion of a third active sea quark flavour .",
    "the qualitative situation is depicted in figure  [ fig : final ] .",
    "we can define a transition rate @xmath613/2 $ ] between @xmath2 and @xmath3 states and note that @xmath614 and hence @xmath615 . in the large @xmath29 limit",
    "this means that at leading order , @xmath616 , if we are interested in the screening of a fundamental string by a sea of @xmath10 massless flavours of fundamental particles , e.g.  scalars or quarks . for the breaking of an adjoint string into two gluelumps the expectation reads , @xmath617",
