    "channel polarization was introduced in  @xcite for binary input discrete memoryless channels as a coding technique to construct codes  called polar codes  for data transmission .",
    "polar codes are capable of achieving the ` symmetric capacity ' of any binary input channel , using low - complexity encoding and decoding algorithms . in terms of the block - length @xmath0",
    ", polar codes can be encoded and decoded in complexity @xmath1 and achieve a block error probability that decays roughly like @xmath2 .",
    "the latter result was shown in  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this note is to extend these results of  @xcite to dmcs with @xmath3-ary inputs for any finite integer @xmath4 . to that end , we recall the polarization construction and outline how the results above were shown .",

    "two independent copies of @xmath9 are first combined and then split so as to obtain two _ unequal _ binary input channels @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the channel @xmath12 describes two uses of the channel @xmath9 , @xmath13 the input @xmath14 to the channel @xmath15 are put in one - to - one correspondence with @xmath16 via @xmath17 , @xmath18 , thus obtaining the _ combined _ channel @xmath19 described by @xmath20 the _ split _ is inspired by the chain rule of mutual information : let @xmath21 be random variables corresponding to their lowercase versions above . if @xmath22 are independent and uniformly distributed , then so are @xmath23 and consequently , on the one hand , @xmath24 the split channels @xmath10 and @xmath11 describe those that occur on the right hand side of the equation above : @xmath25 so that @xmath26 and @xmath27 .    the polarization construction given in  @xcite",
    "is obtained by a repeated application of @xmath28 . since both @xmath10 and @xmath11 are binary input channels , one can obtain @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "after @xmath33 levels of application , one obtains @xmath34 channels @xmath35 .",
    "the main observation in  @xcite is that these channels polarize in the following sense :    [ prop : bipolar ] for any @xmath36 , @xmath37    in other words , except for a vanishing fraction , all the channels obtained at level @xmath33 are either almost perfect , @xmath38 , or almost pure noise , @xmath39 .",

    "for this reason , it is appropriate to think of a randomized channel combining / splitting operation , where the randomness is over the choice of @xmath205 . to accomodate this randomness ,",

    "therefore , randomness is needed only in order to find such transformations at code construction stage , and not for encoding / decoding .    in a channel polarization construction of size @xmath0 , there are @xmath230 channels ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath231 , @xmath232 , etc . ) in the recursion tree of code construction . for each channel @xmath233 residing in any one of the @xmath234 internal nodes of this tree , we need to find a suitable permutation @xmath205 such that @xmath235 .",
    "thus , the total complexity of finding the right permutations scales as @xmath236 , in the worst case where all @xmath228 permutations are considered .",
    "recall that polar code construction also requires determining the _ frozen _ coordinates , which is a task of complexity @xmath237 at best .",
    "so , the order of polar code construction complexity is not altered by the introduction of randomization .",
    "the transformation @xmath238 described above uses a random permutation to satisfy @xmath46 .",
    "this amount of randomness  over a set of size @xmath228  is in general not necessary , randomization over a set of size @xmath239 is sufficient :    if the random permutation @xmath210 that defines is chosen uniformly over the set of permutations for which @xmath161 is a fixed point , the resulting transformation yields @xmath46 and thus is polarizing .",
    "a more significant reduction in randomness can be attained when the input alphabet @xmath145 can be equipped with operations @xmath240 to form an algebraic field  this is possible if and only if @xmath3 is a prime power .",

    "when the input alphabet size @xmath3 is not prime , an alternative multi - level code construction technique can be used in order to avoid randomness : consider a channel @xmath9 with input alphabet size @xmath259 , where @xmath260 s are the prime factors of @xmath3 . when the input @xmath261 to @xmath9 is uniformly distributed on @xmath145 ,",

    ", the input letters of the channel under consideration were used with equal frequency .",
    "this was sufficient to achieve the symmetric channel capacity .",
    "however , in order to achieve the true channel capacity , one should be able to use the channel inputs with non - uniform frequencies in general .",
    "the following method , discussed in @xcite , shows how to implement non - uniform input distributions within the polar coding framework",
