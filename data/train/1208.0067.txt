    "precision measurement is one of the essential tasks in the study of modern physics .",
    "the ( micro- or nano- ) mechanical resonators ( mrs ) hold the promise for realizing precision measurements due to the possibility of presenting both classical and quantum properties  @xcite . for measurements approaching quantum limit  @xcite with mechanical systems",
    ", we have to cool the mrs to their ground states and show obvious quantum behavior . up to now , various methods for mr cooling have been proposed in optomechanical and electromechanical systems , such as feedback cooling prb-78 - 134301 , nature-460 - 724 , nature-432 - 200 , backaction sideband cooling @xcite , bang - bang cooling  zhang - prl , electromagnetically induced transparency cooling prl-103 - 227203 , measurement - based cooling @xcite , and thermal light cooling @xcite , some of which have been achieved experimentally @xcite .",
    "the precision measurement based on mrs can be classified by two kinds of systems , i.e. , optomechanical and electromechanical systems .",
    "we focus in the present work on the optomechanical system , in which the precision measurements were usually carried out via the correlations between the output spectra and measured quantities based on reflected noise physics-2 - 40 .",
    "for example , precision measurement of displacement of the mr has been achieved with a factor of five times higher than standard quantum limit in optical output spectra @xcite , and a recent experimental report was published for displacement measurement of the mr beyond standard quantum limit @xcite .",
    "the optomechanically induced transparency ( omit ) is a kind of induced transparency caused by radiation pressure to couple light to mr modes science-330 - 1520 .",
    "recently , the omit in optomechanical system has been predicted theoretically @xcite and also observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "however , the application of omit has not yet been fully explored . as far as we know , the proposed applications are only for slow light with omit controlling the speed of light @xcite and for single photon router with omit to control the probe field in a single photon fock state @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to detect the charge number of a small charged body via omit in an opto - mechanical and electrical system .",
    "the coulomb interaction between a charged mr and a nearby charged body in such a hybrid system will modify both the steady - state position of the mr and the mean photon number in the cavity , which affect significantly the window width of the omit @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the charge number of the charged object is possibly detected via monitoring the modified window width of the omit .",
    "our study shows that the window widths in some special regions of the omit vary with the charge number in a sensitive way , which makes it possible for a precision measurement of the charge number .",
    "we notice that previous ideas for ultra - sensitive measurements in opto - mechanical systems , e.g. , cavity optomechanical magnetometer @xcite and displacement measurement @xcite , are based on quantum noise backaction physics-2 - 40 .",
    "in contrast , the noise backaction is unnecessary in our case because the output intensity of the probe field is monitored via the omit based on the expectation of massive photons .",
    "moreover , conventional mr electrometers , such as vibrating reed electrometers @xcite , are formed by movable and fixed electrodes , which can be used to measure the coulomb forces with variable capacitors . limited by the extremely sensitive electricity , e.g. , @xmath0 aa current @xcite , however , the mr electrometers can not measure the charge densities in tiny objects ( e.g. , @xmath1 nm @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , since optical measurements are usually more sensitive than electrical ones , our scheme in an optical way should work well even for detecting single charges in very small objects . furthermore",
    ", our scheme makes use of the unique feature of optomechanical measurements which is considered to have higher sensitivity than electromechanical measurements @xcite .",
    "our system consisting of both an optomechanical system and a charged object is actually a cavity opto - electromechanical system , belonging to a currently active research area .",
    "for example , a recent idea for detecting electric gradient force was proposed by using a net dipole moment in a microtoroid @xcite . in comparison",
    ", our scheme using omit can be applied to measure weaker force since the net charge density on a metal surface can be much higher than the net dipole moment density in a semiconduction surface .",
    "moreover , there was a proposal to measure displacements and forces by noise spectra @xcite . honestly speaking , our scheme based on the expectation of massive photons",
    "might not work better than in ref .",
    "@xcite ( concrete estimates will be given later in the section of conclusion ) .",
    "but our focus is on the electric charge detection , which is a practical application of omit .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : we present the model and hamiltonian of the system in next section , and study the output field for the omit in sec .",
    "the relationship between the charge number and the output field as well as the feasibility of our scheme is described in sec .",
    "iv . the last section is for a brief conclusion .",
    "the model we consider is sketched in fig .  [ fig 1 ] , where a high - quality cavity consists of a fixed mirror and a movable one , i.e. , a mr . besides the radiation pressure force coupling the mr to the cavity mode , the charged mr is subject to the coulomb force due to the charged body nearby .",
    "such a system can be described as @xmath2.% \\end{array } \\label{q1 - 0}\\ ] ] here the first term is for the single - mode cavity of eigen - frequency @xmath3 with the bosonic annihilation ( creation ) operator @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) .",

    "the third term is for the radiation pressure coupling the cavity field to the mr , with @xmath10 the coupling strength and @xmath11 being the cavity length .",
    "the forth term presents the interaction of the charged mr with the charged body via a coulomb potential @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the positive charge on the mr , @xmath14 is for @xmath15 negative charges of the charged body to be detected , and @xmath16 is the distance between the equilibrium positions of the mr center - of - mass and the charged body in absence of the radiation pressure and the coulomb force . in our case with the attractive force ,",
    "the coulomb force on the mr points to the same direction as the radiation pressure force on the mr .",

    "the first condition means the frequency of the cavity to be resonant with that of the optomechanical anti - stokes sideband , which actually leads to optimal cooling .",
    "the second condition is the well - known resolved sideband condition , which ensures the omit splitting to be distinguished @xcite .",

    "the window width of the omit can be used to identify the charge number of the charged body .",
    "we show below in details how the charge number impacts the mean photon number and how to measure the charge number by the window width of the omit .    from eq .",
    "( [ q2 - 3 ] ) , we have a third - order nonlinear equation for the mr position @xmath65 , @xmath66 with @xmath67    to get a more intuitive understanding of the role that the coulomb interaction plays in eqs .",

    "( [ q3 - 11 ] ) as @xmath69with @xmath70 being the mean photon number in absence of the coulomb interaction between the mr and charged object .",
    "the above equation means that , for no charge in the system , the mr has a steady - state position @xmath71 under the action of pumping field . in the presence of the attractive coulomb interaction between the charged body and the mr , the steady - state position of the mr",
    "is modified . in the case of @xmath72 ,",
    "the steady - state position @xmath73 reduces to a function of charge number in the object .",
    "the phenomena have been shown in fig . [",

    "moreover , from eqs .",
    "( [ q2 - 3 ] ) and ( [ q3 - 4 ] ) , the mean photon number takes the form of @xmath74 which implies that the photon number increases ( decreases ) with the charge number for @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) in the case of the fixed pumping field .",
    "so there should be a maximal photon number with respect to the change of the charge number , as demonstrated in fig .",

    "the steady - state position increases monotonously with the charge number , while the mean photon number is a pulse - like curve . in the scope of charge number from @xmath94  to @xmath95",
    ", there is a little difference between the exact values and approximate values of both @xmath96  and @xmath77 .",

    "( [ q2 - 7 ] ) .",
    "the parameter values are the same as in fig .",

    "[ fig 2 ] ) . compared with the exact results , the simplified expression of the output field eq .",
    "( [ q2 - 6 ] ) is justified . moreover , from fig .",
    "[ fig 2 ] , we see that the absorption vanishes at @xmath101 ( i.e. , @xmath102 ) and the window width of the omit increases with the charge number @xmath15 .",
    "so we are able to detect the charge number of a nearby charged object by the omit .",
    "in addition , in our case with @xmath103 , the values in the figure can be straightforwardly reduced to those of non - charge case as in ref .",
    "@xcite .     for tuning point versus the charge number @xmath15 .",
    "except the values in the inset , other parameter values are the same as in fig .",
    "2.,width=302 ]    for clarifying the efficiency and the effect of our scheme , we consider a fixed charge number @xmath15 in the charged object .",
    "there are three tuning points in the real part of the output field versus the detuning @xmath104 , @xmath105 which can be obtained by solving @xmath106 . excluding the trivial case of @xmath107 and considering the symmetry of @xmath108 and @xmath109 , we take the tuning point @xmath108 as an example in fig . [ fig4 ] for different masses and charges . since the parameters used in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] satisfy @xmath110 , we may reduce eq . (",
    "15 ) to @xmath111 . therefore , by changing the mr s effective mass @xmath9 and the mr s",
    "charge @xmath26 , we present three typically different relationships between the detuning @xmath108 and the charge number @xmath15 : ( 1 ) the monotonous increase ( i.e , the gray asterisk and blue solid curves ) ; ( 2 ) the monotonous decrease ( i.e. , the red dotted and the black dotted - dashed curves ) ; ( 3 ) the curve with a hump in the middle ( i.e. , the green dashed curve ) .",
    "the curves indicate that the heavy ( light ) mr is suitable for detecting large ( small ) charge numbers .",
    "in addition , although the mr with intermediate mass seems useless in our scheme , the charge number before the hump ( @xmath112 ) in fig .",
    "4 can still be used to detect the charge number . moreover , for the same mass of the mr , the lower the applied voltage , the less tilting the curve in fig .",
    "4 . as a result , to detect more precisely the tiny charge , e.g. , a single charge , we should increase the voltage to obtain more precise resolution .",
    "we would like to point out that the analytical solutions to our detection scheme are based on some approximations ( @xmath72 and @xmath113 ) , which have been justified by numerical calculation with the parameter values we used .",
    "it has been shown that the mr with an effective mass of @xmath114 ng and a voltage of @xmath115 v is more suitable than others to measure the small charge number ( see black dotted - dashed curves in fig . [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "experimentally , the effective mass of a mr as small as 50 pg has been achieved @xcite .",
    "so we may expect to have better detection with the mrs of such small effective masses .",
    "in addition , from the parameters for the curves in fig .",
    "4 , we can infer the minimal coulomb force detected by our scheme , which is @xmath116 nn , much weaker than the minimal electrical gradient force @xmath117 @xmath118n in @xcite , but larger than the tiny force @xmath119 an detectable in ref .",
    "nevertheless , our scheme focuses on the detection of charge number , rather than the force . moreover , the highest sensitivity of the surface charge density in our scheme is about @xmath120 @xmath121 , which is of the same order as the one ( @xmath122 @xmath123 ) in ref .",
    "the sensitivity in our case can be further enhanced by increasing the bias gate voltage or decreasing the mass of the mr .    in summary ,",
    "we have demonstrated how to realize precision measurement of small charge number of the charged object via monitoring the omit in optomechanical system in the presence of the coulomb interaction between the charged mr and the object . from the analytical relationship we obtained for the omit window width with the charge number in a small charged body , we have shown the possibility of detecting few charges ( even a single charge ) from the output spectra of the omit .",
    "the feasibility of our proposal has been assessed by using currently available parameters , and the coulomb attraction under our consideration can be straightforwardly extended to coulomb repulsion .",
    "we believe that the proposal would be helpful for exploring quantum behavior in mrs and for precision measurement using omit .",
