    "exclusive double diffractive production ( edd ) of the higgs boson has been suggested some time ago as alternative to inclusive measurements @xcite . exclusive diffractive dijets production attracted recently a lot of attention due to new data from cdf run ii @xcite .",
    "the standard approach for the calculation of central dijets production in proton-(anti)proton collisions is based on the kaidalov - khoze - martin - ryskin ( kkmr ) qcd mechanism which was initially developed for the central exclusive higgs production in refs .",
    "@xcite which is expected to provide a really robust signal due to a clean environment and highly suppressed backgrounds ( see , e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) . for more details on the central exclusive processes and related physics ,",
    "we refer to the most recent reviews in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is known , however , that the process @xmath4 is dominated by the non - perturbative region of gluon transverse momenta , and even perturbative ingredients like the sudakov form factor are not under full theoretical control @xcite .",
    "uncertainties on exclusive diffractive production of higgs at the lhc were discussed in ref .  @xcite together with uncertainties on gluonic jet production which was measured by the cdf collaboration .",
    "the problem becomes even more pronounced when considering the irreducible backgrounds in central exclusive production of higgs boson originating from the direct exclusive @xmath3 pair production in a fusion of two off - shell gluons .",
    "in particular , in ref .  @xcite it was shown that the central exclusive production ( cep ) of @xmath3 jets at lhc ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : backgr ] ) , may totally shadow the corresponding signal of the higgs boson in the @xmath3 channel ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : higgs - dec ] ) , which may lead to significant problems in experimental identification .",
    "therefore , it becomes very important to investigate the exclusive quark jets production in different kinematical domains and quantify the related theoretical uncertainties . on the other hand ,",

    "[ fig : backgr].,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    unpolarized exclusive @xmath6 and @xmath7 jets production was investigated numerically in ref .  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the whole process is dominated by quark / antiquark production with low transverse momentum @xmath1 in the very forward limit of outgoing protons , whereas it is strongly suppressed at high @xmath1 s , much stronger than in inclusive case .",
    "the same should hold for @xmath8 and @xmath9 jets cep , which constitutes the major part of the irreducible background for central exclusive higgs production . as was demonstrated numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite , such a background turned out to be dominated by small gluon transverse momenta @xmath10 ( which are the same for both active and screening gluons in the forward limit ) coming into hard subprocess amplitude @xmath11 contracted with the gluon transverse polarization vectors @xmath12 and integrated over in the diffractive amplitude . the presence of the screening gluon in the loop , actually , violates the well known @xmath13 selection rule @xcite , which was initially established in one - step mechanisms , like @xmath14 and @xmath15 fusion processes .",
    "such a violation manifests itself in the fact that the hard subprocess amplitude is non - zeroth and proportional to gluon transverse momentum , and it is indeed strongly suppressed only in the high quark transverse momentum limit , whereas in the low-@xmath1 limit it may lead to a significant contribution @xcite .",
    "these observations still suffer from a lack of solid theoretical background . in order to predict observable signal from quark dijets at lhc and to make a decisive conclusion about irreducible background for higgs cep , it is worth to analyze carefully different kinematical limits both numerically and analytically .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to derive explicitly the hard subprocess amplitude @xmath11 for any quark helicity states @xmath16 and @xmath17 in diffractive kinematics in two different configurations of large @xmath18 and small @xmath19 quark transverse momenta focusing primarily on large invariant mass of @xmath20 dijets .",
    "this would give us an opportunity to analyze different kinematical asymptotics of the diffractive amplitude .",
    "having such amplitudes we can then numerically evaluate differential distributions in quark transverse momenta , rapidity , relative angle between the quark jets and invariant mass of the @xmath20 dijet .",
    "these theoretical elements are necessary for upcoming higgs searches and diffractive dijets measurements at lhc .    in the present paper",
    "we extend earlier studies related to higgs and jet production @xcite to the production of quark - antiquark jets . in our approach",
    "we use unintegrated gluon distributions as proposed by the durham group @xcite .",
    "slightly different gluon distributions , fitted to the hera data , have been used in ref .",
    "the choice of gluon distributions brings uncertainties of a factor of about 2 . in our case",
    "we consistenly use the same gluon distributions for the signal and background . in the case of higgs production",
    "we shall use off - shell matrix element for @xmath21 compared to the on - shell matrix element used before .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we consider the general kinematics of the central exclusive dijet production .",

    "[ flvertex ] : @xmath85 where by the dirac convention @xmath86 for any 4-vector @xmath87 is adopted , @xmath88 is the effective three - gluon vertex .",
    "these effective vertices were initially proposed for massless quarks in refs .",

    "indeed , by direct calculation we see that the gauge invariance over the first gluon line is satisfied : @xmath98 now due to momentum conservation @xmath99 we may rewrite the amplitude ( [ fin - vert - mn ] ) as follows @xmath100 thus , the gauge invariance over the second gluon line is also satisfied : @xmath101 comparing eqs .",
