    "<S> we report a low temperature measurement technique and magnetization data of a quantum molecular spin , by implementing an on - chip squid technique . </S>",
    "<S> this technique enables the squid magnetometery in high magnetic fields , up to 7 tesla . </S>",
    "<S> the main challenges and the calibration process are detailed . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement protocol is used to observe quantum tunneling jumps of the @xmath0 molecular magnet , mn@xmath1-tbuac . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of transverse field on the tunneling splitting for this molecular system is addressed as well .    </S>",
    "<S> _ keywords _ : squid magnetometery , on - chip devices , quantum tunneling , high magnetic field    recent investigations on molecular magnets  @xcite or less complex systems containing diluted spins  @xcite have been motivated by their quantum mechanical properties and for future implementation in quantum computing  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such studies require a large number of identical and independent magnetic cores ( often with a large spin ) , to provide a natural amplification of the fundamental quantum mechanical phenomena of a single molecule to measurable signals . </S>",
    "<S> remarkable quantum phenomena , such as the quantum tunneling of magnetization  @xcite and the berry phase quantum interference  @xcite , have been observed so far . </S>",
    "<S> sensitive magnetization measurements in sweeping magnetic fields have been performed by means of superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids )  @xcite , hall probe magnetometers  @xcite or electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr )  @xcite spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> such techniques are highly desirable to gather more information about effects such as the anisotropy - induced tunneling gap@xcite , spin states entanglements , phonon bottleneck effects  @xcite and others .    </S>",
    "<S> squid devices are well established as highly sensitive magnetic flux detectors for low temperature applications . </S>",
    "<S> a commercial squid fabricated with nb - alo@xmath2-nb josephson junctions is usually magnetically shielded and coupled to the sample through a pick - up coil  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this arrangement keeps the magnetic field from disturbing the squid . </S>",
    "<S> however , it also leads to a non - optimal coupling factor and excludes it from measuring samples of submicron size . </S>",
    "<S> a better coupling factor can be achieved by reducing the squid loop size and coupling to it directly , in the presence of a magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this represent an important advantage over hall probes , since josephson junctions can have widths of the order of the nanometer and have the sample on top or inside of it for optimal coupling . </S>",
    "<S> it is estimated that such squid implementation can detect , without extensive averaging , only few bohr magnetons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the planar tunneling junctions are not suitable because of their sensitivity to large magnetic field and relatively large dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> another type of josephson junctions ( nano - bridges )  @xcite led to a promising design in which the squid is less sensitive to a field aligned along its plane , since the critical field value of a superconducting thin film can be much higher than that of the bulk in such a case  @xcite . in this report , we present an improved on - chip squid measurement technique , in which a field up to 7  t can be aligned with high precision in the plane of a nb squid . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we have extended the observation of fundamental quantum phenomena by means of on - chip squid measurements into a higher magnetic field range , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ to a larger family of molecular magnets .    </S>",
    "<S> the technique allows real time (  on - the - fly \" ) squid magnetization measurements on samples placed in the vicinity of the squid loop , to optimize the magnetic coupling . both the sample and the squid detector </S>",
    "<S> are placed in the center of a 3-d vector magnet and thermally attached to the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator to ensure an efficient cooling .    </S>",
    "<S> the on - chip squid is made of a nb film of only 5.5  nm thickness ensuring a superconducting state even for 7  t of in - plane magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the squid loop has a 2@xmath32 @xmath4 area and contains two parallel nano - bridge josephson junctions . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the i - v characteristic of a squid is similar to a single josephson junction with flux - dependent critical current and it can be explained with the resistively and capacitively shunted junction ( rcsj ) model  @xcite . in the rcsj model , </S>",
    "<S> the phase of a squid is described by the motion equation of a ball trapped in a washboard potential . </S>",
    "<S> an increase in the squid current tilts the washboard potential , and the phase ball has a probability to escape ( and roll down along the tilted washboard ) due to both thermal activation and quantum tunneling  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the rolling of the phase ball generates a voltage across the squid and switches it from the superconducting state into the normal state . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the switching probability @xmath5 increases with the current amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> we define the switching current @xmath6 as the current corresponding to @xmath7%  @xcite . in our experiment , </S>",
    "<S> current pulses are generated by a pulsed voltage source and an in - series resistor of 15  k@xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath6 current shows a typical periodic modulation as a function of the trapped magnetic flux in the squid loop ( ( a ) ) , with a period of @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is planck s constant and @xmath11 the electron charge ) . </S>",
    "<S> the modulation amplitude is 5% , much smaller than typical values for squids with tunneling junctions but it can be used in fields up to 7  t.     modulation ( shown as the height of voltage pulses applied on squid in series with a 15 k@xmath8 resistor , such that @xmath7% ) as a function of the field generated by the feedback coil ( expressed in ma of coil current ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) same modulation as in ( a ) , obtained by fixing the applied pulse height , such that @xmath7% for the designated working point , and ramping the coil current . </S>",
    "<S> the steep slopes leads to squid s high sensitivity . ]    </S>",
    "<S> operating the squid in pulse mode , minimizes the heating generated by its switching into the normal state . </S>",
    "<S> the stochastic switching process is monitored by sending a series of current pulses of length @xmath12s to the squid and monitoring the voltage across it . </S>",
    "<S> when the squid switches into the normal state ( to a resistance of @xmath134  k@xmath8 ) , voltage pulses are generated , amplified , and counted at the readout port . </S>",
    "<S> statistically , the ratio of the counted output voltage pulses by the number of applied current pulses gives @xmath5 for that current value . </S>",
    "<S> this switching probability is modulated by the magnetic flux , as shown in ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the counting of switching events is expedited by operating the pulse mode at a high repetition frequency ( here , 50  khz ) . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism used to perform an real time measurement will now be described . as shown in ( b ) , we define the middle point in the modulation curve as the `` working point '' . during the measurement , a current pulse with a height corresponding to the working point is sent to the squid . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that the variation of the probability near the working point is very sharp , which is the key point behind the high flux sensitivity of a squid .    to lock the squid at its working point and perform a feedback measurement , we place a small superconducting coil above the squid ( see below , insert ) to actively compensate for flux changes caused by the magnetic sample . </S>",
    "<S> the feedback coil current is proportionally related to the change in the magnetic moment of the sample in an on - the - fly measurement .    </S>",
    "<S> although the principle of the measurement is relatively simple , its practical realization is quite challenging . </S>",
    "<S> the squid s thin film remains superconducting only when the high field is perfectly parallel to the plane . </S>",
    "<S> even the smallest deviation from a precise alignment , can generate unwanted normal fields leading to vortices in the thin nb film and altering the measurements . </S>",
    "<S> large deviation simply switches the squid into the normal state . also , the critical current of any superconducting material decreases with the increase of magnetic field , and so is the pulse height corresponding to the working point . </S>",
    "<S> the feedback mechanism only can be operated with a proper setting of the working point and therefore , the height of the current pulses corresponding to @xmath7% has to be carefully calibrated , as explained below .    </S>",
    "<S> the precise alignment of the magnetic field in the squid plane is done by combining fields generated by a 3-axis magnet @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> initially , the squid plane is roughly aligned along @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we only need to scan @xmath16 to fine - tune the direction of the field in the squid plane . </S>",
    "<S> the squid can only sustain a small normal field ( @xmath1315 - 20  mt ) , beyond which , the squid switches and stops working . in the calibration process , we scan @xmath16 ( chosen roughly normal to the squid plane ) for a series of given z fields , and record the field region in which the squid works ( see , triangles ) . the @xmath16 value in the middle of that region ( shown with squares in ) combined with that given @xmath15 creates a total field in the squid plane .     and @xmath17 . the required @xmath16 ( squares ) is at the middle of the region ( limited by triangles ) where the squid is not switched into the normal state by the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the linear fit leads to the misalignment angle between the holder and the coil system . </S>",
    "<S> ( insert ) maxima and minima ( triangles ) of the @xmath6 modulation as a function of @xmath15 ( as in the main plot ) . </S>",
    "<S> the working point ( squares ) is chosen at half - distance and a parabolic fit calibrates the required decrease in the excitation pulse to keep the squid ( in series with a 15 k@xmath8 resistor ) at @xmath1850% . ]    during the field alignment described above , the maximum and minimum values of @xmath5 modulation are recorded as a function of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> these values are decreasing with field increase in a parabolic manner ( see insert ) , as a consequence of the critical current decrease , mentioned above . </S>",
    "<S> the working point is calibrated at the mid - distance between the two parabolas , so that the switching probability is kept constant at 50% during squid operation .    </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate our first magnetization tunneling measurements with this high - field squid detection technique , on the mn@xmath1-tbuac crystal , a molecular magnet requiring a high field ( 5.5 t ) to reach magnetization saturation . </S>",
    "<S> a trace , starting from high negative fields ( negative saturation ) and up to @xmath195.5 t , is shown in . </S>",
    "<S> ( thick line ) . </S>",
    "<S> tunneling steps are clearly visible ( see @xcite for a similar hall - probe based measurement ) . </S>",
    "<S> also , we were able to construct a constant transverse field normal to the crystal s magnetic easy axis , while keeping the total field perfectly aligned in the squid plane during the sweep of the field in the longitudinal direction . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization curves of the sample show differences in the size of the tunneling steps ( , thin line ) . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the transverse magnetic field modifies the size of the tunneling gaps of this molecular magnet , similarly to a berry - phase process ( as in @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> -tbuac single crystal . </S>",
    "<S> the geometry is sketched in the insert : a single crystal is placed near an on - chip squid and under the feedback coil . </S>",
    "<S> the sample is first saturated at -5.5 t , and a real time measurement follows up to + 5.5 t , here at a field rate of 1 mt / s . </S>",
    "<S> the two curves shows the differences in the quantum tunneling jumps - and therefore in the tunneling splittings- for two values of the transverse field , @xmath20=0 t ( thick line ) and 0.2 t ( thin line ) respectively . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we have implemented the described feedback mechanism , simultaneously to two identical , neighboring squids . in this arrangement , </S>",
    "<S> the two squids sense similar external background field . if the studied sample is placed between the two squids , the magnetic flux lines generated by it are penetrating the squid loops in opposite directions . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a simple subtraction of two measurements can eliminate the uniform background and double the magnetic signal . </S>",
    "<S> individual runs on each ( empty ) squid show a certain wavy background signal . </S>",
    "<S> following their subtraction , which can be done in real time during a field sweep , the background is significantly flattened , suggesting that such a differential readout can further improve sensitive squid - based magnetic detection .    in conclusion , our on - chip squid detection has extended the possibility of performing magnetization studies on quantum spins into the high field regime ( up to 7 t ) . this versatile technique will allow the exploration of the quantum properties of more types of magnetic molecules . during its operation </S>",
    "<S> , the sweeping magnetic field has to be perfectly aligned in the squid plane and the excitation current pulses have to be properly calibrated with field . the magnetic detection is using the feedback information from a superconducting coil fixing the working point of the squid . </S>",
    "<S> we have also succesfully tested a differential two - squid method which significantly reduces unwanted background signals and thus improves the squid capability .    </S>",
