    "v1974 cygni ( nova cygni 1992 ) was one of the brightest galactic novae of the 20th century . at the end of february 1992",
    "it reached its maximum brightness equal to @xmath7 mag .    during subsequent years nova cygni 1992",
    "was intensively observed using several techniques .",
    "the x - ray flux of the object indicated high luminosity at the level of @xmath8 erg  s@xmath9 caused by hot material burning in thermonuclear reactions at the surface of a white dwarf ( krautter et al .",
    "1996 ) .    the earliest photometric observations obtained by deyoung and schmidt ( 1993 , 1994 ) revealed the presence of a light curve modulation with a period of 0.0813 days ( 117 min ) and an amplitude equal to 0.16 mag .",
    "in 1994 , semeniuk et al .",
    "( 1994 ) discovered another periodicity in the light curve of v1974 cygni with a period equal to 0.085 days ( 122 min ) .",
    "subsequent observations showed that this period is not stable and changes with @xmath10 at a level of  @xmath11 ( semeniuk et al .",
    "1995 , olech et al .",
    "1996 , skillman et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the 117 min stable period was interpreted as the orbital period of the system ( deyoung and schmidt 1994 , semeniuk et al .",
    "1995 , olech et al .",
    "the nature of the 122 min period still remains unexplained .",
    "until now , two major explanations have been considered : 1 ) it might be either a superhump period of a su uma permanent superhumper star ( leibowitz et al .",
    "1995 , skillman et al .",
    "1997 , retter et al .",
    "1997 ) ; or 2 ) it might be either the rotation period of the magnetized white dwarf in the binary system ( semeniuk et al .",
    "1995 , olech et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "in this paper we present the results of ccd @xmath0-band photometry of v1974 cygni performed during the end of the observational season 1996 and for the whole season of 1997 .",
    "the reported observations of v1974 cygni were obtained on nine nights during the period from october 4 , 1996 to july 15 , 1997 at the ostrowik station of the warsaw university observatory .",
    "the 60-cm cassegrain telescope , equipped with a tektronics tk512cb back illuminated ccd camera , was used .",
    "the scale of the camera was 0.76\" / pixel providing a @xmath12 field of view .",
    "the full description of the telescope and camera was given by udalski and pych ( 1992 ) .",
    "we have monitored the star in the cousins @xmath0 filter .",
    "the exposure times were 180 or 240 seconds depending on the atmospheric conditions , the seeing and the altitude of the object .",
    "a full journal of our ccd observations of v1974 cygni is given in table 1 .",
    ".journal of the ccd observations of v1974 cygni [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     our 1997 observing run , which covers over 100 cycles , is too short to derive any conclusions about the 0.085-day period changes .",
    "its mean value obtained from the @xmath1 residuals is @xmath13 day i.e. @xmath5 min which is consistent with @xmath14 min value obtained from analysis of aov power spectra .",
    "as we mentioned earlier the 0.0813-day period was stable in the years 1994 - 1997 and its value was @xmath15 min .",
    "the 0.085-day periodicity showed a more complicated behavior .",
    "it was decreasing form the middle of 1994 until the beginning of 1995 .",
    "semeniuk et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and skillman et al .",
    "( 1997 ) reported a decrease as fast as @xmath16 but our @xmath1 diagram composed from all data available in the literature indicates a much slower decrease with a rate of @xmath17 .    from the beginning of 1995",
    "the 0.085-day period started to increase and it was increasing until october 1996 .",
    "skillman et al .",
    "( 1997 ) reported an increase with a rate @xmath18 in 1996 but our @xmath1 diagram shows that the rate was not higher than @xmath19 .",
    "the most rapid change of the period was observed between october 1996 and july 1997 . in this interval",
    "the period changed from 122.67 min ( skillman et .",
    "1997 ) to 121.9 min .",
    "the @xmath10 during this period of time could be as high as @xmath20 and certainly not slower than @xmath21 .",
    "fig . 8 summarizes the results presented in this paper . it shows the evolution of both 0.085 and 0.081-day periodicities , their changes and evolution of the period of the disc precession assuming that v1974 cygni is su uma type variable ( see discussion below ) .",
    "there is consensus in the literature concerning the interpretation of the 0.0813-day signal .",
    "its discoverers , deyoung and schmidt ( 1994 ) , suggested that it can be the orbital period of the binary system containing a white dwarf and a small main sequence star . the following papers by semeniuk at al .",
    "( 1995 ) , leibowitz et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , olech et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , skillman et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and retter et al .",
    "( 1997 ) confirmed this conclusion .",
    "our investigation also confirmed the previous results . as was shown by semeniuk et al .",
    "( 1995 ) the value of the orbital period in 1993 was 0.0812623 days .",
    "in the first part of 1994 the period decreased by 0.4 seconds as was interpreted as a possible mass loss from the binary system .",
    "we have shown that in the years 1994 - 1997 the 0.085-day period was stable and its exact value was equal to @xmath22 days ( @xmath15 min ) supporting the hypothesis that it is indeed the orbital period of the binary system .",
    "on the other hand there are two possible interpretations of the longer 0.085-day period .",
    "semeniuk et al .",
    "( 1994 ) who discovered it , suggested that it can be the rotation period of the white dwarf .",
    "according to that paper the evolution of the v1974 cygni resembled the behavior of intermediate polars and particularly the famous nova v1500 cygni . prior to the nova explosion , v1974 cygni was a magnetized , synchronously rotating am her type binary . during outburst",
    "the spin / orbit synchronism was broken and the 0.085-day period , decreasing in 1994 , may be the spin period of the white dwarf now evolving into synchronism with the orbital cycle . according to semeniuk et al .",
    "( 1995 ) the predicted time scale for equalization of both periods was @xmath23 yr .    observations from 1995 analyzed by olech et al .",
    "( 1996 ) showed , however , that the 0.085-day period stopped to decrease and since the middle of july 1995 seems to be increasing .",
    "olech et al .",
    "( 1996 ) pointed out that changes of the time derivative of spin periods are known in intermediate polars .",
    "fo aqr is a good example of such objects ( osborne and mukai 1989 , kruszewski and semeniuk 1993 ) .",
    "an additional argument for the spin nature of the 0.085-day period given by olech et al .",
    "( 1996 ) was a characteristic shape of the 1995 light curve of v1974 cygni .",
    "a distinct feature of these light curves was a double structure of the maxima which is often observed in polars , possibly due to the existence of two magnetic poles ( e.g. am her itself , olson 1997 )    another explanation of the 0.085-day periodicity assumes that it might be the superhump period of a su uma type star ( leibowitz et al .",
    "1995 , skillman et al .",
    "1997 , retter et al .",
    "su uma stars are non - magnetized dwarf novae showing outbursts on a time scale of days and weeks and superoutbursts on a time scale of months . during the superoutburst",
    "a tidal instability causes the precession of the accretion disc .",
    "the presence of both precession and orbital periods causes the appearance of the third , so - called superhump period which is a few percent longer than the orbital period . in this interpretation",
    "v1974 cygni is not a typical su uma star but rather a member of a newly discovered subgroup of these variables called permanent superhumpers ( skillman and patterson 1993 ) .",
    "these systems are characterized by mass transfer rates as high as @xmath24 g  s@xmath9 ( osaki 1996 ) and thus are understood as nova - like stars below the period gap that are thermally stable but tidally unstable , i.e. being in permanent superoutburst .    assuming that v1974 cyg is a permanent superhumper we can directly compute its period of the disc precession which is a beat period between orbital and superhump periods .",
    "the behavior of the precession period in the years 1994 - 1997 is shown in lower panel of fig .",
    "such rapid changes of the accretion disc are consistent with recent models of su uma systems ( see for example kornet and ryczka 2000 or buat - menart and hameury 2002 )    about ten years ago the diversity of behavior observed in cataclysmic variables seemed to be quite small .",
    "these variables were classified into few distinct groups which were clearly visible in the @xmath25 diagram ( see for example fig .",
    "3 of osaki 1996 ) .",
    "there was a group of su uma stars below the period gap and at longer orbital periods one can find three other groups of u gem , z cam and nova - like stars , listed according to the increasing @xmath26 .    in the mid-1990s the situation started to become more complicated .",
    "the su uma group itself was divided into several subgroups as er uma stars ( kato and kunjaya 1995 ) and wz sge stars ( pych and olech 1995 , kato et al . 1996 )",
    ". additionally nogami et al .",
    "( 1998a , 1998b ) and uemura et al .",
    "( 2001 ) discovered the first dwarf novae in the middle of the period gap .",
    "the stars with short orbital periods and high accretion rates were found to be permanent superhumper systems ( skillman and patterson 1993 ) .",
    "superhump - like variations were also detected in ultra - short orbital period systems containing helium secondary ( e.g. am cvn , v485 cen , hp lib or 1rxs j232953.9 + 062814 - skillman et al .",
    "1999 , olech 1997 , patterson et al .",
    "2002 , skillman et al . 2002 ) and possibly a black hole primary ( e.g. kv uma , uemura et al . 2002 )    permanent superhumps were also thought to be the reason for periodic light variations in other high accretion binaries on both sides of the period gap . at longer periods positive and negative superhumps were detected in nova - like variables ( for example v592 cas and v751 cyg - taylor et al .",
    "1998 , patterson et al . 2001 ) .",
    "finally , permanent superhumps were assumed as the main cause of short period variations of the light curves of classical nova systems lying on both sides of the periodic gap ( e.g. v603 aql , cp pup and v1974 cyg itself - thomas 1993 , patterson and warner 1998 , retter and leibowitz 1998 ) .",
    "retter and leibowitz ( 1998 ) found that these three classical novae are characterized by high accretion rates ( @xmath26 from @xmath27 to @xmath28 g  s@xmath9 ) and thus their periodic variations could be interpreted as permanent superhumps .",
    "the most interesting case is v1974 cygni itself . according to retter and leibowitz ( 1998 )",
    ", it should undergo transition from a permanent superhumper to the ordinary su uma star around the year 2000 ( with an uncertainty of about 2 years ) .",
    "to summarize , the latest results obtained for several cataclysmic variables strongly supports the hypothesis that 122-min periodicity observed in the light curve of v1974 cygni is a superhump period .",
    "the period changes and the changes of the period derivative are known in both su uma stars and polars .",
    "but the temporal evolution of the 122-min period especially in 1996 - 1997 was quite rapid .",
    "such rapid changes of the period ( sometimes as high as @xmath10 around @xmath29 ) arising from changes in the behavior of the accretion disc are observed in su uma systems . on the other hand",
    "the @xmath30 min change of the 122-min periodicity which occurred between 1996 and 1997 would be problematic from the point of view of the hypothesis assuming that we observe the rotation period of a magnetized white dwarf .",
    "such a rapid change would require a change in the rotational kinetic energy of the white dwarf as large as @xmath31 ergs .",
    "this argument was also given by skillman et al .",
    "( 1997 ) based on the period changes of v1974 cygni in 1995 - 1996 . in our work , however , we showed that these changes were not as abrupt as was previously thought , thus the change of the rotational energy was not so large . in the end of 1996",
    "the 122-min period started to decrease more rapidly and thus we again should expect a change of the rotational energy at the level of @xmath31 ergs which is higher than the entire energy radiated by the star in the october 1996 - july 1997 interval .",
    "finally , we conclude that the explanation of the 122-min periodicity involving the permanent superhumps phenomenon is more consistent with observations than assumption that we are observing the rotation of a white dwarf . however , the beginning of the new millennium is the ideal time for checking both hypotheses .",
    "the lack of the 122-min periodicity in the present light curve of nova cygni 1992 would support the superhump explanation indicating that the object became an ordinary su uma star and the presence of this period in circular polarization would validate the connection of the period with white dwarf rotation .    * acknowledgments . * we would like to thank to prof . jzef smak and chris oconnor for reading and commenting on the manuscript .",
