    "in classical physics the brownian motion is the erratic motion of microscopic particles due to non - zero value of net stocastic forces at any given time exerted on them by atoms or moleculs of the surrounding medium .",
    "such microscopic particles do nt play active role in the motion and their irreversible dissipation of energy is compensated by reversible thermal fluctuations as expressed in the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "in contrast , if the particles have internal or external energy source leading to self - propulsion , their motion will have directional biasness .",
    "such motion is reffered to as the _ active _ brownian motion .",
    "some example subjects of active brownian motion relevant to our study are self - driven colloidal particles , living microorganisms , and vibrated _ janus _ particles  @xcite .",
    "these systems exhibit many interesting nonequilibrium effects understanding of which have been the research focus of many scientists in recent years .    in this context , a phenomenological model of active brownian motion has been developed based on principle of energy take up , store and dissipation into kinetic degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "other research team , j. r. howse _ et al . _ , experimentally studied active brownian motion of spherical polystyrene particles that are self - propelled due to asymmetric surface activity  @xcite .",
    "they interpreted the data using an expression for the mean - squared displacement that takes into account rotational diffusion of the self - propulsion velocity .",
    "more recently motion of deformable self - propelled particles analytically has been studied assuming that the particles can deform from circular shape when the propagation velocity is increased  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that such a particle undergo a bifurcation from straight motion to a circular motion by increasing the propagation velocity .",
    "also , brownian dynamics of a microswimmer composed of three spheres which propels itself in a viscous fluid by spinning motion of the spheres under zero net torque has been studied  @xcite .",
    "finally , in ref  @xcite dynamics of a brownian circle swimmer has been studied when the driving force does not coincide with the propagation direction .",
    "it was hypothesized that when the self - propulsion force and the particle orientation are in line , the motion would be along a straight line just perturbed by random fluctuations .    in this paper , we present detailed study of the active brownian motion of an asymmetric particle when the self - propulsion force and the particle orientation are in line . unlike previous studies our approach takes into account the particle asymmetry .",
    "collective behavior of such rods , which interact with each other through excluded volume , has been theoretically studied  @xcite and it was shown that the self - propulsion enhances the longitudinal diffusion coefficient . our calculations",
    ", however , show that in the case of one rod both the longitudinal and the transverse diffusion coefficients are enhanced and assume the same value at long times .    the paper is organized as following : after introducing the model , we start by calculating the mean squared displacements and corresponding diffusion tensors for two cases : when a rod is self - propelled at constant speed and when such a self - propelled rod is in external constant potential field . the paper is concluded by the disucssion of the results .",
    "the model consists of an ellipsoidal rigid particle that is self - propelled along its long axis and undergoing brownian motion in two dimensions  ( see fig .",

    "the rotational noise @xmath17 is a gaussian random variable with zero mean and variance [ 4 ] _",

    "the ensemble average is calculated using @xmath22 where @xmath23 indicates average both over @xmath24 and @xmath25 at a fixed initial angle .",
    "the self - propulsion force does nt induce torque , which in turn enables the rod to rotate freely about the axis passing through its center of mass and perpendicular to the plane of motion .",
    "this means that the angular displacements obey the gaussian statistics with constant rotational diffusion coefficient . in the lab - frame",
    "the shape asymmetry of the rod makes the translational and rotational displacements coupled , which complicates the analytic examination of the motion .",
    "the gaussianity of the angular displacements , however , simplifies the matter and leads to detailed analytic results .",
    "as we mentioned previously , to carry out the calculations analytically we shall set @xmath26 .",

    "yields a time - dependent displacement diffusion tensor , [ 13 ] d_ij(t)=_0 ^ 2d_0d_ij(t,_0)=[d_s-_r v^2]_ij .",
    "this shows that the system of non - interacting self - propelled rods is no longer diffusive as the displacement diffusion tensor is time dependent .",
    "however , in all cases the time dependence becomes negligible for @xmath38 , and as @xmath0 tends to infinity unlike the _ passive _ ellipsoidal rigid particle case , for the self - propelled ellipsoid the single long - time diffusion coefficient is enhanced according to [ 14 ] d_ij(t)d_s_ij .    when @xmath38 the directional memory is lost and the rod behaves as a perfect spherical brownian particle with enhanced diffusion coefficient .",

    "in the previous section we studied the active brownian motion of a rigid rod in the absence of external field and torque . here",
    "we discuss the motion under the infulance of external constant force . as in the previous case",
    "we assume the rod is constrained to move in a plane .",
    "an example of such a system may be active colloidal suspension of asymmetric particles under gravity .    without loosing any generality , we can always rotate the coordinate system ( lab - frame ) such that the external force is along the @xmath3 axis , @xmath42 . then using eq .   from eq",
    ".   we can write [ 15 ] x(t)=ft+f_0^t2dt + + _ 0^t_xdt+v_0^tdt,[16 ] y(t)=f_0^t2dt+_0^t_ydt+v_0^tdt,with averages given by [ 17 ] x__0=ft+v_1_0+f_42_0 , + y__0=v_1_0+f_42_0 .",

    "_ * self - propulsion vs. external potential field - * _ we saw that for the self - propelled particle the long time single diffusion coefficient is enhanced according to @xmath36 .",
    "this enhancement is similar to that of a non self - propelled ellipsoid due to external constant potential field ( @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the force magnitude of the external potential field  @xcite  ) since both of them are proportional to the square of the force magnitude .",
    "however , the latter explicitly depends on the asymmetry of the particle , @xmath46 , but the former does not . the origin of this discrepancy may be apparent from the fact that our model assumes that in addition to the external constant force the rod has a fixed speed @xmath47 directed along its long axis at all times while the former model assumes the rod feels only an external constant force @xmath6 at all times . therefore similar to the hydrodynamic drag force",
    ", the external potential field brings in the friction factor between the two situations .",
    "also , a clear difference between the two situations is easily understood by neglecting the noise and hence considering a deterministic description .",
    "then one can immediately calculate the velocity and displacement in the lab frame as functions of time and the initial angle , @xmath37 , for given initial conditions . in the absence of external potential field we have zero mean displacement and zero velocity when averaging over @xmath37 .",
    "however , in the presence of external potential field one obtains a mean velocity @xmath48 in the @xmath3 direction and @xmath49 in the @xmath43 direction with corresponding mean displacements .",
    "in writing down the  eqs .   and   we have dropped the inertial terms assuming the motion is overdamped , that is , the viscous terms dominate the inertial ones .",
    "if we had kept those terms , they would have generated homogenous part of the solutions which exponentially decay with the characteristic _ relaxation times _ , @xmath50 for translational and @xmath51 for rotational motion . here",
    "@xmath52 is the mass and @xmath53 is the moment of inertia about the @xmath54 axis passing through the center of mass of the rod .",
    "our results are , therefore , not valid in time intervals comparable to the relaxation times given the fact that recently developed experimentation technics , namely , use of the photonic force microscopy allows high precision measurements in such small time intervals  @xcite .    _",
    "* mean displacement - * _ eq .   has limiting forms of @xmath55 for @xmath38 suggesting that at very long times the self - propelled rod must behave as a spherical brownian particle in the region centered @xmath56 far from its initial position and @xmath57 for @xmath39 .",
    "the latter is intuitive since at early times the motion is anisotropic which is not the case for the long time result . to give a full physical meaning to these results",
    ", we contrast the cases when the self - propulsion ( sp ) is ` turned on ' and ` off ' .",
    "first thing to note about these two situations is that both of them have the same rotational time , @xmath58 , since the net torque is zero in both cases . using this",
    ", we can picture what the rod would do before and after the crossover has occurred when the sp is on and when it is off : ( i ) before the crossover ( @xmath59 ) , short time anisotropy gets contribution from sp which causes the rod move faster in a particluar direction than when sp is turned off .",
    "therefore in the anisotropic regime the rod displaces more due to sp than when sp is turned off , ( ii ) after the crossover has occurred ( @xmath60 ) , in both cases the rod starts performing isotropic diffusion about the position that it has arrived during the time while @xmath61 .",
    "therefore @xmath56 is the mean distance between the _ centers of isotropic diffusion _ domains of non self - propelled and self - propelled rods .",
    "note that if we average over the initial orientation , components of the mean displacement are zero and so is the mean displacement .",
    "this is not in contradiction with what we have above .",
    "averaging over the initial angle is equivalent to averaging over the number of non - interacting self - propelled rods that started up from the same point in isotropic manner . at long times ,",
    "the centers of isotropic diffusion for these rods are distributed isotropically about the starting point and hence have zero mean displacement . from this point of view",
    ", we average the diffusion tensor over the initial orientation to analyze transient behavior of diffusion in the system of non - interacting such rods .",
    "a particle undergoing classical brownian motion takes the same amount of time for going from a given initial point to a final point and coming back . for our model",
    "this is not the case : the domain of isotropic motion is centered @xmath56 far from an arbitrary starting point implying that a particle would need more time ( equivalently less probability ) for coming back .",
    "in fact , it has been observed that when the _ pigment granules _ are spreading out from nucleus of the cell , they go straight through _ actin filament _ intersections until they get to the end of the filament , but if they need to return to the nucleus , _ cargos _ often switch at actin filament intersections hence taking relatively longer time to come back  @xcite .",
    "this is in accordance with the prediction of the model presented here .",
    "_ * mean - squared displacement - * _ in eq .",
    "the second term is exactly the same as the one in refs  @xcite obtained for the _ persistent random walk _",
    "@xcite with persistence time @xmath62 and the weak noise limit of the expression obtained from a model of brownian particles which are pumped with energy by means of a non - linear friction function ( upon setting @xmath63 ) in refs  @xcite , while the first term is the contribution due to _ classical brownian motion_. this is similar to that of the levy - walk superdiffusive motion which can be decomposed into thermal orientation fluctuations and an active motion of the rods with a constant velocity along their long axis  @xcite .",
    "it is known that at short times the cell appears to persist at the direction of motion but at long times the pattern of movement is similar to the classical brownian motion  @xcite .",
    "because of this , the persistent random walk model have been used to quantify cell migrations  @xcite .",
    "the results presented here suggest that by including contribution due to the classical brownian motion as in eq .",
    "one can describe individual cell movements on a plane substrate more accurately than it has been using the persistent random walk model .",
    "recently , an experiment has been carried out by jonathan r. howse , _",
    "et al_. who studied the motion of polystyrene spheres with a diameter of 1.62 @xmath64 m immersed in hydrogen peroxide and half - coated with platinum  @xcite . due to the local osmotic pressure gradient created by the asymmetric chemical reaction such spheres were propelled .",
    "they were able to fit the experimental data only with the short- and long - time limits of the expression for their model , which is the same as eq .   if we replace @xmath58 with @xmath65 .",
    "but if we consider the displacement components along the @xmath3 and @xmath43 axes separately , then immediately we see a major difference between these two cases which has been hidden in the expressions for the mean - squared displacements .",
    "the first model consists of a self - propelled sphere whose direction of motion is subject to diffusion and hence no expression could contain shape asymmetry as it is zero .",
    "in contrast , our model contains shape asymmetry , @xmath66 , which makes it distinct from any previously studied model when considering the @xmath3 and @xmath43 components of quantities of our interest , such as the mean - squared displacement .",
