    "2 ( d ) is the stable domain structure calculated with the model starting with the domain structure from 2 ( a ) .",

    "starting from fig .  2 ( d ) and gradually increasing the applied field , and letting the system evolve using eq .  [ dimensionless ] to a stable domain structure results in figs .  2 ( e ) and ( f ) .",
    "the shape of the simulated domains matches the experimental one , and a high level of detail is reproduced by our model , although some discrepancies are apparent .",
    "we then simulate a magnetometry measurement at 10k after cooling in a 1 t field , that is , a typical exchange - bias measurement , fig .  2 ( i ) .",
    "this we do using exactly the same values of @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath46 employed for the above domain evolution .",
    "however , we can not use exactly the same distribution of pinned ucs as before , since it is set by the f s magnetization structure during cooling , which is now different .",
    "neither can we directly measure the pinned ucs from this experiment preparation@xcite : recall that a uniformly magnetized f film would produce no stray field for the mfm to detect , so in the field cooled case the mfm would only image the inhomogeneity of the pinned ucs on a local scale , but not their average density . but note that the f , over the areas inside its domains , sets the pinned ucs in the same way as an f saturated with the appropriate orientation would .",
    "thus for the loop simulation we construct the map of pinned ucs shown in fig.[fig : modelvalidation](h ) from the one obtained after zero - field cooling , shown in fig.[fig : modelvalidation](g ) by inverting the pucs under the white ferromagnetic domains .",
    "the important loop characteristics agree well with experiment . specifically , we observe a mean coercivity of 86.20mt and an exchange field of 12.35mt in the field - cooled case , which compare well with experiment ( 77.7mt and 13.6mt , respectively ) .",
    "prominent features of the magnetization loop , such as the knee at the nucleation field and the subsequent more protracted approach to saturation are also displayed by the model results for the hysteresis . in the zero field cooled case , where we expect no macroscopic exchange bias , we obtain a match of comparable quality as for the field - cooled case . for the corresponding comparison at 300k , also in fig .  2 ( i )",

    "+ next , we can set @xmath66 to simulate a film with double the average density of @xmath56 and with the same inhomogeneity .",
    "in other words , a film with greater average @xmath31 but comparable levels of coupling frustration and local variations in the pinning ability of the af .",
    "the resulting hysteresis curve is laterally shifted by an amount twice as large as @xmath30 in the first simulation , confirming the experimental results based on microscopic domain pattern evolution .",
    "notably the enlarged coercivity , which typically accompanies exchange - bias , remains at the original levels .",
    "+ these findings change if , conversely , we set @xmath67 to simulate a film with the original average density of @xmath31 but twice the amplitude of the inhomogeneity . in that case the model results in a greater coercivity without significant changes in the exchange - bias .",
    "from figure 3 we can see that simulations without anisotropy inhomogeneity or without pinned uncompensated af spins can not match the experimental domains as accurately as the full simulation with @xmath57 and @xmath52 , figs .",
    "2(d)(f ) .",
    "despite such deficiencies , the simulation with @xmath54 tracks the experiment with reasonable accuracy for 0 and 100mt applied field , and shows more prominent deviations from it only at 200mt .",
    "this high field behavior is compatible with the smaller number of energy minima of sufficient strength in the absence of coupling to the af .",
    "+ as a means to control domain boundary motion @xmath55 appear to be slightly less effective than @xmath68 inhomogeneity , which agrees with @xmath69 .",
    "in particular , figs .",
    "( f ) depart markedly from the other simulations already at 0mt applied field .",
    "furthermore at 200mt the simulation would predict magnetization saturation , so , clearly , pinning from @xmath55 alone is unable to describe the measured domain structure at 200mt .",
    "these observations do not imply a subordinate role of @xmath31 in exchange - bias ; on the contrary .",
    "they show that even without anisotropy inhomogeneity to pin the f domain walls a magnetization structure is retained up until at least 100mt , which would not be possible if @xmath31 did not pin the domains .",
    "+ moreover , the discrepancies between model and experiment depend significantly on the local values @xmath25 , the distribution of which we have carefully kept in the most generic form . because of that , @xmath25 very likely differs from the real distribution of @xmath68 , and simulation inaccuracies are to be expected .",
    "nevertheless , the model captures the essential physics of the magnetization reversal in the presence of domain wall motion .",
    "an anisotropy distribution with a sufficiently large number of free parameters could of course be adjusted so as to yield a more perfect match between model and experiment .",
    "however , this strategy would obscure , rather than clarify the magnetization reversal mechanism here .",
    "+ we can gain additional insight into how the reversal is affected by the @xmath31 and @xmath68 distributions when we look at simulations of the magnetization loops .",
    "for instance , we can reexamine the link between exchange - bias and average @xmath31 found in microscopic observations@xcite .",
    "hysteresis loops at 10k are the macroscopic counterpart to these observations , which could not have been carried out in experiment due to the impossibility of arbitrarily changing the density of pinned uncompensated spins .",
    "+ table [ table1 ] confirms that exchange - bias is roughly proportional to the average density of pinned uncompensated spins .",
    "in particular , pinned uncompensated af spins aligned parallel to the f are detrimental to exchange bias .",
    "moreover , the inhomogeneity of the @xmath31 leads to an excess coercivity .",
    "the importance of this finding is that rotating ucs and irreversible processes in the af are not a necessary condition for excess coercivity , as the prevalent thinking holds@xcite . nor",
    "is their role in f reversal at low temperature expected to be major , except perhaps in the case of strongly coupled@xcite f - af layers .",
    "+ the picture that emerges is one where the inhomogeneity of the f s anisotropy and of the af s pinned uncompensated spins largely determines the details of the f reversal . from our data@xcite as well as from xmcd measurements@xcite",
    "it is clear that the pinned uncompensated spins exist in exchange bias systems in relatively high areal densities , exceeding @xmath7010% of a monolayer .",
    "this is in apparent contradiction to the observed exchange fields , which are far smaller than would be expected if all pinned ucs coupled with bulk - order exchange constants to the f ( note that by measuring",
    "_ pinned _ ucs we consider only the part that is stable in applied fields ) .",
    "the problem stems from the default assumption that all pinned ucs participate in the coupling to the f. notice though , that the pinned ucs found in the aforementioned experiments align antiparallel to the f moments .",
    "consequently they can not be aligned directly by the cooling field . instead",
    ", these pinned ucs must be exchange - coupled to the f ( antiferromagnetically , possibly via a superexchange mechanism ) , or otherwise exchange - coupled to such ucs . in either case it follows that these pinned ucs must be located at or near the f - af interface .",
    "but of them , only the ones that couple directly ( antiferromagnetically , as discussed ) to the f generate an exchange bias effect .",
    "the remaining ones do not provide additional coupling , explaining the weakness of the exchange bias in the presence of a surprisingly high density of pinned ucs .",
    "our conclusion is supported by reflectometry experiments that revealed the pinned ucs existed over a film thickness larger than the roughness of the interface@xcite . hence models assuming a sharp interface or uncompensated spins located solely at an atomically sharp interface between an f and af seem inappropriate to explain exchange bias . +",
    "thus our 2d phase - field model of exchange - bias systems based on general assumptions and parameters set by experiment , matches experiment in macroscopic and microscopic detail , and on this basis is able to establish that : 1 ) the magnitude of the average @xmath31 density determines the exchange - bias field @xmath30 in spite of the fact that only a part of these @xmath31 couple directly to the f. 2 ) the spatial inhomogeneity of the @xmath31 governs the evolution of the domain pattern on a local scale and gives rise to excess coercivity associated with exchange bias .",
    "3 ) irreversible af processes and @xmath31 rotation need not be invoked to explain excess coercivity .",
    "4 ) the average coupling between the f moments and the @xmath31 is weak compared to intrinsic coupling constants describing the exchange in ferromagnets and antiferromagnets .",
    "it is important to discuss the extent of the adjustments admitted in the course of matching the model results to experiment ( see supplementary information for a table of material parameters and adjustment guidelines ) .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath46 are not arbitrary ( `` free '' ) .",
    "specifically , @xmath13 and @xmath21 are precisely known for the particular film we used@xcite . with regard to @xmath48 , because @xmath71 is not available for our film the model calculations are carried out using a literature value@xcite subject to fine adjustments of few % . this is acceptable given @xmath68 may differ slightly for two films of the same nominal characteristics and fabrication process .",
    "we restrict the rms inhomogeneity of @xmath68 to not more than about 20% , effectively limiting the range of possible values of @xmath46 to small positive numbers of order @xmath72 . determining @xmath49",
    "further requires specifying @xmath26 .",
    "we use bulk values found in literature@xcite and apply corrections for the different dimensionality of our model , as called for by data on the domain wall width @xmath73 in our system@xcite and the relation @xmath74 for bloch - walls .",
    "the values @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , used for the first model calculation on the basis of which further adjustments follow , are determined in this way .",

    "<S> however , the use of these parameters , notably the coupling strength between the systems ferromagnetic ( f ) and antiferromagnetic ( af ) layers , obscures conclusions about their influence on the magnetization reversal processes . </S>",
    "<S> here we develop a 2d phase - field model of the magnetization process in exchange - biased @xmath0 that incorporates the 10nm - resolved measured local biasing characteristics of the antiferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> just three interrelated parameters set to measured physical quantities of the ferromagnet and the measured density of uncompensated spins thus suffice to match the experiment in microscopic and macroscopic detail . </S>",
    "<S> we use the model to study changes in bias and coercivity caused by different distributions of pinned uncompensated spins of the antiferromagnet , in application - relevant situations where domain wall motion dominates the ferromagnetic reversal . </S>",
    "<S> we show the excess coercivity can arise solely from inhomogeneity in the density of biasing- and anti - biasing pinned uncompensated spins in the antiferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> counter to conventional wisdom , irreversible processes in the latter are not essential .    in coupled ferromagnetic- ( `` f '' ) and antiferromagnetic ( `` af '' ) thin films exchange - bias can arise for fixed af magnetic structures@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effect , widely used in contemporary magnetic devices such as giant- and tunnel - magnetoresistive thin - film sensors@xcite , is set up when the f structure `` imprints '' a stabilizing structure in the af upon cooling below the af nel temperature . </S>",
    "<S> it is manifested primarily as a lateral shift of the hysteresis loop of the f layer@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> often the width of the loop also increases with the onset of exchange - bias ( e.g.  @xcite ) , recently prompting studies of the use of this excess coercivity as a proxy for the degree of sub - monolayer co - oxidation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + microscopic model views of afs and f - af interfaces have provided insight into the mechanisms by which these features arise at the smallest scales@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that one characteristic of the materials systems associated with exchange bias is the existence of pinned uncompensated spins antiparallel to the f - magnetization@xcite for co , fe or permalloy coupled to coo . </S>",
    "<S> the excess coercivity , on the other hand , has been circumscribed in the models to the effects of irreversible processes in the af@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> understanding these phenomena at scales that reveal domain wall motion in polycrystalline films is important because many ( if not most ) applications rely on magnetization reversal through this process  or their impediment@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence the relevance of work by fujiwara et al .  </S>",
    "<S> and stiles et al.@xcite that studied the influence of distributions of af crystallite orientations and anisotropy in exchange bias </S>",
    "<S> . however , in these studies the evolution of domain walls in the f during reversal could not be accounted for because of the exceedingly high computational cost of modelling macroscopic systems . </S>",
    "<S> other works have recently overcome this limitation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but the role of the af / f coupling , which is perhaps the least well understood component of exchange bias , is obscured by the reliance on free parameters for its description , and by the large variety of experimental results .    with this work </S>",
    "<S> our goal is to _ avoid _ free parameters in a model description of f reversal processes in typical exchange bias systems . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we want to rely exclusively on measured ( or literature ) values for the samples described , and show how accurate a model description can be , as assessed from measured microscopic domain images in applied fields and from hysteresis loops . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the dispersion in the measured sample data used as model input must be small  hence we studied a single sample . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , on the contentious issue of the distribution of pinned uncompensated spins , we can use 10nm - resolved experimental data from schmid et al.@xcite . as for the coupling </S>",
    "<S> , its average can be deduced from magnetometry of the exchange - bias field @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> various statistics of the anisotropy of the af on a granular scale can be accessed with techniques such as that proposed by vallejo fernandez et al.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this information would be essential for a correct account of temperature dependent- and training phenomena , and lacking it , we do not attempt to describe these effects ( incorporating them would be possible , but beyond the scope of this work ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial distribution of f and af anisotropy on the other hand can not easily be furnished by experiment . so as not to shape the model outcome with our particular choice of distribution , we select the most general distribution possible , a gaussian one . </S>",
    "<S> improved models would base the anisotropy distributions on statistics of measured barkhausen avalanches in the sample@xcite , or infer spatial distributions from the marginal changes of domain boundaries with applied field at room temperature , where there is no exchange bias .    </S>",
    "<S> our model is a 2d phase - field model , similar to those used to describe ferromagnetic films in relation to the role of disorder in domain dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , return point memory effects  @xcite , barkhausen avalanche distributions  @xcite , and the role of defects in the domain reorientation under the influence of an oscillating external field  @xcite have been investigated in this fashion . </S>",
    "<S> these studies did not attempt to match experiment quantitatively , in part because the local domain pinning strength was not known ; nor have they been implemented in the context of exchange - bias . from this perspective , our model differs from conventional ones in three important ways : first , it describes an exchange - bias system on a scale relevant for magnetization reversal processes governed by domain wall motion . </S>",
    "<S> second , it incorporates an experimentally determined@xcite 10nm - resolved distribution of f - af pinned uncompensated spins ( @xmath2 ) over the @xmath3m@xmath4 m area modelled . </S>",
    "<S> as we will show in the following , the inhomogeneity of pinned ucs affects @xmath1 and @xmath5@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence the importance of using experimental values for pinned ucs , and the implied refinement over previous models . and </S>",
    "<S> third , the model agrees quantitatively with the experimentally determined hysteresis loop and 10nm - resolved domain evolution , using for both scales one and the same set of material parameters that are in agreement with commonly accepted experimental values . </S>"
