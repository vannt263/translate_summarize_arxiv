    "several approaches have been pursued in the theoretical elucidation of this problem @xcite .",
    "the main difference between previous approaches and the one advocated here is that we start with a consistent free energy of the polymer - solvent mixture that allows us to formulate the thermodynamic equilibrium for the pore - external solution system in terms of the chemical potential of the polymer species as well as the chemical potential ( osmotic pressure ) of the solvent .",

    "we will first analyze the osmotic pressure of this solution for various amounts of speg added to the background of bpeg .",
    "then we assume that this solution is in equilibrium with a pore that can be penetrated by the speg at a finite free energy price but is impenetrable to bpeg .",
    "we calculate the corresponding partition coefficient and assess the pushing forces exerted by the external polymer solution _ via _ its osmotic pressure .",

    "for a mixed peg solution in equilibrium with a pore that is permeable only to one component of the peg mixture ( _ e.g. _ speg ) but impermeable to the other one ( bpeg ) , the short peg chain has to be in chemical equilibrium between the solution and the pore @xcite .",
    "this signifies that the chemical potential of speg chain inside the pore and in the external solution must be the same .",
    "thus it makes sense to define the _ partition coefficient _ of the peg type that can penetrate the pore as a ratio between the concentration inside the pore and outside in the external solution .",
    "we first derive the chemical potential for the two peg components of the solution as well as for water . for polymer @xmath38 or @xmath39 @xmath40 where , again",

    "it is easy to show that the chemical potentials derived above satisfy the gibbs - duhem relation .",
    "we will now calculate the partition coefficient for small polymers in solution assuming that they can penetrate the pore , schematically depicted in fig . [ schematic ] .",
    "assume first a polymer solution composed of only small ( s ) polymers and that speg can enter the pore with a free energy penalty @xmath42 .",
    "for the time being we surmise that this free energy difference does not depend on the state of the polymer in the pore and is independent of the polymer concentration inside the pore , depending only on the single chain confinement free energy .",
    "for the magnitude of @xmath42 , we use the standard argument @xcite based on the fact that the polymer needs to be squeezed into a pore whose diameter is smaller than the `` natural '' flory radius of the chain . with this in mind we obtain@xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the monomer size and where we assume that the length of the polymer that penetrates the pore is equal to the full length of polymer , @xmath15 . in what follows we will simply take the value of @xmath42 to be independent of @xmath45 and do not specify its exact form .",
    "the latter indeed depends not only on the pore radius but also on the polymer - pore surface interaction energy , for details see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "then if @xmath46 stands for the inside the pore and @xmath47 for the outside , the chemical equilibrium is established when @xmath48 also , since the solvent is in chemical equilibrium too , we need an additional equation @xmath49 in principle at least , for the solvent too we could add a separate pore penetration energy .",

    "we generalized the equation of state for a single type of polymer to the case of a simple binary polymer mixture , composed of two types of polymer chains , `` s '' and `` b '' , of which only the former can enter the pore with a finite free energy price .",
    "we then used this equation of state in order to formulate the equilibrium distribution of the short polymer between the external solution and the pore , obtaining the partition coefficient of the short chains in terms of the external polymer solution composition .",
    "our analysis reduces to the known cases when there is only a single type of polymer in solution .",
    "the partitioning of a single component of the polymer solution into a pore can be described with the concept of `` polymers pushing polymers '' : the non - penetrating polymer chains `` b '' contribute an osmotic push for an enhanced partitioning of the `` s '' polymer chains into the pore .",
    "we find that the larger the concentration of the non - penetrating `` b '' polymer in the external solution , the larger the concentration of penetrating polymer `` s '' that will be pushed into the pore at any value of the pore penetration energy . however , this does not imply that the partitioning _ coefficient _ , _",
    "i.e. _ , the ratio of the `` s '' concentration inside and outside the pore , is always a monotonic function of the external concentrations of both polymer types .    analysing the general properties of the partition coefficient when the `` s '' and the `` b '' components of the external polymer mixture are allowed to vary independently , we find that the general features of the pore penetration are governed by two different penetration free energy scales , @xmath119 and @xmath112 .",
    "the former differentiates between enhanced partitioning , @xmath99 , and ordinary partitioning @xmath121 dependent on the osmotic pushing strength of the external polymer mixture and indeed embodies the concept of `` polymers pushing polymers '' .",

    "while @xmath122 is a monotonic function of its arguments , @xmath110 is not .",
    "the latter type of behaviour is understood as stemming from the interplay between the polymer mixing entropy and/or configurational fluctuations in the external binary polymer solution , and the pore penetration penalty .",
    "both of these free energy scales depend on the composition of the external solution and for a fixed @xmath42 one should be able to control the partitioning of a polymer into a pore , or in general into any nano - cavity , by varying the composition of the external polymer mixture .",
    "this principle should have applications in many areas of nano - science dealing with partitioning of polymer chains into small enclosures .",
    "experiments are under way to test at least some of the conclusions reached on the basis of the theory presented here @xcite .",
    "while we have analyzed only the most simple case of a binary polymer mixture , one can in principle generalize this theory to more complex polydispersity .",
    "this would entail the introduction of a size distribution in the equation of state as well as an energy size distribution for the pore penetration penalty .",
    "one could formulate the corresponding expressions for equilibrium partitioning in a parallel fashion to what we derived for the binary mixture .",

    "<S> * abstract * we investigate polymer partitioning from polymer mixtures into nanometer size cavities by formulating an equation of state for a binary polymer mixture assuming that only one ( smaller ) of the two polymer components can penetrate the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> deriving the partitioning equilibrium equations and solving them numerically allows us to introduce the concept of `` _ polymers - pushing - polymers _ '' for the action of non - penetrating polymers on the partitioning of the penetrating polymers . </S>",
    "<S> polymer partitioning into a pore even within a very simple model of a binary polymer mixture is shown to depend in a complicated way on the composition of the polymer mixture and/or the pore - penetration penalty . </S>",
    "<S> this can lead to enhanced as well as diminished partitioning , due to two separate energy scales that we analyse in detail . </S>"
