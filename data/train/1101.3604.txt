    "observation of energy quantization in a macroscopic mechanical oscillator mode is of fundamental interest in exploring the quantum - to - classical transition .",
    "electromechanical systems , where the relevant mechanical mode interacts with devices such as superconducting quantum interference devices , single - electron transistors , cooper - pair boxes , or even other mechanical modes , provide a possible route toward achieving this , and various scenarios have been explored theoretically @xcite-@xcite . experimental realization , however , remains a challenge . a second platform where observation of macroscopic mechanical mode energy quantization may become possible is optomechanics @xcite . in an optomechanical system , a collective vibrational mode of a mesoscopic system , such as a doubly clamped beam @xcite , a ring @xcite ,",
    "a suspended membrane ( `` membrane - in - the - middle '' ) @xcite , or even a cloud of ultracold atoms @xcite-@xcite , is parametrically coupled to an electromagnetic cavity field mode . while also challenging",
    ", there has been much interest in the prospects of experimental observation of macroscopic mechanical mode energy quantization in an optomechanical system due to recent developments . in particular , direct coupling of the optical cavity mode to the square of the mechanical displacement coordinate has been experimentally demonstrated in the `` membrane - in - the - middle '' system @xcite and its ultracold atoms analogue @xcite . under the rotating wave approximation ,",
    "such a coupling allows for a quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) @xcite measurement of the mechanical mode phonon number .",
    "observation of mechanical energy quantization in such a system can then be achieved either indirectly , through phonon shot noise measurement , or directly , by detecting _",
    "quantum jumps _ in the phonon number via continuous measurement of the cavity field .",
    "a. a. clerk _",
    "et al . _ have analyzed the former case in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present an analysis of the latter .",
    "in particular , we show the nature of the displacement of the cavity field in the strongly driven regime in response to changes in the phonon number , and we establish constraints on the parameter space which must be satisfied in order for _ quantum jumps _ of the phonon number to be observed .",
    "there are two ways we can describe a measurement in quantum mechanics .",
    "firstly we can simply give the solution to the master equation describing the interaction between the measured system and the apparatus and any decay channels that may be present .",
    "this is called the _",
    "unconditional evolution_. secondly , in the case of a continuous measurement we wish to describe the _",
    "conditional _ state of the measured system given a particular classical stochastic record for the measurement . for the case",
    "considered here this will require a phase - sensitive measurement of the cavity field , such as homodyne detection .",
    "the measurement record is then a stochastic homodyne current and the evolution of the mechanical resonator is conditioned on a particular realization of this current @xcite .",
    "of course the statistics of the homodyne current itself is partly determined by the quantum state of the mechanical resonator .",
    "the goal is then to reconstruct the quantum trajectory of the mechanical mode by suitably filtering the measurement record , and to observe phonon absorptions and emissions of the mechanical resonator mode as _ retroactive quantum jumps _",
    "@xcite in the trajectory .",
    "if one averages the conditional state of the system over all possible measurement records , one obtains the unconditional state .",
    "we assume the case of a nearly ideal single - port cavity such that the constraint established by miao _",
    "_ in @xcite is satisfied . under a single - mode description of the cavity the generic hamiltonian for the optomechanical system with a drive on",
    "the cavity is @xmath0 where @xmath1 refer to the optical mode and @xmath2 refer to the mechanical mode , @xmath3 is the cavity mode frequency dependent on the mechanical resonator position @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the frequency of the mechanical mode , @xmath6 and @xmath7 refer respectively to the frequency and amplitude of the coherent drive field on the cavity , @xmath8 is the equilibrium position of the mechanical resonator , and @xmath9 is the displacement coordinate of the mechanical mode . if the mechanical resonator is positioned such that @xmath8 is an extremum of @xmath3 , we approximate @xmath10 where @xmath11",
    "we now assume that the optical cavity remains near the steady state it would have reached if @xmath12 . in an interaction picture at the driving frequency , this is a coherent state with amplitude @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the detuning between the cavity driving field and the cavity frequency , and @xmath15 is the cavity damping rate . with no loss of generality we will assume that the phase of @xmath7 may be chosen so that @xmath16 is real .",
    "we now expand the interaction around this steady state value by making the canonical transformation @xmath17 .",
    "after the rotating wave approximation , the effective hamiltonian in the interaction picture may then be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 and we have taken @xmath20 for simplicity . if we now include the damping of the cavity and the mechanical resonator , the total system state is described by the master equation @xmath21+\\kappa{\\cal d}[a]\\rho+\\gamma(\\bar{n}+1){\\cal d}[b]\\rho+\\gamma\\bar{n}{\\cal d}[b^\\dagger]\\rho , \\label{master - eqn}\\ ] ] where @xmath22\\rho = c\\rho c^\\dagger -c^\\dagger c\\rho/2-\\rho c^\\dagger c/2 $ ] , @xmath23 is the mean thermal occupation of the mechanical resonator bath at frequency @xmath5 , @xmath24 is the mechanical mode damping rate , and where we have dropped the bar on the @xmath25 for simplicity of notation .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian in equation ( [ ham - int ] ) indicates that the phonon number operator for the mechanical resonator is not changed by the interaction with the optical field and , in the absence of dissipation , is a constant of the motion .",
    "the model thus describes a qnd measurement of the mechanical resonator s phonon number with the cavity field forming the first stage of the measurement apparatus .",
    "a similar model was considered in walls et al .",
    "@xcite for both components realized as optical field modes , but only mode - a was damped .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , for direct phonon number detection the measurement apparatus must have a dynamical time scale much shorter than that of the phonon number of the relevant mechanical mode .",
    "therefore we begin by considering the dynamics on a time scale over which the mechanical damping can be neglected .",
    "such a problem is represented by the master equation above with @xmath26 .",
    "the solution to this problem was given by walls et al .",
    "in @xcite : @xmath27 \\nonumber \\\\ \\nonumber \\times exp \\left [ ( n - m)\\left(-i\\frac{\\chi}{\\kappa}\\alpha ' ^*-i\\frac{\\chi}{\\kappa}\\alpha\\right)(1-e^{-\\kappa t/2 } ) \\right ] \\left(|n\\rangle\\langle m| \\right)_{(b ) } \\\\ \\otimes\\frac{(|\\alpha_{n}(t)\\rangle\\langle\\alpha_{m}'(t)|)_{(a)}}{\\langle\\alpha_{m}'(t)|\\alpha_{n}(t)\\rangle},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the initial probability distribution such that @xmath29 and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are complex amplitudes corresponding to coherent states of the cavity with @xmath32 and @xmath33 as the initial amplitudes : @xmath34    the solution in equation ( [ wcm - soln ] ) illustrates some important features of quantum measurement .",
    "firstly , for sufficiently strong coupling , the density operator rapidly becomes diagonal in the number basis for the resonator , which is the measured quantity .",
    "secondly , the optical system is driven towards coherent states which are the _ pointer basis states _",
    "@xcite for the damped cavity field .",
    "the rate of diagonalization is proprotional to @xmath35 .",
    "the resulting mixture is a classical correlation between fock states of the resonator and corresponding pointer basis states for the field , and we find in the steady - state @xmath36 , where @xmath37 .",
    "unravelling the full master equation with nonzero @xmath24 is intractable , but since we are required to be in the adiabatic limit we can build our intuition of the full dynamics from the previous section .",
    "the nature of the cavity - environment and cavity - mechanics interaction is the same for both zero and nonzero @xmath24 .",
    "we therefore expect that the classical correlation between mechanical fock states and cavity coherent states is preserved .",
    "it is only the initial distribution of the mechanical fock states that will evolve and the cavity state will adiabatically follow so that @xmath38 . we can verify this by solving the moment equations that follow directly from the master equation ( [ master - eqn ] ) ( which correspond to moments of the _ unconditional state _ ) .",
    "the moment equations are @xmath39 the solutions are @xmath40.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the adiabatic limit we recover @xmath38 , as expected .",
    "it is then apparent that we can extract information about the average phonon number by monitoring the quadrature phase amplitude to the steady state amplitude @xmath16 ( which has been chosen as real ) .",
    "one expects that , prior to the optomechanical coupling turning on , the mechanical resonator will be in thermal equilibrium with its environment , in which case @xmath41 . for long times , the change in the cavity amplitude from the steady background amplitude , @xmath16 , @xmath42 .",
    "we thus regard the ratio @xmath43 as the _ gain _ of the measurement .",
    "as demonstrated by equation ( [ meanphonon ] ) , phonon number quantum jumps are not present in the unobserved system even in the quantum limit .",
    "jump - like behaviour arises only in the presence of a continuous measurement , which is the subject of the next section .",
    "we have shown that information about the phonon number is reflected in the phase quadrature amplitude of the cavity field . under continuous homodyne measurement of this quadrature ,",
    "the system is governed by the following stochastic master equation ( sme ) : @xmath44dt + \\gamma(\\bar{n}+1)\\mathcal{d}[b]\\rho dt + \\gamma\\bar{n}\\mathcal{d}[b^\\dag]\\rho dt + \\kappa\\mathcal{d}[a]\\rho dt \\\\ + \\sqrt{\\eta\\kappa}dw\\mathcal{h}[ae^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{2}}]\\rho.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath45\\rho$ ] is as defined for equation ( [ master - eqn ] ) , @xmath46\\rho = c\\rho + \\rho c^\\dag -$ ] tr@xmath47 is the measurement superoperator , @xmath48 is the detector efficiency , and @xmath49 is the wiener increment . the homodyne measurement signal will be a photocurrent proportional to the cavity phase quadrature amplitude with stochastic noise due to the local oscillator and intrinsic quantum noise of the cavity field : @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "as previously mentioned , we require the cavity to adiabatically follow the mechanical number state . in this limit",
    ", we may adiabatically eliminate the cavity field from the full sme in order to reduce computational overhead .",
    "solving the quantum langevin equation for the steady state of the cavity field gives @xmath52 .",

    "it is straightforward to further simplify to the diagonal elements of @xmath55 : @xmath56dt + \\gamma(\\bar{n}+1)[(n+1)p_{n+1}-np_n]dt - 2\\sqrt{\\eta\\gamma}(n-\\langle n \\rangle)p_n dw.\\ ] ] in the adiabatic limit the photocurrent becomes @xmath57 from hereon we set @xmath58 .",
    "we note that equation ( [ sre ] ) is of the same functional form as the one dealt with in section v. of @xcite , and we refer the reader to that reference for complementary analysis and discussion .    under continuous measurement",
    "the evolution of the system is the result of a competition between two dynamical processes .",
    "the correlation between cavity coherent states and mechanical phonon number established in the previous section indicates that measurement of the cavity field will tend to collapse the variance of the mechanical state in the number state basis .",
    "the thermal bath on the other hand will have the opposite effect .",
    "for jump - like behaviour of the phonon number to arise , the measurement rate must dominate the thermalization rate .",
    "this amounts to the _ adiabatic _ and _ fast - measurement _ conditions , which we now define .    in the absence of measurement ,",

    "the cavity adiabatically follows the number state of the mechanical mode , and the measurement collapses the state of the mechanical mode in the number state basis very rapidly .",
    "therefore we expect that the mechanical state will be a nearly pure number state @xmath66 most of the time with stochastic excitations @xmath67 or decays @xmath68 due to the thermal bath . from the analysis of section iii .",

    ", we numerically integrate equation ( [ sme ] ) with @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 so that we are in the good - measurement limit for low phonon numbers .",
    "we start with the mechanics in the ground state .",
    "the result , figure [ data28 ] , shows well - resolved quantum jumps in the phonon number replicated by the cavity phase quadrature amplitude with a gain of @xmath75 .",
    "the small variance of the phonon number distribution indicates a high purity of the mechanical state .",
    "the quantum trajectory formalism that we use assumes the ideal limit of an infinite amplitude local oscillator , thereby giving the photocurrent white noise with infinite amplitude in the limit that @xmath78 .",
    "numerically , the finite time step limits the noise amplitude and bandwidth .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the experimental situation of a finite amplitude local oscillator and a photodetector with a finite bandwidth .",
    "still , the raw measurment signal , equation [ photocurrent ] , is likely to be dominated by noise from the local oscillator .",
