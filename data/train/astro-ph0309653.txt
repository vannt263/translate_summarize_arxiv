    "our best fits are characterized by @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the haze is best fit by @xmath40 , although this value is extremely dependent on the assumed vertical haze profile and should not be over interpreted .",
    "we found that reasonable fits to the hcn and @xmath17 features required a non - constant vertical abundance .",
    "even with our two variable log - log parameterization we see non - zero residuals on these features , suggesting a more complicated vertical structure which we will explore further in future work with similar spectra covering many more transitions .",
    "other significant non - zero residuals are explained as : an unidentified species at 747.35  @xmath4 , an imperfectly corrected telluric feature at 748.68  @xmath4 , not fitting for the @xmath41cch@xmath9/c@xmath9h@xmath9 ratio at 748.88  @xmath4 , and an h@xmath41cn feature at 749.02  @xmath4 that is missing from the model .",
    "our focus here is propane and thus we do not present uncertainties on the vertical abundance parameters for hcn and @xmath17 . as is apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , random errors are negligible in our spectra .",
    "the other sources of uncertainty are : flux calibration , errors associated with our empirical absorption coefficient method , the extent to which propane abundance is not constant with altitude , the extent to which titan s temperature - pressure profile deviates from that derived by @xcite , and the extent to which propane s abundance varies with latitude .",
    "the uncertainty in flux calibration is at worst 20% , which maps almost linearly into a 20% uncertainty in propane abundance .",
    "the primary potential error from our empirical absorption coefficient method is the mismatch of laboratory sample temperature ( 175  k ) to the temperature of the propane in titan s stratosphere . in our model spectra @xmath42% of the propane flux",
    "arises from the pressure range 13 - 0.24  mbar ( 90 - 250  km altitude ) , where temperatures range over 135 - 175  k. to investigate this uncertainty we re - fit using the blass et al .",
    "linelist ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . ) .",
    "the overall fit is lower quality than with our empirical @xmath33 and the best - fit propane abundance is only 1.1@xmath430.1 times more .",
    "recent photochemical models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) predict that the propane abundance is relatively constant over 400 - 850  km ( 11 - 1.5  @xmath44bar ) . above these altitudes propane",
    "is depleted by photolysis and reaction with c@xmath9h , while below this range the effect of eddy diffusion and the cold - trap of the tropopause is to reduce the propane abundance .",
    "our observations are primarily sensitive to the pressure range 13 - 0.24  mbar ( 90 - 250  km altitude ) , as shown in fig .",
    "we re - fit our spectra using the model predicted propane vertical profile and found a best fit when the model predicted profile is multipled by a factor of 2.9 .",
    "figure  [ fig4]b shows this best - fit scaled profile of @xcite along with the best - fit constant vertical abundance profile .",
    "the quality of the fits to our data do not distinguish between these two cases .",
    "the uncertainty in the @xcite temperature - pressure profile is not well quantified , and therefore our reported uncertainties do not account for this source of error .",
    "roughly , a change in stratospheric temperature of @xmath435  k requires a @xmath4520@xmath12 change in propane abundance .",
    "there is no strong evidence that propane abundance is constant with latitude on titan . a first attempt at modeling the seasonal variation of photochemistry on titan @xcite predicts that propane abundance will vary by a factor of a few from north to south depending on season . with texes on an 8 - 10 meter telescope we would be able to measure the abundance as a function of latitude , which will place new strong constraints on models of seasonal photochemistry .",
    "we present the first spectrally resolved detection of propane in titan s atmosphere .",
    "we measure propane s fractional abundance to be @xmath5 , assuming the recommended temperature - pressure profile of @xcite and a constant abundance with altitude and latitude .",
    "our observations are primarily sensitive to 13 - 0.24  mbar ( 90 - 250  km altitude ) .",
    "alternatively , our data require the predicted propane profile of @xcite to be increased by a factor of 2.9 .",
    "the current theoretical understanding of propane s vibration - rotation spectrum is inadequate and available linelists do not fit our titan spectra nor laboratory propane spectra well .",
    "therefore we fit for titan s propane abundance using an empirical absorption coefficient spectrum derived from low temperature laboratory spectra of propane .",
    "the most important observational advance that can be made towards detecting new species in planetary atmospheres is to increase the spectral resolving power to @xmath46few@xmath47 such that individual lines are resolved and separated .",
    "high spectral resolution allows us to separate the contribution of a minor species ( propane ) from a strongly emitting species ( acetylene ) .",
