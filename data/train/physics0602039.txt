    "evolutionary game theory has become an important tool for investigating and understanding cooperative or altruistic behavior in systems consisting of competitive entities .",
    "these systems may occur in a wide range of problems in different disciplines and include physical , biological , ecological , social , and political systems .",
    "mathematicians , biologists , and physicists alike have found the phenomena of emergence of cooperative behavior fascinating . since the ground - breaking work on repeated or iterated games based on the prisoner s dilemma ( pd ) game by axelrod @xcite ,",
    "there has been a continuous effort on exploring the determining factors on possible cooperative behavior in evolutionary games based on the pd game and its variations @xcite , with a recent emphasis on the effects of spatial structures such as regular lattices @xcite and networks @xcite .",
    "remarkably , it was found that cooperation can be induced in a repeated pd game by cleverly designed strategies .",
    "spatial structures , e.g. , lattices or networks , are found to favor cooperative behavior in the evolutionary pd game .",
    "the two subjects involved in networked games , i.e. , emergence phenomenon and the physics of networks @xcite , are among the most rapidly growing branches in physics .",
    "the present work was motivated by the recent concerns on whether the pd game should be the sole model for studying emerging cooperative phenomena @xcite . due to practical difficulties in accurately quantifying the payoffs in game theory , the snowdrift game ( sg )",
    "has been proposed as possible alternative to the pd game .",
    "previous work on the sg have focused on the effects of connectivity in structures such as lattices @xcite and fully connected networks @xcite .",
    "the latter is also referred to as the well - mixed case in the literature . here",
    ", we investigate the networking effects on an evolutionary snowdrift game @xcite within the watts - strogatz ( ws ) @xcite model of small world constructed by randomly re - wiring a regular network .",
    "starting with a random mixture of competing nodes of opposite characters , we found that ( i ) the steady - state population may consist of only one kind of nodes or a mixture of nodes of different characters , depending on degree @xmath0 in a regular lattice before re - wiring and the extent of re - wiring @xmath1 ; ( ii ) for a wide range of payoffs , a re - wired network _ suppresses _ the fraction of cooperative nodes in the steady state and hence the overall level of cooperation , when compared with a fully connected network or well - mixed case ; ( iii ) networking effect on the critical payoffs for the extinction of one kind of nodes in the steady state depends sensitively on the width or standard deviation of the degree distribution induced by re - wiring .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "the evolutionary snowdrift game and the watts - strogatz network structure are introduced in sec .",
    "section iii gives the numerical results in regular lattices .",
    "two extinction payoffs are identified . an analytic expression for the extinction payoff of defective character",
    "is given , together with a discussion on the discrepancy between observed value and theoretical value of the extinction payoff for runs with finite time steps .",
    "section iv gives the numerical results in re - wired networks .",
    "the dependence on the re - wiring probability is found to be governed by the standard deviation of the degree distribution of the re - wired network . in sec .",
    "v , we give an approximate expression for the extinction payoff and summarize our results .",
    "the basic snowdrift game , which is equivalent to the hawk - dove or chicken game @xcite , is most conveniently described using the following scenario .",
    "consider two drivers hurrying home in opposite directions on a road blocked by a snowdrift .",
    "each driver has two possible actions  to shovel the snowdrift ( cooperate ( c ) ) or not to do anything ( not - to - cooperate or  defect \" ( d ) ) .",
    "this is similar to the pd game in which each player has two options : to cooperate or to defect .",
    "if the two drivers cooperate , they could be back home on time and each will get a reward of @xmath2 .",
    "shovelling is a laborious job with a total cost of @xmath3 .",
    "thus , each driver gets a net reward of @xmath4 .",
    "if both drivers take action d , they both get stuck , and each gets a reward of @xmath5 .",
    "if only one driver takes action c and shovels the snowdrift , then both drivers can get through .",
    "the driver taking action d ( not to shovel ) gets home without doing anything and hence gets a payoff @xmath6 , while the driver taking action c gets a  sucker \" payoff of @xmath7 .",
    "the sg is , therefore , given by the following payoff matrix : @xmath8 the matrix element gives the payoff to a player using a strategy listed in the left hand column when the opponent uses a strategy in the top row .",
    "the sg refers to the case @xmath9 , leading to @xmath10 .",
    "this ordering of the payoffs _ defines _ the sg . without loss of generality ,",
    "it is useful to assign @xmath11 so that the payoffs can be characterized by a single parameter @xmath12 for the cost - to - reward ratio . in terms of @xmath13",
    ", we have @xmath14 , @xmath11 , @xmath15 , and @xmath5 . for a player ,",
    "the best action is : to take d if the opponent takes c , otherwise take c. a larger value of @xmath16 tends to encourage the action d. the sg becomes the pd when the cost @xmath3 is high such that @xmath17 , which amounts to the ranking @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the sg and pd game differ only by the ordering of @xmath19 and @xmath20 . due to the difficulty in measuring payoffs in game theory ,",
    "the sd has been proposed to be a possible alternative to the pd game in studying emerging cooperative phenomena @xcite .",
    "evolutionary snowdrift game amounts to letting the character of a connected population of inhomogeneous players evolve , according to their performance @xcite .",
    "consider @xmath21 players represented by the nodes of a network .",
    "initially , the nodes are randomly assigned to be either of c or d character .",
    "the character of each node is updated every time step simultaneously , according to the following procedure . at each time step",
    ", every node @xmath22 interacts with all its connected @xmath23 neighbors and gets a payoff per neighbor @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is obtained by summing up the @xmath23 payoffs after comparing characters with its neighbors .",
    "here , @xmath23 is the degree of node @xmath22 .",
    "every node @xmath22 then randomly selects a neighbor @xmath26 for possible updating or evolution . to compare the performance of the two nodes @xmath22 and @xmath26",
    ", we construct @xmath27 if @xmath28 , then the character of node @xmath22 is _ replaced _ by the character of node @xmath26 with probability @xmath29 , and thus node @xmath22 becomes the offspring of node @xmath26 .",
    "the denominator @xmath30 in @xmath29 is , therefore , included as a normalization factor .",
    "if @xmath31 , then the character of node @xmath22 remains unchanged . in the long time limit , a state will be attained with possible coexistence of nodes of both characters .",
    "the fraction of @xmath32-nodes @xmath33 , which is often called the frequency of cooperators @xcite , measures the extent of cooperation in the whole system and is determined by the structure of the underlying network _ and _ the payoff parameter @xmath16 . in a fully connected network , @xmath34 @xcite . in two - dimensional lattices with nearest - neighboring and next - nearest neighboring connections ,",
    "it has recently been observed that the spatial structure tends to lower @xmath33 @xcite , when compared with a fully connected network . in contrast",
    ", spatial connections are found to enhance @xmath35 in evolutionary pd games .",
    "we note that one may define @xmath29 in different ways .",
    "popular alternatives of @xmath29 in evolutionary games include the use of the total payoff instead of an average payoff per neighbor for which the effects of a spread in the degrees of different nodes will be much more prominent and allowing for the possibility of replacing the character of a node by that of a neighboring node with lower payoff . in our choice of @xmath29 ,",
    "a node will only have a chance to be replaced if it encounters a better performing node .",
    "the physics of complex networks @xcite is a fascinating research area of current interest .",
    "here , the nodes in an evolutionary sg are connected in the form of the watts - strogatz @xcite small - world model . starting with a one - dimensional regular world consisting of a circular chain ,",
    "i.e. , periodic boundary condition , of @xmath21 nodes with each node having a degree @xmath36 connecting to its @xmath36 nearest neighbors , each of the @xmath0 links to the right hand side of a node is cut and re - wired to a randomly chosen node with a probability @xmath1 .",
    "this simple model gives the small world effect @xcite , which refers to the commonly observed phenomena of small separations between two randomly chosen nodes in many real - life networks @xcite , for @xmath37 .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 ( @xmath38 ) thus takes the network from a regular world through the small world to a random world , with a fixed mean degree @xmath39 . here",
    ", we aim at understanding how the frequency of cooperators @xmath35 behaves as the parameters characterizing the the spatial structure @xmath0 and @xmath1 change , and as the payoff parameter @xmath16 characterizing the evolutionary dynamics changes .",
    "figure 1(a ) shows @xmath35 as a function of @xmath16 in _ regular lattices _ ( @xmath40 ) of @xmath41 nodes with different values of @xmath0 .",
    "the dashed line gives the result @xmath42 for the well - mixed case .",
    "the key features are : ( i ) there exists a value @xmath43 so that @xmath44 for @xmath45 , i.e. , the extinction of d - nodes and all nodes become cooperative in nature , ( ii ) for @xmath45 , @xmath35 is enhanced when compared with the well - mixed case , ( iii ) for a wide range of @xmath16 , the frequency of cooperators drops below that in the well - mixed case , ( iv ) there exists a value @xmath46 so that @xmath47 for @xmath48 , i.e. , the extinction of cooperative nodes @xcite .",
    "these extinction payoffs thus characterize a transition between a homogeneous and an inhomogeneous population as the payoff @xmath16 is varied .",
    "figures 1(b ) and 1(c ) show that the extinction payoff for defectors ( cooperators ) @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) decreases ( increases ) monotonically with @xmath0 in regular lattices .",
    "numerically , it is found that for @xmath51 , @xmath43 is close to @xmath52 ; while for @xmath53 , @xmath43 is closer to @xmath54 .",
    "in addition , we observe that for @xmath53 , the relation @xmath55 is satisfied .",
    "the feature ( iii ) is analogous to that observed in two - dimensional lattices @xcite .",
    "we have also found that @xmath49 and @xmath50 are independent of the number of nodes @xmath21 , as long as @xmath56 . as the shortest path @xmath57 scales with @xmath21 in regular lattices ,",
    "the results imply that the @xmath0-dependence of the extinction payoffs does not come from @xmath58 , although @xmath58 is an important quantity in the description of networks .",
    "clearly , the time it takes the system from the initial configuration to that in the long time limit would depend on @xmath21 and hence @xmath58 .",
    "analytically , the value of @xmath43 can be estimated as follows .",
    "recall that a higher value of @xmath16 promotes d - character and @xmath49 refers to the highest value of @xmath16 below which no d - node exists . since replacements are carried out probabilistically , it is , therefore , important to consider cases where there are only a few d - nodes and how these patterns will be replaced .",
    "note that for any value of @xmath0 , a _",
    "d - node in an otherwise c - node environment will _ not _ be replaced .",
    "the reason is the following .",
    "the average payoff for the single d - node is @xmath59 .",
    "note that only the c - nodes that are connected to the d - node may be involved in a possible evolution . for these c - nodes , their average payoff @xmath60 , where the subscript indicate that it is the average payoff for a c - node that is linked to one d - node .",
    "thus , for the whole range of @xmath16 , @xmath61 and thus a single d - node will not be replaced by its connected c - neighbors .",
    "this leads us to consider the patterns involving d - nodes , called the last surviving patterns , that can be replaced by c - nodes in one time step .",
    "the case of @xmath62 serves to illustrate the key ideas in estimating @xmath49 . for @xmath62",
    ", the single d - node pattern will be evolved into one with a pair of neighboring d - nodes .",
    "the chain becomes that of ... ccccddcccc .... because each d - node has a d - neighbor and the d - d payoff is @xmath5 , the average payoff of the d - nodes becomes @xmath63 .",
    "the payoff of the c - nodes that are linked to a d - node is @xmath64 . by equating @xmath65 and @xmath66",
    ", we obtain an estimate of @xmath67 for @xmath62 , which agrees with numerical results . for @xmath68 , @xmath69 and thus the d - d dimer pattern may evolve into an all - c chain , provided that both d - nodes randomly pick the neighboring c - node and evolve into c - character with the probability @xmath29 in the _ same _ time step .",
    "thus , the key features for a last surviving pattern are : ( i ) we need at least two connected d - nodes , and ( ii ) the c - nodes that are connected to only one of these surviving d - nodes have a higher chance to replace the d - nodes .",
    "the discussion also serves to point out the importance of run time in numerical studies .",
    "when the system evolves to the last surviving pattern , the pattern may or may not evolve into an all - c pattern .",
    "it only happens probabilistically .",
    "the time it takes , even when @xmath45 , for the all - c pattern to emerge depends on the values of @xmath16 and @xmath0 . for @xmath70 and for larger values of @xmath0 , the time may be exceedingly long so that a smaller value of @xmath49 than that theoretically allowed will be determined numerically .    extending the argument to @xmath71 regular lattices",
    ", a single d - node will evolve into one of the last surviving patterns shown in figure 2 . in both patterns , there are two types of neighboring c - nodes . for the c - nodes connected to only one d - node , the average payoff @xmath72 .",
    "for the c - nodes connected to two d - nodes , @xmath73 .",
    "for the d - nodes , @xmath74 . note that in general @xmath75 . since there are more c - nodes with one d - neighbor in the pattern in figure 2(a ) than figure 2(b ) , the d - nodes in figure 2(a ) are most likely to be the last surviving pattern in numerical simulations .",
    "there are two values of @xmath16 that are of interest . for @xmath76",
    ", we have @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , all the neighboring c - nodes have a finite probability to replace the two d - nodes in one time step .",
    "this is why it is easier to observe an all - c pattern for @xmath78 . in principle",
    ", @xmath49 can be found by equating @xmath66 and @xmath65 , giving @xmath79 .",
    "however , for @xmath80 , we have @xmath81 .",
    "these inequalities imply that even if we arrive at the patterns in figure 2 , the chance of replacing _ both _ d - nodes by c - character is small , since only the c - nodes connected to one d - node can carry out the replacement .",
    "instead , the d - nodes may replace the c - nodes linked to both d - nodes to arrive at a pattern with more d - nodes .",
    "this prevents the all - c pattern from emerging in any run of reasonably long run time .",
    "this effect is obviously more severe as @xmath0 increases , as there will be more c - nodes with two d - neighbors .    generalizing the argument to arbitrary value of @xmath0",
    ", we have @xmath82 and @xmath83 . thus , _ in principle _ , @xmath84 .",
    "however , for any practical run times , the all - c pattern is hard to observe for @xmath85 , except for @xmath62 and @xmath86 .",
    "thus , the numerical results in figure 1 , which are obtained by fixing the run time to be @xmath87 time steps , give @xmath88 for @xmath53 .",
    "we have tried longer run times , e.g. , @xmath89 time steps , and the value of @xmath49 only tends to approach the value @xmath52 very slowly .",
    "going beyond regular lattices , figure 3(a ) shows @xmath35 as a function of @xmath16 in watts - strogatz ( ws ) networks with different re - wiring probabilities @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the network consists of @xmath41 nodes and @xmath93 , with the run time fixed at @xmath87 time steps .",
    "results in a regular lattice ( @xmath40 ) and fully connected networks ( dashed line ) are also included for comparison .",
    "it is noted that the effect of increasing @xmath1 for fixed @xmath0 is similar to increasing @xmath0 for fixed @xmath40 ( regular lattices ) .",
    "the main features are that as @xmath1 increases , the extinction payoff @xmath49 decreases and the @xmath35 is higher than that in a regular lattice with the same value of @xmath0 for a large range of @xmath16 .",
    "figures 3(b ) and ( c ) show that , for fixed @xmath93 , the extinction payoff @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) drops ( rises ) with the re - wiring probability @xmath1 .",
    "we have checked that while the shortest path @xmath94 changes sensitively with @xmath1 , it is however not the determining factor for the extinction payoffs .",
    "will the clustering coefficient @xmath32 matter ? for regular lattices , @xmath32 increases with @xmath0 and saturates at large @xmath0 following @xmath95 $ ] @xcite .",
    "if the drop in @xmath49 with @xmath0 in regular lattices were attributed to the increase in @xmath32 , then one would have expected @xmath49 to _ increase _ with @xmath1 as @xmath96 decreases with @xmath1 in ws networks @xcite .",
    "this is , however , _ not _ what is observed in numerical results .",
    "therefore , the clustering coefficient @xmath32 is also not a determining factor for @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "these observations are in sharp contrast to the networking effects in evolutionary pd games @xcite . noting that the ws networks have a fixed @xmath97 with or without re - wiring , @xmath49 and @xmath50 can not be determined by the mean degree @xmath98 .",
    "thus , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are not determined by the commonly studied quantities in networks .    the results in figures 1 and 3 revealed that the extinction payoffs @xmath99 and @xmath100 depend on both the structural parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "it does remain an intriguing problem of which geometrical property ( properties ) of a re - wired network determines @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the watts - strogatz networks . in what follows",
    ", we will focus on analyzing @xmath99 , as @xmath101 .",
    "figure 4 shows collectively the numerical results ( symbols ) of @xmath99 for different values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , for a longer fixed run time of @xmath102 time steps .",
    "as discussed , the numerical results for @xmath43 in a regular lattice may not come out to be @xmath52 even using a longer run time , we could avoid this problem and focus on the effects of re - wiring , i.e. , @xmath103 , by exploring the behavior of the difference in @xmath99 and @xmath104 .",
    "interestingly , we found that by plotting @xmath105 as a function of @xmath1 , the numerical data for different values of @xmath0 basically follow the same functional form , as shown by the symbols in figure 5 . examining the @xmath1-dependence , we notice that the behavior is similar to that in the _ standard deviation _",
    "@xmath106 of the degree distribution @xmath107 in the watts - strogatz networks .",
    "the re - wiring process changes @xmath107 gradually from a delta - function at @xmath108 for @xmath40 to a distribution that has a lower cutoff at @xmath109 with a finite @xmath106 that increases with @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "more specifically , @xmath110 which follows from the degree distribution of the watts - strogatz model",
    ". motivated by this observation , we use the numerical data in figure 4 and perform a fit to the functional form @xmath111 where @xmath112 is a fitting parameter . the first term in the denominator of eq .",
    "( 4 ) imposes the restriction that the fitted line must pass through the @xmath40 data point .",
    "the fitted lines are also shown in figure 4 . with only one fitting parameter for each value of @xmath0 ,",
    "the lines fit the data accurately .",
    "this implies that the @xmath1-dependence follows that in @xmath106 .",
    "the fitting parameters are found to be @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 .",
    "note that @xmath112 drops with @xmath0 ( see inset in fig .",
    "since @xmath106 carries a factor of @xmath116 , the combination @xmath117 becomes quite insensitive to @xmath0 , with @xmath2 increasing from @xmath118 for @xmath93 to @xmath119 for @xmath120 . as a consistency check",
    ", we also plot the fitted lines in figure 5 , using the same coefficients @xmath112 as obtained in figure 4 .",
    "note that even for @xmath121 , the spread in the data and fitted lines is small , reflecting the weak @xmath0-dependence in the coefficients @xmath122 .",
    "the extinction payoff is thus found to be described by @xmath123 where @xmath2 carries only a weak @xmath0-dependence .",
    "our results on the extinction payoff @xmath99 in the watts - strogatz networks can be summarized as follows .",
    "the dependence on @xmath0 is dominated by that in @xmath43 and the @xmath1-dependence follows that of the standard deviation @xmath106 of the degree distribution .",
    "our analytic approach in getting @xmath49 in regular lattices ( see sec .",
    "iii ) can also be applied to re - wired networks .",
    "the difference is that in a re - wired network , different nodes may have different number of neighbors , i.e. , different degrees .",
    "again , we consider a last surviving pattern with two connected d - nodes with otherwise c - neighbors .",
    "let @xmath124 be the degree of one of the d - nodes .",
    "therefore , this d - node has @xmath125 c - neighbors and one d - neighbor .",
    "let @xmath126 be the degree of one of these c - neighbors or the typical degree of these c - neighbors .",
    "we assume that the c - nodes are only connected to one d - node , as they are the ones more likely to replace the d - nodes .",
    "for the d - node , the average payoff is : @xmath127 while for the c - node , the average payoff is : @xmath128 for regular lattices , @xmath129 and @xmath130 is recovered when we equate @xmath65 to @xmath131 .",
    "in addition , as @xmath0 increases in a regular lattice , @xmath132 , which is the result in the well - mixed case . in general , equating eq .",
    "( 6 ) and eq . ( 7 ) gives @xmath133 the meaning of @xmath134 is that , if a last surviving pattern of the considered structure is approached in a numerical simulation , then for @xmath135 , such a pattern may become all - c in one time step .",
    "equation ( 8) suggests several possibilities on estimating @xmath49 .",
    "a lower bound of @xmath49 can be constructed by noting that a d - node occupying a node of high degree can take advantage of the many c - neighbors and hence requires a lower value of @xmath16 to replace it .",
    "similarly , a surrounding c - node with fewer c - neighbors has lower average payoff and hence is harder to replace the d - nodes .",
    "let @xmath136 be the maximum degree in a re - wired network for given @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the minimum degree in a watts - strogatz network is close to @xmath0 after re - wiring .",
    "an extreme ( but rare ) case is that of a d - node occupying a degree with @xmath137 being surrounded by c - nodes that occupy nodes with degree @xmath0 . a more reasonable assumption is to take the degree of the c - nodes as the mean degree @xmath36 , as any one of the c - nodes",
    "may be picked in the evolution step .",
    "we can substitute @xmath138 and @xmath139 to get an estimate of a lower bound @xmath140 we have checked that eq .",
    "( 9 ) indeed gives values that are lower than numerical results .",
    "more interestingly , @xmath136 turns out to depend on @xmath1 through the standard deviation @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "hence , eq .",
    "( 9 ) does reproduce the drop of @xmath49 as @xmath1 increases , as observed in fig.4 .",
    "it is also possible to relate eq .",
    "( 8) to eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) . assuming that , after averaging over runs in numerical studies , that @xmath126 and @xmath124 can both be approximated as some typical degree @xmath141 , then eq .",
    "( 8) suggests that the extinction payoff would be @xmath142 since the dynamics in evolutionary sg depends on the average payoffs , which in turn depends on the geometrical structure of the neighborhood of a node , we expect in general @xmath143 is different from the mean degree @xmath36 .",
    "instead , d - node tends to survive easily by staying on nodes of higher degree . comparing eq.(10 ) with eq .",
    "( 4 ) , we notice that the fitted result to numerical data implies that @xmath144 where the first term should in principle be @xmath36 .    in summary ,",
    "we investigated the extent of cooperation that would emerge in a networked evolutionary snowdrift game . the random re - wiring model of watts and strogatz is used . comparing to a fully connected network , a spatial structure of regular lattices suppresses @xmath35 over a wide range of the payoff @xmath16 and re - wiring lowers the suppression .",
    "we identified two extinction payoffs @xmath49 and @xmath50 . for regular lattices",
    ", @xmath49 should take on the value of @xmath52 , although a value closer to @xmath54 is usually observed in numerical studies .",
    "the dependence of @xmath99 on @xmath0 and @xmath1 is highly non - trivial .",
    "the key network property that gives the @xmath1-dependence is found to be the standard deviation of the degree distribution .",
    "this finding , in turn , implies that it is the existence of nodes with higher degrees due to randomly re - wiring that plays a dominant role in determining the extinction payoffs .",
