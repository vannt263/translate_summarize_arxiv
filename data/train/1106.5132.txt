    "the strong coupling constant , @xmath0 , is one of the fundamental parameters of the standard model of particle physics .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath0 is predicted by the renormalization group equation ( rge ) .",
    "the value of @xmath0 has been determined in many different processes , including a large number of results from hadronic jet production , in either @xmath4 annihilation or in deep - inelastic @xmath5 scattering ( dis ) up to energies of @xmath6gev  @xcite .",
    "prior to the analysis presented in this article , however , only a single result had been obtained from jet production in hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "this @xmath0 result is @xmath7 , extracted by the cdf collaboration from the inclusive jet cross section in @xmath1 collisions at @xmath8tev  @xcite .",
    "all individual uncertainty contributions for this result are larger than those from comparable results from @xmath4 annihilation or dis  @xcite .",
    "the first part of this article presents a recent @xmath0 determination from the d  collaboration from the inclusive jet cross section with significantly improved precision .",
    "conceptual limitations of the approach are discussed , and how those are addressed in the d  analysis .",
    "the second part introduces a new observable to which these conceptual limitations do not apply , and which will be valuable for future @xmath0 determinations in new energy regimes accessible at the tevatron and at the lhc .",
    "a new d  analysis  @xcite extracts the value of @xmath0 from inclusive jet cross section data in @xmath1 collisions at @xmath2tev .",
    "it is based on a recent d  measurement of the inclusive jet cross section  @xcite with unprecedented precision at a hadron collider .",
    "the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) prediction for the inclusive jet cross section is given by @xmath9 where the @xmath10 are the perturbative coefficients , the @xmath11 are the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the initial state hadrons , and the `` @xmath12 '' sign denotes the convolution over the momentum fractions @xmath13 , @xmath14 of the hadrons .",
    "the sum runs over all powers @xmath15 of @xmath0 which contribute to the calculation .",
    "the d  result is based on nlo pqcd ( @xmath16 ) plus 2-loop contributions from threshold corrections  @xcite ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the latter reduce the scale dependence of the calculations , leading to a significant reduction of the corresponding uncertainties . while the @xmath11 have no explicit @xmath0 dependence",
    ", our knowledge of @xmath11 depends on @xmath0 ( due to @xmath0 assumptions in the pdf analyses ) .",
    "since the rge uniquely relates the value of @xmath18 at any scale @xmath19 to the value of @xmath20 , all equations can be expressed in terms of @xmath20 . the total theory prediction for inclusive jet production",
    "is given by the pqcd result in ( [ eq : pqcd ] ) , multiplied by a correction factor for non - perturbative effects @xmath21 the pqcd results are computed in fastnlo  @xcite which is based on nlojet++  @xcite and the calculations from ref .",
    "@xcite . to determine @xmath20 ,",
    "recent pdf results are used and @xmath20 is varied in @xmath22 ( i.e.  simultaneously in the matrix elements and in the pdfs ) until @xmath23 agrees with the data .",
    "there are , however , two conceptual issues when extracting @xmath0 from cross section data .    1 .",
    "when performing the dglap evolution of the pdfs , all pdf analyses are assuming the validity of the rge which has so far been tested only for energies up to 209gev . since extracting @xmath0 at higher energies means testing ( and therefore questioning ) the rge , using these pdfs as input would be inconsistent",
    "d  jet data have been used in all recent global pdf analyses .",
    "the pdf uncertainties are therefore correlated with the experimental uncertainties in those kinematic regions in which the d  jet data had strong impact on the pdf results . as shown in figs .",
    "5153 in ref .",
    "@xcite , this is the case for the proton s gluon density at @xmath24 . since the correlations between pdf uncertainties and experimental uncertainties are not documented , the @xmath0 extraction should avoid using those data points which already had significant impact on the pdf results .    in light of the second issue , the d  @xmath0 extraction uses only data points which are insensitive to @xmath24 . since all of these data points have @xmath25 below 145gev , the first issue does not become relevant here .",
    "this leaves 22 ( out of 110 ) inclusive jet data points .",
    "recent d  results from a determination of the strong coupling constant from inclusive jet cross section data , compared to corresponding results in dis fom hera .",
    ", width=317 ]    the @xmath0 extraction uses pdfs from the mstw2008 analysis  @xcite which were obtained at nnlo ( consistent with the precision of the theory calculation used here ) .",
    "these pdfs have been determined for 21 @xmath20 values between @xmath26 and @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "the continuous @xmath20 dependence of the pqcd cross sections is obtained by interpolating the cross section results for the pdf sets for different @xmath20 values .",
    "pdf uncertainties are computed using the twenty uncertainty eigenvectors ( corresponding to 68%  c.l . ) .",
    "the uncertainties in the pqcd calculation due to uncalculated higher - order contributions are estimated from the @xmath28 dependence of the calculations when varying the renormalization and factorization scales in the range @xmath29 . in a first step",
    ", data points with same @xmath25 are combined to determine nine values of @xmath30 for @xmath31gev .",
    "these results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] and compared to results obtained in dis . a combined determination from all 22 data points",
    "yields a result of @xmath32 this is currently the most precise result from a hadron collider , with similar precision as recent results from jet production in dis .",
    "preliminary d  results for the multijet cross section ratio @xmath3 , measured as a function of @xmath33 for different @xmath34 requirements . theory calculations for @xmath35 and for different pdfs",
    "are compared to the data .",
    ", height=226 ]    the conceptual issues discussed above , which limit the @xmath36 range , and therefore also the @xmath25 range of the data points used in the @xmath0 determination , are both related to the fact that the observable is sensitive to the proton pdfs which are required as external input in the @xmath0 determination .",
    "these limitations can be avoided by studying observables which are largely independent of the pdfs , but still sensitive to @xmath0 .",
    "one class of such observables are ratios of multijet cross sections .",
    "the variable @xmath3 represents the conditional probability that a given inclusive dijet event also has a third jet .",
    "it is defined as the ratio of the inclusive 3-jet and dijet cross sections and investigated as a function of @xmath33 , the transverse momentum of the leading jet in an event , which is a common scale for the 3-jet and the dijet production processes .",
    "therefore @xmath37 is directly sensitive to @xmath0 at the scale @xmath38 while the pdfs cancel to a large extent in the cross section ratio . technically , the @xmath15-jet cross section ( for @xmath16 ) is defined by all events with @xmath15 or more jets with @xmath25 above @xmath34 , in a given rapidity region ( here : @xmath39 for the @xmath15 leading jets ) .",
    "the preliminary results of a recent d  measurement of @xmath3  @xcite , obtained for different values of @xmath40gev , are corrected to particle level and presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] as a function of @xmath33 .",
    "the data are well described by theory calculations based on nlo pqcd plus non - perturbative corrections , for different pdfs  @xcite using in all cases @xmath41 ( in the matrix elements and in the pdfs ) . in the future",
    ", measurements of @xmath3 and related observables will provide a solid basis for determinations of @xmath0 over the whole @xmath25 region , accessible at the tevatron and the lhc , and without conceptual issues related to the proton pdfs .",
    "such results will allow testing the rge in a novel energy regime .",
