    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 meson hadronic matrix elements play an important rle in determinations of the ckm matrix elements and overconstraining the unitarity triangle of the standard model .",
    "form factors , decay constants and bag parameters are determined from these hadronic matrix elements which can be calculated directly on the lattice .",
    "@xmath0 factories ( babar and belle ) and charm factories ( cleo - c ) will reduce experimental uncertainties in measurements of decay process , leaving the theoretical calculations as the dominant uncertainty .",
    "although the focus of lattice heavy quark calculations has traditionally been on @xmath0 physics , new experiments such as cleo - c will determine @xmath2 and semileptonic branching fractions to a few percent , testing lattice results for these quantities .    in this",
    "talk i will report on progress made in the last year in calculations of heavy quark quantities .",
    "many quantities have now been determined by different groups using different heavy quark methods .",
    "the talk is organised as follows .",
    "i begin by discussing the status of quenched and unquenched calculations of the leptonic decay constants .",
    "progress in determinations of the @xmath0 parameters , @xmath3 , which together with @xmath4 are relevant to determinations of @xmath5 and @xmath6 and to @xmath7 width and @xmath8 hadron lifetime measurements , is then reviewed . turning to semileptonic decays ,",
    "i will focus on @xmath9 and a new method to determine the zero - recoil form factor of @xmath10 .",
    "a new calculation of the @xmath8 quark mass and an outstanding puzzle in lattice calculations of spin splittings are briefly discussed .",
    "the calculations described here employ three different heavy quark methods , each of which has different systematic errors .",
    "the ukqcd and ape groups use a nonperturbatively @xmath11-improved sheikholeslami - wohlert ( sw ) action ( npsw ) at quark masses about that of charm .",
    "results are extrapolated to the @xmath8 quark guided by heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) .",
    "a large source of uncertainty comes from this extrapolation .",
    "it is well known that the nonperturbative @xmath11-improvement scheme breaks down in the limit @xmath12 .",
    "this was discussed last year by bernard  @xcite and an explicit example was given at this conference by kurth and sommer  @xcite .",
    "they have shown that the continuum limit ( @xmath13 ) must be taken before an extrapolation in heavy mass is attempted .",
    "in nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd )  @xcite the heavy quark is assumed to be nonrelativistic ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "relativistic momenta are excluded by introducing a finite cut - off such that @xmath15 .",
    "then , @xmath16 and the qcd lagrangian can be expanded in powers of @xmath17 .",
    "this has been successful for @xmath0 physics , where the quark mass is large , so the expansion is convergent .",
    "the theory is nonrenormalisable but at finite lattice spacing , lattice artefacts can be removed by including higher orders in @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    the fermilab approach ( fnal )  @xcite , as used in current heavy quark calculations , is a re - interpretation of the sw action which identifies and correctly renormalises nonrelativistic operators present in the sw action .",
    "discretisation errors are then @xmath19 and not @xmath20 .",
    "the existence of a continuum limit means a continuum extrapolation is possible .",
    "an implementation of the full approach , for @xmath11-improvement , has been done by the fermilab group  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 meson decay constant is an input in determinations of the ckm matrix element @xmath5 through @xmath21 mixing .",
    "the mixing , @xmath22 , is known quite precisely and the dominant uncertainty comes from @xmath23 .",
    "a compilation of recent determinations of @xmath24 and @xmath25 is shown in figs  [ fig : fbnf0 ] and  [ fig : fdnf0 ] .",
    "= 7.5 cm    = 7.5 cm    the calculations are ordered by the heavy quark action used .",
    "the solid bands indicate my average for the particular heavy quark action used and values of @xmath24 obtained for a given heavy quark action can be seen to be in good agreement .",
    "in addition there is a clear overlap between results from the different heavy quark actions .",
    "the most recent calculations of @xmath25 in fig  [ fig : fdnf0 ] also show there is broad general agreement between groups and between the two treatments of heavy quarks . in 2001",
    "the cp - pacs and ukqcd collaborations both reported updates to their quenched determinations of @xmath24 , in refs  @xcite and  @xcite respectively . in this cp - pacs calculation an nrqcd action , corrected to @xmath26 , is used and @xmath24 is been determined in both the quenched approximation and using unquenched gauge configurations .",
    "the unquenched result is unchanged and is included in table  [ tab : fbnf2 ] .",
    "the central value in the quenched approximation is also unchanged from that discussed at lattice00 by bernard  @xcite .",
    "however , the systematic error has been revised upwards to reflect the observed large discretisation effects .",
    "the estimate of the continuum value is now @xmath27 mev and @xmath28 mev , where the first error is statistical and the second is the uncertainty due to discretisation .",
    "there are additional uncertainties in excess of 30% from setting the lattice scale and 3% in @xmath29 from ambiguities in determining the strange quark mass .",
    "although the central value is in reasonable agreement with results from other groups such large discretisation errors have not been observed previously .",
    "this scaling analysis is done using fairly coarse lattices , @xmath30 but , nonetheless , both glok and jlqcd who also use an nrqcd action corrected to @xmath26 and take operator mixing fully into account , as in the cp - pacs calculation , see no such scaling violations .",
    "the glok group were the first to show that including the @xmath31 discretisation correction to the heavy - light axial current leads to a significant decrease in scaling violations of @xmath24 .",
    "indeed both glok and jlqcd find quite mild dependence on the lattice spacing , in contrast to cp - pacs .",
    "the calculations differ in the choice of gauge action .",
    "cp - pacs use an iwasaki rgi action which although it has been shown to have small scaling violations , the decay constants seem to be an exception  @xcite .    it is important to understand the reason for the observed scaling violations , especially in a quenched calculation , where a motivation for the approximation is that it allows us to control and understand other systematic uncertainties .    the systematic errors in the calculation of decay constants by lellouch and lin in ref  @xcite",
    "have been revised to include the effects of using different physical quantities to determine @xmath32 .",
    "the changes involved are very small .",
    "the results of the ukqcd collaboration , reported in 1999 in ref  @xcite and discussed last year in ref  @xcite have been substantially revised .",
    "the new analysis was described by maynard at this conference  @xcite .",
    "ukqcd determine @xmath24 using a non - perturbatively @xmath11-improved action , extrapolated from charm to the bottom quark mass .",
    "the first change is in the current and mass improvement and renormalisation coefficients . a consistent set of nonperturbative coefficients , as determined by bhattacharya _",
    "@xcite is used .",
    "secondly , the scale is set by the pion decay constant rather than @xmath33 as previously .",
    "this is a better choice since @xmath33 is poorly determined experimentally .",
    "finally , an extended discussion and analysis of the systematic errors and in particular the error in the heavy mass extrapolation is included .",
    "the mass - dependent normalisations proposed in the fermilab formalism  @xcite and by bernard  @xcite are compared to the nonperturbative normalisation which is used to determine the central value .",
    "the effect of @xmath34 lattice artefacts at the charm scale on the extrapolation to the bottom quark mass is studied by simultaneously fitting data from two lattice spacings to @xmath35 this is the usual hqet scaling relation with additional mass - dependent terms . from the fit a so - called `` quasi - continuum '' result is determined and compared to fits at individual lattice spacings , the difference being taken as a measure of the effect of @xmath34 lattice artefacts . while the method proposed here is a reasonable one , the size of the error envelope at the @xmath0 meson mass from a fit to eqn  [ eqn : massextrap ] would be a more realistic estimate of the uncertainty in this extrapolation .",
    "this would almost certainly be larger than the error currently quoted by ukqcd .",
    "i conclude this section with a description of a calculation by davies _",
    "@xcite of @xmath24 at rest and at non - zero momentum , using nrqcd .",
    "the motivation for such a study comes from the need to understand momentum - dependent errors in semileptonic decays , for which @xmath24 offers an easy place to start .",
    "the matrix element @xmath36 is studied with temporal , @xmath37 and spatial , @xmath38 currents .",
    "a number of different smearings are investigated and narrow smearing of heavy quarks is found to be optimal for moving @xmath0 mesons . constrained curve fitting  @xcite gives reliable results at momenta up to @xmath39 , in units @xmath40 and good agreement is found for @xmath24 at zero and non - zero momentum .",
    "finally , the discrepancy discussed in ref  @xcite between @xmath24 from @xmath37 and @xmath38 is resolved by including a correct power counting and appropriate normalisation of the different @xmath41 in the matrix element .",
    "the last year has seen some new calculations of decay constants with dynamical quarks . these and other recent calculations are summarised in table  [ tab : fbnf2 ] . as in the quenched case",
    "these calculations are performed with a number of heavy quark actions .",
    "i will discuss the results marked as `` new '' in table  [ tab : fbnf2 ] .",
    "details of the other calculations can be found in the references quoted and in ref  @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath42 is defined from eqn  [ eqn : b2pirate ] as @xmath43 and similarly for @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath45 calculation is discussed in section  [ sec : d2pi ] .",
    "this decay has traditionally received less attention than the @xmath9 . with the planned charm factories at cleo - c and",
    "elsewhere it is increasingly important to focus on @xmath1 meson decays .",
    "this is a region of quark mass where fermilab s nonrelativistic interpretation and the @xmath11-improved approach should be in agreement .",
    "a nice advantage in this decay is that lattice calculations can reach the entire kinematical range with no extrapolation in @xmath47 .",
    "this removes what is one of the major problems with the @xmath0 meson decay .",
    "both ape and fermilab have reported results for the decay @xmath45 .",
    "in addition the ape group presented their results for @xmath48 .",
    "preliminary results for this transition were presented by the fermilab group in ref  @xcite .    as already indicated by fig  [ fig : b2pimassdep ] the results of the fermilab and ape analysis",
    "do not agree at the @xmath1 meson .",
    "the difference is even greater when one looks at the differential decay rate since @xmath49 .",
    "there are a number of differences in both the action and improvement coefficients and the analysis of the groups .",
    "the fermilab group define the quark mass from the kinetic mass rather than the rest mass , as ape does . in lattice calculations of heavy quark systems",
    "the kinetic and rest masses do not agree .",
    "the kinetic mass describes the dynamics of a nonrelativistic system and this choice is advocated in the fermilab formalism ( as well , of course , as in nrqcd ) .",
    "however , at masses around that of charm the difference between rest and kinetic mass is not as great and the choice of one definition rather than the other can not , i believe , explain the lack of agreement .",
    "further differences arise in the current renormalistation . in the fermilab scheme",
    "the bulk of this is done nonperturbatively in a fully mass - dependent way . the remaining matching from lattice hqet to continuum hqet",
    "is done at one - loop level in perturbation theory .",
    "ape use a nonperturbative determination of the matching coefficients for massless quarks with the so - called klm term to correct for @xmath50 effects .",
    "in addition there are differences such as the use of a quadratic ( fermilab ) and a linear ( ape ) chiral extrapolation",
    ". it may be that these differences combine to produce the large discrepancy seen in the form factors . with experiments soon to test lattice predictions",
    "it is important to understand what is going on .",
    "i would also like to note that the ukqcd collaboration do have preliminary results .",
    "since they are not final i have not included them in this discussion although interestingly they lie between the fermilab and ape results .",
    "new results were presented in two talks at this conference .",
    "simone  @xcite reported on work by the fermilab group to measure the form factors for this decay at zero recoil .",
    "lacagnina  @xcite reported preliminary results from ukqcd for the shape of the isgur - wise function determined from @xmath10 and @xmath52 .",
    "i will focus the fermilab results since they were ( almost ) final at the time of the conference and the calculation has recently been completed and appeared in ref  @xcite .",
    "at the zero recoil point the simple relation @xmath53 holds and heavy quark symmetry constrains @xmath54 to have the heavy quark expansion @xmath55 .",
    "\\label{eqn : ha1}\\ ] ] in eqn  [ eqn : ha1 ] the radiative correction , @xmath56 is known to two - loop level from a calculation by czarnecki and melnikov  @xcite .",
    "the three @xmath57s are hadronic matrix elements of the hqet and are calculable in lattice qcd .    to determine these matrix elements , for the first time in a lattice calculation , a new method is introduced .",
    "it exploits an idea developed in a previous paper where double ratios of matrix elements were used to determine the form factors of @xmath52 at zero recoil  @xcite .",
    "three such double ratios are employed to determine @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath60 where @xmath61 is defined by @xmath62 .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath63 and @xmath59 are obtained from the heavy quark expansions of @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively .",
    "the required form factor , @xmath66 can then be reconstructed using eqn  [ eqn : ha1 ] .",
    "the fermilab group report a final result @xmath67 where the first error is statistical and fitting and the second systematic , resulting from matching lattice gauge theory and hqet to qcd , lattice spacing dependence , light quark mass dependence and the quenched approximation .",
    "the bulk of the matching cancels in the double ratios and the remaining short - distance coefficients that match lattice gauge theory to qcd and hqet to qcd are small and are calculated at one - loop level in perturbation theory .",
    "lattice spacing dependence is studied using three lattices in the range @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath66 is extrapolated linearly in @xmath69 to the chiral limit , showing a downward trend .",
    "the quoted uncertainty is a result of including nonlinear terms present in the chiral expansion .",
    "the chiral extrapolation is in fact the largest source of uncertainty .",
    "finally the error due to quenching is estimated by summing the effect on the running coupling , @xmath70 and allowing an additional @xmath71 uncertainty .",
    "this is a precision calculation of a phenomenologically interesting quantity .",

    "a new method to determine the @xmath8 quark mass with nonperturbative accuracy was presented by sommer  @xcite .",

    "i estimate an average of these calculations to be @xmath75 .",
    "in this section i will focus on one quantity : the hyperfine splitting in both heavy - light and quarkonia systems .",
    "lattice calculations of spectroscopic quantities are generally better controlled than matrix element calculations of similar scope .",
    "a major advantage is that no renormalisation is required .",
    "however , the hyperfine splitting ( hfs ) remains an exception to this rule .",
    "in the heavy - light sector it is experimentally observed that the value of the hfs remains constant for all flavours . in practice , in the meson sector , lattice results are suppressed relative to experiment by as much as 20%(40% ) for @xmath1(@xmath0 ) mesons . at this conference tsutsui",
    "@xcite described a calculation of heavy quark expansion parameters using nrqcd which includes results for the heavy - light meson and baryon splittings .",
    "the meson splitting is @xmath76 below the experimental value as in other calculations while this discrepancy does not exist in the baryon splittings .",
    "it is argued that the discrepancy is a quenching effect since the meson splitting is proportional to the wavefunction at the orgin which is suppressed in the quenched approximation and to the strong coupling which runs differently in the full and quenched theories .",
    "this however , has not been verified by an unquenched calculation of these splittings .",
    "lewis  @xcite presented results for the charmed baryon spectrum ( both @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) using anisotropic and nrqcd actions . despite larger statistical errors than in the meson spectrum they see no suppression of the hfs",
    "in fact there may be evidence that it is overestimated although better data are required to make a conclusive statement .",
    "turning to the charmonium and bottomonium spectra .",
    "garcia - perez reported preliminary results on behalf of the qcdtaro collaboration  @xcite .",
    "they have calculated the hfs on a very fine lattice , @xmath79 , using the sw action .",
    "they take the continuum limit using ukqcd data at @xmath80 and observe significant lattice spacing dependence .",
    "they are currently producing their own configurations at a range of @xmath81 values to make a more consistent continuum extrapolation .",
    "new results for the bottomonium spectrum and hfs were presented by manke  @xcite .",
    "the calculation is done with an anisotropic relativistic heavy quark action .",
    "two levels of anisotropy are used in the quenched approximation .",
    "they also find significant scaling violations .",
    "lattice calculations offer the prospect of model - independent determinations of hadronic matrix elements .",
    "the effect of unquenching in calculations of leptonic decay constants and their ratios is becoming more precise .",
    "for the semileptonic decay @xmath9 control of the systematic errors in the quenched approximation has improved .",
    "problems remain however , including simulations with pion momentum above 1gev , the chiral extrapolation and unquenching .",
    "an important development is the lattice determination of the zero - recoil form factor for @xmath10 .",
    "the calculation is systematically improvable and with this method it is conceivable that the error on @xmath82 can be lowered to under @xmath83 .",
