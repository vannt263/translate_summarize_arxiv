    "although it is well known that the wavelike phenomena of classical physics are ruled by hyperbolic equations , there are at least two modern motivations for studying the scalar wave equation on curved lorentzian four - manifolds .",

    "sets @xmath5 with locally finite @xmath6 curvature and locally finite @xmath6 norm of the first covariant derivatives of @xmath4 .",
    "this means that the spacetime constructed by evolution from smooth data can be smoothly continued , together with a time foliation , as long as the curvature of the foliation and the first covariant derivatives of its extrinsic curvature remain @xmath6-bounded on the leaves of the foliation @xcite .",
    "the proof that this is indeed the case relies on a number of technical ingredients , including the construction of a parametrix ( an approximate green function of the wave operator , that provides a progressive wave representation @xcite for solutions of the wave equation ) for solutions of the homogeneous wave equation @xmath7 on a fixed einstein vacuum background .",
    "one has then to obtain control of the parametrix and of its error term by using only the fact that the curvature tensor is bounded in @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "note that , at a deeper level , the metric @xmath2 can be viewed to determine the elliptic or hyperbolic nature is a connected , four - dimensional , hausdorff four - manifold of class @xmath8 , a linear partial differential operator is a linear map @xmath9 with coefficients @xmath10 given by functions of class @xmath11 .",

    "the operator @xmath12 is said to be hyperbolic at @xmath16 if there exists a domain @xmath19 , a convex open cone in @xmath17 , such that every line through @xmath20 cuts the characteristic cone in @xmath21 real distinct points . in particular , second - order differential operators with higher - order terms @xmath22 are hyperbolic at @xmath16 if and only if the cone defined by @xmath23 is convex , i.e. , if the quadratic form @xmath24 has signature @xmath25 .",

    "note also that , in four - dimensional manifolds , our lorentzian world lies in between two other options , i.e. a riemannian metric @xmath2 with signature @xmath28 and elliptic operator @xmath29 , and a ultrahyperbolic metric @xmath2 with signature @xmath30 and ultrahyperbolic operator @xmath29 . in the so - called euclidean ( or riemannian )",

    "its leading symbol is therefore clifford multiplication , and it generates all elliptic symbols on compact riemannian manifolds @xcite .",
    "this reflects the better known property according to which , out of the dirac operator and its ( formal ) adjoint , one can define two operators of laplace type , as well as powers of these operators . 0.3 cm ( ii ) recent work on the self - dual road to noncommutative gravity with twist has found it useful to start from a classical , undeformed spacetime which is a self - dual solution of the vacuum einstein equation , e.g. a kasner spacetime @xcite . within that framework , it is of interest to solve first the scalar wave equation in such a kasner background .",

    "<S> this is the parametrix construction that relies upon fourier - maslov integral operators , but with a novel perspective on the nonlinearities in the dispersion relation . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the adomian method for nonlinear partial differential equations is applied to generate a recursive scheme for the evaluation of the amplitude function in the parametrix . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting formulas can be used to build self - dual solutions to the field equations of noncommutative gravity , as has been shown in the recent literature . </S>"
