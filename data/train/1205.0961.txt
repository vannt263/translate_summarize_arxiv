    "the decimal expansion of real numbers like @xmath4 , @xmath5 or @xmath3 appears to be quite mysterious and , for a long time , has baffled mathematicians . while numerical observations seem to speak in favour of a complex structure , most questions one may imagine to ask about the decimal expansion of classical irrational constants turn out to be out of reach .",
    "kontsevitch and zagier @xcite offered a promising framework to try to distinguish usual constants from other real numbers by introducing the notions of _ period _ and of _ exponential period_. algebraic numbers , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are periods , while @xmath3 is conjecturally not a period .",
    "however , @xmath3 is a typical example of an exponential period .",
    "exponential periods form a countable set that contains the set of periods .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for exact definitions and more results about both notions , but to paraphrase these authors , all classical contants are periods in an appropriate sense .",
    "folklore suggests that all irrational periods are _ normal numbers_. recall that a real number is a normal number if for every integer @xmath1 and every positive integer @xmath8 , each one of the @xmath9 blocks of length @xmath8 over the alphabet @xmath10 occurs in its base @xmath0 expansion with frequency @xmath11 .",
    "this notion was introduced in 1909 by borel @xcite who proved that almost all numbers , with respect to the lebesgue measure , are normal despite the uncomfortable fact that not a single natural example of a normal number is known .",
    "an interesting ( and perhaps more reasonable ) way to tackle problems concerned with the expansions of classical constants in integer bases is to consider the _",
    "subword complexity _ of real numbers .",
    "let @xmath12 be a real number and @xmath1 be a positive integer .",
    "then @xmath12 has a unique expansion in the base @xmath0 , that is , there exists a unique sequence @xmath13 with values in @xmath14 such that @xmath15 the complexity function of @xmath12 with respect to the base @xmath0 is the function that associates with each positive integer @xmath8 the positive integer @xmath16 a normal number thus has the maximum possible complexity in every integer base , that is , @xmath17 for every positive integer @xmath8 and every integer @xmath1 . as mentioned before",
    ", one usually expects such a high complexity for numbers like @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath3 .",
    "this problem was first addressed in 1938 by hedlund and morse @xcite",
    ".    in their paper , hedlund and morse obtained a fundamental result that can be restated as follows .    * _ theorem hm .",
    "_ *  _ let @xmath1 be an integer and @xmath12 be a real number .",
    "then @xmath12 is rational if and only if it has a bounded complexity function .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath12 is irrational , its complexity function is increasing and thus @xmath18 _    to find lower bounds for the complexity function of algebraic irrational numbers is a challenging problem . in 1997 ,",
    "ferenczi and mauduit @xcite proved the theorem below .",
    "actually , their result is slightly weaker and the present statement is given according to a clever remark of allouche outlined in @xcite .    * _ theorem fm . _ *  _ let @xmath19 be an integer and @xmath12 be an algebraic irrational number .",
    "then , @xmath20 _    the proof of theorem fm mixes techniques from combinatorics on words and diophantine approximation .",
    "the main ingredient is a @xmath21-adic version of roth s theorem due to ridout @xcite .",
    "recently , bugeaud and the author @xcite ( see also @xcite ) improved theorem fm by means of the schmidt subspace theorem . under the same assumption , these authors proved that ( [ bfm ] ) can be replaced by @xmath22    the situation regarding transcendental constants is even worse : apparently , there is not a single trancendental exponential period for which one knows an improvement of the lower bound given by theorem hm .",
    "of course , one could choose an exponential period @xmath12 and compute the first digits of its base-@xmath0 expansion .",
    "if one is lucky enough , one will find occurrences of many different blocks of digits of a given length .",
    "but , this would only lead , for some integer @xmath23 , to a lower bound of the type @xmath24 for all sufficiently large positive integers @xmath8 .    recall that the _ irrationality exponent _ of an irrational number @xmath12 , denoted by @xmath25 , is defined as the supremum of the real numbers @xmath26 for which the inequality @xmath27 has infinitely many different rational solutions @xmath28",
    ". it always satifies @xmath29 the set of real numbers whose irrationality exponent is equal to @xmath2 has full lebesgue measure . by roth s theorem @xcite ,",
    "algebraic irrational numbers all have an irrationality exponent equal to @xmath2 .",
    "the aim of this note is to generalize theorem fm as follows .",
    "[ main ] let @xmath1 be an integer and @xmath12 be an irrational real number such that @xmath30 .",
    "then , @xmath31    our proof of theorem [ main ] is essentially a combination of known results that rely on fine combinatorial properties of infinite words with a very low complexity . in particular , we use , in an essential way , a result due to berth , holton and zamboni @xcite concerning initial repetitions occurring in sturmian words .",
    "we derive the following consequences of theorem [ main ] .",
    "[ e ] for every integer @xmath1 , the number @xmath3 satisfies ( [ complex ] ) .    to our knowledge , this is the first example of a transcendental exponential period for which we can improve the bound of theorem hm .",
    "the only property of the number @xmath3 used in the proof of corollary [ e ] is that @xmath32 , which follows from euler s formula for the continued fraction expansion of @xmath3 ( see the proof of corollary [ e ] in section [ proofe ] ) .",
    "actually , many other examples of numbers involving the exponential function , trigonometric functions , or the modified bessel function at rational arguments also have an irrationality exponent equal to @xmath2 . in particular",
    ", the same conclusion holds in corollary [ e ] , if we replace the number @xmath3 by any of the following numbers ( see @xcite ) : @xmath33 other interesting values covered by our approach are the numbers @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the bessel function of the first kind and @xmath36 denotes the modified ( or hyperbolic ) bessel function of the first kind ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , multiplying any of these numbers by a nonzero rational and then adding a rational leads to a new example for which our result can be applied .",
    "we can also take the natural action of @xmath37 on any of these numbers .",
    "that is , starting from one of the above number @xmath12 , the number @xmath38 , where @xmath39 , also satisfies the bound ( [ complex ] ) of theorem [ main ] .",
    "another consequence of our theorem [ main ] is that a real number with a bounded sequence of partial quotients in its continued fraction expansion can not have base-@xmath0 expansions that are too simple .",
    "[ bad ] let @xmath1 be an integer and @xmath12 be an irrational real number whose continued fraction expansion is @xmath40 $ ]",
    ". if the sequence of integers @xmath41 is bounded , then @xmath12 satisfies ( [ complex ] ) .",
    "we first introduce some notation from combinatorics on words .",
    "let @xmath42 be a finite set .",
    "the length of a word @xmath43 on the alphabet @xmath42 , that is , the number of letters composing @xmath43 , is denoted by @xmath44 . if @xmath45 is a letter and @xmath43 a finite word , then @xmath46 denotes the number of occurrences of the letter @xmath45 in @xmath43 . for any positive integer @xmath23 , we write @xmath47 for the word @xmath48 ( the concatenation of the word @xmath43 repeated @xmath23 times ) . more generally , for any positive real number @xmath49 , @xmath50 denotes the word @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the prefix of @xmath43 of length @xmath53 . here ,",
    "@xmath54 and @xmath55 denote the floor and ceiling functions , respectively .",
    "we now consider two exponents that measure repetitions occurring in infinite words .",
    "they were introduced in @xcite and @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , respectively .",
    "the first exponent , the _ initial critical exponent _ of an infinite word @xmath56 , is defined as the supremum of all positive real numbers @xmath26 for which there exist arbitrarily long prefixes @xmath57 such that @xmath58 is also a prefix of @xmath56 .",
    "the second exponent , the _ diophantine exponent _ of an infinite word @xmath56 , is defined as the supremum of the real numbers @xmath26 for which there exist arbitrarily long prefixes of @xmath56 that can be factorized as @xmath59 , where @xmath60 and @xmath57 are two finite words ( @xmath60 possibly empty ) and @xmath61 is a real number such that @xmath62    the initial critical exponent and the diophantine exponent of @xmath56 are respectively denoted by @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "both exponents are clearly related by the following relation @xmath65    recall that the subword complexity function of an infinite word @xmath66 is the function that associates with each positive integer @xmath8 the positive integer @xmath67    we now prove the following result .",
    "[ prop ] let @xmath56 be an infinite word such that the difference @xmath68 is bounded .",
    "then @xmath69    our first step is a reduction argument that was previously outlined by allouche in a similar context @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we are going to prove that it is sufficient for our purpose to focus on the diophantine exponent of sturmian words .",
    "sturmian words are defined as the binary words @xmath70 for which @xmath71 for every positive integer @xmath8 .",
    "recall that the set of sturmian words is uncountable .    from now on ,",
    "we fix an infinite word @xmath72 defined over a finite alphabet @xmath42 and such that the difference @xmath73 is bounded .",
    "if @xmath56 is eventually periodic , it is easily checked that @xmath64 is infinite .",
    "we can thus assume that @xmath56 is aperiodic .",
    "theorem hm thus implies that the subword complexity function of @xmath56 is increasing .",
    "consequently , the difference @xmath73 is a nondecreasing sequence of bounded integers .",
    "such sequence is eventually constant and there thus exists two positive integers @xmath23 and @xmath74 such that @xmath75 by a result of cassaigne @xcite , an infinite word @xmath56 satisfies equality ( [ quasisturm ] ) if and only if there exist a finite word @xmath43 , a sturmian infinite word @xmath70 defined over @xmath76 and a nonerasing morphism @xmath77 from the free monoid @xmath76 into @xmath78 such that @xmath79 our infinite word @xmath56 thus has such a decomposition and we claim that @xmath80 set @xmath81 . to prove that ( [ sturm ] ) holds ,",
    "we only need a classical property of sturmian words : each of the two letters occurring in a sturmian word has a frequency .",
    "this means that there exists a real number @xmath82 in @xmath83 such that @xmath84 and consequently , @xmath85 the number @xmath82 is always irrational and is termed the slope of @xmath70 .",
    "it follows that @xmath86 where @xmath87 . here and in the sequel",
    ", @xmath88 stands for the usual landau notation .",
    "now , let us assume that @xmath89 for some positive real number @xmath26 , and let @xmath90 be a positive real number",
    ". by definition of the diophantine exponent , there exists an infinite sequence of prefixes of @xmath70 that can be factorized as @xmath91 , with @xmath92 and such that the sequence @xmath93 increases .",
    "we then infer from ( [ decomp ] ) that @xmath56 begins with the word @xmath94 set @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "there thus exists a positive real number @xmath97 such that @xmath98 since @xmath99 can be chosen arbitrarily large , we infer from equality ( [ o ] ) that @xmath100 and @xmath101 consequently , @xmath102 for every @xmath8 large enough .",
    "this shows that @xmath103 as desired .",
    "we have now to distinguish two cases depending on the diophantine properties of the slope @xmath82 of the sturmian words @xmath70 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath104 $ ] the continued fraction expansion of @xmath82 .",
    "first , let us assume that @xmath82 has a bounded sequence of partial quotients , say bounded by a positive integer @xmath105 .",
    "then there are only a finite number of distinct pairs @xmath106 and _ a fortiori _ of distinct triples @xmath107 . by the pigeonhole principle , there exist either a pair of integers @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , such that @xmath111 for infinitely many indices @xmath112 , or there exist infinitely many indices @xmath112 such that @xmath113 . in all cases",
    ", mixing propositions 5.1 and 5.2 of @xcite we get that @xmath114 we thus infer from inequality ( [ icedio ] ) that @xmath115    on the other hand , if @xmath82 has an unbounded sequence of partial quotients , it is shown in proposition 11.1 of @xcite that @xmath116    to sum up , ( [ dio ] ) , ( [ dio2 ] ) and ( [ dio1 ] ) give @xmath117 concluding the proof .",
    "we now briefly recall some interplay between the diophantine exponent and the irrationality exponent that can be found in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath12 be a real number whose base-@xmath0 expansion is @xmath118 .",
    "set @xmath66 .",
    "then the diophantine exponent of @xmath56 and the irrationality exponent of @xmath12 are linked by the following inequality : @xmath119 indeed , let us assume that the word @xmath56 begins with a prefix of the form @xmath59 .",
    "set @xmath120 .",
    "a simple computation shows that there exists an integer @xmath21 such that @xmath121 since @xmath12 and @xmath28 have the same first @xmath122 digits , we obtain that @xmath123 and thus @xmath124 where @xmath125 .",
    "we do not claim here that @xmath28 is written in lowest terms .",
    "actually , it may well happen that the @xmath126 of @xmath21 and @xmath127 is quite large but ( [ min ] ) still holds in that case .",
    "inequality ( [ diorat ] ) then follows directly from the definition of both exponents .",
    "we are now ready to conclude the proof of our main results .",
    "it is a straightforward consequence of proposition [ prop ] and inequality ( [ diorat ] ) .",
    "it is known after euler that the continued fraction expansion of @xmath3 has very special patterns ; namely @xmath128.\\ ] ] from euler s formula , we can easily derive that the irrationality exponent of @xmath3 satisfies @xmath129 , concluding the proof .",
    "indeed , if @xmath130 and @xmath131 respectively denote the @xmath8-th convergent and the @xmath8-th partial quotient of a real number @xmath12 , the theory of continued fractions ensures that @xmath132    a basic result from the theory of continued fractions ensures that @xmath30 when @xmath12 has a bounded sequence of partial quotients in its continued fraction expansion ( see for instance @xcite , theorem 23 , page 36 ) .",
    "we end this note with few comments .",
    "[ fema ] as already mentioned , the main ingredient in the proof of theorem fm is a @xmath21-adic version of roth s theorem due to ridout .",
    "incidentally , our proof of theorem [ main ] provides a new proof of theorem fm .",
    "in particular , this shows that it can be obtained with the use of roth s theorem only .",
    "that is , @xmath21-adic considerations are unnecessary to prove theorem fm .    however , the use of some @xmath21-adic information by ferenczi and mauduit in @xcite turned out to be of great importance since it led to the main lower bound for the complexity of algebraic irrational numbers obtained in @xcite .",
    "it is likely that proposition [ prop ] could be improved to @xmath133 this result would be optimal since the bound is reached for the fibonacci word , which is the most famous example among sturmian words .",
    "we note that , as a consequence of irrationality measures obtained by baker in @xcite , inequality ( [ dioconj ] ) would permit us to show that the conclusion of corollary [ e ] still holds if we replace the number @xmath3 by @xmath134 , for every integer @xmath135 .",
    "however , our approach would not permit us to deduce a new lower bound for the complexity of expansions in integer bases of periods like @xmath5 , @xmath6 or @xmath7 from ( [ dioconj ] ) since the best known upper bounds for the irrationality exponent of these numbers are all larger than @xmath136 .    as a limitation of our approach",
    ", we quote that there are real numbers with a low complexity in some integer base but with an irrationality exponent equal to @xmath2 .",
