    "the formation of bulges , which are the high density central component of spiral galaxies , is a key process in the formation of spiral galaxies .",
    "there are several scenarios for the formation process of the bulges ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "such scenarios can be divided into the following categories ; ( 1 ) a primordial collapse ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ( 2 ) merging of sub - clumps in a proto - galactic cloud ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ( 3 ) a secular evolution of a stellar disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "previously , the surface brightness of the bulges has been recognized to have the @xmath1 profile as in ellipticals , where @xmath2 denotes the distance from the center ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , recent observations have revealed the presence of a class of bulges that are well fitted by the exponential profile ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , i.e. , there exist two classes of bulges according to the surface brightness .",
    "each formation scenario has advantage and disadvantage to explain the diversity of bulges @xcite .    for the formation of the galactic bulge ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite have constructed one - zone chemical evolution models as follows : ( 1 ) they assumed that the galactic bulge was formed by a single star - burst . in their best fit model ,",
    "the formation time scale is @xmath0 0.1 gyr .",
    "( 2 ) one of the predictions of their calculations is that the element ratio such as [ o / fe ] remains high even for metal - rich stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath3 0 ) because the formation time scale of the bulge is shorter than the lifetime of a type ia supernova progenitor .",
    "however , the chemical properties predicted by the one - zone model depend strongly on their _ assumption _ of the dynamics , i.e. , the formation time - scale of the bulge . to constrain the formation scenarios ,",
    "we need to calculate the chemical and dynamical evolution together and compare the model predictions with both the chemical and kinematic properties of the bulge .    here , we present our first results of the three - dimensional galactic bulge formation model .",
    "we model the formation of the galaxy by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) method @xcite that incorporates a star formation algorithm and a self - consistent treatment of the chemical enrichment history of gas .",
    "the three - dimensional models for the formation of disk galaxies have been investigated by many authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and they have succeeded in many respects . we follow the method and models by the previous authors but use much larger number of particles to study the detailed formation and evolution processes of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "in cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology , the early stage of the formation of galaxies involves the progressive merging of sub - galactic clumps ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to properly model the dynamics of the merger history , we adopt the three - dimensional sph method",
    "the chemodynamical approach by @xcite , which is a mesh based and two - dimensional method , is not suitable to model the early merging history of the proto - galaxy .",
    "our sph code uses the grape @xcite and the remote - grape system @xcite to compute the gravitational interaction between particles ( grape - sph code ) .",
    "the adoption of the remote - grape system doubles the performance of our code since we can make the sph calculation and n - body summation in parallel @xcite .",
    "this enhancement of performance enables us to use seven times larger number of particles than @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite so that the spatial resolution of our model is almost two times higher than their models . as a result",
    ", we can investigate the early merging history in much more detail during the galaxy formation .",
    "we note that other authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have published the comparable or even higher resolution sph galaxy formation models than the present work ; however , these authors have mainly concentrated on the kinematic properties of the models .",
    "in contrast , in the present work , we have made attention to both the chemical and kinematic properties .",
    "our study is the first attempt to model the formation and chemical evolution of the galactic bulge using the self - consistent three - dimensional sph method . using the chemical and dynamical sph code",
    ", we simulate the evolution of the galaxy starting from a plausible cosmological initial condition .",
    "the obtained model well reproduces the important chemical and kinematic properties of the galaxy such as the formation of the bulge , disk and halo as seen in figure [ 3comp ] . by analyzing the result of this model",
    ", we construct a plausible scenario for the galactic bulge formation .",
    "the plan for the present paper is as follows : in section 2 , we briefly describe our sph method .",
    "section 3 describes the procedure to construct initial conditions .",
    "we present a summary of results obtained with our model in section 4 . by analyzing the result of our galaxy model",
    ", we describe the formation history of the bulge component in section 5 , and compare the chemical and kinematic properties of the bulge with recent observational results .",
    "finally , section 6 is devoted to conclusions .",
    "we adopt the sph method to construct self - consistent three - dimensional dynamical and chemical models for the formation of stellar systems .",
    "the sph method has been applied to many astrophysical problems .",
    "because of its lagrangian nature , it is suitable to systems that have large density contrasts , e.g. , the formation of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the evolution of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the cosmological simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a cloud - cloud collision ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "various codes have been developed to combine sph and n - body systems . in these codes ,",
    "gravitational forces are calculated with various methods such as direct summations , particle - particle / particle - mesh methods ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , tree methods ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the method to use the special purpose computer grape ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "to simulate the formation of a stellar system from gas , we use our grape - sph code using the remote - grape library @xcite . the sph formulation that we use",
    "is the same as @xcite .",
    "we use a spatially variable smoothing length and integrate equations of motion with a second order runge - kutta method as described in @xcite . to simulate the formation of stellar systems from gas , our grape - sph code includes various physical processes related to the formation of stellar systems , e.g. , cooling , star formation , and feedback by stars as follows .",
    "we adopt the metallicity dependent cooling functions , which are computed by mappings iii package by r.s .",
    "sutherland ( mappings iii is the successor of mappings ii described in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to solve the energy equation of gas particles ( see figure 1 of @xcite for the actually used cooling functions )    for the star formation algorithm , we adopt the star formation recipe as used in the usual sph codes @xcite .",
    "hereafter , `` star '' means `` star particle '' , which is not an individual star but an association of many stars . in this recipe",
    ", we convert a fraction of a gas particle into a star when four conditions are satisfied .",
    "the first three conditions are the _ physical _ conditions expressed as @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are the cooling time , dynamical time , and sound crossing time of the gas particle , respectively ( see @xcite for the detailed time scale definition ) .    during each star formation interval ( @xmath10 myr in the present work ) , we check whether the three conditions are satisfied for each gas particle .",
    "if the gas particle satisfies these three conditions , we then check the forth _ probability _",
    "assuming star formation process is a poisson process @xcite , we can write the probability for star formation within @xmath11 as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the local star formation time scale . in our sph code , we define @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a parameter to control our star formation recipe .",
    "if @xmath16 is larger than a random number @xmath17 , we create a new star from a fraction of the gas particle ( star formation occurs ! ) .",
    "introducing this _ probability _ condition , we can effectively control the threshold density for star formation by changing the parameter @xmath15 .",
    "we compute @xmath16 as a function of the density ( @xmath18 ) for different values of @xmath15 as shown in figure [ sf_prob ] . here",
    ", we assume @xmath19 2 myr .",
    "note that the timestep used in the time integration is always smaller than @xmath11 . from figure [ sf_prob ]",
    ", we can see effects of @xmath15 as follows ; larger ( smaller ) @xmath15 means lower ( higher ) threshold density .    to demonstrate the dependence on the star formation parameter @xmath15",
    ", we evolve a spherical region of 10@xmath20 @xmath21 , which consists of 10 % gas and 90 % dark matter , for various @xmath15 .",
    "initially , we set up the sphere in rigid rotation and outward expansion .",
    "and the angular speed of rotation corresponds to the spin parameter @xmath22 0.05 , where @xmath23 , with @xmath24 being the angular momentum , @xmath25 the total energy , m the mass , and @xmath26 the gravitational constant @xcite .",
    "this initial condition is the same as used in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we evolve the sphere for three different star formation parameters @xmath27 0.1 , 0.5 and 1.0 . in figure",

    "there is a clear correlation between @xmath15 and the ratio between the x and z axis velocity - dispersion ( or the spin parameter ) . from these results ,",
    "we conclude that the @xmath27 0.1 and @xmath27 1.0 galaxies are similar to late type and early type galaxies , respectively . to summarize , if we use this _ probability _ condition , various values of @xmath15 lead to various global star formation histories .",

    "the typical mass of stars is @xmath32 @xmath21 .",
    "formed stars eject energy and mass as stellar winds and supernova explosions ( feedback from stars ) . as a result , stars heat up , accelerate , and enrich the circumstellar and interstellar medium . with current computing resources ,",
    "it is not yet feasible to accurately include the energy , momentum , and mass feedback from stars in our sph code .",
    "this is because the length resolution of the present calculation ( @xmath33 kpc ) is much longer than a typical size of supernova remnants ( @xmath34 pc ) .",
    "thus , in the present paper , we adopt a phenomenological method as adopted by several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to mimic real feedback processes ; i.e. , we distribute the energy and mass ejected by a star to the neighbor gas particles . in our sph code",

    "we compute the mass and energy ejection rates based on a simple model explained below . in this paper , we distribute the feedback energy as purely thermal energy .",

    "to summarize , our grape - sph code is a most up - to - date sph implementation for the formation of stellar systems and used to successfully model the formation of globular clusters @xcite .",

    "the weakness of this method is that we have to use the isolated boundary condition .",
    "namely , we neglect the external tidal field and artificially add the angular momentum to the initial velocity field . on the other hand , with the method ( 2 ) ,",

    "the reason is that in sph models including star formation recipes , the resolution of the model becomes worse and worse during the evolution since the number of gas particles decreases . with our chemical enrichment model , we need to have a large enough number of gas particles around a star particle to properly model the chemical evolution of the interstellar matter ; further , the gas particles show a more extended distribution than the star particles and this distribution makes the effective resolution of the chemical enrichment description worse . at @xmath103 0.9 ,",
    "the number of gas particles becomes @xmath0 13,300 , which is a half of the initial number of gas particles and sufficiently large .",
    "figure [ star_sff ] shows the sfr as a function of time for the bulge stars ( solid line ) and all stars ( dotted line ) up to @xmath103 0.9 . in this figure",
    ", we normalize the sfr by the total mass of each component at @xmath103 0.9 .",
    "more than 60 % of the bulge stars up to this time formed during the first 0.5 gyr of the evolution . with our model , we can obtain the detailed formation history of the bulge stars . in figure [ bulge_p ] , we present snap shots for projected star positions in the region where star formation is most violent for the first 0.5 gyr .",
    "we note that the merging of two sub - galactic clumps occurs during @xmath28 0.4 - 0.5 gyr .",
    "this merging of the clumps causes the star burst of the short time scale shown in figure [ star_sff ] .",
    "such a phenomenon is different from the simple star burst assumed in the one - zone chemical evolution model @xcite .    with our chemical and dynamical model",
    ", we can also obtain the kinematics of the bulge stars . in figure [ bulge_vel ] , we plot the average velocity ( upper line ) and the velocity dispersion ( lower line ) of these bulge stars .",
    "the bulge stars are substantially rotationally supported with the rotational speeds of @xmath0 160 - 230 km s@xmath97 .",
    "these speeds are smaller than the rotational speeds of the disk stars ( @xmath0 270 km s@xmath97 in the present model ) , which means that the angular momentum of the bulge is lost during the merging process .",
    "figure [ bulge_dis ] shows the x - direction velocity dispersion for the bulge stars as a function of [ fe / h ] . here",
    ", our numerical results are shown by the solid triangles and solid squares and compared with observational data @xcite shown by the doted circles ( note that the observational data is the line of sight velocity dispersion ) .",
    "the solid squares are the stars with @xmath126 gyr ( old stars ) and the solid triangles are the stars with @xmath127 gyr ( young stars ) .",
    "the old and young stars show a different trend , and the result for old stars is more consistent with the observational data .",
    "our model ( especially old stars ) qualitatively reproduces the kinematic properties of the galactic bulge .",
    "important information to constrain the formation of the galactic bulge concerns the chemical properties of the bulge stars . in this subsection",
    ", we analyze the chemical properties of the bulge stars .",
    "the observed metallicity distribution function of k - giant stars @xcite is characterized by a wide ( @xmath128 [ fe / h ] @xmath129 ) distribution as shown by the dashed line in figure [ bulge_mdist ] .",
    "the distribution function of the bulge stars in our model ( the solid line in figure [ bulge_mdist ] ) is as wide as @xmath130 [ fe / h ] @xmath131 , being in good agreement with the observational data .",
    "as noted in the previous subsection , about 60 % of the bulge stars form in the strong star - burst caused by merging of sub - clumps ( hereafter these stars are called a merger component ) .",
    "this merger - driven star - burst is partly responsible for this wide distribution . on the other hand",
    ", other 40 % of the bulge stars form in the late stage of evolution ( a non - merger component ) and also contribute to widen the distribution function .",
    "this is because the non - merger component of the bulge stars has much larger [ fe / h ] than the merger component as explained below .",
    "the bulge stars can be divided into two chemically different types with and without being contaminated by type ia supernova ejecta . with the adopted progenitor model @xcite , the epoch of the first appearance of type ia supernovae @xmath132 0.5 gyr after the formation of each star .",
    "thus , the stars that formed after @xmath28 0.5 gyr are partially contaminated by type ia supernovae . each type ia supernova",
    "ejects @xmath133 times more iron than a type ii supernova @xcite . as a result ,",
    "iron contained in the non - merger component of the bulge stars partially originates from type ia supernovae and their [ fe / h ] tends to be higher than that of the merger component . in figure [ bulge_time ] ,",
    "the distribution function of the stars that formed before and after @xmath28 0.5 gyr are plotted by the dashed and dotted lines , respectively , along with the total distribution function of the bulge stars ( solid line ) . both dashed and dotted lines show rather wide distribution and clearly the peak value of each distribution is different .",
    "the very old stars , which form before @xmath28 0.5 gyr , contribute mainly to the metal poor range of the distribution .",
    "the adopted yields are [ o / fe ] @xmath53 0.4 from type ii supernovae and [ o / fe ] @xmath134 from type ia supernovae ( table [ yield ] ) .",
    "thus the contamination by type ia supernovae ejecta decreases [ o / fe ] in stars starting from [ o / fe ] @xmath135 . in figure",
    "[ bulge_o_fe ] , we present the metallicity distribution function of the bulge stars for [ o / fe ] .",
    "the very peaky distribution shows that a half of the bulge stars have [ o / fe ] @xmath136 , i.e. a half of the bulge stars are not contaminated by type ia supernovae . also , almost 80 % of the bulge stars have [ o / fe ] @xmath115 .",
    "figure [ bulge_o_fe_obs ] shows [ o / fe ] as a function of [ fe / h ] for the bulge stars .",
    "[ fe / h ] increases up to @xmath137 without type ia supernova contamination .",
    "later , due to the increasing fe enrichment by type ia supernovae , [ o / fe ] decreases down to @xmath138 as [ fe / h ] increases to @xmath139 .",
    "we note for a given [ fe / h ] ( @xmath140 ) , [ o / fe ] is distributed over a wide range of @xmath141 .",
    "thus , even for [ fe / h ] @xmath115 , large fraction of the bulge stars have [ o / fe ] @xmath115 , while [ o / fe ] is mostly sub - solar for [ fe / h ] @xmath142 .",
    "these features of our model are consistent with the observed results as plotted in figure [ bulge_o_fe_obs ] by the dotted circles @xcite .",
    "the observed [ si / fe ] and [ ca / fe ] show also relatively large dispersion from @xmath143 to @xmath144 for [ fe / h ] @xmath115 , although the observed results are still preliminary @xcite .    in contrast , @xcite argued that the metallicity of the bulge stars mainly originated from type ii supernovae . in their model , they assumed @xmath145 1 gyr and the star formation time scale is shorter than 1 gyr so that the majority of type ia supernovae have exploded long after the star formation .",
    "therefore the one - zone chemical evolution model predicts that the galactic bulge is a chemically single population .",
    "in contrast to this picture , our chemical and dynamical model predicts that the galactic bulge is neither a chemically single population and a dynamically single population .",
    "there are several problems in our numerical model .",
    "first , the present model , which is compared with some observational data , is just the current best - fit model from only 5 realizations .",
    "thus , the quantitative comparisons between our model and observation are still far from complete .",
    "one reason is that it is too difficult to find a consistent initial model for very good match to the observation before doing real calculations .",
    "due to complicated merging events occurring in the early phase , it is impossible to predict which initial halo will become a milky - way - like spiral galaxy .",
    "another point is the resolution of the numerical model . as seen in figure [ density ] ,",
    "the inner region of the present model is not well resolved .",
    "thus , our definition radius for the bulge , @xmath120 2 kpc , is not a clear definition when we compare our results with observational data .",
    "this is because the baade s window , where the chemical properties of the bulge stars are observed , is located 0.5 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "the choice of our definition is determined from the limitation of the numerical resolution of the present model .",
    "we use the rather large radius of 2 kpc to define the bulge stars since the gravitational softening length of the present model is 0.5 kpc ( in fact , the inspection of figure [ density ] shows that the effective resolution in our model is @xmath0 1 kpc , which equals to the softening length of the dark matter particles ) . to summaries , the number of particles in the present model is still too small to fully resolve the chemical structure of the bulge . to make more sensible comparison between numerical models and the observational data , we need much higher resolution models and more observational data obtained with large telescopes .",
    "although there is such limitation , our model is in a good agreement with chemical and kinematic properties of the galactic bulge stars .",
    "in this paper , we report on the result of our high resolution three - dimensional models of the galactic bulge formation . by modeling the formation and evolution of the galaxy ,",
    "we understand the formation history of the galactic bulge as follows .",
    "the early evolution of the best - fit model reveals that most bulge stars form during the merger that occurred in the region of the deepest potential . because of the strong star burst induced by the merger , the metallicity distribution of the bulge component becomes as wide as observed .",
    "although such a strong star burst was a similar effect as the burst assumed in the previous chemical evolution model , our model show that there is another reason to widen the metallicity distribution function of the bulge . by analyzing our results , we find that the bulge stars in our model are composed of two different components .",
    "one component ( merger component ) was produced by the merger occurred in the center of the halo as noted above .",
    "the other non - merger component was formed in the inner region of the disk after this merger . due to the different formation epoch",
    ", the main source of iron for each component is different .",
    "iron in the former comes mainly from type ii supernovae , and the other from type ia supernovae .",
    "since each type ia supernova ejects @xmath133 times more iron than a type ii supernova , [ fe / h ] of the non - merger component tends to be higher than that of the merger component , which widened the metallicity distribution function .",
    "also , our model predicts a relatively large dispersion in [ o / fe ] for [ fe / h ] @xmath115 .    although our model is not in a complete agreement with our galaxy , some chemical and kinematic properties of the galactic bulge , such as the velocity dispersion vs. metallicity , are well reproduced .",
    "we thus conclude that an old fraction of the galactic bulge is very likely to have been formed by the sub - clump merger in the proto - galactic environment , while a younger fraction of the galactic bulge has formed gradually in the inner disk .",
    "these two groups should show different chemical properties .",
    "we would like to thank the anonymous referee for the valuable comments and suggestions to greatly improve the manuscript .",
    "also , we would like to thank j. makino for kindly providing access to the grape-4 and grape-5 systems , on which a part of the computation has been done . some part of the computation has been performed with the grape cluster at the astronomical data analysis center of the national astronomical observatory , japan .",
