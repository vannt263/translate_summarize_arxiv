    "refraction causes the path of the radio signal to bend .",
    "this bending is described by the bending angle , @xmath18 , which is the angle between the asymptotes of the ray path entering and exiting the planetary environment .",
    "if the planetary environment is spherically symmetric , then the bending angle @xmath18 _ ( radians ) _ satisfies @xcite :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is radius from the center of the planet and subscripts indicate a specific ray path , which is usually equivalent to a specific time at the receiver .",
    "here we have adopted the convention of @xcite and @xcite that positive bending is away from the planet such that refraction in the neutral atmosphere leads to a negative bending angle @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite adopted the opposite convention .",
    "the impact parameter @xmath21 and closest approach distance @xmath20 are related by bouguer s rule , @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath10 varies exponentially with radial distance and has scale height @xmath23 , then @xmath18 satisfies @xcite :    @xmath24    the minus sign in this equation is not present in the corresponding equation in @xcite ( their equation 35 ) due to the sign convention for @xmath18 noted above .",
    "since the refracted ray path differs from what it would be in a vacuum , the rate of change of the length of the refracted ray path also differs from what it would be in a vacuum .",
    "this affects the doppler shift experienced by the radio signal .",
    "the frequency of the received radio signal differs from its vacuum value by the frequency residual , @xmath25 , which satisfies @xcite :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the component of the velocity of the transmitter relative to the receiver that is perpendicular to the ray path .",
    "this equation is commonly stated without emphasizing the sign of @xmath25 .",
    "a signed version of this equation is given in the appendix of @xcite ( their equation 30 ) .",
    "this shows that the frequency residual caused by refraction in the neutral atmosphere during ingress into an occultation is negative , whilst the corresponding egress residual is positive .",

    "the power of a radio signal is sensitive to the plasma density and neutral density along the ray path .",
    "several factors associated with the propagation of the radio signal through a planetary environment can reduce the received power .",

    "we concentrate on the strongest of these factors , defocusing . in a neutral atmosphere ,",
    "changes in the bending angle @xmath18 with impact parameter @xmath21 causes the beam to spread out , which reduces its intensity .",
    "we define @xmath28 as the ratio of the received intensity to the intensity that would have been received in the absence of refraction during the propagation of the radio signal through a planetary environment . @xmath28",

    ", @xmath28 is not necessarily positive and less than 1 .",
    "@xmath28 may be positive and greater than 1 , indicating an increase in intensity ( focusing ) . or @xmath28 may be negative , which indicates the presence of multipath effects in which multiple rays reach the receiver simultaneously .",
    "equation  [ eqn : defocusingloss01 ] can be used to relate the power of a radio signal to the plasma density or neutral density along the ray path .",
    "we consider jupiter as a test case to assess the significance of predicted changes in polarization angle , frequency , and power of radio emissions from a distant astrophysical radio source during an occultation of the radio source by a planet .",
    "a distinct advantage of occultation - based techniques is that effects caused by propagation through the interplanetary or interstellar medium can be eliminated by using pre- and post - occultation measurements as a baseline .",
    "consequently , we do not need to consider such effects here .",
    "_ however , effects caused by propagation through the terrestrial atmosphere and ionosphere vary on timescales short by comparison to the duration of an occultation .",
    "these effects must be removed by independent simultaneous observations of the terrestrial environment , which are routinely acquired at the nasa deep space network stations and other radio observatories . validated empirical models of the terrestrial environment are also available . _    for simplicity , we initially assume that all aspects of the planetary environment , including the atmosphere , ionosphere , and magnetosphere , are spherically symmetric and adopt an illustrative model of jupiter s environment .",
    "we assume that the neutral density in the atmosphere @xmath35 , where @xmath36 m@xmath16 , @xmath23 = 35 km , and 1 @xmath37 is the radius of jupiter to the 1 bar pressure level ( @xmath38 km ) @xcite .",
    "jupiter s neutral atmosphere is oblate , not spherical @xcite , but the assumption of spherical symmetry is reasonable for this exploratory work .",
    "the assumption of an isothermal atmosphere is also only weakly valid @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the assumed electron density in the ionosphere and magnetosphere @xmath39 on radial distance is more complicated . in the ionosphere , we assume that @xmath39 is a chapman function , @xmath40 where @xmath41 m@xmath16 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 = 1750 km above 1 @xmath37 , and @xmath44 = 350 km @xcite .",
    "the assumption of spherical symmetry is not realistic for the ionosphere , where densities vary with solar zenith angle .",
    "the assumed ionospheric structure is based on observations close to the terminator .",
    "we assume that the top of the ionosphere occurs where the electron density equals @xmath45 m@xmath16 , which is an altitude of 5300 km above 1 @xmath37 ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "since there are few observations of electron density between the top of the ionosphere and the inner boundary of the magnetosphere at 10 @xmath37 , we adopt a simple bridging function in which @xmath7 decreases exponentially with @xmath20 such that @xmath47 m@xmath16 at 10 @xmath37 . this corresponds to a scale height of @xmath48 km or about 4 @xmath37 . in the inner magnetosphere , which begins at 10 @xmath37 , @xmath7 decreases exponentially with @xmath20 with a scale height of 2.5 @xmath37 @xcite . in the outer magnetosphere",
    ", @xmath7 decreases exponentially with @xmath20 with a scale height of 40 @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the outer boundary of the magnetosphere occurs at 100 @xmath37 and an electron density of @xmath49 m@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the transition from the inner magnetosphere to the outer magnetosphere occurs where their respective electron density functions intersect , namely @xmath50 m@xmath16 and 28.6 @xmath37 .",
    "the assumption of spherical symmetry is not realistic for the magnetosphere .",
    "plasma in jupiter s middle and outer magnetosphere is largely confined to a plasma sheet of thickness @xmath51510 @xmath37 that lies near the equatorial plane @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the size of jupiter s magnetosphere is variable . the sunward distance to the outer boundary of the magnetosphere ranges from @xmath5160 to @xmath5190 @xmath37 and the terminator distance ranges from @xmath5190 to @xmath51130 @xmath37 , depending on ambient solar wind conditions @xcite .",
    "the tailward extent is discussed further in section  [ sec : pulsars ] .",
    "we assume that the component of the magnetic field parallel to the line of sight , @xmath52 , which influences faraday rotation of the plane of polarization , _ is independent of occultation geometry and equivalent to the magnitude of the magnetic field , @xmath53 .",
    "_    we assume that the magnetic field decreases exponentially from @xmath54 t at 1 @xmath37 to @xmath55 t at 20 @xmath37 @xcite , then decreases exponentially from @xmath55 t at 20 @xmath37 to @xmath56 t at 100 @xmath37 @xcite . the magnetic field strength at radial distances less than 20 @xmath37 is dominated by the planet s internal magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field strength at larger distances is significantly influenced by magnetospheric currents .",
    "the assumptions of spherically symmetric magnetic field strength and @xmath57 are convenient in that they ensure that the resultant faraday rotation depends only on the radial distance of closest approach , not any additional geographical considerations such as the latitude of closest approach or the direction of the ray path .",
    "however , these assumptions are not particularly well satisfied for jupiter s predominantly dipolar field .",
    "the modeled densities and field strength are shown in figure  [ fig : allinputs ] . radial distances between 1 @xmath37 and 100 @xmath37 are shown , where @xmath37 is the radius of jupiter to the 1 bar pressure level ( @xmath38 km ) .",
    "note that radio signals can propagate deeper into the planet than the 1 bar pressure level ( 1 @xmath37 ) , although these results are not shown .",
    "this model includes some gross simplifications , but it offers a reasonable representation of conditions near the terminator of jupiter given the assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "that is sufficient for the exploratory purposes of this work .",
    "we assume that @xmath27 = 17 km s@xmath58 to find the frequency shift ( equation  [ eqn : dfeqn01 ] ) and that @xmath30 = 5 au to find the power loss ( equation  [ eqn : defocusingloss01 ] ) .",
    "this speed @xmath27 is the difference between earth s 30 km s@xmath58 orbital speed and jupiter s 13 km s@xmath58 orbital speed , so we implicitly assume that the distant astrophysical radio source is at rest .",
    "_ smaller speeds and longer occultation durations are possible if jupiter is at opposition and in retrograde motion . _ with the assumed speed of 17 km s@xmath58 , the impact parameter @xmath21 changes by @xmath511 @xmath37 per hour .",
    "the impact parameter @xmath21 will pass through ionospheric and atmospheric altitudes on a timescale of minutes , which is amenable to observations .",
    "yet @xmath21 will pass through inner magnetospheric distances on timescales of tens of hours .",
    "due to earth s rotation , this timescale would preclude observations by a single ground - based observer and would require coordination across multiple observing sites .",
    "furthermore , since jupiter has a ten hour rotational period , the magnetospheric parts of an occultation will span multiple jupiter rotations .",
    "_ this has the potential to introduce significant complexity to the analysis of observations , as the assumption of spherical symmetry is flawed for the magnetosphere . _",
    "propagation through a planetary environment has frequency - dependent effects on the polarization angle , frequency , and power of a radio signal .",
    "we therefore consider multiple radio frequencies in this case study  0.1 , 1 , and 10 ghz .",
    "radio astronomers routinely observe astrophysical sources in this range of frequencies .",
    "_ for our chosen @xmath30 and @xmath6 , the fresnel zone size is 3000 km ( 0.1 ghz ) , 1000 km ( 1 ghz ) , and 300 km ( 10 ghz ) ( section  [ sec : power ] ) .",
    "this is the diffraction - limited vertical resolution that can be achieved using geometrical optics methods .",
    "existing wave optics methods of analysis can be used to improve the vertical resolution by an order of magnitude , thereby yielding sub - scale height resolution @xcite .",
    "_    polarization angle results are shown in figure  [ fig : intfaradayvslogr ] .",
    "faraday rotation is inversely proportional to the square of frequency ( equation  [ eqn : faraday01 ] ) .",
    "polarization angle changes in excess of 1 rad are present for 0.1 ghz ( 1 ghz ) radio signals that pass within 10 @xmath37 ( 3 @xmath37 ) of the center of the planet .",
    "these are caused by magnetospheric plasma .",
    "effects are larger for radio signals that pass through the ionosphere .",
    "they exceed 0.1 rad even at 10 ghz .",
    "these results use the idealized magnetic conditions described above .",
    "as previously stated , a more realistic model would decrease these idealized polarization angle changes by a factor of 0.2 .",
    "since the polarization angle can only be determined within the range 0@xmath59 radians , note that changes in excess of @xmath59 radians must be tracked by observing at high time resolution .",
    "frequency shift results are shown in figure  [ fig : deltafvslogr ] . as discussed in section",
    "[ sec : freq ] , the sign of the frequency residual changes between ingress and egress : egress is shown here .",
    "furthermore , this assumes a deep occultation in which the line of sight between the distant astrophysical radio source and earth is completely occulted by the planet at the center of the occultation .",
    "behavior around the center of a `` grazing '' occultation , such as an occultation in which the closest approach distance never drops below 2 @xmath37 , is more complex , as is clear from the requirement that the sign of the frequency residual change from ingress to egress .",
    "the simplest explanation is that the velocity component @xmath27 in equation  [ eqn : dfeqn01 ] , which is the proportionality relationship between the frequency residual and the bending angle , is zero at the center of the occultation .",
    "further details are available in appendix a of @xcite .",
    "returning to figure  [ fig : deltafvslogr ] and the case of a deep occultation , magnetospheric plasma causes the frequency shift in the 0.1 ghz radio signal to exceed @xmath60 hz ( 1 part in @xmath61 ) for distances less than 10 @xmath37 . at the ionospheric peak ,",
    "the frequency shift in the 0.1 ghz radio signal is on the order of 100 hz ( 1 part in @xmath62 ) .",
    "the neutral atmosphere has the greatest effect on the frequency .",
    "the frequency shift exceeds 1 khz for all three radio frequencies before the 1 bar level is reached .",
    "refractive effects on the power are negligible for rays whose closest approach distance is in the magnetosphere .",
    "refractive effects on the power are complicated for rays whose closest approach distance is in the ionosphere .",
    "individual rays can be focused , which increases their intensity , and multipath effects can also occur .",
    "consequently , figure  [ fig : powerdbvslogr ] shows power losses calculated assuming refraction in the neutral atmosphere only . with this assumption , equations  [ eqn : expalpha ] and [ eqn : defocusingloss01 ] lead to : @xmath63",
    "since the observable quantity @xmath64 is proportional to @xmath18 , which is proportional to @xmath65 ( equation  [ eqn : expalpha ] ) , the neutral scale height @xmath23 can be inferred from measurements of @xmath66",
    ". however , these effects from the neutral atmosphere only occur at altitudes less than 700 km above 1 @xmath37 .",
    "this requires the occulted radio source to have a very close approach to jupiter .",
    "if data analogous to those shown in figures  [ fig : intfaradayvslogr][fig : powerdbvslogr ] are acquired during an occultation of a distant astrophysical radio source by a planet , then they can be analyzed using the equations set forth above to determine how planetary magnetic field strength , electron density , and neutral density vary with radial distance .",
    "the ideal distant astrophysical radio source for occultation measurements of a planetary environment is point - like .",
    "furthermore , its emissions should have a large and constant polarization , a narrow and constant frequency , and a large and constant power .",
    "nevertheless , a distant astrophysical radio source that does not satisfy all these requirements may still be useful .",
    "for instance , changes in frequency and power during an occultation will be informative even if emissions from distant astrophysical radio source are unpolarized .",
    "the angular size of the distant astrophysical radio source should be no larger than the angular size over which the environment of the occulted planet is changing .",
    "for the jupiter case study , that corresponds to an angular size of 0.01 arcseconds for the atmosphere , 0.1 arcseconds for the ionosphere , and 50 arcseconds for the magnetosphere . candidate distant astrophysical radio sources include pulsars , active galactic nuclei , and masers .",
    "pulsars are neutron stars with diameters on the order of 10 km that can be considered to be point - like sources @xcite .",
    "their radio emissions are _ often _ strongly polarized @xcite and consist of periodic short pulses @xcite .",
    "although the power in an individual pulse is highly variable , the power in an integrated pulse profile , which is the average of @xmath51100 pulses , is quite stable @xcite . since pulsar periods are on the order of milliseconds to seconds @xcite , it is feasible to generate an integrated pulse profile for which each constituent pulse can be considered to have propagated along the same path through the planetary ionosphere and magnetosphere .",
    "active galactic nuclei are supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies @xcite .",
    "accretion onto the black hole generates intense emissions at radio wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the compact central source region has an angular size on the order of milliarcseconds @xcite , so can be considered as a point - like size for occultations of jupiter s environment .",
    "emissions from the central source can be strongly linearly polarized @xcite .",
    "high resolution imaging is required to exclude emissions from lobes and jets emanating from the central source @xcite .",
    "emissions from some classes of active galactic nuclei include narrow spectral lines @xcite .",
    "masers can be either galactic or extra - galactic @xcite .",
    "galactic masers are most commonly found in association with stars @xcite . since the spatial extent of a region of maser emission is on the order of a few au @xcite , the angular size of a galactic maser",
    "can be considered point - like for occultations of jupiter s environment .",
    "their emissions are often strongly polarized @xcite .",
    "galactic maser emission occurs in narrow lines that correspond to energy level transitions in species such as sio , h@xmath67o , and oh @xcite .",
    "extra - galactic masers , known as megamasers , are associated with active galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "they are less polarized than galactic masers @xcite .",
    "their emissions , which are relatively broad @xcite , come from oh or h@xmath67o lines @xcite .",
    "another method for measuring the local electron density at a planet is available for occultations of pulsars . the arrival time for a given pulse",
    "is delayed relative to the vacuum arrival time due to the pulse s propagation through plasma in the interstellar medium and planetary environment .",
    "thus pulses that pass through regions of high electron density in a planetary magnetosphere and ionosphere will be received later than expected .",
    "the frequency - dependent time delay , @xmath68 , satisfies @xcite :    @xmath69    simulated time delays relative to vacuum for the spherically - symmetric jupiter case study are shown in figure  [ fig : timedelayvslogr ] .",
    "the time delay exceeds 1 _ microsecond _ for 0.1 ghz radio signals for distances less than 10 @xmath37 .",
    "averaging over a large number of pulses will increase the precision with which the time delay can be measured .",
    "a time series of time delays provides a series of column - integrated electron densities ( m@xmath70 ) for different distances of closest approach .",
    "these can be inverted to provide a radial profile of the local electron density ( m@xmath16 ) @xcite .",
    "the spherically symmetric model of jupiter s environment used in figure  [ fig : timedelayvslogr ] is appropriate for conditions near the terminator and on the sunward side of the planet . on the anti - sunward side of the planet ,",
    "jupiter s magnetosphere is so elongated that saturn s orbit , which is twice as far away from the sun as jupiter s , is regularly within jupiter s magnetotail @xcite . on the anti - sunward side , jupiter s",
    "magnetosphere can be represented as a cylinder of length 15 au ( @xmath71 ) @xcite and radius 200 @xmath37 @xcite . in this representation",
    ", jupiter is at the center of one circular face and the cylinder extends outwards away from the sun .",
    "the electron density in the elongated magnetotail is @xmath72 m@xmath16 @xcite , 20 times smaller than the @xmath73 m@xmath16 density in the surrounding solar wind @xcite .",
    "consequently , the simulated time delays shown in figure  [ fig : timedelayvslogr ] are inaccurate for the case in which the radio signal has traveled along the sun - jupiter line , as would occur for an occultation at opposition . for this case , we model plasma densities on the sunward side of jupiter as before , but model plasma densities on the anti - sunward side of jupiter with the elongated magnetotail described above .",
    "for closest approach distances that on the sunward side are in the outer magnetosphere , the net effect is a negative time delay , or a time advance .",
    "the long , low density magnetotail causes a time advance relative to propagation on a parallel path through the adjacent solar wind plasma , and higher densities encountered on the short sunward side are not high enough to compensate . by contrast , for closest approach distances that are close to the planet , the net effect is a time delay due to the extremely high densities encountered on the short sunward side .",
    "simulated time delays for this case are shown in figure  [ fig : timedelayoppovslogr ] .",
    "these time delays are relative to a parallel path through the solar wind plasma that surrounds jupiter s environment .",
    "the magnitude of the time delay exceeds 1 _ microsecond _ for 0.1 ghz radio signals for distances less than 2 @xmath37 or greater than 6 @xmath37 . as for the non - opposition case ,",
    "a time series of time delays for different distances of closest approach , as is illustrated in figure  [ fig : timedelayoppovslogr ] , provides information about the spatial distribution of plasma density around the planet .",
    "note also that effects exist at @xmath74@xmath75 that are not shown on this figure . at these distances of closest approach ,",
    "the time advance is the same as for tens of @xmath37  3 _ microseconds_. in this model , this 3 ms time advance ceases abruptly at 200 @xmath37 due to the sharp boundary between the low density magnetotail and the higher density solar wind at this distance from the central axis of the magnetotail . in reality",
    ", the boundary will have an appreciable spatial extent and the time advance will return to zero more gradually .",
    "we do not consider effects of the magnetotail for the non - opposition case ( figure  [ fig : timedelayvslogr ] ) because the path length through the magnetotail is much reduced away from opposition .",
    "in order to estimate the likelihood of jupiter occulting a suitable distant astrophysical radio source , we estimate the fraction of the sky obscured from view by jupiter as seen from earth over the course of one orbital period of jupiter ( 12 years ) .",
    "jupiter sweeps out a band of height @xmath76 and length @xmath77 within a full sky area of @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is jupiter s orbital semi - major axis .",
    "hence jupiter occults @xmath80 or @xmath81 of the sky over the course of one orbit .",
    "moreover , figures  [ fig : intfaradayvslogr][fig : deltafvslogr ] shows that significant effects on polarization angle and frequency occur for radio signals with a closest approach distance of 10 @xmath37 .",
    "this increases the fraction of sky covered to @xmath82 .",
    "since thousands of pulsars @xcite and tens of thousands of active galactic nuclei @xcite have been identified , it is likely that at least one occultation of a pulsar or an active galactic nucleus by the environment of jupiter will occur over the course of one jupiter year .",
    "_ however , candidate distant astrophysical radio sources are concentrated in the galactic plane , not distributed isotropically , so occultations are most likely when jupiter is near the intersection of the ecliptic and galactic planes .",
    "_    occultations of jupiter s magnetotail at opposition are also likely .",
    "since the projected area of a disk of radius 200 @xmath37 at a distance of 5 au is @xmath81 of the full sky , there is a reasonable prospect of a pulsar or other suitable distant astrophysical radio source occulting jupiter s magnetotail at a given opposition .",
    "oppositions occur approximately once per earth year",
    ". a different region of the sky will be sampled at each opposition , which increases the likelihood that a suitable distant astrophysical radio source will be appropriately positioned for at least one opposition in the near future . _",
    "the most promising oppositions are those that occur when jupiter is near the concentration of distant astrophysical radio sources within the galactic plane .",
    "_    the jupiter case study presents the problem of radio emissions from the planetary environment itself .",
    "jupiter emits radio noise at many frequencies , including decimetric radio noise at frequencies around 0.110 ghz @xcite that must be distinguished from emissions from the distant astrophysical radio source .",
    "these decimetric emissions are synchrotron radiation produced in the planet s intense radiation belts @xcite .",
    "their spectral irradiance is on the order of 10 jy @xcite , whereas a representative value for a pulsar is 10 mjy , three orders of magnitude smaller @xcite .",
    "the source region for the decimetric emissions is approximately 1 @xmath37 in radius . at 5",
    "au , that corresponds to an angular extent of 20 arcseconds .",
    "imaging with an angular resolution of 20 milliarcseconds will reduce the observed intensity of the radiation belt emissions by 6 orders of magnitude , rendering them insignificant .",
    "this issue is not a concern for other solar system planets .",
    "their decimetric emissions are much weaker than jupiter s , since they lack radiation belts as intense as jupiter s @xcite .",
    "the observations proposed in this article would be beneficial to studies of planets in our solar system .",
    "moreover , such measurements would be immensely valuable to studies of exoplanets beyond our solar system .",
    "there are as yet no measurements of the magnetic field strength , electron density , or neutral atmospheric density in the vicinity of an exoplanet .",
    "this technique could also detect ring systems around exoplanets if the rings are sufficiently dense to attenuate the radio signal appreciably @xcite .",
    "this would be a radio analogue to the discovery of the rings of uranus by their attenuation of starlight during a stellar occultation @xcite .",
    "moons _ and atmosphere - less exoplanets _ , if they fortuitously encounter the ray path , would also extinguish the radio signal . the low probability of suitable alignment of earth , an exoplanet , and a suitable distant astrophysical radio source presents a considerable challenge . a jupiter - like exoplanet in a jupiter - like orbit that is seen face - on sweeps out an area of @xmath83 km@xmath84 over the course of one orbit .",
    "if that exoplanet is at a distance of 10 light - years , then it sweeps out only @xmath85 of the total area of the sky .",
    "if the exoplanet has a jupiter - like magnetotail , then the magnetotail sweeps out @xmath86 of the total area of the sky .",
    "the concentration of both exoplanets and galactic radio sources in the galactic plane may alleviate this challenge somewhat , but it still appears formidable .",
    "observations of stellar radio emissions @xcite as an exoplanet transits in front of its parent star may offer a solution . here",
    "the stated requirement for the angular size of the distant astrophysical radio source to be no larger than the angular size over which the environment of the occulted planet is changing is clearly violated .",
    "nevertheless , imaging with suitable angular resolution can generate a small pixel size .",
    "the appropriate length - scale for jupiter s inner magnetosphere is 2.5 @xmath37 . at a distance of 10 light - years ,",
    "that length - scale subtends an angle of 0.4 milliarcseconds .",
    "very long baseline interferometry , such as the vlba , offers such angular resolution at ghz frequencies .    although not a direct result of the preceding work , one issue related to planetary ring systems should be emphasized .",
    "if a nearby exoplanet with a saturn - like ring system were to transit in front of its parent star , then very long baseline interferometry would have angular resolution comparable to the spatial extent of the ring system",
    ". observed stellar radio emissions from the obscured region of the star would be appreciably attenuated .",
    "for this to occur , the planet s ring plane must be tilted with respect to its orbital plane such that the line of sight from earth to the planet is not parallel to the ring plane .",
    "occultation of a distant astrophysical radio source by a star , rather than a planet , may also be informative .",
    "the magnetic field and plasma in the extended stellar atmosphere will affect properties of the occulted radio signal just as in a planetary ionosphere and magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "indeed , occultations of pulsars and other distant astrophysical radio sources by the sun have been used to study the magnetic field and plasma density in the solar corona @xcite . since known exoplanets number in the thousands , whereas the gaia mission will observe @xmath45 stars , the likelihood of an occultation occurring within a reasonable period of time will be significantly greater for stars than for exoplanets .",
    "moreover , high resolution imaging of radio emissions from one member of a binary star system as it is eclipsed by the other member would probe the extended stellar atmosphere of the nearer star .",
    "the polarization angle , frequency , and power of radio emissions from distant astrophysical radio sources , such as pulsars , active galactic nuclei , and masers , are affected by propagation through a planet s atmosphere , ionosphere , and magnetosphere .",
    "occultations of distant astrophysical radio sources by solar system planets , such as jupiter , can be used to measure magnetic field strength , plasma density , and neutral density in planetary environments .",
    "based on the number of known distant astrophysical radio sources , such occultations are likely to occur often .",
    "occultations of distant astrophysical radio sources by exoplanets could probe the exoplanetary environments , but such occultations are unlikely to occur frequently .",
    "an alternative type of occultation may be more promising for exoplanets : high resolution radio imaging of an exoplanet as it transits in front of its parent star .",
    "stars in eclipsing binary systems could be studied similarly .",
