    "its normalized factor is found to be a legendre polynomial .",
    "then we have investigated its nonclassicality according to the mandel s q parameter , second - order correlation function , photon - number distribution , squeezing effects and the negativity of wf in phase space .",
    "it is shown that all these nonclassical properties can be obviously improved by the hps operation and can be remarkably modulated by superposition parameters @xmath3 and @xmath6 .",
    "the degree of squeezing of the hps - sv increases with @xmath28 .",
    "in particular , comparing with the sv , an observable improvement of squeezing effect can be achieved by hermite photon - subtraction operation @xmath267 and the coherent superposition operation ( @xmath268 ) in a small region ( @xmath170 ) and a large region , respectively .",

    "it is shown that the negative area and volume diminish gradually with the evolution of time and dissapear eventually",
