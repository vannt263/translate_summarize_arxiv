    "this paper is a further extension of the method proposed in @xcite as applied to another set of jump - diffusion models : inverse normal gaussian , hyperbolic and meixner .",
    "these models have been introduced in mathematical finance within last two decades , see @xcite . however , to the best of author s knowledge it seems they received less attention of practitioners as compared , e.g. , with merton , kou and cgmy / kobol models , see @xcite for a short survey of the latter models and references therein . at the first glance this looks unfair , because typical distributions of returns produced by the former models fit the observed market data ( and , in particular , fat tails and skew ) even better than their more popular counterparts .",
    "one of the possible reasons could be that despite the pdf and the characteristic function ( cf ) of these models are known in closed form , and , therefore , pricing of plain vanilla and even american options could be done transform methods ( fft , cosine , adaptive integration in the fourier space ) , see @xcite , the analytic expressions for the pdf and cf are more complicated than that for their counterparts , and sometimes require usage of special functions .",
    "however , the latter does nt prevent pricing and hedging of simple vanilla instruments to be efficiently done .",
    "the second point is that the considered models are pure jump models that do nt contain a diffusion component .",
    "this , however , could be easy relaxed .    on the other hand , nowadays practitioners want to have a model which is capable to simultaneously fit market data on both vanilla and exotic options . for doing that they need to consider kind of a stochastic local volatility ( lsv ) model , or even a lsv model with jumps .",
    "under these conditions neither the pdf , nor the cf are available in closed form . therefore , efficient numerical methods should be used to solve the pricing equations which belong to the class of partial integro - differential equations ( pide ) .",
    "a number of methods were proposed to address such a construction , see @xcite and references therein as well as discussion of problems related to their implementation . in particular , they include a discretization of the pide that is implicit in the differential terms and explicit in the integral term ( @xcite ) , picard iterations for computing the integral equation ( @xcite ) and a second - order accurate , unconditionally - stable operator splitting ( adi ) method that does not require an iterative solution of an algebraic equation at each time step ( @xcite ) .",
    "various forms of operator splitting technique were also used for this purpose ( @xcite ) . in this paper , we will review operator splitting on financial processes in more detail .    assuming that an efficient discretization of the pide in time was properly chosen , the remaining problem is a fast computation of the jump integral , as it was observed to be relatively expensive .",
    "a short survey of various proposed method including review of their advantages and disadvantages again could be found in @xcite .",
    "also in that paper the original method proposed in @xcite was further elaborated on exploiting the following idea .",
    "first , we use an operator - splitting method on the financial processes , thus separating the computation of the diffusion part from the integral part . then , similar to @xcite",
    ", we represent the jump integral in the form of a pseudo - differential operator .",
    "next we formally solve the obtained evolutionary partial pseudo - differential equations via a matrix exponential .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the matrix exponential can be efficiently computed for merton s , kou s and cgmy models , and that the efficiency of this method is not worse than that of the fft .",
    "it was also mentioned that the proposed method is almost universal , i.e. , it allows computation of pides for various jump - diffusion models in a unified form .",
    "it is also important that this method is relatively simple for implementation .    in the present paper",
    "we apply this approach to the inverse normal gaussian , hyperbolic and meixner models .",
    "we construct finite difference schemes to solve the corresponding pides and prove that all the proposed schemes demonstrate the second order convergence in space and time and are unconditionally stable .",
    "the suggested approach is new and eliminates some known limitations of the existing methods , see discussion in @xcite .",
    "also , for the first time splitting and matrix exponential method is used as applied to the referenced jump models .",
    "this allows an efficient usage of these models in a more complex framework , e.g. , the lsv model with jumps .",
    "furthermore , the complexity of solving a pure jump evolutionary equation for the meixner model using the new method is close to @xmath0 which is better than that of the fft .    finally , as the distributions underlying the corresponding lvy processes are capable to fit well the market data , using these jump models together with the efficient numerical method for solving the jump - diffusion pides potentially gives rise to a more efficient pricing and hedging of the derivative instruments .",
    "also to underline , despite the general idea of the method has been already described in @xcite constructing a particular discretization of the jump operators could be different for every model .",
    "this requires the corresponding propositions to be proved in every case to demonstrate approximation , stability and complexity of the method .",
    "therefore , these schemes , propositions and proofs are the main contributions of this paper .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we briefly discuss a general form of a backward pide for the class of lvy models . in section  [ sec4 ]",
    "we present our general approach to the solution of the pide using splitting and the matrix exponential approach .",
    "an explicit construction of various finite - difference schemes of the first and second order is presented in the next section .",
    "the results presented in that section are new , and to the best of our knowledge have not been discussed in the literature .",
    "our technique utilizes some results from matrix analysis related to definitions of m - matrices , metzler matrices and eventually exponentially nonnegative matrices .",
    "we also provide the results of various numerical tests to demonstrate convergence of our method . the final section concludes .",
    "to avoid uncertainty , let us consider the problem of pricing equity options written on a single stock .",
    "as we will see , this specification does not cause us to lose any generality , but it makes the description more practical .",
    "we assume an underlying asset ( stock ) price @xmath1 be driven by an exponential of a lvy process @xmath2 where @xmath3 is time , @xmath4 is option expiration , @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the lvy process @xmath7 with a nonzero brownian ( diffusion ) part . under the pricing measure , @xmath6 is given by @xmath8 with triplet @xmath9 ) , where @xmath10 is a standard brownian motion on @xmath11 and @xmath12 is a pure jump process .",
    "we consider this process under the pricing measure , and therefore @xmath13 is a martingale , where @xmath14 is the interest rate and @xmath15 is a continuous dividend .",
    "this allows us to express @xmath16 as ( @xcite ) @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a measure which satisfies @xmath19    we leave @xmath18 unspecified at this time , because we are open to consider all types of jumps including those with finite and infinite variation , and finite and infinite activity .    to price options written on the underlying process",
    "@xmath1 , we want to derive a pide that describes time evolution of the european option prices @xmath20 . using a standard martingale approach , or by creating a self - financing portfolio",
    ", one can derive the corresponding pide ( @xcite ) @xmath21 \\nu(dy)\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] for all @xmath22 , subject to the terminal condition @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the option payoff , and some boundary conditions which depend on the type of the option .",
    "the solutions of this pide usually belong to the class of viscosity solutions ( @xcite ) .",
    "we now rewrite the integral term using the following idea .",
    "it is well known from quantum mechanics ( @xcite ) that a translation ( shift ) operator in @xmath25 space could be represented as @xmath26 with @xmath27 = const , so @xmath28    therefore , the integral in can be formally rewritten as @xmath29 \\nu(dy ) =   \\mathcal{j } c(x , t ) , \\\\ \\mathcal{j } & \\equiv \\int_\\mathbb{r}\\left [ \\exp \\left ( y \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x } \\right ) - 1 - ( e^y-1 ) \\fp{}{x } \\right ] \\nu(dy ) .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the definition of operator @xmath30 ( which is actually an infinitesimal generator of the jump process ) , the integral can be formally computed under some mild assumptions about existence and convergence if one treats the term @xmath31 as a constant .",
    "therefore , operator @xmath30 can be considered as some generalized function of the differential operator @xmath32 .",
    "we can also treat @xmath30 as a pseudo - differential operator .    for the future ,",
    "an important observation is that @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the characteristic exponent of the jump process .",
    "this directly follows from the lvy - khinchine theorem .",
    "note , that thus defined characteristic exponent is computed using the expectation under a risk - neutral measure . in other words ,",
    "the last term in the definition of @xmath30 is a compensator which is added to make the forward price to be a true martingale under this measure .    with allowance for this representation ,",
    "the whole pide in the can be rewritten in operator form as @xmath35c(x,\\tau),\\ ] ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37 represents a differential ( parabolic ) operator @xmath38 where the operator @xmath37 is an infinitesimal generator of diffusion .",
    "notice that for jumps with finite variation and finite activity , the last two terms in the definition of the jump integral @xmath30 in could be integrated out and added to the definition of @xmath37 . in the case of jumps with finite variation and infinite activity , the last term could be integrated out .",
    "however , here we will leave these terms under the integral for two reasons : i ) this transformation ( moving some terms under the integral to the diffusion operator ) does not affect our method of computation of the integral , and ii ) adding these terms to the operator @xmath37 could potentially negatively influence the stability of the finite - difference scheme used to solve the parabolic equation @xmath39 .",
    "this equation naturally appears as a part of our splitting method , which is discussed in the next section .",
    "to solve we use splitting .",
    "this technique is also known as the method of fractional steps ( see @xcite ) and sometimes is cited in financial literature as russian splitting or locally one - dimensional schemes ( lod ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "below we follow @xcite to give a short survey of this technique as applied to linear and nonlinear pdes .    the method of fractional steps reduces the solution of the original @xmath40-dimensional unsteady problem to the solution of @xmath40 one - dimensional equations per time step .",
    "for example , consider a two - dimensional diffusion equation with a solution obtained by using some finite - difference method . at every time step ,",
    "a standard discretization on space variables is applied , such that the finite - difference grid contains @xmath41 nodes in the first dimension and @xmath42 nodes in the second dimension .",
    "then the problem is solving a system of @xmath43 linear equations , and the matrix of this system is block - diagonal . in contrast ,",
    "utilization of splitting results in , e.g. , @xmath41 systems of @xmath42 linear equations , where the matrix of each system is banded ( tridiagonal ) .",
    "the latter approach is easy to implement and , more importantly , provides significantly better performance .",
    "the previous procedure uses operator splitting in different dimensions .",
    "@xcite and then @xcite extended this idea for complex physical processes ( for instance , diffusion in the chemically reacting gas , or the advection - diffusion problem ) .",
    "in addition to ( or instead of ) splitting on spatial coordinates , they also proposed splitting the equation into physical processes that differ in nature , for instance , convection and diffusion .",
    "this idea becomes especially efficient if the characteristic times of evolution ( relaxation time ) of such processes are significantly different .",
    "for the pide in we use a version of splitting described in @xcite which gives rise to the following numerical scheme : @xmath44    thus , instead of an unsteady pide , we obtain one pide with no drift and diffusion ( the second equation in ) and two unsteady pdes ( the first and third ones in ) .    in what follows ,",
    "we consider how to efficiently solve the second equation , while assuming that the solution of the first and the third equations can be obtained using any finite - difference method that is sufficiently efficient . to this end , in various examples given in the next sections we will explicitly mention what particular method was used for this purpose .    to solve the second ( pure jump ) evolutionary equation",
    "we again follow the method of @xcite . by definition of the jump generator @xmath30 , under some mild constraints on its existence",
    ", @xmath30 could be viewed as a function of the operator @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , solving the integral ( second ) equation in requires a few steps .",
    "first , we construct an appropriate discrete grid @xmath45 in the truncated ( originally infinite ) space domain .",
    "this grid could be nonuniform .",
    "an important point is that in the space domain where the parabolic equations of are defined , this grid should coincide with the finite - difference grid constructed for the solution of these parabolic equations . in other words ,",
    "the pide grid is a superset of the pde grid .",
    "this is useful to avoid interpolation of the solution that is obtained on the jump grid ( the second step of the splitting algorithm ) to the diffusion grid that is constructed to obtain solutions at the first and third splitting steps .    for the sake of concreteness let the parabolic equation be solved at the space domain @xmath46,$ ] @xmath47 , @xmath48 using a nonuniform grid with @xmath49 nodes ( @xmath50 ) and space steps @xmath51 .",
    "the particular choice of @xmath52 and @xmath53 is determined by the problem under consideration .",
    "we certainly want @xmath54 and @xmath55 not to be too large .",
    "the integration limits of @xmath30 in are , however , plus and minus infinity .",
    "truncation of these limits usually is done to fit memory and performance requirements . on the other hand , we want a fine grid close to the option strike @xmath56 for better accuracy .",
    "therefore , a reasonable way to construct a jump grid is as follows . for @xmath57 ,",
    "the jump grid coincides with the grid used for solution of the parabolic pdes . outside of this domain ,",
    "the grid is expanded by adding nonuniform steps ; i.e. , the entire jump grid is @xmath58 . here",
    "@xmath59 are some integer numbers that are chosen based on our preferences .",
    "since contribution to @xmath30 from very large values of @xmath60 is negligible , the outer grid points @xmath61 and @xmath62 can be made highly nonuniform .",
    "one possible algorithm could be to have the steps of these grids be a geometric progression .",
    "this allows one to cover the truncated infinite interval with a reasonably small number of nodes .",
    "second , the discretization of @xmath32 should be chosen on @xmath45 .",
    "we want this discretization to :    1 .",
    "provide the necessary order of approximation of the whole operator @xmath30 in space .",
    "2 .   provide unconditional stability of the solution of the second equation in .",
    "3 .   provide positivity of the solution .",
    "let @xmath63 denote a discrete analog of @xmath32 obtained by discretization of @xmath32 on the grid @xmath45 .",
    "accordingly , let us define the matrix @xmath64 to be the discrete analog of the operator @xmath30 on the grid @xmath45 . in @xcite",
    "the following proposition is proven that translates the above requirements to the conditions on @xmath64 .",
    "[ prop0 ] the finite - difference scheme @xmath65 is unconditionally stable in time @xmath66 and preserves positivity of the vector @xmath67 if there exists an m - matrix @xmath68 such that @xmath69 .",
    "this proposition gives us a recipe for the construction of the appropriate discretization of the operator @xmath30 . in the next section",
    ", we will give some explicit examples of this approach .",
    "once the discretization is performed , all we need is to compute a matrix exponential @xmath70 , and then a product of this exponential with @xmath67 .",
    "the following facts make this method competitive with those briefly described in the introduction .",
    "we need to take into account that :    1 .",
    "the matrix @xmath64 can be precomputed once the finite - difference grid @xmath45 has been built .",
    "if a constant time step is used for computations , the matrix @xmath71 can also be precomputed .",
    "if the above two statements are true , the second splitting step results in computing a product of a matrix with time - independent entries and a vector .",
    "the complexity of this operation is @xmath72 , assuming the matrix @xmath73 is @xmath74 , and the vector is @xmath75 .",
    "however , @xmath76 in this case is relatively small ( see some numerical examples and estimates in @xcite ) .",
    "also the product @xmath77 can be computed using fft , if at every time step one re - interpolates values from @xmath45 to the fft grid , similar to how this was done in @xcite .",
    "this reduces the total complexity to @xmath78 .    in some special cases",
    "( merton s jump model , kou model ) the product @xmath77 could be computed with the complexity @xmath0 using some tricks proposed in @xcite .",
    "we will further exploit this idea for some models described in this paper .",
    "the above consideration is sufficiently general in the sense that it covers any particular jump model where jumps are modeled as an exponential process .",
    "below we review three jump models : inverse normal gaussian , hyperbolic and meixner . given a model ,",
    "our goal is to construct a finite - difference scheme , first for @xmath63 , and then for @xmath64 , that satisfies the conditions of proposition  [ prop0 ] .",
    "again we want to emphasize that we discuss these jump models being a part of a more general either lv or lsv model with jumps .",
    "otherwise , as the cf of the considered models are known in closed form , any fft based method would be more efficient in , e.g. , obtaining prices of european vanilla options .",
    "the nig type lvy process was introduced by @xcite as a model for log returns of stock prices .",
    "it is a sub - class of the more general class of hyperbolic lvy processes that we will consider in the next section . @xcite",
    "considered classes of normal variance - mean mixtures and defined the nig distribution as the case when the mixing distribution is inverse gaussian with the characteristic exponent    @xmath79    therefore , the cf function reads @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "it is known that parameters of the nig play the following role for the underlying distribution : @xmath82 is responsible for the tail heaviness of steepness , @xmath83 affects the symmetry , @xmath84 scales the distribution , and @xmath85 determines the mean value ( location ) .",
    "it is also known that when using the nig process for option pricing the location parameter of the distribution has no effect on the option value , so one can use @xmath86 .",
    "this , however , is not critical for the below approach and could be easily relaxed .",
    "the linearity of the log of the characteristic function with respect to time shows that it is an infinitely divisible process with stationary independent increments .",
    "the nig process has no diffusion component making it a pure jump process with the lvy density @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the modified bessel function of the third kind    next we need to substitute into the definition of the operator @xmath30 in and fulfill a formal integration to obtain the corresponding evolutionary pure jump equation in the explicit form .",
    "however , as it was mentioned earlier this step could be formalized by making use of",
    ". therefore , we immediately obtain @xmath89 where @xmath90 . the corresponding evolutionary pure jump equation to be solved",
    "is @xmath91 before constructing a finite difference scheme to solve this equation we need to introduce some definitions . define a one - sided _ forward _ discretization of @xmath92 , which we denote as @xmath93/h$ ] . also define a one - sided _ backward _ discretization of @xmath92 , denoted as @xmath94/h$ ] .",
    "these discretizations provide first order approximation in @xmath95 , e.g. , @xmath96 . to provide the second order approximations , use the following definitions .",
    "define @xmath97 - the _ central _ difference approximation of the second derivative @xmath98 , and @xmath99 - the _ central _ difference approximation of the first derivative @xmath92 .",
    "also define a one - sided second order approximations to the first derivatives : _ backward _ approximation @xmath100/(2 h)$ ] , and _ forward _ approximation @xmath101/(2 h)$ ] .",
    "also @xmath102 denotes a unit matrix .",
    "all these definitions assume that we work on a uniform grid , however this could be easily generalized for the non - uniform grid as well , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "below we consider two cases , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",

    "see appendix .",

    "see appendix .",
    "thus , according to proposition  [ prop0 ] these finite difference schemes are unconditionally stable starting with some @xmath76 , preserve positivity of the solution , and approximate operator @xmath30 with @xmath107 . in our experiments shown below this positivity",
    "was achieved at @xmath109 .    to complete the solution we need to compute the matrix exponential @xmath110 and the product @xmath111 .",
    "the last step , however , could be further simplified . to see this recall that the diffusion equations in have to be solved up to some order of approximation in time @xmath66 .",
    "suppose for this purpose we want to use a finite - difference scheme that provides a second order approximation , @xmath112 .",
    "however , gives an _ exact _ solution of the corresponding pure jump equation ( the second step in strang s splitting scheme ) .",
    "since strang s scheme guarantees only second - order accuracy ( @xmath113 ) to the exact solution of the full pide , the second step could be computed to the same order of accuracy .    to this end",

    "[ [ numerical - experiments ] ] numerical experiments + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in our numerical experiments we consider the nig model which also has a diffusion component uncorrelated with the jumps .",
    "we compute just one step of the splitting procedure , i.e. the jump integral , and do nt consider solution of the diffusion part of the model .",
    "we want to price a european call option and take the option model parameters similar to @xcite , i.e. , @xmath119 .",

    "we compare our solution for the jump step with that obtained with @xmath127 which is assumed to be close to the exact value .",
