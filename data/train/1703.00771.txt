    "it has been extensively studied the existence of fixed points of functions which satisfy certain conditions since the time of stefan banach .",
    "at first we recall the banach contraction principle as follows :    @xcite [ thm3 ] let @xmath0 be a complete metric space and a self - mapping @xmath1 be a contraction , that is , there exists some @xmath2 such that@xmath3for any @xmath4 . then there exists a unique fixed point @xmath5 of @xmath6 .",
    "since then many authors have been studied new contractive conditions for fixed - point theorems .",
    "for example , caristi gave the following fixed - point theorem .",
    "@xcite [ thm10 ] let @xmath0 be a complete metric space and @xmath1 .",
    "if there exists a lower semicontinuous function @xmath7 mapping @xmath8 into the nonnegative real numbers@xmath9@xmath10 then @xmath11 has a fixed point .    in @xcite , rhoades defined the following condition ( which is called rhoades condition):@xmath12for all @xmath4 with @xmath13 .    in some special metric spaces , mappings with fixed points have been used in neural networks as activation functions . for example ,",
    "mbius transformations have been used for this purpose .",
    "it is known that a mbius transformation is a rational function of the form@xmath14where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 are complex numbers satisfying @xmath19 .",
    "a mbius transformation has at most two fixed points ( see jones - singerman for more details about mbius transformations ) . in @xcite",
    ", mandic identified the activation function of a neuron and a single - pole all - pass digital filter section as mbius transformations .",
    "he observed that the fixed points of a neural network were determined by the fixed points of the employed activation function .",
    "so the existence of the fixed points of an activation function were guaranteed by the underlying mbius transformation ( one or two fixed points ) .    on the other hand",
    ", there are some examples of functions which fix a circle . for example , let @xmath20 be the metric space with the usual metric@xmath21for all @xmath22 .",
    "let the mapping @xmath11 be defined as@xmath23for all @xmath24 .",
    "the mapping @xmath11 fixes the unit circle @xmath25 . in @xcite , zdemir , iskender and zgr",
    "used new types of activation functions which fix a circle for a complex valued neural network ( cvnn ) .",
    "the usage of these types activation functions lead us to guarantee the existence of fixed points of the complex valued hopfield neural network ( cvhnn ) .",
    "therefore it is important the notions of fixed circle  and mappings with a fixed circle .",
    "it will be an interesting problem to study some fixed - circle theorems on general spaces ( metric spaces or normed spaces ) .",
    "motivated by the above studies , our aim in this paper is to examine some fixed - circle theorems for self - mappings on metric spaces .",
    "also we determine the uniqueness conditions of these theorems . in section [ sec:1 ]",
    "we introduce the notion of a fixed circle and prove three theorems for the existence of fixed circles of self - mappings on metric spaces .",
    "also we give some necessary examples for obtained fixed - circle theorems . in section",
    "sec:2 we present some self - mappings which have at least two fixed circles .",
    "hence we give three uniqueness theorems for the fixed - circle theorems obtained in section [ sec:1 ] .",
    "in this section we give fixed - circle theorems under some conditions on metric spaces and obtain some examples of mappings which have or not fixed circles . at first",
