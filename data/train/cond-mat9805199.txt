    "in the clean homogeneous electron gas the wave functions of electrons are plane waves and the density of electron gas is constant in space . in disordered conductors",
    "electrons are scattered by impurities , which change their wave functions from the plane waves .",
    "this , in turn , results in spatial variations of the electron density .",
    "it is appropriate to describe those variations by introducing the local density of electron states , @xmath1 , which is determined by the equation @xmath2 where index @xmath3 specifies the electronic states , and the factor of two reflects the spin degeneracy .",
    "the distribution function of the local dos at the fixed energy in open metallic disordered samples was studied in many papers ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) with the emphasis on the rare , nontypical fluctuations .",
    "it was found that although the local dos distribution is close to the gaussian one , it has slowly decaying logarithmically normal asymptotics .",
    "prigodin@xcite studied correlation function of the density of the electron states of a two - dimensional system at different energies in relation to the nmr line shape .",
    "it is well - known that strong magnetic field modifies the single - particle density of electron states , both local and average , due to the landau quantization . in a two - dimensional electron gas",
    "the quantization leads to a peak structure in the average density of states , which is revealed in tunneling experiments as peaks in the dependence of the tunneling conductance on the applied bias , see , _ e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite . the form and width of these peaks",
    "are determined@xcite by the disorder .    in a weak magnetic field",
    "the distance between the landau levels , @xmath0 , is smaller than their disorder - induced width . as a result ,",
    "in such `` classical '' magnetic field , oscillations in the average density of states caused by the landau quantization become exponentially small @xcite , @xmath4 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath5 is a quantum lifetime of an electron .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to show that , despite such `` classical '' magnetic field does not influence the average dos , it does produce a significant effect on the correlation function of the _ local _ density of states fluctuations @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the local deviation of the dos in point @xmath8 from its average value , @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the electron mass , and brackets @xmath11 denote averaging over the random impurity potential .",
    "clearly , the correlation function depends only on difference of energy agruments , @xmath12 .",
    "the effect of the classical magnetic field on the dos correlation function becomes pronounced if the disorder potential has a correlation length much larger than the fermi wave length . in such a potential ,",
    "electrons experience small - angle scattering , and their transport relaxation time @xmath13 , is much larger than @xmath5 .",
    "thus there exists a range of magnetic fields , in which landau quantization is suppressed ( @xmath14 ) , while classical electron trajectories are strongly affected by the field ( @xmath15 ) . in this regime the correlation function , @xmath16 is strongly enhanced with respect to the zero magnetic field case and exhibits peaks as a function of energy difference @xmath17 with the distance between peaks equal to the cyclotron quantum , @xmath0 . for the macroscopically homogeneous sample the shape of the @xmath18-th peak , @xmath19 , in the local dos correlation function is given by : @xmath20 where @xmath21^{1/2},\\ ] ] and @xmath22 is the fermi energy .",
    "as @xmath18 gets bigger , the width of the peaks increases and their height decreases , so that eventually the oscillatory structure is washed out .",
    "the total number of resolved peaks is of the order of @xmath23 .",
    "sensitivity of the correlation function @xmath24 to the classical magnetic field comes from the fact , that this function is directly associated with the self - crossing of classical electron trajectories .",
    "we denote the probability for an electron to complete a loop of self - crossing trajectory over time @xmath25 as @xmath26 .",
    "the correlation function , @xmath27 , turns out to be proportional to the fourier transform of this return probability , @xmath28 the strong enough , @xmath29 , magnetic field curves the electron trajectories , significantly affects the return probability and , in turn , leads to specific correlations in the local dos at @xmath30 .    for long time scales @xmath31 , the function @xmath26 can be found from the diffusion equation .",
    "it gives @xmath32 for the two - dimensional case ( @xmath33 is the diffusion coefficient ) .",
    "the fourier transform , @xmath34 , is proportional to @xmath35 , which leads to the well - known@xcite logarithmic form of the local dos correlation function with the renormalized by the magnetic field diffusion coefficient .    at short time",
    "scales , @xmath36 , electrons move ballistically along the cyclotron orbits .",
    "provided that @xmath37 , during the time @xmath25 electron may return to the initial point many times .",
    "multiple periodic returns of electron produce peaks in the probability fourier transform @xmath34 at energies , which are multiples of the cyclotron quantum .",
    "correlation function @xmath16 oscillates with the same period , which is reflected by eq .",
    "( [ result ] ) .",
    "now we derive expression for the correlation function of the local dos , @xmath24 , valid for arbitrary electron energies .",
    "we omit the planck constant in all the intermediate formulas . the dos , eq .",

    "@xcite ) . in general",
    ", the product of two exact green s functions @xmath52 oscillates rapidly with the distance between its arguments , so that the function @xmath53 averages out .",

    "namely , the sizes @xmath54 or , alternatively , @xmath55 of spatial domains defining the ends of a trajectory should be small enough ( less than @xmath56 ) so that electron propagation in these two domains could be described by plane waves .",
    "if the ends of trajectories are separated by the distance exceeding electron wave - length , @xmath57 , one can relate the function @xmath58 to the generalized classical correlation functions ",

    "provided that we are interested in the dos correlation function in the presence of the magnetic field , the problem can be further simplified . indeed ,",

    "disorder , however , makes the return probability nonzero .",
    "in fact , disorder leads to two effects : ( 1 ) motion along the cyclotron orbit is accompanied by the angular diffusion , and ( 2 ) in addition to the boundary - induced drift , the guiding center of the electron cyclotron orbit diffuses in the direction perpendicular to the boundary .",
    "as we will see , for small enough initial angles @xmath83 these two effects can , in fact , overcome the boundary - induced drift of electron away from the contact .    from eqs .",
    "( [ vd ] ) and ( [ inc ] ) we see that the larger initial angle @xmath83 is , the faster electron drifts away from the contact . in the view of this fact ,",
