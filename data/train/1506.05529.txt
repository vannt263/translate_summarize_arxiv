    "nowadays , online social networks which can provide users with various services have become ubiquitous in our daily life .",
    "the services provided by social networks are very diverse , e.g. , make new friends online , read and write comments on recent news , recommend products and locations , etc .",
    "real - world social networks which can provide these services usually have heterogeneous information , involving various kinds of information entities ( e.g. , users , locations , posts ) and complex connections ( e.g. , social links among users , purchase links between users and products ) . meanwhile , among these services provided by social networks , community detection techniques play a very important role . for example , organizing online friends into different categories ( e.g. , `` family members '' , `` celebrities '' , and `` classmates '' ) in facebook and group - level recommendations of products in e - commerce sites are all based on community structures of users detected from the networks .",
    "meanwhile , as proposed in @xcite , to enjoy more social services , users nowadays are usually involved in multiple online social networks simultaneously , e.g. , facebook , twitter and foursquare .",
    "furthermore , some of these networks can share common information either due to the common network establishing purpose or because of similar network features @xcite . across these networks ,",
    "the common users are defined as the _ anchor users _ , while the remaining non - shared users are named as the _ non - anchor users_. connections between _",
    "anchor users _ accounts in different networks are defined as the _ anchor links_. the networks partially aligned by _",
    "anchor links _ are called _ multiple partially aligned networks_.    in this paper , we want to detect the communities of each network across multiple _ partially aligned social networks _ simultaneously , which is formally defined as the _ mutual clustering _ problem .",
    "the goal is to distill relevant information from another social network to compliment knowledge directly derivable from each network to improve the clustering or community detection , while preserving the distinct characteristics of each individual network .",
    "the _ mutual clustering _",
    "problem is very important for online social networks and can be the prerequisite for many concrete social network applications : ( 1 ) _ network partition _ : detected communities can usually represent small - sized subgraphs of the network , and ( 2 ) _ comprehensive understanding of user social behaviors _ : community structures of the shared users in multiple aligned networks can provide a complementary understanding of their social interactions in online social networks .    besides its importance , the _ mutual clustering _ problem is a novel problem and different from existing clustering problems , including : ( 1 ) _ consensus clustering _ , @xcite which aims at achieving a consensus result of several input clustering results about the same data ; ( 2 ) _ multi - view clustering _ , @xcite whose target is to partition objects into clusters based on their different representations , e.g. , clustering webpages with text information and hyperlinks ; ( 3 ) _ multi - relational clustering _ , @xcite which focuses on clustering objects in one relation ( called target relation ) using information in multiple inter - linked relations ; and ( 4 ) _ co - regularized multi - domain graph clustering _",
    "@xcite , which relaxes the _",

    "problem aims at detecting the communities for multiple networks involving both anchor and non - anchor users simultaneously and each network contains heterogeneous information about users social activities . a more detailed comparison of _ mutual clustering _ problem with these related problems is available in table  [ tab : related ] .    despite its importance and novelty , the _ mutual clustering _",
    "is very challenging to solve due to :    * _ closeness measure _ : users in heterogeneous social networks can be connected with each other by various direct and indirect connections .",
    "a general closeness measure among users with such connection information is the prerequisite for addressing the _ mutual clustering",
    "_ problem . * _ network characteristics _ : social networks usually have their own characteristics , which can be reflected in the community structures formed by users .",
    "preservation of each network s characteristics ( i.e. , some unique structures in each network s detected communities ) is very important in the _ mutual clustering _ problem . *",
    "_ mutual community detection _",
    ": information in different networks can provide us with a more comprehensive understanding about the anchor users social structures . for anchor users",
    "whose community structures are not clear based on in formation in one network , utilizing the heterogeneous information in aligned networks to refine and disambiguate the community structures about the anchor users .",
    "however , how to achieve such a goal is still an open problem . *",
    "_ lack of metrics_. _ mutual clustering _",
    "problem is a new problem and few existing metrics can be applied to evaluate the comprehensive performance of _ mutual clustering _",
    "methods .    to solve all these challenges , a novel cross - network community detection method , mcd ( mutual community detector ) , is proposed in this paper .",

    "quality _ and _ consensus _ metrics , we define a novel general metric , @xmath0 ( integrated quality & consensus ) , to evaluate the performance of mutual clustering methods .    this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : formulation ] , we formulate the problem . section  [ sec : method ] introduces the _ mutual clustering _ methods .",
    "section  [ sec : experiment ] shows the experiment results . in sections  [ sec : relatedwork ] and [ sec :",
    "conclusion ] , we give the related works and conclude this paper .",
    "the networks studied in this paper are foursquare and twitter .",
    "users in both foursquare and twitter can follow other users , write tips / tweets , which can contain timestamps , text content and location check - ins . as a result , both foursquare and twitter can be modeled as heterogeneous information networks @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the set of different types of nodes in the network and @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 are the node sets of users , posts , location check - ins , timestamps and words respectively , while @xmath8 is set of directed links in the network and @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the sets of social links among users , links between users and posts and those between posts and location - checkins , timestamps as well as words respectively .",
    "to illustrate the structure of the heterogeneous network studied in this paper , we also give an example in figure  [ eg_fig3 ] .",
    "as shown in the figure , users in the network can be extensively connected with each other by different types of links ( e.g. , social links , co - location checkins connections ) .",
    "the multiple aligned networks can be modeled as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the set of @xmath16 heterogeneous information networks and @xmath17 is the set of undirected anchor links between different heterogeneous networks in @xmath18 . in this paper",
    ", we will follow the definitions about `` anchor user '' , `` non - anchor user '' , `` anchor link '' , etc . proposed in @xcite and the constraint on anchor links",
    "is `` _ _ one - to - one _ _ '' , i.e. , each user can have one account in on network . the case that users have multiple accounts in online social networks",
    "can be resolved with method introduced in @xcite , where these duplicated accounts can be aggregated in advance to form one unique vitural account in advance and the anchor links connecting these vitural accounts will be still `` _ _ one - to - one _ _ '' .",

    "users in each detected cluster are more densely connected with each other than with users in other clusters . in this paper , we focus on studying the hard ( i.e. , non - overlapping ) clustering of users in online social networks .",

    ", we introduce the network characteristics preservation independent clustering method in section 3.2 and normalized discrepancy based co - clustering method in section 3.3 . to preserve network characteristics and use information in other networks to refine community structures mutually at the same time",
    ", we study the mutual clustering problem in section 3.4 .      many existing similarity measures , e.g. , `` common neighbor '' @xcite , `` jaccard s coefficient '' @xcite , defined for homogeneous networks can not capture all the connections among users in heterogeneous networks . to use both direct and indirect connections among users in calculating the similarity score among users in the heterogeneous information network ,",
    "we introduce meta path based similarity measure hnmp - sim in this section .      in heterogeneous networks ,",
    "pairs of nodes can be connected by different paths , which are sequences of links in the network .",
    "meta paths @xcite in heterogeneous networks , i.e. , _ heterogeneous network meta paths _ ( hnmps ) , can capture both direct and indirect connections among nodes in a network .",
    "the length of a meta path is defined as the number of links that constitute it .",
    "meta paths in networks can start and end with various node types .",
    "however , in this paper , we are mainly concerned about those starting and ending with users , which are formally defined as the _ social hnmps_. the notation , definition and semantics of @xmath29 different _ social hnmps _ used in this paper are listed in table  [ tab : meta_path ] . to extract the social meta paths , prior domain knowledge about the network structure is required .",
    "these @xmath29 different social hnmps in table  [ tab : meta_path ] can cover lots of connections among users in networks .",
    "some meta path based similarity measures have been proposed so far , e.g. , the _ pathsim _ proposed in @xcite , which is defined for undirected networks and considers different meta paths to be of the same importance . to measure the social closeness among users in directed heterogeneous information networks , we extend _ pathsim _ to propose a new closeness measure as follows .    * definition 1 * ( hnmp - sim ) : let @xmath30 and @xmath31 be the sets of path instances of hnmp # @xmath32 going from @xmath33 to @xmath34 and those going from @xmath33 to other nodes in the network .",
    "the hnmp - sim ( hnmp based similarity ) of node pair @xmath35 is defined as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the weight of hnmp # @xmath32 and @xmath38 . in this paper ,",
    "the weights of different hnmps can be automatically adjusted by applying the technique proposed in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath39 be the _ adjacency matrix _ corresponding to the hnmp # i among users in the network and @xmath40 iff there exist @xmath41 different path instances of hnmp # @xmath32 from user @xmath42 to @xmath16 in the network .",
    "furthermore , the similarity score matrix among users of hnmp # @xmath32 can be represented as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 denotes the transpose of @xmath45 , diagonal matrices @xmath46 and @xmath47 have values @xmath48 and @xmath49 on their diagonals respectively . the hnmp - sim matrix of the network which can capture all possible connections among users is represented as follows : @xmath50      clustering each network independently can preserve each networks characteristics effectively as no information from external networks will interfere with the clustering results .",
    "partitioning users of a certain network into several clusters will cut connections in the network and lead to some costs inevitably .",
    "optimal clustering results can be achieved by minimizing the clustering costs .    for a given network @xmath51 ,",
    "let @xmath52 be the community structures detected from @xmath51 .",
    "term @xmath53 is defined to be the complement of set @xmath54 in @xmath51 .",
    "various cost measure of partition @xmath55 can be used , e.g. , _ cut _ @xcite and _ normalized cut _ @xcite : @xmath56 @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the hnmp - sim between @xmath59 and @xmath60 .    for all users in @xmath3 , their clustering result can be represented in the _ result confidence matrix _ @xmath61 , where @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65^t$ ] , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 denotes the confidence that @xmath69 is in cluster @xmath70 .",
