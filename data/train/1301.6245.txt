    "many problems in geophysical fluid dynamics feature quasi - two - dimensional flows due to the presence of rotation , stratification , or shallow water ; and a ubiquitous feature of such flows is the presence of large - scale vorticity structures .",
    "two examples can be found in the atlantic ocean : an instability of the gulf stream leads to the formation of gulf stream rings of relatively hot or cold water @xcite ; and the flow of water out of the mediterranean sea leads to the formation of meddies , which are rotating regions of relatively warm and salty water @xcite . in both cases",
    ", the vorticity structures can have life times of more than a year , and are important in the transport of heat and salt across the atlantic . during their life times",
    ", these structures can interact with both coastal and submarine topography , which leads to deformation of the structures .",
    "for example , richard  &  tychensky @xcite observed the interaction of meddies with underwater seamounts , and found that such interactions could cause the meddy to break up .",
    "the simplest formulation within which to study such flows is the two - dimensional incompressible euler equations .",
    "this formulation has been used by johnson  &  mcdonald @xcite who modelled vortex patches as point vortices in order to investigate the paths of ocean vortex patches in the vicinity of boundaries such as islands or coastal gaps . however , with the exception of a few contour dynamics calculations ( e.g.  appendix c of thompson @xcite and crowdy  &  surana @xcite ) , there has been little focus on the deformation of vorticity structures caused by the presence of boundaries .",
    "this motivates the more systematic investigation presented here .    as a model for more complex vorticity structures ,",
    "we consider ( initially circular ) patches of uniform vorticity and utilise the elliptic model of melander , zabusky & styczek @xcite .",
    "this model has been widely used , with successful applications including the study of symmetric vortex merging both with@xcite and without@xcite an imposed background shear flow .",
    "we favour the simplicity of this low - order model over the potential for increased realism from models with varying vorticity such as the elliptical model of legras  &  dritschel@xcite .",
    "when more complex vorticity structures have been considered , the action of an external straining flow has been found to strip off outer layers of vorticity leading to the steepening of vorticity gradients and consequently to structures that more closely resemble the uniform patches of vorticity that we consider here@xcite .    in section  [ sec : methods ] , we describe the elliptic model of melander , zabusky & styczek @xcite , and we also give a brief description of the contour dynamics method that can be used to calculate numerically the full evolution of patches of uniform vorticity .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : straight ] , we apply the elliptic model to the motion of an initially circular vortex patch in the vicinity of a straight boundary .",
    "the resulting motion is integrable , and is shown to reduce to the problem of an elliptic vortex patch in constant strain , which has been analysed by kida @xcite .",
    "comparison with contour dynamics solutions confirms that the elliptic model is a good approximation to the motion , even when the separation of the vortex patch from the boundary is comparable to the dimensions of the vortex patch . in section",
    "[ sec : corner ] , we consider the motion of a vortex patch around a corner , which is no longer integrable . the time scale associated with the rotation of the patch is found to be short compared to the time scale on which the straining flow experienced by the patch varies .",
    "this separation of time scales in a hamiltonian system implies the existence of an adiabatic invariant , which is an ( approximate ) constant of the motion@xcite .",
    "we briefly consider the effect of adding a background straining flow in section  [ sec : chaos ] .",
    "this flow can trap vortex patches in the corner .",
    "we use poincar sections to reveal the underlying chaotic nature of the elliptic model .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : island ] , we consider the deformation of a vortex patch due to a circular island . without a background flow , the motion around an island",
    "is found to be integrable . when a background flow is added , significant deformation , and possible breakup of vortex patches is observed as they are driven towards the boundary .",
    "a vortex patch of uniform vorticity , in the vicinity of a boundary , will generate a flow field @xmath0 which can be decomposed as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the flow field that the patch would generate in an unbounded geometry , and @xmath3 is the perturbation to that flow due to the presence of the boundary . for an elliptical vortex patch , @xmath2 simply causes the patch to rotate while remaining the same shape @xcite .",
    "the flow due to the boundary , @xmath3 , can be decomposed about the centre of the vortex patch as a uniform advection , a straining flow , and higher order corrections .",
    "the uniform advection simply translates the vortex patch with no change of shape .",
    "the straining flow will change the shape of the vortex patch , but an intially elliptical vortex patch will always remain elliptical in shape @xcite . thus , provided the higher order corrections can be safely neglected , the effect of a boundary on an initially circular vortex patch is to deform it into an elliptical shape .",
    "this observation motivates the use of an elliptic moment model to approximate the evolution of such a vortex patch .    when the boundary shape is sufficiently simple , the motion can be solved via the method of images . in this case , the motion is simply that of a collection of elliptical vortex patches .",
    "a hamiltonian elliptic moment model for such a collection of vortex patches was developed by melander , zabusky & styczek @xcite . in section  [ sec : elliptic_model_eqs ] we will recap the equations of motion associated with this model , but first , we briefly consider how to represent an elliptic shape mathematically .",
    "for an ellipse of area @xmath4 , two further independent quantities are needed to describe the shape . perhaps the simplest and most physically intuitive pairing is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the ratio of the length of the major axis of the ellipse to that of its minor axis , and @xmath7 is the angle that the major axis makes to some predetermined direction ( here we will always measure angles relative to the positive @xmath8-axis ) .",
    "a second representation can be obtained by considering the quadratic moment of an elliptic patch @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the centroid of the ellipse and the integral is taken over the area of the ellipse .",
    "this can of course be written in terms of @xmath11 and @xmath7 @xmath12 since there are three quantities @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 representing the shape , they can not all be independent ; they satisfy the relation @xmath16 .    to facilitate a compact representation of the elliptic model in the next section , we also define a matrix @xmath17 , closely related to @xmath18 , as @xmath19      the motion of well - separated elliptical vortex patches is approximated by the hamiltonian elliptic model of melander , zabusky & styczek @xcite .",
    "this model approximates the evolution of a collection of @xmath20 vortex patches with vorticity @xmath21 , area @xmath22 , centroid @xmath23 and elliptic shape @xmath24 .",
    "the associated hamiltonian is given by the excess energy of the system @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a stream function for the flow .",
    "each integral over a vortex patch can be evaluated as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the rate of strain at the centre of patch @xmath29 due to the leading - order point vortex contribution from patch @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the distance between the centres of patches @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and @xmath32 is the direction of @xmath33 .",
    "terms of order @xmath34 and higher are neglected in the calculation of the hamiltonian .",
    "this approximation is valid provided @xmath35 is large compared to the longest dimension of patches @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the hamiltonian consists of three parts : a ` self ' energy , a ` point ' energy and an ` elliptic ' energy .",
    "the self energy is associated with the self - induced rotation of the vortex patches .",
    "the point energy is associated with the leading - order motion of the patch centroids due to point vortex interactions .",
    "the elliptic energy is associated with changes in shape due to strain from other patches and also with the next - order corrections to the motion of the patch centroids .",
    "we choose to write the ` elliptic ' contribution to the hamiltonian in a slightly different form to that given by melander , zabusky & styczek .",
    "our form has the advantage of emphasising the role of strain in changing the shape of the ellipse .    the model is completed by the evolution equations    [ eqn : evolution ] @xmath36    melander , zabusky & styczek derive these equations by inspection from their approximation of the euler equations .",
    "alternatively , they can be derived directly from the hamiltonian formulation of the euler equations ( see meacham , morrison & flierl @xcite ) .",
    "we note that the model can be easily extended to include the effect of an irrotational background flow .",
    "the additional excess energy due to an irrotational background flow with stream function @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 the elliptic approximation is then obtained by evaluating these integrals and neglecting any moments that are higher than second order .",
    "a vital assumption in the use of this hamiltonian model is that the effects of viscosity can be neglected .",
    "viscosity causes the patch vorticity to diffuse outwards and leads to the formation of viscous boundary layers along fluid boundaries ; but perhaps most critically , it breaks the hamiltonian nature of the system .",
    "such effects can be neglected , and the system treated as hamiltonian , provided the appropriate reynolds numbers are large .",
    "a patch of vorticity @xmath39 and typical dimension @xmath40 generates a typical velocity @xmath41 .",
    "thus diffusion of the patch viscosity can be neglected provided the reynolds number @xmath42 is large .",
    "the effects of viscosity at fluid boundaries can also be neglected provided another reynolds number @xmath43 , based on the separation @xmath44 between the patch and the boundary , is also large .",
    "the elliptic model is only valid provided the vortex patches , or equivalently , the patch and boundary , are sufficiently far apart . in reality",
    ", this separation does not have to be very large for the model to be a very good approximation .",
    "nevertheless , it is informative to compare the model against the full solution .",
    "this full solution can be calculated relatively efficiently via the method of contour dynamics @xcite as briefly described below .",
    "the stream function due to a patch of uniform vorticity is given by an integral , over the area of the patch , of the point vortex green s function @xmath45 to calculate the fluid velocity due to this patch , derivatives of the stream function must be evaluated . in the contour dynamics method ,",
    "the divergence theorem is used to convert the expression for these derivatives from an integral over the area of the patch to an integral around the boundary of the patch : @xmath46 thus the velocity of points on the vortex patch boundaries , which are required to evolve the patch positions , can be calculated by integrating around only the boundaries of the vortex patches .",
    "the simplest interaction of a vortex patch with a boundary is the interaction with a straight boundary .",
    "the motion of a vortex patch in the half - plane @xmath47 above a boundary at @xmath48 is equivalent , via the method of images , to the motion of a vortex patch lying in @xmath47 combined with its mirror image in @xmath49 .",
    "this image lies in the half - plane @xmath50 and has the opposite sense of vorticity ( figure  [ fig : wall ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian for this system can be constructed using equation ( [ eqn : hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian is eight - dimensional with four parameters describing each of the original vortex patch and its image .",
    "the hamiltonian governing only the motion of the original patch can be obtained by writing the parameters of the image patch in terms of those of the original patch , and by considering only the excess energy associated with the half - plane @xmath47 , which is simply half the excess energy of the full plane .",
    "thus the hamiltonian for the original patch is @xmath51 where @xmath52 due to the translational symmetry of the geometry , the hamiltonian is independent of @xmath53 .",
    "this symmetry implies the existence of an additional conserved quantity , which is the distance @xmath54 from the boundary of the centroid of the ellipse . for the four dimensional elliptic model",
    ", the presence of an additional conserved quantity implies that the motion is integrable .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath54 is constant , the evolution of the elliptic shape is simply that of an elliptic vortex patch in a constant straining background flow .",
    "the steady solutions for an elliptic vortex patch in constant strain were found by moore & saffman @xcite .",
    "the unsteady case , which is of interest here , was later analysed by kida@xcite ( who actually analysed the more general problem of an ellipse in shear flow ) . we can recover his result for the subcase where there is no background vorticity by substituting in for @xmath17 and @xmath55 in equation  ( [ eqn : coast ] ) to obtain @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the strength of the straining flow , and @xmath58 is some function of the constants @xmath59 and @xmath54 .    -@xmath7 plane as predicted by the elliptic model with @xmath60 , corresponding to @xmath61 .",

    "any contour within this circular motion contour represents a nutating motion ( dot - dashed line ) .",

    "vortex patches are extended indefinitely.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    kida found that there are three fundamental types of motion possible : indefinite extension , in which the long axis of the ellipse aligns itself with the axis of extension of the strain ( @xmath63 ) and @xmath64 ; rotation , in which @xmath11 is bounded and @xmath7 varies monotonically ; and nutation , in which @xmath11 is bounded and @xmath7 oscillates about @xmath65 . for sufficiently strong strain , @xmath66 ,",
    "the only possibility is indefinite extension . for @xmath67",
    "both extension and nutation are possible .",

    "the model predicts that the patch is extended indefinitely when @xmath70.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    a quantitative measure of how much a boundary deforms vortex patches is the maximum deformation , as measured by @xmath11 , experienced by an intially circular vortex patch .",
    "an initially circular vortex patch , of radius @xmath40 , will be indefinitely extended if @xmath70 ( corresponding to @xmath71 ) or return to its original circular shape in a periodic motion if @xmath72 . for the latter case , figure  [ fig : wall_distortion ]",
    "shows the maximum deformation @xmath73 of the intially circular vortex patch in terms of the distance of its centroid from the boundary .",

    "the elliptic model is only valid if the vortex patch and its image are well separated , but in reality , it provides a good approximation to the motion of an initially circular vortex patch even when it is remarkably close to the boundary .",
    "figure  [ fig : near_wall ] shows the evolution of such a vortex patch with @xmath77 both under the elliptic model and the full contour dynamics solution .",

    ", when the contour dynamics solution shows that the vortex patch is stretched out into a non - elliptical shape , the elliptic model gives a remarkably good approximation to the overall region occupied by the vortex patch at short times ( figure  [ fig : wall_y1 ] ) .",

    "the two image vortex patches obtained from a single reflection have the opposite vorticity to the original patch , the third image patch has the same vorticity.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    since the motion above a straight boundary is periodic , the only way that large deformations to the vortex patch can occur is if the separation of the patch from the boundary is comparable to its radius . for more complicated boundaries , we might expect deformations to the patch shape to accumulate over time . in which case ,",
    "even vortex patches whose separation from the boundary is large compared to their radius could eventually accumulate large deformations .",
    "this motivates us to consider the motion of a vortex patch in a quarter plane ( @xmath79 and @xmath47 ) .    since a quarter plane does not possess the translational symmetry of the half plane , the motion of a vortex patch within a quarter plane is unlikely to be integrable under the elliptic model",
    "this could be determined by a melnikov analysis , although such analyses in the present context can have special difficulties .",

    "two reflections must be made : one in @xmath48 , and one in @xmath80 ( figure  [ fig : corner_images ] ) .",
    "this gives three image vortex patches , two of which have opposite vorticity to the original patch .",
    "the hamiltonian for the motion of the original patch ( a quarter of the excess energy for the full plane with images ) is given by @xmath81 where the strain rate @xmath82 now depends on both @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    "figure  [ fig : corner ] shows the evolution of an initially circular vortex patch with @xmath93 moving around the corner .",
    "the most notable feature of this evolution is the similarity of the periodic variation of @xmath11 with @xmath94 before and after the interaction with the corner region .",
    "the motion afterwards is almost exactly the same , periodically circular , motion that the vortex patch was executing before it approached the corner .",
    "this similarity suggests that @xmath95 , and indeed we find that @xmath96 .",
    "the approximate equality between @xmath88 and @xmath87 , and the corresponding similar periodic evolution of @xmath11 , are generic .",
    "it appears to occur for all initially circular patches with @xmath97 , i.e.  all initially circular patches that are not indefinitely extended when at a similar separation from a straight boundary ( figure  [ fig : wall_distortion ] ) .",
    "the explanation for this phenomenon lies in the existence of an adiabatic invariant .",
    "adiabatic invariance occurs for two - dimensional hamiltonian systems within a slowly varying environment . due to",
    "the separation of time scales between the motion of the system and the variation of its environment there exists an ( approximate ) invariant of the motion referred to as the adiabatic invariant@xcite . strictly speaking ,",
    "the adiabatic invariant is not an invariant but rather a quantity which varies by only a very small amount .",
    "it is constant to all orders in @xmath98 , where @xmath98 is defined to be the small ratio of the time scale of the system to the time scale on which the environment varies , but can vary by an exponentially small amount .",
    "returning to an elliptic vortex patch in a quarter plane , we observe that there are two time scales associated with the motion of the vortex around the corner : the time scale on which the patch rotates , @xmath99 ; and the time time scale on which the strain experienced by the patch varies , @xmath100 . from figure",
    "[ fig : corner](b ) , we see that @xmath99 is the shorter of these two time scales .",
    "the variation in strain is largely confined to the period @xmath101 but during this period the patch rotates multiple times .",
    "this separation of time scales , while not an order of magnitude , is still sufficient to lead to the phenomenon of adiabatic invariance .",

    "( b ) the difference in action @xmath103 before and after the corner is shown for patches whose centroid speed is modified by a factor of @xmath104 .",
    "these values of @xmath103 are calculated from a root mean square average over @xmath105 of the difference in action for all vortex patches with the same initial action and energy ( and consequently separation from the wall ) as the patch shown in figure [ fig : corner ] .",
    "the difference @xmath103 decreases exponentially as @xmath106 is increased ( corresponding to @xmath98 being decreased ) , which is consistent with adiabatic behaviour . ]",
    "the separation of time scales allows us to consider the evolution of the vortex patch shape as a two - dimensional dynamical system with a slowly varying parameter instead of as part of the full four - dimensional elliptic model .",
    "this slowly varying parameter is the strain rate @xmath55 experienced by the vortex patch .",
    "the hamiltonian for the two - dimensional system is given by @xmath107 we write @xmath108 , where @xmath109 , to emphasise that the variation in strain rate is slow compared to the rotation of the patch .",
    "the theory of adiabatic invariance applies to this system and implies the existence of an adiabatic invariant that is constant to all orders in @xmath98 .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath55 is constant , the value of this adiabatic invariant is simply given by the action @xmath110 where @xmath111 are canonical variables for the hamiltonian system @xcite .    sufficiently far before and after the corner , the strain experienced by the patch , and hence the action , are constant .",
    "we define @xmath112 to be the action before , and @xmath113 to be the action afterwards .",

    "the resulting variation of @xmath103 with @xmath106 is shown in figure  [ fig : corner_action](b ) .",
    "there is an exponential decrease as @xmath106 is increased , which confirms that @xmath103 is constant to all orders in @xmath98 .",
    "the phenomenon of adiabatic invariance will not be limited to this particular boundary shape , but rather can be expected to occur for any boundary shape along which the motion of vortex patches satisfies @xmath121 .",
    "adiabatic invariance could be broken by a boundary with variations in shape on a scale much less than the dimensions of the vortex patch , since @xmath100 will be greatly reduced for such a boundary .",
    "however , fluctuations in the straining flow due to short scale boundary variations can be expected to decay exponentially with distance from the boundary on the same scale as the boundary variations ( cf .",
    "solutions of laplace s equation with sinusoidal boundary conditions ) .",
    "thus the straining flow generated by such boundary variations will be exponentially small for any vortex patch whose separation from the boundary is large compared to its radius .",
    "we conclude that there are two possible scenarios for vortex patches in the vicinity of a boundary ( in the absence of a background flow ) : either the separation of the vortex patch from the boundary is comparable to its radius , in which case the vortex patch will undergo significant ( order one ) deformations to its shape ( figure  [ fig : wall_distortion ] ) ; or the separation of the vortex patch from the boundary is large compared to its radius , in which case the initial deformation to the shape of the vortex patch is small , and , due to the existence of an adiabatic invariant , will remain small .",
    "in particular , every time the patch returns to a straight section of boundary , its separation from the boundary and the periodically varying evolution of its shape must be very nearly the same .",

    "the elliptic model for the motion of a vortex patch in the vicinity of a boundary is four - dimensional , and a generic feature of such four - dimensional dynamical systems is chaotic behaviour . in the examples that we have considered so far , any chaotic behaviour has been suppressed either by the motion being integrable , or by the presence of an adiabatic invariant . to demonstrate that chaotic behaviour is possible under the elliptic model",
    ", we briefly consider the motion of a vortex patch trapped in a corner by a background straining flow .",
    "if a pure straining flow , with stream function @xmath124 , is added to the quarter plane geometry of the previous section , then the straining flow can trap vortex patches in the corner provided the sign of @xmath125 is appropriately chosen .",
    "figure  [ fig : corner_strain](a ) shows the streamlines for this background flow , and figure  [ fig : corner_strain](b ) shows representative paths of vortex patches approximated as point vortices , which are trapped in the corner .",

    "the poincar section reveals chaotic behaviour .",
    "resonances have opened up in some of the previously circular contours , and a ` sea of chaos ' has formed around the edge of the region . ]    the resulting motion of the elliptic vortex patches can be visualised via a poincar section .",
    "two such poincar sections are shown in figure  [ fig : corner_psections ] for the case @xmath130 .",
    "each poincar section visualises the motion of several vortex patches , each with the same excess energy @xmath59 , and depicts the points at which the angle @xmath7 of a vortex patch passed forwards through @xmath65 .",
    "there is no chaotic behaviour visible for the lower value of @xmath59 shown in figure  [ fig : corner_psections](a ) .",
    "however , for the larger value of @xmath59 shown in figure  [ fig : corner_psections](b ) , two signs of chaotic behaviour are clearly visible : resonances and a ` sea of chaos ' @xcite . those patches whose motions form the the sea of chaos still orbit the central stagnation point , but",
    "the path of the patch centroid can differ significantly between consecutive orbits .",
    "since the patch energy is constant , there must be a significant change of patch shape associated with this change of centroid position .",
    "the motion shown in figure  [ fig : corner_psections](b ) is actually unphysical due to the intersection of some of the elliptic vortex patches with the boundary of the domain ; and we were unable to find any values of @xmath125 and @xmath59 that exhibited such clear chaotic behaviour without also being unphysical .",
    "nevertheless , these results are informative since they emphasise the significance of the suppression of chaotic behaviour by adiabatic invariance that was observed in the preceding section .",
    "we now consider the deformation of a vortex patch in the vicinity of a circular island .",

    "such an analysis is shown in figure  [ fig : island_flow_distortion ] for the case @xmath142 .",

    "meanwhile , for large background flow speeds ( @xmath167 ) , the vorticity of the patch has very little effect on the motion and the centres of the vortex patches follow paths closer to those shown in figure  [ fig : island_flow](a ) . in this ` ballistic ' regime , those vortex patches that get deformed significantly correspond to vortex patches whose impact height is in , or close to , the range of impact heights covered by the island .      .",

    "the full solution , calculated for selected values of @xmath158 with @xmath154 and @xmath142 , is shown in figure  [ fig : island_u01 ] . from this figure",
    ", we note that the elliptic model is in good agreement with the full solution when @xmath171 . for those values of @xmath158 for which patches are indefinitely extended under the elliptic model ( @xmath172 for this choice of parameters ) ,",
    "the full solutions shown in figure  [ fig : island_u01 ] reveal two possible behaviours : patches are either distorted into a non - elliptical shape , before returning to an approximately circular shape downstream ; or , for an intermediate range of release heights , they are broken up as they get extended around both the top and bottom of the island .",
    "we have investigated the deformation of two - dimensional patches of uniform vorticity in the vicinity of fluid boundaries both via the hamiltonian elliptic model of melander , zabusky and styczek , and via contour dynamics simulations . for a straight boundary ,",
    "the distance of the vortex patch centroid from the boundary is fixed and the motion is integrable under the elliptic model .",
    "in fact , the problem reduces to the well known problem of an elliptic vortex patch in a constant straining flow as analysed by kida @xcite .",
    "the elliptic model is a good approximation to the full solution even when the separation of the elliptic patch from the boundary is comparable to the dimensions of the patch .",
    "as the patch is moved away from the boundary , the straining flow generated by its image falls off as the inverse square of its distance from the boundary .",
    "consequently , there is a rapid decrease in the deformation of the patch with distance from the boundary .",
    "the motion of a vortex patch in a quarter plane demonstrates nonintegrable behaviour under the elliptic model .",
    "however , due to a separation in time scales between the time scale on which the patch rotates and the time scale on which the straining flow experienced by the patch varies ( the former being shorter than the latter ) , there is an adiabatic invariant . the existence of an adiabatic invariant acts to limit the deformation of vortex patches by preventing the accumulation of small deformations over time .",
    "we expect the motion of a vortex patch along boundaries with more complicated shapes to be similarly limited by the presence of an adiabatic invariant . when a background straining flow is added to the quarter plane geometry , vortex patches can become trapped in the corner region .",
    "poincar sections of vortex patches in this system , evolving under the elliptic model , reveal the model s chaotic nature .",
    "we also investigated the deformation of a vortex patch in the vicinity of a circular island both with and without a background flow . without a background flow ,",
    "the motion of a vortex patch around a circular island is integrable under the elliptic model .",
    "the amount of deformation caused by an island is less than that caused by a straight boundary to a vortex patch at a similar separation , and increasingly so as the island radius is decreased .",
    "the amount of deformation also falls off more rapidly with distance from the island : the straining flow due to an island falls off asymptotically as the inverse fourth power of the separation between the patch and the island compared to an inverse square fall - off for a straight boundary . when a background flow is added , significant deformation of vortex patches is possible as they are driven towards the island boundary .",
    "the addition of an irrotational background flow that tends to uniform flow away from the island leads to three possible evolutions of vortex patches under the elliptic model : as they are advected towards the island , vortex patches either pass above the island , pass below the island , or are indefinitely extended .",
    "for those vortex patches that the elliptic model predicts are indefinitely extended , a closer examination using the full contour dynamics solution reveals two possible behaviours : either vortex patches are deformed into a strongly non - elliptical shape before passing around one side of the island and returning to an approximately circular shape downstream ; or part of the vortex patch is split as part passes above the island and part passes below .",
    "since the image vorticity distribution for a uniform vorticity patch outside a circular island has non - uniform vorticity , the derivation of the contour dynamics method for such a domain is more complicated .",
    "in fact , it is possible to apply the contour dynamics method to any finitely connected planar domain , as shown by crowdy and surana @xcite , but here we just give a brief derivation of the result for a circular island .",
    "the streamfunction at @xmath132 due to both the self vorticity and the image vorticity of a vortex patch of vorticity @xmath39 occupying an area @xmath4 outside an island of radius @xmath135 is given by @xmath173 the velocity is given by derivatives of the stream function , and the contour dynamics method consists of converting the resulting area integrals into integrals about the vortex patch boundary . taking a spatial derivative , and splitting into to contributions from the self and image vorticity gives @xmath174 in order to rewrite the second term , which represents the image vorticity , as a boundary integral , we rearrange it as @xmath175 this allows both derivatives with respect to @xmath132 to be rewritten as derivatives with respect to the dummy variable @xmath176 @xmath177 then , applying the divergence theorem , these area integrals can be rewritten as integrals around the boundary of the vortex patch @xmath178 which is the desired contour dynamics formulation .    the authors would like to thank the woods hole oceanographic institute whose geophysical fluid dynamics program provided the inspiration and basis for the preceding research .",
