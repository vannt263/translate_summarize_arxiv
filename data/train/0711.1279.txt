    "an intriguing idea in modern cosmology is the possibility that the universe may have a higher number of dimensions than the classically observed @xmath1 .",
    "there has been a number of motivations for this idea , mainly related to attempts at constructing a fundamental theory of physical interactions .",
    "these range from the original attempts at unification of gravity with electromagnetism by kaluza and klein @xcite to string / m - theory randall , sms , maartensrev .",
    "an immediate task within this higher dimensional framework is how to explain the four dimensionality of the observed universe . an original idea - which dates back to the work of kaluza and klein - assumes these extra dimensions to be compact and very small . in most recent braneworld models , on the other hand ,",
    "stringy effects are invoked to argue that in low energy regimes particles are restricted to a special @xmath4 _ brane _ hypersurface , which is embedded in a higher - dimensional _ bulk _ , while the gravitational field is free to propagate in the bulk @xcite .",
    "the intense recent interest in the higher - dimensional scenarios has also provided strong motivation to look for geometrical mechanisms which could allow confinement and this has led to the investigation of the so - called warped product spaces @xcite and their geometrical properties .",
    "originally most braneworld and higher dimensional studies concentrated on @xmath5 scenarios , i.e. co - dimensional one models .",
    "however , given the prediction of the string theory , according to which spacetime is 10-dimensional , the study of higher co - dimensional models is urgently called for .",
    "increasing effort has recently gone into the study of such models ( see for e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "an important question concerning such models , specially from an observational point of view , is the behaviour of the geodesics in these models , and in particular the relation between the geodesics of the higher - dimensional space and those belonging to the hypersurface .",
    "a great deal of effort has recently gone into the study of geodesic motions in five - dimensional spaces @xcite .",
    "recently the authors studied the ability of five - dimensional warped product spaces to provide a mechanism for geodesic confinement on co - dimension one hypersurfaces , purely classically and based on gravitational effects @xcite .",
    "the aim of this article is to generalise that analysis to the case of co - dimension @xmath2 warped product spaces @xcite .",
    "we do this by studying the classical geodesic motions of nonzero rest mass test particles and photons in @xmath0-dimensional warped product spaces .",
    "we show that it is possible to obtain a general picture of these motions , using the natural decoupling that occurs in such spaces between the motions in the @xmath2 extra dimensions and the motion in the @xmath6 submanifolds .",
    "this splitting allows the use of phase space analysis in order to investigate the possibility of confinement and the stability of motion of particles and photons to submanifolds in such @xmath7-dimensional spaces .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we write the geodesic equations for warped product spaces and consider the parts due to 4d and the higher dimensions separately .",
    "we then show that the equations that describe the motion in higher dimensions decouples from the rest .",
    "we proceed in section 3 to find the mathematical conditions that must be satisfied by the warping function @xmath8 in order for timelike and null geodesics of the higher - dimensional space to be confined to @xmath9 . in section 4",
    "we rewrite the geodesic equations in the higher dimensions as an autonomous @xmath10-dimensional dynamical system .",
    "we then employ phase plane analysis to study the motion of particles with nonzero rest mass ( timelike geodesics ) and photons ( null geodesics ) respectively .",
    "such qualitative analysis allows a number of conclusions to be drawn about the possible existence of confined motions and their nature in the neighbourhood of hypersurfaces . in section 5",
    "we give an  analysis of the motion in the extra dimensions by reducing the problem to the motion of a particle subjected to the action of an effective potential and illustrate the method with an example from the literature .",
    "we conclude in section 6 with some final remarks .",
    "in general a warped product space is defined in the following way .",
    "let @xmath11 and @xmath12 be two  riemannian ( or pseudo - riemannian ) manifolds of dimension @xmath13 and @xmath2 , with metrics @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "let @xmath16 be a smooth function ( which we shall refer to as the warping function ) .",
    "we can then construct a new warped product riemannian ( pseudo - riemannian ) space by setting @xmath17 and defining a metric @xmath18 . in this paper",
    "we shall take @xmath19 and identify @xmath9 with the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional _ spacetime , _  a four - dimensional lorentzian manifold  with signature @xmath20 .",
    "therefore the class of warped geometries which we shall consider can be characterised by the following line element @xmath21where @xmath22 , @xmath23 @xmath24 and @xmath25 is in general an @xmath2-dimensional riemannian metric , lower case latin indices take values in the range @xmath26 while greek indices run over @xmath27thus , the coordinates of a generic point @xmath28 of the manifold @xmath29 will be denoted by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 denotes the 4d spacetime coordinates and @xmath32 refers to the @xmath33 extra coordinates of @xmath28 . ] .",
    "let us now consider the equations of geodesics in the @xmath34-dimensional space @xmath29 @xmath35where @xmath36 is an affine parameter and @xmath37 are the christoffel symbols of the second kind defined by @xmath38 . after some algebra it is not difficult to show that the geodesic equations for the 4d part can be written in the form    @xmath39    where @xmath40and @xmath41 .",
    "likewise the extra - dimensional part of the geodesic equations ( geodesic ) may be written as @xmath42where @xmath43    we now assume that our spacetime @xmath9 corresponds in this scenario to a particular submanifold defined by the @xmath2 equations @xmath44constant .  the geometry of @xmath9 is then determined by the induced metric @xmath45 therefore the quantities @xmath46 which appear on the left - hand side of eq.([4dequations ] ) may be identified with the christoffel symbols associated with the metric induced on the leaves of the foliation defined above .    for the warped product space ( [ warpedmetric ] )",
    "the quantities @xmath47 and @xmath48 reduce respectively to @xmath49and @xmath50where @xmath51 , a dot denotes differentiation with respect to the affine parameter @xmath36 and we are using the notation @xmath52 . note that if the warping function @xmath53 is constant the equations ( [ geodesic ] ) which describe the geodesics of the entire warped product @xmath29 separates into the geodesic equations for the two submanifolds @xmath9 and @xmath54 . on the other hand if we restrict ourselves to the class of timelike or null geodesics of @xmath29 we have the following first integral @xmath55where @xmath56 in the case of particles with nonzero rest mass and @xmath57 in the case of photons . with the help of the above first integral it is now possible to decouple the motion in the extra dimensions from the spacetime .",
    "thus the geodesic equations ( [ geodesic ] ) finally take the form @xmath58@xmath59these equations constitute a system of second - order ordinary differential equations which can , in principle , be solved once the function @xmath60 is given .",
    "in this section we wish to investigate the possibility of confinement  of massive particles and photons in the spacetime manifold @xmath9 . this amounts to finding the mathematical conditions required to be satisfied by the warping function @xmath8  such that timelike and null geodesics of @xmath29coincide with those corresponding to @xmath9 . in general such submanifolds of a riemannian  ( or pseudo - riemannian )",
    "manifold @xmath29 are referred to as totally geodesic . in the case where @xmath29 is a riemannian space , then according to a theorem of differential geometry the submanifold @xmath9 is totally geodesic if and only if all normal curvatures ( or extrinsic curvatures ) of @xmath9 vanish @xcite .",
    "if the geometry of @xmath29 is pseudo - riemannian ( in our case @xmath29 is a lorentzian warped product space ) then , as we shall show below , the theorem is still valid , however the confinement of null geodesics does not depend on the value of the normal curvatures of the submanifold @xmath9 . from a physical standpoint it is interesting that for the large class of warped product spaces  defined by the equation ( [ warpedmetric ] ) the motion of photons is not constrained by the extrinsic ( or normal ) curvature of the spacetime .",
    "this result generalises a recent result of the authors concerning the embeddings of hypersurfaces with codimension one @xcite .    to show this , consider equations ( [ spacetime ] ) and ( [ extradim1 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath61  be a timelike ( or spacelike ) geodesic curve of the submanifold @xmath9 . since @xmath62 we must have @xmath63 , which implies that ( [ spacetime ] ) is identically satisfied . now",
    "if @xmath64 , then ( [ extradim1 ] ) also holds .",
    "therefore eq .",
    "( [ geodesic ] ) is satisfied , implying that @xmath61 is a geodesic of @xmath29 .",
    "conversely , if any geodesic @xmath61 of @xmath29 with parametric equations @xmath65 is a geodesic of @xmath9 then from ( [ extradim1 ] ) we must have @xmath64 .",
    "let us now calculate the normal curvatures of @xmath9 . from ( [ warpedmetric ] )",
    "we see that the vectors @xmath66 ( where no summation is implied over the index @xmath67 ) are normal to the submanifold @xmath68 let @xmath61  be a curve of @xmath9 with tangent vector given by @xmath69 .",
    "the normal curvature of @xmath70 at a point @xmath71 in the direction of @xmath72 is given by the inner product @xmath73 at @xmath74 , where @xmath75 denotes the covariant derivative of @xmath76 with respect to the levi - civita connection determined by @xmath77 .",
    "after computing @xmath78 from ( [ warpedmetric ] ) we can easily show that @xmath79where , again , no summation over index @xmath67 is intended .",
    "thus the coefficients of the normal curvature @xmath80 are given by @xmath81 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath82 if and only if @xmath83 therefore , in view of the above we conclude the following : _ timelike or spacelike geodesics can be confined to the submanifold _",
    "@xmath9 _ _  if and only if the normal curvature of _ _ @xmath9 _ _  vanishes__@xmath84 it is interesting to ask what happens in the case of null geodesics .",
    "now since for a curve @xmath61 to be a null geodesic of @xmath9 @xmath85 needs to be zero , equations ( spacetime ) and ( [ extradim1 ] ) imply that @xmath61 would also be a geodesic of @xmath29 , irrespective of the value of @xmath86 , and hence irrespective of the value of the normal curvatures of @xmath9 .",
    "thus the motion of photons in this setting is not constrained by the extrinsic curvature of the hypersurface .",
    "the discussion of the geodesics in the previous section allows this theorem to be generalised to cases where the geometry of the ambient space @xmath29 is riemannian and the hypersurface under consideration is replaced by a submanifold of codimension @xmath2 .",
    "this can be readily seen from eqs .",
    "( extradim1 ) by noting that the condition for the vanishing of the extrinsic ( normal ) curvatures in this case is given by @xmath87 which ensures that the 4d part of the geodesic eqs .",
    "( [ extradim1 ] ) is geodesic .",
    "the above results give the conditions for the geodesics of the higher dimensional space @xmath29 to be confined to the co - dimension @xmath2 hypersurface , but do not give any information concerning the stability of such a confinement .",
    "we shall consider this question in the following sections , using a phase space analysis .",
    "this generalises a recent result of the authors concerning the embeddings of hypersurfaces with codimension one drst .",
    "defining @xmath88 allows the equations ( extradim1 )  to be expressed as an autonomous dynamical system given by @xmath89where @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 , with @xmath93 . writing the equations as a dynamical system allows the equilibrium points ( given here by @xmath94 ) as well as their stabilities to be studied .",
    "these in turn allow a great deal of information to be gained regarding the types of behaviour allowed by the system ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "let us start with the investigation of the motion of massive particles . for simplicity we shall first consider the case where the metric @xmath25 is euclidean , i.e. @xmath96 .",
    "it is then easy to see that the equilibrium points exist if the simultaneous equations @xmath87 have real roots ( which we denote by @xmath97 ) .",
    "the equilibrium points are then given by @xmath98 .",
    "the nature as well as the stability of these equilibrium points can be obtained by linearising equations ( [ dynamical ] ) and studying the eigenvalues of the corresponding jacobian matrix about the equilibrium points . in this case",
    "this is a @xmath99 matrix given by    @xmath100    0.1 in where @xmath101 , and @xmath102 and @xmath103 are zero and unit @xmath104 matrices respectively .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the determinant and the trace of @xmath105 ( @xmath106 and @xmath107 ) are given , respectively , by @xmath108 @xmath86 and @xmath109 .    for general forms of the warping function",
    "the eigenvalues of the system will satisfy a polynomial of order @xmath10 which would be difficult to analyse analytically .",
    "our primary aim here , however , is see whether the system is in principle capable of providing confinement of particles in the neighbourhood of the spacetime @xmath1 hypersurface in the co - dimension @xmath2 setting . thus rather than pursuing the general case we shall ask whether there are classes of special warping functions @xmath8 for which such confinement is possible .    as an example we shall consider the cases where @xmath110 computed at the equilibrium points is zero for all @xmath111 and real positive numbers for @xmath112 . in such cases",
    "the matrix simplifies and the eigenvalues ( all of which turn out to be pure imaginary ) can be readily found : @xmath113where no summation is intended over @xmath67 .",
    "this condition would clearly be satisfied for warping functions of the type @xmath114where @xmath2 is a positive integer .",
    "writing the system ( [ dynamical ] ) with ( [ mat ] ) in terms of normal coordinates , allows it to be expressed in terms of de - coupled harmonic oscillators : @xmath115where @xmath116 and again no summation is intended over @xmath117 .",
    "thus in such co - dimension @xmath2 cases , one can view the motion in extra dimensions as confined to n - tori .",
    "this generalises the case of the centre equilibrium point that was found in the co - dimension one case recently drst and amounts to a _ toroidal confinement _ of particles in the neighbourhood of the spacetime hypersurface .",
    "an analysis of the motion in the extra dimensions can also be carried out by reducing the problem to the motion of a particle subjected to the action of an _ effective potential _ @xmath118 .",
    "for generality in this section we shall assume that the metric @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ warpedmetric ] ) is a riemannian ( positive - definite ) metric .",
    "the geodesic equations for the extra dimensions part are given by @xmath119 in these coordinates equation ( [ firstintegral ] ) becomes @xmath120which again allows the decoupling of the motion in the extra dimensions with equations@xmath121a first integral of the above equation may be found by multiplying ( extradmotion1 ) by the factor @xmath122 to give @xmath123which , in turn , gives @xmath124integrating we obtain @xmath125now , if we assume that @xmath126 , then it follows that@xmath127where _",
    "_  _ _ @xmath128 _ _  _ _ is related to the initial kinetic energy corresponding to the motion in the extra dimensions . _ _  _ _ thus , we have@xmath129where _ _  _ _ @xmath130 _ _  _ _ can be treated as an effective _  potential energy _ given by @xmath131given that the metric @xmath25 is positive - definite the motion is not allowed in the region where @xmath132 . on the other hand , the particle may be bound to @xmath133 in the neighbourhood of @xmath134  if @xmath134is a point of minimum of @xmath135 we note , however , that in cases where the embedding of the submanifold @xmath9 has codimension greater than one  we can have bounded motion without the particle crossing the brane .    as a simple example we consider the case corresponding to an embedding of @xmath136 with codimension two , that is , @xmath137 .",
    "let us assume the geometry of @xmath138 is given by the line element @xmath139clearly we can interpret the _ radial _ coordinate @xmath140 as related to the distance between the points of @xmath29 and the submanifold @xmath9 , while the function @xmath141 gives a measure of the non - euclideanicity of the metric @xmath142 . also since two - dimensional riemannian manifolds are conformally flat , any two - dimensional metric @xmath25 can locally be put in the form ( [ 2dmetric ] ) , but in general with @xmath143 @xcite .",
    "we now make the assumption , which in this case seems to be rather natural , that the warping function @xmath8 is also a function of @xmath140 , that is , @xmath144 . with these assumptions",
    "the equation of the motion ( [ vpotential ] ) yields @xmath145from the equation of motion ( [ extradmotion1 ] ) for @xmath146 , we get the following constant of the motion:@xmath147 in this way , the equation for the radial motion reduces to @xmath148here @xmath149 can be thought of as being related to the angular momentum of the motion of the particle around the submanifold @xmath9 .",
    "clearly the existence of bounded states depends upon the behaviour of the effective potential@xmath150    we shall end this section by deducing some general properties of the motion .",
    "let us assume that @xmath151 and that @xmath152 is regular and does not vanish at the origin , since otherwise the metric @xmath77 would not be well defined at the spacetime @xmath9 . now",
    "if @xmath153 then the dominant term in the potential @xmath154 in the limit @xmath155 is @xmath156 .",
    "we therefore have our first result ( which is physically obvious ) thus : if @xmath153 , then the particle can not return to the submanifold , whether or not its motion corresponds to a bound state . on the other hand , for @xmath157 , @xmath154 acts as confining potential ( for any value of @xmath158 ) if asymptotically ( as @xmath159 ) , we have @xmath160 .    as a simple application of this result ,",
    "let us consider a particular case found in the literature @xcite , in which the functions @xmath161 and @xmath141 are explicitly given by @xmath162@xmath163where @xmath67 and @xmath164 are real constants . in this case",
    "the effective potential is given by @xmath165 + l^{2}\\frac{(c^{2}+ar^{2})(c^{2}+r^{2})}{c^{4}r^{2}}\\]]the behaviour of @xmath154 is displayed in the fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , for two different values of the parameter @xmath149 . the upper curve ( with @xmath166 ) corresponds to the case where @xmath167 as @xmath168 and hence the particle can not cross the submanifold @xmath9 , despite the fact that it might be in a bound state .",
    "the lower curve ( with @xmath157 ) , on the other hand , corresponds to the case where the particle is confined to @xmath9 .     for different values of @xmath149 . for the upper curve ( with @xmath166 ) ,",
    "@xmath169 as @xmath155 , implying that the particle can not cross the submanifold @xmath9 .",

    ", there exists a limiting value of the kinetic energy above which the particle will escape to infinity .",
    "in this paper we have examined some aspects of the motion of massive particles and photons in a @xmath0-dimensional warped product spaces .",
    "spaces of this type , where the codimension of the embedding is one or two , have received a great deal of attention over the recent years mainly in connection with the so - called braneworld scenarios .",
    "our treatment has been geometrical and classical in nature .",
    "we have derived the conditions under which timelike and spacelike geodesics in the full space @xmath29 coincide with those on the codimension @xmath2 hypersurface .",
    "we also have shown that the motion of photons does not depend on the extrinsic curvature . employing the splitting that naturally occurs in such spaces between the motion in the hypersurface and the remaining dimensions , and using plane analysis ,",
    "further allows the stability of such a confinement to be also studied . using this approach , we have found a novel form of quasi - confinement ( namely toroidal confinement ) which is neutrally stable .",
    "the importance of such confinements is that they are due purely to the classical gravitational effects , without requiring the presence of brane type confinement mechanisms .    finally in connection with our results regarding the conditions that need to be satisfied by a warped product space in order to ensure the confinement and stability of geodesic motions",
    ", we would like to mention a recent work @xcite , in which the author considers an analogous question .",
    "however , although this analysis is quite general , the author restricts himself to the case of codimension one embedding . both approaches would essentially lead to same results when the warped space is taken to be five - dimensional .",
