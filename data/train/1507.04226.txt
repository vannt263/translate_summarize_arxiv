    "understanding fluctuations far from equilibrium defines a key topic of nonequilibrium statistical physics .",
    "a new line of activities started about three decades ago by discovering different forms of fluctuation relations ( frs ) which generalize fundamental laws of thermodynamics to small systems in nonequilibrium ; see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews and further references therein .",
    "more recently these laws got unified by over - arching schemes , most notably the deterministic dissipation function approach by evans and coworkers @xcite , and by stochastic thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "the latter theory starts from defining entropy production on the level of individual trajectories in stochastic models such as langevin and master equations .",
    "given that stochastic thermodynamics is based on rather simple markov models one may ask to which extent frs derived from it are reproduced if the dynamics is more complicated . in our paper we address this problem by testing frs for stochastic dynamics that is anomalous due to non - markovian dynamical correlations and/or strongly non - gaussian pdfs .",
    "anomalous dynamics has been observed in many experiments and is widely studied by the theory of anomalous stochastic processes @xcite .",
    "a characteristic property of anomalous dynamics is that the mean square displacement ( msd ) grows nonlinearly in time yielding anomalous diffusion in the long time limit @xcite .",
    "in contrast , markovian dynamics like brownian motion generates a msd that increases linearly for long times . if the msd grows faster than linear one speaks of superdiffusion , if it grows slower than linear one obtains subdiffusion .",
    "there are many different ways to model anomalous stochastic dynamics such as continuous time random walks ( ctrw ) @xcite , generalized langevin equations @xcite , lvy flights and walks @xcite , fractional diffusion equations @xcite , scaled brownian motion @xcite and heterogeneous diffusion processes @xcite , to name a few .",
    "the study of frs for anomalous stochastic processes appears to be rather at the beginning : crooks and jarzynski work relations as well as transient and steady state fluctuation theorems have been confirmed for non - markovian gaussian dynamics modelled by generalized langevin equations with memory kernels , given specific conditions are fulfilled @xcite .",
    "these results have been reproduced and generalized by a stochastic thermodynamics approach @xcite . for non - gaussian pdfs generated by langevin equations with non - gaussian noise , such as lvy noise or poissonian shot noise , violations of conventional steady state and transient frs",
    "have been reported @xcite . for a ctrw model with a power law waiting time distribution",
    "it was found that the steady state frs may or may not hold depending on the exponent of the waiting time distribution @xcite .",
    "computer simulations of glassy dynamics exhibiting anomalous diffusion also showed violations of transient fluctuation relations @xcite . in @xcite",
    "several of the above types of stochastic dynamics including fractional fokker - planck equations were considered .",
    "it was found that the validity of fluctuation - dissipation relations @xcite for a given anomalous stochastic process plays a crucial role for the validity or violation of conventional frs .    in this article",
    "we test transient fluctuation relations ( tfrs ) for a class of anomalous stochastic processes that so far has not been in the focus of investigations , which are time - fractional fokker - planck equations ( ffpes ) .",
    "such equations model the emergence of non - gaussian pdfs by using power law memory kernels via time - fractional derivatives @xcite .",
    "they need to be distinguished from equations modeling correlations in space via space - fractional derivatives as they naturally arise , e.g. , for generating lvy flights @xcite .",
    "ffpe can be derived from stochastic equations of motion either by ctrws @xcite or by subordinated langevin dynamics @xcite .",
    "quite a variety of them have been studied in the literature , both from a purely theoretical point of view and with respect to applications to experiments : prominent examples are fractional klein - kramers equations that were used to analyse biological cell migration data @xcite .",
    "another type was designed to model the dynamics of tracer particles in random environments @xcite .",
    "closely related time - fractional diffusion equations @xcite have been used to model a variety of different processes , from diffusion in crowded cellular environments @xcite to geophysical and environmental systems @xcite .",
    "they have also been derived for weakly chaotic dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "a bifractional diffusion equation famously reproduced the spreading of dollar bills in the united states @xcite .",
    "our paper is structured as follows : in section  2 we discuss three types of ffpes which differ from each other in terms of their anomalous diffusive properties , and by whether or not they fulfill fluctuation - dissipation relations .",
    "we solve these models for their position pdfs and study their properties both analytically and numerically . in section  3",
    "we test the ( work ) tfr for our three models by analytical asymptotic expansions and by numerically plotting the results .",
    "we conclude with a summary and an outlook towards physical applications in section  4 .",
    "this section introduces to three different types of ffpes : we first outline how starting from stochastic dynamics a ffpe generating superdiffusion can be constructed in the form of an overdamped langevin equation with correlated noise .",
    "our argument illustrates how a time - fractional derivative naturally emerges from modelling power law time correlation decay .",
    "the other two types of ffpes that we consider have already been derived in the literature from ctrw theory and are either subdiffusive or exhibit a transition from sub- to superdiffusion under parameter variation .",
    "we analytically calculate the first and second moments for all three models , which enables us to check for the validity of the fluctuation - dissipation relation of the first kind ( fdr1 )",
    ". we also comment on the galilean invariance of our models .",
    "we then analytically calculate the position pdfs of all ffpes and study the solutions numerically by plotting the results .",
    "the study of an overdamped langevin equation for the position @xmath0 of a particle on the line driven by a correlated stochastic process and an external force allows to gain insight into the origin of a superdiffusive ffpe .",
    "our langevin equation of interest is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes a constant external force , @xmath3 a friction coefficient and @xmath4 the mass of the particle .",
    "we assume that @xmath5 is a stationary correlated stochastic process with zero mean @xmath6 and a power - law correlation function @xmath7 with @xmath8 , gamma function @xmath9 and generalized diffusion coefficient @xmath10 .",
    "note that we do not further specify the noise .",
    "following the pseudo - liouville hybrid approach of balescu  @xcite ( see  [ appendix : a ] ) one obtains the following exact result in eq .",
    "[ eq : f - solution ] for the pdf @xmath11 : @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this exact equation is non - local in time ( i.e.  non - markovian ) and non - local in space .",
    "we now make a local - in - space approximation by neglecting the term of the fluctuating displacement @xmath15 on the right hand side of the probability density @xmath16 .",
    "such an approximation seems to be reasonable in the long time and large space asymptotic limit if the drift and velocity fluctuations are weak enough .",

    "then it can be written as @xmath28 this equation was called a fractional wave equation in the seminal paper of schneider and wyss @xcite and has also been derived for a long - range correlated dichotomous stochastic process @xcite from a fractional klein - kramers equation @xcite and from a generalised chapman - kolmogorov equation @xcite .",
    "the solution of this equation has been studied in detail in @xcite where it was called a fractional kinetic equation for sub - ballistic superdiffusion .",
    "the equivalent form of this equation using the caputo fractional derivative was investigated in @xcite .",
    "our presentation above illustrates how a ffpe can be derived from a langevin equation with power - law decay in the velocity correlation function .",
    "it furthermore demonstrates that a fractional derivative provides the natural mathematical formulation to model equations containing power law memory kernels .",
    "in addition to type a ffpe eq .",
    "[ eq : ffpe - a ] we consider two further types of ffpes . both have been derived from ctrw theory @xcite .",
    "note that the underlying stochastic dynamics and the derivation of these two ffpes are very different from what we presented for type a above .",
    "indeed , both type b and type c are essentially ( almost ) markovian models , in contrast to type a. our two new ffpes describe subdiffusion under the influence of a constant external force and naturally appear in physical systems where diffusion is slowed down by deep traps @xcite .",
    "the difference between these two types arises from the position of the fractional rl derivative with respect to the diffusive and drift part of the equations and the range of the anomaly parameter @xmath29 .",

    "the representation in fourier - laplace space allows the calculation of moments by differentiation with respect to @xmath41 : @xmath42 after laplace inversion one obtains the first two moments and the central second moment for @xmath43 of type c ffpe defined in eq .",

    "[ eq : ffpe - c - ft - lt ] .",

    "in this work we studied three different types of ffpes generating anomalous diffusion : a superdiffusive one ( type a ) , a subdiffusive one ( type b ) , and another one that exhibits a transition from sub- to superdiffusion under parameter variation ( type c ) . type a and type b break fdr1 while type c preserves it .",
    "type a can be derived , under certain assumptions , from an overdamped langevin equation with power law correlations of the velocity fluctuations , types b and c have been derived before in the literature from ctrw theory .",
    "type c can also be obtained via subordination .",
    "we then calculated position pdfs for all models analytically and studied the shapes of all pdfs numerically under variation of the anomaly index as they evolve in time .",
    "finally we checked the work tfr for all three models .",
    "especially , we studied the time dependence of the ratio of the work fluctuations both for small and for large work by analytical asymptotic expansions in comparison to numerical evaluations .",
    "we find that our type c model with fdr1 exhibits a conventional work tfr for all times , meaning the fluctuation ratio is constant in time and linear in the work .",
    "for a correlated gaussian stochastic process it was shown that fdr1 implies the existence of a conventional tfr @xcite .",
    "our work generalises this result to an example of non - gaussian pdfs generated by ffpe dynamics .",
    "it is interesting that the conventional tfr is still obeyed , despite the highly non - trivial dynamics exhibited by both the position pdfs and the corresponding moments .",
    "the existence of the conventional tfr for this case is connected to the fact that only the equation for type c describes a subordinated process , namely the one subordinated to brownian motion with drift under random time transformation .",
    "an important open question is to which extent fig .",
    "[ fig : fdepdfs ] in @xcite summarising the interplay between fdr1 , fdr2 and tfrs for correlated gaussian stochastic processes in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions can be generalised to non - gaussian processes . for our other two models",
    "type a and type b the position pdfs show also very subtle and non - trivial non - gaussian shapes .",
    "however , in contrast to type c they are characterised by a highly non - trivial fluctuation ratio : for type a the latter decreases with time , for type b it increases .",
    "similar results have been obtained for the work tfr of strongly correlated gaussian stochastic processes without fdr1 @xcite . on top of this , for both types of ffpes the fluctuation ratio yields different long time limits depending on whether the work is small or large : for small work the fluctuation ratio converges to linearity in the work with constant prefactors , which reminds of the conventional tfr ; however , here the slopes depend on the anomaly index of the dynamics . for large work",
    "the fluctuation ratio remains nonlinear in the work , with convex and concave shapes for type a and type b , respectively .",
    "our work was motivated by experiments on cell migration @xcite , where data were successfully fitted by solutions of a fractional klein - kramers equation @xcite .",
    "several generalisations of such a klein - kramers equation have been proposed to describe processes under external fields @xcite , which in turn yield ffpes for the position only , similar to the ones studied in our paper , as special cases @xcite .",
    "we thus believe that our present work might have important applications to understand cell migration in nonequilibrium situations such as under chemical gradients ; see @xcite for first results .",
    "more generally , our theory might have applications to understand glassy nonequilibrium dynamics : in computer simulations of a number of glassy systems violations of conventional tfrs have been observed featuring fluctuation ratios that are nonlinear in the work with time - dependent prefactors @xcite .",
    "apart from such experimental applications , our first approach for deriving a ffpe pioneered by balescu @xcite deserves to be studied in more detail .",
    "for example , it would be interesting to derive a superdiffusive ffpe from it that preserves fdr1 , and to check again the tfr . on a broader scale",
    "it would be important to generalise our approach by considering more general observables , ideally dissipation functions @xcite or related functionals defined within stochastic thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "more general force fields than simply constant forces @xcite and other types of frs could be tested as well .",
