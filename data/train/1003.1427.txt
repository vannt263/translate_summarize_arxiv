    "the hadronization mechanism is an important but still unsolved problem up to now due to its nonperturbative nature .",
    "it is recognized that the hadronization mechanism is universal in all kinds of high energy reactions , _",
    "e.g_. , @xmath2 annihilation , and hadron(nuclear)-hadron(nuclear ) collisions . among these reactions , @xmath2 annihilation at high energies , especially at the @xmath0 factory in the future , is best for studying the hadronization mechanism , since all the final hadrons come from primary ones , all of which are hadronization results . the @xmath3 process is generally divided into four phases ( see fig .",
    "[ hdpro ] ) .    1 .   in the electro - weak phase , @xmath4 pair converts into a primary quark pair @xmath5 via virtual photon or @xmath6 .",
    "this phase is described by the electro - weak theory .",
    "2 .   the perturbative phase describes the radiation of gluons off the primary quarks , and the subsequent parton cascade due to gluon splitting into quarks and gluons , and the gluon radiation of secondary quarks .",
    "it is believed that perturbative qcd can describe this phase quantitatively .",
    "3 .   in the hadronization phase ,",
    "the quarks and gluons interact among themselves and excite the vacuum in order to dress themselves into hadrons , that is , the confinement is ` realized ' .",
    "since this process belongs to the unsolved nonperturbative qcd , investigations employing various models will shed light on understanding this process .",
    "4 .   in the fourth phase , unstable hadrons decay .",
    "this phase is usually described by using experimental data .",
    "this paper focuses on step 3 .",
    "the main method is to compare results of various hadronization models with the data , and the future @xmath0 factory is very suitable for this purpose .",
    "the popular hadronization models at the market , lund string fragmentation model(lsfm)@xcite , webber cluster fragmentation model(wcfm)@xcite , and quark combination model(qcm ) , succeed in explaining a lot of experimental data in @xmath7 and @xmath8 processes by adjusting corresponding parameters .",
    "recently , the baryon to meson ratio@xcite and constituent quark number scaling of elliptic flow @xmath9@xcite are measured at rhic experiments , which do not favor the fragmentation model , while the qcm can explain these phenomena naturally@xcite.qcm was first proposed by annisovich and bjorken _",
    "et al_. @xcite .",
    "it was famous for its simple picture and its successful prediction of the percentage of vector mesons .",
    "one of its great merits is that it treats the baryon and meson production in an uniform scheme , so it describes the baryon production naturally .",
    "however , for a long period qcm is regarded as being ruled out , because the prediction for baryon - antibaryon(@xmath1 ) rapidity correlation in @xmath2 annihilation by cerny s monte carlo program , which was alleged to be based on qcm , has great discrepancies with the experimental results of tasso collaboration@xcite . but early in 1987 , the @xmath1 phase space correlation from the naive qcm scheme was analyzed , which showed that there should not be such an inconsistency qualitatively . in the meantime",
    ", quark production rule and quark combination rule(the so - called ` shandong quark combination model(sdqcm ) ' ) were developed .",
    "then a serials of quantitative results obtained by sdqcm@xcite confirmed that sdqcm can naturally explain the @xmath1 short range rapidity correlation together with baryon to meson ratio when the multi - parton fragmentation is included . in order to understand the hadronization phenomena especially in heavy ion collisions ,",
    "it is necessary to study the hadronization mechanism in detail in @xmath2 annihilation once @xmath0 factory is available . on the other hand ,",
    "the hadronization model serves as a bridge between the perturbative qcd and experiments , so it is a very important tool for studying , _",
    "e.g. _ , lhc physics .",
    "the properties of the light hadrons have been studied in our previous works . here",
    "we focus on investigating the production of heavy hadrons(_e.g_. , @xmath10 , _",
    "etc_. ) by lsfm and sdqcm .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ ii ] , we give a brief introduction to the popular hadronization models , _",
    "i.e. _ , lund string fragmentation model , webber cluster fragmentation model and quark combination model .",
    "some numerical results are given in section [ iii ] .",
    "finally , a short summary and outlook close the study .",
    "string fragmentation model , first proposed by artru and mennesser in 1974@xcite , has been developed by the theory physics group of lund university since 1978 , and corresponding monte - carlo programs(_e.g_. , jetset , pythia , _",
    "etc_. ) are written . by",
    "now pythia is one of the most widely used generators describing the high - energy collisions .",
    "the hadronization of @xmath5 color - singlet is the simplest case for string fragmentation .",
    "lattice qcd supports a linear confinement potential between color charges,_i.e .",
    "_ , the energy stored in the color dipole field increases linearly with the separation between them .",
    "the assumption of linear confinement is the starting point for the string model . as the @xmath11 @xmath12 move away in the opposite direction , the kinetic energy of the system changes into the potential energy of the color string ( or color flux tube ) . when the potential increases to a certain extent the string will break by the production of a new quark pair , and the production possibility is given by the quantum mechanical tunnelling@xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the transverse mass of @xmath15 quark , and @xmath16 , the string constant , denotes the potential energy per unit length .",
    "considering the assumption of no transverse excitation of the string , the @xmath17 is locally compensated between @xmath18 and @xmath19 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tunneleffect ] ) , one sees clearly that the probability of the different flavors is about @xmath20 .",
    "so @xmath21 quarks are not expected to be produced through fragmentation , but only in the perturbative qcd procedure .    when the new quark pair @xmath22 are excited out in vacuum , the @xmath5 color string splits into @xmath23 and @xmath24 two color - singlets .",
    "if the invariant mass of either of the singlet system is large enough , further break will occur .",
    "the process ends when all string pieces become exactly hadrons on their mass - shells .",
    "this picture describes meson production naturally other than the production of baryons .",
    "more complex diquark and popcorn mechanisms have to be introduced to explain the baryon production .",
    "one prominent feature of lsfm is that energy momentum and flavour are conserved at each step of the fragmentation process .    in @xmath7 process at high energies ,",
    "multi - parton states will be produced at the end of perturbative phase , so that the multi - parton fragmentation has to be taken into account .",
    "the corresponding procedures have been developed in ref .",
    "the fragmentation picture of lund model is shown in fig .",
    "[ figld ] .",
    "the cluster fragmentation model has been proposed by wolfram@xcite in 1980 .",
    "webber cluster fragmentation model(wcfm)@xcite is the well - known example .",
    "it has three parts :    * the formation of color - singlet cluster .",
    "gluons split into quark pairs after parton shower : @xmath25 .",
    "adjacent quark and anti - quark from different gluons combine to form a color - singlet .",
    "* cluster with large invariant mass fragments into smaller ones . *",
    "little cluster decays into primary hadrons._i.e .",
    "_ , @xmath26 .",
    "note that only two - body decay or fragmentation is adopted in the webber cluster fragmentation model .",
    "the corresponding hadronization picture is local , universal and simple .",
    "its fragmentation picture is shown in fig .",
    "[ figwebber ] .      in the framework of sdqcm , quark production rule(qpr ) , quark combination rule ( qcr )",
    "are adopted to describe the hadronization in a color singlet system , and then a simple longitudinal phase space approximation  ( lpsa ) is used to obtain the momentum distribution for primary hadrons in its own system .",
    "finally this hadronization scheme is extended to the multi - parton states .",
    "here we briefly introduce the sdqcm and list the relevant equations(for detail , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .      in a color singlet system formed by @xmath5 , @xmath27 pairs of quarks can be produced by vacuum excitation via strong interaction .",
    "we assume that @xmath27 satisfies poisson distribution : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the average number of those quark pairs . according to qpr",
    ", @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the invariant mass of the system , @xmath32 is a free parameter , @xmath33 is the average mass of newborn quarks , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the masses of endpoint quark and anti - quark .",
    "thus we have @xmath27 pairs of quarks according to eqs .",
    "( [ fir ] ) ,  ( [ fir1 ] ) ( containing one primary quark pair ) .",
    "when describing how quarks and antiquarks form hadrons , we find that all kinds of hadronization models satisfy the near correlation in rapidity more or less .",
    "since there is no deep understanding of the significance and the role of this , the near rapidity correlation has not been used sufficiently . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have shown that the nearest correlation in rapidity is in agreement with the fundamental requirements of qcd , and determines qcr completely .",
    "the rule guarantees that the combination of quarks across more than two rapidity gaps never emerges and that @xmath27 quarks and @xmath27 antiquarks are exactly exhausted , which guarantees the unitarity ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . given that the quarks and antiquarks are stochastically arranged in rapidity space , each order can occur with the same probability .",
    "then the probability distribution for @xmath27 quarks and @xmath27 antiquarks to combine into @xmath36 mesons , @xmath37 baryons and @xmath37 anti - baryons according to qcr is given by @xmath38 the average numbers of primary mesons @xmath39 and baryons @xmath40 are @xmath41 approximately , in the combination for @xmath42 , @xmath39 and baryons @xmath40 can be well parameterized as linear functions of quark number @xmath27 , @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 . but for @xmath46 , one has @xmath47 so that , the production ratio of baryon to meson is obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ w2 ] ) and ( [ w3 ] ) @xmath48 we see that sdqcm treats meson and baryon formation uniformly , and there is no extra @xmath49 mechanism and free parameters for the baryon production . here",
    "the @xmath50 ratio is completely determined at a certain @xmath27 , unlike in lsfm it is completely uncertain and has to be adjusted by free parameters , i.e , the ratio of diquark to quark @xmath51 .      in order to give the momentum distribution of primary hadrons , each phenomenological model must have some inputs .",
    "for example , in lsfm , they use a symmetric longitudinal fragmentation function @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are two free parameters ( and @xmath53 is flavor dependent ) . in this paper , in order to give the momentum distribution of primary hadrons produced according to qpr and qcr , we simply adopt the widely used lpsa which is equivalent to the constant distribution of rapidity .",
    "hence a primary hadron @xmath55 is uniformly distributed in the rapidity axis , and then its rapidity can be written as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a random number ; @xmath58 and @xmath59 are two arguments , and can be determined by energy - momentum conservation in such a color singlet system @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 denote the energy and the longitudinal momentum of the @xmath55th primary hadron respectively , obtained by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the mass of the @xmath55th primary hadron , and @xmath67 obeys the distribution @xmath68 in this paper , we set @xmath69 .",
    "( [ last ] ) is just what lsfm uses .",
    "note that lpsa or the constant rapidity distribution is rather naive , but it is convenient for us to study the correlations without introducing many complicating parameters .      at the end of parton showering ,",
    "a final multi - parton state will start to hadronize . to connect the final multi - parton state with sdqcm",
    ", we adopt a simple treatment assumed in wcfm , _",
    "i.e. _ before hadronization , each gluon at last splits into a @xmath70 pair , the @xmath18 and @xmath71 carry one half of the gluon momentum , and each of them forms a color singlet with their counterpart antiquark and quark in their neighbourhood , respectively .",
    "now take the three parton state @xmath72 as an example to illustrate the hadronization of a multi - parton state .",
    "denote the 4-momenta for @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath73 as @xmath74 before hadronization , the gluon splits into a @xmath70 pair and the @xmath18 and @xmath71 carry one half of the gluon momentum , and the @xmath72 system forms two color singlet subsystems @xmath75 and @xmath24 .",
    "the invariant masses of the subsystems are @xmath76 as was commonly argued by sjstrand and khoze recently@xcite , the confinement effects should lead to a subdivision of the full @xmath5 system into color singlet subsystems with screened interactions between these subsystems @xmath75 and @xmath24 .",
    "hence sdqcm can be applied independently to each color singlet subsystem,_i.e .",
    "_ , we can apply the equations in the former two subsections to each subsystem , and obtain the momentum distribution for the primary hadrons in their own center - of - mass system .",
    "then after lorentz transformation , the momentum distribution of the primary hadrons in laboratory frame is given .",
    "this treatment can be extended to a general multi - parton state , for example , see fig .",
    "[ qcm1a ] .    obviously , when the emitting gluon is soft or collinear with the direction of @xmath11 or @xmath12 , @xmath72 can not be distinguished from @xmath5 and @xmath77 or @xmath78 is too small for hadronization . for the avoidance of these situations ,",
    "a cut - off mass @xmath79 has to be introduced . here",
    "@xmath79 is a free parameter in the perturbative phase .",
    "its value and energy dependence is theoretically uncertain .",
    "the physical assumption is that @xmath79 is independent of energy@xcite .",
    "in this paper , we study the hadronization process at @xmath0 factory by lsfm and sdqcm .",
    "we focus on investigating the properties of the heavy hadrons , _",
    "e.g_. , the ratio of baryon to meson and the baryon - antibaryon correlations . for lsfm",
    ", we use the default parameter values in pythia , while for sdqcm , we adopt the parameters used in ref .",
    "@xcite which fit data quite well .",
    "the final hadron multiplicity at high energy @xmath2 reactions is always an important topic .",
    "we list the predictions of final hadron multiplicities at @xmath0 factory(@xmath80 ) by lsfm and sdqcm in table i. the results of lsfm are obtained by running pythia6.4 with the default parameters .",
    "the experimental data are from ref .",
    "it is found that the predictions of lsfm and those of sdqcm are consistent with most of the experimental data . however , the multiplicity of the heavy baryons , _",
    "eg_. , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , are still not measured at @xmath0 energy , and the corresponding theoretical predictions obtained by lsfm and sdqcm are quite different . therefore it is important to measure their production rates at @xmath0 pole in order to discriminate different hadronization mechanisms . at the @xmath0 energy",
    ", we study the relation between the integrated luminosity and the producing number of the heavy baryons .",
    "the corresponding results are displayed in fig.[lumz0 ] .",
    "it is obvious that for the lep i , the production number for @xmath81 predicted by lsfm(sdqcm ) is about @xmath83 , and that for @xmath84 is several tens(hundreds ) . in order to study the heavy baryon production mechanism with enough precision",
    ", the integrated luminosity should be increased as large as possible .",
    "for example , if the integrated luminosity of @xmath0 factory can reach about @xmath85 , the produced number of @xmath84 may reach several thousands(ten thousands ) according to the prediction of lsfm(sdqcm ) , which makes it possible to study the properties of the heavy baryons and to test the hadronization models with higher precision .",

    ", such studies help to investigate the multi - production processes in other high energy reactions(_e.g .",
    "_ , at rhic energy ) . in this paper , we report the predictions especially related to heavy hadrons , for example , baryon to meson ratio and @xmath1 flavor correlations obtained by lsfm and sdqcm in the hadronic @xmath0 decay .",
    "these results show that the future experiments at @xmath0 factory to test hadronization mechanism , especially rare hadronized events , such as the doubly heavy baryon production , are significant .",
    "though many studies have been made for the @xmath7 process , still a lot of unclear but important topics are worth studying , such as the color connection effects@xcite .",
    "the color connection among final partons plays a crucial role in the surface between pqcd phase and the hadronization one(see fig .",
    "[ hdpro ] ) .",
    "different choices of the color connections of the final multi - parton system leads to different hadronization results .",

    "fortunately , in the future @xmath0 factory , a large number of events such as @xmath92 will be produced@xcite , so that the correlated physical observables can be measured with higher statistics .",
