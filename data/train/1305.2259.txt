    "the microcanonical ensemble has always played an important role in the foundation of equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite . for practical applications and computational purposes though the canonical and the grandcanonical ensembles have traditionally been considered more relevant because frequently the considered systems are in contact with their environments acting as heat and particle reservoirs .",
    "often , the choice of the ensemble is merely a matter of convenience because for the large class of systems with short range interactions all ensembles become equivalent provided the number of constituting particles is sufficiently large .    for systems with long range interactions @xcite and for small systems with few particles the different ensembles are no longer equivalent and hence the correct ensemble",
    "must be chosen depending on the physical situation @xcite ,  with gravity being a prominent example @xcite .",
    "the enormous recent progress in manipulating cold atoms @xcite , which often are isolated from their environment to a very high degree , has given renewed interest and practical relevance to the microcanonical ensemble .    in experiments ,",
    "such systems are tested by the change of control parameters such as the strengths and positioning of laser - fields which generate the effective potentials in which the atoms are trapped @xcite .",
    "the work performed on the system turns out to be a random quantity with a distribution depending both on the protocol and the chosen initial state @xcite . in the case of a microcanonical system",
    "the work distribution depends on the initial energy .",
    "the general form of the microcanonical work distribution was first derived for classical systems in @xcite and later for quantum systems in @xcite where a formal representation of a microcanonical state was used in terms of a dirac delta - function . in order to obtain a properly defined density matrix , i.e.",
    ", a positive operator with unit trace @xcite , the delta function defining it must be regularized .",
    "this regularization can be done in many different ways and therefore introduces some arbitrariness .",
    "it can physically be understood as the attempt to account for experimental or theoretical uncertainties of the energy .    in the present work",
    "we take a different approach and write the density matrix of a microcanonical state as the properly normalized projection operator onto all states with a given energy as discussed in section ii .",
    "based on this form of the density matrix we derive the probability density function of work and various equivalent forms of the microcanonical fluctuation theorems in section iii .",
    "these fluctuation theorems are a consequence of a detailed balance - like relation for the transition probabilities between energy eigenstates of the hamiltonians at the end and the beginning of the protocol , a relation that is also crucial for canonical @xcite and grandcanonical fluctuation theorems @xcite .",
    "we illustrate the obtained results with the example of a two - dimensional harmonic oscillator whose potential energy is suddenly squeezed or widened along its principal axes .",
    "work statistics for a one - dimensional oscillator under the action of time - dependent but otherwise constant forces was analyzed for different initial conditions including pure energy eigenstates in @xcite .",
    "the squeezing of a one - dimensional oscillator out of canonical states was studied in @xcite .",
    "here we consider rational principal frequency ratios before and after the deformation giving rise to degeneracies of the energy eigenvalues and compare the quantum work distributions to the corresponding classical expressions which are typically approached for large initial energies .",
    "the paper closes with concluding remarks . in the appendix ,",
    "the work distributions for deformations of classical one- and two - dimensional oscillators are presented .",
    "in order to prevent a finite system to eventually escape to infinity , it has to be confined in space by a sufficiently steeply increasing potential . as a consequence , the hamiltonian of such a system has a pure point - spectrum .",
    "accumulation points and continuous parts of the spectrum do not occur .",
    "there are various ways to represent the density matrix of a system in the microcanonical state .",
    "one , formal representation is most close to the classical form of a microcanonical probability density function ( pdf ) in terms of a dirac - delta function concentrated on the respective energy shell .",
    "it is given by _",
    "e = _e^-1 ( h - e ) , where @xmath0 is the hamiltonian of the considered system and _e = ( h - e ) denotes the density of states . in order that the density matrix as well as the density of states are well defined for all values of the continuous energy variable @xmath1 the delta - function @xmath2 must be replaced by a continuous function which is mainly localized at @xmath3 , such as a narrow gaussian @xmath4 , _ ( x ) = 1/ e^-x^2/(2 ^2 ) .",
    "the width @xmath5 has to be chosen small enough .",
    "it may be thought of representing the actual resolution of the energy as being determined by experiment or , within a theoretical model .    with the spectral representation of the hamiltonian , h = _",
    "n e_n p_n , expressed in terms of the eigenenergies @xmath6 and the eigenprojectors @xmath7 the density matrix becomes a sum over the energy levels @xmath8 , i.e. _ e = _e^-1 ( e_n - e ) p_n .",
    "the density of states then is a weighted sum of delta - functions _e = _",
    "n d_n ( e_n - e ) , where @xmath9 denotes the degeneracy of the @xmath8th eigenvalue , expressible as the trace of the respective projector , @xmath10 .",
    "alternatively , the microcanonical density matrix can be written in terms of an eigenprojector _",
    "n = d_n^-1 p_n , which is a function of the discrete index @xmath8 rather than the continuous energy @xmath1 .",
    "the dunford integral @xcite allows one to define an operator @xmath11 that coincides with @xmath7 for @xmath12 and is zero otherwise .",
    "it is defined in terms of an operator - valued cauchy - integral reading p(e ) = _ _ ( e ) , where @xmath13 is a circular path with radius @xmath5 encircling @xmath1 counterclockwise .",
    "the microcanonical density matrix as a function of @xmath1 can then be represented as ( e ) = _ e p(e ) , where _ e = _",
    "n d^-1_n ( e_n - e ) , and ( x ) = \\ {    ll 1 & x=0 + 0 &    .. in terms of the latter function , the projection operator @xmath11 can also be expressed as p(e ) = _ n ( e - e_n ) p_n .",
    "this result follows from ( [ pds ] ) by means of the spectral resolution of the hamiltonian @xmath0 , ( [ h ] ) , and of the identity @xmath14 .",
    "note that , strictly speaking , the density matrices for the microcanonical state as given by the regularized delta - function representation @xmath15 , see ( [ rd],[de ] ) , are different from @xmath16 defined by ( [ re ] ) .",
    "while @xmath16 is strictly zero for energies not agreeing with an eigenvalue @xmath6 , @xmath15 assigns a properly normalized density matrix to any value of the energy . for values different from an energy eigenvalue ,",
    "the assigned states are fictitious .",
    "taking the idea of a microcanonical ensemble in a wider sense , namely that of a collection of nearly identical systems with almost identical energy spectra within the small energy width @xmath17 , the use of @xmath15 as a microcanonical density operator becomes , however , physically sensible again .",
    "in order to perform work on a system , parameters @xmath18 of the system s hamiltonian are changed according to a prescribed protocol @xmath19 starting at @xmath20 and ending at time @xmath21 .",
    "the ensuing dynamics is governed by the schrdinger equation @xmath22 for the unitary time evolution operator @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes the hamiltonian with the parameter @xmath25 at the time @xmath26 according to the protocol .",

    "can always be reversed by formally letting time @xmath26 run backwards . if the parameters @xmath25 have a parity @xmath30 and if the time reversal operator @xmath31 transforms the hamiltonian @xmath24 at each time according to h((t))^-1 = h(_(t ) ) then the inverse of the map corresponds to a dynamics in physical time under the action of the time - reversed protocol @xmath32 @xcite , i.e. u^-1 ( ) = u^ ( ) = u(| ) ^-1 . for the sake of simplicity , so far , we have neglected a possible dependence of the hamiltonian on parameters that are odd under time - reversal but unchanged during the protocol , as for example a constant magnetic field .",
    "such fields couple to system operators that are odd under time reversal and consequently also must be reversed in the time - reversed map @xmath33 .    in order to determine the work applied to the system in each individual run of the protocol , energy measurements at the beginning and the end of the protocol have to be performed .",
    "we assume here that the time - dependent hamiltonian is gauged in such a way that it represents the instantaneous energy of the system at any instant of time @xcite .",
    "assuming an initially uniform distribution of states with the same energy @xmath34 the protocol @xmath27 causes a transition to a state with final energy @xmath35 with the probability @xmath36 given by p_(m|n ) = d^-1_n(t_0)p_m(t_f ) u ( ) p_n(t_0 ) u^ ( ) , where any @xmath37 projects on the instantaneous eigenspace of the hamiltonian @xmath24 corresponding to the instantaneous eigenenergy @xmath38 , i.e. , h((t ) ) p_n(t ) = e_n(t ) p_n(t ) .",

    "since the work performed on the system during the protocol is determined as the difference of the final and initial energies , @xmath47 , the pdf of work , @xmath48 , conditioned on the discrete energy @xmath34 is given by p_(w|n ) = _ m ( w - e_m(t_f)-e_n(t_0 ) ) p_(m|n ) . with ( [ db ] )",

    "the first delta - function under the integral on the right hand side of ( [ pcla ] ) collects those initial phase space points which give the work @xmath157 and the second delta - function specifies the microcanonical state at energy @xmath1 . carrying out the momentum integration and introducing the dimensionless coordinates @xmath158 one obtains for the classical work pdf the scaling relation p^_(w|e ) = ( w / e)/e , where the scaling function @xmath117 becomes ( z ) = i_g d^2 ( z - _ 1 x_1 ^ 2 -_2 x^2_2 ) .",
    "the integration is extended over the unit disk @xmath159 .",
    "the dimensionless parameters @xmath160 are measures of the potential deformation .",
    "the support of the scaling function is determined by those values of the scaled work variable @xmath161 for which a part of the conic section @xmath162 lies within the unit disk @xmath163 .",
    "depending on the signs of @xmath118 and @xmath119 one finds the following explicit results for the scaling function @xmath117 : ( z ) = \\ {      .",
    "the upper form of @xmath117 applies if the oscillator undergoes a compression or an expansion in both principal directions provided @xmath164 ; the opposite case , @xmath165 , follows by exchanging @xmath118 and @xmath119 with each other .",
    "the second form applies for an expansion in the 1-direction and a compression in the 2-direction . in the remaining limiting cases one obtains ( z)= ( ) ( 1- ) \\ {      .",
    "finally , the classical work pdf of a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator with a microcanonical initial state scales as p^_(w , e ) = ^(w/(e ) ) / ( e ) , where ^(z ) = , with the deformation measure @xmath166 .",
    "note that this pdf has square - root singularities at @xmath134 and @xmath167 whereas the two - dimensional case leads only to the singularity at @xmath134 .",
