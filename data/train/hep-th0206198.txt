    "from the 5d metric ( [ 5metr ] ) we see that on a given @xmath48 constant 4d hypersurface the proper time can be defined as @xmath49 .",
    "so the hubble and deceleration parameters can be defined as @xmath50 where we have used the relation @xmath51 . meanwhile , the first equation in ( [ bran5sol ] ) for the branes can be written as @xmath52 ^{2}+k\\;,\\quad i=1,2\\;.   \\label{a^2i}\\ ] ] then , using ( [ rho1 ] ) , ( [ rho2 ] ) and ( [ h , q ] ) in ( [ a^2i ] ) , we obtain @xmath53 @xmath54 these two equations are the induced friedmann equations on the branes .    thus we obtain a complete set of global exact solutions given in ( [ bran5sol ] ) and ( [ rho1])-([hi - pi ] ) which contains two arbitrary functions @xmath55 and @xmath56 . from the relation @xmath57 and metric ( [ 5metr ] )",
    "we see that the form of @xmath58 is invariant under an arbitrary coordinate transformation @xmath59 .. this freedom can be used to fix one of the two functions @xmath55 and @xmath60 .",
    "another freedom corresponds , as is in the standard general relativity , to the unspecified equation of state of matter . for a given equation of state @xmath61 ,",
    "the two equations in ( [ rho1 ] ) give a constraint that can be used to determine the function , say , @xmath56 .",
    "so , generally speaking , if the matter content on the first brane is known , then @xmath62 and @xmath56 can be fixed .",
    "then the whole solutions can be fixed too .",
    "then , by ( [ rho2 ] ) , if the size @xmath63 of the fifth dimension is also known , we will know the matter content on the second brane , and this is of great importance .",
    "using above procedure , we can , in principle , construct particular models such as the matter and radiation dominated models as in the standard frw cosmology .",
    "however , preliminary studies show that they are not mathematically simple .",
    "so we leave this study in the future . here , in this letter , we will use another way to obtain an explicit universe model , that is , we will choose @xmath55 and @xmath56 firstly  and then to study the evolution and matter properties .",
    "now we let @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a constant with a dimension of length and @xmath66 ( we assume @xmath67 ) is a critical constant with a dimension of time . in this way the solutions ( [ bran5sol ] ) become @xmath68 \\ ; ,   \\notag \\\\",

    "we see that , in a @xmath48 constant hypersurface , the scale factors @xmath71 and @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "so it approaches the standard radiation - dominated model at late times of the universe .",
    "the global evolution of the scale factor @xmath74 with @xmath75 and @xmath76 is plotted in fig.1 . from this figure",
    "we see that there is a singular surface @xmath77 in which @xmath78 as @xmath79 , showing a * big bang * singularity as is in the standard frw models .",
    "however , in all other hypersurfaces , the scale factor @xmath30 reaches a * non - zero minimum * @xmath80 at @xmath81 ( where @xmath82 ) ; and at both sides of this minimum , @xmath30 tends to infinity .",
    "so this minimum can naturally be explained as a * big bounce * [ 7 ] .",
    "generally , the solution has two kinds of singularities , corresponding to @xmath83 and @xmath82 respectively as discussed in ref .",
    "@xmath83 is , by ( [ rr ] ) , an intrinsic singularity of the 5d manifold , whereas @xmath82 is just a coordinate singularity similar to the schwarzschild event horizon .",
    "so here the big bounce singularity belongs to the second kind .    .",
    "the first brane ( our universe ) is at @xmath84 ; while the second brane ( the hidden universe ) could be placed at @xmath85 , @xmath86 , or @xmath87 , giving three types of brane cosmological models , respectively.,width=254,height=254 ]    the first brane is at @xmath84 . by ( [ bran1spec ] )",
    "we see that at the bounce point @xmath88 we have @xmath89 tends to its minimum , @xmath90 tends to zero , @xmath91 is finite , and @xmath92 tends to infinity .",
    "physically , we can say that it is this infinitely large pressure @xmath92 that caused the big bounce .    from ( [ bran2spec ] )",
    "we see that the evolution and the matter properties on the second brane depend on the size @xmath63 of the fifth dimension ( see fig . 1 also ) .",
    "thus we have three types of brane models as shown below .",
    "* type i*. the second brane is at @xmath93 .",
    "then ( [ bran2spec ] ) gives @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and@xmath96 .",
    "this implies that the second brane is empty of matter .",
    "so type i is actually a * one - brane model * for which there was a big bounce on our side of the model and a big bang on the `` hidden '' side .    *",
    "type ii*. the second brane is at @xmath97 .",
    "then ( [ bran2spec ] ) shows that there were bounces on both branes . on the second brane we have @xmath98 .",
    "so type ii is a * two - brane model * for which the energy density on the second brane is * negative*.    * type iii*. the second brane is at @xmath99 .",
    "this is also a * two - brane model * for which the energy density on the second brane is * positive*. specifically , if @xmath100 , then @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 , giving a completely symmetric two - brane model .",
    "now let us consider the solution ( [ bran1spec ] ) for which when the coordinate time @xmath12 varies from @xmath8 to @xmath66 and then to @xmath105 , the spatial scale factor @xmath106 contracts from @xmath105 to a minimum @xmath107 and then expands to @xmath105 again .",
    "we also find that as @xmath79 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and the 4d metric on the first brane tends to @xmath110 by a coordinate transformation @xmath111 we get @xmath112 which represents a _",
    "deflationary _ de sitter cosmological model . note that by ( [ t - trans ] ) @xmath113 corresponds to @xmath114 .",
    "therefore we conclude that according to the proper time @xmath115 , the universe on the first brane has been existed forever and contracts from a de sitter space to a non - zero minimum , at which the pressure @xmath92 reaches to infinity and causes a big bounce .",
    "after then , the universe expands .    in conclusion , we have derived a class of exact global solutions of five - dimensional cosmological models with two 3-branes , for which matter on the branes is of the form of a perfect fluid , the bulk is empty , and no cosmological constants were introduced .",
    "this solutions contain two arbitrary constants @xmath6 and @xmath15 , corresponding to the 3d and 5d curvatures respectively , and two arbitrary functions @xmath55 and @xmath56 , corresponding to the two freedoms : the arbitrary coordinate transformation @xmath116  and the unspecified equation of state of matter . by choosing @xmath55 and @xmath56",
    "properly a special model is discussed in detail .",
    "it is found that in the late times of the universe this model evolves at the same rate as is in the standard radiation - dominated frw model .",
    "and there is a singular 4d hypersurface @xmath84 on which there was a big bang . on all other hypersurfaces",
    "there were no big bang but big bounces . before the bounces , the universe was in a contracting phase .",
    "it is also found that whether the energy density on the second brane is positive , zero , or negative depend on the size of the fifth dimension .",
    "thus three types of models are obtained for which type i is actually a one - brane model while types ii and iii are two - brane models with negative and positive energy densities , respectively .        9 n. arkani - hamed , s. dimopoulos and g. dvali , phys . lett .",
