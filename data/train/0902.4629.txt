    "arp & madore ( 1987 , hereafter am87 ) undertook a fairly comprehensive survey of the southern sky in search of peculiar and interacting galaxies visible on the iiia - j photographic survey plates as part of the uk schmidt sky survey .",
    "they inspected some 100,000 galaxies and culled out about 7,000 objects that were noteworthy enough to be cataloged , and in a number of cases , individually illustrated . based on",
    "this statistically robust sample am87 went beyond simple cataloging and added a broad list of descriptors covering about two dozen properties .",
    "one of these descriptor / classifications was category 6 : ring galaxy .",
    "as already noted by am87 `` ring galaxy '' , in the isolated context of this particular catalog , was a purely morphologically defined descriptor ; as a consequence this descriptor encompasses several physically distinct types of galaxies .",
    "first , there are relatively normal galaxies with `` outer rings '' . in the rc3 system of de vaulcouleurs et al .",
    "these are typed as * rs * galaxies , and called `` outer ringed '' galaxies in the compilation by buta ( 1995 ) .",
    "outer rings are not uncommon and are generally well understood ( see buta for an overview ) .",
    "second , there are `` polar ring galaxies '' ; systems thought to be advanced mergers with the disrupted satellite now orbiting the parent galaxy over the pole and forming the ring - like structure .",
    "these are exceedingly rare objects ( see whitmore et al .",
    "1990 for a recent compilation and references therein . ) finally , there are the collisional systems ( called `` ring '' in rc3 ) ; and they are the focus of this paper .    in an earlier paper ( which was based on an incomplete , early - release version of the arp - madore catalogue )",
    "few , madore & arp ( 1986 ) ( hereafter fma ) pointed out the two dominant types of rings in the catalog and separated them into two distinct classes : * o - types * for the outer ( `` resonant '' ) rings , and * p - types * for the classical ( `` collisional '' ) rings .",
    "the main conclusion of that paper was that the * p - type * ( ring ) galaxies were consistent with the head - on collision scenario , being championed in that same time period by theys & spiegel ( 1976 ) and independently by lynds & toomre ( 1976 ) .",
    "the full success of that theory has broader implications which are explored in madore et al .",
    "all three of the current authors independently inspected and reclassified each of the 500 + category  6 ( ring galaxies ) in am87 . only * p - type",
    "* galaxies ( on the fma classification system ) were retained for this study .",
    "that is , any object with a crisp , relatively high - surface - brightness ring , with the nucleus often asymmetrically placed ( or in some cases absent ) , was given the p classification and retained .",
    "objects with more diffuse or feathery outer rings ( of generally somewhat lower surface brightness ) , with fairly large nuclear regions or bulges symmetrically placed with respect to the ring , were deemed to be the * o types*. these objects were returned to the general pool . out of 552 class  6 ( ring ) objects in am87 we culled out 104 * p - type * ring galaxies ; and for only a handful of objects was there any disagreement among the authors as to their classification .",
    "erring on the conservative / inclusive side , all of the contentious objects were retained in this study .",
    "table 1 lists all 104 pure * p - type * ( ring ) galaxies found in am87 .",
    "we note here that pure ring galaxies constitute less than 2% of the am87 peculiar galaxy population , and as such they are found in the general population of galaxies only 0.01% of the time ( as normalized by the entire population of @xmath0100,000 galaxies inspected by am87 in the course of constructing the catalog as a whole . )",
    "ring galaxies are a rare type of collision with short - lived evidence .",
    "it is of course interesting to contemplate what ring galaxies look like after the collisionally - induced burst of star formation fades .",
    "we leave that as an exercise for the future .    rather than simply illustrating a few of the most spectacular examples of ring galaxies , as was done in am87 , we have chosen to re - catalog and present the entire sample .",
    "however , before doing that we decided to additionally survey the literature for previously cataloged ring galaxies and add them to the _ atlas _ for completeness sake . the am87 sample is given in table 1 , while the ring galaxies from the literature are collected in table 2 .",
    "clearly the northern and equatorial sky is incompletely sampled .",
    "we estimate that about 200 more ring galaxies await discovery once those regions are inspected to the same apparent - size and surface - brightness limit as am87 .",
    "table 1 and 2 share the same basic formating .",
    "column 1 contains the name of the host ring galaxy complex ; the second column contains the name or names of the ring nucleus followed by as many companions as are suspected of being colliders .",
    "the name of the ring nucleus is composed of the name of the host object followed by rn ( e.g. , am  0147 - 350:rn ) ; by way of contrast , companion / colliders are identified by the host object name followed by c1 , c2 , etc .",
    "( e.g. , am  0147 - 350:c1 , am  0147 - 350:c2 , am  0147 - 350:c3 ) .",
    "columns 4 and 5 respectively contain ra(2000 ) and dec(2000 ) positions , each measured to a precision of 5  arcsec . in column 5",
    "the first entry ( d = diameter ) , corresponds to the diameter of the ring , measured in arcsec , while the following entries in that same column but now for the companions are marked by s , and give the separation of the companion from the nucleus of the ring ( again , measured in arcsec ) .",
    "finally , column 6 gives the heliocentric velocity for the object / component when available from the literature as captured by ned in its december 2008 release .",
    "all of the objects in this new listing consist of at least two objects in the immediate field of view that can reasonably be identified with the collider and the ( collidee ) ring .",
    "we mark those objects in each of the illustrations and for uniformity sake we have measured the positions of all objects given in tables 1 and 2 using the display capabilities of aladin interacting with the ned image archive .",
    "the presence of nearby companions was by no means a foregone conclusion given that the rings were chosen purely on the basis of their morphology , not on the basis of their nearby or distant environment .",
    "we consider it highly likely that these optical companions are the colliders , plausibly responsible for the `` gravitational splash '' and the ensuing ring - like , star - formation response predicted / post - dicted by the simulations . indeed , of the 64 companions with published redshifts ( found from a search of the january 2008 release of the ned database ) 60 have redshifts that place them at the same distance as the ring itself .",
    "in all four of the other instances where one of the apparent companions proved to be a background object there was always an additional candidate collider in the same field of view .",
    "although common radial velocities are not conclusive proof that any given object is the collider it does clearly demonstrate that the vast majority of those objects are not chance line - of - sight background ( or foreground ) objects .",
    "111 apparent companions still need redshifts ; 43 of the rings themselves are without published velocities .",
    "we are working to ameliorate that situation .    while all of our ring galaxies have one or more apparent companions , as a class ring galaxies tend not to be found in high - density ( cluster ) environments .",
    "indeed , only 7 of the 132 rings cataloged here have more than three companions in their immediate vicinity .",
    "they are am  0401 - 641 , am  0417 - 391 , am  0455 - 465 , am  1003 - 215 , am  1251 - 283 , am  2100 - 725 and am  2200 - 715 .",
    "83 of the rings have only one nearby optical companion , 29 have two companions , and only 13 have three .",
    "it seems reasonable to suppose that in dense systems the more frequent , but off - center encounters with other group members will disrupt and/or destroy any ring that might form from a direct hit more quickly than in the quiescent field .",
    "perhaps the increased velocity dispersion of all the members associated with the cluster environment also plays a role .",
    "and it should not be forgotten that very rich clusters are _ currently _ depleted of disk galaxies in any case : with no disks to be hit , no rings can be formed . however , at high redshift the situation is expected to be quite different . a search for rings in various `` deep fields '' ( udf , goods and gems ) has been made ( elmegreen & elmegreen 2006 ) . according to those authors and judging from the published images of their pure `` rings '' ( their figure 1 ) these are almost exclusively * o - type * ( outer - ring ) galaxies with well - centered bulges and no obvious companions .",
    "some collisional objects may be found in their sample of fifteen `` partial rings '' ; however , the area shown around each partial ring is too small to judge whether these objects have interacting companions or not .",
    "figure 1 shows the wide range of absolute ( k - band ) magnitudes that the ring galaxies in this catalog have .",
    "spanning more than a factor of 100 in luminosity galaxies with ring - like morphology can be as faint as m@xmath1 = -19  mag and as bright as m@xmath1 = -25  mag ; typical ring galaxies have m@xmath1 = -23  mag which is somewhat fainter than the knee in the general - field luminosity function . the colliders are typically half a magnitude fainter than the central ( target ) galaxy ( figure 2 ) , but their dispersion is large ( @xmath20.75  mag ) .",
    "the current diameters of the rings cataloged here span a wide range being broadly peaked at 30 - 40  kpc , but extending up to values as large as 70  kpc ( figure 3 ) .",
    "none of these plots argue for separate populations of ring galaxies based solely on these physical properies .",
    "some ring galaxies ( e.g. , am 0058 - 220 , am 1953 - 260 , arp  147 & vii  zw  466 ) do not have any obvious component that can unambiguously be identified as a nucleus .",
    "the morphology of such objects has been aptly likened to `` smoke rings . ''",
    "the apparent lack of a nucleus may be because the target galaxy simply never had a particularly noteworthy nucleus to begin with ( i.e. , even before the collision ) or it may be that the timing of the interaction , combined with our particular viewing angle places the nucleus in the ring ( see ngc  4774 , arp  146 ) and/or even confused with the intruder . in other instances the nucleus may have been disrupted by the collision .",
    "detailed modeling would illuminate these possibilities .",
    "we draw attention to a sub - class of objects in this compilation of ring galaxies : double rings . am  2136 - 492 is noteworthy .",
    "the cartwheel ( am  0035 - 335 ) is another example ( with its celebrated compact nuclear ring ) ; while am  0339 - 625 , am  1323 - 222 and am  1354 - 250 may be other less obvious examples of this class .",
    "figure 6 shows a deeply stretched image of am  0339 - 625 illustrating its fragmented , outer ring - like feature .",
    "although multiple rings structures seem to be a common feature in the numerical simulations ( e.g. antunes & wallin 2007 ) they appears not to be not so common in nature .",
    "a simple calculation concerning the apparent frequency of ring galaxies leads to a rather surprising / interesting result .",
    "the relative frequency of the collisonal ring phenomenon is at least 1 in 1000 , given that am87 inspected approximately 100,000 galaxies and out of those cataloged only 100 rings .",
    "( and this is a lower limit given that edge - on rings are probably under - represented in the catalog . ) if the ring structure can unambiguously be detected as such for one dynamical timescale ( @xmath3 yrs , say ) and if the collision rate is constant over cosmic time , then about one in every ten galaxies in this same volume is expected to have been perturbed in this same way over a hubble time .",
    "given the restricted parameter space available for a head - on collision to occur this strongly suggests that , if the orbits of these types of companions are isotropic ( and only a small fraction of them produce rings ) then the majority of galaxies in the local volume have presumably been hit ( with a different impact parameter ) by a companion comparable in mass to that of a typical ring - galaxy collider .    in figure 4",
    "we show the histogram of relative velocities from those ring galaxies with redshift measurements for both the ring itself and at least one of its putative colliders .",
    "the median velocity difference for this sample is rather small ( @xmath0100  km / s ) . excluding obvious background objects with @xmath4v @xmath5 1,000  km / s , the largest two remaining velocity differences are 293 and 419  km / s .",
    "we conclude that the majority of these systems are bound and that if simulations are a guide then there will be a rapid merging of these pairs in the course of the next passage .",
    "computer simulations of galaxy interactions first showed that ring galaxies could convinciungly be created by the head - on collision of a satellite galaxy with a primary disk .",
    "observations of prototypical ring galaxies , such as the cartwheel ( fosbury & hawarden 1977 ) and the lindsay - shapley ring , each confirmed the `` prediction '' in as much as colliders were found in evidence , and within the range of distances , velocities and position angles expected for head - on collisional events .",
    "the present study follows the early work of few , madore & arp ( 1986 ) and extends this confirmation of theory from a handful of galaxies to a relative complete sample of over 100 suspected and previously cataloged ring galaxies .",
    "however , there is another prediction that is fundamentally at odds with what is observed for this sample of ring galaxies .",
    "that prediction comes from @xmath6-cdm cosmology in which many more satellite galaxies are expected to be orbiting central galaxies than are in fact observed .",
    "making these satellites non - luminous ( be it by supernova events , by interactions , by initial conditions , or by fiat ) does not prevent them from interacting gravitationally , and as such they too should be responsible for creating rings through collisions in direct proportion to their numbers with respect to their luminous colliding counterparts .",
    "the astonishing fact is that _ there is not a single compelling example of a ring galaxy without a plausible optical collider .",
    "_ there is no isolated cartwheel in the sky ; there are no smoke rings without the smoking gun . and there should be many .",
    "we state this simple fact and leave a more detailed discussion of this point and its implications for @xmath6-cdm cosmology to the companion paper by madore et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",

    "atlas_. and , of course , this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration . finally , we thank ian steer for bringing the ring galaxy ic  1908 to our attention .",
