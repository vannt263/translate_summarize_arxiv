    "the focus of astronomy on the transient universe is steadily increasing because of the wealth of astrophysical information provided by time variability .",
    "examples of past and current variability surveys are the galactic microlensing surveys ( e.g. , ogle , @xcite ; moa , @xcite ; macho , @xcite ; eros , ; supermacho , @xcite ) , searches for both local ( loss , @xcite ) and cosmologically distant ( e.g. , sdss , @xcite ; cfhtls , ; essence , @xcite ) supernovae , all sky variability surveys ( e.g. , asas , @xcite ; quest , @xcite ; nsvs , @xcite ; catalina , @xcite ) and prompt @xmath2-ray burst monitors ( e.g. , batse , @xcite ; raptor , @xcite ; rotse , @xcite ; swift , @xcite ) . a complete , or even partial , listing of more directed monitoring projects would be impossible , and the scale of variability surveys continues to grow rapidly with projects such as ogle - iv ( a. udalski et al .",
    "2010 , in preparation ) , pan - starrs ( @xcite ) and lsst ( @xcite ) .",
    "a common problem for variability surveys is the classification of light curves given the enormous range of physical processes leading to variability ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "classification is well developed for simple periodic sources ( e.g. , cepheids , rr lyrae , eclipsing binaries , etc . ) and impulsive ( e.g. , microlensing ) or explosive sources ( e.g. , supernovae , novae ) , but less well developed for sources with non - periodic , continuous or very long time - scale variability such as quasars .",
    "most efforts at classification have focused on the broad spectrum of periodic sources , using the fourier amplitudes of the light curves to recognize different variable classes using a broad range of methods ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "more sophisticated methods for classification of variable objects include neural networks ( e.g. , @xcite ) and self - organizing maps ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "attempts at classifying non - periodic , continuously variable sources have largely focused on identifying quasars .",
    "@xcite found that essentially all quasars vary at some level on long time scales , with 90% of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) quasars having rms variability @xmath3 mag on a 6 year time scale .",
    "the average variability of quasars can be described by a structure function with greater variability amplitudes on longer time baselines ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and this has also been observed for smaller numbers of individually monitored quasars ( e.g. , ) .",
    "thus , variability searches for quasars ( e.g. , @xcite ; , or more recently ) generally look for non - periodic sources with long time scale variability .",
    "the most formal approach to date is that used by eyer ( 2002 ) and sumi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , where the selection criterion was based on the slope of the structure function of the light curves .",
    "these searches have generally been more successful in relatively empty extragalactic regions than in those with high stellar densities .",
    "a significant problem in these attempts is that there was no simple method to reduce a non - periodic , continuously variable light curve to a small set of numbers , such as the periods and amplitudes of a fourier series , which can be used for classification .",
    "recently , @xcite found that quasar light curves could be well modeled as a stochastic process with an exponential covariance matrix characterized by an amplitude and a time scale based on a small sample ( @xmath4 ) of quasars with multi - year light curves .",
    "physically , the model is a damped random walk , and it has a broken power law structure function consistent with studies of quasar structure functions .",
    "unfortunately , there are few large samples of quasars with extensive monitoring data . to our knowledge , there are the quasars in the sdss equatorial strip , with roughly 60 epochs over @xmath5six years ( @xcite ) , the quest survey ( @xcite ) , whose light curves are not publicly available , and any quasars lying in the microlensing survey regions .",
    "recently , @xcite used mid - ir color selection ( e.g. , @xcite , also see @xcite ) to identify a large sample of quasar candidates in the magellanic clouds .",
    "while they have yet to be spectroscopically confirmed , the nature of the selection method means that purity of the main sample of candidates should be high . by combining these candidates with the ogle - ii and ogle - iii ( @xcite ) light curves",
    ", we can verify that quasar light curves are well described by a stochastic process based on a much larger sample of objects than used by @xcite and then explore using this approach to light curve modeling for classifying light curves in general , including periodic sources .",
    "obviously , a damped random walk is not an optimal model for periodic sources , but there is no technical difficulty in modeling them using the stochastic process .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : data ] we describe the light curve data and the existing catalogs of variable sources we can use for classifying light curves . in section  [ sec : method ] we describe the mathematical model .",
    "we do not use the particular forecasting methodology of @xcite , but a more statistically optimal approach based on @xcite and @xcite that we detail in the appendix . in section  [ sec : quasars ] we examine how well the model works for the known quasars from @xcite and the @xcite quasar candidates , the distribution of quasars in the parameter space of the model and the completeness of variability selection . in section  [ sec : genvar ] we examine the problem of contamination by determining the distribution of the general population of variable lmc sources in the model parameters .",
    "we also examine how the stochastic process models treat true periodic variables . in section  [ sec : selection_quasars ] we combine these results and discuss the problem of variability selecting quasars in dense stellar fields like the lmc .",
    "we summarize our results and discuss future uses in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the data used in this paper were collected with the 1.3 m warsaw telescope at the las campanas observatory , chile during the second ( 19962000 ) and third ( 20012008 ) phases of the ogle project ( @xcite ) .",
    "the majority of the ogle data were collected in the @xmath6-band ( @xmath5 370 points per light curve in ogle - iii ) with a smaller number of points in the @xmath7-band ( @xmath5 40 points per light curve ) .",
    "the ogle - iii light curves for many common variable stars are available on the internetogle / cvs/ ] .",
    "the ogle - ii database of light curves ( @xmath6-band only ) can be accessed through several web interfacesogle / photdb/ and http://ogle.astrouw.edu.pl/ogle2/dia/ ] ( @xcite ) .",
    "we make use of published ogle samples of classical cepheids ( cep ; @xcite ) , double mode cepheids ( dcep ; @xcite ) , rr lyrae stars ( rrlyr ; @xcite ) , ogle small amplitude variable red giants ( osargs ; @xcite ) , eclipsing binaries ( ecl ; @xcite ) , ellipsoidal variable red giants ( ell ; @xcite ) , long secondary period variables ( lsps ; @xcite ) , and long period variables ( miras , lpvs , and other semiregular variables , @xcite ) in the lmc .",
    "we separately extracted the ogle - ii light curves of be stars from @xcite , @xmath5 300 ogle - ii and @xmath5 2700 ogle - iii light curves of the mid - ir selected quasar candidates from @xcite .",
    "we also reanalyzed the 109 quasars from @xcite .",
    "in addition to these specific samples we downloaded @xmath5 150,000 `` variable objects '' from six ogle - ii lmc `` inner '' fields ( sc1  sc6 ) covering about 1.3 deg@xmath8 and centered on the highest stellar density regions , and @xmath5 38,000 `` variable objects '' from the three lowest stellar density `` outer '' fields ( sc15 , sc19 , and sc20 ) .",
    "the core of this paper focuses on the analysis of the highest density inner fields as a worst case scenario for identifying quasars , with the lower stellar density outer lmc fields as a simpler comparison sample .",
    "an object was defined to be variable if the standard deviation of its light curve from a constant flux was at least twice the median photometric error ( hereafter called the variability criterion ) . a large fraction of these `` variables '' are flat light curves with small numbers of outliers , and these are removed by the following cleaning procedure .",
    "first , we correct the photometric errors following the procedure and values from @xcite",
    ". then we removed up to five significant ( @xmath9 ) outliers ( relative to their adjacent epochs ) from each light curve , where a typical ogle - ii light curve has 360 epochs . after removing the sources no longer satisfying the variability criterion ,",
    "we are left with 86,301 light curves in the inner lmc fields and 25,956 in the outer ones .",
    "the inner fields include 584 rr lyrae ( 499 `` ab '' and 85 `` c '' ) , 133 classical cepheids , 7 double mode cepheids , 6,745 osargs , 374 ellipsoidal variable red giants , 46 eclipsing binaries , 699 lsps , 1,442 lpvs and 15 be stars",
    ". we also use the 58 ogle - ii and 984 ogle - iii quasar candidates meeting the variability criterion .    on further inspection many of these `` variable '' stars",
    "are created by problems in the wings of the point spread functions ( psfs ) of bright ( variable ) stars . this has been noted in earlier studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "faint stars near bright variable stars tend to vary in phase with the bright source .",
    "we apply a three step procedure to remove these `` ghost '' variable objects .",
    "first , we mask regions near bright stars .",
    "stars brighter than @xmath10 mag are saturated in the ogle data .",
    "these stars have psf wings extending to 60 arcsec but they are not formally `` detected '' in the ogle catalogs . in order to mask these stars , we used stellar objects from the 2mass catalog ( @xcite ) brighter than @xmath11 mag .",
    "the masks are defined by rectangular regions with @xmath12 , @xmath13 around the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) position of each star , where @xmath14 arcsec .",
    "if a variable object is inside one of these regions , it is removed from the list of variables .",
    "we also masked visually identified regions which showed clear photometric problems ( a dense clump of variable objects , variables detected on a `` bloomed '' ccd line , etc . ) .",
    "our second criterion is that no variable could have any other variable object within 6 arcsec . finally , the third criterion is that no variable can have a @xmath15  mag brighter variable within 15 arcsec .",
    "these steps could be carried out with greater precision , but cleaning the ogle catalog of spurious variables is not our primary focus even if it is ultimately a limitation and is one reason for using our rather conservative variability criterion .",
    "one additional problem with the ogle - ii photometry is a result of the realuminization of the telescope s mirror .",
    "a small number of light curves show a step - like change in magnitude between seasons 2 and 3 .",
    "these light curves are identified during the visual inspection we carried out for the final selection of quasar candidates .",
    "a summary of these photometric problems is also given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we are interested in modeling random processes leading to variability .",
    "many such processes can be described by the covariance matrix @xmath16 of the signal , where we will be considering the particular case of an exponential covariance @xmath17 between epochs at @xmath18 and @xmath19 used by @xcite to model quasar light curves based on a standard method from the forecasting literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . as explained in detail by @xcite ,",
    "the physics of this process is a random walk driving term of amplitude @xmath20 balanced by a damping time scale @xmath21 for a return to the mean .",
    "it is useful to define @xmath22 and use @xmath21 and @xmath23 as our model parameters  on short time scales @xmath24 the dispersion between two points is @xmath25 while on long time scales it asymptotes to @xmath20 .",
    "computationally , there is less covariance between @xmath21 and @xmath23 than @xmath21 and @xmath20 .",
    "the power spectrum of the process is @xmath26 corresponding to white noise on long time scales @xmath27 and then a @xmath28 fall on short time scales @xmath29 .",
    "@xcite suggest that @xmath21 may be related to the thermal time scale of accretion disks .",
    "we estimate these parameters using the approach of @xcite , its generalization in @xcite and the fast computational implementation in @xcite",
    ". we will collectively refer to these as the prh method . in the appendix",
    "we summarize this approach , show how it can be used to derive the forecasting model of @xcite , and demonstrate that it is more statistically powerful than the forecasting approach while still requiring only @xmath30 operations for a light curve with @xmath31 points .",
    "operationally , we fit a light curve by maximizing the likelihood ( equation ( [ eqn : likefit ] ) ) that the light curve can be fitted by the process model to determine the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath23 ( as well as their uncertainties , if desired ) .",
    "we include the light curve mean as a simultaneously optimized linear parameter ( equations ( [ eq : a4 ] ) and ( [ eq : a7 ] ) ) . given the estimates for @xmath21 and @xmath23 , we have optimal estimates for the mean light curve at both the observed points ( equation ( [ eqn : predict ] ) ) and at any other time ( equation ( [ eq : a11 ] ) ) , as well as the variances about these means ( equations ( [ eq : a9 ] ) and ( [ eq : a12 ] ) , respectively ) . where we show these reconstructions and the `` error snakes '' defined by the variances ,",
    "there are two important points to consider when comparing them to the data points .",
    "first , these variances are the variances in the mean light curve and not the variance of the data relative to the mean light curve .",
    "the latter quantity , given in equation ( [ eqn : var1 ] ) , is defined only where there is data and so is ill - suited to showing a continuous light curve .",
    "data points will be scattered relative to the mean light curve by the combination of the variance in the mean light curve and the uncertainties in the individual data points .",
    "second , the reconstructed light curve is not an example of an individual random walk defined by the parameters ( @xmath21 and @xmath23 ) , but rather the average of all such random walks that are consistent with the observed light curve given its uncertainties .",
    "the variance in the reconstructed light curve is then the variance of these individual random walks about the mean .",
    "if we generated individual random walks constrained by the data ( see prh ) , they would track the mean light curve and ( statistically ) stay inside the `` error snake '' defined by the variances , but they would show more structure on short time scales and excursions outside the `` error snake '' consistent with the estimated variances .",
    "when we fit the model , we obtain a maximum likelihood estimate of @xmath21 and @xmath23 with log likelihood @xmath32 .",
    "there are two limiting cases for this model .",
    "first , as the time scale @xmath33 , the covariance matrix becomes a diagonal matrix @xmath34 equivalent to simply broadening the photometric errors .",
    "we refer to this limit as the `` noise '' limit with log likelihood @xmath35 .",
    "we use a cut of @xmath36 to select objects that are modeled by the exponential process . given the variability criterion from section  2 , this cut mainly eliminates variable objects with @xmath21 smaller than the mean epoch separation .",
    "the other limit @xmath37 , with likelihood @xmath38 , is the limit where we can not determine @xmath21 given the overall time span of the survey .",
    "this has not proved to be major issue with the ogle data .",
    "we can not distinguish @xmath21 from @xmath39 for only 2% of the @xmath0 ogle - ii variables and 4.5% of the ogle - iii quasar candidates .",
    "for these objects the time scale @xmath21 was set to @xmath40 .",
    "we also check for periodicity in each light curve using the lomb - scargle periodogram method as implemented by @xcite . for each light curve",
    "we note the three most likely periods @xmath41 @xmath42 and their probabilities .",
    "we used narrow notches at 1 , 1/2 , 1/3 and 1/4 of a day to minimize diurnal aliasing problems , while still being able to examine rr lyrae periods .",
    "these aliasing solutions could be improved , but this is not the focus of this paper .",
    "we classify a source as periodic if the estimated period @xmath43 is shorter than 200 days and the likelihood for the peak in the periodogram being observed at random is @xmath44 .",
    "we include a limit that periods must be shorter than 200 days because many quasars with large @xmath21 have a `` period '' satisfying @xmath44 with @xmath45  day .",
    "these solutions corresponds to fitting a sine wave to the data , and as the number of time scales @xmath21 covered by the light curves shrinks , there is an increasing likelihood that a sine wave of some period will enormously improve the goodness of fit over no variability , leading to a false positive in the periodogram .",
    "for periodic variables we should see a strong correlation between @xmath43 and @xmath21 .",
    "for our quasar samples we use the 109 known quasars from @xcite and @xmath1 mid - ir selected quasar candidates detected in the ogle - iii lmc and smc fields from @xcite .",
    "the @xcite sample is a heterogeneous mixture of macho variability selected quasars ( @xcite ) and quasars monitored at least in part for reverberation mapping ( @xcite ) .",
    "they have the advantage of being confirmed quasars , but they are a non - random sample of quasars , and many of the reverberation mapping quasars have poorly sampled light curves compared to the macho or ogle light curves .",
    "the mid - ir selected candidates have the disadvantage that they are not confirmed quasars .",
    "@xcite classified the candidates based on their mid - ir colors ( a / b for being inconsistent / consistent with a black body ) , location in the mid - ir color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ; yso / qso for whether the object is / is not in the region contaminated with young stellar objects , ysos ) and optical to mid - ir color ( a / b for whether the optical to mid - ir colors are / are not consistent with spectroscopically selected quasars ) . here",
    "we only use the `` a '' sources . based on the extragalactic sources from the agn and galaxy evolution survey ( ages , c. s. kochanek et al .",
    "2010 , in preparation ) , the qso - aa candidates , which are the majority , should be almost entirely comprised of quasars , while the other classes are likely dominated by contaminating sources .",
    "ideally , we should work with a quasar light curve that is free from contamination by the host galaxy .",
    "this can be a problem because we fit the light curves in magnitudes rather than flux ( as did @xcite ) . in magnitude space ,",
    "the effects of contamination on the process parameters are non - linear .",
    "extra contaminating flux reduces amplitudes and increases time scales , while oversubtracting any contamination has the reverse effects . for the bright , distant quasars from @xcite , @xcite and , to a large extent , @xcite , this will be a limited problem . not only are these very luminous quasars , but the observations are largely in the rest frame ultraviolet , where host galaxies have little flux . the @xcite sample will also have few sources with significant host contamination because such sources are lost as part of the mid - ir selection ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is emphatically not true of the local reverberation mapping targets . if we take the continuum light curves for mrk  279 , mrk  509 @xcite , ngc  3783 @xcite , ngc  4051 @xcite , and ngc  5548 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and then either subtract the remaining host flux in the spectroscopic apertures or add in the host flux from outside the spectroscopic apertures based on @xcite , we see significant changes in the model parameters . on average , adding the rest of the host flux ( subtracting the remaining host flux in the aperture ) reduces ( increases ) the variability amplitude by an average of @xmath46  dex ( @xmath47  dex ) and increases ( decreases ) the characteristic time scale by an average of @xmath48  dex ( @xmath49  dex ) for five sources .",
    "the effects are larger when including the remainder of the host because the spectroscopic apertures used to obtain these light curves are already excluding most of the host galaxy flux ",
    "the host flux outside the aperture is 110 times larger than the host flux in the aperture .",
    "thus , as with reverberation mapping , correlations of the process parameters with other quasar properties will be sensitive to the treatment of the host galaxy .",
    "we will not consider this problem further since we are focusing on the observed properties of quasar variability rather than their detailed interpretation .",
    "figure  [ fig : four_qso ] shows four examples of qso light curves modeled by the stochastic process .",
    "these fits are typical , and like @xcite , we find that most quasars are well modeled by the process , as illustrated by the @xmath50 distribution shown in figure  [ fig : chi2dof ] .",
    "some care is required to interpret this distribution .",
    "all objects we consider are likely to be poorly described by no variability , so the process model will always produce a reduced @xmath51 .",
    "also keep in mind that one limit of the model is simply to broaden the error bars ( the `` noise '' limit ) , which can always allow @xmath52 up to the effects of the priors on @xmath23 and @xmath21 .",
    "nonetheless , the final @xmath50 distribution is far narrower than the distribution from fitting the linear model and few objects are doing so in the `` noise limit '' corresponding to simply broadening the uncertainties .",
    "the distribution is somewhat broader than it should be for correctly estimated gaussian uncertainties . for a typical ogle - iii light curve with @xmath53 points",
    ", we expect @xmath54 . that the distribution is broader , and relatively symmetric , suggests that some of the difference lies in the accuracy of the photometric errors , since a 3% misestimation of the uncertainties is enough to cause such a shift .",
    "there is some skewness to larger @xmath50 , but this could simply be due our pruning of outliers being too conservative  it only takes two @xmath55 outliers to produce an @xmath56 shift in @xmath57 .",
    "nonetheless , we can not rule out the possibility that the process model is a poor or incomplete model for the variability physics in some objects .",
    "the detection of variability is strongly magnitude - dependent because fainter sources require larger amplitudes for variability to be detected .",
    "figure  [ fig : frac_var ] shows the fraction of mid - ir quasar candidates that pass the two variability criteria based on either ogle - ii or ogle - iii data .",
    "one advantage of the process model is that we can explicitly calculate the completeness of a survey as a function of the parameters using monte carlo simulations .",
    "at each point on a grid of the process parameters ( @xmath23 and @xmath21 ) , we randomly generate @xmath31 light curves using the temporal sampling of a randomly selected real light curve .",
    "generating simulated light curves of zero mean is trivial , since the next point @xmath58 , \\label{eqn : nextpoint}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the time interval and @xmath60 is a gaussian deviate of dispersion @xmath61 .",
    "the observed light curve is then @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the observational noise .",
    "the chain is initiated by @xmath64 .",
    "we use the mean measurement error at a given magnitude , but one could use the error estimates from a light curve matched in magnitude to the trial .",
    "next , we apply our variability criterion , that the rms of the light curve must be twice the measurement errors , and that @xmath36 , to each trial light curve .",
    "the completeness is simply the fraction of the trials which pass both selection criteria . for speed",
    ", we estimate the second criterion by using the likelihood at the input parameters for @xmath65 and the likelihood for the model with the same asymptotic variance but @xmath66 for @xmath67 .",
    "figure  [ fig : oglecomp ] shows the resulting completeness estimates for ogle - ii and ogle - iii light curves at @xmath68 , 17.5 , 18.5 , and , 19.5  mag , where the typical photometric uncertainties ( including the rescalings of section  2 ) are @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 mag for ogle - ii and @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 mag for ogle - iii . the general structure of the completeness limit is easily understood .",
    "the variability criterion can be approximated by noting that in the continuum limit , where we integrate over a continuous light curve rather examining discreet samples , the variance of a light curve described by an exponential covariance matrix relative to its mean is @xmath77,\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the ratio of the survey duration to the time scale @xmath21 .",
    "when the survey duration is long compared to the time scale ( @xmath79 ) , the signal variance is simply @xmath80 , and light curves above the diagonal line with @xmath81 will satisfy the variability criterion . when the survey is short ( @xmath82 ) , the observed variance is limited by the survey duration to @xmath83 and the completeness is high if @xmath23 is sufficiently large .",
    "the criterion that the process is distinguishable from simply increasing the error bars eliminates sources in the corner with short time scales and high amplitudes .",
    "note that the variability criterion is very conservative , because its selection limits do not improve with additional data .",
    "using only the second criterion , based on whether the process model fits better than simply expanding the measurement errors , would lead to higher completeness for longer @xmath21 and smaller @xmath23 _ but at the expense of higher false positive rates due to systematic errors in the data_. compared to the ogle - ii survey , the ogle - iii survey is more sensitive and covers a longer temporal baseline but with a larger epoch spacing , so it is more complete for large @xmath21 and smaller @xmath20 , while less complete for small @xmath21 .",
    "the completeness limit is largely determined by the variability criterion except for the corner with high amplitudes and short time scales .",
    "while not shown , the distribution of variable sources as a function of magnitude follows these completeness limits closely .",
    "figure  [ fig : qso_intro ] shows the distribution of quasars in an optical cmd , @xmath84 parameter space ( shown in detail in figure  [ fig : sig_tau_type ] ) , @xmath85magnitude space and , where available , the relationship between @xmath86 and @xmath87 at fixed @xmath21 . because the @xmath7-band light curves are poorly sampled compared to the @xmath6-band , we determine @xmath87 using the @xmath21 derived for the @xmath6-band light curve .",
    "to better understand the contamination problems we discuss later , we superpose a cmd of lmc stars based on the _ hst local group stellar photometry archive_- and @xmath6-band .",
    "these data were then binned into 0.05 mag bins in both magnitude and color and are shown as smoothed contours of 1 , 5 , 10 and 20 objects per bin in figures  [ fig : qso_intro ] , [ fig : variable_intro ] and [ fig : cmd ] . ] ( @xcite ) . on the cmd",
    "one can quickly identify the red clump ( rc ) , the red giant branch ( rgb ) and the top of the main sequence . since these are derived from small _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ fields , the sequences of higher luminosity stars are not significantly populated .",
    "we see that quasars occupy a well defined locus in the @xmath23-@xmath21 space , lying in a band with @xmath88 that roughly corresponds to an asymptotic variability of @xmath89 mag .",
    "variability time scales longer than a few 1000 days are rare , although @xmath21 is indeterminate but long for about 5% of the sample .",
    "the estimate of @xmath21 becomes very uncertain as it approaches the survey length . at very short @xmath21 ,",
    "systems are lost because they fail the @xmath36 criterion .",
    "if we focus on the qso - a sources , which are overwhelmingly going to be real quasars , we can define a shaded region in figure  [ fig : qso_intro ] ( cut 2 in section  [ sec : selection_quasars ] ) that encompasses most of these sources ( 69% of those identified as variable in ogle - iii ) .",
    "the more contaminated qso - b and yso candidates are less likely to fall into this region ( see figure  [ fig : sig_tau_type ] , tables  [ tab : results1 ] and [ tab : results2 ] ) , providing added evidence of their higher levels of contamination by lmc sources . the mid - ir quasar candidates tend to lie in the hertzsprung gap of the cmd , consistent with the typical color @xmath90 mag of @xmath91 quasars .",
    "they also show relatively achromatic variability between the @xmath7 and @xmath6 bands , with more chromaticity for small @xmath23 and larger @xmath21 sources .",
    "tables  [ tab : results1 ] and [ tab : results2 ] summarize the properties of the mid - ir selected quasars for both ogle - ii and ogle - iii light curves . if we compare the locations of the quasars in the space of the variability parameters ( figure  [ fig : sig_tau_type ] ) to the completeness estimation of figure  [ fig : oglecomp ] , it is easy to understand the magnitude dependence of the fraction of variable quasars in figure  [ fig : frac_var ] .",
    "the distribution of the quasars is a combination of intrinsic properties ( variability at rest wavelength @xmath92 for a black hole of some mass and luminosity ) , distance ( magnitude and scalings between rest - frame and observed - frame properties ) , and selection effects ( figure  [ fig : oglecomp ] ) .",
    "the observed magnitude of the quasar depends on distance and _ k_-corrections , and the variability parameters have redshift corrections ( @xmath93 and @xmath94 @xcite ) and potentially _",
    "k_-corrections for any scalings of the parameters with wavelength , such as those seen in average structure functions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our incompleteness depends on observed rather than intrinsic properties , and this makes it highly likely that our estimate of the region occupied by quasars is largely correct despite the increasing problems with completeness at fainter magnitudes .",
    "in essence , the majority of quasars which we lose due to incompleteness correspond to quasars with similar intrinsic properties at lower redshifts where they are bright enough to be included , rather than quasars with intrinsically different properties .",
    "the numbers of quasars observed to have a given set of parameters are , however , strongly dependent on the selection function , and reconstructing the true distribution will require redshifts and ( essentially ) a @xmath95 method applied to the variability selection procedure .",
    "a significant advantage of our approach is that such problems can be quantitatively addressed using the variability model .",
    "the lmc sources we consider in the next section are an illustration of the opposite limit from the quasars .",
    "since all lmc sources are at the same distance , we either detect them in this variability space given their magnitude or not .",
    "we can also examine the distribution of the @xcite quasars relative to the mid - infrared sample in figure  [ fig : sig_tau_type ] .",
    "they generally lie in the same region ( 79% are in the selection box ) , but their distribution in that region is very different .",
    "most of the macho and pg quasars lie at the large @xmath21 end of the distribution , with a few of the reverberation mapping quasars dribbling toward short @xmath21 . the macho ( @xcite ) quasars are variability selected , but the selection criterion may be a biased one compared to a ( roughly ) magnitude limited sampling of quasars .",
    "figure  [ fig : sig_tau_type ] also shows the effects of adding or subtracting host galaxy discussed above .",
    "in section  [ sec : quasars ] , we demonstrated that quasars occupy a limited region of the variability parameter space . in order to select quasars using variability , we need to examine how other variable sources populate these parameter spaces . in figure",
    "[ fig : variable_intro ] , we show the location of the general variable populations from the inner lmc fields for the same combinations of variables used for quasars in figure  [ fig : qso_intro ] .",
    "the distributions of outer field variables are similar but of lower density . where possible we have identified the variable type using the catalogs discussed in section  [ sec : data ] .",
    "tables  [ tab : results1 ] and [ tab : results2 ] summarize the statistics of selecting sources in these fields .",

    "quasar variability is less chromatic , so the amplitude ratio is another tool for separating quasars from variable stars . for these lmc fields ,",
    "this is not critical because of the large magnitude differences between many of the variable stars and quasars .",
    "however , in a field dominated by galactic sources spread over a wide range of distances , amplitude ratios have the advantage of being distance independent .",

    "these light curves have fluctuations on long time scales that are quasi - periodic over the extent of the light curve ( particularly with yearly or half - yearly aliases ) , so a sine wave fit to the data is a significantly better fit to the data than a constant .",

    "our one hypothesis for this scaling is that it can be produced if the exponential process model is dominated by how well it fits the peak of the correlation function .",
    "near the peak , the auto - correlation function of a sine wave is proportional to @xmath111 , while that of the exponential covariance matrix is @xmath112 , potentially driving the @xmath109 scaling .",

    "it is clear , however , that the relationship between @xmath21 and @xmath43 depends on sampling rather than being universal .",
    "we can now combine the results from sections  [ sec : quasars ] and [ sec : genvar ] to define selection criteria for isolating quasars from other variable sources .",
    "presently this is limited to searching for candidate quasars in the 1.3  deg@xmath8 ( 0.65  deg@xmath8 ) covered by the ogle - ii inner ( outer ) fields in order to explore how well we can find quasars while avoiding contamination .",
    "we limit the analysis to sources with @xmath113 based on the completeness estimates in section  [ sec : quasars ] .",
    "there should be very few quasars in this region , so this is really a test of contamination levels in a field with very high densities of stellar variables .",

    "we will simultaneously apply the selection method to the broader sample of ogle - ii and ogle - iii quasar light curves to examine their effects on completeness .",
    "we select quasars in four steps , starting with two that will be generic to any set of light curves from any location ( cut 1  non - periodicity , cut 2  variability properties of quasars ) , and then applying those that depend on the specific field ( cut 3 ) and the availability of light curves in multiple bands ( cut 4 ) .",

    "the lower limits are designed to remove most cepheids , rr lyrae , osargs , ellipsoidal variable red giants , long secondary period variables , slowly pulsating b stars , @xmath103 cephei stars , active giants and subgiants , and yso-(ab ) objects .",
    "the upper limits remove many of the long period and long secondary period variables .",
    "this criterion will still leave significant contamination from several of the variable star populations along the left ( low @xmath23 ) and bottom edges .",
    "these are blue variables , active giants and subgiants and rr lyrae .",
    "this cut removes 97% of ells , 92% of osargs , 45% of lsps , and 41% of lpvs passing cut 1 .",
    "_ cut 3 . _",
    "the third cut takes advantage of the fact that almost all the contaminating sources are at a common distance and largely consist of relatively bright giant stars .",
    "it is defined by a wedge in @xmath101magnitude space that isolates the ogle - iii quasars .",
    "we first require quasar candidates to be fainter than @xmath122  mag since such bright quasars are very rare , while the osargs , classical cepheids , eclipsing binaries , ellipsoidal variable red giants and long period variables are all brighter than @xmath123 mag given the distance to the lmc . a second limit , @xmath124 , separates the rr lyrae , double mode cepheids , ecls , some ells , spbs , @xmath103 cep , ags and asgs , which are to the right of the quasar region .",

    "cut 3 would need to be adjusted for other background environments , such as the galactic bulge , where similar variable stars are @xmath126 mag brighter than in the lmc ( depending on the amount of extinction ) .    _",

    "we also summarize the effects on the sub - categories of the mid - ir selected samples , where we expect to eliminate more of the heavily contaminated qso - b and yso classes than the relatively high purity qso - a class .",
    "recall from section  [ sec : quasars ] that we lose a large fraction of the quasars from the two requirements for being considered a variable because most quasars are relatively faint compared to the depths of the ogle data .",

    "we evaluate this based on the on the @xmath1 ( @xmath130 ) mid - ir selected quasar candidates from @xcite with ogle - iii ( ogle - ii ) light curves as well as the smaller @xcite sample .",
    "the biggest problem for variability selected quasars from these samples is that most quasars will be faint .",
    "while we can identify 2716 ( 310 ) of our mid - ir quasars in the ogle - iii ( ogle - ii ) data , only 1139 ( 215 ) are bright enough ( @xmath113 mag ) to plausibly detect quasar variability ( see figure  [ fig : frac_var ] ) . for the full ogle - iii ( ogle - ii ) samples , 984 ( 58 )",
    "pass the basic variability criterion of section  [ sec : data ] , while 635 ( 58 ) of the @xmath113 mag candidates pass this criterion .",
    "adding the noise criterion , @xmath36 , we find 619 ( 848 ) for ogle - iii and 55 ( 55 ) for ogle - ii , brighter than @xmath113 mag ( no magnitude limit ) .",
    "the difference in the fraction of variable objects in the two phases of the ogle survey is explained by the added depth ( 0.3 mag ) and duration ( 4 versus 8 years ) of the ogle - iii survey . by design ,",
    "the remaining cuts have little effect on the quasar candidates , although we lose a larger fraction of the non - qso - a sub - samples , as we would expect given their higher levels of contamination .",
    "after applying the first three cuts to the variable objects , we are left with 65% of the qso - a sample .",
    "we can apply only cuts 1 and 2 to the @xcite sample , and 65% of the sources pass the cuts . cut 4 removes an additional 7% of the ogle - iii qso - aa objects .",
    "finally , all four cuts are met by 61% ( 63% ) of the ogle - iii qso - aa quasar candidates with no faint magnitude limit ( within @xmath131 mag ) and 17% of the ogle - ii candidates .",
    "thus , following this approach can yield variability - selected samples of quasars with moderate completeness .",
    "next we examine how well we reject other variable sources , focusing on our analysis of the central region of the lmc .",
    "we only discuss the sample including masks and isolation criteria ( see section  [ sec : data ] ) , but report the results for the full , unpruned sample as well in tables  [ tab : results1 ] and [ tab : results2 ] .",
    "the selection cuts are very effective at reducing the numbers of candidate sources , going from @xmath132 ( @xmath133 ) sources passing the variability criterion in the inner ( outer ) fields to only 58 ( 2 ) candidate quasars . in the outer fields with fewer stars ,",
    "the contamination is remarkably low .    of the 58 remaining ogle - ii candidates in the inner fields ,",
    "3 are also mid - ir selected quasars .",
    "there are 63 ( 41 qso - a ) ogle - ii sources in the same fields , 24 ( 12 ) passing the two initial variability criteria , showing that the biggest problem for quasars is recognizing variability given the depth of the data .",
    "the mid - ir quasar selection method is not perfect , in particular it tends to miss lower redshift quasars with significant mid - ir emission from the host galaxy ( @xcite ) , so some of the remaining , unidentified candidates may be real quasars . for the @xcite quasar number counts ,",
    "we expect of order @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 quasars brighter than @xmath114 , @xmath115 and , @xmath116  mag in this 1.3 deg@xmath8 region , compared to 6 , 16 and 41 qso - aa candidates in ogle - ii .",
    "we examined the light curves of all 58 objects that passed the four criteria . on visual inspection , the majority seem to be created by photometric problems in the wings of other stars , long period variable stars just above the rcg , stars in the wings of high proper motion stars ( see @xcite ) , blue and be stars , eruptive variables , novae / supernovae , nova - like variable , unidentified types of variable stars , and quasar candidates . of the non - mid - ir sources ,",

    "we are left with only 2 candidates .",
    "on inspection we find no plausible qso candidates .",
    "none of the ogle - ii light curves of the 43 mid - ir selected candidates ( 29 qso - aa ) from the outer fields passes all the criteria .",
    "in fact , only two qso - aa and two yso - aa objects with ogle - ii light curves pass the two initial variability criteria .",
    "periodograms to recognize periodically varying sources and begin their classification are a standard astronomical tool . here",
    "we introduce an equally simple approach to classifying continuously varying sources that are not periodic and explored the properties of large samples of variable sources in the lmc and smc using data from the ogle - ii and ogle - iii microlensing projects .",
    "we modeled the sources as a damped random walk , a stochastic process with an exponential covariance matrix characterized by a scaled amplitude @xmath23 , a time scale @xmath21 , and an asymptotic variance on long time scales of @xmath139 .",
    "this model was introduced by @xcite , who used a forecasting approach to estimate the parameters that is not as statistically powerful as the prh method used here .",
    "extracting the damped random walk parameters is no more complex than obtaining a periodogram , so it can be easily used to characterize any light curve .",
    "we first applied this method to a much larger sample of quasars than @xcite by using the mid - ir selected quasars from @xcite that also have ogle - ii or ogle - iii light curves .",
    "we have verified the suggestion by @xcite that quasar light curves are well modeled by the damped random walk process .",
    "moreover , we find that quasars occupy a well defined region of the parameter space of the model , allowing us to design a simple quantitative method for the variability selection of quasars .",
    "the details of the approach will likely require some modifications as larger samples of quasars are analyzed and the method is applied in regions with different sources of stellar contamination , but the broad outline should survive .",
    "we also note that the model allows quantitative estimation of completeness in variability selected quasar samples and can estimate the detection ranges needed for computing luminosity functions or other population statistics .    while @xcite are certainly correct that a damped random walk corresponding to an exponential covariance matrix models quasar variability well , it is less clear that the correlations between the model parameters and the luminosity or black hole masses of quasars are robust .",
    "since we lack redshifts for our quasar sample we can not explore this in detail , but we note two potential systematic problems in the @xcite analysis .",
    "first , the distribution of the @xcite quasar sample may be a biased sampling of the quasar distribution .",
    "it appears to be biased toward sources with long time variability time scales compared to the mid - ir quasar sample .",
    "second , most of the leverage for determining the slopes in the relations between @xmath21 and @xmath23 and the quasar mass and luminosity in @xcite come from the relatively low black hole mass and luminosity reverberation mapping quasars .",
    "host galaxy contamination is a major issue for these systems @xcite , and we find that this also holds for estimates of the variability process parameters because light curves in magnitudes are non - linearly distorted by contamination .",
    "thus , the slopes of the @xcite correlations may strongly depend on the treatment of these hosts . just as for the reverberation mapping studies , we should really measure the variability parameters of the quasar with no diluting contribution from the host galaxy , but this is virtually impossible to do for large samples .",
    "this problem could be avoided by modeling the time variable flux rather than modeling the time varying magnitudes , but the meaning of @xmath23 then becomes strongly distance dependent and fractional variability , as represented by variability in magnitudes , probably has greater physical meaning .",
    "these issues are not a concern for simply classifying light curves .    we developed a set of selection cuts to try to identify quasars based on their variability , and 63% ( 17% ) of the variable quasars in the qso - a sources in the ogle - iii ( ogle - ii ) surveys pass the selection criteria . in a lower stellar density field",
    "this can be improved by using more liberal selection criteria .",
    "if we apply the same cuts to the 10,000 ( 600 ) ogle - ii variable sources in these high density inner ( lower density outer ) fields , only 58 ( 2 ) candidates survive , of which 3 ( 0 ) are mid - ir selected quasar candidates . after visual inspection ,",
    "only 1 ( 0 ) of the other sources is a quasar candidate .",
    "most of the rest are artifacts that could be avoided by better pruning the input catalogs .",
    "the remaining sources are blue and eruptive variables , variable giants and supergiants .",
    "while 8593% contamination ( depending on how we count remaining artifacts ) seems poor , it was achieved when searching for rare extragalactic sources in an extremely high density stellar field ( @xmath140 stars and @xmath5 8,000 variable stars / deg@xmath8 compared to @xmath141 quasars / deg@xmath8 with @xmath142 mag ) , and the bulk of the false positives were easy to recognize by visual inspection .",
    "if we add a color cut for @xmath91 quasars ( @xmath90 mag ) we can also greatly reduce the residual contamination . in the outer lmc fields ( @xmath143 stars and @xmath144 variable stars / deg@xmath8 ) or an extragalactic field ( @xmath145 stars and a small number of variable stars / deg@xmath8 ) there will be little difficulty with contamination .",
    "moreover , it is clear that the ogle - ii data are too shallow to search for quasars in small areas compared to ogle - iii .",
    "clearly the next steps are to apply this approach systematically .",
    "here we carried out a limited analysis of ogle - ii and ogle - iii data pending the general availability of the full sample of ogle - iii light curves .",

    "the simplest means of doing so is simply to pad the data vector @xmath177 with additional fake points @xmath178 that have infinite measurement uncertainties in the sense that @xmath179 for these points . for simplicity",
    "we consider the case without additional linear parameters .",
    "we partition the signal and noise matrices as @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath182 and @xmath182 and @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath185 for the data - data , fake - fake , data - fake , and fake - data blocks of the matrices . substituting into equation  ( [ eqn : predict ] ) , we find that the estimate of the true light curve for the measured data points is the result we would obtain without having padded the data vector , and that the estimate of the light curve at the additional points is @xmath186 with variance relative to the mean light curve of @xmath187 these two expressions define the mean light curves and the `` error snakes '' shown in figures  [ fig : four_qso ] and [ fig : lc ] .",
    "mathematically , the mean light curve is the weighted average of all process light curves described by parameters @xmath162 that are statistically consistent with the data , and the variance is the scatter of these light curves about this mean .",
    "we can use these results to `` forecast '' the light curve by noting that we can express the expected value at epoch @xmath188 in terms of the measurement at @xmath189 and the forecast for @xmath189 based on the @xmath190 earlier data points . in component language , @xmath191 where @xmath192 , and @xmath193 where @xmath194 . for an exponential covariance matrix ,",
    "@xmath195 where @xmath196 .",
    "if you partition the @xmath197 matrix of equation  ( [ eqn : next ] ) into the @xmath198 part used to estimate @xmath199 and the remaining column vectors and scalar and then use the standard method for inverting a partitioned matrix you find that @xmath200 where @xmath201 and @xmath202 is the measurement error for @xmath203 . to complete the identification with @xcite , we note that the variance between the data point @xmath203 and the prediction @xmath199 is @xmath204 so @xcite s @xmath205 .",
    "note that equations  ( [ eqn : var1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : var2 ] ) differ because @xmath199 in equation  ( [ eqn : first ] ) does not depend on the data point @xmath203 , but it does depend on that data point in equation  ( [ eqn : var1 ] ) . making this substitution , we recover the forecasting expression from @xcite where @xmath206 similarly one can work out the variance in @xmath207 to find that @xmath208 which then gives the second of the forecasting equations in @xcite , @xmath209 where @xmath210 is the diagonal element of the covariance matrix . @xcite initialized their predicted time series at the process mean , while the prh approach would initialize it to the first measurement . for this forecasting approach ,",
    "the likelihood of the data given any parameters is then @xmath211 instead of equation  ( [ eqn : likefit ] ) .",
    "having demonstrated that the @xcite forecasting method can be derived from the prh approach , we next address the relative virtues of the two methods .",
    "an apparent advantage of the forecasting approach is that it is computationally @xmath212 to compute equation  ( [ eqn : likefor ] ) , while at first glance it is @xmath213 to compute equation  ( [ eqn : likefit ] ) because of the matrix inversion .",
    "this is not the case for the exponential correlation function ( equation  ( [ eqn : cfunc ] ) ) because its inverse is tridiagonal @xcite .",
    "if we rewrite the matrix @xmath214 in equation  ( [ eqn : likefor ] ) as @xmath215 , then for a diagonal ( or even tridiagonal ) noise matrix @xmath31 , all the matrix calculations , including the determinant , in equation  ( [ eqn : likefit ] ) , can be carried out in @xmath212 operations .",
    "the total number of operations and the complexity of the implementation is somewhat higher if one includes the steps needed to automatically marginalize over the light curve mean using the linear parameters , but this then avoids having it as a parameter which must be optimized as part of the fit . using the fast method from @xcite requires the data to be time ordered and non - overlapping ( @xmath216 ) since @xmath16 is singular if any @xmath217 for @xmath218  data points at identical ( or nearly identical , in the sense that @xmath219 ) times should be combined before applying the analysis , and some care is required to stably compute the determinants .",
    "balancing the computational complexity is that the prh method is more statistically powerful because it uses all the information in the light curve simultaneously .",
    "in essence , for parameter estimation we should use all available data to predict @xmath207 not just the preceding data .",
    "we can demonstrate this by generating monte carlo light curves using the exponential process , estimating the parameters using both methods and examining the relative scatters in the recovered values .",
    "we use priors of @xmath220 and @xmath221 , as logarithmic priors are generally standard for positive definite but otherwise scale free variables .",
    "this differs from @xcite , who assumed a uniform prior for @xmath23 and @xmath222 where @xmath59 is the typical spacing of the data points .",
    "we took the same set of 109 quasars that @xcite considered and fitted them with both approaches , finding results in reasonable agreement .",
    "we then took the parameters of these best fits and generated monte carlo realizations of the light curves ( equation  ( [ eqn : nextpoint ] ) ) with the same time sampling and measurement uncertainties of the original light curves .",
    "we then re - fitted the monte carlo light curves using both methods and examined the differences between the input and output parameters . the results , as shown in figure  [ fig : compare ] , unambiguously show that the prh method produces superior results , as would be expected from using all rather than only part of the correlation information in the data .",
