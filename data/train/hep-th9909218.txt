    "in the context of @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills theories in four - dimensional spacetime , bps magnetic monopoles are referred to as 1/2-bps states , because they are invariant under half of the supersymmetry . recently ,",
    "1/4-bps states have also been considered .",
    "1/4-bps states are invariant under only a quarter of the supersymmetry and form somewhat larger supermultiplets .    generally , there are six scalar fields in @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills theory . for a configuration to be 1/4 bps , all but two of these scalar fields must vanish and the remaining two must satisfy two field equations called bps equations .",
    "the first of these equations requires that the gauge fields @xmath3 and one of the scalar fields , @xmath4 , must satisfy the usual bogomolny equation for bps monopoles .",
    "the second bps equation requires that the other scalar field , @xmath5 , must satisfy the covariant laplace equation in the background of the solution , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , of the first bps equation .",
    "a point in the moduli space of 1/2-bps configurations corresponds to a unique 1/4-bps configuration ; the field @xmath5 is determined uniquely .",
    "this means the contribution of @xmath5 to the mass of the 1/4-bps state is a potential function over the moduli space .",
    "the contribution of @xmath5 to the mass is referred to as the electric part of the mass , or simply , the electric mass .",
    "it is thought that there may be a moduli space approximation to the low energy dynamics of 1/4-bps states with kinetic term given by the usual moduli space metric and with potential term given by half the electric mass .",
    "it is difficult to solve the two bps equations .",
    "the most tractable approach is to employ the nahm formulation . using the nahm formulation ,",
    "the fields were found for a simple case in @xcite .",
    "another approach is to study spherically symmetric solutions and use a spherical ansatz to solve the field equations @xcite .",
    "however , past experience has shown that a great deal can be learned about 1/2-bps configurations , without knowing the explicit fields .",
    "it appears that this is also the case with 1/4-bps configurations .",
    "the solutions of the first bps equations are described by moduli space coordinates and there is a natural metric on the moduli space . in a number of examples ,",
    "this metric is known even though the fields are not .",
    "furthermore , the electric charge and the electric part of the bps energy can be obtained from the moduli space metric without solving the bps equations for the fields @xcite .    in this paper , we show that the electric mass may also be calculated directly from the nahm data , without having to calculate either the fields or the metric .",
    "we apply this to two @xmath2 examples . in the first example",
    ", @xmath4 is a @xmath6-monopole . in this case ,",
    "the electric mass is already know from more direct calculations @xcite . in the second example",
    ", the @xmath4 field is the @xmath7)$]-monopole considered by dancer @xcite .",
    "the electric mass has not been previously calculated for this case and , so , it is discussed in some detail .",
    "a @xmath7)$]-monopole is a monopole in the theory with @xmath2 symmetry broken to @xmath8 by the asymptotic value of @xmath4 . in other words",
    ", @xmath2 has two simple roots , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and the asymptotic value of @xmath4 is perpendicular to @xmath10 , permitting a @xmath8 of gauge inequivalent large gauge transformations of the fields .",
    "this means that the theory has two types of monopoles : massive @xmath9 monopoles and massless @xmath10 monopoles .",
    "the nonabelian case is usefully thought of as a limit of the generic case , where the asymptotic value of @xmath4 is not perpendicular to either root @xcite .",
    "a @xmath7)$]-monopole is composed of two @xmath9 monopoles and one @xmath10 monopole .",
    "the moduli space of @xmath7)$]-monopoles describes the solutions of the first bps equation .",
    "the net magnetic charge is purely abelian and the massless @xmath10 monopole forms a nonabelian cloud surrounding the two massive @xmath9 monopoles .",
    "however , this discussion refers only to the contribution that @xmath4 makes to the mass .",
    "the asymptotic value of the second higgs field , @xmath5 , breaks the symmetry further to @xmath11 .",
    "this symmetry breaking pattern is required for genuine 1/4-bps configurations .",
    "when the asymptotic values of the two higgs fields are proportional , the higgs fields are proportional everywhere .",
    "this means that there is really only one active scalar field and the configuration is 1/2 bps . in a genuine 1/4-bps configuration ,",
    "the @xmath10 monopole is not massless if the contribution of the @xmath5 field is included .",
    "a similar situation arose in the @xmath12,1)$ ] case recently considered by one of us @xmath13 @xcite . here , the @xmath14 symmetry is broken to @xmath15 by the @xmath4 field and is broken maximally by the @xmath5 field . due to the recent progress in the understanding of 1/4-bps configurations , some remarks",
    "can now be made about the @xmath7)$ ] case which also apply to the @xmath12,1)$ ] case .",
    "it is emphasized that the precise position of the massless @xmath10 monopole is important in the 1/4-bps configuration .",
    "as far as the field @xmath4 is concerned , the position of the massless monopole can be transformed by the unbroken symmetry .",
    "in fact , if a massless monopole is considered as the massless limit ; then some of the moduli of the monopole become , in the limit , parameters of the orbit of the unbroken symmetry . on the other hand ,",
    "the asymptotic @xmath5 field breaks the @xmath16 symmetry and so the solution depends on the position of the massless monopole .",
    "similarly , if there were several identical massless monopoles , the solution of the second bps equation would depend on the moduli of the massless monopoles .",
    "recently , a low energy effective lagrangian for the moduli dynamics of 1/4-bps configurations has been found @xcite .",
    "it consists of a kinetic part and a potential part .",
    "the kinetic part is given by the moduli space metric of the corresponding 1/2-bps monopole .",
    "the potential part is given by half of the electric mass .",
    "the non - relativistic lagrangian has a bps bound , and the bps configuration saturating this bound turns out to be the 1/4-bps field theoretic configuration .",
    "naive criteria , for specifying the valid region of this low energy lagrangian , require that the kinetic energy and the potential energy are much smaller than the rest mass of the monopoles involved .",
    "when massless monopoles are involved , it is not clear whether there is any valid region . however ,",
    "if such a region exists , it would have to be one where the energy is smaller than the magnetic mass of the configuration . in this paper , we assume that a valid region exists and we explore the consequences . the picture which emerges appears to be consistent .",
    "the potential in the @xmath7)$ ] case is quite interesting .",
    "it is repulsive and the relative electric charge between dyons generates an effective attractive force .",
    "there is a minimum allowed electric charge , which matches nicely with the string picture .",
    "the balance of the attractive electric force and the repulsive force leads to the bps configurations . moreover ,",
    "when we try to remove the apparently massless @xmath10 monopole away from the @xmath9 monopoles , it turns out that the potential grows linearly with distance from the two @xmath9 monopoles to the @xmath10 monopole .",
    "this is a sort of confinement . of course",
    ", it would be strange if we could take out the massless monopole with a finite energy cost since it would then appear to be both massive and massless .    in section [ revbps ] ,",
    "there is a review of the physics of 1/4-bps configurations . in section [ nfsec ]",
    ", we discuss 1/4-bps configurations in the nahm formulation and derive a formula for the electric mass .",
    "this formula is used to calculate the known electric mass potential in the @xmath6 case . in section [ dsect ] ,",
    "the formula is used to calculate the mass of 1/4-bps states in the @xmath7)$ ] case .",
    "a string configuration equivalent to this state is proposed .",
    "finally , we conclude with some remarks in section [ dissec ] .",
    "a @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills theory has a six component scalar field .",
    "four of these components are zero in 1/4-bps configurations @xcite and it is possible to choose two independent orthogonal higgs fields @xmath5 and @xmath4 satisfying @xmath17 and @xmath18=0\\label{cl}\\ ] ] where the coupling constant , @xmath19 , is set to one . in this context , these are referred to as the first and second bps equations .",
    "the gauge group is @xmath20 .",
    "thus , @xmath3 and @xmath4 satisfy the usual bogomolny equation for 1/2-bps monopoles and @xmath5 satisfies a covariant laplace equation in the background of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the equation satisfied by @xmath5 is the same as the equation satisfied by a large gauge transformation of @xmath3 and @xmath4 obeying the background gauge condition .",
    "the appearance of the bogomolny equation apparently reflects the fact that some of the supersymmetry is unbroken .",
    "there is no bogomolny equation in the non - bps case , where three of the scalar fields are active @xcite .",
    "a general configuration has both magnetic and electric charges .",
    "asymptotically , the higgs field lies in the gauge orbit of @xmath21 where the dot product of bold quantities is in the cartan space .",
    "the mass of the corresponding configuration is @xmath22 thus , there are two contributions to the mass : @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "these are referred to as the magnetic mass and the electric mass respectively .",
    "the solutions of the first bps equation , ( [ firstbps ] ) , are 1/2-bps monopoles .",
    "generally , the asymptotic value , @xmath25 , of @xmath4 breaks @xmath20 to @xmath26 and there exists a unique set of simple roots @xmath27 such that @xmath28 for @xmath29 . for each simple root",
    ", there is a fundamental monopole with four zero modes . for any magnetic charge @xmath30 with non - negative @xmath31",
    ", there exists a family of 1/2-bps solutions of the first bps equation , called @xmath32-monopoles  @xcite .",
    "usually @xmath33 .",
    "the solutions are uniquely characterized by their moduli space coordinates .",
    "thus , any specific solution of the first bps equation is given by the coordinates @xmath34 of the moduli space of these 1/2-bps monopoles .",
    "the dimension of the moduli space is @xmath35 and there exists a naturally defined metric on this moduli space , given by the @xmath36 norm of gauge - orthogonal field variations .",
    "the magnetic mass is the same for all monopoles with the same magnetic charge and is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the mass of the @xmath39th type of monopole .",
    "the symmetry breaking is not maximal when @xmath40 for some @xmath39 .",
    "the corresponding fundamental monopole becomes massless and does not exist in isolation .",
    "however , when the total magnetic charge @xmath41 is purely abelian , so that @xmath42 for @xmath40 , there are massless monopoles with @xmath43 .",
    "these massless monopoles appear as a nonabelian cloud surrounding the massive monopoles . as long as the total magnetic charge remains purely abelian",
    "the dimension of the moduli space does not change in the massless limit @xcite .",
    "however , the meaning of the moduli space coordinate changes from the point of view of 1/2-bps configurations . the position and phase of massless monopoles become the unbroken nonabelian gauge orbit parameters and gauge invariant cloud parameters .    a solution of the second bps equation can be found for each solution of the first bps equation .",
    "in fact , the second bps equation is identical to the zero mode equation for gauge - orthogonal large gauge transformations of the fields .",
    "there are @xmath44 such zero modes since @xmath20 breaks into @xmath44 abelian @xmath45 groups . from the solution of the second bps equations , the electric charges carried by the @xmath31",
    "@xmath46 monopoles can be read off from the asymptotic field ( [ asympa ] ) .",
    "thus , when the asymptotic value , @xmath25 , leaves some of the nonabelian gauge symmetry unbroken , the 1/2-bps configurations may involve massless monopoles .",
    "the asymptotic value @xmath47 may preserve the unbroken symmetry by @xmath25 or break it further .",
    "when there is an unbroken nonabelian symmetry group , there may be non - vanishing , nonabelian electric charge for a 1/4-bps configurations .",
    "this is shown in a simple case in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we first review the nahm formulation for the first bps equation .",
    "we then derive a formula for the electric mass using the nahm formulation .",
    "there is a complication when two adjacent charges are equal , as in the @xmath6 case . in subsection",
    "[ eacsec ] , we extend our formula to these cases .",
    "the specific example of the @xmath6 case is considered in subsection [ 11case ] . in the next section ,",
    "the formula is applied to the @xmath7)$ ] case .",
    "bps monopoles are classified by nahm data @xcite .",
    "nahm data are a 4-vector of skewhermetian matrix functions of one variable over the subdivided interval defined by the eigenvalues of the asymptotic higgs field @xmath48 . inside each subinterval , the data satisfy the nahm equation @xmath49=[t_j , t_k]\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is a cyclic permutation of @xmath51 .",
    "each subinterval corresponds to one of the unbroken @xmath45 subgroups of @xmath20 and the magnetic charge around that @xmath45 determines the size of the nahm matrices over that subinterval .",
    "thus , a @xmath32-monopole with higgs field at spatial infinity is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 , corresponds to nahm data over the interval @xmath54 .",
    "over @xmath55 , the nahm matrices are @xmath56 , over @xmath57 they are @xmath58 and so on .",
    "it is useful to illustrate nahm data with a graph , taking the value @xmath31 over the @xmath39th interval .",

    "the boundary conditions are different when @xmath67 . in this case",
    "the data carrying though may have a rank one discontinuity .",

    "depending on how strong the boundary conditions satisfied are , @xmath77 is a large or small gauge transformation .",

    "the precise form of boundary conditions on the group transformations and the criterion distinguishing large and small gauge transformations of the nahm data are discussed for specific examples in @xcite .    in @xcite , the nahm formulation of 1/4-bps states",
    "is derived by applying the fourier analysis methods of @xcite to the adhm formulation of the laplace equation for an instanton background @xcite . by partially performing the adhmn construction @xmath79",

    "a technique is now presented which simplifies the calculation of the mass in the nahm formulation .",

    "an expression is derived for the mass of a 1/4-bps state as a function over the monopole moduli space .",
    "the argument that is used there is reversed to allow us to write the mass in terms of the solution to the covariant laplace equation on nahm data .",

    "it is more difficult in more trivial examples , where @xmath97 is proportional to the identity . in these cases",
