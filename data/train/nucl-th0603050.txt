    "<S> the rapidity dependence of the single- and double- neutron to proton ratios of nucleon emission from isospin - asymmetric but mass - symmetric reactions zr+ru and ru+zr at energy range @xmath0 a mev and impact parameter range @xmath1 fm is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the reaction system with isospin - asymmetry and mass - symmetry has the advantage of simultaneously showing up the dependence on the symmetry energy and the degree of the isospin equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the beam energy- and the impact parameter dependence of the slope parameter of the double neutron to proton ratio ( @xmath2 ) as function of rapidity are quite sensitive to the density dependence of symmetry energy , especially at energies @xmath3 a mev and reduced impact parameters around @xmath4 . here </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry energy effect on the @xmath2 is enhanced , as compared to the single neutron to proton ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the degree of the equilibrium with respect to isospin ( isospin mixing ) in terms of the @xmath2 is addressed and its dependence on the symmetry energy is also discussed .    high energy collision of heavy ions provides a unique tool to study the unbroken properties of dense nuclear matter at finite temperature , outside of the reach of conventioned nuclear physics @xcite . the fopi collaboration has recently performed the mixing experiment by using four mass 96 + 96 systems @xmath5ru+@xmath5ru , @xmath6zr+@xmath6zr , @xmath5ru+@xmath6zr , and @xmath6zr+@xmath5ru to investigate the degrees of the isospin - equilibrium in the intermediate energy heavy ion collisions ( hics ) @xcite . it was found that complete isospin equilibration is not reached by comparing the emitted proton number counted in rapidity ( see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of taking mixed reactions is that the isospin asymmetry shows up more obviously because the effects of the iso - scalar part of the equation of state ( eos ) largely cancel . </S>",
    "<S> this advantage could also be used for probing the density dependence of the symmetry energy . </S>",
    "<S> so far the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy , @xmath7 , with @xmath8 being the reduced nuclear density , is still largely uncertain , although a lot of theoretical and experimental efforts have been undertaken in the past decade @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the symmetry energy has been extracted to @xmath9 at subnormal densities by comparing with experimental data @xcite when a free nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) elastic cross section has been used @xcite , while @xmath10 after considering partly medium modifications of the nucleon transport @xcite were subtracted . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry energy can be investigated by the double neutron to proton and @xmath11 ratios . </S>",
    "<S> the neutron - rich @xmath12 system and more isospin - symmetric @xmath13 system serve as robust probes of the nuclear symmetry energy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a very attractive feature of taking double ratios is the fact that the systematic errors can be strongly reduced , while the sensitivity of the symmetry energy is close to the single neutron to proton and @xmath11 ratios .    in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> we take two sets of isospin - asymmetric but mass - symmetric reactions , zr+ru and ru+zr , to study the symmetry energy effect on the rapidity dependence of both , single as well as double unbound neutron to proton ratios . </S>",
    "<S> we take advantage of the mixing reactions to study the influence of the isospin dependent part of the eos on the equilibration process . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the slope of the double neutron to proton ratio as distributed in the rapidity space is  for mixing reactions  closely related to degree of isospin equilibration . the urqmd transport model has been updated for simulating intermediate energy hics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is also used for the calculations presented in this work . a soft equation of state ( s - eos ) </S>",
    "<S> is adopted @xcite ( except otherwise stated ) . </S>",
    "<S> we consider here two sets of symmetry energy parameterizations : @xmath14 with @xmath15 ( soft ) and @xmath16 ( hard ) . </S>",
    "<S> a non - relativistic medium modification of the nucleon - nucleon elastic cross section is also considered here ( please see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> the method to construct the freeze - out clusters is the same as presented in our previous work @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the rapidity ( @xmath17 in the center - of - mass system ) dependence of unbound neutrons and protons in zr+ru and ru+zr reactions at the beam energies @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 a mev and at the reduced impact parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath4 , and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the maximum impact parameter leading to nuclear reactions by adopting sharp - cutoff approximation . the calculated rapidity dependence of the neutron to proton `` @xmath27 '' ratios for zr+ru and ru+zr reactions are shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] ( a)-(d ) for @xmath18 a mev , @xmath28 in plot ( a ) ; @xmath29 a mev , @xmath28 in ( b ) ; @xmath29 a mev , @xmath23 in ( c ) ; and @xmath30 a mev , @xmath23 in ( d ) . if equilibrium with respect to the isospin degree of freedom was reached , the rapidity distributions of the neutron to proton ratios for the two different mixing reactions should coincide with each other . </S>",
    "<S> figs.[fig1 ] ( a ) and ( b ) show clearly that for @xmath28 equilibrium ( with respect to isospin degree of freedom ) is not reached , because the centroid of the rapidity dependence of the neutron to proton ratio is not located at mid - rapidity @xcite . for zr+ru reactions , the neutron to proton ratio distribution peaks at the positive rapidity , while for the inverse ru+zr reactions , the distribution peaks at the negative rapidity . </S>",
    "<S> the rapidity dependence of the neutron to proton ratio is symmetric with respect to @xmath31 for central reactions at high beam energy ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( d ) ) , where the equilibration is nearly reached . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to see that the statistics in the urqmd calculations is perfectly guaranteed since the calculated results for zr+ru and ru+zr reactions are symmetrically distributed very well with respect to @xmath31 , as one expects . </S>",
    "<S> this is also a fundamental but important checkup in the experimental side . as seen for reactions at @xmath29 a mev and @xmath23 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( c ) , the rapidity distribution of the neutron to proton ratio almost coincides for reactions zr+ru and ru+zr when the soft - symmetry energy is chosen , but it deviates strongly when the stiff - symmetry energy is chosen . </S>",
    "<S> this shows the closely relationship between the effect of the symmetry energy and the equilibration in hics at intermediate energies </S>",
    "<S> .    figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( e ) and ( f ) present the corresponding rapidity distributions of double neutron to proton ratio `` @xmath32 '' with the same conditions as figs.[fig1 ] ( a ) and ( d ) , respectively . from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( e ) it is seen that the double ratio increases almost linearly from target ( @xmath33 ) to projectile ( @xmath34 ) rapidity region for the case of @xmath35=100 a mev and @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the two curves corresponding to soft and stiff symmetry energies cross at the point of rapidity equal to zero , with positive but different slopes . and obviously , the slope for @xmath15 case is larger than that for @xmath36 case . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that for isospin asymmetric and mass symmetric reactions zr+ru and ru+zr , if the equilibrium with respect to isospin degree of freedom is totally reached , the double ratio should be unity at all rapidities . </S>",
    "<S> the deviation of @xmath37 from unit thus implies the deviation from isospin equilibration . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[fig1 ] ( e ) shows clearly that the isospin equilibration is not reached and the choice of symmetry energy influences the isospin equilibrium process for this case . </S>",
    "<S> while for the reactions at @xmath30 a mev and @xmath23 presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( f ) , the slope is @xmath38 and becomes horizontal in large rapidity region , which means that the isospin equilibration can be roughly reached . </S>",
    "<S> thus the double neutron to proton ratio as function of rapidity taking from the mixing reaction system can provide both the information of density dependence of the symmetry energy and the degree of isospin equilibrium reached in the reaction .    ) ratios with symmetry energies of @xmath15 and @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the zr+ru and ru+zr reactions with @xmath18 a mev , @xmath28 in plot ( a ) , @xmath29 a mev , @xmath28 in ( b ) , @xmath29 a mev , @xmath23 in ( c ) , and @xmath30 a mev , @xmath23 in ( d ) are chosen . </S>",
    "<S> ( e)-(f ) : the corresponding double neutron to proton ratios ( @xmath32 ) for ( a ) and ( d ) cases ( see text ) . , </S>",
    "<S> scaledwidth=80.0% ]    further , we study the beam energy and the centrality dependence of the slope parameters of the double neutron to proton ratio over the rapidity , namely the @xmath39 , which is obtained by linearly fitting the rapidity distribution of the double ratio over @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[fig2 ] ( a ) shows the excitation function of @xmath2 for impact parameters @xmath23 and @xmath4 and for symmetry energies @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively . the reactions with larger impact parameters show larger @xmath2 values , which implies that less equilibration is reached . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 values first rise and then drop slightly with increasing beam energy . </S>",
    "<S> it shows a broad maximum at @xmath41 a mev for intermediate impact parameters , while central collisions peak at @xmath19 a mev . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the symmetry energy on the @xmath39 is stronger for @xmath28 than for @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the isoscalar part of the eos affects the equilibrium process of the colliding system as well @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ( a ) shows @xmath2 at @xmath29 a mev and @xmath28 using a soft eos with momentum dependence ( sm - eos , open dots ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that the difference between the s - eos and the sm - eos is very small . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the effect of the isoscalar part of the eos on @xmath2 is largely cancelled , while the effect of the isovector part on @xmath2 is nicely preserved .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ( a ) also shows that  for central collisions @xmath2 as calculated with a stiff symmetry energy is larger than with a soft one . for @xmath28 , the relative magnitude of @xmath2 as calculated with the stiff symmetry energy becomes smaller than that with the soft symmetry energy . </S>",
    "<S> the centrality dependence ( with @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath4 , and @xmath25 ) of @xmath2 at beam energy @xmath20 a mev is presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that both curves of @xmath2 , as calculated with soft and stiff symmetry energies , increase monotoneously with impact parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 value obtained with the stiff symmetry energy is larger than that with the soft symmetry energy , when @xmath42 . and they reverse when @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the reversal of the relative magnitudes of @xmath39 with stiff or soft symmetry energy at small and large impact parameters is due to the gradual change of the mechanism of particle emission @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> central collisions are more violent , hence the compression is stronger than for the collisions with large impact parameters . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the degree of isospin equilibration is both higher and reached more quickly . </S>",
    "<S> nucleons emitted from central collisions stem mainly from the mid - rapidity region , where matter is much more compressed than at the projectile / target region . during the compression phase </S>",
    "<S> , the stiff symmetry potential provides stronger repulsion ( attraction ) than the soft one for neutrons ( protons ) in the neutron - rich matter . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the center of collisions is more strongly compressed . </S>",
    "<S> however , higher pressure caused by the stiff symmetry potential leads to faster emission of particles . </S>",
    "<S> hence , fewer two - body collisions occur and the equilibration decreases . for peripheral reaction , the average compression is relatively weak , nucleon emission takes place mainly at projectile / target rapidity , where the nuclear density is low . </S>",
    "<S> the low - density nuclear surface thus plays an important role for nucleon emission . at low densities , </S>",
    "<S> the stiff symmetry potential provides weaker repulsion ( attraction ) on neutrons ( protons ) than the soft one in the neutron - rich nuclear medium . </S>",
    "<S> higher densities result in the projectile / target region , leading to an enhanced number of two - body collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the smaller @xmath39 value is evident with the stiff symmetry energy .    </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the symmetry energy on @xmath2 becomes the most pronounced at @xmath3 a mev and at large impact parameters ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> compare the isospin effects in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( b ) and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] for reactions at @xmath44 = 400 a mev and @xmath28 : the double neutron to proton ratio exhibits an enhanced sensitivity ( @xmath45 ) to the density dependence of the symmetry energy as compared to the single neutron to proton ratio ( @xmath46 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the double neutron to proton ratio ( taken from mass symmetric , but isospin asymmetric mixing systems at energies around @xmath20 a mev and at semi - peripheral impact parameters ) is a prominent probe of the density dependence of the symmetry energy .     with symmetry energies with @xmath15 and @xmath16 , for impact parameters @xmath23 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 values at @xmath29 a mev and at @xmath28 with sm - eos are shown with open dots . </S>",
    "<S> ( see text ) ( b ) : the centrality dependence of @xmath2 at @xmath29 a mev.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    in summary , we have investigated the rapidity dependence of the single- and double neutron to proton ratios as taken from isospin - asymmetric but mass - symmetric systems zr+ru and ru+zr . </S>",
    "<S> the beam energy- and the centrality dependence of the slope parameters of the double neutron to proton ratio ( @xmath2 ) as function of rapidity are presented . </S>",
    "<S> we find that both , the rapidity distribution of the single neutron to proton ratio and the @xmath2 are sensitive to the density dependence of symmetry energy . </S>",
    "<S> the study of the beam energy- and the centrality dependence of the @xmath2 values shows that the ( semi- ) peripheral hics at energies around @xmath47 a mev are most suited for probing the density dependence of the symmetry energy . here the symmetry energy effect is enhanced most strongly as is observable in the rapidity dependence of the double neutron to proton ratio , as compared to the single ratio . </S>"
