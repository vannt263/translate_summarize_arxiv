    "studying the @xmath0-boson physics is an important way of testing the standard model ( sm ) and searching for `` new physics '' .",
    "it can be done in both the electron  positron and hadron colliders . in @xmath4 collisions ,",
    "the main source of @xmath0 bosons is the process of @xmath0-pair production .",
    "this process was one of the most important subjects of the lep2 experiments at cern , run in the years 19962000 , see e.g.  refs .",
    "it also belongs to the main topics of a research programme of future linear colliders ( lc ) , see e.g.  ref .",

    "the most precise measurements of the @xmath0-boson mass and width in hadron colliders come from this process , see e.g.  ref .",
    "it can also be used to extract parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and to measure parton luminosities  @xcite .    among radiative corrections that affect",
    "the @xmath0-boson observables considerably is the photon radiation in leptonic @xmath0 decays .",
    "it distorts @xmath0-invariant - mass distributions reconstructed from @xmath0-decay products in @xmath4 experiments  @xcite or @xmath0-transverse - mass distributions obtained in hadron - collider experiments  @xcite .",
    "these distortions are strongly acceptance - dependent , see e.g.  refs .",
    "this radiation also affects lepton pseudorapidity distribution , which is the main tool for the pdfs and parton luminosities measurements in the hadron colliders .",
    "therefore , precise theoretical predictions for the photon radiation in the leptonic @xmath0 decays is of great importance for both types of high - energy particle colliders . in order to be fully applicable in a realistic experimental situation ,",
    "such predictions have to be provided in terms of a monte carlo event generator ( mceg ) .",
    "the  electroweak ( ew ) radiative corrections in the on - shell @xmath0 decays were calculated analytically a long time ago by several authors  @xcite . in the case of the @xmath0-pair production in the @xmath4 colliders , the calculations of the  ew corrections in a double - pole approximation ( dpa ) were done in refs .",

    "therefore , the influence of higher - order radiative corrections on the @xmath0-boson observables was difficult to assess . in this paper , we provide the first calculation of the multiphoton radiation in leptonic @xmath0 decays in the framework of the yennie  frautschi  suura exclusive exponentiation  @xcite .",

    "this evaluation amounts , in practice , to multiplying 2@xmath62 @xmath7-number matrices by 2-dimensional @xmath7-number vectors .",
    "we give below the general spin amplitudes for arbitrary fermions in the initial and in the final states , and apply them later on to the single-@xmath0 production in @xmath8 collisions with leptonic @xmath0 decays .      the born - level feynman diagram for single-@xmath0 production in fermion  antifermion collisions @xmath9 is depicted in fig .",

    "the cross section for drell  yan - like @xmath0 production in hadronic collisions is dominated by the resonant single-@xmath0 process .",

    "the  ew radiative corrections to the resonant single-@xmath0 production and decay can be divided in a gauge - invariant way into the initial - state corrections ( isr ) , initial  final interferences ( non - factorizable corrections ) and the final - state corrections ( fsr ) , see e.g.  refs .",
    "the leading isr ( mass - singular ) qed corrections can be absorbed in the parton distribution functions , in a way similar to the leading qcd corrections  @xcite .",

    "it is known that in processes involving the @xmath0-bosons , the electroweak corrections can not be split in a gauge - invariant way into the pure - qed and pure - weak ones .",

    "the spinorial functions @xmath27 are given explicitly in appendix  a. the qed gauge invariance for these amplitudes means that @xmath61 we have checked numerically that after the replacement @xmath62 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sawd1 ] ) , the values of the spin amplitudes are consistent with zero within the double - precision accuracy .",
    "then , the matrix element for single-@xmath0 production and radiative @xmath0 decay can be obtained through @xmath63 where the lowest - level spin amplitude @xmath64 for the single-@xmath0 production is given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sawp ] ) .",
    "this matrix element is a coherent convolution of non - radiative spin amplitudes for @xmath0 production and radiative spin amplitudes for @xmath0 decay .",

    "this can be achieved by exploiting the partial fraction decomposition of a product of @xmath0-boson propagators arising when photon is emitted from an intermediate @xmath0-boson line  @xcite . this simple decomposition , however , does not work in the running - width scheme . in this case",

    "the two terms in the square brackets correspond to the radiative production and the radiative decay , respectively , but they are multiplied by the factor @xmath69 .",
    "so in the case of the running - width scheme , the partial fraction decomposition of the @xmath0-propagator works modulo this multiplicative factor .",
    "however , including the running @xmath0-boson width in the case of the photon radiation off the @xmath0-line leads to a violation of the qed ward identity , see e.g.  refs .  @xcite . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to restore the respective ward identity it is sufficient to include the light - fermion - loop corrections to the @xmath70 vertex . in the small - fermion - mass approximation this amounts to multiplying the respective radiative amplitude by the factor @xmath71 when we multiply our eq .",
    "( [ eq : pfdwp ] ) by @xmath72 , the factor outside the square brackets on the r.h.s",
    ". drops out , and we obtain the decomposition of the corresponding amplitude into the radiative production and the radiative decay  exactly as in the fixed - width scheme . therefore , our matrix element of eq .",
    "( [ eq : saw1 ] ) for single-@xmath0 production with radiative decays is valid also in the running - width scheme .",
    "let us finally remark that although the compensating factor @xmath72 was derived for the pure light - fermion - loop contribution to the @xmath0-boson width , the respective ward identity is satisfied for any numerical value of @xmath37 .",
    "so , in particular , one may use the radiatively corrected value of the @xmath0-width .",
    "it should also be noted that in order to preserve a gauge - independent definition of the @xmath0-boson mass and width beyond the leading order , one should use , in both the fixed- and running - width schemes , the _ pole _ rather than _ on - shell _ @xmath0 mass and width , see e.g.  refs .",
    "as was mentioned in the introduction , the main purpose of this work is to provide a theoretical prediction for the multiphoton radiation in leptonic @xmath0-boson decays within the yfs exclusive exponentiation scheme . in this paper",

    "the function @xmath84 is the yfs non - ir function corresponding to the single - real - hard photon radiation .",

    "firstly , the respective spin amplitudes are derived without the assumption of the energy - momentum conservation .",
    "therefore , they can be used directly in evaluations of the above yfs @xmath107-functions over the multiphoton phase space , without the need to resort to any `` reduction procedure '' , which reduces the multiphoton phase space to the @xmath108-photon phase space for @xmath95 and the @xmath109-photon phase space for @xmath110 , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "secondly , since the spin amplitudes are obtained for massive fermions , there is no need to use any phase - space slicing or subtraction methods in order to separate mass singularities  @xcite . using spin amplitudes instead of explicit analytical formulae for the squared matrix elements may also be useful for some dedicated studies , such as investigation of various @xmath0-polarization contributions ,",
    "`` new physics '' searches ( spin amplitudes can be easily modified to include some `` new physics '' components ) , etc . and ,",
    "which is important in practice , the numerical evaluation of the matrix elements based on the above spin amplitudes is fast in terms of cpu time .    in computing the matrix element @xmath111 we observed a loss of numerical precision @xmath112   when the angle between the radiative photon and the electron ( positron ) , @xmath113 , was @xmath112  .",
    "it turned out that most of this precision loss was coming from huge numerical cancellations between the terms in the universal eikonal factor of eq .",

    "we could , therefore , perform this cancellation algebraically and thus avoid the above numerical problems .",
    "we , however , keep this term in @xmath111 because apart from the yfs exponentiation we want to have in our program also the non - exponentiated , fixed - order  calculation . since it is now calculated in the same way as the second term in eq .",

    "this is because in this case the large corrections due to lepton - mass - log terms have been excluded by the photon ",
    "lepton recombination .",
    "as can be seen , the largest ( negative ) corrections are in the first radiative bin ( i.e.  the second highest one in the upper plots ) and they change sign for low lepton energies .    in fig .",

    "as can be seen from figs .",
    "[ fig : el][fig : cg ] , the yfs exponentiation affects sizeably radiative events .",
    "all the above distributions have been obtained for the parton - level @xmath0-boson production at fixed cms energy . in the actual proton(anti)proton collisions the parton ",
    "parton cms energy can change , which leads to an enhancement of the fsr corrections , in particular those due to the yfs exponentiation .",

    "we have provided the fully massive spin amplitudes for the single @xmath0-boson production and decay , including the single - real - photon radiation in @xmath0 decays .",
    "we have obtained the numerically stable representations of the yfs form factor for the charged - particle decay .",
    "all this has been applied to the process of drell  yan - like @xmath0-boson production in hadronic collisions and implemented , at the parton level , in the monte carlo event generator winhac  1.0 . for this purpose , an efficient multiphoton mc algorithm has been developed .",
    "the above spin amplitudes have been cross - checked with the independent analytical representations of the appropriate matrix elements  @xcite and they have been found to be in very good numerical agreement .",
    "we have also performed several numerical tests of the implemented mc algorithm .",
    "the results of these tests make us confident in the correctness of this mc algorithm .",
    "numerically , the yfs - exponentiation corrections beyond the fixed   calculations are at the level of @xmath130 for the total cross section , which is the result of the kln - theorem .",
    "however , for some distributions they can amount to between a few and over @xmath142 per cent .",
    "these corrections can be significantly reduced when a calorimetric - like recombination of radiative photons and charged leptons is applied .",
    "such a treatment is experimentally natural for the electrons in the final state , but less obvious for the muons .",
    "here we presented the calculations for the qed - like corrections in the leptonic @xmath0-boson decays and for the parton - level @xmath0-production process only .",
    "we are planning to extend this , in the future , to the full proton(anti)proton collisions and to include other  electroweak corrections .",
    "the next step would be the inclusion of the nlo qcd effects as well as soft - gluon resummation corrections .",
    "we are also going to perform further tests of the program winhac at the  and beyond , particularly comparisons with independent calculations for various observables .",
    "last , but not least , the full documentation of the mc program winhac  @xcite is in preparation ( to be submitted to _ computer physics communications _ ) . there , the details of the corresponding mc algorithm will be given .",
    "in this paper , we applied the qed yfs exponentiation in leptonic @xmath0-boson decays to the single-@xmath0 production process at hadron colliders .",
    "however , it can also be used to describe the photon radiation in @xmath0 decays in the processes of @xmath0-pair production at both hadron and electron  positron colliders . in particular",
