    "phase transition of surfaces has been investigated to understand string models and biological membranes @xcite .",

    "is conventionally called a phantom surface model , which has long been studied numerically on tethered surfaces @xcite and on fluid surfaces @xcite .",
    "recent numerical simulations on phantom hpk models revealed that there is a first - order transition between the smooth phase and the crumpled phase @xcite .",
    "the results in @xcite imply a possible phase transition in biological or artificial membranes , because the hausdorff dimension @xmath8 is @xmath9 in the crumpled phase even though the surface is allowed to self - intersect .",
    "the string tension @xmath4 is a key observable to understand the phase structure of surfaces @xcite .",
    "if a surface becomes oblong , string - like , and of length @xmath1 , the free energy of the surface can be expressed by @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , @xmath4 can be extracted from the grand canonical ensembles of surfaces with fixed boundaries of sufficiently large distance @xmath1 .",
    "it was reported that an extrinsic curvature model undergoes a first - order transition , where the string tension becomes non - zero in the smooth phase close to the transition point in the limit of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the results of the extrinsic curvature model in @xcite show that the order of the transition changes depending on @xmath3 .    however , it is still unknown how the distance @xmath1 between the boundaries influences the phase transition of an intrinsic curvature model on dynamically triangulated surfaces .",

    "however , the string tension was unable to be extracted from the simulations on the tethered surfaces , because the surfaces do not always become string - like even when @xmath3 is relatively large compared to @xmath14 . on the contrary , the fluid surface can be oblong in the limit of @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , we expect that not only the dependence of the transition on the distance @xmath1 but also the string tension @xmath4 is evaluated from the intrinsic curvature models on fluid surfaces with the fixed boundary - vertices .    in this paper , we will study the dependence of the transition on the distance @xmath1 of the boundary of spherical fluid surfaces by mc simulations with dynamical triangulations .",

    "then , we can find the order of the transition precisely by using the finite - size scaling analysis .",
    "we have investigated an intrinsic curvature model on dynamically triangulated spherical surfaces by fixing two vertices as point boundaries separated by the distance @xmath31 .",
    "three different values are assumed for @xmath69 ; @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , where @xmath36 is the radius of a sphere of size @xmath89 and is chosen such that @xmath54 is almost identical to @xmath15 .",
    "the surface size are @xmath57 , @xmath59 , and @xmath0 .",
    "a deficit angle term @xmath18 is assumed for the curvature energy , and the gaussian bond potential @xmath17 is included in the hamiltonian ; @xmath135 , where @xmath2 is the curvature coefficient .",
    "the model is expected to have the smooth phase at sufficiently large @xmath2 on dynamically triangulated surfaces .",
    "it is also expected that the smooth phase is separated from a non - smooth phase by the first - order transition , where the surface is almost linear and is very similar to the branched polymer surface @xcite .",
    "we also confirmed in @xcite that the order of the transition changes from first - order to second - order on tethered surfaces as the distance @xmath69 increases .",
    "therefore , we aimed in this paper to see how the transition changes depending on @xmath69 on dynamically triangulated fluid surfaces , where the surfaces are expected to be oblong at sufficiently large @xmath69 .",
    "it was confirmed in this paper that the first - order transition remains unchanged and is not influenced by how large @xmath69 is , up to @xmath64 at least . in the crumpled phase , the surface spans from one boundary point to the other as an oblong and almost linear surface under the conditions @xmath136 . on the other hand",
    ", there appears a spherical lump on the surface between the two boundaries in the smooth phase .",
    "almost all vertices are included in the lump , and therefore physical quantities , such as the bending energy @xmath114 , change depending on whether the lump is included in the surface or not .",
    "a discontinuous change of @xmath110 , which is not included in the hamiltonian , characterizes the first - order transition .",
    "the deficit angle term in the hamiltonian also changes discontinuously at the transition point .",
    "the string tension @xmath4 was obtained when @xmath63 and @xmath64 , where the surface is sufficiently oblong even in the smooth phase though the lump is included in the surface .",
    "we found that @xmath4 has a jump at the transition point , and that @xmath4 takes a constant value in the smooth phase in the sense that it is independent of the distance @xmath69 . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath4 increases with increasing @xmath69 in the crumpled phase .",
    "the scaling property @xmath137 was also obtained at the smooth phase and at the crumpled phase close to the transition point .",
    "we have @xmath138 in the smooth phase , and @xmath139 in the crumpled phase .",
    "thus , the crumpled phase is characterized by vanishing string tension ; @xmath4 decreases with decreasing @xmath123 ( increasing @xmath89 under fixed @xmath131 ) or equivalently @xmath4 increases with increasing @xmath3 under fixed @xmath89 in the crumpled phase .",
    "this describes the above mentioned dependence of @xmath4 on @xmath69 in the crumpled phase .",
    "it is interesting to calculate @xmath4 in the extrinsic curvature model on relatively large fluid surfaces .",
    "the shape of surfaces of the extrinsic curvature model @xcite seems very different from those of the intrinsic curvature model , and the dependence of the transition on @xmath3 is also different from each other ; the transition strengthens ( remains unchanged ) as @xmath3 increases in the extrinsic ( intrinsic ) curvature model .",
    "moreover , the dependence of @xmath4 on the curvature coefficient in both models is almost identical with each other ; @xmath4 has a jump at the transition point under sufficiently large @xmath3 in both models .",
