    "lvy flights are random processes based on lvy stable distributions@xcite .",
    "they have been utilized successfully in modeling various complex spatio - temporal behavior of non - equilibrium dissipative systems such as fluid turbulence , anomalous diffusion , and financial markets@xcite .",
    "the lvy stable distribution is self - similar to its convolutions .",
    "it has a long power - law tail that decays much more slowly compared with an exponential decay , which gives rise to infinite variance .",
    "however , in practical situations , it is usually truncated due to nonlinearity or finiteness of the system . in order to incorporate this fact , mantegna and",
    "stanley@xcite introduced the notion of truncated lvy flight .",
    "it is based on a truncated lvy stable distribution with a sharp cut - off in its power - law tail . therefore , the distribution is not self - similar when convoluted , and has finite variance .",
    "thus , the truncated lvy flight converges to a gaussian process due to the central limit theorem in contrast to the ordinary lvy stable process .",
    "however , as they pointed out , its convergence to a gaussian is very slow and the process exhibits anomalous behavior in a wide range before the convergence . koponen@xcite reproduced their result analytically using a different type of truncated lvy distribution with a smoother cut - off .",
    "dubrulle and laval@xcite applied their idea to the velocity field of 2d fluid turbulence , and claimed that the truncation is essential for the multi - scaling property of the velocity field to appear .",
    "they showed that the broken self - similarity of the distribution makes a qualitative difference on the scaling property of the corresponding random process , i.e. , the ordinary lvy stable process exhibits mere single - scaling , while the truncated lvy process exhibits multi - scaling , although their analysis was mostly based on numerical calculation and the obtained scaling exponents were rather inaccurate .",
    "the idea of truncated lvy flights has also been applied to the analysis of financial data such as stock market prices and foreign exchange rates@xcite .",
    "multi - scaling analyses of the financial data have also been attempted@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we treat the truncated lvy flights analytically based on the smooth truncation introduced by koponen , and clarify their multi - scaling properties .",
    "they exhibit the simplest form of multi - scaling , i.e. , bi - fractality , due to the characteristic shape of the truncated lvy distribution .",

    "therefore , it is expected that the moment whose degree @xmath74 is lower than @xmath92 is almost the same as that obtained from the ordinary lvy stable distribution , and the moment for @xmath93 is mostly determined by the asymptotic tail of the truncated lvy distribution . note that the moment for @xmath93 does not exist for the ordinary lvy stable distribution .",

    "as we mentioned previously , the cut - off parameter @xmath46 may represent the finiteness of the system under consideration",
    ". then it would be natural to assume @xmath46 as a decreasing function of the system size @xmath104 , for example @xmath105 , and we can think of the system - size dependence of the truncated lvy flight .",

    "] however , approximate finite - size scaling relations still hold separately , if we divide @xmath106 into two parts at the power - law decaying part , i.e. , into the self - similar part and the tail part .",
    "as we explained , the self - similar part is insensitive to @xmath108 , and @xmath106 for different system sizes collapse to a single curve in this region without rescaling . on the other hand ,",
    "the tail part is asymptotically given by @xmath109 , which can be rescaled as @xmath110 to give a universal curve .",
    "thus , we have two different approximate finite - size scaling relations in different regions of @xmath14 , which is separated by the power - law decaying part .",
    "of course , this is closely related to the bi - fractal behavior of the scaling exponents .",
    "similar asymptotic finite - size scaling is also reported in the sandpile models of self - organized criticality@xcite .",
    "recently , chechkin and gonchar@xcite discussed the finite sample number effect on the scaling properties of a stable lvy process .",
    "( they treated only the symmetric case using a different argument from ours , which was more qualitative and therefore more general in a sense . )",
    "they claimed that , due to the finite sample number effect , `` spurious '' multi - affinity is observed in the numerical simulation and derived the `` spurious '' multi - scaling exponent .",
    "interestingly , or in some sense obviously , their `` spurious '' multi - scaling exponent is the same as our multi - scaling exponent , since the truncation of the power - law by @xmath46 can also be interpreted as mimicking the finite sample number effect of experiments .",
    "our calculation presented in this paper is similar to our previous work@xcite on the multi - scaling properties of the amplitude and difference fields of anomalous spatio - temporal chaos found in systems of non - locally coupled oscillators .",
    "the distribution treated there was not the truncated lvy type but had a form like @xmath111 .",
    "since this form is easily generated by a simple multiplicative stochastic process , some attempts have been made to model the economic activity using this type of distribution@xcite .",
    "the bi - fractal behavior of the scaling exponent is the simplest case of multi - scaling , while experimentally observed scaling exponents usually exhibit more complex behavior .",
    "actually , it has long been discussed in the context of fluid turbulence what the shape of the distribution should be to reproduce the experimentally observed scaling exponent@xcite . in order to reproduce the behavior of the scaling exponent more realistically in the framework of the truncated lvy flights discussed here , introduction of correlations to the random variables",
