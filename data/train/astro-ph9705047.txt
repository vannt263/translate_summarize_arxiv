    "within the last year ionized gas kinematics has revealed in a number of edge - on disk galaxies double - peaked emission lines .",
    "the analysis of the line profiles allows to derive individual rotation curves characteristic of two kinematically distinct gas components .",
    "the edge - on s0 galaxy ngc  7332 has been found to have an `` x - shaped '' velocity curve , indicating two gas components counterrotating one with respect to the other ( plana & boulesteix 1996 ) .",
    "+ in the inner regions of the sc ngc  5907 miller & rubin ( 1995 ) observed double - valued ionized gas emissions .",
    "they attributed the higher velocity system to disk gas near the nucleus , and the lower velocity system to an outer gas ring .",
    "although these two gas components are supposed to be spatially distinct , they are viewed superimposed along the line - of - sight on account of ngc  5907 high inclination .",
    "+ the spirals ngc  5746 ( kuijken & merrifield 1995 ; bureau & freeman 1996 ) , ngc  5965 ( kuijken & merrifield 1995 ) , ic  5096 ( bureau & freeman 1996 ) and ngc  2683 ( merrifield 1996 ) have boxy / peanut bulges and double - peaked gas line profiles .",
    "kuijken & merrifield ( 1995 ) explained these features as the signature of a disk non - axisymmetric potential due to the presence of a bar .    in this paper",
    "we show yet an other case of edge - on disk galaxy with a multiple - valued gas velocity curve , namely ugc  10205 . for projected distances",
    "lower than 13  from the nucleus ugc  10205 it is characterized by the presence of three kinematically distinct gaseous components , two of which give to its velocity curve a `` figure - of - eight '' appearance . + ugc  10205 is classified as sa spiral by nilson ( 1973 ) and by de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "its total @xmath1-band magnitude is @xmath2 mag ( rc3 ) and the inclination of the galaxy deduced from the disk parameters is @xmath3 ( rubin et al . 1985 ) .",
    "the distance is 132 mpc ( @xmath4  mpc@xmath5 ) .",
    "the spectroscopic observations of ugc  10205 were carried out on march 19 - 21 , 1996 at the isaac newton telescope ( int ) in la palma using the intermediate dispersion spectrograph ( ids ) .",
    "the h1800v grating with 1800 grooves@xmath6 was used in the first order in combination with a 1.9  @xmath7 4.0  slit , the 500  mm camera and the agred collimator .",
    "it yielded a wavelength coverage of @xmath8 between 6650    and 6890    with a reciprocal dispersion of 9.92  @xmath9 .",
    "we checked that the measured fwhms do not depend on wavelength and we found a mean value of fwhm = 0.86  (i.e .",
    "@xmath10   ) that , in the range of the observed gas emission lines , corresponds to @xmath11  .",

    "we took two separate major axis spectra ( p.a .",
    "= 132@xmath13 ) for a total exposure time of 100 minutes ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the slit was centered visually on the galaxy nucleus .",
    "a comparison copper - argon lamp exposure was obtained between the two object integrations .",
    "all the images were reduced using standard midas routines . considering a sample of 8 bright oh night - sky emission lines",
    ", we found a mean deviation from the theorical predicted wavelength ( osterbrock & martel , 1992 ) corresponding to @xmath14  .",
    "the gas velocities and velocity dispersions for @xmath15 , where the ionized gas emission lines have a gaussian profile shape , were derived by means of the midas package alice .",
    "we measured the  and the ( @xmath16  ) lines , where they were clearly detected .",
    "the position , the fwhm and the uncalibrated flux of each emission line were individually determined by interactively fitting one gaussian plus a polynomial to each emission and to its surrounding continuum .",
    "the wavelength of the gaussian center was converted to the velocity @xmath17 , and then an heliocentric correction of @xmath18  was applied .",
    "the gaussian fwhm was corrected for the instrumental fwhm and then converted to the velocity dispersion @xmath19 .",
    "the ionized gas emission lines are double - peaked for @xmath20@xmath21 3  and even triple - peaked for 3  @xmath22 .",
    "they have been fitted using the above package with two or three gaussians respectively and a polynomial continuum . at each radius",

    "the observed gas kinematics extends out to 42  ( @xmath25  kpc ) in the receding nw side and about up to 30  ( @xmath26  kpc ) in the se approaching side respectively .    for @xmath27  ( @xmath28 kpc )",
    "we are able to disentangle ( fig .  1 and fig .  2 ) three kinematically distinct gaseous components , named as fast - rotating ( i ) , slow - rotating ( ii ) and third ( iii ) .",
    "+ the fast - rotating gas component ( i ) shows a velocity curve with a very steep gradient , reaching an observed maximum rotation of 240  at @xmath29  ( @xmath30  kpc ) from the center and remaining almost constant for @xmath31 .",
    "its velocity dispersion has a central peak of about 90  and it shows a sharp decrease to values lower than 25  outwards .",
    "the radial velocity of the slow - rotating gas component ( ii ) increases linearly with the distance from the galaxy center reaching 240  at @xmath32  ( @xmath33  kpc ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion remains between 40  and 50  .",
    "this range is larger in the  line , which however is characterized by a lower signal - to - noise ratio . in the radial range between @xmath34  and @xmath35  along the se side of the major axis",
    "the  and  emissions have triple - peaked lines . indeed in this region the component ( iii ) is observed .",
    "it has a radial velocity increasing linearly from @xmath36  to @xmath37   and equal to the systemic velocity at @xmath38  ( @xmath39 kpc ) .",
    "it has a quite low velocity dispersion of @xmath40 .",
    "+ for @xmath15  a single - valued velocity curve is measured , showing the tendency to flatten out .",
    "the velocity dispersions in this radial range are lower than 30  .    adopting the center of symmetry of velocities for @xmath27as the systemic heliocentric velocity , we derived @xmath41  in agreement with @xmath42  found by rubin et al .",
    "( 1985 ) .    studying the ionized gas velocity curves of a sample of sa spirals ,",
    "also rubin et al .",
    "( 1985 ) noticed along the se side of the ugc  10205 major axis `` a curious three - velocity system '' within 10 kpc of the center .",
    "it can not be reconciled with our component ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iii ) . the reciprocal dispersion ( 25 @xmath9 ) and the spatial scale ( 25  mm@xmath5 ) of their image - tube spectrum were respectively 3 and 2 times lower than those of our ccd spectrum .",
    "so they did not disentangle the component ( i ) from the ( ii ) , detecting them as a unique one .",
    "they observed a second velocity system , corresponding to velocity curve of component ( iii ) .",
    "finally , for two distinct radii at @xmath43  they measured intermediate velocities between those of the first and the second system and considered them as related to a third velocity component .",
    "in the inner @xmath0  ugc  10205 we are facing two main kinematically distinct gaseous components , namely ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "they have quite similar velocity dispersion profiles but very different velocity curves , which produce the `` figure - of - eight '' appearance of ugc  10205 velocity curve .",
    "the simultaneous presence of the two gas components at the same distance of the galaxy center raises the problem of the viscous interaction of distinct gaseous structures with different kinematical characteristics .",
    "one possibility is the gas to be distributed in collisionless cloudlets , as suggested by cinzano & van der marel ( 1994 ) to explain the ionized gas kinematics in the e4 ngc  2974 .",
    "if this is the case , we would expect the slow - rotating component being supported by a velocity dispersion higher than that we observed .",
    "we are left with the interpretation already given by miller & rubin ( 1995 ) for ngc  5907 and by kuijken & merrifield ( 1995 ) for ngc  5746 and ngc  5965 that the two gas components are spatially distinct and viewed superimposed along the line - of - sight due to the high inclination of the galaxy .",
    "the linear rise of the velocity curve of component ( ii ) up to the points of conjunction with those of component ( i ) is due to the so - called `` rim of the wheel '' effect when viewing at an enhanced ring structure .",
    "moreover , the radial trend of line intensity derived for the two components seem to confirm this interpretation .",
    "indeed , the intensity of component ( i ) is peaked in the center , while the intensity of component ( ii ) is almost constant as we are expecting if component ( ii ) is actually an outer ring .",
    "the above gas configuration is the one expected in a barred galaxy . indeed",
    "the bar exerts a torque on the disk gas , which is slowly drifted from the regions around the corotation radius towards the lindblad resonances to form rings .",
    "kuijken & merrifield ( 1995 ) and merrifield ( 1996 ) showed the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) in function of the projected radius for the closed non - intersecting orbits allowed by a barred disk potential in edge - on galaxies .",
    "( due to its collisional nature , the gas moves only onto the closed non - intersecting orbits . )",
    "they found the losvds with the characteristic `` figure - of - eight '' variation with radius .",
    "for this reason they considered the gaps in such losvds as the signature of the presence in the disk of the gas - depleted regions due to the bar .",
    "the gas components ( ii ) in the velocity curve of ugc  10205 is produced by the ring formed at the outer lindblad resonance .",
    "the third gas component observed in the inner regions of ugc  10205 is very peculiar .",
    "it is present only on the se side and it has a velocity ranging from @xmath44  to @xmath45  if reported to the systemic velocity of the galaxy .",
    "so it is not moving around the galaxy center in circular orbits .",
    "it could be associated to the faint features embedding ugc  10205 and visible in the @xmath46-band images shown by rubin ( 1987 ) . its kinematics can be explained if such gas moves onto an elliptical orbit , which at the projected distance of @xmath47  has its tangent perpendicular to the line - of - sight .",
    "the gas of component ( iii ) populates only a portion of this orbit . from the available data we can not infer the proper distance of component ( iii ) from the galaxy center .",
    "outside 13  we observe single - peaked emission lines produced by disk gas in near - circular motion . for radial distances greater than that of the outer lindblad resonance",
    "we expect the gas to be only little disturbed by the inner triaxial potential .",
    "because of the edge - on orientation of the disk with respect to the line - of - sight , if the gas is distributed uniformly decreasing throughout the disk we would expect to observe emission lines peaked at the local circular velocity with an asymmetry towards the lower velocities .",
    "this emission feature is present in ugc 10205 in the form of very low luminous intensity .",
    "it is superimposed to a major emission that does not show any systematic deviation from the gaussian shape .",
    "irregularities in the velocity curve can be easily produced by the fact of the integration along the line - of - sight being the galaxy seen on edge .",
    "the interpretation of kuijken & merrifield ( 1995 ) has been recently adopted by merrifield ( 1996 ) for ngc  2683 observed by rubin , and by bureau & freeman ( 1996 ) for ic  5096 .",
    "it could also be applied not only to ugc  10205 but also to the case ngc  5907 , extending the explanation given by miller & rubin ( 1995 ) .",
    "since their two spirals have peanut - shaped bulges , merrifield and kuijken ( 1995 ) suggested a connection between the peanut bulges , which are detectable only in edge - on galaxies , and the bars , which are easily detectable in more face - on systems .",
    "anyway , while ngc  2683 , ngc  5746 , ngc  5965 and ic  5096 have boxy / peanut - shape bulges , for ngc  5907 and ugc  10205 this crucial photometric information is still not available .",
    "the presence of the `` figure - of - eight '' in gas velocity curves of edge - on spirals seems to be unrelated to the morphological type in the spiral sequence since in rc3 ugc  10205 is classified sa , ngc  2683 , ngc  5746 and ngc  5965 are sb , ic  5096 is sbc , and ngc  5907 is sc .",
    "the geometrical distribution of the gas giving rise to the `` figure - of - eight '' velocity curves could be used in the interpretation of phenomena like the one described by plana & boulesteix ( 1996 ) in the s0 ngc  7332 .",
    "it is an edge - on galaxy with a boxy - shaped bulge ( fisher & illinghworth 1994 ) .",
    "plana & boulesteix ( 1996 ) separated clearly two extended coplanar counterrotating components of ionized gas , which were previously detected by fisher & illinghworth ( 1994 ) .",
    "one of these components has a linearly increasing velocity curve ( `` rim of the wheel '' effect ) .",
    "if we imagine to invert the sense of rotation of this latter component , a typical `` figure - of - eight '' velocity curve is obtained .",
    "therefore a gas distribution like that of the above - mentioned edge - on barred spirals but with an outer ring counterrotating with respect to the inner gas could reproduce the kinematics of ngc  7332 , for which a satisfactory interpretation has been not given .",
    "of course , theoretical modelling should justify this situation .",
