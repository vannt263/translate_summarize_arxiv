    "the klein tunneling@xcite is one of the most important manifestations of the relativistic dirac spectrum in graphene @xcite . in this process",
    "an electron crosses a gap between two bands , which is a classically forbidden area , transforming from an electron to a hole , or vise versa .",
    "the klein tunneling was well known in the theory of narrow - gap semiconductors under the name of interband or landau - zener tunneling . in the framework of the band theory the electron wave function for the states close to a narrow gap between two broad bands must satisfy the dirac - like equation@xcite .",
    "this can be demonstrated within the model of nearly free electrons@xcite .",
    "so the analogy with the relativistic electrodynamics was well known and exploited in the theory of semiconductors .",
    "for example , aronov and pikus@xcite used the pseudo - lorentz transformation ( with the fermi velocity playing the role of the light speed ) treating the effect of the magnetic field on the interband ( klein - landau - zener ) tunneling .",
    "this method was used by shytov _",
    "@xcite for graphene .",
    "one may expect to reveal evidence of the klein tunneling from observations of charge transport and shot noise in a graphene sheet in the ballistic regime , which are now intensively studied experimentally@xcite . analyzing conductance and shot noise in a ballistic graphene sheet a commonly accepted assumption was that under electrodes the graphene is strongly doped .",
    "a further assumption , which simplified a theoretical analysis , was that the level of doping changed abruptly .",
    "this led to a rectangular potential barrier for electrons in a graphene sheet@xcite .",
    "one may expect that in reality the doping level should vary continuously .",
    "smooth finite - slope potential steps were analyzed theoretically for @xmath0 transitions in graphene@xcite . a possible model for the potential barrier might be a trapezoid shown in fig .",
    "recently experimental investigations of transport through tunable potential barriers were reported@xcite , which focused on observed asymmetry of the dependence of resistance on gate voltage with respect to the sign of voltage measured from the electrostatic potential of the dirac point in the sheet center .",
    "in the diffusive regime asymmetry was attributed to scattering by charged impurities@xcite . in the ballistic regime asymmetry",
    "is related with the klein tunneling@xcite .",
    "qualitatively the origin of asymmetry in the ballistic regime is illustrated in fig .",
    "we consider the limit of a small voltage bias , i.e. , a difference of electrochemical potentials in leads is very small",
    ". then only the states near the fermi level contribute to the conductance .",
    "the small voltage bias drives electrons to the left and holes to the right .",
    "if the gate voltage @xmath1 is positive ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) , the fermi level crosses only the conductance band of electrons .",
    "there is no classically forbidden zone for electrons moving above the barrier , and the transmission of the sheet is restricted only by the over - barrier reflection . on the other hand , if the gate voltage @xmath1 is negative ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) , the fermi level crosses the conductance band in the electrodes and the valence band in the sheet .",
    "the sheet is classically forbidden for electrons , and the charge transport is realized via holes , which annihilate with electrons moving from the left to the area of the slope of the width @xmath2 .",
    "this is the process of the klein tunneling . in the limit of a very steep slope ( rectangular barrier ) the probability of over - barrier reflection",
    "exactly coincides with the reflection from the band boundary@xcite . in general",
    "these probabilities are different : the probability of over - barrier reflection decreases with the growth of positive @xmath1 , while at large negative @xmath1 the klein tunneling essentially restricts transmission and reflection probability remains finite .",
    "therefore experimental detection of asymmetry provides evidence of the klein tunneling@xcite .",
    "shifts the fermi level up to the conductance band .",
    "the electron at the fermi level is crossing the sheet from left to right without leaving the conductance band .",
    "( b ) a negative gate voltage @xmath1 shifts the fermi level down to the valence band .",
    "the electron crossing the sheet must tunnel from the conductance to the valence band on the left ( inside the circle ) and tunnel back to the conductance band on the right . reflected waves are not shown . ]    for studying transport through the trapezoid barrier one should find the electron wave function inside the slope areas of the width @xmath2 , where the electron is subject to a uniform electric field .",
    "the dirac equation in a uniform electric field has an exact solution in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions , which was found long time ago by sauter@xcite .",
    "he used it calculating the probability of the klein tunneling .",
    "kane and blount@xcite gave an exact solution of the dirac equation in terms of weber parabolic cylinder functions , which are directly connected with the confluent hypergeometric functions@xcite used by sauter@xcite .",

    "<S> the conductance and the fano factor in a graphene sheet in the ballistic regime are calculated . </S>",
    "<S> the electrostatic potential in the sheet is modeled by a trapezoid barrier , which allows to use the exact solution of the dirac equation in a uniform electric field in the slope areas ( the two lateral sides of the trapezoid ) . </S>",
    "<S> a special attention is devoted to asymmetry with respect to the sign of the gate voltage , which is connected with the difference between the klein tunneling and the over - barrier reflection . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of the developed theory with the experiment supports the conclusion that the klein tunneling was revealed experimentally . </S>"
