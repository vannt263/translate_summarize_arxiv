    "we now specify the temperature regime where our sequential tunneling picture holds.@xcite a higher limit is set by the condition @xmath138 , necessary to have a well - defined number of qp in the antidot against thermal fluctuations .",

    "the model of a finite size chiral luttinger liquid with periodic boundary conditions has been reviewed and cast in a suitable form for calculations of higher current moments through a master equation approach in the sequential regime .",

    "a quantitative determination of @xmath0 is furthermore possible through the power - law behaviour of on - resonance current versus voltage at low temperatures .",

    "we have identified _ special _ regimes in the one- and two - state regions where a comparison of fano factor and normalized skewness realizes an unambiguous charge determination procedure , insensitive to renormalizations of @xmath0 .",
    "finally , signatures of plasmonic excitations are indicated in the large bias voltage regime .",
    "confirmation of such novel results appears to be within reach : plugging estimated parameters from present experiments@xcite into our results gives currents in the range of @xmath289 pa for @xmath84 and @xmath290 mk . at the same time , recent accomplishments in measurement techniques applied to electron counting open the possibility for feasible noise and skewness determination , even in systems with very low current and noise levels.@xcite    furthermore , litographic approaches have been developed that allow for antidot radii sensibly smaller than the 300 nm in the original experiments.@xcite thus , the energy scale @xmath154 associated with the antidot finite size can be raised to the order of some hundreds of mk , and more easily attainable temperature regimes can be compatible with the requirements of our approximations .",
    "we believe that our results help clarify some issues related to transport in the hall regime , namely features like fractional charges and nonpoissonian correlations .",
