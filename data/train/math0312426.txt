    "the benefit of this result is that since the moduli space of gauge equivalence classes of flat @xmath3-connections on an orientable surface is khler , the fixed point set of this involution , which is an anti - symplectic , anti - holomorphic isometry , is a totally geodesic lagrangian submanifold of the khler manifold .",
    "we constructed a model similar to the standard model used to identify the moduli space of flat @xmath3-connections on a surface with the space of representations from the fundamental group of the surface into @xmath3 , divided by the conjugate action ( for example:@xcite ) by introducing two base points on the surface instead of one base point .",

    "our main result is , ( note that the smooth part of the moduli space is an open dense subset )    let @xmath5 be a compact , closed nonorientable surface and @xmath6 its orientable double cover .",
