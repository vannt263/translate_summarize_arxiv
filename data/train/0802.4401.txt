    "braneworld model has received renewed interest in recent years . by this scenario our world",
    "is represented by a four dimensional sub - manifold , a three - brane , embedded in a higher dimensional spacetime @xcite .",
    "the idea that our universe may have more than four dimensions was proposed by kaluza @xcite , with the objective to unify gauge theories with gravitation in a geometric formalism .",
    "of particular interest are the models introduced by randall and sundrum @xcite .",
    "the corresponding spacetime contains two ( rsi ) , respectively one ( rsii ) , ricci - flat brane(s ) embedded on a five - dimensional anti - de sitter ( ads ) bulk .",
    "it is assumed that all matter fields are confined on the branes and gravity only propagates in the five dimensional bulk . in the rsi model , the hierarchy problem between the planck scale and the electroweak one is solved if the distance between the two branes is about @xmath6 times the ads radius .",
    "although topological defects have been first analysed in four - dimensional spacetime @xcite , they have been considered in the context of braneworld . in this scenario",
    "the defects live in a @xmath7dimensions submanifold embedded in a @xmath8dimensional universe .",
    "the domain wall case , with a single extra dimension , has been considered in @xcite .",
    "more recently the cosmic string case , with two additional extra dimensions , has been analysed @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the gravitational effects of global strings can be responsible for compactification from six to four spacetime dimensions , naturally producing the observed hierarchy between electroweak and gravitational forces .",
    "cosmic strings are topologically stable gravitational defects which appear in the framework of grand unified theories .",
    "these objects could be produced in very early universe as a result of spontaneous breakdown of gauge symmetry @xcite . although the recent observation data on the cosmic microwave background have ruled out cosmic strings as the primary source for primordial density perturbation , they are still candidate for the generation of a number of interesting physical effects such as gamma ray burst @xcite , gravitational waves @xcite and high energy cosmic ray @xcite . recently ,",
    "cosmic strings have attracted renewed interest partly because a variant of their formation mechanism is proposed in the framework of brane inflation @xcite-@xcite .    the simplest theoretical model describing an idealized cosmic string , i.e. , straight and infinitely thin , is given by a delta - type distribution for the energy - momentum tensor along the linear defect . as the solution of the einstein equation",
    ", the geometry of the space - time produced by this source presents a conical singularity for the curvature tensor on its top . under classical field theory viewpoint",
    ", this object can also be formed coupling the energy - momentum tensor associated with the higgs @xmath9gauge system investigated by nielsen and olesen @xcite with the einstein equations .",
    "this project was successfully analysed by garfinkle @xcite .",
    "he found static cylindrically symmetric solutions representing vortices , as in flat space - time , and shown that asymptotically the space - time around the vortices is a minkowski one minus a wedge .",
    "their core have a non - zero thickness , and the magnetic fields vanishes outside them .",
    "two years later linet @xcite obtained , as a limit case , exact solutions for the metric tensor and higgs field .",
    "he was able to show that the structure of the respective space - time corresponds to a conical one , with the conicity parameter being expressed in terms of the energy per unity length of the vortex .",
    "the vacuum polarization effects associated with scalar and fermionic fields in the space - time of an idealized cosmic string , have been analyzed in @xcite-@xcite , and @xcite-@xcite , respectively .",
    "it has been shown that these effects depend on the parameter which codify the conical structure of the geometry . moreover , considering the presence of magnetic flux along the cosmic strings , there appears an additional contributions to the vacuum polarization effect associated with charged fields @xcite-@xcite .",
    "another type of vacuum polarization takes place when boundaries are presents .",
    "the imposed boundary conditions on quantum fields modifies the zero - point energy fluctuations spectrum and result in additional shifts in the vacuum expectation values of physical quantities , such as energy density and stress .",
    "this is the well - known casimir effects .",
    "the analysis of casimir effects in the idealized cosmic string space - time have been developed for a scalar @xcite and vector fields @xcite , obeying boundary conditions on the cylindrical surfaces .",
    "the investigation of quantum effects in corresponding braneworld models is of considerable phenomenological interest , both in particle physics and cosmology .",
    "quantum effects provide natural alternative for stabilizing the radion fields in a braneworld .",
    "the corresponding vacuum energy gives contribution to both the brane and bulk cosmological constant and , hence , has to be taking into account in the self - consistent formulation of the braneworld dynamics .",
    "recently the fluxes by gauge fields play an important role in higher dimensional models including braneworld scenario ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "they provide stabilization mechanism for all moduli fields appearing , in particular , in various string compactifications .",
    "motivated by these facts , we decided to analyse the vacuum polarization effects associated with a charged spin@xmath10 field in a higher - dimensional cosmic string space - time considering an infinitely thin magnetic flux running along it .",
    "specifically we are interested to calculate the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "although , as we shall see , for a @xmath0dimensional cosmic string space - time , the renormalized vev of the energy - momentum tensor associated with massless quantum fields presents the general form below @xmath11 being @xmath12 the azimuthal distance to the string , the components of the tensor @xmath13 have different expressions depending on the dimension of the manifold .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec2 ] we present a general expression for a charged massless spin@xmath10 green function valid for an arbitrary @xmath14dimensional cosmic string space - time , @xmath15 .",
    "although our main objective is to investigate the vacuum polarization effects in a six - dimensional spaces , the green function obtained allows us to develop this analysis for lower dimensions as well .",
    "moreover , in this section we also present a general expression for green function associated with massive field for a particular choice of the parameters which codify the presence of cosmic string , and the fractional part of the ratio of the magnetic flux by the quantum one . in this way , the massive fermionic green function is expressed in terms of a finite sum of modified bessel function @xmath16 , allowing us to present the renormalized vev of the energy - momentum tensor in a closed form . in the section [ sec3 ]",
    "we investigate the spinor green functions in coincidence limit and extract all divergences in manifest form . using this result",
    ", we provide explicit expressions for all components of the renormalized vev of the energy - momentum tensor for different dimensions of the space , and for massless and massive fields . in section [ conc ] , we summarize the most important results obtained . in appendix [ app ]",
    "we present a generalization of the generation function for the modified bessel functions , needed to construct the fermionic green function as a finite sum of images of the minkowski space - time functions .",
    "the appendix [ app1 ] contains some technical formulas related with the calculation of the renormalized vev of the energy - momentum tensor in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "this section is mainly devoted to calculate the feynman propagator associated with a charged fermionic field propagating in a @xmath0dimensional cosmic string space - time whose geometry is given by the line element @xmath17 specifically for a six - dimensional space , the coordinate system reads : @xmath18 , with @xmath19 , @xmath20 $ ] , and @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 is parameter smaller than unity associated with the linear mass density of the string . in the braneworld scenario",
    "the space - time given by ( [ cs0 ] ) , the bulk , represents a conical @xmath24brane transverse to a two flat space .    in order to develop the calculation of the spinor green function we shall adopt the @xmath25 dirac matrices @xmath26 given below , which can be constructed in terms of the @xmath27 ones @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 represents the @xmath27 identity matrix and @xmath31 and @xmath32 stand the ordinary unit vectors in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "this set of matrices satisfies the clifford algebra @xmath33 .    in the analysis of the vacuum polarization effects",
    ", we also consider the presence of an extra magnetic field running along the string .",
    "this magnetic field configuration is given by the following six - vector potential @xmath34 being @xmath35 .",
    "the spinor feynman propagator , defined as @xcite @xmath36 with @xmath37 , satisfies the non - homogeneous linear differential equation , @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "the covariant derivative operator reads @xmath40 being @xmath41 the the spin connection given in terms of the @xmath42matrices by @xmath43 and @xmath44 the green function given in ( [ feyn ] ) is a bispinor , i.e. , it transforms as @xmath45 at @xmath46 and as @xmath47 at @xmath48 .    in @xcite",
    "we have shown that if a bispinor , @xmath49 , satisfies the differential equation @xmath50{\\cal{d}}_f(x , x')&=&-\\frac1{\\sqrt{-g}}\\delta^6(x - x')i_{(8 ) } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath51 \\ , \\ d_m=\\nabla_m - iea_m \\ , \\ ] ] @xmath52 being the scalar curvature and the generalized dalembertian operator given by @xmath53 then the spinor feynman propagator may be written as @xmath54    applying this formalism for the system under investigation the operator @xmath55 , which acts on the left hand side of ( [ d ] ) , reads @xmath56 where @xmath57 and . ]",
    "@xmath58    due to the fact of @xmath59 be a diagonal matrix , the bispinor @xmath49 is diagonal , too . in this way",
    "we can obtain an expression for this green function analyzing only the effective @xmath60 matrix differential equation below : @xmath61{\\cal{d}}^{(2)}_f(x , x')= -\\frac1{\\sqrt{-g}}\\delta^6(x - x')i_{(2 ) } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so the complete green function is given in terms of @xmath62 , in a diagonal matrix form .",
    "on basis of these results , for this six - dimensional cosmic string space - time , the fermionic propagator reads : @xmath63d_f(x , x ' ) \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the vacuum average value for the energy - momentum tensor can be expressed in terms of the euclidean green function .",
    "it is related with the ordinary feynman green function @xcite by the relation @xmath64 , where @xmath65 . in the following",
    "we shall consider the euclidean green function .    in order to obtain the euclidean green function @xmath66 in explicit form ,",
    "let us find the complete set of bispinor which obey the eigenvalue equation @xmath67 with @xmath68 and being @xmath69 the euclidean version of the differential operator given in ( [ k ] ) .",
    "so we may write @xmath70 the eigenfunctions of ( [ k1 ] ) can be specified by a set of quantum number associated with operators that commute with @xmath69 and among themselves : @xmath71 , @xmath72 for @xmath73 , @xmath74 and the spin operator , @xmath75 .",
    "let us denote these quantum numbers by @xmath76 , where @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "moreover , these functions also depend on the number @xmath80 , which satisfies the relation @xmath81 and assumes values in the interval @xmath82 .",
    "although we have developed this formalism for a six - dimensional cosmic string space - time , it can be adapted for a three , four and five dimensional spaces .",
    "the reason resides in the representations adopted for the dirac matrices in these dimensions . for three dimensional case",
    "the dirac matrices are given in terms of @xmath60 pauli matrices . for four and five dimensions ,",
    "the dirac matrices are given by the @xmath27 off - diagonal matrices from the first four and five matrices given in ( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "of course for these cases we have to discard the derivative associated with the respective extra coordinates in ( [ delta ] ) .",
    "so on basis on these arguments it is possible to generalize the eigenfunction of the operator ( [ k1 ] ) by :    @xmath83^{1/2}}e^{in\\varphi}j_{|\\nu^+|/\\alpha}(pr){\\cal{\\omega}}^{(+ ) } \\ ,   \\nonumber\\\\      \\phi_\\lambda^{(-)}(x)&=&\\frac{e^{ik.x}{\\sqrt{p}}}{[\\alpha(2\\pi)^{n+1}]^{1/2}}e^{in\\varphi}j_{|\\nu^-|/\\alpha}(pr){\\cal{\\omega}}^{(-)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath84 are the eigenfunctions of the the operator @xmath75 , @xmath85 is the bessel function , and @xmath86 , where we have defined @xmath87 , the ratio of the magnetic flux by the quantum one , in terms of an integer number , @xmath88 , and its fractional part , @xmath89 . in ( [ phi ] ) we may assume @xmath90 , which are related with the dimensions of the space considered : three , four , five or six , as explained before .",
    "now we are in position to calculate the green function by using ( [ d2 ] ) , ( [ phi ] ) and ( [ omega ] ) as show below @xmath91 with the help of @xcite we can express ( [ d2a ] ) by @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the modified bessel function .",
    "the calculations of the renormalized vev of the energy - momentum tensor associated with massive quantum fields in cosmic string space - time , have been developed by many authors cited in @xcite .",
    "all of these calculations involve very complicated integrals . in order to present more suitable expressions ,",
    "the authors make applications taking the massless limit in previous results . here , in this paper , we shall explicitly exhibit the renormalized vacuum expectation value of the fermionic energy - momentum tensor for different dimensions of the space - time in closed expressions .",
    "so , in order to do that we shall consider two different limiting cases which allow us to reach this objective as shown in the following subsections .      in this subsection",
    "we shall calculate the bispinor associated with a charged massless fermionic fields in an arbitrary dimensional cosmic string space - time .",
    "so taking @xmath94 in ( [ d2b ] ) we obtain @xcite @xmath95 where @xmath96 in the above expression , @xmath97 is the associated legendre function .",
    "it is possible to express this function in terms of hypergeometric function @xcite by : @xmath98 in this analysis we identify the parameter @xmath99 with @xmath100 and take @xmath101 .",
    "so the relevant hypergeometric function is @xmath102 if @xmath103 is a even number , this function becomes a polynomial of degree @xmath104 ; however being @xmath103 an odd number , this function is an infinite series .    as special applications of this formalism , let us consider specific values for @xmath103 as shown in the following .",
    "for this case the manifold corresponds to a three - dimensional cosmic string space - time .",
    "the green function can be obtained by substituting the legendre function by its integral representation below @xcite , @xmath105 in ( [ d2c ] ) and developing the sum over @xmath106 .",
    "after some steps we get @xmath107 where @xmath108}{\\cosh(t/\\alpha)-\\cos(\\varphi-\\varphi ' ) } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] being @xmath109 .",
    "for the case with @xmath110 the bulk corresponds to a four - dimensional cosmic string space - time . for this case",
    "the green function is very well known .",
    "it takes a simple form due to the fact that the respective associated legendre functions be expressed by @xmath111 substituting this function into ( [ d2c ] ) it is possible to develop the sum on the angular quantum number @xmath106 , providing @xmath112 with @xmath113 having the same functional form as @xmath114 in ( [ s ] ) .",
    "this case is a new one , it corresponds to a five dimensional cosmic string space - time having a magnetic flux running along the string . for this case",
    "the bispinor depends on the associated legendre function @xmath115 , which can be expressed in a integral representation by using the relation @xmath116 and ( [ q ] ) .",
    "after some intermediates steps we obtain @xmath117      this case is also a new one , it corresponds to a six - dimensional cosmic string space - time .",
    "the complete green function is expressed by a @xmath25 diagonal matrix . as in ( [ n2 ] ) , this function can also be written in terms of elementary functions .",
    "the reason is because for @xmath110 , @xmath118 depends on @xmath119 , which is given by @xmath120 substituting this expression into ( [ d2c ] ) , and after some intermediate steps we arrive to : @xmath121 where the prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath122 .      in this subsection",
    "we shall provide a closed expression for the bispinor considering a non - vanishing mass term for the fermionic field .",
    "this will happen for a very special situation when @xmath23 is equal to the inverse of an integer number .",
    "smith , davies and sahni , and souradeep and sahni , cited in @xcite , have shown that when this occur , i.e. , for @xmath123 , the scalar green functions can be given as a sum of @xmath124 images of the minkowsiki space - time functions .",
    "recently the image method was also used in @xcite to provide closed expressions for massive scalar green functions for a higher - dimensional cosmic string space - time .",
    "the mathematical reason for the use of image method in these applications resides in the fact that the order of the bessel functions which appear in the derivations of the green functions , become an integer number .",
    "unfortunately , for the fermionic case , the order of the bessel function depends , besides the integer angular quantum number @xmath106 , also on the the factor @xmath125 .",
    "however , if we consider a charged fermionic field in the presence of a magnetic flux running along the string , an additional effective extra factor will be present , the fractional part of the ratio of the magnetic flux by the quantum one , @xmath89 .",
    "for the case where @xmath89 is equal to @xmath125 , and @xmath126 , the order of the bessel function becomes an integer number , and , in this case it is possible to use the image method to obtain the fermionic green function in a closed form .",
    "although being a very special situation , the analysis of vacuum polarization effects in this circumstance may shed light on the qualitative behavior of these quantities for non - integer @xmath124 .",
    "let us now investigate the effective @xmath60 diagonal matrix heat kernel , given in the integrand of ( [ d2 ] ) . using ( [ d2b ] ) , we have @xmath127    defining @xmath128 with @xmath129 , we can see that for @xmath130 and assuming @xmath123 , the order of the modified bessel function becomes an integer number if @xmath124 is also an integer number . in this way ( [ ka ] )",
    "can be expressed by @xcite : ] @xmath131 analogously , defining @xmath132 with @xmath133 , we obtain @xmath134 using the recurrence relation , @xmath135 and eq .",
    "( [ kaa ] ) , we get , after some steps , the following expression : @xmath136    the green function is given by @xmath137 using ( [ kaa ] ) , ( [ kab ] ) and with help of @xcite , this function becomes @xmath138 with @xmath139 being @xmath140 the modified bessel function .",
    "as we can see , the above green function of the square of the dirac operator corresponds , up to a phase factor , to a sum of @xmath124 images of minkowski space - time functions . for @xmath141 , and @xmath110",
    ", the above expression reduces to the standard four - dimensional green function @xmath142    we want to finish this section by saying that having obtained the complete green functions associated with the square of the dirac operator , for massless and massive fields , the fermionic propagators can be given by applying the dirac operator on this bispinor according to ( [ sf ] ) .",
    "in this section we shall calculate in a explicit form the renormalized vacuum expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath2 .",
    "as we have already mentioned in the last section , two physical situations will be considered here . because the metric tensor does not depend of any dimensional parameter , for the massless fermionic field case we can infer that the vev of the energy - momentum tensor will depend only on the radial distance @xmath12 . for massive fermionic case",
    ", it is expected a dependence on the mass of the field too .",
    "the renormalized vev of the energy - momentum tensor must obey the conservation condition , @xmath143 and for massless fields provide the correct trace anomaly for space - time of even dimension @xcite : @xmath144 however , because this space - time is locally flat and there is no magnetic field in the region outside the string , the coefficients @xmath145 and @xmath146 vanish @xcite .. ] as we shall see , taking into account these informations , it is possible to express all components of the energy - momentum tensor in terms of only one .",
    "here we shall calculate the energy density only .    using the point - splitting procedure @xcite",
    ", the vev of the energy - momentum tensor has the following form : @xmath147s_f(x , x ' ) \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath148 , and the bar denotes complex conjugate . because the dependence of the fermionic green function on the time variables , the zero - zero component of the energy - momentum tensor reads : @xmath149 which can be expressed by @xmath150 in the obtainment of the above expression we have to use the fact that the bispinor @xmath151 is diagonal and @xmath152 .",
    "now after these brief comments about general properties of the vev of the energy - momentum tensor , we shall start explicit calculations of this quantity for massless and massive fermionic fields specifying the dimension of the manifold .      in this subsection",
    "we shall calculate the zero - zero component of vev o the energy - momentum tensor for massless fermionic fields , specifying the dimension of the manifold .",
    "let us start with a three dimensional cosmic string space - time .",
    "the vacuum polarization effects associated with massive scalar fields in a three - dimensional conical space - time has bee developed by guimares and linet cited in @xcite .",
    "because the calculation of the vev of the energy - momentum tensor involves complicated integrals , the authors give its expression only for the massless case , which coincides with with the result found by souradeep and sahni , also cited in @xcite .",

    "in fact , for these specials values , and taking @xmath159 , the upper and lower components of ( [ d3b ] ) can be expressed as @xmath220 with @xmath221 given by ( [ cs ] ) , which coincides with the respective quantities found by image method , @xmath222 \\nonumber\\\\      { \\cal{d}}_e^{(-)}(x',x)&=&\\frac1{4\\pi^2}\\left[\\frac1{\\rho_0 ^ 2}-\\frac1{\\rho_1 ^ 2}\\right ] \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] being @xmath223 and @xmath224 given in ( [ rho ] ) . in this situation the contributions on the renormalized vev of the energy - momentum tensor due to the upper and lower components of the feynman propagator cancel each other .",
    "the renormalization procedure adopted in this paper to calculate the vacuum expectation value of the fermionic energy - momentum tensor was the point - splitting one . in this sense",
    "we had analysed the behavior of this quantity at the coincidence limit and extracted all the divergences in manifest form by using the hadamard function .",
    "it has been proved that this procedure provides finite and well defined results @xcite .",
    "an alternative regularization procedure can also be used .",
    "the local @xmath225function procedure leads essentially to the same conclusions as given by the point - splitting one @xcite . the dewitt - schwinger expansion of the green function for an @xmath7dimensional curved spacetime is given in @xcite .",
    "so , by using the dimensional regularization , it follows from the general expression that for the cosmic string spacetime this expansion contains a single term only , @xmath226 where @xmath227 is the hankel function of the second kind , @xmath228 being @xmath229 the one - half of the square of the geodesic distance .",
    "the above function coincides with the minkowski green function",
    ". the subtracted contribution due to this function renormalizes the cosmological constant .",
    "all these regularization procedures lead to the same finite result for renormalized quantities .",

    "the method of images applied in ( [ heat ] ) to calculate the green function associated with massive fermionic fields in a conical space - time and in the presence of a magnetic flux running along the string , is an application of the generalization formula of the generating function for the modified bessel functions of integer order .",
    "it well known that @xmath231 taking @xmath232 we have @xmath233 making the change @xmath234 in ( [ a1 ] ) , and summing over @xmath235 from @xmath236 until @xmath237 , we may write @xmath238 now using the identity @xmath239 we obtain @xmath240",

    "using the fact that @xmath244 we have @xmath245 because the integrand is divergent at the point @xmath246 , we have to change the variable @xmath247 before applying the leibnitz formula for derivative of an integral . so the second derivative has the form below , @xmath248 which can be written as @xmath249 taking the limit @xmath250 we obtain @xmath251 we can see that the integral above is finite because for small value of @xmath252 , @xmath253 .",
