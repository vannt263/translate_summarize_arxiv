    "the model describes an outbreak epidemic with host - vector population dynamics in a geographical region .",
    "the epidemic outbreak begins at time 0 in a small sub - region in which the epidemic disease is not yet present .",
    "the goal of the model is to aid understanding of how the introduction of a very small number of cases in a specific location in the geographic region will result in a dissipation or a sustained and growing epidemic .",
    "the focus of the study is on the importance of spatial effects in these possible outcomes .",
    "if the equations of the model do not depend on spatial considerations , then a corresponding system of ordinary differential equations can be analyzed for their asymptotic behavior ( appendix ) .",
    "the geographical region is denoted by @xmath0 .",
    "the background population of uninfected hosts in @xmath1 has geographic density @xmath2 , which is unchanging in time in the demographic and epidemic context of the outbreak .",
    "thus , the model is viewed as applicable to an early phase of the epidemic , during which the epidemic does not alter the basic geographic and demographic population structure of hosts , and the susceptible host population is not altered significantly by immunity to re - infection .",
    "the model consists of the following compartments :    * the density of infected hosts @xmath3 at time @xmath4 at @xmath5 , with initial condition @xmath6 . * the density of uninfected vectors @xmath7 at time @xmath4 at @xmath5 , with initial condition @xmath8 . * the density of infected vectors @xmath9 at time @xmath4 at @xmath5 , with initial condition @xmath10 .",
    "the initial state @xmath6 consists of a relatively small number of infected hosts located at time @xmath11 in a small sub - region of @xmath1 .",
    "this input corresponds to an arrival of infected hosts from outside @xmath1 .",
    "this input is assumed to have a threshold level , which may include multiple cases produced from arriving cases .",
    "the background uninfected mosquito population has an initial state @xmath8 , which decreases as the infected vector population increases .",
    "the initial population of infected vectors @xmath10 in @xmath1 is assumed proportional to @xmath6 .",
    "the equations of the model in the case that transmission from vectors to hosts is year - round are @xmath12      * theorem .",
    "* let @xmath1 be a bounded domain in @xmath13 with smooth boundary @xmath14 such that @xmath1 lies locally on one side of @xmath15 .",

    "there exists a unique global classical solution @xmath22 , to ( [ eq-1]),([eq-2]),([eq-3 ] ) , satisfying boundary conditions @xmath23 and initial conditions @xmath24    * proof . * we first observe that a unique classical solution @xmath25 exists in @xmath26 on a maximal interval of existence @xmath27 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "standard arguments ( @xcite ) guarantee that @xmath25 remain nonnegative for @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , the classical solution can be globally defined if we can establish uniform _ a priori _ bounds . set @xmath29 and add equations ( [ eq-2 ] ) and ( [ eq-3 ] ) to obtain @xmath30 theorem 1 in @xcite guarantees the existence of a unique global classical solution @xmath31 to equation ( [ eq-4 ] ) satisfying @xmath32 further , in @xcite it is proved that there exists @xmath33 , @xmath34 , such that @xmath35 .",

    "define the basic reproduction number of the model ( [ eq-1]),([eq-2]),([eq-3 ] ) as @xmath44 @xmath45 is interpreted as the average number of new cases generated by a single case at a given location @xmath46 in @xmath1 .",
    "our motivation for this definition is the basic reproduction number @xmath47 of the spatially independent model ( appendix ) .",
    "simulations of the spatially dependent model show that for certain parameterizations of equations ( [ eq-1]),([eq-2]),([eq-3 ] ) , the solutions have the following behavior : ( 1 ) if @xmath48 everywhere in @xmath1 , then the populations of both infected hosts and infected vectors extinguish , and the populations converge to the disease free equilibrium .",
    "( 2 ) if @xmath49 in some sub - region @xmath50 , then the populations of both infected hosts and infected vectors converge to an endemic equilibrium independently of the initial conditions , and even if the average value of @xmath45 in all of @xmath1 is @xmath51 .",
    "we apply a version of the model ( [ eq-1]),([eq-2]),([eq-3 ] ) to the 2015 zika outbreak in rio de janeiro municipality in brazil . because disease transmission in the municipality is seasonal , equations ( [ eq-2 ] ) and ( [ eq-3 ] )",
    "must be modified to account for seasonality .",
    "we assume that there is a mosquito population breeding term @xmath52 , depending on time .",
    "we also assume that there is an on - going mosquito loss term @xmath53 , corresponding to the average mosquito life - span @xmath54 , independent of the carrying capacity loss term @xmath55 .",

    "the brazilian health ministry ( @xcite,@xcite ) reported that rio de janeiro state ( population approximately 16,000,000 ) registered a count of 25,930 cumulative cases from january 1 , 2016 to april 1 , 2016 ( with incidence of 156.7 cases per 100,000 inhabitants ) , and 32,312 cumulative cases by april 23 , 2016 ( with incidence of 195.2 cases per 100,000 inhabitants ) .",
    "the ministry ( @xcite,@xcite ) reported no new cases in the state from april 24 , 2016 to may 7 , 2016 . in @xcite the weekly case data for rio de janeiro municipality is given from november 1 , 2015 through april 10 , 2016 , during which time the reporting of cases became mandatory .",
    "the period can be viewed as the 2015 - 2016 seasonal mosquito transmission period of the epidemic in the municipality .",
    "we simulate this case data for the rio de janeiro municipality with the following parameterization : the time units are weeks .",
    "the spatial units are kilometers and @xmath57 .",
    "the average length of the infectious period of infected people is approximately 1 to 2 weeks and we set @xmath58 ( @xcite ) .",

    "the simulation agrees qualitatively with the weekly reported case data for rio de janeiro municipality in @xcite ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the spatial distributions of infected people expand from a very small number of initial cases in a small sub - region of the municipality , and disperses throughout the eastern region of the municipality ( figure 5 ) .",
    "the mosquito population rises rapidly and reaches carrying capacity at approximately 14 million in earlier 2016 . during much of mosquito season ,",

    "we take @xmath89 ( figure 6 ) .",
    "the infected population again expands from the initial location and disperses throughout the eastern region of the municipality , but at approximately one - half the number of infected cases as in example 1 .",
    "the reason is that the density of susceptible people is lower in this initial location than the initial location in example 1 .",

    "we prove that the partial differential equations model ( [ eq-1]),([eq-2]),([eq-3 ] ) is mathematically well - posed , and compare its properties to an analogous ordinary differential equations model in the spatially independent case ( appendix ) .",
    "the outcomes of the model depend on the spatially distributed basic reproduction number @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath48 everywhere in @xmath1 , then the epidemic will extinguish . if @xmath49 in some sub - region of @xmath1 , then the epidemic will spread and converge to an endemic equilibrium throughout all of @xmath1 , independently of the location of the sub - region .",

    "a simulation of the model provides qualitative agreement with the case data reported by the brazilian ministry of health in @xcite .",
    "the model simulation suggests that the zika epidemic in rio de janeiro municipality , will rise each season from initial locations with very small numbers of infected people , and spread throughout the municipality .",
    "the evolution of the epidemic depends on the initial location of infected cases . in general , the evolution of the epidemic depends on the parameterization and initialization of the model , and can be limited only by reduction of the disease parameters throughout the entire region . if the number of actual infected cases is significantly higher than the number of reported cases , then the parameterization must be adjusted accordingly .",
