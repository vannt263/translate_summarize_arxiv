    "similarly , `` polar likes polar '' is the empirical rule@xcite for determining the compatibility among different molecules . in this paper",
    ", we derive a theory of this rule in the context of polymers and provide a quantitative description of the role played by the polar nature of monomers in determining the commingling of polymers@xcite .",
    "the predictions of the theory are also relevant to the growing usage of dipolar polymers such as peptide - polymer conjugates@xcite , polypeptoids@xcite , and polyzwitterions@xcite .",
    "when the polymer components do not bear any charges or dipoles , the phase behavior is predicted by the classical flory - huggins theory @xcite by lumping all pair - wise short - ranged interactions into a set of ` chi ' parameters .",
    "this theory has been very successful in capturing various qualitative aspects of phase behavior of uncharged polymers , despite its well - known limitations .",
    "although some improvements can be made by addressing composition fluctuations@xcite and monomer architecture@xcite , the presence of long - ranged forces due to charges and dipoles on the chain backbone makes the extension of the flory - huggins theory nontrivial . for polymeric systems with ionizable monomers , theories based on field - theoretic treatments@xcite",
    "have borne out to be successful in treating the phase behavior@xcite .",
    "when the repeat groups of the polymer chains carry permanent dipoles , theoretical formulation becomes technically difficult primarily due to the anisotropy of the intersegment orientational interactions and due to its long - range nature .",
    "so far , only single chain of dipoles has been addressed@xcite .",
    "it was shown@xcite that the dipolar interactions can be treated as freely rotating at higher temperatures , but at lower temperatures chain orientations freeze into a multitude of frustrated conformations .    in this paper , we consider only the high - temperature regime of rotating dipoles without being subjected to frustrated states and address the commingling of two polymer components bearing different dipole moments .",
    "we consider the inter - segment interaction to consist of two parts .",
    "the first part is the usual contribution from the excluded - volume effect ( van der waals interaction ) responsible for the flory - huggins ` chi ' parameter , and the second part is due to point dipoles @xcite .",
    "the induced dipole moment arising from the polarizability of the molecules necessitating a self - consistent computation is ignored .",
    "in addition to calculating the phase diagram , we have followed the formalisms of cahn - hilliard @xcite and helfand - tagami - sapse @xcite and calculated the interfacial tension between two coexisting phases and the accompanying density profiles .",
    "we show that consideration of dipolar interactions naturally leads to the introduction of a local electric field dependent dielectric function@xcite in the theory along with its dependence on the temperature and local number density of dipoles .",
    "concentration dependence of the dielectric function is shown to have significant effects on the phase segregation and interfacial properties .",
    "in particular , we have shown that an increase in mismatch between the dipole moments , which is equivalent to an increase in dielectric mismatch between polymer pairs , leads to an enhanced phase segregation as well as sharper interfaces . as a result of sharper interfaces , interfacial tension for an interface between the coexisting phases increases with an increase in the dielectric mismatch . also , these predictions are compared with theoretical treatment for freely rotating dipoles@xcite , which is valid only at very high temperatures .",

    "although we have not taken into account the variations in the magnitude of these electric dipole moments , but we allow the dipoles to be aligned depending on the local electric field . the physical origin of these electric dipoles is the polar nature of the monomers used to synthesize the polymers such as poly(ethylene oxide ) and bipolymers like polypeptoids@xcite .",
    "for example , a difference in electronegativities of oxygen and carbon leads to a dipole moment of @xmath15 debye for ethylene oxide monomer@xcite .",
    "an important point regarding the origin of electric dipoles is worth mentioning here .",

    "<S> we present a generalized theory for studying phase separation in blends of polymers containing dipoles on their backbone . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is used to construct co - existence curves and to study the effects of dipolar interactions on interfacial tension for a planar interface between the coexisting phases . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a mismatch in monomeric dipole moments , or equivalently a mismatch in the dielectric constant of the pure components , leads to destabilization of the homogeneous phase . </S>",
    "<S> corrections to the flory - huggins phase diagram are predicted using the theory . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that the interfacial tension increases with an increase in the mismatch of the dipole moments of the components . </S>",
    "<S> density profiles and interfacial tensions are constructed for diffuse and sharp polymer - polymer interfaces by extending the formalisms of cahn - hilliard and helfand - tagami - sapse , respectively . </S>"
