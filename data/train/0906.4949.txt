    "solitons are robust nonlinear waves that appear in many facets of nature .",
    "they are localized , persistent in time , and collide elastically .",
    "solitons with both phase and amplitude are often described to lowest order in systems with weak local nonlinearity by the famous nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls )  @xcite .",
    "for example , the nls describes twist and curvature of a string in three dimensions  @xcite .",
    "however , corrections beyond the nls , necessary in order to more closely model soliton properties , are less universal .",
    "for instance , for solitons in optical fibers one must consider higher order dispersion .",
    "bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) are also well - known to be modeled by the nls , or gross - pitaevskii equation ( gp ) .",
    "dark solitons were theoretically predicted in becs  @xcite and subsequently have been observed in a number of experiments  @xcite .",
    "the nls then represents taking the lowest order average of quantum operators from the quantum many - body description ; therefore , it is called a _",
    "mean - field theory_. one naturally expects thermal or quantum corrections to mean - field theory",
    ". regarding thermal corrections , recent finite temperature studies  @xcite based on coupling boltzmann equations to the nls have indicated that thermal fluctuations cause dark solitons to decay .",
    "the question then arises , are quantum corrections , called quantum fluctuations , sufficiently large so as to change the basic properties of dark solitons , a fundamental prediction of mean - field theory and a ubiquitous property of weakly nonlinear systems ?",
    "the answer so far has been a resounding no .",
    "first , bec soliton experiments have worked in regimes with very small quantum fluctuations .",
    "such fluctuations can be calculated quantitatively with the bogoliubov - de - gennes equations ( bdg ) for weakly interacting becs , and one finds much less than 1% for the system s ground state  @xcite .",
    "second , bdg methods have been used to describe quantum fluctuations of solitons .",
    "the main result is that within bdg framework the dark soliton , which manifests as a density notch with a phase jump across it , appears to be filled in : the soliton s position is uncertain , so that in an ensemble average of measurements it appears blurred  @xcite .",
    "however , these studies predict that in any particular measurement the soliton is indeed localized , and the predictions of mean - field theory for the density , phase , and stability properties of the soliton hold .    in this article",
    ", we provide new answers to the question of how quantum fluctuations affect dark solitons , expanding on the results which two have us have presented in ref .",
    "we show that in a regime of stronger quantum fluctuations , the results based on bdg theory no longer hold .",
    "solitons are not just delocalized in an ensemble measurement , but do in fact decay in the zero temperature quantum setting .",
    "they even collide inelastically . by use of a recently invented method for entangled quantum many - body dynamics in one dimension  @xcite",
    ", we show explicitly how both mean - field theory and bdg theory break down . to obtain large quantum fluctuations we make use of an optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "becs in optical lattices are known to have two distinct quantum phases , the mott insulator and the superfluid @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that throughout our study we remain in the superfluid phase .",
    "we also treat higher order correlations , a key signal for dark soliton decay in a fully quantum theory , where the mean field does not force symmetry breaking on the system  @xcite .    in general , the unprecedented tunability permitted by optical lattice systems",
    "gives both theorists and experimentalists alike an ideal setting for investigating quantum many - body phenomena in a controlled fashion . in these systems",
    ", experimentalists can adjust the height of the lattice by changing the intensity of the laser field used to create it . with this knob",
    ", one can vary the ratio of the interaction to kinetic energy in the governing lattice hamiltonian , e.g. the bose - hubbard hamiltonian ( bhh ) .",
    "in fact , the first major experimental result for becs in optical lattices  @xcite used just such a carefully controlled increase in optical lattice height past a critical value to demonstrate the mott - superfluid quantum phase transition in the bhh  @xcite . more generally , at present , experimentalists also have precise control over the lattice site filling factor , lattice geometry and dimensionality , species type , and atom - atom interaction strength , symmetry , and sign ; the latter properties are due to use of a feshbach resonance .",
    "the system is also well - isolated from the environment , greatly curbing the intervention of finite - temperature effects .",
    "all of these appealing properties make it possible to investigate out - of - equilibrium quantum many - body dynamics governed by the corresponding hamiltonian , an aspect of the problem on which we focus in this paper and one that received little attention before the advent of optical lattices .",
    "specifically , we study how quantum many - body phenomena , e.g. , quantum fluctuations and quantum entanglement , affect the behavior of dark solitons formed by ultracold bosons loaded into one - dimensional optical lattices .",
    "regardless of the physical system in which they occur , solitons are characterized by stable , non - dispersing propagation of either a minima ( dark solitons ) or a maxima ( bright solitons ) of the physically relevant dependent variable , e.g. , particle number density in becs .",
    "it has been well - known for decades , since the seminal papers by tsuzuki on nonlinear waves in the gp equation  @xcite and by zakharov and shabat on the inverse scattering transform  @xcite , that solitons exist as solutions to the one - dimensional ( 1d ) nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) .",
    "it is also well - established that in the mean - field limit bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) are well - described by the nls  @xcite .",
    "the success of the gp equation as a model to describe the ultracold atomic bose gas , as well as the observation of solitons in systems such as photonic crystals and nonlinear waveguide arrays , has excited a broad new interest in solitons in the last decade .",
    "both dark  @xcite and bright  @xcite solitons were observed rather early on in systems of becs in harmonic trap geometries , and , due to ever improving experimental technique , there have very recently been exciting new developments regarding the creation and evolution of dark solitons formed by becs  @xcite .    to treat solitons in the context of a lattice via mean - field theory , there are two approaches : ( 1 ) a full solution of the nls with an external lattice potential  @xcite , in which case the lattice soliton solutions of the nls have been mapped out in detail  @xcite , or ( 2 ) a finite - element discretization of the nls obtained by projecting the condensate wave function onto a basis of localized wave functions at each lattice site  @xcite thus resulting in the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( dnls ) .",
    "discrete lattice solitons have been studied using the dnls both in purely mathematical  @xcite and bec - related  @xcite contexts . on the experimental side ,",
    "bright gap solitons have been observed in a system of repulsive @xmath0rb  atoms trapped in a weak optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that we will treat dark solitons with a size much greater than the lattice spacing , not gap solitons deep in the band gap which are localized on a few sites .",
    "in contrast to these mean - field approaches , we use the bhh , a fully quantum model .",
    "the dnls emerges as the equation of motion when taking the mean - field limit of the bhh  @xcite .",
    "this is why we are able to make quantitative predictions regarding the accuracy of using mean - field theory to describe soliton dynamics .",
    "related studies regarding the effect of quantum fluctuations on excited condensates in continuous geometries , e.g. , dark solitons , using few - mode approximations and bdg - based methods can be found in the works of dziarmaga , sacha , and karkuszewski  @xcite , as we have already alluded to . using related methods",

    "this results in an array of 1d tubes with a lattice potential in the longitudinal direction .",
    "this is not a true 1d quantum model though , in that we assume the transverse confinement length is still much larger than the range of the interatomic interaction potential and the actual atomic size .",

    "( [ eqn : gausspot1 ] ) to effectively create two independent boxes so the wave function would heal perfectly to zero at the center of the lattice .",
    "thus , for a gaussian potential of finite amplitude and width , a certain fraction of the energy used to form the notch goes into the creation of phonons and a certain fraction goes into the creation of the soliton  @xcite .",
    "also , standing solitons have a @xmath74 phase drop across the notch in the form of a perfect step function ; hence , ideally we should take @xmath75 and @xmath76 . experimentally , the parameter @xmath77 , i.e. , the width of the phase profile , represents diffraction - limited fall - off of the far - detuned laser beam used to raise half the lattice  @xcite .",

    "the normalized variance plot indicates that the relative number fluctuations are largest in the regions of space - time where the soliton is filling in .",
    "the filling - in phenomena can be attributed to allowed two - body scattering processes that deplete particles out of the original solitonic condensate wave function into modes with nonvanishing density at the lattice center . to see this explicitly , we plot the densities of the four most highly occupied natural orbitals in fig .
