    "in 1948 , casimir @xcite calculated that quantum fluctuations of electromagnetic fields cause attraction between two parallel metal plates at zero temperature .",
    "this can be interpreted as a physical manifestation of the zero - point energy predicted by quantum field theory @xcite . as the plates are brought near each other ,",
    "the allowed modes between them are limited . because each electromagnetic mode has an energy of @xmath3 at @xmath4 k",
    ", the total energy of the configuration depends on the plate separation .",
    "this energy landscape results in an attractive force between the plates .",
    "while casimir s description holds for ideal metal plates , a more general expression was derived by lifshitz , dzyaloshinskii , and pitaevskii @xcite .",
    "this formulation is used for comparison with experiments and is valid for both real metals and dielectrics . in this theory",
    ", the force between two uncharged surfaces can be derived according to an analytical formula ( often called the lifshitz or casimir - lifshitz equation ) that relates the zero - point energy to the dielectric functions of the interacting surfaces and of the medium in which they are immersed . in 1972 ,",
    "parsegian and weiss @xcite derived an expression for the nonretarded ( where the speed of light is taken to be infinite ) interaction energy between two dielectrically anisotropic plates immersed in a third anisotropic material .",
    "barash @xcite analyzed a similar problem including retardation effects and found an equation for the helmholtz free energy per unit area . in the nonretarded limit ,",
    "the results of parsegian , weiss , and barash are in agreement .    in the expressions derived by parsegian , weiss , and barash ,",
    "the casimir energy between two parallel , birefringent plates depends on both their separation and their orientation . between two parallel , positive birefringent slabs with in - plane optical anisotropy ,",
    "the lowest energy state is when the two optical axes are aligned .",
    "this results in a torque that rotates the plates to this configuration .",
    "while the casimir - lifshitz force is the subject of much discussion and has been verified in a number of experiments @xcite , there have been no published experimental attempts to measure the torque between anisotropic materials .",
    "in addition to the early work of parsegian , weiss and barash , recent theoretical work has been performed including a derivation of a more simplified equation of the torque between two plates in one dimension @xcite , the torque between two dielectric slabs with different directions of conductivity @xcite , and numerical calculations based on real materials @xcite .",
    "most discussions of potential casimir torque measurements involve either levitating microdisks @xcite or a torsion pendulum @xcite . in the first method",
    ", microscale birefringent disks would be levitated over a birefringent substrate with casimir - lifshitz repulsion or an electrostatic force .",
    "the casimir torque would then cause the freely rotating disks to rotate so that their optical axes would align with that of the substrate . in the proposed torsion pendulum experiment",
    ", a macroscopic birefringent crystal would be attached to a quartz torsion pendulum and brought near another birefringent crystal .",
    "the casimir torque would affect the period of natural oscillations of the torsion pendulum , allowing for its detection .    here",
    "we propose a method that is in analogy to a static torsion pendulum with a thick liquid crystal layer as the twisted bulk .",
    "as the uniformly aligned liquid crystal is brought near a birefringent crystal , the casimir torque aligns the liquid crystal molecules with the solid crystal s optic axis , which in turn causes a twist through the bulk of the liquid crystal .",
    "a similar experiment was proposed by smith and ninham @xcite in 1973 but , to our knowledge , was never carried out . here",
    "we provide a calculation including retardation effects of the expected results of a similar geometry , as well as detailed experimental considerations .    instead of using the liquid crystal in the isotropic phase as a spacer layer ( which is experimentally unfeasible )",
    ", a thin layer of sio@xmath0 separates the liquid crystal from the solid crystal .",
    "varying the sio@xmath0 thickness is equivalent to changing the distance between parallel plates .",
    "if both the liquid crystal and the birefringent crystal have positive uniaxial anisotropy , then the casimir torque causes the liquid crystal molecules to twist towards the extraordinary axis of the solid crystal .",
    "because the liquid crystal is anchored at the glass interface , the director ( i.e. the locally preferred molecular orientation ) is twisted through the bulk by the casimir torque at the boundary at the opposite interface .",
    "this geometry is depicted in fig . [",
    "fig : setup ] .",
    "this experimental design is similar to methods for measuring the azimuthal anchoring energy of liquid crystals on treated substrates @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of liquid crystal alignment induced by a rubbed polymer layer itself is the subject of much study but is thought to include physical grooves , aligned polymer chains , and the van der waals torque for surfaces in contact @xcite .",
    "the last of these is equivalent to the short - ranged casimir torque of our proposed study , though distinguishing the van der waals effect from other alignment effects is difficult .",
    "however , previous experiments have suggested the anisotropic van der waals effect as the mechanism of liquid crystal alignment at a surface .",
    "schadt and schmitt @xcite used linearly photopolymerized layers to align liquid crystals with a van der waals interaction .",
    "lu @xcite also provided evidence that the van der waals interaction is an important component of the liquid crystal alignment at treated polymer layers .",
    "however , these experiments do not isolate the van der waals torque from other surface effects , because the liquid crystal is in contact with the substrate .",
    "our proposed experiment would demonstrate this effect over a distance of tens of nanometers ( and in doing so measure the long - range retardation effects of the casimir torque ) . finally , we can relate measured data to casimir torques calculated from the dispersive properties of the materials .",
    "smith and ninham @xcite considered the nonretarded case of this system and predicted measurable distortions of the liquid crystal director . here",
    "we carry out the full retarded calculation of the casimir torque by considering its effect on a thin boundary layer .",
    "that is , in comparison to the liquid crystal bulk with thickness @xmath5 m , most of the casimir torque is felt by a thin layer of thickness @xmath6 nm .",
    "also , because the total liquid crystal twist through the bulk is less than @xmath7 , the liquid crystal in the region of @xmath8 is nearly uniformly aligned .",
    "therefore , we approximate the casimir torque on this layer from the uniaxial crystal to be the same as that experienced by a uniformly aligned and semi - infinite liquid crystal slab . these approximations are treated with more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : boundary ] .",
    "most materials undergo a phase transition from solid to liquid at a melting point .",
    "liquid crystals exhibit an intermediate phase in which there is some local ordering due to the molecular structure .",
    "nematic liquid crystals are the simplest class .",
    "they can be thought of as long molecules ( fig .",
    "[ fig : molecule ] ) that tend to align the long axis with their neighbors .",
    "the local direction of molecular orientation is written as a vector of unit length called the director @xmath9 . because the molecules have different dispersive properties along the different axes , one can change the properties of the liquid crystal bulk by manipulating the director .",
    "drawing of the 5cb molecule , which is a nematic liquid crystal at room temperature .",
    "the extraordinary axis is along the molecular axis .",
    "because 5cb has positive birefringence , @xmath10.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we carry out calculations using the physical properties of 4-cyano-4@xmath1-pentylbiphenyl ( 5cb ) . in bulk , this is a positive uniaxial material so the dielectric function is higher along the long molecular axis .",
    "to derive the interaction between two infinite slabs , barash wrote the helmhotz free energy between two birefringent materials at finite temperature as an infinite sum over matsubara frequencies @xmath11 @xcite:@xmath12 where @xmath13 represents the distance between the two slabs and @xmath14 is the angular separation of their extraordinary axes .",
    "we have performed calculations for room temperature based on experimental considerations ; however , the zero - temperature calculation for the casimir torque will provide the correct result to within @xmath15@xmath16 for the separations presented in this work ( @xmath17 nm ) .",
    "the zeros of @xmath18 as a function of real frequency @xmath19 indicate allowed surface modes between the two infinite slabs .",

    "a torque applied at @xmath41 twists the director to @xmath42 . using calculus of variations ,",
    "the lowest energy configuration is given by a linear twist , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 .",
    "the elastic energy of the bulk per unit area is then : @xmath45 if the director at @xmath41 is twisted to @xmath46 , there is an energy penalty and associated restoring torque at that boundary .",

    "the torque applied at the boundary twists the director until the torque balance equation is satisfied : @xmath49 .",
    "if the casimir torque is in the approximate form @xmath50 , where @xmath14 is the angle between the two extraordinary axes of the birefringent materials , then the torque is approximately @xmath51 ( which has the same form as the planar rapini - papoular approximation @xcite ) , and the torque balance equation yields : @xmath52 to predict the director twist for our proposed experiment , we calculate @xmath25 using eqs .",

    "( [ eq : balance ] ) to find the twist caused by the casimir torque , @xmath53 . in the proposed experiment , @xmath53 ( or @xmath46 ) will be measured to obtain @xmath25 via @xmath54",
    "the liquid crystal can be treated as an anisotropic bulk material for the calculation because the twisting is small throughout the thickness that experiences the casimir interaction .",
    "the spacing between the liquid crystal and solid birefringent crystal is on the order of @xmath5510 nm , and the liquid crystal layer is about 100 @xmath56 m thick . following parsegian @xcite , the penetration depth of the casimir interaction is on the order of the material separation .",
    "so , the most important region of the liquid crystal is the 10 nm in contact with the sio@xmath0 ( or conservatively , the 100 nm ) .",
    "this 100 nm is the 0.1% of the liquid crystal nearest the birefringent crystal .",
    "because the liquid crystal will be twisted a maximum of @xmath57 radians throughout the bulk , the liquid crystal director will vary by a maximum of @xmath580.05@xmath2 in the relevant region for the casimir torque , which has no appreciable effect on the torque s magnitude .",
    "this approximation can also be justified by considering the reflection matrix of the liquid crystal stack .",
    "the casimir energy of the system is a function of the reflection matrices of the two materials at the matsubara frequencies .",
    "our method assumes that , at the matsubara frequencies , the reflection matrix of the slowly twisted liquid crystal is nearly the same as that of an untwisted , bulk liquid crystal with the same alignment at the boundary .",
    "the first matsubara frequency at room temperature , @xmath59 thz , corresponds to a wavelength of @xmath60 m. the higher frequences correspond to shorter wavelengths , so this first term has the longest penetration depth .",
    "we calculated the reflection matrices at this frequency between the twisted and untwisted stacks using the berreman @xmath61 matrix method , and found them to be numerically identical to four significant figures @xcite .",
    "the casimir interaction energy is largely unaffected by the slow twist of the liquid crystal throughout the bulk .",
    "hence , to several significant figures , the torque experienced by the liquid crystal layer is felt entirely at the nearest boundary and is only a function of the director orientation at that boundary .",
    "common methods for fabricating single liquid crystal cells have been previously reported in refs . @xcite and can be used for this experiment .",
    "a rubbed alignment layer of polyvinyl alcohol ( pva ) can be used to cause the liquid crystal molecules to align along the rubbed direction at the surface .",
    "the birefringent crystal with a thin , isotropic sio@xmath0 layer ( with thickness @xmath62 nm ) is sandwiched with the pva - treated glass with a spacing of @xmath63 @xmath56 m ( this value can be measured optically ) .",
    "the liquid crystal is then introduced into the cell via capillary action .",
    "the filling process may induce some alignment along the direction of liquid crystal flow ; however , baking the sample above the lc clearing temperature ( @xmath64 c for 5cb ) and allowing it to cool slowly will eliminate this effect .",
    "as the liquid crystal cools to room temperature , the director settles into the lowest energy state described in sec .",
    "[ sec : balance ] .",
    "the magnitude of the casimir torque effect can then be measured by observing the twist of the liquid crystal director .",
    "the final director twist @xmath46 can be measured optically .",
    "this method is similar to a technique for measuring azimuthal surface anchoring strengths of liquid crystals @xcite . when linearly polarized light is incident on an adiabatically twisted nematic liquid crystal stack ( in which the pitch of the twist is much larger than the wavelength of light ) , the polarization state is rotated to follow the liquid crystal director .",
    "this is known as the adiabatic approximation for twisted nematics and is the principle behind twisted nematic liquid crystal displays @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "white light polarized at @xmath7 shines onto the stack as in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "the jones vector of this light is @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the intensity .",

    "caculated twist of a 100 m layer of 5cb caused by a casimir torque induced by various birefringent crystals at distance @xmath13 from one end of the liquid crystal stack .",
    "the incident light is polarized at @xmath7 to the ordinary axis at the top of the 5cb stack , but the director is twisted by the casimir torque , which causes the light polarization to rotate @xmath53 towards the extraordinary axis at @xmath68.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to calculate the expected results from an experiment , we consider a liquid crystal layer thickness of 100 @xmath56 m and calculate the lowest energy state of the system using eq .",
    "( [ eq : balance ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : angle_results ] shows the expected results for this case .",
    "the liquid crystal bulk is predicted to twist by over @xmath64 when the stack is separated by 5 nm from batio@xmath21 , and a twist of several degrees is expected for separations of @xmath69 nm ( well into the casimir regime ) .",
    "when near a birefringent material that has negative birefringence over a large frequency range ( such as lithium niobate ) , the liquid crystal would twist towards the ordinary axis instead of the extraordinary axis . this would provide further confirmation that dispersion effects are causing the director to twist .",
    "we have proposed an experiment for measuring a casimir torque between a birefringent crystal and a liquid crystal separated by an isotropic spacer layer .",
    "we provide complete calculations of the expected results for several materials at a range of separations and include details for a proposed experiment .",
    "this experimental design avoids many of the difficulties involved with a torsion pendulum or levitating microdisks .",
