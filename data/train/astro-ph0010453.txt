    "high quality measurements of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) probe the cosmic fluctuations generated during an inflationary epoch in the very early universe @xcite . recently ,",
    "boomerang @xcite and maxima @xcite teams announced the clear detection of a first acoustic peak at an angular scale @xmath0 , which confirms the most important prediction of inflation : the universe seems to be spatially flat @xcite .",
    "another generic prediction of inflation is that the primordial spectra of density perturbations and gravitational waves are _ almost _ scale - invariant .",
    "more cmb precision measurements will be available soon .",
    "we argue @xcite that cmb predictions on the basis of the simplest inflationary model , slow - roll inflation @xcite , are not as precise as could be believed from the accuracy of the power spectra @xcite .",
    "we compare the predictions from the slow - roll approximation @xcite with the exact solutions from the model of power - law inflation @xcite .",
    "we find unacceptable large errors in the predictions of multipole moments .",
    "the reason is as follows : the primordial spectrum is best approximated at some pivot scale @xmath1 .",
    "a small error in the spectral index gives rise to a large error at wavenumbers that differ significantly from @xmath1 , due to a large lever arm .",
    "a natural choice for the pivot scale is the present hubble scale , but leads to extremely large errors for high multipole moments . a shift of the pivot scale to the scale of the first acoustic peak decreases these errors",
    "dramatically ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .    in @xcite",
    "we compare the improved ( optimal pivot scale ) slow - roll predictions with recent cmb data ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "most data analysis so far @xcite was based on a power - law shape of the primordial spectra .",
    "this shape is _ not _ predicted by the slow - roll approximation , only the first two terms in a taylor expansion with respect to the wavenumber coincide .",
    "slow - roll inflation is very simple and is an attractor for many inflationary models .",

    "the condition for inflation is @xmath8 , whereas slow - roll inflation is characterized by @xmath9 , and negligible higher derivatives .",

    "instead of fitting ten cosmological parameters we fix the values of otherwise measured parameters and assume that slow - roll inflation is the correct theory .",
    "in figure [ fig2 ] we present the sum of scalar and tensor cmb band power for a @xmath49cdm model with @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the boltzmann code used here was developed by one of us ( a.r . ) .",
    "we see without a @xmath52 analysis that qualitatively different inflationary models are consistent with the observations : both models with @xmath53 give reasonable fits , one of these models has a flat scalar spectrum ( with @xmath54 ) , the other one has a negative tilt ( with @xmath55 ) .",
    "both models have an important contribution of gravitational waves ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "we emphasize that the generic slow - roll predictions ( [ specsrd ] ) and ( [ specsrgw ] ) do not have a power - law shape .",
    "this fact induces large differences to multipole moments that are predicted under the assumption that the power - law shape ( [ specpl ] ) is the generic inflationary prediction . besides using the correct primordial spectrum",
    "a clever choice of the pivot scale can hide unavoidable uncertainties of the multipole moments in the cosmic variance on one side and in the instrumental noise on the other side of the spectrum .",
