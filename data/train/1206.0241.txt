    "there is a still growing interest in quantifying and measuring correlations in composite quantum systems ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "such notions as entanglement , quantum discord and other entropic measures of quantumness proved to be useful in these investigations @xcite . while entanglement from a very definition reflects by itself some specific structure of the density matrix representing the state , discord measures the amount of quantum correlations between subsystems in terms of mutual von neumann entropy .    on the other hand , for many years the nonadditive generalizations of shannon and von neumann entropy functions , such as renyi entropy @xcite , tsallis entropy @xcite and others @xcite , has been used to describe some aspects of statistical and thermodynamic behaviour of systems far from equilibrium .",
    "these families of entropy functions parametrized by @xmath1 seem to incorporate in a natural manner some correlations present in composite systems .",
    "in what follows we focus on tsallis entropy which , except additivity , displays similar properties ( nonnegativity , concavity ) to those of von neumann entropy @xcite and therefore , in most applications in the field of quantum information , can be used as well @xcite . in particular , an observation due to abe @xcite that using tsallis entropy one can detect more separable two - qubit werner states than using shannon entropy seems very promising .    in this article , we investigate the generalization of mutual entropy and quantum discord when defined in terms of tsallis entropy .",
    "it turns out that even at the classical level this generalization can be done following two paths .",
    "hence , at the quantum level we introduce two quantities , called @xmath0-discords @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which generalize quantum discord , and we investigate them for werner and isotropic states .",
    "we give some arguments that the use of @xmath0-mutual entropy derived from @xmath0-expectation value results in the @xmath0-discord function which , at least for werner and isotropic states , reflects in a more appropriate way the amount of quantum correlations for all values of @xmath1 than the other one .    finally , we give an example indicating that both types of @xmath0-discord can take negative values for some specific quantum states belonging to the family of two - qubit x states @xcite .",
    "let us start we some basics of classical information theory , where , in fact , some ambiguities crucial for further analysis arise .",
    "let us consider two classical systems @xmath4 and @xmath5 described by discrete probability spaces @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "information contained in any probability distribution @xmath8 can be quantified by the shannon entropy function @xmath9 consider now a joint probability space @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the joint probability , and define conditional probability @xmath12 as @xmath13 hence , shannon entropy of conditional probability ( [ cond - prob ] ) reads @xmath14 averaging it over subsystem b leads to the notion of _ conditional entropy _",

    "unfortunately , this quantity has no useful properties , in particular , there is no relation similar to ( [ s(a|b ) ] ) ! * if someone wants the property ( [ s(a|b ) ] ) to hold then an expectation value with modified weights @xmath29 should be considered , i.e. , @xmath30 as a consequence of the following property of @xmath0-logarythm : @xmath31 one easily obtains that @xmath32 but @xmath33 is not a probability distribution , hence @xmath34 is not a legitimate expectation value . * to avoid this , one defines a @xmath0-_expectation value _ of any random variable @xmath35 and probability @xmath8 as @xmath36\\;:=\\;\\frac{\\sum_jp_j^qf_j}{\\sum_jp_j^q},\\ ] ] which obviously preserves unity , @xmath37=1 $ ] .",

    "[ qt ] that the use of ( [ mut - inf-2 ] ) has some advantages .",
