    ". the [ nii]@xmath26583/h@xmath1  flux ratio , 0.049 , derived from this low - dispersion spectrum is really the ratio of nebular [ nii]@xmath26583 flux to the combined supernova and nebular h@xmath1  flux .",

    "it is not clear whether the [ nii ]  flux itself has changed .",
    "nebular lines toward sn  1978k are also detected in the uv spectra of sn  1978k obtained with the faint object spectrograph on board the hubble space telescope on 1994 september 26 and 1996 september 2223 ( schlegel et al .",

    "hii  region along the line of sight \" implied by the radio spectrum of sn  1978k ( ryder et al .",
    "1993 ) . however , as we argue below , the [ nii ]  line strengths suggest that this  hii  region \" is circumstellar , rather than interstellar .",
    "the nebular [ nii]@xmath26583/h@xmath1  line ratio , 0.81.3 , is unusually high for normal interstellar hii  regions in a spiral galaxy .",
    "for example , hii  regions in m101 have [ nii]@xmath26583/h@xmath1  ratios @xmath170.3 ( kennicutt & garnett 1996 ) .",
    "sn  1978k is at the outskirts of ngc1313 , where abundances are expected to be low and the hii  excitation is expected to be high . if the nebular h@xmath1  and [ nii ]  lines toward sn  1978k originate in an interstellar hii  region , we would expect the [ nii]@xmath26583/h@xmath1  ratio to be @xmath150.1 or lower . a low interstellar [ nii]/h@xmath1  ratio is confirmed by the bright hii  region detected along the slit at @xmath18 east of sn  1978k .",
    "this hii  region is brighter than the nebula toward sn  1978k in the h@xmath1  line , but its [ nii]@xmath26583 line is not detected .",
    "we may rule out an interstellar hii  region explanation for the narrow nebular lines seen in sn  1978k .",
    "the high [ nii]@xmath26583/h@xmath1  ratio may be caused by a high electron temperature or a high nitrogen abundance .",
    "these conditions can be easily provided by sn  1978k and its progenitor .",
    "if the nebula was ionized by the uv flash of sn  1978k , the electron temperature may be higher than that of a normal hiiregion , as in the case of sn  1987a s outer rings ( panagia et al .",
    "1996 ) . however , the [ nii]@xmath26583 line intensity increases by only a factor of 2 for an electron temperature increase from 10,000 k to 15,000 k. this increase can not explain fully the observed high [ nii]/h@xmath1  ratio . a higher nitrogen abundance is needed .",
    "an elevated nitrogen abundance is characteristic of ejecta nebulae around evolved massive stars , such as luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) and wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars ; the [ nii]@xmath26583/h@xmath1  ratios of these ejecta nebulae are frequently observed to be @xmath151 ( esteban et al .  1992 ; smith et al .  1998 ) .",
    "therefore , the most reasonable origin of the nebular emission lines toward sn  1978k would be a circumstellar ejecta nebula .",
    "the observed high [ nii]/h@xmath1   ratio may be caused by the combination a high nitrogen abundance and a high electron temperature .",
    "sn  1978k s circumstellar ejecta nebula has a very high density , as strong [ nii]@xmath25755 line is observed in sn  1978k s spectrum .",
    "the [ nii ]  ( @xmath26548+@xmath26583)/@xmath25755 ratio is measured to be 2.55 by ryder et al .  (",
    "1993 ) , and 6.0 by chugai et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , indicating that collisional de - excitation is significant for the @xmath19 level of n@xmath20 .",
    "if we assume an electron temperature of 11.5@xmath21 k , the observed [ nii ]  line ratios imply electron densities of 312@xmath22 @xmath5 .",
    "the circumstellar ejecta nebula of sn  1978k can be compared to those observed around lbvs and wr stars .",
    "the density of sn  1978k s nebula is higher than those of wr nebulae , but within the range for lbv nebulae ( stahl 1989 ; esteban et al .",
    "we adopt the emission measure em = @xmath6 @xmath7 pc determined from the radio observations ( montes et al .",
    "1997 ) for sn  1978k s nebula .",

    "1992 ; esteban & vlchez 1992 ) , but lies toward the high end of the range typically seen in lbv nebulae , a few @xmath310@xmath24 to 10@xmath4 @xmath7 pc ( hutsemkers 1994 ; smith et al .",
    "1998 ) . finally ,",
    "the h@xmath1  and [ nii ]  velocity profiles seen in our sn  1978k spectrum suggest an expansion velocity  line is @xmath2535 km  s@xmath0 . the expansion velocity can also be approximated by the hwhm of the h@xmath1   and [ nii ]  lines , 4055 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "] of 4055 km  s@xmath0 , which is lower than those of most ejecta nebulae around wr stars but is within the range for lbv nebulae ( nota et al .  1995 ;",
    "chu , weis , & garnett 1999 ) .",
    "it is thus likely that the observed nebula toward sn  1978k was ejected by the progenitor during a lbv phase before the sn explosion .",
    "this ejecta nebula could be either part of the circumstellar envelope that the sn ejecta expands into , or a shell that is detached from the circumstellar envelope .",
    "we will demonstrate below that the latter is unlikely .",
    "if the ejecta nebula is a detached shell , the observed emission measure and density imply that the shell thickness is only 4@xmath310@xmath26 to 4@xmath310@xmath27 pc .",
    "the thickness of a detached , dense shell will be broadened by diffusion , and may be crudely approximated by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the isothermal sound velocity , @xmath30 is the expansion velocity , and @xmath31 is the radius . we find that the radius of sn  1978k s free - expanding ejecta shell would have to be no greater than @xmath32 pc , which is smaller than the expected radius of the sn ejecta .",
    "this is impossible .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the narrow h@xmath1  and [ nii ]  lines must originate in the pre - shock , ionized circumstellar envelope of sn  1978k .    the narrow nebular lines from the pre - shock , ionized circumstellar envelope of sn  1978k are not unique among sne .",
    "the high - dispersion spectrum of sn  1997ab shows narrow p - cygni h@xmath1  and narrow [ nii]@xmath26583 lines , and the fwzi of the p - cygni h@xmath1  line , 180 km  s@xmath0 , is comparable to that of sn  1978k s h@xmath1  line ( salamanca et al .  1998 ) .",
    "the p - cygni profile of sn  1997ab s narrow h@xmath1  line indicates a high density , @xmath33 @xmath5 .",
    "this density exceeds the critical density of the @xmath19 level of n@xmath20 , and causes a weak [ nii]@xmath26584 line ( see figure 1 of salamanca et al .",
    "if sn  1997ab s circumstellar material is nitrogen - rich like that of sn  1978k , we predict that its [ nii]@xmath25755 line is strong and should be detectable as well .",
    "sn  1997ab is very likely a younger version of sn  1978k , and sn  1978k s nebular h@xmath1  line may have exhibited a p - cygni profile in 1979 - 1980 .",
    "the most notable sn characteristic of sn  1978k is its apparent lack of very broad ( a few thousand km  s@xmath0 ) emission lines . adopting canonical expansion velocities and sizes for sn  1978k , ryder et al .",
    "( 1993 ) has derived a mass of @xmath2580 m@xmath34 for the circumstellar envelope .",
    "this mass is too large to reconcile with the current understanding of massive stellar evolution . to lower the circumstellar mass , chugai et al .",
    "( 1995 ) propose that the circumstellar envelope is clumpy .",
    "we consider that the large size @xmath150.1 pc adopted by ryder et al .",
    "( 1993 ) is over - estimated and inconsistent with the expansion velocity implied by our observed h@xmath1  fwhm of 450 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "there is no need to assume an unseen , larger expansion velocity .",
    "we suggest that the small expansion velocity of sn  1978k is caused by the dense circumstellar envelope , which has quickly decelerated the expansion of sn ejecta . if optical spectra had been obtained immediately after the sn explosion in 1978 , very broad emission lines would have been detected .",
    "rapid deceleration of sn ejecta has been observed in two other sne , sn  1986j and sn  1997ab .",
    "sn  1986j has been noted to have very similar spectral properties as sn  1978k@xmath25755 line , indicating a very high density and possibly an enhanced nitrogen abundance . ] .",
    "sn  1986j probably exploded four years before its initial discovery in 1986 ( rupen et al .",
    "1987 ; chevalier 1987 ) .",
    "its optical spectra obtained soon after the discovery show narrow hydrogen balmer lines and nitrogen forbidden lines , indicating an expansion velocity @xmath35 600 km  s@xmath0   ( leibundgut et al .  1991 ) .",
    "sn  1997ab is the only other sn for which narrow nebular emission lines from the dense circumstellar envelope have been unambiguously resolved and detected .",
    "sn  1997ab s light curve peaked in 1996 ; the fwhm of its h@xmath1  line decreased rapidly from 2500 km  s@xmath0  on 1997 march 2 to 1800 km  s@xmath0  on 1997 may 30 ( hagen et al .  1997 ; salamanca et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "clearly , sn  1978k , sn  1986j , and sn  1997ab all possess very dense circumstellar envelopes , and we may expect them to evolve similarly .",
    "the expansion of sn  1978k might have slowed down to below 1000 km  s@xmath0  within the first @xmath152 years after the explosion , and the sn ejecta could not have reached a radius greater than @xmath150.02 pc in 1990 .",
    "a factor of 5 reduction in the radius would lower ryder et al.s ( 1993 ) estimate of mass to a reasonable value , and the hypothesis of a clumpy circumstellar envelope will no longer be necessary .",
    "previous spectrophotometric observations of sne were rarely made with spectral resolutions better than 2  .",
    "our echelle observation of sn  1978k has demonstrated that high - dispersion spectroscopy is powerful in resolving pre - shock , ionized circumstellar material .",
    "a high - dispersion spectroscopic survey of young sne in nearby galaxies may detect more circumstellar envelopes and even detached ejecta ring nebulae , such as the rings around sn  1987a ( burrows et al .",
    "the density and velocity structures of these circumstellar envelopes would shed light on the mass loss history as well as physical properties of the massive progenitors .",
    "our spectrum of sn  1978k unfortunately covers only the [ nii ]   and h@xmath1  lines . in order to measure the density , temperature , and abundances of the circumstellar material ,",
    "it is necessary to obtain high - dispersion spectra covering a large wavelength range .",
    "it is also important to monitor the spectral changes indicative of density changes in the circumstellar envelope .",
