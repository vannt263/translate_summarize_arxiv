    "a @xmath1-hypernucleus in its ground - state decays to non - strange nuclear systems through the mesonic ( mwd ) and non - mesonic ( nmwd ) weak decay mechanisms . in mwd",
    "the @xmath1 hyperon decays to a nucleon and a pion in the nuclear medium , similarly to the weak decay mode in free space : @xmath13 in which the emitted nucleon ( pion ) carries a momentum @xmath14 mev / c . for a @xmath1-hypernucleus , the total decay width ( or equivalently the decay rate ) @xmath15",
    "is given by the sum of the mesonic decay width ( @xmath16 ) and the non - mesonic decay width ( @xmath17 ) , where the first term can be further expressed as the sum of the decay widths for the emission of negative ( @xmath8 ) and neutral ( @xmath18 ) pions : @xmath19 with @xmath20 expressed in terms of the hypernuclear lifetime as : @xmath21 mwd is suppressed in hypernuclei with respect to the free - space decay due to the pauli principle , since the momentum of the emitted nucleon is by far smaller than the nuclear fermi momentum ( @xmath22 mev / c ) in all nuclei except for the lightest , @xmath23-shell ones .",
    "the theory of hypernuclear mwd was initiated by dalitz @xcite , based on a phenomenological lagrangian describing the elementary decay processes ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , and motivated by the observation of mwd reactions in the pioneering hypernuclear physics experiments with photographic emulsions that provided means of extracting hypernuclear ground - state spins and parities ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent summary . following the development of counter techniques for use in @xmath24 and @xmath25 reactions in the 1970s and 1980s ,",
    "a considerable body of experimental data on @xmath8 and/or @xmath18 is now available on light @xmath1-hypernuclei up to @xmath26 : @xmath27 @xcite , @xmath28 @xcite , @xmath29 @xcite , @xmath4 and @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "comprehensive calculations of the main physical entities of mwd were performed during the 1980s and 1990s for very light @xmath23-shell @xcite , @xmath0-shell @xcite and @xmath30-shell hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "the basic ingredients of the calculations are the pauli suppression effect , the enhancement of mwd owing to the pion - nuclear polarization effect in the nuclear medium as predicted for mwd in refs .",
    "@xcite , the sensitive final - state shell - structure dependence , and the resulting charge dependence of the decay rates .    an important ingredient of mwd calculations is the choice of pion - nucleus potential which generates pion - nuclear distorted waves that strongly affect the magnitude of the pionic decay rates .",
    "indeed , for low - energy pions , the pion - nucleus potential has been studied so far through @xmath31-nucleus scattering experiments @xcite and measurements of @xmath32-rays from pionic atoms @xcite ; the study of mwd in which a pion is created by the decay of a @xmath1 hyperon deep inside the nucleus offers important opportunities to investigate in - medium pions and to discriminate between different off - shell extrapolations inherent in potential models . for this reason mwd",
    "continues to be an interesting item of hypernuclear physics , and precise and systematic determinations of @xmath8 and @xmath18 are very welcome .    in the present work we report on new measurements by the finuda experiment of mwd of hypernuclei in the @xmath0-shell , comparing the measured @xmath33 spectra and decay rates with the calculations by one of the authors @xcite that update the calculations by motoba _",
    "these two sets of spectroscopic calculations agree reasonably well with each other for all hypernuclei considered in the present report , except for @xmath5 which is discussed in detail below .",
    "the measured spectra are consistent with the observation , made in these shell - model calculations , that the partial decay contributions from the high - lying continuum of the daughter nuclear system outside the @xmath34 @xmath0-shell configuration are unimportant in this mass range .",
    "the level of agreement between the reported measurements and the calculations allows us to confirm the previous spin - parity assignments made for @xmath2 and @xmath4 , and to assign @xmath35 to @xmath5 ground - state .",
    "finuda is a hypernuclear physics experiment , with cylindrical symmetry , installed at one of the two interaction regions of the @xmath36 @xmath37 collider , the infn - lnf @xmath38-factory .",
    "a description of the experimental apparatus can be found in @xcite .",
    "here we briefly sketch its main components , moving outwards from the beam axis : the _ interaction / target region _ , composed by a barrel of 12 thin scintillator slabs ( tofino ) , surrounded by an octagonal array of @xmath39 microstrips ( isim ) facing eight target tiles ; the _ external tracking device _ , consisting of four layers of position sensitive detectors ( a decagonal array of @xmath39 microstrips ( osim ) , two octagonal layers of low mass drift chambers ( lmdc ) and a stereo system of straw tubes ( st ) ) arranged in coaxial geometry ; the _ external time of flight detector _ ( tofone ) , a barrel of 72 scintillator slabs .",
    "the whole apparatus is placed inside a uniform 1.0 t solenoidal magnetic field ; the tracking volume is immersed in @xmath40 atmosphere to minimize the multiple scattering effect .",
    "the scientific program of the experiment is focussed on the study of spectroscopy and decay of @xmath1-hypernuclei produced by means of the @xmath41 reaction with @xmath42 s at rest : @xmath43 by stopping in very thin targets the low energy ( @xmath44 mev ) @xmath42 s coming from the @xmath45 decay channel . in ( [ s - ex ] )",
    "@xmath46 indicates the target nucleus and @xmath47 the produced @xmath1-hypernucleus .",
    "@xmath1-hypernuclei decay through both the mesonic weak decay processes : @xmath48 and the non - mesonic weak decay processes : @xmath49 where the final nuclear states in ( 6 - 9 ) are not necessarily particle stable . in contrast to",
    "the mesonic decays , the non - mesonic decays are not pauli blocked , producing high - momentum nucleons ( @xmath50 mev / c ) .",
    "the thinness of the target materials needed to stop the @xmath42 s , the high transparency of the finuda tracker and the very large solid angle ( @xmath51 sr ) covered by the detector ensemble make the finuda apparatus suitable to study the formation and the decay of @xmath1-hypernuclei by means of high resolution magnetic spectroscopy of the charged particles emitted in the processes ( [ s - ex ] ) @xcite , ( 6 ) and ( 8) @xcite ; the features of the apparatus give also the possibility to investigate many other final states produced in the interaction of stopped kaons with nuclei @xcite .    in this paper results are presented obtained by analyzing the data collected by the finuda experiment from 2003 to 2007 with a total integrated luminosity of @xmath52 . only targets leading to the formation of the @xmath0-shell hypernuclei @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56",
    "are here considered , namely @xmath57 ( 2@xmath58 , @xmath59 mm thick , natural isotopic composition ) , @xmath60 ( 2@xmath58 , @xmath61 mm thick , natural isotopic composition ) , @xmath62 ( 3@xmath58 , @xmath63 mm thick , natural isotopic composition , mean density @xmath64 ) and @xmath65 ( mylar walled , 1@xmath58 , @xmath66 mm thick ) , together with @xmath67 targets ( 2@xmath58 , @xmath59 mm thick , @xmath68 enriched ) leading to the production of @xmath69 ; @xmath69 is reported for the sake of completeness .    to investigate the mwd process ( 6 ) events where analyzed in which two @xmath6 s were detected in coincidence .",
    "one @xmath6 , with a momentum as high as @xmath70 mev / c , gives the signature of the formation of the ground - state of the hypernuclear system or of a low lying excited state decaying to it by electromagnetic emission .",
    "the second @xmath6 , with a momentum lower than 115 mev / c , gives the signature of the decay . by requiring this coincidence ,",
    "negative pions are the only negative particles originating from the @xmath42 s stopping point in the targets that enter the tracking volume of the apparatus .",
    "nevertheless , to get a cleaner data sample , only tracks identified as @xmath6 s by the finuda detectors were considered . in particular , the information of the specific energy loss in both osim and the lmdc s and the mass identification from the time of flight system ( tofino - tofone ) , if present , were used to obtain a multiple identification selection .    in the present analysis we required good quality tracks to determine the momentum of the formation @xmath6 .",
    "these tracks must originate in a properly defined fiducial volume around the primary @xmath42 vertex and are identified by four hits , one in each of the finuda tracking detectors ( _ long tracks _ ) , and are selected with a quite strict requirement on the @xmath71 from the track fitting procedure ( corresponding to a @xmath68 confidence level ) .",
    "they have a resolution @xmath72 fwhm in the region 260@xmath73280 mev / c ; this resolution is about twice worse than the best value obtained with top quality tracks @xcite for spectroscopy studies .",
    "the worsening was due to the more relaxed quality criteria applied to increase the statistics of the sample available for the coincidence measurement .",
    "in particular , no cut has been made to select the direction of the outgoing tracks .",
    ".summary of the momentum and binding energy ( b.e . ) intervals selected to identify the formation of various hypernuclear systems .",
    "first column : target nucleus @xmath74 ; second column : weakly decaying final hypernucleus ; third column : production - pion momentum interval ; fourth column : @xmath75 binding energy interval ; fifth column : references to previous missing mass spectroscopy experiments . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     to evaluate the number of formed hypernuclei the area of the inclusive binding energy spectra was evaluated within the intervals reported in table  [ tab1 ] , after subtraction of the @xmath76 background and of the @xmath42 in flight decay contribution , as described above .",
    "the obtained values of the branching ratios , @xmath77 , are reported in table  [ tab3 ] with statistical and systematic errors .",
    "the latter ones are due to the different techniques used to evaluate the areas and the background in the inclusive spectra , while the systematic error due to the detection threshold of the apparatus has been estimated to be less than @xmath78 and has been neglected . a preliminary account of the results presented here can be found in @xcite .",
    "total decay rates were calculated , using known @xmath79 values or relying on a linear fit to the known values of all measured @xmath1-hypernuclei in the mass range @xmath80 @xcite as shown in table  [ tab3 ] : @xmath81    a good agreement holds among the present results and previous measurements , when existing , and among the present results and theoretical calculations assuming ground state spins as listed in the caption .",
    "the calculated total decay rates for the other choice of ground state spins ( in brackets ) are substantially lower and disagree with the experimentally derived values",
    ". in particular , the total @xmath33 decay rate of @xmath56 and its decay spectrum shape , as evaluated here , agree with calculations by motoba _",
    "_ @xcite and by gal @xcite assuming a ground - state spin - parity assignment @xmath12 .",
    "these two calculations disagree for a @xmath10 spin - parity assignment , but as argued in section  [ p_mwd ] ( footnote ) the new calculation @xcite for @xmath56 corrects the older calculations @xcite .",
    "the calculation by gal  @xcite finds a significantly smaller total decay rate for @xmath10 spin - parity than for a @xmath12 spin - parity assignment , by @xmath82 lower than the rate evaluated by us as listed in the table .",
    "based on this argument a spin - parity @xmath10 is excluded and a spin - parity @xmath83 assignment is made .",
    "we have reported a systematic study of mwd of @xmath0-shell @xmath1-hypernuclei by the fi - nuda experiment , performing for the first time a magnetic analysis of spectra of @xmath6 s from mwd of @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "mwd decay rates @xmath84 have been evaluated and compared with previous measurements and theoretical calculations . the spin - parity assignments @xmath85 and @xmath86 were confirmed and a new assignment , @xmath87 , was made based on the shape of the mwd spectra and the evaluated decay rates .",
