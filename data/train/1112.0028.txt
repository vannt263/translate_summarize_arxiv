    "owing to the tight coupling between the pulsation properties of cepheid variables and their fundamental stellar parameters , these stars have long provided crucial tests for stellar evolution models ( gautschy & saio 1996 ) and play a key role in the calibration of the extragalactic distance scale ( feast & walker 1987 ; freedman et al .",
    "nonetheless , for more than 40 years , a puzzle has persisted concerning the lingering discrepancy between stellar masses derived for cepheids using different methods ( e.g. , cox 1980 ) . in spite of improved radiative opacity calculations ( iglesias et al .",
    "1990 ; seaton et al .",
    "1994 ) , advances in evolutionary modeling ( bono et al .",
    "2002 ) , and the consideration of metallicity effects ( keller & wood 2006 ) , masses derived from stellar evolutionary models are found to be systematically @xmath610 - 15% higher than those derived from stellar pulsation models ( caputo et al .",
    "2005 ) or orbital dynamics , when available ( evans 2009 ) .    as described by neilson et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , one of the most promising solutions to the so - called `` cepheid mass discrepancy '' is likely to be convective core overshooting ( chiosi et al .",
    "1992 ) coupled with _",
    "mass - loss _ during the cepheid phase of evolution ( see also bono et al .",
    "mass - loss from cepheids has long been postulated , not only as a means of resolving the cepheid mass discrepancy , but as a natural consequence of stellar evolution and pulsation models ( e.g. , iben 1974 ; willson & bowen 1984 ; neilson & lester 2008 ) . the observational confirmation of mass loss from cepheids would impact not only our understanding of cepheid evolution , but would also have implications for the use of cepheids as distance indicators .",
    "for example , mass - loss can non - negligibly affect the structure and scatter in the infrared period - luminosity relation ( neilson et al .",
    "2009 ) , and the presence of circumstellar material can impact cepheid distance determinations made using the interferometric baade - wesselink method ( mrand et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "a number of previous authors have attempted to identify direct evidence of past or ongoing mass - loss from cepheids using observations ranging from ultraviolet to radio wavelengths ( e.g. , deasy & butler 1986 ; deasy 1988 ; welch & duric 1988 ; bohm - vitense & love 1994 ; mrand et al .",
    "2007 ; kervella et al . 2006 , 2009 ; neilson et al . 2009 ) . however , the results have been inconclusive , as the mass - loss rates ( or upper limits ) derived from these studies ( @xmath7 to @xmath8  yr@xmath5 ) span many orders of magnitude and are typically rather uncertain owing to their reliance on trace atomic and molecular species ( which may not be optimal tracers of past and ongoing mass - loss ) , their inability to sample very extended spatial scales , and finally , the strong dependencies of derived mass - loss rates on a variety of underlying assumptions ( e.g. , wind structure , gas - to - dust ratios , ionization fractions ) .    with the goal of obtaining new empirical constraints on cepheid mass - loss , marengo et al .",

    "we see that the maximum angular extent of the  nebula ( @xmath1 , corresponding to @xmath61.0  pc at the distance of @xmath0  cephei ) is aligned with the space motion direction .",
    "furthermore , the distribution of the  nearest to the position of @xmath0  cephei   ( @xmath65 ) is well correlated with the distributions of both the 24@xmath64 m and 70@xmath64 m emissions detected by _",
    "spitzer_. the  emission thus appears to be associated with the same dusty wind traced by the ir data .",
    "the peak of the  column density in figure  [ fig : mom0 ] ( @xmath66  @xmath67 ) does not correspond to the position of @xmath0  cephei  or its companion hd  213307 ( indicated on figure  [ fig : mom0 ] by a star and cross symbol , respectively ) , but rather lies @xmath68 to the northeast of @xmath0  cephei , near the apex of the shock structure delineated by the ir emission .",
    "such an offset of the peak emission from the star is not surprising , as this kind of leading density enhancement is a hallmark of the `` snowplow '' effect that may occur when a wind - emitting star moves supersonically through the ambient medium ( isaacman 1979 ; raga et al .",
    "2008 ) .    to the west of @xmath0  cephei ,",
    "i.e. , downstream from the star s trajectory , our vla image reveals a wake of material trailing the motion of the star .",
    "in contrast to the gaseous wakes associated with stars such as mira ( matthews et al .",
    "2008 ) and x  her ( matthews et al .",
    "2011 ) , the material downstream from @xmath0  cephei  is not well collimated and more closely resembles the wide - angle `` vortical tail '' associated with the carbon star irc+10216 ( sahai & chronopolous 2010 ) .",
    "numerical simulations of the interactions between stellar winds and streaming environments frequently predict broad , turbulent wakes , qualitatively similar to what we see in figure  [ fig : mom0 ] ( e.g. , wareing et al .",
    "2007a ) , although the degree of collimation and other properties of circumstellar wakes are highly sensitive to the stellar velocity , properties of the stellar wind , and the density of the ambient medium ( comern & kaper 1998 ) , such that fully unraveling the interplay between these factors for a particular source generally requires a specifically tailored model .    to gauge the total mass of  giving rise to the emission seen in figures  [ fig : cmaps ] and [ fig : mom0 ] over the velocity range @xmath69=15.0 to 38.2  , we have summed the emission surrounding the stellar position ( after correction for primary beam attenuation ) in irregularly shaped blotches defined by 3@xmath40 brightness contours .",
    "this approach yielded an integrated  flux density of @xmath70  jy  . using the relation @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the stellar distance in pc ( e.g. , roberts 1975 ) , this translates to an  mass of @xmath730.07@xmath23 .",
    "while this approach for measuring the total context minimizes the contribution of background noise to the measurement , it may result in the exclusion of weak emission or emission from regions not contiguous with the primary emission region in each channel . for comparison",
    ", we therefore summed the emission in each channel over a fixed rectangular aperture ( @xmath74@xmath75@xmath76 , centered 100@xmath77 west of @xmath0  cephei s position ) .",
    "we found @xmath78  jy  , consistent with our first estimate .",
    "we interpret our measured integrated  flux density as a lower limit to the amount of circumstellar material present around @xmath0  cephei  for two reasons .",
    "first , additional emission may lie undetected at velocities where our spectral images were contaminated by galactic emission .",
    "for example , if we assume that the  line profile is symmetric about the systemic velocity of @xmath0  cephei , this would imply that roughly two - thirds of the channels containing circumstellar signal were excluded from our flux density measurement .",
    "secondly , at our observing frequency , the vla d configuration is only sensitive to emission on angular scales @xmath79 .",
    "since this is comparable to the angular extent of the observed  nebula surrounding @xmath0  cephei , it is plausible that we have missed additional extended emission .",
    "this problem could be exacerbated if the most spatially extended material is decelerated as a result of its interaction with the ism ( e.g. , matthews et al .",
    "2008 ) ; this could in turn cause its velocity to be blueshifted into the portion of our band contaminated by galactic emission .",
    "mapping the region in  with a single - dish telescope would be of considerable interest as a means of searching for an additional large - scale emission component .",
    "the galactic ism is well known to exhibit structures on wide variety of scales , down to arcminutes and below ( e.g. , verschuur 1974 ; greisen & liszt 1986 ; heiles & troland 2003 ; begum et al .",
    "we therefore have considered the possibility that the  nebula that we have detected toward @xmath0  cephei  could simply be a chance superposition of an unrelated  cloud along the line - of - sight . however ,",
    "several lines of evidence indicate that this is extremely unlikely .",
    "as described above , the close correspondence between the  emission contours surrounding @xmath0  cephei   and the bow shock structure traced by fir emission implies that the two are linked .",
    "since the formation of a bow shock requires a stellar wind , a linkage between the  and fir emission argues strongly against the former arising from a random interstellar cloud .",
    "based on a survey with the arecibo @xmath80-band feed array , begum et al .",
    "( 2010 ) identified a population of compact  clouds associated with the galactic plane ( but distinct from the main galactic disk emission ) whose column densities and angular sizes overlap with those characterizing the  nebula that we have detected toward @xmath0  cephei .",
    "however , the mean characteristic linewidth of the clouds catalogued by begum et al . is @xmath81=4.2  ( fwhm ) , with values generally lying in the range of @xmath61 - 8  . only a handful of the 96 clouds in their sample exhibit velocity widths comparable to or larger than that of the integrated linewidth of the @xmath0  cephei  nebula ( @xmath82  based on a gaussian fit ) .",
    "furthermore , while begum et al . have underscored the possibility that a subset of their compact clouds may in fact be associated with mass - loss from variable stars , the closest association that they identified between a catalogued variable and a cloud from their sample has a projected separation of 10@xmath32 .",
    "since the  properties of the @xmath0  cephei  nebula are somewhat atypical of the general population of compact galactic clouds , we conclude that the probability of detecting such a cloud with a head - tail morphology at both the position and velocity expected for @xmath0  cephei , is extraordinarily small .",
    "one of the most powerful applications of our vla measurements is that they allow us to obtain new , independent constraints on the mass - loss rate from @xmath0  cephei .",
    "two key advantages of  observations for characterizing stellar mass - loss are first , that the  mass can be derived directly from the observed emission ( assuming it is optically thin ) and secondly , that spectroscopic imaging of  is sensitive to material much farther from the star than most other observational techniques for probing stellar mass loss , thereby tracing a larger fraction of the total mass - loss history .",
    "we consider two independent approaches for estimating the mass loss rate of @xmath0  cephei  from our vla data .",
    "our first method is to adopt a simplified model in which the star is assumed to be undergoing mass - loss through an isothermal , spherically symmetric wind that is in free expansion out to some radius @xmath84 . while pulsation - driven winds are inherently non - steady , we assume that the outflow can be approximated as quasi - steady when averaged over the timescales sampled by our observations .",
    "in the case where the  emission is optically thin , a theoretical line profile as a function of velocity , @xmath85 , for this idealized wind can be written as :      where    @xmath87^{0.5}\\ ] ]    ( see knapp & bowers 1983 ; olofsson et al .",
    "1993 ) . here",
    "@xmath88 is the conversion factor between units of brightness temperature in kelvins and mjy per beam for the radio telescope used , @xmath72 is the distance to the star , @xmath89 is the half - power synthesized beamwidth of the telescope , @xmath90 is the outflow velocity of the wind , @xmath64 is the mean atomic weight of the gas ( taken to be 1.3 ) , and @xmath91 is the mass of the hydrogen atom .",
    "all quantities are expressed in cgs units .    for comparison with the theoretical profile , we extracted from the vla data a spectrum , averaged over a single synthesized beam centered on @xmath0  cephei .",
    "we used the `` robust+1 '' data cube for this analysis ( table  3 ) , which has the highest angular resolution and should minimize contamination from structures in the envelope that are expected to lie outside the freely expanding wind ( e.g. , material in the tail and/or bow shock ) .",
    "we then compared the observed spectrum with a series of models where the mass - loss rate and wind outflow speed were taken as free parameters . before comparison with the data , each model computed from eq .",
    "1 was convolved with a broadening kernel to account for the finite spectral resolution and the gas turbulence .",
    "the model parameters were constrained by scanning a grid of possible values and minimizing @xmath92 .",
    "the outflow velocity , mass - loss rate , and smoothing kernel were incremented by values of 0.1  , @xmath93  yr@xmath5 , and 0.1  , respectively .",
    "the best - fitting model profile is overplotted on the observed spectrum in figure  [ fig : modelspec ] .",

    "while this is comparable to the rate derived from our model fitting above , the actual mass - loss rate could be smaller if some fraction of the observed  gas arises from swept - up interstellar material rather than directly from stellar mass - loss ( see   [ sweeping ] below ) .",
    "moreover , the dynamical crossing time of a stellar wake provides only a lower limit to its age ( see matthews et al .",
    "2008 ) ; if @xmath0  cephei  has been losing mass over a more prolonged interval , @xmath83 would also be lower .",
    "we note , however , that @xmath0  cephei  is believed to be on its second crossing of the cepheid instability strip ( berdnikov et al . 2000 ; turner et al .",

    "however , it is presently unknown whether this value should hold in the circumstellar environment of a cepheid .",
    "for example , the ratio @xmath131 is found to be 5 - 10 times higher than the canonical value in the circumstellar envelopes of some supergiants ( e.g. , skinner & whitmore 1988 ) , presumably because grain condensation has been incomplete in the winds of such stars ( mauron & josselin 2011 ) .",

    "( 2010b ) with our estimates .",
    "interestingly , such a value would be self - consistent in the sense that the empirically derived mass volume density of the dusty wind , @xmath133 , would then match the density for a wind with @xmath134  yr@xmath5 and @xmath90=35.6  as predicted by the mass continuity equation for stellar winds : @xmath135 ( lamers & cassinelli 1999 ) .    in summary ,",
    "our best estimate of the mass - loss rate of @xmath0  cephei  based on the combined results from our vla  data and _ spitzer _ infrared data is @xmath136 yr@xmath5 .",
    "the quoted error bar reflects the dominant systematic uncertainties and is based on the dispersion in the values derived from the independent methods presented in the preceding sections .        the majority of cepheids for which mass - loss rates ( or upper limits )",
    "have previously been determined (   [ introduction ] ) are inferred to have @xmath83 values at least two or three orders of magnitude smaller than we have derived for @xmath0  cephei  in the present work .",
    "we emphasize however , that none of these previous determinations exclude the possibility of significant mass - loss through a predominantly neutral atomic wind , of the type we have detected through  observations . in the case of @xmath0  cephei , the wind also revealed its presence through fir emission , although this need not be the case for all mass - losing cepheids , particularly those with higher effective temperatures ( where dust grains might be destroyed more readily ) , those that lack a companion ( which may play a role in exciting fir emission ) , or those residing in lower density environments ( where dust swept from the ism might contribute negligibly to the circumstellar fir emission ) .",
    "it is clear that an  survey of a larger sample of cepheids will be needed to obtain a better understanding of the importance of these factors and to assess the ubiquity of cepheid mass loss that is traceable through  21-cm line emission .",
    "based on theoretical studies to date , the most promising physical mechanism by which cepheids could lose significant mass appears to be the enhancement of radiatively driven mass loss through shocks and pulsation ( willson & bowen 1984 ; neilson & lester 2008 ) . from analytic models of this type , neilson & lester ( 2008 ) and neilson et al .",
    "( 2011 ) predicted typical cepheid mass - loss rates in the range 10@xmath137 to 10@xmath138  yr@xmath5 , although these rates are highly sensitive to the balance of forces and the adopted physical parameters for a given star . in particular , for shorter periods ( smaller masses ) , the mass - loss rate has a non - linear dependence on the stellar mass .",
    "thus for a cepheid with the mass and period of @xmath0  cephei , it appears that the models of neilson & lester and neilson et al .",
    "can in principle accommodate mass - loss rates as high as @xmath139  yr@xmath5 , consistent with our vla findings ( h. neilson , private communication ) . however , this conclusion may change if mass loss is highly episodic ( see below ) .",
    "secular period changes are well known to occur in cepheids , but are generally assumed to be dominated by evolutionary effects ( which result in changes in the effective temperature and luminosity ) rather than mass loss ( turner et al .",
    "it is therefore of considerable interest to compare the change in pulsation period for @xmath0  cephei , @xmath140 , that is predicted to occur as a result of its derived mass loss rate with the value of @xmath140 previously derived from observational data .",
    "equation  62 of neilson & lester ( 2008 ) provides an analytic formula for estimating the effect of mass loss on the rate of change in the stellar pulsation period .",
    "the most extreme period changes due to mass loss are expected to occur when changes in both @xmath141 and @xmath80 ( and hence @xmath142 ) are minimal . moreover ,",
    "the time scale for the decrease in total mass is predicted to be faster than the canonical evolutionary time scale . under these conditions ,",
    "the period changes dominated by mass - loss should always be positive .",
    "if we take the pulsation period and pulsation mass for @xmath0  cephei  from table  1 , together with @xmath143  yr@xmath5 , using equation  62 of neilson & lester we estimate the period change as a result of mass loss from @xmath0  cephei  to be @xmath144  s  yr@xmath5 .",
    "this is in apparent contradiction to the observed value of @xmath145  s  yr@xmath5 derived for @xmath0  cephei  by berdnikov et al .",
    "( 2000 ) based on data spanning 130 years .",
    "this suggests that mass loss is only one contributor to the secular period change and that evolutionary effects on the star following mass loss can not be ignored .",
    "an additional consideration is that mass loss inside the instability strip may be episodic .",
    "this could explain , for example , why most previous searches for cepheid mass loss ( which have only been sensitive to material in close proximity of the star ) have typically implied much lower rates of mass - loss than we infer from the vla and _ spitzer _ observations of @xmath0  cephei .",
    "however , in order to account for the same total amount of matter shed , highly episodic mass loss would require a boost in efficiency of the cepheid mass loss mechanism .",
    "one of the few cepheids that has been previously inferred to have a mass loss rate comparable to the rate we have derived for @xmath0  cephei   in our present study is rs  pup , where @xmath146  yr@xmath5",
    "( deasy 1988 ; barmby et al .",
    "rs  pup is unique among galactic cepheids in that it is surrounded by a prominent reflection nebula .",
    "the linear extent of this nebula ( @xmath61  pc ) is comparable to the nebula that we measure toward @xmath0  cephei .",
    "although the origin of rs  pup s nebulosity is consistent with copious mass loss , some authors have argued that the bulk of the nebular material may have originated during an earlier evolutionary phase , either as a be star ( kervella et al .",
    "2009 ) or as a red giant ( havlen 1972 ) .",
    "the question of whether such arguments could also be applied to @xmath0  cephei  is important , since it impacts whether subsequent mass loss during the cepheid phase will be sufficient to reconcile the cepheid mass discrepancy for this star .    the geometry of the nebula that we observe surrounding @xmath0  cephei  places strong constraints on this issue .",
    "the presence of an infrared - emitting bow shock and a head - tail structure to the nebula strongly suggest that @xmath0  cephei  has _ ongoing _ mass - loss .",
    "while this alone does not exclude the possibility that some portion of the material in its circumstellar nebula was shed during an earlier evolutionary phase ( e.g. , at the tip of the red giant branch ) , the fact that the dynamical age of the  nebula is smaller than the predicted duration of the second crossing of the instability strip for @xmath0  cephei  ( see   [ resolution ] ) suggests a strong likelihood that the bulk of the mass loss occurred during the cepheid evolutionary phase .",
    "further , the dynamical age of the nebula implies that even if some of the mass were lost during the red giant phase , this is likely to have immediately preceded the current cepheid crossing .",
    "hence the resulting mass loss would still necessitate a change in the evolutionary mass of the star between its first and its second ( current ) cepheid crossing .      in   [ vlamassloss ]",
    ", we estimated an asymptotic ( outflow ) velocity for the @xmath0  cephei  wind of @xmath11535.6  . to our knowledge , this is the first directly measured outflow velocity for a cepheid .",
    "an important characteristic of this value is that it is significantly smaller than the stellar escape velocity .",
    "adopting the mean stellar radius and pulsation mass for @xmath0  cephei  quoted in table  1 , the escape velocity from the photospheric surface of @xmath0  cephei  is @xmath147  , or several times the asymptotic velocity . while the radius and effective surface gravity of @xmath0  cephei  change over the course of its pulsation cycle , these effects are not sufficient to change this conclusion .",
    "andrievsky et al .",
    "( 2005 ) reported changes in the effective surface gravity of @xmath0  cephei  by a factor of 5.6 , which implies that even when the surface gravity is at its minimum , the escape velocity would still be @xmath148  .",
    "@xmath0  cephei   thus appears to share one of the defining characteristics of the cool winds of agb stars and late - type supergiants , where measured outflow velocities are in general several times smaller than the photospheric escape speed ( i.e. , @xmath149 ; see holzer & macgregor 1985 ; judge & stencel 1991 ) .",
    "interestingly , @xmath0  cephei  also appears to adhere to the empirical relation @xmath150 found by reimers ( 1977 ) based on observations of k giants and g and k supergiants ( see also judge 1992 ) , although the significance of this is unclear , since the physical underpinnings of this relation are poorly understood ( reimers 1977 ) and @xmath0  cephei  is not expected to be undergoing mass loss via the same mechanism as the stars in reimers sample .    as discussed by holzer & macgregor ( 1985 ) , the condition that @xmath149 has important implications for understanding and constraining the mechanism(s ) driving a stellar wind .",
    "for example , this requires the existence of some type of regulatory processes such that most of the driving energy of the wind goes into lifting material out of the stellar gravitational field rather than accelerating the flow .",
    "it follows that the inferred momentum flux of the wind , @xmath151 , represents only a small fraction of the overall energy required to drive the wind .",
    "an additional implication is that most of the energy added to the wind must be in the form of momentum rather than heat .      a fundamental question raised by our new empirically derived mass - loss rate for @xmath0  cephei  is whether this degree of mass loss can reconcile the mass discrepancy for the star .",
    "as described above , @xmath0  cephei  is believed to be on its second crossing of the instability strip .",
    "the total duration of this evolutionary stage ( as well as for the first and third crossings ) has previously been calculated for cepheids with different masses and metallicities by bono et al .",
    "( 2000a ) .",
    "however , these models did not include the effects of mass loss and therefore their direct application of the case of @xmath0  cephei  will not yield self - consistent results . to overcome this problem , we computed new intermediate - mass evolutionary models specifically for @xmath0  cephei .",
    "the theoretical framework we employed was developed by pietrinferni et al .",
    "the evolutionary tracks we adopted are available in the basti data base and were constructed by assuming a scaled solar chemical mixture and a fixed solar chemical composition with helium and metal abundances of @xmath152=0.273 and @xmath153=0.02 , respectively .",
    "several lines of empirical evidence support the occurrence either of mild convective core overshooting during the central hydrogen burning phases of intermediate mass stars ( barmina et al . 2002 ; cordier et al .",

    "the track plotted in the middle panel was constructed by assuming a mass loss starting from the main sequence phase according to the semi - empirical formula from reimers ( 1975 ) :    @xmath155    the free parameter @xmath156 was fixed at 0.4 ( pietrinferni et al . 2004 ; bono et al .",
    "2006 ) . following this prescription ,",
    "the mass loss rate during the evolution of the star will vary according to the changes in surface luminosity and radius .",
    "however , a comparison of the theoretical predictions plotted in the two top panels of figure  [ fig : tracksa ] shows that the impact of the mass loss based on the prescription of reimers is negligible , and indeed , both the extent in effective temperature of the blue loop and the evolutionary time spent inside the instability strip are minimally affected .",
    "plausible increases in the free parameter @xmath156 do not change this outcome , and the reimers model can not produce sufficient mass loss to account for the observed quantity of circumstellar material around @xmath0  cephei , nor can it reconcile the mass discrepancy for this star .    finally , in the bottom panel of figure",
    "[ fig : tracksa ] , we show an evolutionary track with the same initial mass of the top panels , but assuming a steady mass loss rate of @xmath157  yr@xmath5 during the evolutionary phases inside the cepheid instability strip .",
    "as expected , we found that implementing such mass - loss causes a significant decrease in the extent in effective temperature of the blue loop owing to the decrease in the envelope mass ( bono et al .",
    "2000a , and references therein ) , and in turn a decrease in the evolutionary time spent inside the instability strip .",
    "we also explored models with higher mass - loss rates ( not shown ) , but found that for @xmath158  yr@xmath5 , the temperature extent of the blue loop becomes significantly smaller , leading to implausibly short cepheid lifetimes .    to further constrain the impact of the initial stellar mass",
    ", we computed an additional set of evolutionary models with an initial stellar mass @xmath159 ( figure  [ fig : tracksb ] ) .",

    "the above findings indicate that either ( 1 ) the true mass - loss rate from @xmath0 cephei is at the low end of our empirically derived range , or ( 2 ) that a more complex treatment of mass loss is required ( e.g. , episodic mass loss or implementation of multi - dimensional eulerian hydrodynamic and stellar evolution codes ; mock et al .",
    "the inclusion of extra mixing and stellar rotation may also be important .",
    "we consider possibility ( 1 ) below , while possibility ( 2 ) will be explored in future works .",
    "if we assume that @xmath0  cephei  is currently near the midst of its second crossing of the instability strip , the models presented in figures  [ fig : tracksa ] and [ fig : tracksb ] predict that a cepheid with the chemistry and evolutionary mass of @xmath0  cephei  and undergoing mass loss at a rate of @xmath160  yr@xmath5 will have so far spent roughly ( 0.9 - 3.0)@xmath101  yr on the instability strip ( most of it on the second crossing ) .",
    "these numbers are consistent with the dynamical age of the  wake estimated in   [ vlamassloss ] .",
    "steady mass - loss at the prescribed rate over such an interval is predicted to result in a mass of circumstellar material of @xmath60.04 to 0.15@xmath23 .",
    "the upper end of this range is consistent with our empirically derived estimate for the mass of circumstellar material after correction for he (   [ vlamassloss ] ) , implying that such a model is self - consistent .",

    "<S> our vla data reveal a spatially extended  nebula ( @xmath1 or 1  pc across ) surrounding the position of @xmath0  cephei . the nebula has a head - tail morphology , consistent with circumstellar ejecta shaped by the interaction between a stellar wind and the interstellar medium ( ism ) . </S>",
    "<S> we directly measure a mass of circumstellar atomic hydrogen @xmath2 , although the total  mass may be larger , depending on the fraction of circumstellar material that is hidden by galactic contamination within our band or that is present on angular scales too large to be detected by the vla . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that the bulk of the circumstellar gas has originated directly from the star , although it may be augmented by material swept from the surrounding ism . </S>",
    "<S> the  data are consistent with a stellar wind with an outflow velocity @xmath3  and a mass - loss rate of @xmath4 yr@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we have computed theoretical evolutionary tracks that include mass loss across the instability strip and show that a mass - loss rate of this magnitude , sustained over the preceding cepheid lifetime of @xmath0  cephei , could be sufficient to resolve a significant fraction of the discrepancy between the pulsation and evolutionary masses for this star . </S>"
