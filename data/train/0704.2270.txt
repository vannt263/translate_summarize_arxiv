    "a cloud monitoring system , which watches the sky to detect clouds above an observatory , is a powerful apparatus for ground - based telescopes if we want to check the sky easily and to execute some remote or automated observations .",
    "the telescopes and their instruments are sure to be safe if we can monitor clouds on time and can close the dome slit before cloud coverage becomes heavy and rain drops come .",
    "other types of weather sensors , such as rain or humidity sensors , are sometimes late to alert us to close the dome . with a cloud monitor , we also can always be sure whether the data acquired by the telescope has been affected by clouds or not .",
    "one of the smartest methods of seeing clouds from the ground is to use some thermal infrared wavebands in which clouds themselves emit thermal radiation or reflect radiation originating from ground or sea .",
    "a ccd camera with a fish - eye lens is cheap , but the appearance of clouds in optical is deceptive because their brightness depends strongly on the intensity of the moon and city lights that illuminate them . using a similar system ,",
    "shamir & nemiroff ( 2005 ) developed an algorithm to make a whole - sky opacity map by means of measuring the extinctions for many stars .",
    "however , it does not give us a direct view of the cloud distribution in the sky .",
    "an uncooled thermal imager with panoramic optics suits a robotic telescope because it requires little maintenance .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) project has developed a scanning system using a single channel photometer cooled by liquid nitrogen ( hull et al .",
    "1994 ; hogg et al .",
    "it has enough sensitivity and field of view , but their scanning mechanism is not easy to construct and its cooling system needs frequent hands .",
    "recently , thermal infrared imagers without cooling parts sensitive enough to detect thin clouds have become available , and by combining these with some panoramic optics , now we can easily see the whole sky in thermal infrared .",
    "this idea was presented by mallama & deganan ( 2002 ) , and a similar one was developed by the apache point observatory .",
    "however , it requires stability and reliability for these systems to be put into practical use for a robotic telescope where no operator or engineer is onsite .",
    "we developed an infrared cloud monitor system that is successful for this use .",
    "owing to this , we have achieved unmanned automated observation at the magnum observatory at haleakala since 2001 ( kobayashi et al . 2003 ; 2004 ) .",
    "the magnum ( ulticolor ctive alactic clei onitoring ) project newly built a 2-m optical - infrared telescope at the university of hawaii s haleakala observatory site on the hawaiian island of maui , and has been monitoring many active galaxies and quasars in optical and near - infrared wavebands for more than several years ( yoshii et al .",
    "we study their structure and physical environment , and finally , determine the cosmological parameters by an entirely original method ( kobayashi et al .",
    "1998 ; yoshii 2002 ) .",
    "the other distinct challenge of this project is to achieve unmanned automated observation .",
    "we aimed at and have achieved months - long automated observation without anyone being required at the observatory .    in order to fulfill our purpose",
    ", our whole - sky infrared cloud monitor has many salient characteristics for automated operation .",
    "it can see almost whole - sky at once in a thermal infrared waveband with sensitivity high enough to detect thin clouds .",
    "it is weather - proof , and has been outdoors under hard weather conditions on the top of a high - altitude mountain , about 3,000 m high , for many years .",
    "furthermore , the raw whole - sky images are immediately reduced to apparent emissivity maps of the cloud which will be classified into several ranks of observational condition .",
    "these maps and ranks can be referred to by our automated observing system and the remote watchers in japan .",
    "they are also referred to by many facilities other than the magnum telescope at haleakala .",
    "following our success , systems using copies of our design have been used at several observatories and sites such as mauna kea in hawaii ( takato et al .",
    "2002 ) , atacama in chile , and okayama and kiso in japan .",
    "these attract site studies for new observatories where it is difficult for people to remain for any length of time .    in this paper , we describe our infrared cloud monitor system , breaking down into its design , its hardware contents , its data analysis software , and its performance and statistical data . the main instrument design and its components including the thermal imager , reflecting optics , and data acquisition system are described in @xmath2 [ system ] . in @xmath2 [ software ] , the analysis software that detects clouds and evaluates the whole - sky condition is described .",
    "the performance in some respects in operating the magnum observatory is presented and discussed in @xmath2 [ performance ] .",
    "finally , the weather trends seen in our accumulated whole - sky condition data over four years are discussed in @xmath2 [ weather_trends ] . +",
    "figure [ sysicm ] shows a schematic diagram of the magnum infrared cloud monitor .",
    "the outdoor hardware of the system is to the left of the figure .",
    "there are two aspherical convex mirrors with cassegrain - like alignment .",
    "a blackbody reference plate for calibration is installed where the camera can see it near the edge of its field of view .",
    "all electrical devices , thermal imager , signal converter for the output signal of the imager , shutter , and thermometer circuit for the blackbody reference plate , are attached under the primary mirror and surrounded by an aluminum - pipe housing whose ceiling is the primary mirror . on the central hole of the primary mirror",
    "is installed a diamond window which is transparent to thermal infrared and prevents water from dripping into the housing .",
    "photographs of the outdoor hardware are shown in figures [ magicm ] and [ weath1 ] .",
    "it is about 80 cm in height and about 35 cm in diameter .",
    "the data observed by the outdoor hardware are acquired by a linux pc , illustrated on the lower right of figure [ sysicm ] .",
    "the pc controls the shutter with a digital i / o board , and also triggers data acquisition of images and temperatures .",
    "the controlling and data - acquiring software , as well as analysis software , are always working and getting sets of the data including whole - sky raw images every one or two minutes throughout the night .",
    "the output data are directed to various types of software through a lan in the magnum observatory that includes the main manager of the observatory , the real - time scheduler or selector of target astronomical objects , and the information - collecting server for image headers of astronomical observations .",
    "the specifications of our infrared cloud monitor are listed in table [ speicm ] .",
    "owing to the uncooled thermal imager and reflecting optics that widen the camera field of view , we can obtain almost whole - sky images in thermal infrared .",
    "this hardware alignment , a cassegrain - like mirror system above an aluminum - pipe housing containing the thermal imager and electronic parts , has a significant advantage in that the outdoor system becomes compact and is waterproof .",
    "the only movable component in the system is a shutter , the  pronter magnetic e/100 \" , which works both as a shield against the sunlight during daytime and as a flat - fielding plate for image reduction .",
    "the main hardware components of our infrared cloud monitor are the thermal imager , the reflecting optics , and the data acquisition system , the details of which are described individually in the next subsections .",
    "+      the uncooled infrared imager that is sensitive in the @xmath3 waveband is one of the key components of our cloud monitor . in order to see high - altitude clouds with good visibility , or to detect the thermal emission of clouds standing out against the dark background of cold space , we need to select a waveband",
    "in which the atmosphere is highly transparent .",
    "there are two wavebands satisfying this requirement : one is the @xmath4 @xmath5 m band , and the other is the @xmath6 @xmath5 m band .",
    "so far as we use only one waveband and can not measure cloud temperature , the @xmath6 @xmath5 m band is better to estimate cloud emissivity .",
    "this is because this wavelength is around the flat - top part of the blackbody radiation of the clouds and ground , and flux from the clouds in this band is less dependent on temperatures than in the @xmath4 @xmath5 m band .",
    "we use an amber sentinel camera commercially produced by the amber a. raytheon co. in 1997 .",
    "this imager has an uncooled bolometer array of 320@xmath7240 pixels for its detector , and is sensitive enough to detect thin cirrus clouds in thermal infrared .",
    "it outputs both an analog signal of ntsc standard and digital signals of 12-bit depth with a frame rate of 30 hz .",
    "the specifications of the imager are tabulated in table [ sentinel ] .",
    "the camera has an automatically offset flat - fielding function .",
    "it compensates for pix - to - pix scatter of bias and dark current signals that depend heavily on the temperature of the imager .",
    "this calibration is necessary for a quick look at raw images and is recommended every several minutes ; calibration can be triggered by pc through an rs232c interface .",
    "however , we do this calibration less frequently , and take integrated images of a closed shutter plate for more precise compensation ( see  [ reduction ] ) .",
    "several cautions are in order here .",
    "some imagers could not take clear images in a cold environment , since their detector outputs are reduced outside the operation range .",
    "generally , outputs of uncooled bolometers significantly change due to a large change of thermal background , because they are surrounded by internal parts of ambient temperature .",
    "imagers being optimized for use at room temperature have relatively narrow operation ranges , and sometimes have the problem under low temperature environment .",
    "our imager displayed this defect in winter in japan or at the haleakala site , so we asked the company to tune the electric circuit of the imager in colder environments .",
    "moreover , we resistively heated the imager up to about room temperature at night to increase the thermal background signals from the imager itself .    incidentally , the imager cost as much as $ 40,000 when we developed our cloud monitor .",
    "recently , products with various specifications have been made available by many manufacturers at lower costs .",
    "+        the cassegrain - like reflecting optics is another key component of our infrared cloud monitor .",
    "the camera s field of view is not large enough to cover the whole sky , and must be expanded by other optics .",
    "germanium crystals are generally used for the lenses of these thermal imagers because it is well transparent in thermal infrared .",
    "fish - eye lenses made of this material , however , are not commercially available , and are also hard to develop or fabricate without a great deal of expenditure .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to use some kind of convex mirror system .",
    "for the fundamental shape of the mirrors , we based ours on the particular aspherical ones introduced by chahl & srinivasan ( 1997 ) .",
    "when we look into these types of mirrors along with their optical axis , the appearance of the reflected field is not radially deformed ; they preserve a linear relationship between the apparent angle from the image center and the real radial angle from the field center .",
    "a simple spherical mirror produces a radially compressed image toward the image edge ; the more distant from the image center we see through the mirror , the more radially compressed the objects appear .",
    "now , we align the camera with the surface of a mirror using polar coordinates as shown in figure [ opt_design1 ] , where the lens node of the imager is located at the origin , and the mirror surface should be adjusted by the revolution of the function @xmath8 around @xmath9 axis . here",
    ", @xmath10 is an angle of line - of - sight with the @xmath9 axis in the camera field , and @xmath11 is an angle of line - of - sight with the @xmath9 axis in the negative direction in the real field that is seen through both the camera and the mirror . according to chahl & srinivasan",
    ", @xmath11 would proportionally correspond to @xmath10 if @xmath8 is given by @xmath12^{-1/\\kappa } } \\;\\;\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the distance between the mirror and @xmath14 along the @xmath9 axis , @xmath15 $ ] is the initial angle of the mirror , in other words , a half of the vertex angle , and @xmath16 relates to the proportionality constant @xmath17 between @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which means field widening power , as @xmath18 if we place the mirror with the convex side upwards and direct the camera to look down on the mirror vertically , we can see the sky at zenith angle between @xmath19 and @xmath20 in degrees : @xmath21 \\right)\\;\\;\\;.       \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a circular image of the whole - sky is obtained by setting @xmath22 as half the shorter angle of the rectangular field - of - view of the imager .",
    "chahl & srinivasan ( 1997 ) also suggested a two - mirror system of cassegrain - like alignment , in which the aspherical shape introduced above is used as a primary mirror and a cone - like shape is used as secondary , as shown in figure [ opt_design2 ] .",
    "here , the secondary with half a vertex angle of @xmath23 is placed with its surface facing the imager , which is equivalent to the configuration in figure [ opt_design1 ] with @xmath24 .",
    "the section of its surface is triangular , equivalent to @xmath25 , which means the surface has no field widening power .",
    "the section of primary mirror surface should be drawn similarly to figure [ opt_design1 ] , but in an @xmath26 coordinate system , in which @xmath27 is symmetrical with @xmath14 about the section of the secondary surface .",
    "if @xmath23 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are properly optimized , the light coming from the zenith ( @xmath30 ) can reach the imager , avoiding the secondary mirror by way of @xmath28 and the secondary vertex .",
    "then , the entire sky including the zenith can be seen .",
    "however , though the idea is very attractive , we found a serious astigmatism aberration in these optics which is mostly derived from the cone - shape of the secondary .",
    "when seen from above along with the optical axis , there is no curvature along with sagittal directions on the completely cone - shaped surface , while its curvature exists tangentially .",
    "this aberration becomes extremely large if we use an imager with a large lens aperture .",
    "a combination of our 71 mm - aperture lens imager and 240 mm - diameter primary mirror , being restricted by our manufacturing capacity , results in a point - spread - function ( psf ) size over one millimeter on the detector , which corresponds to 10 degrees in the sky .",
    "we therefore did not completely follow the original two - mirror system scheme , and improved it to upgrade image quality at the cost of view near zenith and some amount of sensitivity . in detail",
    ", we significantly flattened the vertex angle of the cone - shaped secondary mirror to reduce its tangential curvature .",
    "next , we introduced an aspherical shape similar to that of the secondary mirror in figure [ opt_design1 ] , so that it also has a field - widening power to some extent , similar to a primary mirror . in fact",
    ", @xmath27 projected by the section of this type of secondary surface does not strictly converge at one point , but its effect on the field deformation was found to be ignored .",
    "moreover , we adopted a smaller primary mirror hole to reduce the shadow area in the image center , and also to extend the focal depth . because the primary hole squeezes the imager s lens aperture , the decline in sensitivity is compensated by frame integration .    as a result of these improvements",
    ", we adopted the parameters listed for the  improved \" model in table [ sys_mirror ] .",
    "the parameters determined following the original idea of figure [ opt_design2 ] are also listed as a reference for the  original \" model .",
    "our  improved \" model gives a shadow circle with a radius of 11 degrees at the zenith .",
    "however , the area is not critical for us because the magnum telescope rarely observes objects around the zenith because of the sparse distribution of celestial coordinates of our targets , and because of some operational restrictions of our telescope .",
    "most remarkable is that the image resolution was dramatically increased in our  improved \" model .",
    "figure [ spt ] shows the spot - diagrams of ray - traced images for both  original \" and  improved \" models .",
    "the specifications of the two models are also tabulated in table [ spe_mirror ] .",
    "the  improved \" model decreases the size of the point - spread - functions ( psfs ) by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "there remain some astigmatism and field curvature in our  improved \" model , but the psf size is within a few pixels over almost the entire field of view .",
    "+      the surfaces of the mirrors were shaped by diamond turning on brass that is easily worked and goes well with gold coating .",
    "using an ultra - precise , computerized , numerically controlled ( cnc ) turning machine , we obtained a surface roughness of about 20 nm in rms , which is fine enough as a mirror at a wavelength of @xmath31 m .",
    "the surface was plated with solid gold , containing 5 % cobalt , with a thickness of 2 @xmath32 m .",
    "finally , a physical vapor sapphire was deposited on the surface with a thickness of 0.2 @xmath32 m for protection .",
    "the surface reflectivity is about 95 % and no serious degradation has been seen in an outdoor operation of five years .",
    "for the first attempt to process the mirror surface , we tried an aluminum - based alloy plated by electroless nickel , and coated gold on the surface .",
    "but we found that the gold coat degraded in a few months exposure to air .",
    "the pinholes in the nickel plating might make water erode the aluminum base rapidly .    on the central hole of the primary mirror",
    "was placed a chemical vapor - deposited ( cvd ) diamond plate with a thickness of 0.2 mm and transparency of about 80 % at @xmath33 with no coat .",
    "a germanium plate processed with anti - reflection coating on both top and bottom and protective coating on the top could also work in some environments , and has been used in similar systems at several sites such as mauna kea in hawaii and atacama in chile .",
    "however , during our test operation in tokyo , japan , the upper surface of the germanium window degraded in a few months .",
    "we guess that rain in tokyo is very acidic , which might enhance degradation of the protective coating . +      the thermal imager , the amber sentinel camera , outputs images with analog signals of ntsc standard as well as digital signals of 12-bit parallel channels at the rate of 30-frames per second .",
    "we use digital output because an analog signal of 8-bit depth data loses the lower 4 bits of original signal that is much larger than the noise signal of one or two analog - to - digital units ( adus ) , and is difficult to restore by frame integration afterwards .    for each data bit , together with synchronizing clocks for frame acquisition ,",
    "the digital signals are single - ended transistor - transistor - logic ( ttl ) standard .",
    "we convert these signals to differential signals of rs-422 standard level by a hand - made digital electrical circuit with ic in order to transmit the signals to a pc about 15 m away from the outdoor system .",
    "this is because the ttl signals are too delicate in a noisy environment to send more than several tens of centimeters at a high data rate .",
    "the signals are acquired by a linux pc using a digital frame - grabber board , pc - dig produced by coreco inc .",
    "it can grab digital data of 12 parallel channels at the rate of 4.6 mega - bytes per second for our imager , and its driver for linux os is supported by the company .",
    "we integrate the images for 5 seconds , corresponding to 150 frames , to increase the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "integration for more than 10 seconds is not favorable because the whole - sky images of clouds are often blurred by migrations of clouds .    for each acquisition of the whole - sky image",
    ", we take shutter images immediately before and after it . in addition",
    ", the temperature of the blackbody reference plate is measured at the same time .",
    "the sets of data are acquired about every one or two minutes while the elevation of the sun is below 15 degrees .",
    "we cease the operation almost entirely during the daytime , in case direct rays of sunlight degrade the imager detector .",
    "each whole - sky image is processed immediately after acquisition with the shutter images , the temperature of the blackbody reference , and some calibration data measured in advance .",
    "figure [ kumored ] illustrates how we reduce a raw whole - sky image into the apparent emissivity map of the clouds .",
    "first , offset flat fielding for the pix - to - pix pattern is done by subtracting the average of the two shutter images obtained before and after the incident exposure of the whole - sky image .",
    "the automatic offset flat fielding by the camera is convenient for snapshot images , but not complete for our frame - integrated whole - sky images .",
    "we can do similar calibration with a higher signal - to - noise ratio using the frame - integrated shutter images .",
    "next , background signals from the optics and the interior of the imager are subtracted .",
    "there are two types of components of background signal : flat - offset components and spatial - pattern components .",
    "they differ from each other with varying internal and environmental temperatures , and have to be subtracted separately .",
    "the flat - offset background component includes bias and dark current signals of the detector along with thermal radiation from the interior of the imager and the optics , which should be compensated for each whole - sky image .",
    "subtraction of the shutter image from the whole - sky image does not work well because the surface brightness of the shutter and the thermal background from the optics vary independently .",
    "the flat - offset value of the background signal @xmath34 on the whole - sky image is calculated from the temperature @xmath35 of the blackbody reference plate and its signal @xmath36 on the incident whole - sky image as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the planck function for temperature @xmath35 , and @xmath39 is the signal - to - surface brightness ratio measured beforehand .",
    "the units of @xmath34 and @xmath36 are adu .",
    "we subtract the single value of @xmath34 from those of all pixels in the incident whole - sky image .",
    "there remains a spatial - pattern background component , which mainly originates in the baffle of the reflecting optics and the atmosphere .",
    "the pattern of this type of background is radially symmetrical and almost stable on clear nights .",
    "we therefore prepare a template whole - sky image for a clear night beforehand .",
    "the template image should be acquired when the sky is certain to be clear and reduced up to compensating the flat - offset background .",
    "we subtract the template image from all whole - sky images .",
    "now that the background signals are subtracted , we calibrate the signals in the whole - sky image into a surface brightness value using the signal - to - surface brightness ratio @xmath39 .",
    "one can determine the value of @xmath39 in laboratory by exposing the blackbody targets of different temperatures , or can determine it at the observatory site by exposing both clear sky and a black object of ambient temperature at once .",
    "note that the value of @xmath39 is dependent on zenith angle , mainly because of vignetting on the aperture of the camera lens .",
    "we should therefore measure @xmath39 for several zenith angles and using a function fitted to them .",
    "figure [ gain ] shows the data of @xmath39 measured for our system at the magnum observatory site .",
    "finally , the surface brightness @xmath40 in the image is converted to the apparent emissivity @xmath41 of the clouds at a 10 @xmath32 m waveband , which is related to @xmath40 as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the plank function for the cloud temperature @xmath44 . according to the average annual air temperature of 296 k at sea level in maui island and lapse rate of @xmath45 @xmath46 for standard atmosphere ( coesa , u.s . standard atmosphere 1976 ) , the expected ambient temperature at 10,000-m altitude above haleakala observatory should be about 240 k. we therefore calculate @xmath41 assuming ( hereafter fixing ) the temperature of @xmath47 k as representative of high - altitude clouds or cirrus .",
    "note that @xmath41 includes reflection efficiency of a cloud as well as absorption efficiency , and in @xmath40 , there is a significant amount of reflected emission by the cloud which originates in the surface of the ground or sea .",
    "this means we can not convert the apparent emissivity @xmath41 simply to optical depth , which relates to actual absorption efficiency .",
    "however , particularly for high - altitude clouds , it is reported that a large amount of emission still originates thermally in clouds themselves ( platt & stephens 1980 ) .",
    "figure [ cloudimage ] shows the whole - sky cloud emissivity maps obtained and processed under various sky conditions .",
    "it is very convenient for a remote watcher from japan as well as at the haleakala site to see the whole - sky cloud emissivity maps on the internet .",
    "however , our main objective in operating the magnum observatory is automated observation in real - time consideration of weather conditions .",
    "we therefore developed software to detect clouds from the whole - sky cloud emissivity maps and evaluate observational conditions from them ( @xmath2 [ acd ] and @xmath2 [ whole - sky ] ) .",
    "+      to determine whether clouds exist or not in a certain part of the sky , it is important to measure both the average and the standard deviation value of the emissivities in a small area in about that direction , rather than to refer to just one pixel value . here , two elements limit sensitivity : one is variation in zero emissivity level caused by residual thermal background signal , and the other is pix - to - pix noise .",
    "the empirical value of the former for our system is about @xmath48 , which is considerably large compared to those of thin clouds .",
    "this mainly comes from the residual pattern of the background radiation that is difficult to subtract completely from a single template whole - sky image . also , humidity has some correlation with residual background .",
    "the latter limit for the sensitivity is about @xmath49 as a noise equivalent signal of the image , which is much less than the former .",
    "thin clouds are easy to detect by their spatial fluctuations of emissivity rather than by emissivity values themselves .",
    "we therefore divide a whole - sky cloud emissivity map into 90 sub - areas , each being 10 degrees in elevation and 20 degrees in azimuth . for each sub - area",
    ", we categorize the cloud condition into several levels using the average emissivity @xmath50 and the rms emissivity @xmath51 calculated for the area .",
    "figure [ pointsky ] shows the @xmath52 versus @xmath41 diagram on which each sub - area can be evaluated . a sub - area",
    "is evaluated as  clear \" only when both @xmath53 and @xmath54 , otherwise regarded as being covered by some clouds . except for ",
    "clear \" , the sub - area is evaluated into  thin \" ,  thick \" , or  rain \" when @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "the condition of  rain \" means that the surface brightness is larger than that for blackbody of 300 k , and the mirror system is possibly wet due to rainfall or moisture , though the direct detection of rainfall should be done by rain sensors .",
    "each sub - area is given a level of 0 for  clear \" , 1 for  thin \" , 2 for  thick \" , or 3 for  rain \" in order to calculate whole - sky cloud condition from statistics over all sub - areas ( see next subsection ) .",
    "the main cause preventing detection of even thinner clouds is the residual pattern of the thermal background on the whole - sky emissivity maps , which increases the rms value of emissivities even in a small sub - area .",
    "this could be improved if a relation between the radial pattern and the temperature of the reflecting optics is contributed or the temperature of the reflecting optics is regulated .",
    "more fundamentally , we are soon going to improve the design of the reflecting optics so that there would be no vignetting objects in the optical pass .",
    "+      to determine whether the sky allows observation or not and what type of observation is best to execute , we evaluate the whole - sky cloud condition using statistics over sub - area values calculated and labeled in @xmath2 [ acd ] .",
    "we classify the whole - sky cloud condition into five types :  clear \" ,  thinorpartial \" ,  medium \" ,  cloudy \" , and  rainy \" .",
    "first , for safety , we strictly exclude conditions when there are many sub - areas of  rain \" .",
    "figure [ allsky_rain ] shows classifications of whole - sky cloud condition on the average over sub - area values vs.  rain \" sub - area coverage plane .",
    "in so far as the  rain \" sub - area coverage is larger than 10 % , the whole - sky condition is evaluated as  medium \" ,  cloudy \" , or ",
    "rainy \" , and we do not start any type of observation .",
    "next , when the  rain \" sub - area coverage is less than 10 % , we classify whole - sky cloud conditions into five types , as in figure [ allsky_cloud ] . here , cloud coverage includes both  thin \" and  thick \" sub - areas .",
    "the whole - sky cloud condition is evaluated as  clear \" only at the origin of figure [ allsky_cloud ] , which means all sub - areas are  clear \" . except for ",
    "clear \" , whole - sky cloud condition is classified as  thinorpartial \" ,  medium \" , or  cloudy \" , according to the cloud coverage and mean sub - area level .",
    "the classifications above have mainly been working successfully , though they are empirical and somewhat inelegant .",
    "our cloud monitor was located at the haleakala site and began to give whole - sky cloud emissivity maps when magnum observatory started its telescope operation in august 2000 . then , an automated monitoring observation of active galaxies with the cloud monitor was put into practical use in early 2001 . after refinements of several months , we achieved fully automated astronomical observation for an entire night .",
    "now , we have continuous unmanned observation , except for maintenance every several months ( kobayashi et al . 2003 ; 2004 )    according to the whole - sky cloud condition evaluated by the cloud monitor , our automated observing system decides whether observation is possible or not .",
    "when the whole - sky cloud condition is either  clear \" or  thinorpartial \" , the observing system opens the dome slit and commands observation . when the whole - sky cloud condition is  cloudy \" or  rainy \" , the observing system closes the dome slit , and carries out no observation . when the whole - sky cloud condition is  medium \" , the observing system maintains the ongoing operation .",
    "moreover , according to the whole - sky cloud condition , we also determine what type of observation should be executed . if the condition is  clear \" , which can be regarded as a photometric sky , all types of observations are possible .",
    "if the condition is  thinorpartial \" , certain observations that are delicate under cloud extinction are restricted ; observations such as standard star calibration , relative photometry between several separate fields , or imaging of faint objects are allowed only in  clear \" conditions . instead , differential photometry between the bright objects in the same field of view is permitted in  thinorpartial \" conditions because it is barely affected by extinction fluctuations .",
    "the whole - sky cloud condition and status of the sub - area at which the telescope is pointing are recorded in the fits header of observed images .",
    "the whole - sky emissivity maps are also archived so that we can check the quality of the observed astronomical data when we analyze them .",
    "the cloud monitor has mainly been working stably until now , except for several months of trouble with the frame grabber board .",
    "regular maintenance includes wiping the dust on the mirror and shipping whole - sky images to japan when we visit the site every several months .    in the following two sections ( @xmath2 [ defence_rain ] and @xmath2 [ det_phot ] ) , we present and discuss performance of our cloud monitor , comparing it with some other weather sensors and photometric data .",
    "+      the most primitive function required of our cloud monitor is to determine whether the sky allows observation or not . when the sky becomes cloudy",
    ", the cloud monitor should close the dome slit before rain falls .",
    "it also should stop meaningless and risky opening of the dome when the sky is still covered by thick clouds .",
    "table [ sky_rain ] shows the frequency distribution of various weather conditions over four years from two different weather - sensing systems including the whole - sky cloud monitor and the rain sensor .",
    "note that the rain sensor directly senses rain drops by means of changes in the resistivity of the electrical circuit , while the cloud monitor only inspects surface brightness of the sky image .",
    "the percentages of rain - sensor output in the night are 85.8 % for  dry \" and 14.2 % for  rain \" .",
    "this table indicates that a combination of  cloudy \" and  rainy \" comprises 96 % of  rain \" , i.e. , rain drops can be avoided by this high probability from such a combined cloud condition .",
    "the remaining 4 % probability corresponds to a situation in which the rain sensor catches rain drops while the output from the cloud monitor is  clear \" ,  thinorpartial \" or  medium \" , and would decrease further if acquisition of whole - sky data were carried out more frequently , because the approach of moisture is sometimes very rapid .",
    "the humidity sensor , however , usually helps to catch the moisture on its way up to the observatory .",
    "+      the next important function required of the cloud monitor is to determine whether the night is photometric or not .",
    "the flux calibration of active galaxies using reference stars or standard stars in different telescope directions often fails if we are uncertain whether the sky is entirely clear .",
    "reliability of the whole - sky condition  clear \" can be estimated from statistics of accumulated standard star flux data , because these have been observed quickly while the whole - sky is  clear \" .",
    "table [ sig_zerop ] presents several statistical values of our standard star observations over two years while the instrumental throughput was relatively stable .",
    "columns ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are the waveband and effective wavelength , respectively . column",
    "( 3 ) is the number of observations .",
    "the standard deviation of the fluxes over all observations @xmath58 for each band is given in column ( 4 ) , and the average over individual photometric errors @xmath59err@xmath60 is given in column ( 5 ) . nominal extinction value for unit airmass @xmath61 , measured by intensive observations of standard stars on a few nights ,",
    "are shown in column ( 6 ) .",
    "the linear trend of flux decreasing with time during the period , derived from changes in telescope throughput , is corrected .",
    "airmass correction for elevation in each observation is done with a constant value in the table .",
    "the photometric errors @xmath59err@xmath60 are so small that they contribute little to @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , the scatter @xmath58 mainly contains the day - to - day changes in extinction by the atmosphere or clouds .    converting @xmath58 and @xmath61 to flux ratio , we show @xmath62 against wavelength @xmath63 in figure [ std ] .",
    "the vertical bars with inverted triangles on top are @xmath58 , being corrected for @xmath59err@xmath60 .",
    "filled squares are @xmath61 .",
    "the solid line is linear fit to the filled squares except for the @xmath64-band which is particularly affected by water vapor .",
    "the line shows wavelength - dependence of @xmath65 , which is consistent with a typical trend of a mixture of rayleigh - scattering by molecules and mie - scattering by small aerosols in the atmosphere ( cox 2000 ) .",
    "a similar linear wavelength - dependence is seen in @xmath58 in the optical , and should be dominated by daily or seasonal variation in the extinction by the atmosphere . on the other hand , @xmath58 at longer wavelengths beyond",
    "the @xmath66-band is near constant , regardless of wavelength - dependence of @xmath61 .",
    "we consider that this flat component of @xmath58 could include variation in extinction by clouds missed by our cloud monitor , because the size of typical cloud particles is on the order of ten microns and their wavelength - dependence of extinction is white at a few microns or shorter .",
    "therefore , photometric errors caused by extinction of the clouds are restricted to within a few percent .",
    "bradley et al . ( 2006 ) overviewed meteorological characteristics at haleakala with respect to many types of weather data , such as humidity , temperature , wind speed , and cloud coverage . however , their analysis is based on compilation of various records with fairly large spatial and time resolution , including those taken by satellites .",
    "our whole - sky cloud conditions are more straightforward and systematic , because our conditions are completely based on direct measurements of clouds that are projected onto the sky above the observatory .",
    "table [ log_allsky ] shows the proportions of whole - sky cloud conditions averaged monthly between january 2001 and december 2005 .",
    "several conditions in early 2001 are combined because of test operation of analysis software .",
    "a total of 668,063 whole - sky images for 1,601 nights give the statistics in the table .",
    "figure [ weather_freq ] presents the relative frequencies of the whole - sky cloud conditions combined over the data in table [ log_allsky ] .",
    "the percentage of each condition is an average over the data weighted by the number of nights in which the data were obtained .",
    "the monthly percentage for combined conditions between january 2001 and july 2001 is divided into respective conditions , according to their average proportions after august 2001 .",
    "it should be noted that despite  clear \" and  thinorpartial \" conditions , observations were sometimes impossible due to other weather warnings such as high humidity and strong wind .",
    "moreover , observations were not carried out when the wet sensor warned that a dome was not dried out after rainfall or moisture .",
    "concerning haleakala , more than 50@xmath160 % of all night time is near photometric , and in about 75 % , it is feasible to execute particular observations .",
    "haleakala is therefore not worse than mauna kea where the observable sky rate is 60@xmath180 % as one of the best locations for optical and near - infrared observations in the northern hemisphere , along with good access .",
    "next , figure [ monthly_weather ] shows the monthly average relative frequency of the whole - sky cloud condition .",
    "clear seasonal cycles over a year can be seen ; there are high observable rates in summer and winter , and low rates in early spring and late autumn , in agreement with bradley et al .",
    "it has generally been said that there are a dry summer season and rainy winter season in hawaii .",
    "our data , however , demonstrates that midwinter is not very bad at haleakala , as far as sky condition is concerned .",
    "we developed an infrared cloud monitor weather system that has been most successfully supporting an unmanned robotic telescope .",
    "it sees almost whole - sky in thermal infrared with no field deformation , sensitively detects thin high - altitude clouds , automatically evaluates sky conditions , and withstands outdoor environments for several months without maintenance .",
    "owing to this system , the magnum observatory has been achieving unmanned automated observation at haleakala for more than four years .",
    "its evaluation of the whole - sky cloud condition being photometric , observable , or non - observable seems to be mainly successful .",
    "it also proves that for optical and near - infrared observations , haleakala is a site comparable to mauna kea .",
    "copies of our cloud monitor are now used for many similar systems at sites all around the world , including the atacama region in the northern part of chile .",
    "the development of our cloud monitor was supported by the advanced technology center , national astronomical observatory of japan .",
    "we are grateful to the technical center of nagoya university for our use of their ultra - precise turning machine .",
    "we thank h. takami and n. takato for helpful discussion and advice on development .",
