    "when we finally arrive at the complete effective field theory that faithfully reproduces qcd in the low - energy regime relevant for nuclear physics , we will be able to answer some fundamental questions .",
    "in addition , to being able to describe inelastic processes , such as @xmath0 , in the same framework as elastic processes and the framework with which the nuclear energy levels are computed to high accuracy , we will know how such processes depend upon the fundamental constants of nature , the strong interaction mass - scale , @xmath1 , and the masses of the quarks , @xmath2 .",
    "a small but significant step has been taken in this direction by a recent calculation of the behavior of the two nucleon systems as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "there are three good reasons for understanding such behavior .",
    "the first reason is intellectual curiosity . if we believe that we completely understand the strong interaction we should be in a position to address this issue .",
    "the second reason is to put constraints on physics beyond the standard model .",
    "there are hints that the constants of the standard model , such as @xmath3 and @xmath2 , may be time - dependent  @xcite .",
    "the third and perhaps the most practical reason is that the @xmath2-dependence of nuclear properties and reaction rates needs to be known in order to extrapolate lattice - qcd calculations from the unphysical values that will be used in present simulations and in those of the near future , down to those of nature . for the foreseeable future lattice qcd calculations will be performed with unphysically large quark masses simply due to the fact that the time required to perform the simulations increases as one reduces the @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , effective field theory ( eft ) will play a key role in any future lattice qcd program , as it will only be through matching onto the appropriate field theory that lattice qcd will be able to make predictions of physical observables .",
    "this is true , of course , only until such a time when such observables can be computed directly with the physical values of the quark masses .",
    "the link between eft and data has been and continues to be very strong , with data constraining the finite number of counterterms that appear at any given order in the eft expansion . however ,",
    "eft calculations are being performed at sufficiently high orders so that in some cases the number of counterterms is greater than the number of observables , and lattice - qcd will be the only way to further improve the calculation . at this time",
    "constraints are being placed on linear combinations of the gasser - leutwyler coefficients , the @xmath4 , through partially - quenched qcd ( pqqcd ) simulations  @xcite .    for processes involving multiple nucleons",
    "it is convenient to describe different momentum regimes with different eft s .",
    "if one is dealing with processes in which all momenta are less than the pion mass , @xmath5 , it proves to be useful to use the pionless eft , @xmath6 , while for processes involving momenta greater than @xmath5 one must use a pionful theory .",
    "in the kinematic regime where @xmath8 we can construct an eft to describe the interactions of multiple nucleons and photons quite simply  @xcite . the fact that there is a bound state near threshold in the @xmath9 coupled - channels , and a pole on the second - sheet near threshold in the @xmath10 channel means that at least one operator in the eft lagrange density must be treated non - perturbatively .",
    "one is free to choose which operators are resummed , and this will be defined in the power - counting associated with the eft .",
    "there are no explicit @xmath11 s , @xmath12 s or other hadrons that can be produced in the low - energy collisions .",
    "as @xmath6 is only applicable in the very - low energy regime , chiral symmetry is not a good symmetry , however isospin is a good symmetry .",
    "the only input into the construction of @xmath6 is lorentz invariance , electromagnetic gauge invariance , baryon number conservation and the approximate isospin symmetry , the breaking of which is included perturbatively .",
    "the strong interactions between two nucleons are described by a lagrange density @xmath13^\\dagger n^t p^j n \\",
    "+ \\ ... \\ \\ \\ , \\label{eq : strongnopi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is a spin - isospin projector , and the ellipses denote operators involving more powers of the external energy .",
    "it is clear that there is a correspondence between the operators in eq .",
    "( [ eq : strongnopi ] ) and the coefficients in the effective range ( er ) expansion of the scattering amplitude .",
    "this lagrange density is explicitly galilean invariant and relativistic corrections can be included in perturbation theory straightforwardly  @xcite .",
    "further , it is straightforward to include the interactions in higher angular momentum channels , such as in the @xmath9 coupled channels  @xcite .",
    "if the only thing that had been accomplished was to recover effective range theory from @xmath6 , nothing would have been achieved .",
    "however , @xmath6 is more than effective range theory . in @xmath6 one",
    "can systematically incorporate gauge fields , such as the photon and electroweak fields .",
    "in addition to interactions arising from gauging derivatives in the strong interactions , there are operators that are gauge - invariant by themselves . for instance , the lowest order ( lo ) gauge invariant operator that contributes to the deuteron quadrupole moment is @xmath15^\\dagger \\left[\\ n^t p_j n\\ \\right ] \\left(\\",
    "\\nabla^i\\nabla^j - { 1\\over n-1 } \\nabla^2\\delta^{ij}\\ \\right ) a_0 \\ \\ \\ , \\label{eq : quadct}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the time - component of the electromagnetic field .",
    "a computation of the deuteron quadrupole moment up to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) allows one to fit the coefficient @xmath17 .",
    "once this constant is determined other observables that receive contributions from this @xmath18 operator can be computed up to nlo  @xcite .",
    "the cross section for @xmath19 at energies relevant to big - bang nucleosynthesis provides an example of a high precision calculation in @xmath6 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nopi ] .",
    "this is a classic nuclear physics process in which meson - exchange currents play a significant role . from the @xmath6 point of view , where mesons are not an explicit degree of freedom , such contributions are included via local gauge - invariant four - nucleon - one - photon interactions ( e.g. with coefficient @xmath20 for @xmath19 ) . in this case the resonance saturation hypothesis works well , in so much as this local operator is saturated by one pion exchange ( ope ) , but in general this need not be the case .    .",

    "in addition to the well - known one - body contributions to the break - up , there is also a contribution from two - body interactions .",
    "butler , chen and kong  @xcite showed that only one constant , @xmath25 , is required to describe the two - body contribution in order to calculate the cross - section at the percent level .",
    "therefore , the question is where does one get @xmath25 from ? so far there have been three independent determinations of @xmath25 : from the @xmath26-decay of tritium in a hybrid eft , from an analysis of reactor data on @xmath27 break - up , and from an analysis of sno data  @xcite .",

    "an improved experimental determination of @xmath49 would be welcome .",
    "it was weinbergs pioneering efforts  @xcite in the early 1990 s that led to the field of eft in nuclear physics .",
    "he was attempting to construct an eft for nuclear processes and nuclei involving momentum all the way up to the chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath51 , and necessarily included the pion as a dynamical degree of freedom .",
    "the power - counting that he developed , known as weinberg power - counting ( w ) , involved performing a chiral expansion of the nucleon - nucleon potential using the same power - counting rules that apply in the meson and single nucleon sectors .",
    "the chirally expanded potential is then inserted into the schroedinger equation to determine observables , such as phase shifts .",
    "however , there is a formal problem with this power counting  @xcite in some of the scattering channels , particularly the @xmath10 channel . however , extensive phenomenological studies with w power - counting appear to be in good agreement with data  @xcite , where such comparisons are possible , and the formal problem appears to have little impact when a massive regulator is used with a mass scale that is not radically different from a few hundred mev .",
    "this problem led to ksw power - counting  @xcite in which the momentum independent four - nucleon operator is promoted to one lower order in the chiral expansion , and consequently pion exchanges are subleading order and treated in perturbation theory .",
    "this power - counting is formally consistent and gives renormalization group invariant amplitudes order - by - order in the power - counting . however ,",
    "fleming , mehen and stewart  @xcite ( fms ) showed that the scattering amplitude in the @xmath9 coupled channels diverges at nnlo at relatively small momenta and ksw power - counting fails .",
    "fms found that a contribution that remains large in the chiral limit destroys the convergence : it is the chiral limit of the tensor force that `` does the damage '' .",
    "recently , it was suggested that one should expand observables about the chiral limit  @xcite ( bbsvk power - counting ) .",
    "bbsvk power - counting has all the nice features of w and ksw counting : the chiral limit of the tensor force is resummed at lo along with the momentum and @xmath2 independent four - nucleon operator in the @xmath9 coupled channels , while pions are perturbative in the @xmath10 channel and in higher partial waves where analytic calculations are possible .",
    "as i mentioned previously , the phenomenology of w counting has been explored extensively .",

    "they argue that performing a chiral expansion of the current operators ( or whatever operator you are interested in ) and using wavefunctions generated by the best modern potentials ( `` best '' being defined as those with lowest @xmath71 in the two- and three - nucleon sectors ) should be equivalent to the formal eft expansion .",
