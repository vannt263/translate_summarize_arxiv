    "[ [ motivation ] ] motivation + + + + + + + + + +    the pagerank algorithm  @xcite is at the heart of one of the most popular web search engines .",
    "its basic idea is to use the graph structure of the web in order to assign to each webpage a score .",
    "basically , the pagerank score attributed to the webpages measures _ how often a given page would be visited by a random walker on the webgraph_. formally , let @xmath9 $ ] be the @xmath10 adjacency matrix of the webgraph , so that @xmath11 if there is a hyperlink from page @xmath12 to page @xmath13 and @xmath14 otherwise . for simplicity , we first assume that @xmath8 is irreducible , that is the webgraph is strongly connected .",
    "imagine that , when visiting a page @xmath12 , a websurfer chooses randomly the next webpage he / she will visit , among the pages referenced by page @xmath12 , with the uniform distribution .",
    "the trajectory of such a websurfer is a markov chain with transition matrix @xmath15 $ ] , given by @xmath16 in its most basic version , the pagerank vector @xmath17 , the entries of which give the pagerank score of the webpages , is simply defined as the stationary distribution of this random walk on the webgraph . thus @xmath17 is the invariant measure of the irreducible matrix @xmath18 , that is the unique stochastic vector such that @xmath19    however , the assumption that a websurfer makes uniform draws on the webgraph may seem unrealistic : a websurfer could have an a priori idea of the value of webpages , therefore favoring pages from reputed sites .",
    "the webrank may influence the reputation of the websites , and hence it may influence the behavior of the websurfers , which ultimately may influence the webrank . in this paper , we propose a simple model taking into account the mutual influence between webranking and websurfing .    [ [ the - t - pagerank ] ] the @xmath5-pagerank + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we consider a sequence of stochastic vectors , representing successive webranks , @xmath20 , which is defined inductively as follows .",
    "the current ranking @xmath21 induces a random walk on the webgraph .",
    "we assume that the websurfer moves from page @xmath12 to page @xmath13 with probability proportional to @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is an increasing function , the _ energy _ , and @xmath4 is a fixed positive parameter , the _",
    "temperature_. the websurfer s trajectory is therefore a markov chain with transition matrix @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is defined for all vector @xmath1 by @xmath26 the unique stationary distribution of this markov chain , i.e.  the invariant measure of the matrix @xmath24 , is then used to update the webrank . thus ,    [ eq : iter - ut ] @xmath27 where , for all vector @xmath1 , @xmath28 is the unique stochastic vector such that @xmath29    we call _",
    "@xmath5-pagerank _ the limit of @xmath21 when @xmath6 tends to infinity , if it exists , or a fixed point of the map @xmath30 .",
    "note that if @xmath31 is the uniform distribution , then @xmath32 is the classical pagerank .",
    "note also that the temperature @xmath5 measures the randomness of the process .",
    "if @xmath5 is small , with overwhelming probability , the websurfer shall move from page @xmath12 to one of the pages @xmath13 referenced by page @xmath12 of best rank , i.e.  maximizing @xmath33 , whereas if @xmath34 , the websurfer shall draw the next page among the pages @xmath13 referenced by the page @xmath12 , with the uniform distribution , as in the standard webrank definition . for @xmath34 , the @xmath5-pagerank coincides with the classical pagerank , because in this case @xmath35 .",
    "we also consider the simple iteration defined by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is an arbitrary stochastic vector . from a computational point of view , this is similar to the standard power method .",
    "[ [ main - results ] ] main results + + + + + + + + + + + +    our first main result shows that , if the temperature @xmath5 is sufficiently large , the @xmath5-pagerank exists , is unique and does not depend on the initial ranking .",
    "moreover , at least when the matrix @xmath8 is primitive , the generalized power algorithm  @xmath38 can be used to compute the @xmath5-pagerank .",
    "[ thm - intro : t - large ] if @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the lipschitz constant of the function @xmath23 , then the map @xmath30 given by  @xmath41 has a unique fixed point and the iterates  @xmath42 converge to it for every initial ranking .",
    "moreover , if @xmath8 is primitive and if @xmath5 is large enough , the iterates  @xmath38 converge to this unique fixed point for every initial ranking .    on the other hand , for small values of @xmath5 ,",
    "several @xmath5-pageranks exist , depending on the choice of the initial ranking . in some cases , the @xmath5-pagerank does nothing but validating the initial `` belief '' in the interest of pages given by the initial ranking .",
    "consider for instance the graph given in figure  [ fig : ex - self - validating ] with adjacency matrix @xmath43 , and let @xmath44 for all @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "let @xmath47 for an arbitrary small @xmath48 .",
    "then the iterates  @xmath49 and  @xmath38 converge to a @xmath5-pagerank close to @xmath50 , so the initial belief that the node  @xmath51 is more interesting than node  @xmath52 has strongly increased .",
    "our second main result shows that the existence of multiple @xmath5-pageranks is in fact a general feature , when @xmath5 is small enough .",
    "[ thm - intro : t - small ] if @xmath8 has at least two positive diagonal entries , then multiple @xmath5-pageranks exist for @xmath5 small enough .",
    "these two theorems follow respectively from theorems  [ thm : u_tau - fxpt - conv ] and  [ thm : f_tau - fxpt - conv ] , and from theorem  [ thm : mult - pt - fx ] , which are stated in a more general framework .",
    "we also study variants , bringing more realistic models of the behavior of the websurfer .",
    "this includes the presence of a `` damping factor '' , as in the standard definition of google s pagerank .",
    "we also consider the situation where the websurfer may take the webrank into account only when visiting a special page ( the search engine s webpage ) .",
    "similar conclusions apply to such variants .    [ [ method ] ] method + + + + + +    in order to analyze the map  @xmath41 , we first use tutte s matrix tree theorem  @xcite to express explicitly the invariant measure @xmath28 in term of the entries of @xmath25",

    "frobenius theory due to nussbaum  @xcite and krause  @xcite . to analyze the iteration  @xmath38 , we use two different approaches , which give convergence results under distinct technical assumptions .",
    "our first approach is to show that , if @xmath5 is sufficiently large , the map @xmath53 from the simplex to itself is a contraction for some norm .",
    "our second approach uses hilbert s projective metric and birkhoff s coefficient of ergodicity .",
    "[ [ related - work ] ] related work + + + + + + + + + + + +    several variants of the pagerank are considered in the literature in order to have a more realistic model of the behavior of the websurfers .",
    "for instance , some authors propose to introduce the browser s back button in the model  @xcite .",
    "other try to develop a topic - sensitive ranking by considering a surfer whose trajectory on the webgraph depends on his query or bookmarks  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the standard pagerank vector is simply the dominant left - eigenvector of some stochastic matrix .",
    "it has therefore received attention from the linear algebra community .",
    "current research concerns for instance efficient computation methods  @xcite , or sensitivity analysis  @xcite of the pagerank .    our use of transition probabilities proportional to @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is an energy function and @xmath5 the temperature , is reminiscent of simulated annealing algorithms . for a reference ,",

    "poveda made similar experiments on the larger matrix obtained by s. kamvar for a crawl of the union of the stanford and berkeley webs , with about 685000 nodes , for which , this time , the correspondence between some pages and the main urls is given .",
    "these experiments suggest that the @xmath5-pagerank obtained by the latter scheme , in which the temperature is gradually decreased , as illustrated in figure  ( b ) , might be of practical interest . a full experimentation , on a real scale web , is beyond the scope of the present paper .    as a concluding remark",
    ", we would like to point out that our results might be considered as an argument in favor of the thesis that one should not use pagerank type measures to assess quality .",
    "indeed , the validity of the classical pagerank relies on an ideal view of the web , in which the makers of pages are thought of as experts , creating hyperlinks only to pages they carefully examined , and judged by themselves to be of interest . in the real world , however , the web makers may be influenced by factors like reputation , to which the webrank participates . within the limits of the model ,",
    "our results show that pathological phenomena , like getting non unique and even not meaningful rankings , may occur in a self - referential world in which the websurfers would excessively rely on the web ranking , rather than on their own judgement .      , _ the @xmath5-pagerank : a model of self - validating effects of web surfing _ , in positive systems , vol .",

    "<S> pagerank is a ranking of the webpages used by the search engine google to determine in which order to display webpages . </S>",
    "<S> it measures how often a given webpage would be visited by a random surfer on the webgraph . </S>",
    "<S> it seems realistic that this ranking may influence the reputation of the webpages , and therefore the behavior of websurfers . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a simple model taking in account the mutual influence between webranking and websurfing .    </S>",
    "<S> we study this model by considering the following iteration on the set of stochastic row vectors : @xmath0 , where for all vector @xmath1 , @xmath2 is the unique invariant measure of a primitive stochastic matrix @xmath3 constructed from the adjacency matrix of the webgraph . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath4 is fixed and measures the confidence of the surfer in the ranking . </S>",
    "<S> we call @xmath5-pagerank the limit , if it exists , of these iterates when @xmath6 tends to infinity . we also consider the simple iteration defined by @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> we prove that , when @xmath5 is large enough , the fixed point of these iterations is unique and the convergence is global on the domain . </S>",
    "<S> but for small values of @xmath5 , at least when the matrix @xmath8 is positive , there are always several fixed points .    </S>",
    "<S> our analysis uses results of nonlinear perron  frobenius theory , hilbert projective metric and birkhoff s coefficient of ergodicity . </S>"
