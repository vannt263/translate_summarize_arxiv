    "interestingly , in latio@xmath2 a pressure - induced insulator - to - metal transition is observed for ti - o1 bond lengths just below 2  .",
    "@xcite this suggests that in latio@xmath0 the central chains within the slabs play a key role for the observed conducting properties of this compound .",
    "the other scenario for the interpretation of the pronounced asymmetric * e*@xmath41@xmath9 mir absorption band of latio@xmath0 is in terms of an optical signature of polaronic quasi - particles that are formed due to electron - phonon interaction.@xcite within a polaronic picture , the frequency position of the mir band is a measure of the polaronic binding energy and thus of the electron - phonon coupling strength .",
    "such a mir absorption band was found in several well - studied materials , like cuprates,@xcite manganites,@xcite and nickelates.@xcite also several titanium oxides show the characteristic absorption feature of polarons in the mir frequency range,@xcite and also for latio@xmath0 such a picture had been suggested to explain the pronounced mir band for * e*@xmath41@xmath9.@xcite    in the case of the manganites it was demonstrated that the mir band is very sensitive to the application of chemical or external pressure , see e.g. refs .  .",
    "in the case of doped manganites@xcite , pressure effects were attributed to tuning the strength of the electron - phonon coupling and thus the extent of the localization of the charges . in general , a broadening of the electronic bands , i.e. , an enhancement of the electron itineracy , and a stiffening of the lattice is expected upon pressure application . as a consequence , the electron - phonon coupling and",
    "therefore the polaronic binding energy should decrease .",
    "so a shift of the mir band to lower energies and an increase of the oscillator strength , indicating an enhanced delocalization of the charge carriers , are then expected .",

    "thus , also in the case of the titanate latio@xmath0 the doping dependence of the mir absorption band might be an important additional piece of information .",
    "further insight could be obtained by a detailed lineshape analysis of the absorption band .      near 15  gpa",

    "[ changes ] ) .",
    "these discontinuities are most probably related to the pressure - induced structural phase transition , which was observed at 18  gpa by x - ray diffraction measurements under more hydrostatic conditions.@xcite due to the large number of overlapping reflections , the high - pressure crystal structure could not be determined ; a reversible distortion of the low - pressure crystal structure was suggested.@xcite according to our optical data , the structural transition affects both the vibrational and electronic excitations of the system . above the phase transition , i.e. , for @xmath44  gpa , the broad * e*@xmath41@xmath11 excitation band",
