    "the direct search for weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) dark matter continues among the forefront efforts of experimental physics .",
    "the search is largely motivated by the continuing absence of a second positive signal with annual modulation confirming the result of the dama/@xmath0 experiment despite significantly improved detectors , and especially following the several recent reports of possible indirect observation of dark matter annihilation @xcite .",
    "direct search efforts , based on the detection of nuclear recoils in wimp - nucleon interactions , have been traditionally classified as to whether sensitive for the spin - independent or spin - dependent wimp channel @xcite .",
    "while the former are generally constructed simply on the basis of heavy target nuclei ( since the interaction cross section varies as @xmath1 ) , the latter require consideration of the spin structure of the detector nuclei and are customarily defined by whether the primary experiment sensitivity is to wimp - proton or wimp - neutron spin coupling .",
    "the main efforts to date have been in spin - independent searches , generally because the anticipated cross sections are larger owing to a coherent interaction across the nucleus .",
    "as recently noted by bednyakov and @xmath2imkovic @xcite , however , the importance of the spin - dependent sector can not however be ignored : such searches provide twice stronger constraints on susy parameter space , permit the detection of large nuclei recoil energy due to nuclear structure effects in the case of heavy target nuclei , and prevent missing a dark matter signal which might be suppressed in the spin - independent sector .",
    "if the neutralino is predominantly gaugino or higgsino states , the coupling is only spin - dependent @xcite .",
    "the above distinction in search efforts has become somewhat blurred , since many detector heavy isotopes also possess spin and even a small natural isotopic abundance can produce significant constraints .",
    "in fact , a single detector can simultaneously provide restrictions on both channels of the wimp - nucleon interaction , but with sensitivity in each channel dependent on the nature of the detector material .",
    "the most stringent limits in the spin - dependent sector are currently provided by experiments traditionally considered spin - independent .",
    "the future thrust of direct searches for wimp dark matter is defined by a number of project upgrades and several new high profile activities . basically designed for deeply probing the spin - independent phase space , these experiments project eventual sensitivities beginning well below the controversial dama/@xmath0 result and extending to cross sections as small as @xmath3 pb in the wimp - nucleon interaction .",
    "we here consider the impact of this activity thrust on the spin - dependent sector , finding that of those experiments with spin - sensitivity , most all will provide increasingly improved restrictions predominantly on the possible wimp - neutron spin coupling , with significantly less impact on the wimp - proton coupling .",
    "this latter sector is in fact observed to have previously received comparatively little direct experiment attention , with the current restrictions derived from @xmath0 experiments already surpassed by two orders of magnitude in sensitivity by the indirect searches @xcite . given that there however remain important theoretical questions regarding the extraction of the indirect results , we examine the situation of direct experiments with predominantly wimp - proton spin sensitivity , towards identifying those with capacity to provide similar restrictions .",
