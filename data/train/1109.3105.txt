    "time evolution of a charged pion state is determined by the schrdinger equation with the weak interaction hamiltonian , and the state vector of a single pion at @xmath2 becomes a superposition of one pion state and a state composed of a charged lepton and a neutrino at @xmath3 .",
    "a decay of the pion is studied normally with a transition amplitude at the infinite t of plane waves , i.e. , asymptotic boundary conditions .",
    "this paper presents that t - dependent probabilities of the decay products give valuable informations , particularly on the neutrino , that are not found with the asymptotic values . since the wave function describes a time dependent development of the neutrino , the wave function is used to compute the time - dependent probability , which reveals wave phenomena .",
    "these physical quantities have been unable to observe experimentally with high precision before due to low statistics , but they are becoming possible with high statistics data of the current experiments .",
    "we study the neutrino detection probability in a situation where the initial pion is prepared in a plane wave using an s - matrix of a finite time interval .",
    "if the neutrino at a detector region is highly correlated , this wave is different from an isolated free wave and is not expressed by the plane wave of satisfying the asymptotic boundary condition of the s - matrix . in this region , expressing neutrinos with plane waves and studying their detection processes with the ordinary s - matrix @xcite , are not appropriate .",
    "an s - matrix of a finite time interval defined by the mller operator at the finite time interval @xmath4 as , @xmath5=\\omega_{-}^{\\dagger}(\\text t)\\omega_{+}(\\text t)$ ] , is appropriate to study the finite - size correction of the neutrino detection probability .",
    "since wave packets decrease rapidly at large @xmath6 and satisfy the asymptotic boundary conditions , the s - matrix of a finite time interval is expressed with the wave packets .",
    "one feature of the scattering of the finite time interval is that @xmath5 $ ] does not commute with the free hamiltonian @xmath7 but satisfies @xmath8,h_0]=   i({\\partial \\over \\partial      \\text{t}}\\omega_{-}(\\text{t}))^{\\dagger}\\omega_{+}(\\text{t})-      i\\omega_{-}(\\text{t})^{\\dagger}{\\partial \\over \\partial \\text{t } }      \\omega_{+}(\\text{t}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus the energy is not conserved by @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "final states of having the different energy from that of the initial state contribute to the finite - size correction of the transition probability .",
    "furthermore , the finite - size correction has a universal property and is computed rigorously .",
    "we study the neutrino in the pion decay with @xmath5 $ ] , and find that the neutrino flux has a large finite - size correction of a form of a diffraction .",
    "we summarize our results first .",
    "the fluxes of the neutrino and charged lepton in pion decays are defined with their detection rates and are given at a macroscopic distance in the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 agrees with a normal term calculated with the standard method and @xmath12 is a diffraction term which is derived from the energy - nonconserving final states .",
    "the diffraction components for the neutrino , @xmath13 , and for the charged lepton , @xmath14(t ) , are expressed by the masses @xmath15 and the mixing matrix @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the mass eigenstate , in the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a constant obtained later , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 @xmath23 is positive definite and decreases with a product @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 becomes large and @xmath26 vanishes at a macroscopic time for the charged leptons , but @xmath27 becomes finite for the neutrinos .",
    "hence @xmath12 is finite in neutrinos and depends upon an average mass - squared @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath11 is the normal term and includes flavor oscillations with the period determined by the mass - squared differences @xmath29 . for charged leptons",
    "the diffraction terms vanish and physical quantities are computed with the normal term .    due to the small mass , relativistic invariance , and other features , the diffraction effect becomes observable in the neutrinos .",
    "the detection rates become different from their production rates at the macroscopic distances .",
    "especially because the energy - momentum is not conserved in the diffraction component , the helicity suppression mechanism does not work and the electron neutrino is not suppressed compared to the muon neutrino in the near - detector region .",
    "this resolves the lsnd anomaly @xcite and some previous experiments .",
    "now we derive the diffraction term @xcite . to show this effect being distinct from a flavor oscillation , the formula for one specie of neutrino",
    "is studied first .",
    "we suppose that a neutrino is observed through its incoherent interaction with one of nucleus .",
    "then its detection amplitude in the pion decay process is expressed as , @xmath30 . here",
    "a pion is prepared at a time @xmath31 , and a neutrino is detected at @xmath32 , where the distance @xmath33 is macroscopic .",
    "a detected neutrino is expressed by a wave packet that represents the nucleon wave function in a nucleus that neutrinos interact .",
    "the neutrino wave packet @xcite is described by the central values of the momentum and coordinate , @xmath34 and the width , @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "they are expressed in the form @xmath36 is written with the hadronic @xmath37 current and dirac spinors in the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 , and the time @xmath40 is integrated in the region @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 is the size of the neutrino wave packet and was estimated using the size of a nucleus .",
    "the gaussian form of the wave packet is used for the sake of simplicity to obtain the finite - size correction in this paper .",
    "its long - distance behavior is the same in general wave packets as was verified in @xcite .",
    "the muon momentum of @xmath43 and broad tail of @xmath44 contribute to this amplitude .",
    "the former component is the normal one and the latter one is a diffraction component which is shown to be computable rigorously using a light - cone singularity of relativistic invariant systems .",
    "the neutrino momentum @xmath45 is integrated easily in eq.@xmath46 and the coordinate representation of the neutrino wave is obtained , which shows the time evolution of the neutrino wave function in the backward direction . at @xmath47 ,",
    "the wave function agrees with the gaussian function of the center @xmath48 and at @xmath49 the position of the center is at @xmath50 , which overlaps with the pion and muon wave functions .",
    "integrating the space coordinates , a gaussian function of the momenta , which shows that the momenta are approximately conserved , are obtained .",
    "the time is integrated in the finite interval @xmath51 and the amplitude is proportional to the t - dependent term , @xmath52 \\over e(p_{\\mu})+e({p_{\\nu}})-e(p_{\\pi } ) -{\\vec v}_{\\nu}\\cdot({\\vec p}_{\\nu}+{\\vec   p}_{\\mu}-{\\vec p}_{\\pi})}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the energy is modified by the @xmath53 dependent term and particularly the neutrino energy and momentum are combined to the small value , @xmath54 . hence the muon energy can be larger than that of the energy - momentum conserved system and leads the large finite - size correction .    to compute the amplitude and probability of this component rigorously , we introduce a correlation function and write the probability , after the spin summations are made , in the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 is a normalization volume for the initial pion , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 in this expression the momentum is integrated first , which is possible because the probability is finite and integration variables can be interchanged .    the waves of charged lepton at the ultra - violet energy regions cause a light - cone singularity .",
    "changing the variable to @xmath62 and integrating the four dimensional @xmath63 , we are able to extract the light - cone singularity @xmath64 @xcite easily .",
    "the integral from the region @xmath65 leads @xmath64 and the terms written by bessel functions , while that from @xmath66 leads the rapidly oscillating term .",
    "the light - cone singularity is real without oscillation and is extended to infinity and the others either oscillate or decrease rapidly .",
    "so this expression is useful to find the finite - size correction of the probability which is unable to obtain with standard calculations of plane waves . in the first region",
    "the energy is not conserved , and the integral vanishes at @xmath67 in fact .",
    "the second one , on the other hand , is that of conserving the energy and determines the quantities at @xmath67 .",
    "this expression of writing the probability with the light - cone singularity converges and is valid in the kinematical region @xmath68 , where @xmath69 .    substituting the expression of @xmath70 into eq.@xmath71",
    ", we have the phase factor of the neutrino wave at the light - cone position @xmath72 in the form , @xmath73 of a slow angular velocity . next an integration on the coordinates",
    ", @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and @xmath76 and @xmath77 in the finite @xmath78 , leads the slowly decreasing term @xmath79 and the normal term @xmath80 .",
    "@xmath81 is generated from the light - cone singularity and related term and at @xmath82 , @xmath83 vanishes .",
    "the normal term , @xmath80 , is from the rest . due to the rapid oscillation in @xmath84 , @xmath85 gets contribution from the microscopic @xmath84 region and is constant in t. this term does not depend on @xmath86 and agrees with the normal probability obtained with the standard method of using plane waves . in the region",
    "@xmath87 , @xmath70 does not have a light - cone singularity and the diffraction term exists only in the kinematical region @xmath88 .",
    "this region depends upon the charged - lepton mass , hence the diffraction terms of all three mass eigenstates converge in the union of the kinematical regions of the three masses , @xmath89 .",
    "the diffraction terms is applied in this region in this paper .",
    "we compute the total probability next . from the integration of neutrino s",
    "coordinates @xmath48 the total volume @xmath57 is obtained and cancelled with the normalization of the initial pion state . the total probability ,",
    "then , becomes sum of the normal term @xmath85 and the diffraction term @xmath90 , @xmath91 , % \\label{probability-3 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 and @xmath93 is the length of the decay region .",
    "@xmath94 is the neutrino flux when it interacts with the physical state of finite size target of @xmath35 . at finite t",
    ", the flux has the diffraction component , which is caused by the superposition of waves and stable under the variation of the pion s momentum . at @xmath95 ,",
    "the diffraction term vanishes and the probability @xmath94 agrees with the value of the standard calculation using plane waves .",
    "now we study each term in eq.@xmath96 . in the normal term",
    ", energy and momentum are approximately conserved , and @xmath85 has a sharp peak at @xmath97 .",
    "hence the factor @xmath98 in eq.@xmath96 becomes @xmath99 and the rate is proportional to @xmath99 .",
    "integration of the neutrino s angle leads this integral independent of the angle width , as far as it include the narrow peak .",
    "the value is independent also from @xmath35 , which is consistent with the condition for the stationary state @xcite , and agrees with the value of the ordinary method , which has the suppression of the electron mode . on the other hand ,",
    "the diffraction component is present in the wide kinematical region , @xmath100 and depends on @xmath35 .",
    "the size of the nucleus of the mass number @xmath101 , @xmath102 makes the value , @xmath103 for the @xmath104c nucleus . since the energy",
    "non - conserving states contribute , the diffraction component has a larger value of @xmath105 in eq.@xmath96 than @xmath99 .",
    "hence the branching ratio to the electron mode can become much larger than that of the normal terms and is determined by the integral of the diffraction component over the angle covered by the detector in the above region .",
    "this value is sensitive to the geometry of the experiment and could be much larger than @xmath106 , if the distance between the decay region and the detector is small .",
    "the energy and @xmath107 dependences of the fraction of the diffraction component are presented in fig.[fig : total - int-2 ] for @xmath108 $ ] , @xmath109[gev ] , and @xmath110[m ] .",
    "the energy distribution of the diffraction term has a peak at @xmath111[mev ] , and the @xmath107 distribution is broad in the diffraction component and is sharp in the normal component .    from fig.@xmath112 , there is an excess due to the diffraction in the short distance region and the maximal excess is about @xmath113 of the normal term .",
    "the diffraction term is slowly varying with both the distance and energy .",
    "the typical length @xmath114 of this universal behavior is @xmath115 = { 2e_{\\nu } \\hbar c / m_{\\nu}^2 } = 20\\times { e_{\\nu}[50\\text{mev}]/   m_{\\nu}^2[\\text{ev}^2/c^4]}$ ] .",
    "the diffraction is stable with the energy , hence a measurement with a finite uncertainty of the neutrino s energy @xmath116 , which is of the order @xmath117 , does not change the value much .",
    "for instance , with the uncertainty @xmath118[mev ] of the energy @xmath119[mev ] the diffraction component does not change at all . for a larger value of energy uncertainty , too , the diffraction is stable under a change of the energy and is computed from eq.([probability-3 ] ) .",
    "formulae for general three families are easily obtained from the one species formula .",
    "since the light - cone singularity in @xmath70 and the diffraction term have the universal form that is independent of the mass of the charged lepton , and depends upon the absolute neutrino mass , the diffraction term to the electron neutrino is obtained from the mixing matrix @xmath16 , eq.@xmath120 .",
    "hence the flux of the electron neutrino is written with the average mass @xmath121 , @xmath122 .",
    "the average value coincides with @xmath123 if the @xmath124 are much smaller than the average value .    historically using neutrinos in pion",
    "decays , twn @xcite proved that two neutrinos are different , and lsnd @xcite claimed observation of @xmath125 transition with a large @xmath126 $ ] .",
    "unfortunately this value is inconsistent with miniboone @xcite which was designed to to test lsnd and the values @xmath127 $ ] from other experiments @xcite .",
    "twn found also signals of electron neutrino flux at an order of @xmath128 per cent , which is too large for the flavor oscillation assumption .",
    "so electron neutrino events of lsnd and twn are inconsistent with other neutrino experiments , if they are attributed to flavor oscillations .",
    "they have been puzzles for quite some time .",
    "now we compare the theoretical value of electron neutrino events with experiments .",
    "the normal component is negligibly small due to helicity suppression and the diffraction component @xmath129 is finite and is studied .",
    "the neutrino flux in the decay pipe area is computed from the diffraction formula and the neutrino expressed by the wave packet of @xmath35 determined by the detector propagates freely in the next area between the decay pipe and the detector region .",
    "the distribution is spread with @xmath130 and has different geometrical behaviors from the normal component in the detector .",
    "effects of geometries are important .",
    "the geometries of twn and lsnd are similar and the lengths between the pion source and the neutrino detector , @xmath131 , and those of the decay region , @xmath132 , are given in table [ geometry - experiments ] .",
    "@xmath133 $ ] of @xmath132 is the length of the decay region in air , while the whole decay region is @xmath134 $ ] . since the length between the detectors and the sources of miniboone and cdhsw(f ) @xcite is as large as 10 times those of twn and lsnd , the contributions of diffraction terms are @xmath135 of twn and lsnd . at cdhsw(n ) , the length is @xmath136 times of twn and lsnd but the energy is higher and about the same magnitude of the diffraction term is obtained .",
    "the diffraction term comes from the tree diagram and is suppressed strongly in matter , karmen @xcite .",
    "the diffraction component is important in decay in air but is complicated in decay in matter .",
    "its magnitude will be studied in a future publication .",
    "we compute the fraction of the diffraction components by taking into account the geometry . in lsnd ,",
    "the decay region in air is about @xmath133 $ ] long and the detector is located @xmath137 $ ] away from the decay region . in this case , the ratio becomes @xmath138 percent at @xmath139 $ ] . in twn ,",
    "the decay region is about @xmath140 $ ] long and the detector is located @xmath141 $ ] away from the decay region . the neutrino detection angle is much wider and the ratio becomes about @xmath142 percent at @xmath139 $ ] . in cdhsw ,",
    "the energies of pion and neutrino are higher and iron is used for the detector . including these effects , theoretical values",
    "are obtained .",
    "the ratios @xmath143 of our theory and @xmath144 of experiments are summarized in table @xmath145 .",
    "uncertainties in twn are not known and ignored .",
    "the fractions of the diffraction components obtained in this way are presented in fig.[fig : total - int-1 ] for the mass of the neutrino , @xmath146 $ ] , and the pion momentum @xmath147 [ mev / c ] in lsnd and @xmath148 [ mev / c ] in twn , and the neutrino energy @xmath149[mev ] in lsnd and @xmath150[mev ] in twn .",
    "the fractions of the theory agree with those of the experiments using the same @xmath151 .",
    "the magnitude of electron neutrino flux agreed with lsnd in flight and twn but not to others including miniboone .",
    "since matter effect in lsnd at rest is complicated , we study only lsnd in flight here . in fig.3 , the electron neutrino fraction from the neutrino diffraction",
    "is compared with those of the flavor oscillations of standard parameters of @xmath152 and of a sterile neutrino .",
    "the neutrino diffraction explains naturally the excess of the electron neutrino .",
    "thus the puzzles are resolved and consistent understanding of the neutrino experiments are obtained .",
    "furthermore , information on the absolute neutrino mass is obtained @xcite .",
    "it is found that the neutrino detection rate has the unusual finite - size correction in the macroscopic distance . instead of the standard s - matrix @xmath153 $ ] , which is useless to study the finite - size correction , we studied the s - matrix of the finite time interval @xmath9 $ ] and computed the finite - size correction of the detection probabilities which are measured in experiments .",
    "the asymptotic boundary conditions must be satisfied for the scattering or decay processes , hence the wave packets are necessary for @xmath9 $ ] and are used .",
    "one feature is that s[t ] does not commute with the free hamiltonian @xmath7 and both final states of conserving the energy and those of non - conserving energy contribute .",
    "the rate from the former is independent of both @xmath154 and @xmath35 and agrees with that of the standard method , while that from the latter depends on @xmath154 and @xmath35 and does not satisfy various relations of the former such as the helicity suppression , symmetry between the neutrinos and charged leptons , and others .",
    "the electron neutrino flux due to the diffraction was computed in the geometries of lsnd and twn and excellent agreements between the theory and experiments are obtained . because the electron neutrino flux due to diffraction is determined by the average neutrino mass @xmath155 , the excesses of the electron neutrino suggest that @xmath155 is around @xmath156 $ ] . if the @xmath155 is in this range and @xmath1 of the experiments are used , lsnd and twn electron events are attributed to the diffraction component but not to the flavor oscillation .",
    "thus the controversy related with lsnd and twn are resolved .",
    "some information on the absolute neutrino mass is obtained , furthermore .",
    "the confirmation of the neutrino diffraction would be made in a new experiment from the unique behaviors of the neutrino spectrum on the @xmath130 , energy , and angle .",
    "since the helicity suppression does not work in the diffraction component , the flux of the electron neutrino becomes about @xmath128 %  of that of the muon neutrino at the maximum value .",
    "furthermore it has the unique properties that are very different from the normal term .",
    "if clear distinctions are observed on the dependences of these variables and agreements with the theory are found , the neutrino diffraction will be confirmed . since at much larger distance than the above length",
    ", the diffraction component disappears and only the normal flavor oscillation terms remain , the experiment to measure the excess due to the diffraction component should be made at a short distance .",
    "the present results may exhibit violations of two important relations , the unitarity and lepton number conservation .",
    "however that is not the case and they are not violated .",
    "first , from the behavior of the diffraction component that the detection rate is decreasing with @xmath154 , the neutrino number looks decreasing and an unitarity is violated superficially . since the neutrino is detected at the distant position , the detection time is delayed .",
    "the retarded and interference effects made the detection probability deviate from the neutrino number .",
    "hence the decreasing behavior of @xmath157 is in - connected with both the decreasing neutrino number and unitarity . in the text ,",
    "@xmath157 is computed with @xmath9 $ ] that satisfies the proper boundary condition of the experiments and the unitarity condition @xmath9^{\\dagger}s[\\text{t}]=1 $ ] .",
    "if the @xmath154 dependent neutrino probability were computed with @xmath153 $ ] , this would not have decreased with @xmath154 .",
    "however , the @xmath158 $ ] does not satisfy the proper boundary condition for the neutrino at @xmath154 and is neither applied nor compared with the probability measured by the experiment .",
    "@xmath159 $ ] , on the other hand , satisfies the proper boundary condition and is used for comparisons with the experiments at the finite @xmath154 .",
    "one of the important findings of the present work is that @xmath159 $ ] gives the different results from @xmath153 $ ] even in the macroscopic @xmath154 .",
    "second , asymmetric behaviors of @xmath79 lead that the neutrino detection rates are very different from those of the charged leptons .",
    "this is not in - consistent with the lepton number conservations but means that the detection probability is different from the neutrino number owing to the finite - size correction caused by retarded and interference effects .",
    "when either the neutrinos or the charged leptons are observed , their detection rates are different .",
    "nevertheless , when both of neutrino and charged lepton are observed simultaneously , they have the same rates , due to the lepton number conservations .",
    "the shorter life time of the pion in the situation when the neutrino is observed at a small distance than that of the free pion has not been tested and will be confirmed in a future experiment . then if the muon is measured simultaneously , this muon shows the same behavior from the lepton number conservation .",
    "the detection rate of the muon depends on the boundary condition on the neutrino .    in this paper",
    "we ignored the higher order effects such as the pion life time and the pion mean free path in studying the quantum effects .",
