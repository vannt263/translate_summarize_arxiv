    "the vortices move together with the supercurrent ( `` ballistic limit '' , with the hall angle close to @xmath0 ) . at sufficiently strong disorder ,",

    "stephen theory gives the same result ( up to a numerical factor ) as the accurate quasiclassical calculation @xcite .",
    "it has been recently suggested that the microscopic structure of the core excitations may play a much more prominent role in that part of the dissipative regime where the excitation spectrum remains discrete ( sharp quasiparticle levels ) , specifically in layered superconductors@xcite . in the clean limit ( i.e. , for scattering rates @xmath1 much smaller than the superconducting gap @xmath2 )",
    ", the motion of quasiparticles in the vortex core is ballistic : they cross the vortex core many times before scattering off impurities .",

    "@xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the fermi energy ) the levels inside a two - dimensional vortex split into two sets ( ` combs ' ) of equally spaced levels @xcite .",
    "the transformation of this correlated spectrum into a featureless uncorrelated one with increasing disorder proceeds in distinct steps : within the moderately clean regime ( @xmath5 ) a new intermediate region ( @xmath6 ) has been found @xcite where the comb structure remains preserved but is randomly shifted in energy ( the number of impurities in the core has to be small enough to preserve the ` combs ' , while being large enough to randomize the overall shift ) . increasing the impurity concentration further ( already in the moderately clean limit for weak impurities @xcite , and ultimately in the dirty limit @xcite ) , the ` comb ' structure is destroyed with a crossover to the class @xmath7 random - matrix ensemble@xcite .    keeping within the moderately clean regime with a discrete spectrum , in two - dimensional ( or layered ) superconductors there further",
    "exist two limits of dissipation @xcite : the first one applies to the slowly moving vortex with a discrete quasiparticle spectrum ( `` discrete - spectrum regime '' ) where the dissipation is due to landau  zener transitions between individual levels @xcite .",
    "the second limit is with levels smeared into a continuum either by the vortex motion or by inelastic processes ( `` continuum - spectrum regime '' ) ; the dissipation then is given by the linear - response kubo formula @xcite . at low temperatures ,",
    "the inelastic smearing can be neglected and the crossover between these two regimes is controlled by the vortex velocity with the characteristic velocity given by @xmath8 ( here , @xmath2 is the superconducting gap and @xmath9 denotes the elastic mean free path@xcite ) .    in the framework of random - matrix models with time - dependent hamiltonians ,",
    "the dissipation in the discrete - spectrum and continuum - spectrum regimes was considered by wilkinson @xcite .",
    "he finds that , in the case of the unitary wigner ",
    "dyson ensemble , the linear dissipative response remains valid in the whole range of velocities , both in the continuum - spectrum ( high velocity ) and in the discrete - spectrum ( low velocity ) regimes .",
    "based on this fact and on the similarity between the unitary and class @xmath7 ensembles , it was shown that with the class @xmath7 level statistics the dissipation rate nearly follows the bardeen - stephen prediction , even in the limit of small velocities @xmath10 where the quasiclassical description is no longer valid @xcite .",
    "contrary , it was claimed in ref .   that the additional correlation between levels ( the ` two - comb ' structure ) may lead to an anomalously high vortex viscosity in the moderately clean regime in the low - velocity limit .    in our paper",

    "we find that in spite of the level correlations derived in refs .  , the vortex viscosity does not differ from the well - known quasiclassical result @xcite for three - dimensional superconductors . within the same microscopic model we consider separately the discrete - spectrum and continuum - spectrum regimes of dissipation :",

    "may be classified as the circular unitary random - matrix ensemble of dimension two@xcite .",
    "therefore our findings may be considered as a generalization of wilkinson s results @xcite to circular ensembles .",
    "we also find the scattering time @xmath15 for quasiparticles in the core in the @xmath11-wave approximation : for a weak impurity strength , the effective @xmath16 is larger than the bulk scattering rate @xmath17 by the logarithm of the impurity strength .",
