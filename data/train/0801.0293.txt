    "sgr  b2 ( @xmath2@xmath38.5kpc ) and orion  kl ( @xmath2@xmath3450pc ) can be considered to be the two most remarkable giant molecular clouds for astrochemistry and star - forming region ( sfr ) studies .",
    "they are also very appropriate sources to construct a _ template _ for more distant ( e.g. , fainter ) and unresolved regions ( e.g. , extragalactic ) .",
    "sgr  b2 , represents the most active burst of high  mass star formation in the galactic center region ( lis & goldsmith 1989 ) .",
    "its geometrical properties ( clumped extended envelope , centrally condensed hot cores and hii regions ) , its physical conditions ( widespread warm gas , enhanced turbulence and uv and x  ray radiation fields ) as well as its chemical complexity ( extended emission of refractory and organic species ) mimic a miniature  galactic center \" .",
    "therefore , it provides the closest _ guide _ for studies of starbursts vs. active galactic nuclei .",
    "orion is the nearest and best studied high ",
    "mass sfr ( genzel & stutzki  1989 ) . due to its proximity , high spectral and angular resolution observations allow us to separate the very different physical components associated with high  mass sfrs ( hot cores , outflows , shocks , pdr - like interfaces and ambient gas ) .",
    "in particular , orion has been traditionally used to _ test _",
    "our understanding of the physics and chemistry in hot cores ( e.g. ,  irc2 ) and extended shocked regions ( e.g. ,  peaks 1/2 ) .",
    "the cores of both sfrs are the most prolific sites of molecular line emission / absorption in the galaxy ( in terms of density and intensity / depth of lines ) . due to the large column density of warm material ( sgr  b2 ) or due to its proximity ( orion ) , both complexes are among the brightest far  ir sources in the entire sky . for these reasons ,",
    "sgr  b2 and orion  kl were fully surveyed between @xmath043 and 197@xmath1 m at the maximum spectral resolution provided by the iso / lws fabry ",
    "prot ( @xmath4@xmath010,000 or @xmath030kms@xmath5 ) .",
    "these data cover an extremely important region of the electromagnetic spectrum that can not be accessed from the ground .",
    "the resulting spectra remain unique examples of the diagnostic power of this domain , and archetypes of what future far ",
    "ir space missions will routinely observe . in this constribution",
    "we review the main highlights of iso data and we stress some peculiarities in the interpretation of far  ir line and continuum emission .",
    "the far  ir spectrum of sgr  b2 ( goicoechea et al .  2004 ; polehampton et al .",
    "2007 and references therein ) contains : @xmath6 the peak of the thermal emission from dust ( a blackbody at 30k roughly peaks at 100@xmath1 m ) ; @xmath7  atomic fine structure lines that are major coolants of the warm gas , and excellent discriminants of the pdr , hii and shock emission ( oi , oiii , cii , nii , niii ) ; @xmath8 rotational lines from key light hydrides ( h@xmath9o , oh , h@xmath10o@xmath11 , ch@xmath9 , ch , nh@xmath10 , nh@xmath9 , nh , hf , hd , h@xmath9d@xmath11 ) and ro - vibrational lines from abundant nonpolar molecules ( c@xmath10 ) .",
    "these species provide unique information on the prevailing physical conditions and on the basic o , c , n and d chemistry .",
    "most of the molecular lines appear in absorption whereas atomic and ionic lines appear in emission ( except for absorption in the [ oi]63 and [ cii]158@xmath1 m lines ) .",
    "in particular , [ oi]63 and [ cii]158@xmath1 m velocity resolved absorption line profiles provide clues regarding several peculiarities observed in some extragalactic spectra at lower resolution ( e.g. , the cii / far - ir deficit ) . the main gas component traced by far ",
    "ir observations is the warm , low density envelope of sgr  b2 ( t@xmath12@xmath3300 - 500k ; @xmath13(h@xmath9)@xmath1410@xmath15@xmath16 ) . given the low densities in this component , no high@xmath17 co line was detected at iso s sensitivity .",
    "this situation may apply to other _",
    "warm _ regions observed in the far  ir . the warm , low ",
    "density gas is particularly difficult to trace in the millimeter domain where one usually observes molecular emission lines from collisionally excited gas ( i.e. , from the denser star forming cores ) . finally , because of its location in the galactic center ,",
    "all ground  state lines towards sgr  b2 show a broad absorption profile ( @xmath18@xmath3200kms@xmath5 ) due to foreground absorption produced by the spiral arm clouds in the line of sight .    on the other hand , the far  ir spectrum of orion  kl ( lerate et al .",
    "2006 and references therein ) is dominated by emission lines from molecular ( h@xmath9o , oh , nh@xmath10 , high@xmath17 co ) and atomic species .",
    "interestingly enough , h@xmath9o and oh line profiles show a complex behavior ( when observed at high spectral resolution ) evolving from pure absorption , p  cygni type , to pure emission , depending on the transition wavelength , @xmath19 and line opacity .",
    "these lines arise from orion outflow(s ) and associated shocked regions . without resolving these profiles ,",
    "low resolution spectra of similar regions may lead to a misinterpretation of the prevailing dynamics and physical conditions .",
    "given the high densities and temperatures of orion s shocked gas , co emission up to @xmath17=39 has been detected ( e@xmath20@xmath34,000k ) .",
    "both sfrs show a strong far - ir continuum due to thermal emission of dust grains . in the case of sgr",
    "b2 ( t@xmath21@xmath330k ) , the continuum emission towards the main star forming cores ( m and n ) is optically thick in most of the far  ir domain ( @xmath22@xmath231 ) .",
    "this particularity greatly influences the excitation of molecular species and also produces a _ screen effect _",
    ", i.e. , * continuum * and * line * observations are mostly sensitive the * outer layers of the cloud * ( its envelope ) . since",
    "different cloud depths are traced at different wavelengths , a correct interpretation of far ",
    "ir observations requires a careful treatment of the dust radiative transfer problem .",
    "molecular and atomic lines can appear in absorption towards a strong far  ir background ( e.g. , sgr  b2 ) .",
    "this means that lines arise in regions were excitation temperatures ( t@xmath24 ) are lower than the brightness temperature of the underlying continuum ( @xmath3t@xmath21 ) .",
    "therefore , even if collisional excitation plays a role , far - ir dust photons decisively affect the level population , and thus t@xmath24 .",
    "in particular , a strong far - ir radiation field can efficiently pump high energy levels even if t@xmath12@xmath25e@xmath20 ( e.g. , h@xmath9o lines with e@xmath20 up to @xmath02,000k have been detected towards orion  kl where we estimate t@xmath12@xmath3100k ) . in consequence ,",
    "level populations can be primarily determined by the thermal emission of dust and not by inelastic collisions with other species .",
    "since line photons cool the gas when energy is transfered from kinetic motions into radiation that escapes the cloud , photons emitted from such radiatively pumped transitions do not contribute to the _ gas cooling_. instead , they may contribute to the _ gas heating _ through collisional de - excitation .",
    "furthermore , given the high critical densities of far  ir molecular transitions , _ collisional _ thermalization ( lte ) hardly occurs at the typical densities of molecular clouds .",
    "transitions can be however very close to _ radiative _ thermalization ( t@xmath24@xmath3t@xmath21 ) .",
    "these are the main differences with the radiative transport at lower frequencies ( e.g. , the mm domain ) , where one can usually neglect the effect of dust emission / absorption .    in summary ,",
    "line radiative transfer and level excitation of the species dominating the far  ir spectra of sgr  b2 and orion are characterized by : @xmath6 broad range of radiative and collisional rate coefficients ( e.g , with closely spaced transitions in wavelength but with line strengths and einstein coefficients that vary by orders of magnitude ) . @xmath7 both collisional excitation ( with h@xmath9 , he and even h and @xmath26 in regions like pdrs where the electron abundance is large and the molecular fraction is low ) , and radiative excitation by dust photons play a role .",
    "@xmath8  gas and dust coupled radiative transfer .",
    "very large line and continuum opacities are possible .",
    "the former point ( @xmath27@xmath281 ) often leads to line  trapping and significant scattering in the lowest - energy transitions produced by foreground low density halos .",
    "the later point ( @xmath29@xmath231 ) makes that * even * optically thin lines do not trace the full cloud line  of  sight because the line profile is formed in the outermost cloud layers not veiled by the dust opacity ( e.g. , _",
    "hidden _ hot core emission ) .",
    "therefore , molecular excitation is generally a highly nonlocal , non  lte problem , where standard analysis tools ( rotation diagrams or lvg ) are often non applicable .",
    "additional complications may arise in the presence of velocity fields ( e.g. , pcygni profiles from orion s outflows ) or overlapping transitions ( e.g.  oh hyperfine components ) .",
    "many unsolved questions remain regarding the origin of the oxygen chemistry ( e.g. ,  main water formation routes in orion ) and the dominant heating mechanisms ( e.g. ,  sgr  b2 envelope ) .",
    "the relatively large ( beam  averaged ) water and oh abundances inferred towards orion  kl ( @xmath30(h@xmath9o)@xmath32@xmath3110@xmath32 and @xmath30(oh)@xmath310@xmath33 ) but moderate temperatures ( t@xmath12@xmath3100k ) either suggests that @xmath6 h@xmath9o could have been formed in the shocked gas by neutral  neutral reactions with activation barriers if the gas was previously heated to @xmath34500k , and/or @xmath7 h@xmath9o formation in orion outflow(s ) is dominated by _ in situ _ evaporation of grain water  ice mantles , an / or @xmath8 h@xmath9o is formed in the inner hot core regions and then is swept up by the outflow ( cernicharo et al .",
    "2006a ; goicoechea et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "similar oh and h@xmath9o abundances have been inferred towards sgr  b2 s envelope ( goicoechea & cernicharo 2002 ; cernicharo et al .",
    "2006b ) where beam  averaged temperatures are higher ( t@xmath12@xmath3300 - 500k ) .",
    "penetration of uv radiation from ionizing stars is thought to play a role in the cloud physics and chemistry .",
    "still , it is not clear wether radiative ( e.g. photoelectric ) or mechanical ( e.g. , shocks ) heating mechanisms are the origin of the high temperatures",
    ". the improved sensitivity of future space missions will allow key spectral diagnostics to be _ mapped _ over very large areas .",
    "in addition , abundant molecular species such as h@xmath9o and oh will dominate the far - ir spectra of extragalactic nuclei , providing excellent diagnostic tools of the warm gas ( see goicoechea et al . 2005 for oh detections in ngc253 and ngc1068 ) .",
    "sgr  b2 and orion  kl will , however , remain as key templates to constrain the chemical content and spatial segregation in sfrs , and to study the physical mechanisms that play a role in the cloud dynamics and chemistry .",
