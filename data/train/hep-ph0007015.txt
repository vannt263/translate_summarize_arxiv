    "the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking involved in early universe phase transitions in some grand unified theories ( gut ) might lead to the formation of topological defects  @xcite . among them , only cosmic strings happen to be compatible with observational cosmology if they form at the gut scale .",
    "it was shown however by witten  @xcite that , depending on the explicit realization of the symmetry breaking scheme as well as on the various particle couplings , a current could build along the strings , thereby effectively turning them into superconducting wires .",
    "such wires were originally considered in the case the current couples to the electromagnetic field so they may be responsible for a variety of new effects , including an explosive scenario for large scale structure formation for which an enormous energy release was realized in the form of an expanding shell of non propagating photons in the surrounding plasma  @xcite .",
    "the cosmology of strings has been the subject of intense work in the last twenty years or so  @xcite , mainly based on ordinary strings , global or local , aiming at deriving the large scale structure properties stemming from their distribution as well as their imprint in the microwave background  @xcite .",
    "it was even shown  @xcite that the most recent data  @xcite might support a non negligible contribution of such defects .",
    "as such a result requires ordinary strings , it turns out to be of uttermost importance to understand the influence of currents in the cosmological context .",
    "indeed , it can be argued that currents might drastically modify the cosmological evolution of a string network : the most clearly defined consequence of the existence of a current flowing along a vortex is the breaking of the boost invariance , since the current itself defines a privileged frame . in other words ,",
    "the energy per unit length @xmath0 and the tension @xmath1 become two different numbers , contrary to the ordinary ( goto - nambu  @xcite ) case . as a result ,",
    "string loops become endowed with the capability of rotation ( the latter being meaningless for @xmath2 ) , and the induced centrifugal force permits equilibrium configurations , called vortons  @xcite .",
    "they would very rapidly reach a regime where they would scale as ordinary non relativistic matter , until they come to completely dominate the universe  @xcite .    in the original witten model  @xcite",
    ", currents could form by means of two different mechanisms .",
    "scalar fields , directly coupled with the string forming higgs field , could feel a localized potential into which they could accumulate in the form of bound states , while fermions could be trapped along the string , propagating at the speed of light , as zero energy solutions of the two dimensional dirac equation around the vortex .",
    "other models were proposed where fermions could also propagate in the string core at lower velocities in the form of massive modes  @xcite , or ( possibly charged ) vector fields could also condense  @xcite .",
    "all these models have essentially made clear that the existence of currents in string is much more than a mere possibility but rather an almost unavoidable fact in realistic particle physics theories .    for scalar as well as vector carriers , the task of understanding the microphysics",
    "is made simple thanks to their bosonic nature : all the trapped particles go into the same lowest accessible energy state and the field can be treated classically  @xcite .",
    "even the surrounding electromagnetic  @xcite and gravitational  @xcite fields generated by the current can be treated this way and the backreaction can be included easily  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , a general formalism was set up by carter  @xcite to describe current - carrying string dynamics .",
    "the formalism is based on a single so - called state parameter , @xmath3 say , of which the energy per unit length , the tension and the current itself are functions .",
    "such a formalism relied heavily on the fact that for a bosonic carrier , the relevant quantity whose variation along the string leads to a current is its phase , and the state parameter is essentially identifiable to this phase gradient .",
    "various equations of state relating the tension to the energy per unit length were then derived  @xcite , based on numerical results and the existence of a phase frequency threshold  @xcite .",
    "it even includes the special case of a chiral current  @xcite , although the latter originates in principle only for a purely fermionic current .",
    "therefore , it was until now implicitly assumed that such a formalism would be sufficient to describe whatever current - carrying string configuration",
    ". it will be shown in this paper that this is in fact not true and an extended version , including more than one parameter , is needed  @xcite .",
    "the state parameter formalism , apart from being irrelevant for fermionic current - carrying strings , can only provide a purely classical description of their dynamics .",
    "this is unfortunate since the most relevant prediction of superconducting cosmic string models in cosmology is the existence of the vorton states discussed above .",
    "these equilibrium configurations of rotating loops are not necessarily stable , and in fact , this is perhaps the most important question to be answered on this topic .",
    "indeed , any theory leading to the the existence of absolutely stable vortons predicts a cosmological catastrophe  @xcite and must be ruled out .",
    "one may therefore end up with a very stringent constraint on particle physics extension of the standard model of electroweak and strong interactions . to decide clearly on this point",
    "requires to investigate both the classical and the quantum stability of vortons .",
    "classical stability has already been established in the case of bosonic carriers  @xcite for whatever equation of state  @xcite on the basis of the one parameter formalism . yet",
    "it will also have to be addressed in the more general context that will be discussed below . in the meantime",
    "it was believed that a quantum treatment was necessary in order to decide on the quantum stability : as one wants to compare the characteristic life - time of a vorton with the age of the universe , quantum effects can turn out to be relevant ; hence the following work in which the simplest of all fermionic witten models is detailed  @xcite that can give rise to both spacelike as well as timelike charge currents , generalizing the usual point of view  @xcite .",
    "let us sketch the lines along which this work is made .",
    "a two - dimensional quantization of the spinor fields involved along a string is performed .",
    "owing to anti - particle exitation states , one can derive the conditions under which the current is of arbitrary kind .",
    "moreover , an equation of state giving the energy per unit length and the tension is obtained that involves four different state parameters which are found to be the number densities of fermions , although three of them only happen to be independent .    in section [ modele ] ,",
    "the model is presented and motivated , and the equations of motion are derived . then in section [ modezero ] , we obtain plane wave solutions along the string by separating transverse and longitudinal dependencies of spinor fields in the vortex .",
    "the zero mode transverse solutions are then constraints to be normalizable in order to represent well defined wave functions .",
    "the quantization restricted to massless longitudinal modes is performed in section [ quantization ] . as a result , the classical conserved currents obtained from noether theorem , like energy - momentum tensor and fermionic currents , are expressed in their quantum form .",
    "all these quantum operators end up being functions of the fermionic occupation numbers only . in the last section ( section [ etat ] ) , the classical expressions for the energy per unit length and the tension are derived and discussed from computation of quantum observable values of the stress tensor operator in the classical limit .",
    "contrary to the bosonic current - carrier case where there is only one state parameter  @xcite , the classical limit of the model involves four state parameters in order to fully determine the energy per unit length and the tension .",
    "the cosmological consequences of this new analysis are briefly discussed in the concluding section .",
    "we are going to be interested in the purely dynamical effects a fermionic current flowing along a cosmic string may have .",
    "the model we will be dealing with here is a simplified version of that proposed by witten  @xcite which involves two kinds of fermions , in the neutral limit .",
    "this limit , for which the coupling between fermions and electromagnetic - like external fields is made to vanish , permits an easy recognition of the dynamical effects of the existence of an internal structure as in ref .",

    "the present toy model does not involve the effect of the radius of curvature @xmath385 of the string , and it is reasonable that the contribution of the zero mode vacuum to the energy per unit length involves @xmath385 through a redefinition of @xmath297 . if @xmath297 becomes smaller than @xmath154 , the first discrete values of the fermion densities could be inside the hatched regions in fig .",
    "[ figuiposip ] , since the discrete values of the fermion densities only depend on the physical length of the string @xmath154 .",

    "such effects could be relevant for vorton stability , as , for a small radius of curvature , the string could become unstable to fermion condensation .",
    "finally , the model can be used only at the tree order , and the conditions ( [ domainok ] ) and ( [ devlimok ] ) are the validity criteria of the above derivations .",
    "owing to the fermionic two - dimensional quantization along the string , the energy per unit length and the tension of a string carrying massless fermionic currents have been derived up to the first order in backreaction corrections .",
    "the state of the string is found to be well defined with four state parameters which are the densities of each fermion trapped in the string , and asymmetry angles between particles and anti - particles in each fermion family .",
    "it seems quite different than the bosonic charge carriers case , where the current magnitude is the only relevant state parameter  @xcite , however , this is the result of the allowed purely classical approach where the superposition of many quantum states can be view as only one classical state owing to the bosonic nature of the charge carriers . as a result",
    ", there is a degeneracy between the number of bosons trapped in the string and the charge current .",
    "the quantization introduced to deal with fermions naturally leads to separate the charge current from the particle current through the existence of anti - particle exitations .",
    "moreover , the magnitude of the current can only modify the equation of state at non - zeroth order because the chiral nature of fermions trapped in the string requires simultaneous exitations between the two families to lead to non - lightlike charge currents .",
    "nevertheless , some global comparisons can be made with the scalar case .",
    "first , for reasonable values of @xmath386 , the energy per unit length grows with the fermionic densities , whereas the tension decreases with them .",
    "however , note the relevant parameter for the change in behaviors of the tension and line density energy is the function @xmath326 instead of the current magnitude in the scalar case",
    ". as it was said , @xmath340 quantifies , through the asymmetry between the number of particles and anti - particles trapped in the string , the efficiency of the charge current per particle to be timelike or spacelike .",
    "the more positive is @xmath340 , the more timelike the fermionic charge current per particle will be , and conversely the more negative @xmath340 is , the more spacelike it will be . once again , this difference with the scalar case appears as a result of the degeneracy breaking between particle current and charge current due to the fermionic nature of the charge carriers .",
    "the stability of the string with respect to transverse perturbations is given from the macroscopic formalism by the sign of the tension ( for line density energy positive )  @xcite , and we find that instabilities always occur for densities roughly close to @xmath387 , in finite domain for timelike current , in infinite one for spacelike currents with @xmath361 .",
    "another new results are obtained from the multi - dimensional properties of the equation of state , in particular the problem of stability with respect to longitudinal perturbations differs from the scalar barotropic case where the longitudinal perturbations propagation speed is given by @xmath388  @xcite , and therefore its two - dimensional form has to be derived to conclude on these kinds of instabilities .",
    "nevertheless , by analogy with the scalar case , since , in the non - perturbed case and in the infinite string limit , the equation of state verifies @xmath389  @xcite , the longitudinal perturbation propagation speed might be close to the speed of the light , even with small backreaction , and therefore , only transverse stability would be relevant in macroscopic string stability with massless fermionic currents .",
    "the energy per unit length and the tension of a cosmic string carrying fermionic massless currents were derived in the frame of the witten model in the neutral limit .",
    "contrary to bosonic charge carriers , the two - dimensional quantization required to deal with fermions , leads to more than one state parameter in order to yield a well - defined equation of state .",
    "they can be chosen , at zeroth order , as fermion densities trapped in the string regardless of charge conjugation .",
    "the minimal backreaction correction appears through the fermionic charge current magnitude which involves the asymmetry angles between the number of particles and anti - particles trapped in the string , and which might be identified with the baryonic number of the plasma in which the string was formed during the phase transition . as a result , it is shown that fermionic charge currents can be lightlike , spacelike as well as timelike . moreover the line energy density and the tension evolve globally as in the bosonic charge carriers case , but it was found that the tension can take negative values in extreme regions where the fermion densities are close to the string mass , and where the string is therefore unstable with respect to transverse perturbations according to the macroscopic formalism .    the present model has been built on the generic existence of fermionic zero modes in the string and follows only a semi - classical approach .",
    "it is no longer valid for higher corrections in the backreaction when they modify notably the vortex background and seem to give effective mass to the previous zero modes .",
    "it may be conjectured , at this stage , that in a full quantum theory , the quantum loop corrections give mass to the zero modes for high currents and consequently might lead to their decay by the mean of massive states .",
    "only chiral charge currents could be stable on cosmic string carrying large fermionic massless currents in such a case .",
    "another possible effect , relevant for vortons stability , may be expected for loops with small radius of curvature , by means of the vacuum effects which could render the loop unstable to fermion condensation .",
    "it will be interesting to quantify such modifications on the equation of state in future works , as the effects of worldsheet curvature , and the modification of the density line energy and tension by the massive bound states .",
    "the field of validity of the model could therefore be extended to higher energy scales which would be more relevant for vortons and string formation .",
