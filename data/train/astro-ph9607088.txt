    "since the discovery four years ago of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) fluctuations ( smoot _ et al . _",
    "1992 ) , the data from anisotropy experiments have improved in both quality and quantity at a very rapid pace .",
    "cmb data already provide stringent constraints on cosmological models , and with a plethora of balloon - borne and ground - based experiments underway and two planned satellite missions , we can expect further dramatic improvement over the next decade .",
    "in fact , there is a very real possibility that we will accurately measure many of the most important cosmological parameters via the cmb anisotropy spectrum ( jungman _ et al . _  1996 ,",
    "kosowsky _ et al . _",
    "1996 ) .    in order to realize this promise",
    ", we must take great care in developing tools for comparing observational data with theoretical predictions .",
    "even with existing data , this process is far from trivial , and with the much larger data sets of the near future the task will become trickier .",
    "there are at least two independent problems to be faced : we must be able to make accurate predictions of the anisotropy spectrum for any particular theory , and we must develop adequate statistical techniques to facilitate the comparison of these predictions with observations .",
    "these lectures are concerned with these two subjects .",
    "we will first review the primary physical mechanisms that are thought to be responsible for generating cmb anisotropies .",
    "the emphasis in this half of the lectures will be on building an intuitive picture of the relevant physical effects .",
    "we will therefore give ourselves free rein to make physically motivated approximations , rather than trying to treat the rather involved subject of anisotropy formation with complete precision .",
    "this section of the lectures will draw heavily on the work of wayne hu and naoshi sugiyama ( hu & sugiyama 1994 , 1995a , 1995b , 1996 ; hu 1995 ) , as well as on a review article by hu , sugiyama , & silk ( 1996 ) and two previous summer - school proceedings on the subject ( hu 1996 , tegmark 1996c ) .",
    "the second half of these lectures is devoted to issues of statistics and data analysis .",
    "we will study various ways in which theoretical predictions of cmb anisotropy may be compared with data sets .",
    "our primary focus will be on methods for analyzing the cobe dmr data , since this is the largest and most powerful cmb data set in existence ; however , many of the issues that arise in analyzing the cobe data are directly relevant to analyses of other experiments , both present and future .",
    "for example , we will pay special attention to the issue of _ data compression _ ; this subject was fairly important in analyzing the cobe data , and its importance will only increase as cmb data sets get larger and larger .",
    "in particular , the planned map and cobras / samba missions will both return data sets several orders of magnitude larger than cobe , and their analysis will therefore require extensive data compression .",
    "these lectures are organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : overview ] provides an overview of the key physical processes that produce cmb anisotropy .",
    "section [ sec : primary ] discusses the primary anisotropy , including the sachs - wolfe effect ( sachs & wolfe 1967 ) and anisotropies produced by acoustic oscillations of the photon - baryon fluid ( peebles & yu 1970 ; doroshkevich , zeldovich , & sunyaev 1978 ; bond & efstathiou 1984 ) , as well as the diffusive damping of fluctuations ( silk 1968 ) . in section",
    "[ sec : secondary ] we discuss anisotropies produced after last scattering , such as the integrated sachs - wolfe effect ( sachs & wolfe 1967 , rees & sciama 1968 ) , the effect of gravitational lensing ( blandford & narayan 1992 , seljak 1996b ) , and reionization ( sunyaev 1977 , silk 1982 ) . section [ sec : summary1 ] attempts to synthesize the main ideas of the previous sections and concludes the first half of these lectures .",
    "the second half , which concerns issues of statistics and data analysis , begins with section [ sec : stats ] , in which we establish some basic results and notation having to do with gaussian random processes on the sphere . section [ sec : cmbdata ] presents a series of idealized thought experiments designed to introduce some of the key issues of cmb data analysis .",
    "this section also contains a digression on bayesian and frequentist statistical techniques . in section [ sec : cobe ] , we apply what we have learned to an analysis of the four - year cobe dmr data , and section [ sec : summary ] contains some brief concluding remarks .",
    "cmb anisotropies encode large amounts of information about the universe .",
    "physical processes around the redshift of last scattering ( typically @xmath2 ) produce the _ primary anisotropy _ , which can be significantly altered by _",
    "secondary _ processes between the last - scattering surface and the present .",
    "in addition , the angular scale subtended by a particular source of anisotropy depends on the spatial geometry as well as the distance to the last - scattering surface .    with the exception of some effects at very low redshift , and ignoring topological defect models ,",
    "calculations of cmb anisotropy are done in linear perturbation theory .",
    "all of the relevant quantities are small perturbations about a homogeneous friedmann - robertson - walker solution . nonetheless , making accurate numerical predictions of the cmb anisotropy in a particular theory is a daunting numerical task . in a typical cold dark matter ( cdm )",
    "model , the variables one must keep track of include    * @xmath3 , the baryon density perturbation . *",
    "@xmath4 , the perturbation in the cdm density . *",
    "@xmath5 , the baryon peculiar velocity field . *",
    "@xmath6 , the cdm peculiar velocity field . * @xmath7 , essentially the newtonian gravitational potential . *",
    "@xmath8 , the perturbation to the spatial curvature . and @xmath8 are the only important perturbations to the metric .",
    "@xmath7 is related to the perturbation to the time - time component @xmath9 of the metric , and @xmath8 has to do with the perturbation to the spatial part @xmath10 . for more information on gauges ,",
    "see the contribution of j .-",
    "sanz to this volume , and also hu ( 1995 , 1996 ) and references therein . ]",
    "* @xmath11 , the photon phase - space distribution function . *",
    "@xmath12 , the neutrino phase - space distribution function .",
    "all of these quantities depend on position @xmath13 and time @xmath14 , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are also momentum - dependent",
    ". their evolution is governed by a nasty set of coupled partial differential equations . for the nonrelativistic species , we must keep track of the usual equations of perturbation theory , namely the continuity equation , the euler equation , and the poisson equation . for the cdm",
    ", these equations look like @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the scale factor , @xmath17 is the average density , and a dot denotes a time derivative .",
    "all spatial derivatives are taken with respect to comoving coordinates . in the last equation",
    ", @xmath18 represents the total density perturbation , although we will generally consider models that are gravitationally dominated by cdm , so that we can replace @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "there are also continuity and euler equations for the baryons , the latter containing a pressure term .",
    "the relativistic species ( photons and neutrinos ) are not characterized by a simple velocity field , but by a distribution function whose evolution is governed by the boltzmann equation , @xmath20.\\ ] ] here @xmath21 is the magnitude of the momentum , @xmath22 is a direction cosine of the momentum , and @xmath23 is a collision term having to do with scattering .",
    "this equation applies to both @xmath11 and @xmath12 , although at the epochs we are interested in the neutrino collision term is zero .    in order to make accurate predictions of the cmb anisotropy in a particular model , it is necessary to solve this system of equations numerically .",
    "if we work in fourier space , we find that different fluctuation modes are uncoupled and the solution is therefore greatly simplified .",
    "we write @xmath24 and similarly for the other quantities .",
    "[ for the distribution functions , it is convenient to make a second expansion in legendre polynomials @xmath25 . ]",
    "the fact that different @xmath26-modes decouple makes the problem computationally tractable .",
    "furthermore , as we shall see , the fact that we can work with one mode at a time makes it easier to get a conceptual understanding of anisotropy formation .    in recent years",
    "excellent codes have been developed for integrating these equations .",
    "et al . _  ( 1995 ) and bond ( 1996 ) for fairly recent discussions of the state of the art , and seljak & zaldarriaga ( 1996 ) for an important subsequent development . ]",
    "we will not discuss the details of such precise calculations here ; rather , we will follow a less precise but more intuitive picture of the formation of anisotropies , based on a series of physically motivated approximations .",
    "this approach makes it easier to see what the important physical processes are and also gives us an understanding of how various features in the anisotropy spectrum depend on key cosmological parameters .",
    "we will begin by discussing the sources of primary anisotropy : the sachs - wolfe effect ( sachs & wolfe  1967 ) , which describes gravitational red- and blueshifts due to potential differences on the surface of last scattering ; the doppler effect due to bulk motions of the last - scattering surface ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1970 ) ; and intrinsic temperature variations from point to point ( silk 1967 ) .",
    "we will then discuss some sources of secondary anisotropy , the most important of which is the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect , which describes energy changes in photons as they pass through time - varying potentials .",
    "[ this effect was also treated by sachs & wolfe ( 1967 ) , as well as by rees & sciama ( 1968 ) at nearly the same time . ]",
    "other secondary sources of anisotropy include scattering by reionized matter and gravitational lensing .    at first",
    ", we will consider the evolution of only one fourier mode at a time ; however , we will eventually need to synthesize all of the different fourier modes together to see what the total cmb anisotropy on the sky looks like . to do that",
    ", we will need to know the _ power spectrum _ of the density perturbation .",
    "this is simply the mean - square amplitude of the various fourier modes : @xmath27 ( as long as space is isotropic , @xmath28 depends only on the magnitude of @xmath29 . ) the angle brackets here denote an ensemble average , although it is frequently acceptable to assume @xmath18 is ergodic , in which case the angle brackets can equally well be regarded as a spatial average . as a random field on the sphere , we may _ not _ assume ergodicity : @xmath30 is never ergodic . ]",
    "we often assume that the initial power spectrum is a power law in @xmath31 : @xmath32 .",
    "as we will see below , the analogous quantity for describing the observed cmb anisotropy is the _ angular power spectrum _ :",
    "@xmath33 here @xmath34 is a coefficient of an expansion of a spherical harmonic expansion of the temperature anisotropy ( spherical harmonic expansions being the natural analogue of fourier expansions for data sets that live on the sphere ) .",
    "a mode with spherical harmonic index @xmath35 probes an angular scale on the sky of @xmath36 . in any particular cosmological model , the angular power spectrum @xmath37 is related linearly to the matter power spectrum @xmath38 .",
    "the angular power spectrum for a cdm model is shown in figure [ fig : scdm ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : scdm ] ( and all of the other power spectrum plots we will see ) is traditional . in a flat cosmological model with an @xmath39 power spectrum ,",
    "the sachs - wolfe contribution to the power spectrum is proportional to @xmath40 .",
    "the sachs - wolfe effect dominates on large scales , explaining the flatness of figure [ fig : scdm ] at low @xmath35 .",
    "the quantity @xmath41 is also approximately proportional to the total power per logarithmic interval in @xmath35 .",
    "( to make this proportionality exact , one would use @xmath42 instead . ) ] the primary goal of section [ sec : primary ] will be to explain the multiple peaks in this spectrum .",
    "we will begin by assuming that , after the end of the radiation epoch , most of the mass in the universe is in the form of cold dark matter : @xmath43 then the gravitational potential is completely determined by the cdm , and three equations ( [ eq : cont]@xmath44[eq : poisson ] ) can be solved for @xmath7 and @xmath18 without worrying about what the other species are doing .",
    "then , once we know the gravitational potential @xmath7 , we can solve for the evolution of the photons and baryons .",
    "equations ( [ eq : cont]@xmath44[eq : poisson ] ) can be combined into a single second - order equation for @xmath18 , @xmath45 at early times , when the universe is radiation dominated , the last term in this equation is negligible , and the two linearly independent solutions are @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "there is therefore little growth during the radiation era .",
    "if the universe is matter dominated ( meaning that both radiation and curvature are negligible in the friedmann equation ) , then we have @xmath48 , and the solutions are @xmath49 and @xmath50 . at late times",
    ", of course , the growing mode is the one that matters .",
    "if we plug the matter - dominated growing - mode solution into the poisson equation ( [ eq : poisson ] ) , we find that _",
    "@xmath7 is independent of time_. this is a key fact , to which we will return repeatedly",
    ".      now that we know what the gravitational potential is doing , we are ready to study the evolution of the photons and baryons .",
    "we do this by making another approximation : we assume _ tight coupling _ between photons and baryons .",
    "specifically , we assume that the mean free time @xmath51 between photon collisions is small compared to the other important time scales : @xmath52 here @xmath53 is the expansion time scale , @xmath54 is the light - travel time across a fourier mode , and @xmath55 is the sound - travel time across a mode ( @xmath56 being the sound speed ) .",
    "this is an excellent approximation right up until around the time of last scattering .    in the tight - coupling approximation ,",
    "frequent scattering isotropizes the photon distribution function @xmath11 : at any particular point , @xmath11 is isotropic in the rest frame of the baryons at that point .",
    "in fact , @xmath11 is completely characterized by the temperature distribution .",
    "furthermore , the photon and baryon densities are coupled adiabatically : @xmath57 .",
    "the behavior of the photon - baryon fluid is therefore characterized by a single variable : if we know , say , @xmath58 , we can determine @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath11",
    ". we will find it convenient to take as our variable the fractional temperature fluctuation , which is simply one third of the baryon density fluctuation : @xmath61    with these approximations , the dynamics of the photon - baryon fluid is described by the single equation @xmath62+{k^2\\over",
    "3}\\theta = f(\\eta ) .",
    "\\label{eq : master}\\ ] ] this equation comes from the euler and continuity equations for the fluid .",
    "we are working in units in which @xmath63 . for a derivation of this equation ,",
    "see hu ( 1995 ) . in this equation , @xmath64 is the conformal time , @xmath65 and @xmath66 is essentially the baryon - to - photon energy ratio .",
    "the overdot denotes a derivative with respect to conformal time .",
    "this equation is in fourier space , so @xmath67 represents a single fourier mode with wavenumber @xmath29 .",
    "odious as this practice is , i have bowed to convention in these lectures . ]",
    "the right - hand side @xmath68 is a gravitational driving term , @xmath69.\\ ] ]    the rest of this section will be devoted almost entirely to a discussion of the solution of equation  ( [ eq : master ] ) .",
    "we begin by making some useful observations .",
    "first , @xmath70 where @xmath1 is the hubble parameter in units of @xmath71 , @xmath72 is the redshift , and @xmath73 is the baryonic contribution to the density parameter .",
    "so for standard recombination at @xmath74 and baryon densities around the nucleosynthesis range , @xmath75 at the time of last scattering .    with the approximations that we re making ,",
    "there are no anisotropic stresses , so the two gravitational potentials are simply related to each other : @xmath76 furthermore , we have seen that during the matter - dominated epoch , if linear theory is valid , @xmath7 is independent of time .",
    "the gravitational driving term therefore simplifies to @xmath77      to develop an intuitive feel for the solutions to equation ( [ eq : master ] ) , we will start by making some excessive and unwarranted approximations .",
    "we will then gradually relax those approximations to get a more accurate picture .",
    "first , let s assume that @xmath78 and @xmath7 are independent of time .",
    "then @xmath79 this is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator , with solution @xmath80 here @xmath81 and @xmath82 are constants to be fixed by the initial conditions and @xmath83 is the sound speed . in this approximation",
    ", then , each fourier mode represents an acoustic plane wave propagating at speed @xmath56 .",
    "there is a simple physical picture underlying this result .",
    "the baryon - photon fluid wants to fall into the potential wells , but it is supported by radiation pressure .",
    "the balance between pressure and gravity sets up acoustic oscillations .",
    "the three terms in equation ( [ eq : master ] ) come from the inertia of the fluid , the radiation pressure , and the gravitational field .",
    "in fact , let s make things even simpler and set @xmath84 .",
    "then @xmath85 in many theories , the initial perturbation is _ adiabatic _ , meaning that the matter and radiation fluctuations are the same at any particular point . with these initial conditions , @xmath86 at very early times , and @xmath87 ,",
    "so @xmath88    continuing to focus our attention on a single fourier mode , let us determine what kind of anisotropy we would expect to see on the sky .",
    "as we have mentioned , the three sources of primary anisotropy are gravity , the doppler effect , and intrinsic temperature variations , @xmath89_{\\eta = \\eta_{\\rm ls } } , \\label{eq : primary}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 is the time of last scattering and @xmath91 is a unit vector in the direction of observation .    ignoring the doppler term for the moment ,",
    "note that the other two terms give a pure cosine oscillation , @xmath92 so the r.m.s .",
    "@xmath30 is large when @xmath93 is an integer multiple of @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , if the initial conditions have a smooth power spectrum , @xmath30 will have a harmonic series of peaks in @xmath31-space , leading to a harmonic series in the angular power spectrum of anisotropy on the sky .",
    "this is the origin of the so - called `` doppler peaks '' in figure [ fig : scdm ] .",
    "ironically , the peaks have nothing to do with the doppler effect .",
    "in fact , the peaks are caused by modes that have reached maxima of compression and rarefaction at the time of last scattering ; the doppler contribution to the anisotropy in these modes is zero !",
    "the first peak is caused by modes that have had time to oscillate through exactly one half of a period before last scattering ; the modes that cause the second peak have oscillated through a full period , and so on .",
    "the physical scale of the first peak is therefore @xmath95 the distance to the last - scattering surface is @xmath96 , so the angular scale of the first peak is @xmath97",
    ". we will be more precise about the correspondence between physical scales and angular scales later .",
    "earlier , we threw out the doppler term in equation ( [ eq : primary ] ) for no particular reason .",
    "we had better put it back . using the continuity equation ( [ eq : cont ] ) and the relation @xmath98 , we find that @xmath99 here @xmath100 is a unit vector in the direction of @xmath101 and @xmath102 and @xmath18 are still in fourier space .",
    "differentiating equation ( [ eq : simplestsol ] ) and using the fact that @xmath103 for @xmath84 , we find that @xmath104 . since the r.m.s .",
    "value of @xmath105 is @xmath106 , the r.m.s .",
    "doppler contribution to equation ( [ eq : primary ] ) is @xmath107_{\\hbox{\\scriptsize doppler}}= { i\\over 3}\\psi\\sin kc_s\\eta .",
    "\\label{eq : doppler}\\ ] ] this has the same amplitude as the @xmath108 contribution , but is @xmath109 out of phase in both time ( it goes like a sine instead of a cosine ) and space ( it has an extra factor of @xmath110 ) .",
    "this has the rather disastrous consequence of completely erasing the doppler peaks : the total @xmath30 is the quadrature sum of ( [ eq : thetapsi ] ) and ( [ eq : doppler ] ) : @xmath111 the @xmath31 dependence , which led to the peaks , is gone .",
    "the problem , of course , is that we have taken our approximations too far .",
    "specifically , the culprit is the limit @xmath112 .",
    "physically , taking the limit @xmath112 means ignoring the dynamical effects of the baryons .",
    "let us remove that assumption , but keep the approximation that @xmath78 is time - independent .",
    "then the solution for @xmath113 changes in two ways .",
    "the sound speed gets smaller by a factor @xmath114 , and the driving term @xmath68 gets bigger by a factor @xmath115 .",
    "the adiabatic solution to equation ( [ eq : master ] ) is now @xmath116    by allowing @xmath78 to be nonzero , we have increased the amplitude of the cosine oscillations by a factor @xmath117 .",
    "furthermore , there is now an offset in the combined sachs - wolfe and adiabatic contributions to @xmath30 : in the limit @xmath112 , we found that @xmath118 oscillated symmetrically about zero ; now it oscillates about @xmath119 .",
    "most important , a nonzero @xmath78 reduces the amplitude of the doppler contribution to the anisotropy , relative to the sachs - wolfe contribution , since @xmath120 is proportional to @xmath121 and @xmath56 has gotten smaller . since the cosine oscillations are now larger in amplitude than the sine oscillations , we do indeed expect to see a series of peaks at @xmath122 .    why does including the dynamical effect of the baryons effect these changes in the solution ?",
    "the essential reason is that baryons contribute to the _ effective mass _ of the photon - baryon fluid , but not to the _ pressure_. ( this is clear from looking at equation ( [ eq : master ] ) : the first term , representing the effective mass , depends on @xmath78 , but the second term , representing pressure support , does not . )",
    "the effect of the baryons , therefore , is to slow down the oscillations , and also to make the fluid fall deeper into the potential wells .",
    "this explains all three of the key effects we have just mentioned : the increased oscillation amplitude , the offset in the center of the oscillations , and the reduction in importance of the velocity term relative to the other terms .",
    "these effects are represented pictorially in figure [ fig : cartoonbaryon ] .",
    "based on this analysis , we can predict that the height of the peaks in the cmb anisotropy spectrum should depend on the baryon density : the larger the baryon density , the larger @xmath78 , and the greater the amplitude of the oscillations . furthermore , because of the offset in the oscillations , we expect the odd - numbered peaks to be enhanced relative to the even - numbered ones .",
    "( in the language of figure [ fig : cartoonbaryon ] , the compressions produce larger anisotropies than the rarefactions . of course",
    ", if we had chosen to draw a potential peak instead of a potential well in figure [ fig : cartoonbaryon ] , we would make precisely the opposite statement . )    both of these effects are found in detailed calculations and can be seen in figure [ fig : clbaryon ] .",
    "we can make further refinements to these approximations without too much difficulty .",
    "for instance , we can allow @xmath78 to vary with time .",
    "the time scale on which @xmath78 varies is of order a hubble time and is much longer than the period of the acoustic waves .",
    "we can therefore treat the variation of @xmath78 ( and the concomitant variation in @xmath56 ) in the wkb approximation .",
    "there are two main results .",
    "first , the phase of the oscillation changes from @xmath123 to @xmath124 .",
    "second , the amplitude of the oscillations grows with time in proportion to @xmath125 , or @xmath126 .",
    "is an adiabatic invariant for a harmonic oscillator . here",
    "@xmath127 is the mass , @xmath128 is the amplitude , and @xmath129 is the frequency . of course",
    ", the result can also be derived directly from the wkb approximation . ]",
    "we can also relax the approximation that @xmath68 is constant in time .",
    "this has interesting consequences . a constant term on the right - hand side of an oscillator equation merely offsets the center of the oscillations ; in contrast , a time - varying term genuinely drives oscillations . in particular ,",
    "if the driving term varies significantly on a time scale comparable to the period of the oscillations , resonant driving can occur .",
    "we have seen that @xmath7 ( and hence @xmath130 ) is constant during matter domination , but it decays during the radiation epoch . for modes that enter the horizon before matter domination , @xmath7 decays while that mode is undergoing its oscillations .",
    "the decay in @xmath7 therefore boosts the amplitude of those short - wavelength modes .",
    "the modes that receive the largest boost are those that entered the horizon before matter - radiation equality at a redshift @xmath131 these modes are characterized by wavenumbers @xmath132    the effect of the driving term becomes evident if we look at power spectra for critical - density models with different values of the hubble parameter : for low @xmath1 , matter domination occurs later and the boosting effect is greater .",
    "this effect is shown in figure [ fig : clh ] .",
    "we have been focusing on models with adiabatic initial conditions .",
    "if we instead consider _ isocurvature _ models , the effect of the driving term becomes even more evident . in isocurvature models",
    ", the total density perturbation vanishes at early times : @xmath133 clearly @xmath134 in these models .",
    "as time passes , @xmath135 redshifts away , leaving genuine density perturbations and hence nonzero potentials @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "oscillations are therefore driven in @xmath136 .",
    "in contrast to the adiabatic case , these isocurvature oscillations are proportional to @xmath137 rather than @xmath138 . the peaks in an isocurvature spectrum are therefore different in phase from adiabatic peaks .",
    "the peak locations in the cmb anisotropy spectrum can distinguish quite robustly between adiabatic and isocurvature models .",
    "figure [ fig : cartooniso ] illustrates the origin of the peaks in isocurvature models .",
    "we have been assuming so far that the tight - coupling approximation holds perfectly right up until the moment @xmath90 , and that the photons are instantaneously released at that moment .",
    "in fact , the failure of the tight - coupling approximation , especially around the time of last scattering , causes significant damping of fluctuations as photons diffuse out of hot , overdense regions .",
    "furthermore , the last - scattering `` surface '' is really a shell of some thickness .",
    "oscillations on scales smaller than this thickness do not show up as observable anisotropies on the sky , since any particular line of sight will look at multiple peaks and troughs of that mode .    to get a rough estimate of the importance of diffusion damping ( also known as silk damping ) , consider a photon undergoing a random walk through the photon - baryon fluid .",
    "if the mean free path is @xmath139 , then at a time @xmath64 , a typical photon has scattered about @xmath140 times and has diffused through a distance @xmath141 . if a particular fourier mode has a wavelength less than this diffusion length , then the photons will have diffused from overdense to underdense regions , and the mode will be damped away .",
    "diffusion damping thus occurs for modes with @xmath142 .",
    "most of the damping occurs around the time of last scattering , since that is when the mean free path @xmath139 becomes large .    in figure",
    "[ fig : onemode ] we show the time evolution of a particular mode , including the damping at the end , and in figure [ fig : decomp ] below we show the net effect of diffusion damping on a cmb power spectrum .      in order to complete the story of primary anisotropies",
    ", we need to specify precisely how a particular plane wave is projected onto a specific angular scale on the sky .",
    "it is clear that a mode with wavelength @xmath139 will show up on an angular scale @xmath143 , where @xmath78 is the distance to the last - scattering surface , or in other words , a mode with wavenumber @xmath31 shows up at multipoles @xmath144 .",
    "consequently , tilting the spectral index @xmath145 of the primordial matter power spectrum essentially just tilts the angular power spectrum .",
    "let us now make this rough observation mathematically precise .",
    "if we are looking in a direction @xmath91 in the sky , then ( ignoring the thickness of the last - scattering surface ) , the anisotropy we see is simply @xmath146 , where @xmath147 includes all three terms in equation ( [ eq : primary ] ) . for a single fourier mode , this is simply @xmath148 to quantify the amount of power this produces on different angular scales , we expand in spherical harmonics @xmath149 . the relevant identity is ( jackson 1975 ) @xmath150 combining equations ( [ eq : onemode - real ] ) and ( [ eq : ylmident ] ) , we find that @xmath151 where @xmath152 the total power produced by this mode in the multipole @xmath35 is @xmath153 the spherical bessel function @xmath154 peaks at @xmath155 , so a single fourier mode @xmath29 does indeed contribute most of its power around multipole @xmath156 , as expected . however , as figure [ fig : bessj ] shows , @xmath157 does have significant power beyond the first peak , meaning that the power contributed by a fourier mode `` bleeds '' to @xmath35-values lower than @xmath158 .",
    "this is due to the fact that a mode appears to have a longer wavelength when looked at along a line of sight nearly perpendicular to the wavevector .",
    "these formulae assume that the universe is spatially flat . if there is curvature , then the correspondence between physical scales at last scattering and angular scales on the sky changes . in an open universe , for example",
    ", geodesics focus in such a way that a particular angular scale corresponds to a much larger physical scale on the last - scattering surface .",
    "a particular fourier mode in an open universe projects to multipoles @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is the _ angular - diameter distance _ to the last - scattering surface , given by @xmath161 here @xmath162 is the curvature .",
    "when @xmath163 is small , @xmath164 , but for large @xmath163 ( low @xmath0 ) , @xmath160 grows exponentially with metric distance .",
    "this projection effect is easy to see in predictions of the cmb anisotropy . in an open universe ,",
    "features such as the acoustic peaks and the damping scale are shifted towards smaller angular scales , _",
    "i.e. _ , towards higher @xmath35 .",
    "( see figure [ fig : clopen ] . )",
    "note that the approximate linear relation between @xmath35 and @xmath31 holds only for primary anisotropies .",
    "the secondary anisotropies , which we discuss below , tend to occur at a wide range of distances ( in contrast to the relatively thin last - scattering surface ) .",
    "thus for secondary anisotropies , each @xmath31-mode can contribute to a wide range of @xmath35 s .",
    "after last scattering , the photons and baryons are no longer tightly coupled .",
    "in fact , if the effects of reionization are negligible , there is no coupling at all . in this case",
    ", the photons simply propagate freely along spacetime geodesics from last scattering to the observer .",
    "the causes of secondary anisotropy are then entirely gravitational , the dominant effect being the isw effect .",
    "weak gravitational lensing can also distort the anisotropy spectrum , although this effect is generally small .",
    "if the intergalactic medium reionized at a sufficiently early redshift , then some fraction of the photons will interact again after the time of `` last '' scattering .",
    "the main result is that primary fluctuations are erased , and in addition new fluctuations can be generated from the new last - scattering surface .",
    "however , the last - scattering surface in a reionized model is extremely thick ( since the photon - baryon coupling is weak ) , so the nature of the regenerated anisotropy is quite different from the primary anisotropy .      as sachs & wolfe ( 1967 ) showed ,",
    "fluctuations in the spacetime curvature produce cmb anisotropy in two distinct ways .",
    "the `` ordinary '' sachs - wolfe effect is simply the gravitational red- or blueshift due to the potential difference between the points of emission and reception of a photon .",
    "in addition , if the gravitational potential changes with time , there is an `` integrated '' sachs - wolfe effect .",
    "imagine a photon falling into a potential well , and then climbing out the other side .",
    "if the potential does not vary with time , the photon suffers no net change in energy .",
    "however , if the potential well decays while the photon is passing through it , then the redshift upon climbing out of the well is smaller than the blueshift upon falling in .",
    "the photon therefore gains energy .",
    "the magnitude of the isw effect is given by an integral along the photon s path : @xmath165    we observed earlier that the gravitational potential is time - independent if certain conditions are satisfied :    * the universe is matter - dominated ( @xmath166 ) .",
    "* spatial curvature is negligible ( @xmath167 ) . *",
    "linear perturbation theory is valid ( @xmath168 ) .",
    "if all of these conditions are satisfied , there is no isw effect .",
    "however , in any realistic cosmological model some or all of these conditions are violated at some point .      in a typical model ,",
    "the epoch of matter - radiation equality occurs before the time of last scattering , but not long before .",
    "the matter - dominated limit is therefore not quite correct around the time of last scattering and shortly thereafter .",
    "the decay in the potential shortly after last scattering gives rise to the early isw effect .",
    "this effect is largest when the matter density @xmath169 is low .",
    "the early isw effect is most important on large scales .",
    "specifically , the scales that are most affected are those with @xmath170 comparable to the time scale on which the potential decays .",
    "modes with wavelengths much shorter than this oscillate many times while the potential is decaying , causing both positive and negative isw contributions , which tend to cancel each other out .",
    "the time scale for potential decay is of order the horizon size at last scattering , so the early isw effect shows up on large angular scales @xmath171 .      in models with @xmath172 ,",
    "the potential decays at late times , typically at redshifts @xmath173 .",
    "this potential decay , which occurs whether or not there is a cosmological constant , gives rise to an isw effect at late times . as with the early isw effect , modes with wavelengths comparable to the time scale for the potential to decay are most affected .",
    "the relevant time scale is the horizon size at the time of potential decay , so the late isw effect also leaves its imprint on large angular scales .      at very late times , nonlinear structure forms , causing the potential to grow with time . the isw effect due to nonlinear structure",
    "is often called the _ rees - sciama effect _ ( rees & sciama 1968 ) . in standard models ,",
    "the rees - sciama effect is typically much weaker than the other effects we have discussed ( seljak 1996a ) .",
    "a background of primordial gravity waves , if there is one , produces its own isw effect .",
    "gravity waves redshift once they enter the horizon , so modes that enter the horizon well before last scattering leave no imprint on the cmb . the gravity - wave contribution to",
    "the cmb anisotropy therefore occurs on large angular scales @xmath174 .",
    "because of the quadrupolar nature of the spacetime distortion caused by a gravity wave , the gravity - wave contribution to the cmb quadrupole is enhanced relative to other modes",
    ".    there may be other sources of spacetime distortion besides linear density fluctuations and gravity waves .",
    "in particular , topological defects cause spacetime curvature and hence an isw effect . we will not discuss topological defects further ; for more information , see paul shellard s contribution to this volume , and the references therein",
    ".      the isw effect may be thought of as gravity imparting a `` kick '' to a photon forward or backward along the direction of motion .",
    "gravity can also kick the photons in the transverse directions , changing their directions of motion but not their energies .",
    "the result of this weak gravitational lensing is that our image of the last - scattering surface is slightly distorted , as if we were looking at it through an irregular refracting medium .",
    "this distortion of the last - scattering surface results in a slight smearing of the angular power spectrum , with power from the peaks being moved into the valleys .",
    "the effect is typically weak , resulting in changes at the few - percent level in the power spectrum ( seljak 1996b ) .",
    "we will not undertake a detailed discussion of reionized models here .",
    "instead , we refer the interested reader to roman juszkiewicz s contribution to this volume and references therein .",
    "we will , however , make some general comments .    the gunn - peterson test ( gunn & peterson 1965 ) tells us that the intergalactic medium is ionized out to redshifts of a few . in cdm - like models of structure formation",
    ", reionization is generally thought to occur at such moderate redshifts , with the formation of the earliest nonlinear structures .",
    "if this is correct , then reionization does not dramatically alter the cmb anisotropy predictions . if , on the other hand , reionization somehow happened earlier , say at @xmath175 , then a significant fraction of the cmb photons have been scattered by the reionized matter after the so - called epoch of last scattering .",
    "the main effect of such early reionization is to erase anisotropy on degree scales .",
    "the reason is quite simple : if we have early reionization , then a photon that comes toward us from a particular direction need not have originated from that direction .",
    "rather , as figure [ fig : reion ] illustrates , each direction on the sky contains photons that originate from a variety of different locations at the time of `` last '' scattering . in severely reionized models ,",
    "the peaks are completely washed away .",
    "such models may already be ruled out by degree - scale cmb experiments ( scott , silk , & white 1995 ) .",
    "inhomogeneities and bulk motions of the reionized matter induce new cmb anisotropies , which must generally be treated to second order in perturbation theory ( ostriker & vishniac 1986 ; hu , scott , & silk 1994 ; dodelson & jubas 1995 ) , but we will not discuss these regenerated anisotropies here .",
    "we also neglect to discuss the effect of nonuniform or patchy reionization , including the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1970 ) .",
    "we have now concluded our tour of the mechanisms of anisotropy formation .",
    "figure [ fig : decomp ] illustrates some of the key points .",
    "the dominant features in a typical cdm power spectrum are the peaks due to acoustic oscillations of the photon - baryon fluid .",
    "the peaks correspond to modes that are undergoing maximum compression and rarefaction at the time of last scattering .",
    "modes that are out of phase with these modes produce anisotropy via the doppler effect , partially filling in the valleys between the acoustic peaks .",
    "the effect of damping on small scales is evident , and the rise at @xmath176 in the undamped spectrum shows the driving effect of the decaying gravitational potential at early times .",
    "we can use what we have learned to determine how the predicted anisotropy spectrum should depend on the key cosmological parameters :    * in models with _ spatial curvature _",
    "( @xmath172 ) , the position of the acoustic peaks shifts due to geodesic deviation .",
    "in addition , the late isw effect boosts the large - scale power . *",
    "if there is a _ cosmological constant _ , then the position of the peaks shifts slightly due to the increased distance to the last - scattering surface , and again , the late isw effect boosts the large - scale power . * lowering the _ hubble parameter _ ( for fixed @xmath0 ) reduces the matter density .",
    "the gravitational driving of oscillations is enhanced , and the peaks increase in height . * the higher the _ baryon density _ @xmath177 , the greater the peak amplitude .",
    "odd - numbered peaks in particular are enhanced .",
    "* the _ spectral index _",
    "@xmath145 of the primordial power spectrum essentially just tilts the angular power spectrum . *",
    "if we add _ gravity waves _ to a model , we increase the quadrupole , and in addition the whole `` plateau '' at low @xmath35 rises relative to the acoustic peaks .",
    "although we have made many approximations in deriving these conclusions , all of them are borne out by detailed boltzmann calculations .",
    "because the cmb anisotropy predictions depend sensitively on the various parameters , an experiment that could map out the acoustic peaks would be able to measure these cosmological parameters accurately .",
    "the spatial curvature in particular should be relatively easy to pick out , thanks to the shift in position of the first peak .",
    "the relative positions of successive peaks also provide a robust way of determining whether the initial conditions are isocurvature or adiabatic .",
    "the dependence of the power spectrum on other parameters such as @xmath1 and @xmath73 is somewhat more subtle , but if we manage to detect and measure the heights of two or three peaks , we should be able to do quite well ( jungman _ et al . _  1996 ) , assuming , of course , that the general paradigm sketched above is correct and the multiple peaks are really there .",
    "before we discuss methods for comparing theories with data , we need to discuss briefly the statistical properties of the cmb anisotropy as it appears on the sky .",
    "as we have mentioned , it is convenient to expand the observed anisotropy in spherical harmonics : @xmath178 we have focused on the anisotropy produced by an individual plane wave ; the observed anisotropy is of course a superposition of contributions from all of these plane waves : @xmath179 since all of the relevant physics is described by linear perturbation theory  as we know , everything in nature is linear  each @xmath180 is proportional to the initial density perturbation @xmath181 .",
    "one often assumes that the initial conditions have `` random phases , '' meaning that different fourier modes are uncorrelated , @xmath182 in this case , the @xmath180 are also uncorrelated .",
    "the mean - square power in a particular multipole is then simply the sum of the contributions from the various fourier modes : @xmath183 and , of course , the left - hand side of this equation is simply the angular power spectrum @xmath37 .",
    "( this quantity is independent of the azimuthal index @xmath127 as long as space is isotropic . )",
    "we often go beyond the assumption of random phases and assume _ gaussian initial conditions_. this is a prediction of inflationary scenarios , but one often assumes gaussian initial conditions even in non - inflationary phenomenological models such as isocurvature baryon models ( peebles  1987 ) .",
    "when we talk about a gaussian theory , we simply mean that at some initial time @xmath184 the density perturbation @xmath18 was a realization of a gaussian random field .",
    "bernard jones has provided a detailed discussion of gaussian random processes elsewhere in this volume ; for our purposes , all we need to know is that the assumption of gaussian initial conditions , together with homogeneity and isotropy , implies that each fourier coefficient @xmath185 is an independent gaussian random variable of zero mean . in other words , the real - space density perturbation",
    "@xmath186 is a stochastic superposition of plane waves of all different wavelengths . since a gaussian random variable",
    "is completely determined by its mean and variance , and since @xmath187 , the statistical properties of our gaussian random field are completely determined by the power spectrum @xmath188 .    if we assume gaussian initial conditions , then each coefficient @xmath34 is a gaussian random variable , since it is a linear combination of the gaussian variables @xmath185 .",
    "the statistical properties of @xmath30 are therefore completely specified by the means , @xmath189 and the covariances , @xmath190 of the coefficients @xmath34 .",
    "in other words , for gaussian initial conditions , the angular power spectrum @xmath37 tells us everything we need to know .    even when the initial conditions are not gaussian , it often suffices to treat the cmb anisotropy as gaussian , at least on sufficiently large angular scales .",
    "the cmb fluctuation on large angular scales is typically due to a superposition of many incoherent fluctuations .",
    "even if the individual fluctuations fail to be gaussian , the central limit theorem guarantees that the superposition will be approximately gaussian . when comparing the cobe data with the predictions of a cosmic string model , for example",
    ", it is perfectly adequate to treat @xmath30 as gaussian , even though the underlying perturbations are highly non - gaussian .",
    "we will explore the key issues in cmb data analysis by first considering an absurdly idealized experiment ( the sort of thing only a theorist could dream up ) .",
    "we will gradually introduce real - world complications to see what the main issues are .",
    "imagine , then , an experiment that measured @xmath30 at many pixels that cover the entire sky completely and uniformly .",
    "furthermore , imagine that each data point is a perfect , noise - free measurement . with this data set",
    ", we could determine each coefficient @xmath34 with essentially perfect accuracy by inverting equation ( [ eq : ylmexpand ] ) : @xmath191 here @xmath192 is an element of solid angle in the direction of @xmath91 , @xmath193 is the total number of pixels , and @xmath194 is a unit vector in the direction of the @xmath21th pixel .    even in this hopelessly idealized experiment , we still ca nt measure the angular power spectrum @xmath37 perfectly .",
    "the reason is that @xmath37 is an ensemble - average quantity : it is the variance of the distribution from which @xmath34 is drawn .",
    "we have only a finite number , @xmath195 , samples of this distribution at each @xmath35 .",
    "this fact , generally called _ cosmic variance _ , sets a fundamental limit on how well we can ever hope to measure the angular power spectrum . were ergodic ,",
    "then the average value of @xmath196 , measured in different orientations over the sphere , would be the ensemble - average quantity @xmath37 .",
    "but @xmath30 is nt ergodic , so this does nt work . ]",
    "if we assume gaussian statistics , then the best estimator of @xmath37 is simply the average of @xmath196 over @xmath127 : @xmath197 this quantity is chi - squared distributed with @xmath195 degrees of freedom , and so it has a fractional uncertainty of @xmath198 the unfortunate fact , therefore , is that even in a perfect experiment we will never know @xmath37 with a fractional uncertainty better than @xmath199 .",
    "we are stuck with a 63% uncertainty in the quadrupole power @xmath200 and a 30% uncertainty in @xmath201 , although we can in principle hope to determine @xmath202 to 0.3% .",
    "let s mess up our nice , clean experiment by adding noise .",
    "each pixel is no longer a perfect measurement of @xmath30 : the @xmath110th data point @xmath203 consists of a sum of signal and noise , @xmath204 let us assume that the noise @xmath205 in each pixel is independent and gaussian distributed , with some standard deviation @xmath206 .",
    "for the moment we will assume _ homoskedasticity _ , that is , that @xmath206 is the same in all pixels .",
    "we can still try to estimate @xmath34 using equation ( [ eq : almestimate ] ) , @xmath207 and average over @xmath127 to get an estimate of @xmath37 , @xmath208 but this quantity will no longer be a good estimate of the true @xmath37 ; it will be biased upward . using equations ( [ eq : almsum ] ) and ( [ eq : datadef1 ] ) , together with the fact that @xmath209 , it is straightforward to check that @xmath210 the estimator @xmath211 is the average of these quantities , so it too is biased upward by @xmath212 .",
    "we can of course get a better estimate of @xmath37 by subtracting off the noise bias , @xmath213 we now have an unbiased estimator , but unfortunately the uncertainty of @xmath214 has increased : @xmath215      the problem we just considered was a classic example of statistical parameter estimation .",
    "we had some _ data _",
    ", @xmath216 , from which we wanted to estimate a _",
    "parameter _ , @xmath37 .",
    "we did it by choosing an _ estimator _",
    ", @xmath214 , which we could compute from the data , and which we hoped would be close to the true value of the parameter .    in the problem above",
    ", there was a fairly natural choice of an estimator , but in general , for a more complicated problem , there may be no obvious choice .",
    "there is no universal , `` correct '' way to choose an estimator , but in many situations the _ maximum - likelihood _ estimator is a good choice .",
    "we will illustrate maximum - likelihood estimators with a simple example .",
    "suppose that we have @xmath217 data points @xmath218 , each of which is the sum of a signal @xmath219 and some noise @xmath205 .",

    "the maximum - likelihood estimator , as its name suggests , is the value @xmath237 of @xmath224 for which @xmath238 is maximized ( or @xmath239 is minimized ) . in other words , it is the value of the parameter for which it would have been most likely for us to get the data we actually did .    in the problem at hand ,",
    "the maximum - likelihood estimator is found by differentiating @xmath240 with respect to @xmath224 , setting the result equal to zero , and solving for @xmath224 .",
    "the result is @xmath241 that is , we compute the mean - square value of the data points and subtract of the noise bias .",
    "this is precisely what we did when we computed @xmath214 in equation ( [ eq : hatcprime ] ) .",
    "although we did nt know it at the time , we were using a maximum - likelihood estimator .    in this case",
    ", the maximum - likelihood estimator turned out to be unbiased : its ensemble average @xmath242 is equal to the correct value @xmath224 . in general , there is no guarantee that this will happen . to take a simple example",
    ", suppose that we had chosen to estimate the quantity @xmath243 instead of @xmath224 .",
    "the maximum - likelihood estimator would be @xmath244 , and it is easy to see that this quantity is highly positively biased .",
    "now we know how to estimate parameters .",
    "but in most cases an estimator is nt much good without a way of quantifying the uncertainty in it .",
    "methods for doing this generally fall into two categories : the classical or _",
    "frequentist _ approach ( _ e.g. _ , rice 1995 ) and the _ bayesian _ approach ( _ e.g. _ , berger 1985 , gull & daniell 1978 , press 1996 ) .",
    "we will discuss each in turn .    in the frequentist picture , we look at one value of the parameter @xmath224 at a time , and try to determine if that value is so far from our estimator @xmath237 that it is ruled out .",
    "specifically , for each @xmath224 , we compute the probability distribution of the estimator @xmath237 .",
    "we use this probability distribution to determine how likely it is that we would have gotten a value of @xmath237 as far off as we did , or worse .",
    "if the actual value of @xmath237 is far off in the tail of the probability distribution , then this probability will be low .",
    "if the probability lies below some _ significance level _ ( say 5% ) , we say that that value of @xmath224 is ruled out with 5% significance .",
    "we repeat this process for a range of values of @xmath224 , and we say that the set of values that are not ruled out form a 95% _ confidence interval _ for the parameter .    for a frequentist , a value of the parameter is ruled out if there is a low probability of getting data that fits as badly as the actual data .",
    "the bayesian approach is quite different in spirit : a bayesian attempts to determine the subjective probability distribution that characterizes her knowledge of the parameter given the data .",
    "armed with that probability distribution , she can calculate how likely the parameter is to lie in any particular range .    in order to implement the bayesian strategy",
    ", we want to turn the likelihood function @xmath245 , which represents the probability of the data given a value of the parameter , into @xmath246 , the probability of the parameter given the data .",
    "the way to do this is to invoke bayes s theorem : @xmath247 with the constant of proportionality chosen to make the integral of the left - hand side equal one .",
    "the left - hand side of this equation is the _ posterior probability distribution _ , and it is precisely what we are looking for : it tells us the probability of a particular parameter value , given the data .",
    "on the right - hand side we have the product of the likelihood function and the _ prior distribution _ of the parameter @xmath224 .",
    "the latter represents our state of knowledge of @xmath224 before we looked at the data .",
    "a bayesian characterizes the uncertainty in a parameter estimate by drawing a _ credible region _ around the estimate .",
    "a 95% credible region , for example , is an interval @xmath248 such that there is a 95% posterior probability that @xmath224 lies in that interval , @xmath249 the boundaries @xmath250 and @xmath251 of the credible region are typically chosen to have equal values of the posterior probability density .",
    "although the frequentist approach is the one most people think of when they think of statistics , and although most scientists profess to prefer it , many if not most error bars in cosmology are determined using bayesian techniques .",
    "the main objection people raise to the bayesian is that the final results depend on the prior distribution @xmath252 . for a true , orthodox bayesian , this is not really a problem : the bayesian view is that all probabilities represent our subjective knowledge , and that prior distributions are therefore secretly built into all statistical reasoning .",
    "it is better , the argument goes , to have the prior out in the open for all to see .    whether or not you like this argument , there is no denying that in practice choosing a prior can be tricky .",
    "if one has essentially no prior knowledge about the parameter , then the prior distribution should be broad and flat .",
    "[ for a flat prior , we can see from equation ( [ eq : bayes ] ) that the posterior probability distribution is simply the likelihood function . ] but even in this situation , it is not generally obvious which `` flat '' prior to choose .",
    "for example , if we are trying to estimate an element of the power spectrum @xmath37 , should we choose a prior that is flat in @xmath37 or one that is flat in @xmath253 ?",
    "( @xmath37 is after all a mean - square amplitude ; maybe the r.m.s .",
    "amplitude is a more `` natural '' choice . )",
    "perhaps we should even choose a prior that is flat in @xmath254 , since such a prior avoids choosing a preferred scale .",
    "it would be hard to say that any of these choices is `` wrong , '' but in some situations the result of a calculation may depend on which choice is made .",
    "for an example , see bunn _ et al . _  ( 1994 ) .",
    "the situation is not as bad as it appears , however .",
    "if the data set in question contain a good , strong detection of the parameter of interest , then the likelihood function is sharply peaked , and the shape of the posterior probability ( [ eq : bayes ] ) is determined mostly by the likelihood rather than the prior .",
    "prior dependence is thus typically weak in the case of strong detections .",
    "the situations where prior dependence is a serious problem are typically those in which someone is trying to coax a value out of a data set that is capable of only a weak constraint anyway .",
    "we now return to our hypothetical cmb experiment .",
    "the next complication we need to consider has to do with the fact that no actual experiment ever achieves complete sky coverage . in the case of cobe , pixels close to the galactic plane are contaminated , leaving only about two thirds of the sky usable .",
    "all other experiments to date have covered even smaller patches of sky .",
    "this fact requires us to completely change our approach .",
    "as much as we would like to estimate each @xmath34 and hence each @xmath37 individually , in the absence of complete sky coverage it is impossible to do so .",
    "there is in fact no estimator of a particular @xmath37 that is `` uncontaminated , '' _",
    "i.e. _ , that is independent of all of the other @xmath255 .    we may decide that it is important to estimate each @xmath37 individually , with the minimum possible contamination from other multipoles .",
    "tegmark ( 1996a ) has devised power - spectrum estimators with this property in mind and has applied them to both galaxy surveys ( tegmark 1995 ) and the four - year cobe data ( 1996b ) .",
    "for instance , suppose we have our hearts set on knowing the value of @xmath256 as well as possible .",
    "since the power spectrum is quadratic in @xmath30 , it is natural to choose a quadratic estimator , @xmath257 here @xmath203 is a data point and we want to choose the matrix elements @xmath258 and the bias correction @xmath259 in order to get as good an estimator as possible .",
    "tegmark ( 1996a ) proposes that we choose these quantities to make our estimator unbiased and to minimize the dependence of @xmath260 on all of the other @xmath37 s .",
    "he shows that it is impossible to completely remove contamination from other multipoles and that in general the `` spectral resolution '' @xmath261 of an experiment is approximately the reciprocal of the angular scale @xmath262 covered by the sky map . in particular , for an experiment like cobe , @xmath263 radian , and",
    "it turns out that it is possible to estimate a particular @xmath37 with significant contamination only from modes with @xmath264 ( tegmark 1996a , 1996c ) .",
    "we may , however , decide that it is nt so important to estimate each @xmath37 individually .",
    "often , a more fruitful approach is to parameterize the power spectrum @xmath37 with a small number @xmath31 of parameters , @xmath265 and use maximum - likelihood methods to estimate those parameters .",
    "this is in fact the usual approach in cmb data analysis .",
    "specific choices of the parameters @xmath266 include the following :    * we may assume a _",

    "normalization_. in this case , there is only one free parameter , which is conventionally taken to be the quadrupole amplitude @xmath267 . to emphasize the fact that it is a theoretical ensemble - average quantity . in particular , it is not the same as the local quadrupole @xmath268 .",
    "the cobe group generally denotes its estimators of @xmath269 by @xmath270 .",
    "] most degree - scale experiments are only powerful enough to determine a single number , the total power .",
    "one therefore frequently assumes a `` flat '' power spectrum @xmath271 and estimates the normalization , which in this context is often called @xmath272 . *",
    "both the normalization @xmath269 and the spectral index @xmath145 may be chosen as free parameters . for a large - angle experiment like cobe",
    ", the predicted power spectrum depends only weakly on many of the other parameters . *",
    "white & bunn ( 1995 ) have suggested a phenomenological parameterization of the power spectrum . at large angular scales ,",
    "many popular theoretical models are well approximated by power spectra that are quadratics in @xmath273 . to be specific",
    ", we may set @xmath274 and work with a three - parameter family @xmath275 of power spectra .",
    "* we may choose to divide the power spectrum over the range probed by a particular experiment into a small number of `` bands . ''",
    "we then estimate the power in each band , assuming that @xmath41 is constant in each band .",
    "this has been done for cobe ( hinshaw _ et al . _",
    "1996 ) and saskatoon ( netterfield _ et al . _",
    "1996 ) , although the latter uses a completely different method .",
    "no matter what parameterization we adopt , we need a way to compute the likelihood @xmath238 for a given power spectrum . as long as we assume gaussian statistics ,",
    "it is relatively easy to write down a formula for the likelihood , although as we shall see it can be cumbersome to compute it in practice .",
    "we begin by introducing some notation .",
    "each data point @xmath203 is as usual the sum of the signal @xmath276 and noise @xmath205 .",

    "the correspondence is @xmath280 , so that @xmath279 ranges from 1 to @xmath281 as @xmath278 take on all of their allowed values . then we can write equation ( [ eq : datadef ] ) more compactly as @xmath282 where @xmath283 is the data vector , @xmath284 is the noise vector , and the infinite - dimensional vector @xmath285 contains the spherical harmonic coefficients .",
    "the @xmath286-dimensional spherical harmonic matrix @xmath287 has elements @xmath288    the statistical properties of @xmath289 are determined by the properties of @xmath290 and @xmath291 .",

    "equation ( [ eq : gausslikely ] ) tells us how to compute the likelihood for any particular power spectrum @xmath37 , so all we need to do is hunt through our parameter space for the parameters that maximize the likelihood .",
    "in fact , for a typical degree - scale experiment with tens or at most hundreds of pixels , this is essentially what is done . for a large data set such as cobe , though",
    ", there are too many pixels for this to be convenient : each time we wish to compute a likelihood , we must invert the @xmath299 matrix @xmath297 . for cobe , therefore , we must implement some form of `` data compression '' to make the analysis tractable .",
    "( data compression will be even more essential for a future satellite experiment with orders of magnitude more pixels than cobe . )      before we discuss data compression , though , we need to discuss one more issue .",
    "the hypothetical experiment we have been discussing is still overly idealized in one important way .",
    "we have assumed that the signal measured by the experiment is the temperature anisotropy @xmath30 at a point . in reality , no experiment has perfect resolution , so the observed signal is actually the convolution of @xmath30 with some beam pattern or point - spread function .",
    "furthermore , many experiments chop their beams between two ( or more ) points on the sky , with the measured signal being a difference between these points .",
    "the effect of the beam pattern on our analysis is fairly simple .",
    "let @xmath300 represent the response of the instrument to a point an angular distance @xmath301 from the line of sight .",
    "( we assume that the beam pattern is azimuthally symmetric . )",

    ".    we can adapt all of the previous results of this section to take beam - smoothing into account by simply saying that our experiment is measuring the beam - smoothed power spectrum , @xmath311 instead of @xmath37 .",
    "we can account for the effect of beam - switching in a similar way .",
    "consider an experiment that chops between two points with spherical coordinates @xmath312 and @xmath313 .",
    "ignoring beam - smoothing , the observed signal @xmath314 is the difference in the anisotropy between these two points : @xmath315 the azimuthal dependence of @xmath149 is @xmath316 , so @xmath317 the net result is that @xmath34 is replaced by @xmath318 , so modes with low @xmath319 are suppressed .",
    "since @xmath127 ranges from @xmath320 to @xmath35 , this suppression affects primarily modes with low @xmath35 .",
    "are suppressed depends on the fact that we have oriented our coordinate system with the chop in the azimuthal direction .",
    "in contrast , the statement that , on average , modes with low @xmath35 are suppressed is independent of the orientation of the coordinate system . ]",
    "this suppression is conventionally quantified by computing a `` window function '' that represents the sensitivity of the experiment to different multipoles . to do this",
    ", we compute the mean - square signal , @xmath321 the window function @xmath322 is small for low @xmath35 , indicating that chopping has rendered this experiment insensitive to the largest angular scales .",
    "note that we have not included beam - smoothing in equation ( [ eq : chop ] ) .",
    "the correct window function , including beam - smoothing , is obtained by multiplying this result by @xmath323 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : chop ] ) gives the window function for the particularly simple case of a single - difference experiment .",
    "there are more complicated switching strategies , including sinusoidal chops and triple - beam experiments . for a more detailed discussion of window functions ,",

    "in the previous section , we discussed various issues of cmb data analysis from a general point of view .",
    "we will now apply what we have learned to a specific example , namely the cobe dmr data .",
    "we will not describe the cobe instrument in detail ; the interested reader is referred to george smoot s contribution to this volume , as well as to the papers reporting the four - year dmr data ( bennett _ et al . _  1996 ,",
    "et al . _",
    "1996 , hinshaw _ et al . _  1996 ,",

    "1996 ) and references therein .",
    "we will content ourselves with mentioning a few of the most relevant facts .",
    "the cobe dmr produced all - sky maps of the microwave radiation at three frequencies , 31 ghz , 53 ghz , and 90 ghz , with a beam size of @xmath324 ( fwhm ) .",
    "the maps consist of 6144 pixels , although only about 4000 of them are at high enough galactic latitude to be used for studying the cmb .",
    "although the dmr is a differencing instrument , the data have been used to produce sky maps of @xmath30 , so we do not need to worry about beam - switching in our analysis .",
    "we do , however , have to worry about the fact that the maps are insensitive to the monopole and dipole of the anisotropy .",
    "the noise in the cobe maps appears to be gaussian , and different pixels have noise that is approximately uncorrelated ( lineweaver _ et al . _",
    "therefore , as long as the cmb anisotropy obeys gaussian statistics , equation ( [ eq : gausslikely ] ) applies : @xmath325 where @xmath326 with @xmath327 .",
    "the matrix @xmath297 is @xmath328 , which is a size that can be inverted , with sufficient patience , on a workstation .",
    "tegmark & bunn ( 1995 ) have performed such a brute - force analysis on the two - year cobe dmr data for a two - parameter family of power spectra , with results shown in figure [ fig : brute ] . however , if we wish to explore a larger parameter space , we must find a more efficient way to compute likelihoods .",
    "all likelihood analyses of the cobe data , with the exception of the brute - force analysis mentioned above , have involved some form of data compression .",
    "that is , the pixel data @xmath289 has been mapped to some smaller - dimensional data vector , which has been used for computing likelihoods .",
    "we will focus on _ linear _ methods of data compression , in which the compressed data vector @xmath329 is linear in @xmath289 , @xmath330 for some @xmath331 matrix @xmath332 with @xmath333 .",
    "@xmath329 is a gaussian random vector , so we can use equation ( [ eq : gausslikely ] ) to compute the likelihood of @xmath329 in terms of the covariance matrix @xmath334 of course , the likelihood computed in this way will not be the same as the true likelihood computed from @xmath289 , but we can hope that , if we perform our data compression wisely , we will get a reasonable approximation to the true likelihood .    in effect , linear data compression is equivalent to expanding the sky map in a set of normal modes , namely the rows of @xmath332 .",
    "each element of the compressed data vector @xmath13 is approximately the integral of the sky map , multiplied by some function : heuristically , we can write @xmath335 if our pixels uniformly covered the whole sky , we would choose these mode functions to be the spherical harmonics by setting @xmath336",
    ". then @xmath337 would be an estimate of @xmath338 ( up to an overall normalization ) .",
    "in fact , we would be performing precisely the analysis described in section [ sec : noise ] .",
    "even though we do not actually have complete sky coverage , there is still nothing stopping us from choosing the rows of @xmath332 to be the spherical harmonics .",
    "this is in fact the technique described by grski ( 1994 ) , which has been applied to the dmr data by grski _",

    "compress the data from @xmath340 to @xmath341 numbers , with little loss of cosmological information .",
    "this is possible because the cosmic signal in the data drops off rapidly with increasing @xmath35 ( due to both the beam cutoff and the shape of the anisotropy power spectrum ) , while the noise has approximately equal power in all modes .",
    "the karhunen - love transform ( karhunen  1947 ) , which is also known as optimal subspace filtering or expansion in signal - to - noise eigenmodes , is another prescription for linear data compression .",
    "it was first introduced to cmb data analysis by bond ( 1994 , 1995 , 1996 ) , and has been used extensively on the cobe data ( bunn , scott , & white  1995 ; bunn 1995 ; white & bunn 1995 ; bunn & sugiyama 1996 ; bunn , liddle , & white 1996 ; bunn & white 1996 ) as well as in analyzing galaxy catalogues ( vogeley & szalay 1996 ) .",
    "let us consider a one - parameter family of power spectra @xmath342 , where the true value of @xmath343 is @xmath344 .",
    "we wish to choose our method of data compression ( _ i.e. _ , the matrix @xmath332 ) to enable us to estimate @xmath343 as well as possible .",
    "specifically , we choose @xmath332 to maximize our ability to reject incorrect values of @xmath343 .    on average , the likelihood function @xmath345 has a peak at the true value @xmath346 , so @xmath347 .",
    "the average rejection power is determined by the rate at which the likelihood declines when we move away from this peak .",
    "the figure of merit for describing rejection power is therefore @xmath348 the karhunen - love transform consists of choosing the compression matrix @xmath332 to maximize @xmath349 ( for a fixed value of @xmath162 , the dimension of the compressed data vector ) .    to solve this optimization problem , we write down the likelihood in terms of the reduced data vector @xmath329 , @xmath350",
    "then we compute @xmath349 , vary a matrix element @xmath258 , and set @xmath351 . after some algebra",
    ", we find that each row @xmath352 of @xmath332 must satisfy an eigenvalue equation , @xmath353 here @xmath354 is the covariance matrix @xmath297 corresponding to the correct parameter value @xmath346 , and @xmath355 the rejection power @xmath349 is simply the sum of the squares of the eigenvalues @xmath356 .",
    "this completes our prescription for choosing the matrix @xmath332 .",
    "we should choose the rows of @xmath332 to be the solutions of equation ( [ eq : eigen ] ) with the largest values of @xmath357 .",
    "furthermore , we know when it is safe to stop adding new rows : once all of the remaining eigenvalues @xmath356 are small , we will no longer significantly increase @xmath349 by adding more rows to @xmath332 .    to get an intuitive understanding of the karhunen - love transform ,",
    "consider the case where the parameter @xmath343 is the normalization of the power spectrum , so @xmath358 .",
    "then we can rewrite the eigenvalue equation ( [ eq : eigen ] ) as @xmath359 where @xmath360 , and @xmath361 and @xmath362 are the signal and noise contributions to @xmath297 .",
    "we can see from equation ( [ eq : eigen2 ] ) that @xmath352 is an eigenvector of @xmath363 .",
    "this is why bond ( 1994 , 1995 ) calls it an `` eigenmode of the signal - to - noise ratio . '' in effect , the karhunen - love transform tells us which directions in the @xmath193-dimensional pixel space are most sensitive to the cosmic signal , and which are dominated by noise .",
    "the reader , being an extraordinarily perceptive soul , is no doubt wondering at this point whether this whole procedure is worth the trouble .",
    "after all , our original goal was to avoid having to invert an @xmath299 matrix .",
    "now we find ourselves having to solve an @xmath193-dimensional eigenvalue problem , which is much harder than simply inverting a matrix .",
    "recall , however , that our objection to a brute - force likelihood analysis was that we did nt want to invert the large matrix @xmath297 _ repeatedly _ as we varied the power spectrum .",
    "the karhunen - love eigenvalue problem needs to be solved only once , with all future operations being performed on the @xmath162-dimensional compressed data vector .",
    "furthermore , it turns out that we can save ourselves a lot of work by solving equation ( [ eq : eigen ] ) in spherical harmonic space rather than real space ( bunn 1995 ) .",
    "once we choose some cutoff @xmath364 , the dimension of the eigenvalue problem is reduced from @xmath193 to @xmath365 .",
    "it turns out that none of the high signal - to - noise eigenmodes have significant power beyond @xmath339 or so , so we can safely choose @xmath364 to be 40 or 50 , resulting in a substantial saving in computational effort .",
    "the karhunen - love transform depends on a choice of power spectrum .",
    "ideally , we would like to use the true power spectrum , but of course we do nt know the true power spectrum .",
    "we must therefore choose a _ fiducial power spectrum _ more or less arbitrarily . in principle , this could lead to trouble",
    ": we might find that the choice of fiducial power spectrum had a significant effect on our final results .",
    "there are two ways to address this question : we can repeat the analysis with different fiducial power spectra , and we can perform monte carlo simulations to check that the likelihood analysis returns unbiased estimates of the parameters of interest .    in the case of the cobe data ,",
    "extensive tests have revealed that sensitivity to the fiducial power spectrum is not a problem ( bunn 1995 , bunn & white 1996 ) .",
    "for example , the maximum - likelihood normalization of an @xmath39 sachs - wolfe spectrum is @xmath366 using an @xmath39 fiducial power spectrum and @xmath367 using an @xmath368 power spectrum .",
    "the maximum - likelihood value of @xmath145 also does not change when we change the fiducial power spectrum .",
    "furthermore , monte carlo simulations show that our estimates of @xmath269 and @xmath145 are unbiased to an accuracy much better than the statistical uncertainty ( @xmath369 and @xmath370 respectively ) .",
    "see bunn & white ( 1996 ) for further details .",
    "since the cobe data do not contain useful monopole and dipole information , it is customary to remove a best - fit monopole and dipole from the data before performing any further analysis .",
    "unfortunately , since incomplete sky coverage destroys the orthogonality of the spherical harmonics , this procedure covertly removes part of the contribution of the higher multipoles .",
    "there are two ways to compensate for this .",
    "the first option is to treat the monopole and dipole coefficients ( @xmath371 and @xmath372 ) as `` nuisance parameters , '' _",
    "i.e. _ , quantities whose true values we neither know nor care about . , we should probably compute @xmath373 and treat @xmath269 as a nuisance parameter . at some other time , though , we may think @xmath269 is an interesting thing to know . ] in the context of bayesian analysis , the natural thing to do with nuisance parameters it to marginalize over them .",
    "marginalizing over a nuisance parameter @xmath374 means replacing the likelihood @xmath238 with the marginal likelihood @xmath375 here @xmath376 is a prior probability density for @xmath374 , which is usually taken to be constant . by marginalizing over the data , we are using a standard identity of probability theory , @xmath377 to remove all @xmath374-dependence from the likelihood .    from a frequentist point of view",
    ", the natural way to get rid of a nuisance parameter is to maximize with respect to it .",
    "that is , we replace @xmath238 with @xmath378 .",
    "that way , a particular model is ruled out only if it is ruled out for all possible values of @xmath374 .",
    "if we are performing some sort of data compression , then we have a second option for dealing with the monopole and dipole .",
    "we can simply impose a constraint on our compression matrix @xmath332 , requiring it to be insensitive to the unwanted multipoles .",
    "this is in effect the approach of grski ( 1994 ) : by orthogonalizing the spherical harmonics , he makes his compression matrix insensitive to the monopole and dipole .",
    "this approach turns out to be mathematically equivalent to marginalizing over the unwanted modes .",
    "people frequently remove the quadrupole information from the cobe data in the same way as the monopole and dipole , on the grounds that the quadrupole is particularly susceptible to galactic contamination .",
    "it has also been known since the earliest days of cobe analysis that the quadrupole is anomalously low ( compared to the prediction of a flat power spectrum normalized to the other multipoles ) . from a statistical point of view , this is a delicate situation : it is perfectly acceptable , and even wise , to throw away data if there is a reasonable fear of contamination , but throwing away data that is known _ a priori _ to be discordant with favored theories is a major statistical _",
    "faux pas_. on balance , it is probably better to leave the quadrupole information in in the interest of avoiding even the possibility of biased editing of the data",
    ".    there is another argument in favor of retaining the quadrupole .",
    "even if the quadrupole is contaminated , it still contains useful information , and so it may be unwise to throw it away entirely . since the quadrupole is a root - mean - square quantity , any contaminant would tend to bias the quadrupole up .",
    "in fact , if a particular theory is ruled out because it predicts too large a quadrupole , hypothesizing an additional quadrupolar contaminant can not save that theory : as long as the contaminant is statistically independent of the cosmic signal , the net result of hypothesizing a contaminant is necessarily to _ lower _ the likelihood of that theory .",
    "the main purpose of this section is to discuss data analysis techniques , not results ; however , we will briefly present some results based on a karhunen - love analysis of the four - year cobe dmr data .",
    "the reader is referred to bunn & white ( 1996 ) for a more detailed discussion .",
    "the data set used for this analysis consists of a weighted average of the 53 and 90 ghz maps from the four - year dmr data .",
    "the maps are averaged with weights inversely proportional to the noise variance , in order to minimize noise in the average map .",
    "( this is equivalent to performing a joint likelihood analysis of the individual maps . )",

    "( recall that this sum is proportional to the rejection power @xmath349 . )",

    "figure [ fig : bestfit ] shows the maximum - likelihood power spectrum , found by allowing each @xmath37 with @xmath379 to vary independently .",
    "the error bars shown in this figure are standard errors determined by approximating the likelihood near the peak as a gaussian .",
    "the standard errors are then the square roots of the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix of this gaussian .",
    "error bars determined in this way should be viewed with extreme caution .",
    "first , the likelihood is not very well approximated by a gaussian : on the contrary , it is strongly skew - positive at low @xmath35 .",
    "second , these standard errors contain no information about correlations between the errors .",
    "these correlations are largest for pairs of modes whose @xmath35-values differ by 2 .",
    "( coupling between modes with @xmath380 is weak because the data have approximate reflection symmetry . )",
    "the deceptively small error bar on the estimate of @xmath200 is largely due to the failure of the gaussian approximation for the likelihood , although the 15% anticorrelation between @xmath200 and @xmath381 also plays a role .",
    "finally , table [ table : sigma8 ] shows values of the small - scale fluctuation amplitude @xmath382 for various theoretical models .",
    "the observational constraint is approximately @xmath383 ( _ e.g. _ , viana & liddle 1996 ) .      until now , we have focused on attempts to estimate the angular power spectrum @xmath37 .",
    "while this is the most useful thing to do with a cmb data set , other complementary approaches can be interesting in certain contexts .",
    "for instance , we can assume that we know the angular power spectrum and try to determine the underlying cosmic signal from a noisy sky map .",
    "that is , we can attempt to _ filter _ a sky map , cleaning up the noise and leaving the signal .",
    "the wiener filter ( wiener 1949 ) is optimal linear filter for this purpose , in the sense of least squares . the recent use of wiener filtering in astrophysics is largely due to rybicki & press ( 1992 ) , and",

    "the wiener - filtered data is also the maximum - likelihood estimator of @xmath30 at each point .",
    "note that in regions of very high noise , where we have little information , the wiener filter returns values near zero , because this is the most likely _ a priori _ value of a zero - mean gaussian .",
    "figure [ fig : wiener ] shows a wiener - filtered cobe sky map . although the signal - to - noise ratio in the raw pixel maps is typically less than one per pixel , the largest - amplitude features in the filtered map are significant at the five sigma level per pixel .",
    "one of the main uses of the filtered maps is in making predictions for other experiments .",

    "however , it is important to remember that analysis of future data sets will present challenges that make the cobe analysis look easy . when sky maps contain a million pixels instead of a few thousand , data compression will be absolutely essential .",
    "it is already time to start thinking about this difficult problem .",
    "in addition , future experiments with higher resolution than cobe will be more susceptible to foreground contamination . in the case of cobe , it is believed that simply excising points too close to the galactic plane is sufficient to remove most of the foreground contamination ; for future high - sensitivity degree - scale experiments , more sophisticated methods will be necessary .",
    "we have seen that cdm - like theoretical models predict that vast amounts of information are encoded in the cmb anisotropy power spectrum .",
    "there is a very real hope that the cmb will give us accurate values for all sorts of cosmological parameters .",
    "but even if the information is there , we will have to do a lot of work to wrest it from the data .",
    "the first half of these lectures is based largely on the work of wayne hu and naoshi sugiyama .",
    "much of the later material is based on work i performed in collaboration with douglas scott , joseph silk , max tegmark , and martin white .",
    "i would like to thank all of these people for many helpful discussions .",
    "in addition , wayne , max , and martin made some of the figures .",
    "finally , i would like to thank the organizers of the meeting for their hard work and hospitality .",
