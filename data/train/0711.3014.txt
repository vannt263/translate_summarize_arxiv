    "the mergers that every galaxy - hosting dark matter halo experiences can trigger angular momentum transport in the interstellar medium of the merger remnant . if a substantial amount of gas is transported into the central kiloparsec of the remnant , the gas can fuel a starburst forming a central stellar system  a `` classical '' bulge ( i.e. , self - gravitating , baryon - dominated stellar system supported by random motions rather than rotation ) .",

    "although the precise characteristics of mergers that form classical bulges remain unknown , disk - dominated galaxies must have avoided major mergers during and after formation .",
    "just how large the mass ratio of the merging galactic halos must be in order to induce bulge formation is somewhat uncertain , however .",
    "mergers of similar - mass galaxies have been shown to trigger starbursts and result in elliptical galaxies , by gas dynamical and @xmath6-body simulations for galaxy halo masses @xmath7 , merging at relative velocities of the order of the virial velocity @xcite . in that case , a bulge forms from the momentum - exchange and compression of gas in merger shocks and the outward angular momentum transport induced by merger torques .",

    "efficient transport of angular momentum in perturbed gas disks requires an excitation of nonlinear waves by nonaxisymmetric potential distortions that can give rise to momentum - transporting shocks .",
    "the strength of merger shocks is characterized by the mach number @xmath14 , which is the ratio of the shock velocity @xmath15 to the sound speed of the warm neutral gas @xmath16 .",
    "merger - driven strong shocks are radiative , because the post - shock cooling time is much shorter than the dynamical and sound crossing times of the disk . in this limit",

    "we expect @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the relative velocity of the two galaxies , while in minor mergers @xmath20 , although the forcing of the gas can be strong where the gravitational torque is amplified locally by a resonance . in view of these considerations",
    ", we postulate that , besides the mass ratio @xmath21 , the efficiency of gas transport in mergers is controlled by a second parameter , the merger mach number @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the virial velocity of the larger merging halo , and @xmath24 is a dimensionless ratio of the orbital velocity @xmath19 of the two galaxies ( i.e. , merging dark matter halo centers ) at the small radii that are relevant to bulge formation ( @xmath25 ) to the virial velocity @xmath26 . , where @xmath27 is the mass inside a sphere with radius @xmath28 centered on the halo within which the mean density equals @xmath29 times the critical density of the universe .",
    "]    the relative velocity of gas disks could be smaller than the virial velocity , i.e. , @xmath30 , if the merger starts affecting the gas only when the distance between the halo centers has become much smaller than the scale radii @xmath31 in the ( * ? ? ?",

    "we emphasize , however , that in minor mergers , one must not attempt to identify @xmath14 directly with @xmath45 , because while @xmath46 in all cases of interest , the shock mach number , which reflects the velocity of secondary gas flows in a perturbed merging system , can well be close to or below unity , implying a regime in which angular momentum transport is inefficient . the true condition for bulge formation triggering could be @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is a threshold and @xmath49 is a power , e.g. , @xmath50 ( the `` linear hypothesis '' ) and @xmath51 ( the `` compression ratio hypothesis '' ) .",
    "an important distinct possibility is that in which bulge formation is driven _",
    "cumulatively _ , rather than induced in a single merger @xcite .",
    "the central density of gas in the disk of a late - type disk galaxy could increase gradually due to slow , continuous radial gas inflow .",
    "evidence for such inflow can be found in the `` central light excess '' ( above the exponential law ) in pure disk galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the inflow could be excited by perturbations associated with minor mergers . through their differential gravitational perturbations ,",
    "many consecutive minor mergers can induce a slow , secular drift in the angular momentum distribution of the disk fluid , which could lead to central accumulation without leaving any characteristic signatures of merger - driven evolution ( dynamically hot stellar components , etc . ) .",
    "the inflow could also be driven by nongravitational processes , such as the magnetorotational instability in the gas disk ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting increase of the central surface density brings the galaxy closer to the threshold for gravitational instability . the bulge or pseudobulge formation - triggering merger",
    "then must only nudge the galaxy over the threshold for , e.g. , nuclear bar formation , where the galaxy is already marginally unstable .    for systems which are gas - poor , collisionless mergers of stars can result in an elliptical galaxy or a classical bulge , if and only if the @xmath21 is sufficiently large ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this bulge formation can be characterized by merger ratio @xmath21 , but it is independent of @xmath52 because the gravitational dynamics without gas is scale free .",
    "however , there will still be a dependence on @xmath26 through the requirement that the galaxies _ prior _ to their merger were able to form long - lived ( i.e. low - mass ) stars ( see below ) .      in order for the merger of two halos to have produced a bulge ,",
    "the halos must have contained a substantial amount of gas , or else stars already formed from collapsed gas .",
    "the gas content of small - mass halos , however , was affected by the reheating of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) out of which the gas inside those halos collapsed , by cosmic reionization , a phenomenon known as jeans - mass filtering @xcite .",
    "the gas pressure of the reheated intergalactic medium competes with gravitational instability , in that case , to suppress structure formation in those baryons which would otherwise have formed galaxies with virial velocity below some threshold .",
    "the jeans length in the igm for a gas photoheated to @xmath53 corresponds to a halo mass after collapse and virialization for which the circular velocity is @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the actual threshold virial velocity is uncertain , because one must account for the time - dependent growth of fluctuations in an evolving background and because the formation of dark matter halos affects the baryons in a nonlinear way .",
    "estimates of the value of the velocity threshold which results range from about @xmath55 to @xmath56 @xcite . whatever the precise value should be , this would impose a lower limit to the critical virial velocity of merging halos capable of producing a bulge , as described above , i.e. , @xmath57 .",
    "since the virial velocity threshold which results from jeans - mass filtering depends primarily on the temperature , other sources of igm heating could have a similar effect .",
    "the supernova explosions associated with massive star formation , for example , could also heat the intergalactic gas .",
    "such feedback could also have unbound the interstellar gas from the galaxies which formed these stars , if the galaxy virial velocities were small enough .      to explore the sensitivity of the fractional abundance of disk - dominated galaxies produced during structure formation to the critical values of @xmath21 and @xmath26 , and thus to place constraints on the values of these two parameters that are compatible with the observed statistics",
    ", we generate merger histories of low - mass , disk - galaxy hosting halos and study disk survival in this population of halos .",
    "we utilize those merger histories to calculate the abundance of disk - dominated galaxies as a function of @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "we compare the resulting abundances with the incidence of late - type galaxies in the _ tully galaxy catalog _",
    "(   [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "the merger histories are generated from the nonlinear evolution of the initial , linearly perturbed cosmological density field using the publicly - available lagrangian perturbation code pinocchio @xcite .",
    "the code generates a gaussian - random field on a cubic mesh , distributes particles on the mesh , and determines the collapse time of each particle using an ellipsoidal collapse criterion .",
    "the `` collapsed '' particles are moved by lagrangian perturbation theory and related to virialized objects , which are the dark matter halos , by a linking criterion .",
    "we employed @xmath60 particles with cosmological parameters @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , in a cubical box with @xmath65 comoving mpc on a side .",
    "the mass of an individual particle was @xmath66 , and halos with more than @xmath67 particles were selected for inclusion in the merger tree . for a given redshift",
    ", pinocchio provides a list of all of the halos with mass @xmath68 which formed inside the comoving box at this or any _ earlier _ redshift , and a complete list of their merger events .",
    "each merger event is characterized by the merger redshift and the masses of the halos participating in the merger .",
    "we compute the fraction of halos containing disk - dominated galaxies as a function of the threshold for spheroid formation that is parametrized by the critical mass ratio @xmath21 and critical virial velocity @xmath23 of the larger halo at the time of each merger .",
    "specifically , we assume that a merger with @xmath69 will create a central stellar spheroid if the halo has a virial velocity @xmath70 .",
    "we follow the most massive progenitor branch of the merger history of each halo and identify the resulting @xmath71 halo as containing a disk - dominated galaxy if no spheroid has yet formed in the halo based on the defined criterion .",
    "there are rare cases in which a progenitor mass is so small at high redshift that bulge - forming mergers are not resolved by our numerical results .",
    "we have estimated the number of such cases and confirmed that it is negligible .",
    "for @xmath72 , the fraction of current halos in the mass range we will describe below , in which bulge - forming mergers occur with a halo containing less than @xmath65 particles is less than @xmath73 . for @xmath74 ,",
    "the fraction increases to @xmath75 , but the total mass of the merger remnant is small for those mergers with @xmath76 .",
    "if the smaller halo contains 50 particles , the merger remnant with @xmath76 has at most 150 particles , which is ten times smaller than @xmath77 , the minimum mass of interest for our comparisons with present - day galaxies .",
    "we consider halos with present masses in the range @xmath78 , where @xmath79 ( corresponding to @xmath80 ) and @xmath81 ( corresponding to @xmath82 ) ; the resulting galaxy statistics are compared with the observed galaxy statistics in the same approximate mass range . [ since the halo mass and the maximum circular velocity of the galaxy disk are not known for most of the galaxies in each observed sample , we use the tully - fisher relation to estimate halo masses for the observed galaxies . ] the present total number density of halos in the above range is @xmath83 .",
    "disk - dominated galaxy abundances thus calculated will not be strongly dependent on the specific choice of @xmath84 because halos with masses @xmath85 dominate the number density of halos in the universe today",
    ". however , the abundances will be sensitive to @xmath77 . in ",
    "[ sec : results ] , we explore the sensitivity to the choice of @xmath77 .",
    "an approach more accurate than the one employed here would dispense with @xmath77 and would consider halos of all masses and then match the fractional disk and irregular galaxy abundances as a function of halo mass .",
    "we ignore the finite duration of the merger , which is the time elapsed between the halo contact and the final bulge formation . indeed",
    ", the delay accounting for a finite merger duration will affect only the low - redshift , disk - destroying mergers which are in the minority ( @xmath86 , fig .",
    "[ fig : redshift ] ) .",
    "the dynamical friction time scale was recently calibrated in @xmath6-body simulations @xcite , @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the circularity parameter . setting @xmath89 and @xmath90 ,",
    "this simplifies to @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the hubble time at halo merger . if a pair of halos with mass ratio @xmath93 merges before @xmath94 , the galaxies in the halos merge by @xmath71 . in the halo mass range corresponding to disk - dominated galaxy hosts ,",
    "the present fraction of mergers in progress is only @xmath95 for mass ratios @xmath96 and @xmath97 for @xmath93 .",
    "figure  [ fig : diskfraction ] shows the fraction of galaxies without classical bulge as a function of the bulge formation criterion @xmath98 , which is the result of the model described in   [ sec : trees ] . in order to compare these theoretical contours with the observed abundance of disk - dominated galaxies , we select 2281 galaxies in the nearby universe from the _ tully galaxy catalog _ that have blue magnitudes in the range @xmath99 and are located at distances @xmath100 at which the catalog is reasonably complete .",
    "this luminosity range is chosen to render the number density of galaxies equal to the density @xmath101 of halos that we synthesize ( see   [ sec : trees ] ) . the corresponding circular velocity range calculated from the tully - fisher relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is @xmath102 .",
    "this range is consistent with the range of virial velocities in our theoretical halo sample , which is a self - consistency check of our association of galaxies with dark matter halos in our numerical halo catalog for @xmath0cdm .",
    "the assumption that the tully - fisher relation can be used to relate the luminosities of galaxies in the tully catalog to their halo virial velocities ( and , hence , to their masses , @xmath27 ) works best for the spiral galaxies but is less certain for the elliptical and s0 galaxies . the tully - fisher relation for s0 galaxies",
    "is shifted to lower luminosity by about @xmath103 for each @xmath104 , and the scatter is larger compared to spirals @xcite .",
    "this estimate is uncertain because the tully - fisher relation or virial mass - to - light ratio is unknown for s0s at small mass near @xmath105 .",
    "the virial mass - to - light ratio for elliptical galaxies could be a factor of 10 larger relative to spirals in the @xmath106-band @xcite .",
    "if we shift the luminosity range of the subsample that corresponds to @xmath107 by @xmath108 mag for ellipticals and @xmath109 mag for s0s , respectively , then all the ellipticals will be removed ( i.e. , @xmath110 ) and the number of s0s will increase by @xmath3 , but the sum of e and s0 will only decrease from 25% to 20% , and the sc contour move from 34% to 36% .",
    "hence , uncertainties regarding the virial velocities of the ellipticals and s0s in the sample do not significantly affect our determination of the disk - dominated portion .",
    "figure [ fig : tully ] is the same as figure [ fig : diskfraction ] ; it shows the fraction of disk - dominated galaxies for various bulge formation criteria .",
    "each pair of morphological type and fraction printed on the contour indicates that that morphological type and later types occupy the corresponding fraction in the subsample of the _ tully _ catalog . if we choose to assume that a particular morphological type ( e.g. , sd , sc , or sb ) and all later morphological types are disk - dominated galaxies , while the earlier morphological types are galaxies with classical bulges , then the fraction of disk - dominated galaxies in the subsample is explained by the parameters @xmath98 along the contour labeled by the chosen transitional morphological type .",
    "the classification by morphological type does not precisely separate galaxies that have classical bulges from those do not ; nevertheless we assume that sc and later type galaxies are either bulgeless or have pseudobulges , while sbc and earlier types contain classical bulges . assuming this correspondence , the contour `` sc '' in the figure shows the parameter space locus yielding the abundance of galaxies without classical bulges .",
    "while the criterion for the survival in mergers of a given morphological type must lie on the appropriate contour , from the statistics alone it can not be determined which specific value of @xmath111 along the contour is the true physical criterion for bulge formation .",
    "for example , the observed abundance of disk - dominated galaxies is consistent with the hypothesis that mergers with @xmath112 in halos with @xmath113 create classical bulges , while mergers that do not satisfy these criteria do not .",
    "this hypothesis is not unique ; a somewhat larger @xmath58 and somewhat smaller @xmath114 , and vice versa , would be equally plausible on the basis of the statistics alone . were the critical velocity for bulge formation above @xmath115 , however , then the relative abundance of disk - dominated galaxies would be greater than observed for all mass ratios @xmath21 . in that case",
    ", there would be too few galaxies with bulges relative to their observed abundance . a similar upper limit to @xmath59 results from the fact that classical bulges are unlikely to form from mergers that are too minor .",
    "if @xmath116 , mergers only produce enough disk - dominated galaxies if @xmath117 , which may be implausibly small . on the other hand , the critical virial velocity can not be much less than the minimum value imposed by jeans - mass filtering discussed in  [ sec : jeans - mass ] .",
    "this means that @xmath114 can not be much _ less _ than @xmath118 , either . to identify the true , unique criterion for bulge formation",
    ", one must resort to physical insight to exclude implausible , extreme criteria that are still allowed by the statistics .",
    "if we assume that @xmath58 lies between @xmath119 and @xmath120 , then the critical merger mach number @xmath121 lies between @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "when the two halo centers have approached to within kiloparsecs of each other , the true mach number of the gravitational perturbation will be reduced by the value of @xmath124 .",
    "therefore , the question of the physical plausibility of the criterion can be rephrased : in view of the gravitational hydrodynamics of the gas disks in merging galaxies , is it physically plausible that a merger with @xmath125 and @xmath126 does not trigger bulge formation , but a merger with a larger @xmath127 does lead to central gas inflow and bulge formation ? for the ad hoc choice @xmath50 and assuming @xmath124 , this yields a criterion @xmath128 .",
    "the @xcite sample of edge - on disk galaxies gives a similar disk - dominated galaxy fraction .",
    "if we assume the same additional fraction of early - type galaxies as in the tully subsample , the fraction of sd is @xmath129 and the fraction of sc or later is @xmath130 .    to test the dependence on mass cutoff @xmath77 , we vary this parameter from the fiducial cutoff at @xmath131 to a lower cutoff at @xmath132 .",
    "the number density of halos increases by @xmath133 to @xmath134 . to compensate for the change in the number density of galaxies , we move the lower luminosity cutoff for selection from the _ tully _ sample to @xmath135 .",
    "the observed fraction of disk - dominated galaxies ( sc or later morphological type ) remains unchanged at @xmath136 , but the contours representing the bulge formation criterion move by about @xmath137 toward lower critical virial velocities .",
    "this is because mergers with a fixed mass ratio @xmath21 tend to occur at smaller @xmath138 in smaller halos .",
    "the criterion , e.g. , with @xmath139 on the sc contour in figure [ fig : tully ] shifts only a small amount , to @xmath140 , as the mass cutoff is lowered to @xmath132 .",
    "any lower cutoffs than this are not appropriate , because at luminosities @xmath141 , disk galaxies give way to irregulars as the most common galaxy type ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the distribution is insensitive to the choices of @xmath58 and @xmath114 , as long as the two parameters remain on the same contour in figure [ fig : tully ] .",
    "this shows that bulge - forming mergers generally took place long after reionization was completed ( i.e. , @xmath144 ) .",
    "moreover , the typical collapse epoch for these merging halos was at @xmath145 @xcite , so their star formation was also post - reionization .",
