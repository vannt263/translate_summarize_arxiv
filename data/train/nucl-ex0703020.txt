    "most double beta decay investigations have concentrated on the @xmath10 decay ( see recent reviews @xcite ) .",
    "much less attention has been given to the investigation of @xmath11 , @xmath4ec and ecec processes . here",
    "ec denotes the electron capture process .",
    "although these alternate processes have been studied from time to time in the past ( see review [ 4 ] and compilation of existing data before april 2001 in @xcite ) the field should see further exploration .",
    "there are 34 candidates for these processes .",
    "only 6 nuclei can undergo all the above mentioned processes and 16 nuclei can undergo @xmath4ec and ecec while 12 can undergo only ecec .",
    "detection of the neutrinoless mode in the above processes enable one to determine the effective majorana neutrino mass @xmath12 , parameters of right - handed current admixture in electroweak interaction ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) , etc .",
    "detection of the two - neutrino mode in the above processes lets one determine the magnitude of the nuclear matrix elements involved , which is very important in view of the theoretical calculations for both the @xmath15 and the @xmath9 modes of double beta decay .",
    "interestingly , it was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that if the @xmath16 decay is detected , then the experimental limits on the @xmath17 half - lives can be used to obtain information about the relative importance of the majorana neutrino mass and right - handed current admixtures in electroweak interactions .",
    "the @xmath11 and @xmath4ec processes are less favorable due to smaller kinetic energy available for the emitted particles and coulomb barrier for the positrons . however , an attractive feature of these processes from the experimental point of view is the possibility of detecting either the coincidence signals from four ( two ) annihilation @xmath18-rays and two ( one ) positrons , or the annihilation @xmath18-rays .",
    "it is difficult to investigate the ecec process because one only detects the low energy x - rays .",
    "it is interesting to search for transitions to the excited states of daughter nuclei , which are easier to detect given the cascade of higher energy gammas @xcite .",
    "one can foresee that with improvement in the experimental techniques and increasing the mass of the detectors , the search for @xmath11 , @xmath4ec and ecec processes will be considerably extended .    during the last few years ,",
    "interest in the @xmath11 , @xmath4ec and ecec processes has greatly increased .",
    "for the first time a positive result was obtained in a geochemical experiment with @xmath19ba , where the ecec@xmath20 process was detected with a half - life of @xmath21 y @xcite .",
    "recently new limits on the ecec(@xmath15 ) process in promising candidate isotopes ( @xmath22kr and @xmath23cd ) were established ( @xmath24 y and @xmath25 y , respectively @xcite ) . also , for the first time limits on the double beta decay processes ( @xmath4ec and ecec ) in @xmath26se",
    "have been obtained @xcite .",
    "attention here was paid to the ecec(@xmath9 ) transition to the @xmath27 excited state of @xmath26ge ( 1204.2 kev ) . in this decay",
    "there is a possible enhancement of the decay rate by several order of magnitude , because the ecec(@xmath9 ) process is nearly degenerate with an excited state in the daughter nuclide . under resonant conditions such ecec(@xmath9 )",
    "processes can have the same sensitivity to neutrino mass as @xmath16 decay @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite there are limits on the ecec(@xmath15 ) process in @xmath28ce and @xmath29ce at the level @xmath30 10@xmath31 y. different @xmath11 , @xmath4ec and ecec processes in @xmath23cd , @xmath32cd and @xmath33w have been investigated with a sensitivity of @xmath30 10@xmath34 - 10@xmath35 y @xcite . very recently",
    "@xmath11 , @xmath4ec and ecec processes in @xmath0te , @xmath23cd , @xmath32cd and @xmath36zn were investigated in the framework of cobra test measurements which had a sensitivity on the level of @xmath30 10@xmath37 - 10@xmath34 y @xcite . among the recent papers",
    "are a few new theoretical papers with half - life estimations @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the @xmath11 , @xmath4ec and ecec processes have not been investigated very well , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "one can imagine some unexpected results here , which is why any improvements in experimental sensitivity for such transitions has merit .",
    "in this article the results of an experimental investigation of the @xmath4ec and ecec processes in @xmath0te ( transitions to the ground and excited states of @xmath0sn ) are presented .",
    "the decay scheme for the triplet @xmath0sn-@xmath0sb-@xmath0te is shown in fig .",
    "the q value of the transition is @xmath38 kev @xcite and natural abundance of @xmath0te is 0.089% .",
    "the following processes are possible :    @xmath39    @xmath40    @xmath41    @xmath42    where e@xmath43 is an atomic electron and x represents an x - rays or auger electrons .    in the case of ecec process",
    "there is a possible transition to the 2@xmath7 excited state ( 1171.26 kev ) . reported here",
    "is the search for the @xmath4ec and ecec transitions using a germanium detector to look for @xmath18-ray lines corresponding to the various decay schemes .",
    "the experiment was performed in the modane underground laboratory at a depth of 4800 m w.e .. the natural tellurium oxide powder sample was measured using a 400 @xmath1 low - background hpge detector .    the ge spectrometer is composed of a coaxial , p - type crystal . for the cryostat , the main parts , i.e. , the endcap and the crystal holding are made of a very pure al - si alloy .",
    "the cryostat had a j - type geometry to shield the crystal from radioactive impurities in the dewar and the preamplifier .",
    "the passive shielding consists of 4 cm of roman lead and 10 cm of ofhc copper inside 15 cm of ordinary lead . to remove any effect of the @xmath44rn gas , one of the main sources of the background",
    ", a special effort is made to minimize the free space near the detector .",
    "in addition , the passive shielding is enclosed in an aluminum box flushed with high purity nitrogen .",
    "the electronics consisted of spectrometric amplifier and an 8192 channel adc . the energy calibration was adjusted to cover the energy range from 50 kev to 3.5 mev , and the resolution was 2.0 kev for the 1332-kev line of @xmath45co .",
    "the electronics were stable during the experiment due to the constant conditions in the laboratory ( temperature of @xmath46 c , hygrometric degree of @xmath47% )",
    ". a daily check on the apparatus assured that the counting rate was statistically constant .",
    "the sample of natural teo@xmath2 powder was placed in a delrin marinelli box surrounding the hpge detector .",
    "the mass of the powder was 1004.2 g , 0.72 g of which was @xmath0te .",
    "thus @xmath48 nuclei of @xmath0te were under investigation .",
    "the duration of the measurement was 475.4 hours .",
    "the search for different @xmath4ec and ecec processes in @xmath0te looked for @xmath18-ray lines corresponding to these processes .",
    "introduced here is the notation @xmath49 which is the effective @xmath50-value defined as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the difference of the parent and daughter atomic masses and @xmath53 is an electron binding energy in a daughter nuclide . for @xmath0sn @xmath54",
    "is equal to 29.2 kev for the k shell and 4.46 kev , 4.15 kev and 3.93 kev for the l shell ( 2s , 2p@xmath55 and 2p@xmath56 levels ) . in the case of the l shell",
    "the resolution of the detector prohibits separation of the lines so we center the study on the 4.15 kev line .",
    "the ecec@xmath57 transition to the ground state of the daughter nuclei was considered for three different electron capture cases :    \\1 ) two electrons are captured from the the l shell . in this case",
    ", @xmath49 is equal to @xmath58 kev and the transition is accompanied by a bremsstrahlung @xmath18-quantum with an energy @xmath30 1691.8 kev .",

    "so in this case the more probable outcome is the irradiation of @xmath61 pair @xcite which gives two annihilation @xmath18-quanta with energy 511 kev .",
    "the ecec@xmath5 transition , to the 2@xmath7 excited state , is accompanied with @xmath18-quanta with an energy of 1171.26 kev .",
    "the @xmath4ec@xmath5 transition to the ground state is accompanied by two annihilation @xmath18-quanta with energy 511 kev .",
    "gamma - ray spectra of selected energy ranges are shown in fig .",

    "these spectra correspond to regions of interest for the different decay modes of @xmath0te .",
    "the spectra are presented with the background from measurements without the teo@xmath2 powder and corrected for the measuring time of the experiment . in these spectra",
    "all visible peaks in the experimental and background spectra are within one sigma error , so there are no extra events that are statistically significant at the @xmath62 level .",
    "the bayesian approach @xcite was used to estimate limits on transitions of @xmath0te to the ground and excited states of @xmath0sn . to construct the likelihood function every bin of the spectrum",
    "is supposed to have a poisson distribution with its mean @xmath63 and the number of events equal to the content of this @xmath64th bin .",
    "the mean @xmath63 can be written in general form as    @xmath65    the first term in ( 5 ) describes the contribution of the investigated process that may have a few @xmath18-lines contributing appreciably to the @xmath64th bin ; the parameter @xmath66 is the number of decays , @xmath67 is the detection efficiency of the @xmath68th @xmath18-line of this transition and @xmath69 is the contribution of @xmath68th line to the @xmath64th bin . for low - background measurements a @xmath18-line may be taken to have a gaussian shape .",
    "the second term gives contributions of background @xmath18-lines ; here @xmath70 is the area of the @xmath71th @xmath18-line and @xmath72 is its contribution to the @xmath64th bin .",
    "the third term represents the so - called `` continuous background '' @xmath73 which has been selected as a straight - line fit after rejecting all peaks in the region of interest .",
    "we have selected this region as the peak investigated @xmath74 30 standard deviations ( @xmath75 20 kev ) .",
    "the likelihood function is the product of probabilities for selected bins .",
    "normalizing this to 1 over parameter @xmath66 , it becomes the probability density function for @xmath66 , which is used to calculate limits for @xmath66 . to take into account errors of @xmath18-line shape parameters , peak areas , and other factors",
    ", one should multiply the likelihood function by the error probability distributions for those values and integrate , to provide the average probability density function for @xmath66 .    in the case of ecec@xmath57 transition to the ground state of @xmath0sn",
    "there is a large uncertainty in the energy of the bremsstrahlung @xmath18-quantum because of poor accuracy for @xmath52 ( @xmath76 kev ) .",
    "thus the position of the peak was varied in the region of the uncertainty and the most conservative value of the limit for the half - life was selected .",
    "the photon detection efficiency for each investigated process has been computed with the cern monte carlo code geant 3.21 .",
    "special calibration measurements with radioactive sources and powders containing well - known @xmath77ra activities confirmed that the accuracy of these efficiencies is about 10% .",

    "the experimental limits are quite interesting as they exclude some unexpected processes .",
    "our approach is not sensitive to the ecec@xmath20 capture to the ground state because x - rays are absorbed in the sample and can not reach the sensitive volume of the hpge detector .",
