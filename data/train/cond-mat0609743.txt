    "discovery@xcite of the fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) effect in a half - filled first excited landau level ( ll@xmath1 ) demonstrated the possibility for incompressible quantum liquid ( iql ) states outside of the `` standard '' hierarchy @xcite described below .",
    "laughlin states@xcite occur at the fractional ll fillings @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is electron concentration , @xmath4 is the magnetic length , and @xmath5 is an integer ) .",
    "the simple form of laughlin many - body wavefunctions suggested that their low energy could be understood in terms of the avoidance of pair states with the smallest relative pair angular momentum ( and largest repulsion).@xcite the quasiparticles ( qps ) of the laughlin states can ( under some conditions@xcite ) form `` daughter '' iql states with their own qps , giving rise to an entire iql hierarchy .",
    "@xcite the most stable iql states , occurring at @xmath6 ( @xmath7 being another integer ) , appear naturally in jain s composite fermion ( cf ) model@xcite involving the concepts of flux attachment and an effective magnetic field .",
    "all laughlin and jain states are characterized by odd - denominator filling fractions @xmath8 and fractional qp charge @xmath9 .    for the even - denominator iql state observed at @xmath10 , moore and read ( mr ) proposed@xcite a different , paired wavefunction , and predicted that its qps obeyed nonabelian statistics .",
    "the mr state has been studied in great detail@xcite and interpreted by two complementary@xcite pictures : as a laughlin state of tightly bound electron pairs@xcite or a superfluid of weakly bound cf pairs.@xcite    the first numerical calculations for interacting electrons in a partially filled ll@xmath1 were carried out by morf.@xcite they seemed to confirm that a half - filled ll@xmath1 has a spin - polarized incompressible ground state accurately described by the mr wavefunction . however , the subsequent experiments revealed minute excitation gaps @xmath11  k in the real @xmath10 states , up to @xmath12 smaller than predicted from numerics .",
    "the fact that only a small part of this discrepancy could be attributed to the finite width of the quasi-2d electron layer or to the weak disorder posed a challenge for the theoretical models .",
    "it also raised a fundamental question of whether the actual , experimentally realized @xmath10 states are indeed adequately described by the mr wavefunction .",
    "it has become very important in the context of topological quantum computation , whose recent proposals @xcite take advantage of the nonabelian qp statistics .",
    "this fundamental question is the main subject of our present paper .",
    "we directly include ll mixing in exact diagonalization by adding states containing a single cyclotron excitation to the hilbert space of a partially filled spin - polarized ll .",
    "this can be regarded as a first - order approximation in the coulomb - to - cyclotron energy ratio @xmath13 .",
    "we apply this procedure to the @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 states and evaluate the excitation energy gaps @xmath17 and ( in the last case ) the overlap @xmath18 with the mr wavefunction . at @xmath19 ( relevant for the experiments at @xmath10 ) , where our first - order results are only qualitative",
    ", we find a strong reduction in both @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "unfortunately , the calculations including excitations to higher order in @xmath13 are beyond our capabilities .",
    "our conclusion concerning the gap reduction gives qualitative support to the work of morf and dambrumenil,@xcite who however included ll mixing in a different way,@xcite using a screened interaction that is strictly valid only for @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , our prediction of strong deviation from the mr wavefunction supports the recent proposals@xcite for new experiments aimed at determining directly the qp statistics at @xmath10 ( rather than merely at determining the incompressibility ) .",
    "we use haldane s spherical geometry,@xcite convenient for the exact study of liquid states with short - range correlations . on a sphere of radius @xmath21 ,",
    "the normal magnetic field @xmath22 is produced by a dirac monopole of strength @xmath23 , defined here in the units of flux quantum @xmath24 . using a magnetic length @xmath25 ,",
    "this can be rewritten as @xmath26 .",
    "the series of lls labeled by @xmath27 , 1 , 2 ,   are represented by shells of angular momentum @xmath28 and degeneracy @xmath29 .",
    "the cyclotron energy is @xmath30 ( counted from the lowest ll ) , where @xmath31 is the effective mass . the orbitals @xmath32 are called monopole harmonics .    the @xmath33-electron hamiltonian matrix is calculated in the configuration - interaction basis @xmath34 . here",
    ", the composite indices @xmath35 $ ] also include spin , and the expressions for two - body coulomb matrix elements ( also in layers of finite widths @xmath36 ) can be found for example in ref .  .",
    "at a given ll filling ( defined by @xmath33 and @xmath37 , the basis states can be classified by @xmath38 , i.e. , the total cyclotron energy measured from the lowest possible value @xmath39 allowed by the pauli exclusion principle ( e.g. , @xmath40 at @xmath41 , or @xmath42 at @xmath43 ) .",
    "alternatively , the total number of cyclotron excitations @xmath44 can be defined .     as a function of angular momentum @xmath45 ) of @xmath46 electrons in a ll shell of angular momentum @xmath47",
    ", corresponding to an isolated , half - filled first excited ll .",

    "this reduces the @xmath33-particle problem to @xmath50 electrons confined to an isolated ll@xmath1 . a typical numerical spectrum is shown in fig .  [ fig1](a ) .",
    "the non - degenerate ground states with a gap generally appear in finite - size systems with even values of @xmath48 ( they are known to be paired@xcite ) at @xmath51 or ( equivalent via the @xmath52 particle - hole conjugation ) at @xmath53 , both extrapolating to @xmath54 for large @xmath48 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , the excitation gap @xmath17 rather weakly depends on @xmath48 , allowing one to estimate the value @xmath55 for an infinite ( planar ) system.@xcite    unfortunately , this value is not confirmed by the experiments .",
    "the gaps measured from the thermal activation of longitudinal conductance range from 0.001 to @xmath56 , depending on the electron mobility,@xcite with extrapolation to a disorder - free system not exceeding @xmath57 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) for @xmath58 ( i.e. , @xmath59  nm at @xmath60  t ) , this discrepancy can not be explained by a finite width of the electron layer .",
    "an obvious advantage of the @xmath49 approximation is that calculations can be done for sufficiently large values of @xmath33 to eliminate finite - size errors .",
    "it could be trivially justified by a small ratio of coulomb and cyclotron energies , @xmath61 ( with the bohr radius @xmath62 ) .",
    "however , @xmath63 at the fields @xmath64  t typically used in fqh experiments at @xmath10 .",

    "( c ) reduction of the excitation gap of different quantum hall states due to ll mixing , plotted as a function of the cyclotron - to - coulomb energy ratio @xmath66 . @xmath17 and @xmath67 are gaps calculated for @xmath68 and @xmath69 , 21 , and 17 ( for @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath16 ) .",

    "this can be regarded as a kind of first - order perturbation scheme in @xmath13 .",
    "however , note that such coupling of the entire @xmath49 and @xmath78 subspaces is more than a first - order perturbation on the specific @xmath49 eigenstates . the basis is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) and ( b ) . at @xmath10 ,",
    "the underlying , filled lowest ll gives rise to more types of excitations than at @xmath65 .",
    "generally , the inter - ll excitations can be decomposed into addition of an electron or a hole to a specific ll in the presence of a correlated state of the initial @xmath48 electrons .",
    "there are two distinct cases , depending on the target ll : ( i ) addition to ( or removal from ) the ll occupied by the incompressible liquid .",
    "this causes creation of several fractionally charged qps . at @xmath14 or @xmath15",
    "they are well known laughlin or jain qps , with a simple and intuitive picture in the cf model .",
    "however , the nature and dynamics of the qps at @xmath10 are not nearly as well understood .",
    "( ii ) addition to ( or removal from ) a different ll .",
    "this makes the added / removed electron distinguishable from the correlated electrons .",
    "this problem resembles coupling of a laughlin liquid to a ( positive ) valence hole@xcite or a ( negative ) trion.@xcite however , coupling of the @xmath10 state to a foreign charge is far less understood .    since all three types of @xmath78 excitations must be included in the calculation on the same footing , even this limited account of ll mixing boosts the space dimension from @xmath79 to @xmath80 for @xmath68 at @xmath81 .",
    "this precludes similar calculations for larger systems or further inclusion of the @xmath82 excitations . on one hand , this makes the present results somewhat susceptible to finite - size errors ( although fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) may suggest that @xmath68 , i.e. , four pairs , is already a representative system ) and accurate only up to the first - order perturbation in @xmath13 . on the other hand",
    ", a much larger number of @xmath78 excitations at @xmath83 than at @xmath65 suggests that the effects of ll mixing should be more important at @xmath10 than in laughlin or jain liquids of the lowest ll .",
    "we focus on two features of the @xmath10 state : the excitation gap and the overlap with the mr wavefunction .",
    "the results of calculations of the gap @xmath17 for @xmath68 and @xmath84 in a 2d layer of zero width are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) .",
    "as argued above and anticipated from experiments , the gap reduction @xmath85 ( where @xmath67 is the result for @xmath49 ) is noticeably greater at @xmath10 than at both @xmath14 or @xmath15 . on the other hand",
    ", the fact that the gap at @xmath14 is reduced more than at @xmath70 can be related to the smaller qp charge in the latter case ( @xmath86 versus @xmath87 ) .",
    "since the low - energy response of a liquid involves formation and interaction of the qps , the harsh @xmath88 criterion for the accuracy of the isolated - ll approximation may be relaxed to @xmath89 .",
    "here , @xmath90 involves the coulomb energy scale of the qps . indeed , when the gaps in the weak - perturbation regime are plotted as a function of @xmath75 as in fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) , the data for @xmath14 and @xmath15 falls close to the same line , @xmath91 .",
    "taking @xmath92 for the @xmath10 state results in a much ( about @xmath93 ) steeper curve .",
    "this indicates that the response of the @xmath10 state to the perturbation associated with the ll mixing at a finite @xmath13 is ( due to a richer inter - ll excitation spectrum ) relatively stronger than the response of laughlin or jain states in the lowest ll .",
    "furthermore , if the experiments on all three electron liquids were to be carried out at similar concentrations ( corresponding to a maximum mobility ) , the difference between them will be additionally magnified by a difference in @xmath13 corresponding to different @xmath8 .",
    "for example , for @xmath72  @xmath73 we obtained gap reduction of 8.5% , 2.5% , and 35% at @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , respectively .    in the above discussion",
    "we have established the following .",
    "( i ) realistic estimates of the excitation gap at @xmath10 must include the ll mixing , whose effect at this filling is much stronger than for laughlin or jain states in the lowest ll .",
    "( ii ) the gap reduction caused by ll mixing is already significant in the @xmath84 approximation .",
    "( iii ) it is plausible that the full account of the ll mixing might reconcile experimental results in the limit of vanishing disorder with the numerics .",
    "unfortunately , calculations for @xmath82 and @xmath94 are beyond our present capabilities .",
    "calculated at @xmath10 ( for @xmath68 ) with and without ll mixing , on the 2d layer width @xmath36 ( a ) and the magnetic field @xmath22 ( b).,width=326 ]    the dependence of gap @xmath17 on the magnetic field @xmath22 and finite layer width @xmath36 are displayed in fig .",
    "finite width was introduced to the model by the calculation of two - body coulomb matrix elements using 3d wavefunctions @xmath95 with @xmath96 for the normal direction .",
    "remarkably , @xmath97 is nonmonotonic , with a maximum between @xmath98 and 10  nm , depending on @xmath22 .",
    "while the reduced gaps are still about twice larger than the experimental values , the inclusion of even only @xmath78 excitations clearly improves the model .",
    "this suggests ll mixing as the main reason for the earlier @xmath17-discrepancy .",
    "let us now turn to the question of equivalence of the @xmath99 state realized in experiment and the model mr wavefunction .",
    "there is a subtle difference between the half - filled state and odd - denominator liquids like @xmath14 or @xmath15 . in the latter states , it is not merely incompressibility but also the form of correlations and many - body wavefunction that are robust against the variation of material , @xmath36 , or @xmath22  as long as the interaction pseudopotential is sufficiently strong ( superharmonic ) at short range , weak compared to the cyclotron energy , and strong compared to disorder . in contrast",
    ", the half - filled state remains incompressible for a wide class of electron  electron pseudopotentials , but the exact form of the wavefunction strongly depends on their details .",
    "this limits information that can be inferred about the nature of the state from the observation of its incompressibility .",
    "the underlying reason is the competition of at least two distinct wavefunctions sharing the same symmetry : the mr state , which can be defined as an exact ground state of a short - range three - body repulsion,@xcite and a clustered state characterized @xcite by the maximum avoidance of the next to the lowest value of the relative pair angular momentum , @xmath100 .",
    "the mr state is anticipated for the pair repulsion which is nearly harmonic at short range ( i.e. , with the pseudopotential decreasing linearly through @xmath101 , 3 , and 5 ) , such as in the ll@xmath1 . however , the overlaps of the actual coulomb eigenstates obtained from finite - size numerics ( in the @xmath49 approximation ) with the mr state are sensitive to the interaction parameters@xcite and surface curvature,@xcite raising the question of whether the @xmath10 fqh state and the mr model state are indeed ( qualitatively ) equivalent .",
    "( top ) and the squared overlap with the moore  read wavefunction ( bottom ) of the @xmath10 ground states calculated for @xmath68 with and without ll mixing , on the 2d layer width @xmath36 ( left ) and the magnetic field @xmath22 ( right).,width=326 ]    how does ll mixing affect this problem ? in the top frames of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we plot the squared projection @xmath102 onto the ll@xmath1 ( i.e. , onto the @xmath49 subspace ) of the same ground states @xmath103 whose gaps are shown in fig .  [ fig4 ] .",
    "it depends on @xmath36 and @xmath22 , but it is always significantly higher than @xmath85 or the ( not shown ) squared overlap with the @xmath49 ground state , in consequence of the coupling between intra- and inter - ll excitations in the @xmath84 space . in the bottom frames we plot the squared overlap @xmath104 with the mr state ( more precisely , with its particle  hole conjugate at @xmath51 ) .",
    "the small values for the @xmath49 calculation ( here , 0.75 to 0.80 ) may be to some extent an artifact of spherical geometry.@xcite however , a significant drop caused by the ll mixing ( e.g. , from 0.78 to 0.43 for @xmath105  nm and @xmath60  t ) suggests that the mr wavefunction may not be a very realistic description of the @xmath10 state in this range of parameters .",
    "this ambiguity and the difficulty with more realistic calculations make further experiments@xcite irreplaceable .",
    "we studied the effect of ll mixing on the @xmath10 fqh state .",
    "this effect is more pronounced than in the incompressible liquids of the lowest ll such as @xmath14 or @xmath15 ( even at the same magnetic field ) due to the richer inter - ll excitation spectrum .",
    "the resulting reduction of the excitation gap explains the troubling disparity between previous numerics ( without ll mixing ) and the experiments .",
    "this prediction agrees qualitatively with ref .   which included ll mixing in a different way .",
    "finally , the ll mixing significantly lowers overlaps with the mr wavefunction .",
    "this amplifies the need for the recently proposed@xcite experiments , designed to probe directly the nonabelian statistics of the qps at @xmath10 .",
