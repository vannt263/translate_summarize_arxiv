    "wolf - rayet ( w - r ) star mass - loss rates are inferred to be as high as several times @xmath0 , or @xmath1 times the mass - loss rate of the sun @xcite . more importantly , their mass - loss rates are significantly enhanced over their o - star progenitors , even though their luminosity is similar .",
    "* hereafter cak ) showed that o and b star winds can be driven by radiation pressure via the opacity of a large number of uv spectral lines , so the question arises if w - r winds may also be driven by line opacity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note this would require an enhancement in the effective line opacity in a w - r star , and in considering how this added opacity may come about , it is the goal of this paper to develop a conceptual language for discussing what additional difficulties emerge .    excellent agreement with observations is being achieved by detailed models @xcite , but conceptual uncertainties remain , including the maximum attainable driving efficiency , and the key differences between o and w - r winds that generate higher mass loss .",
    "also , it is not clear how sensitively the models rely on details in the line lists , and it would be advantageous to be able to generate simplified models that retain the key physics but are able to be extended to computationally demanding investigations such as hydrodynamic simulations . as a complement to such conceptually complex analyses , we will isolate particular wind properties important for driving w - r winds using simplified analytic expressions and approximations .",
    "because we are concerned with the mass - loss rate and not the global momentum deposition ( the latter stems in part from the former ) , our analysis is restricted to a local model at the critical point , which is the point deep in the wind where the mass flux is most difficult to drive .",
    "in addition , for simplicity and to get results that are as general as possible , we avoid identifying model - specific parameters such as the velocity law and the location where the critical point appears , as these are not fundamental to the overall mass driving . the goal is to analyze the impact of frequency redistribution on the mass flux in any optically thick line - driven flow , rather than to model a specific w - r star or create a grid of such models .",
    "since the role of line opacity is the central issue , and because the flows are observed to be highly supersonic , considerable conceptual progress may be made by invoking the sobolev approximation , as is typical in ob - star applications .",
    "some authors have questioned the use of the sobolev approximation in optically thick flows such as wolf - rayet winds . for example",
    "@xcite employ models in which the cak @xmath2 parameter , which describes the ratio of optically thick to optically thin lines , is essentially 0 , presumably due to the inclusion of very large turbulent velocities .",
    "@xcite argue that the wind mass - loss rate is determined near the sonic point , and therefore use static rosseland mean opacities in their analysis ( though they use cak - type line driving in the wind beyond the sonic point ) .",
    "in fact the sobolev approximation only breaks down if optically _ thick _",
    "lines overlap _ locally _ over their thermal linewidths .",
    "the approximation is not challenged by thin lines , or by thick lines that overlap only over the full wind broadening of thousands of km s@xmath3 rather than the tens of km s@xmath3 thermal speeds .",
    "the amount of local line overlap is related to the amount of turbulent broadening that is assumed . in the presence of very strong redistribution , as assumed in ",
    "[ sec : ssr ] , local line overlap increases the sobolev optical depths at the expense of the number of optically thick lines in a complicated way .",
    "thus we choose to focus on the possibility of relatively weak turbulence and therefore relatively little local line overlap .",
    "the sobolev approximation asserts that photon interactions with lines occur primarily due to doppler shifts that appear by virtue of bulk flow velocities , rather than thermal motions .",
    "this implies that each line interaction is spatially localized .",
    "due to the expansion of a stellar wind , a photon in the comoving frame will experience continuous doppler redshifting , loosely analogous to the hubble redshift , and will thus be able to eventually resonate with lines over a much wider frequency interval than the thermal width .",
    "the fractional doppler shift is thus limited only by the scale of the velocity changes @xmath4 , set by the terminal speed @xmath5 .",
    "the infleunce of the thermal speed is to determine the width of the regions in which a photon may resonate with a given line .",
    "this width is labeled the sobolev length @xmath6 and is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the thermal speed .",
    "to apply the sobolev approximation , we require that the mean free path between resonances with different lines be much larger than @xmath6 , and this is the sense in which lines must not overlap .",
    "the primary convenience of this approximation is that it turns the potentially large number of scatterings within a given resonance region into a single effective scattering , allowing the radiative transfer to be modeled as a random walk linking these effective scatterings .",
    "this type of effective opacity is determined not just by the density , but also by the velocity gradient , due to the continuous doppler shifting referred to above .",
    "the treatment of this type of opacity was pioneered by cak , and the resulting description of the wind dynamics is termed cak theory .",
    "cak theory describes a system in which a typical photon scatters at most once before escaping the wind . while adequate for ob stars , the large amount of momentum deposited in w - r winds requires a typical photon to scatter many times within the wind .",
    "this `` multiple scattering '' was introduced by @xcite , verified by @xcite using a monte carlo approach , and further refined by @xcite .",
    "to apply cak theory , it is convenient to scale the radiative acceleration on lines @xmath9 to the radiative acceleration on free electrons @xmath10 by the factor @xmath11 , called the force multiplier , @xmath12 @xmath11 depends on the optical depths @xmath13 across the sobolev length @xmath6 of all the lines in the distribution , which may be parametrized by @xmath14 , the column depth across @xmath6 in electron - scattering optical - depth units : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the free - electron cross - section per gram .",
    "the sobolev optical depth of line @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the cross - section per gram of line @xmath17 and @xmath20 is the local density , so @xmath21 .",
    "the heart of the cak approach is to parametrize @xmath11 by the relation @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath2 are obtained from the line - strength distribution .",
    "specifically , @xmath2 is a number between 0 and 1 that relates to the fraction of lines that are optically thick .",
    "@xmath11 depends on @xmath24 because the radiative force is saturated with respect to lines that are already thick , and so increases in @xmath14 merely dilute the force on such lines over more material .",
    "as an o star loses its hydrogen envelope and evolves into its w - r phase , its radius shrinks , and this has two immediate consequences for its wind .",
    "first , the smaller radius concentrates the column depth and hence increases the optical depth of a wind of given mass flux .",
    "second , since w - r stars maintain high luminosity , the reduced radius implies higher temperatures at the wind base .",
    "the main goal of this work is to understand how increases in temperature and optical depth affect the star s capacity for driving mass loss .",
    "an informative first step in such an analysis is to consider effectively gray opacity , combined with a non - isotropic diffusion treatment of the radiative transfer . indeed , although a truly gray opacity model requires there be no frequency dependence at all , in the absence of frequency redistribution there can be no correlation between the flux @xmath25 and the opacity @xmath26 , thus any redistribution - free model is _ effectively _ gray regardless of the opacity spectrum , neglecting weak frequency dependences in the diffusivity correction factor @xmath27 .",
    "the effectively gray model then allows cak - type theory to apply for appropriately flux - weighted opacities , even in the limit of multiple scattering in a wind with large total optical depth .    to calculate the momentum deposition rate for effectively gray opacity , one merely needs to know the average mean free path _ between _ lines , rather than within lines .",
    "the effective opacity of the lines @xmath28 is the mean probability of scattering per unit length , and is given by the expression ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath29 where @xmath17 represents a given line and the sum is done over all lines within an arbitrarily coarse - grained frequency step @xmath30 .",
    "the term @xmath31 is the probability of interacting with line @xmath17 , and @xmath30 is selected such that the sum over @xmath17 equals unity .",
    "when this criteria would require @xmath32 , so it is greater than the doppler shift over the whole wind , we truncate @xmath33 at this value . to emphasize the role of multiple scattering , we choose to express the effective opacity in optical - depth units ,",
    "@xmath34 such that the opacity parameter @xmath35 estimates the number of mean free paths due to line opacity over the full radial extent of the wind .      in the cak model the mass - loss rate",
    "is set at the critical point , which essentially occurs at the point where the force efficiency is at a minimum .",
    "any material that crosses the critical point will quickly accelerate , eventually reaching a terminal velocity @xmath5 .",
    "the mass - loss rate is assumed to be the maximum value that allows a force balance at the critical point , @xmath36 where the force due to gas pressure has been ignored , and @xmath37 is the acceleration due to gravity : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the gravitational constant and @xmath40 is the mass of the star .",

    "the limit of efficient frequency redistribution over a highly diffusive radiation field in a supersonically expanding wind allows the application of the statistical sobolev - rosseland ( ssr ) opacity approximation @xcite .",
    "this approximation asserts that completely redistributed source functions give rise to a diffusive flux that is inverse to the local frequency - dependent effective opacity , as holds for the rosseland mean in static photospheres , but the effective opacity is controlled by the sobolev approximation and is governed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : effopdepthcalc ] ) .",
    "since the radiative acceleration is governed by the frequency - integrated product of flux times opacity , the inverse correlation between them has important implications , and cak theory must be augmented by a consideration of the line frequency distribution , not just the line - strength distribution .",
    "since we wish to focus on the frequency dependence of the flux that is caused by the frequency dependence of the opacity , it is convenient to transform to a new frequency - like variable , such that the flux arising from truly gray opacity would be _ flat _ when expressed in terms of this variable .",

    "when such a gradient exists at the spatial scale over which photons diffuse prior to being redistributed in frequency , local gaps left by one ionization state of a given element may be filled by lines of another state located nearby .",
    "this in effect creates a globally gray line list and mitigates any local nongrayness , but is only effective over the length scale of frequency thermalization .",
    "thus the extreme redistribution limit would still reduce to the local ssr approximation , but finite thermalization lengths would yield results that are intermediate to the widely differing gray and ssr mass - loss rates derived above .      to obtain conceptual insight into the effect of ionization stratification on the overall mass - loss rate , we revisit the model of @xcite , where the line list is replaced by a simple model containing two frequency domains .",
    "one domain contains effective line opacity @xmath129 , while the other contains effective line opacity @xmath130 , both in optical depth units as usual .",
    "there is also a continuum opacity @xmath90 that spans both frequency domains .",
    "this model allows us to identify important characteristics of the system separately from the details of the line list , and is simple enough to permit analytic approximation even in the presence of spatial variations .    to account in a simple conceptual way for ionization stratification and its potential for filling the gaps globally , an additional complication is introduced to the plane - parallel model atmosphere that is used to signify the wind , as illustrated in figure [ fig : toymodel ] .",
    "in addition to dividing the frequency domain into two equal parts ( i.e. , with @xmath131 ) and supplying them with line optical depths @xmath129 and @xmath130 , the atmosphere is also divided equally into two physical - space regions , between which the opacities in each frequency domain are _ interchanged_. the total continuum optical depth @xmath90 pervades all domains and all regions , such that @xmath132 is the midpoint of the atmosphere where the opacity interchange is imposed , and the total optical depth within a given ionization zone and frequency domain @xmath17 is @xmath133 .",
    "this yields a kind of toy model of a wind that is globally gray ( as the total optical depth in both frequency domains is the same ) , but can be very nongray locally in each region . for conceptual purposes ,",
    "the radiative transfer is treated in the two - stream approximation , so that the mean intensity and flux are given in terms of intensity streams in the inward and outward directions : @xmath134 the depth variable is chosen to be the continuum optical depth , @xmath135 where @xmath17 is 1 or 2 to represent the two frequency domains .    to complete the radiative transfer solution for such an atmosphere ,",
    "it is necessary to specify the radiation sources .",
    "here we assume pure scattering in radiative equilibrium , but as mentioned above , a key issue is the degree of frequency redistribution per scattering .",
    "we assume for simplicity that the continuum opacity scatters coherently .",
    "@xcite showed that large amounts of line redistribution have a similar effect on the overall frequency dependent envelope of the radiative flux as does continuum redistribution .",
    "we allow the line opacity in one domain to redistribute photons into line opacity in the other domain , using a simple probabilistic approach .    to seek",
    "an extreme redistribution limit in such a model is to assert that all line scattering is completely redistributing , so that the probability that any scattering event within a given ionization stratum will be redistributing is @xmath136 for frequency domain 1 and @xmath137 for frequency domain 2 , where @xmath138 is the continuum optical depth within a single ionization zone .",
    "thus if the line opacity @xmath139 goes to 0 , no redistribution may occur in that domain , whereas if @xmath139 gets very large , redistribution becomes certain .",
    "however , not all redistribution will result in changing frequency domain , this must be accounted for with a separate probability that obeys the requirement of reciprocity and is independent of the original state of the photon . thus the probability of redistributing into a particular frequency domain , given that a redistribution has occurred , is @xmath140 for redistribution into domain 1 , and @xmath141 for domain 2 .",
    "therefore , the joint probability that a photon will scatter in frequency domain @xmath17 , redistribute , and result in frequency domain @xmath142 is @xmath143 . note that if @xmath139 goes to 0 , @xmath144 also goes to 0 , and no redistribution can occur into that domain .",
    "what is less obvious is that if @xmath145 goes to 0 , then @xmath144 goes to 1 , but @xmath146 , so the joint probability @xmath147 of redistributing from frequency domain @xmath142 into frequency domain @xmath17 , given that a scattering has occured in domain @xmath142 , is still 0 .",
    "the fact that eqs . ( [ eq : lambda1def])-([eq : w2def ] ) obey reciprocity may be seen from @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the complete probability of scattering in frequency domain @xmath17 and redistributing into domain @xmath142 .",
    "this condition is all that is required for eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lambda1def])-([eq : w2def ] ) to yield the ssr limit if all optical depths are sufficiently large and all gradients are sufficiently gradual .",
    "however , it is exactly the impact of more rapid gradients that is being explored by this simple model .",
    "the radiative transport equations that must be solved are @xmath150 where @xmath151 refers to the left side of the configuration space in figure [ fig : toymodel ] and @xmath152 refers to the right , and 1 denotes the frequency domain that initially contains @xmath129 while 2 denotes the frequency domain that initially contains @xmath130 .",
    "these equations may be recast by the following substitutions : @xmath153 and then eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rteq1])-([eq : rteq8 ] ) become @xmath154 where @xmath155 the solutions are @xmath156    the eight constants @xmath157 are found by using the following eight boundary conditions : ( _ i _ ) no photons enter the right side of the wind , @xmath158 where @xmath17 is 1 or 2 , so this represents two boundary conditions .",
    "( _ ii _ ) the fluxes and the mean intensities are continuous at the midpoint of the wind , @xmath159 which gives four more boundary conditions .",
    "( _ iii _ ) the stellar surface at the left of the atmosphere model is assumed to be highly redistributing , so that the incoming intensities on the left are unity , @xmath160 which gives the final two .",
    "figure [ fig : fe - vs - tau - ionstrat ] shows @xmath92 a tenth of the way through the wind , or about a continuum mean - free path from the left edge .",
    "the solid lines show the analytic solution , and indicate that there are two circumstances in which a globally gray wind can have a large force efficiency .",
    "not surprisingly , when @xmath161 , the opacity is truly gray , and @xmath162 .",
    "what is more surprising is that as @xmath130 is made optically thin , @xmath92 also increases , as the flux becomes more gray even though the opacity does not .",
    "this is because line emissivity dominates , so the line photons can only be redistributed into other lines .",
    "thus as @xmath130 decreases , there are fewer and fewer lines available to receive photons from the thick line region , so in effect the reciprocity condition prevents photons from leaving the thick line region even if that region contains highly redistributing opacity . indeed , if @xmath163 , then @xmath162 because no cross - redistribution can occur .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the ssr model , which assumes the limit of strong redistribution .",
    "the asterisks in figure [ fig : fe - vs - tau - ionstrat ] denote the locations in parameter space where the photons thermalize , which can be seen from the exponents of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : xlsoln ] ) and ( [ eq : xrsoln ] ) to be when @xmath164 . to the left of the frequency thermalization point ,",
    "the photons are not efficiently redistributed , so little anti - correlation between flux and opacity is set up , preventing a large drop in @xmath92 .",
    "this drop does appear to the right of the asterisk , where strong frequency thermalization occurs .",
    "the crosses denote the locations in parameter space where @xmath165 , which is roughly where the force reaches minimum efficiency .",
    "as @xmath130 gets larger than 1 , the gaps fill in and the wind becomes more gray , allowing a larger @xmath92 .",
    "thus @xmath165 is seen as the parameter regime where there is enough line opacity in the thin - line domain to significantly reduce the flux in the thick - line domain , but not enough to achieve multiscattering in the thin - line domain .",
    "thus we find that multiple momentum deposition becomes most difficult whenever the line opacity is distributed such that each ionization zone covers about a single photon mean - free path for a significant flux - weighted fraction of the frequency spectrum .",
    "_ either _ less or more nongrayness in the opacity will achieve higher overall force efficiencies .      with the schematic two - domain results in mind , we now return to the real line lists .",
    "we have seen that the radiative flux will respond to the opacity as though it was effectively gray over scales much shorter than the frequency thermalization length , which corresponds to some finite range in temperature and may include multiple ionization strata . over this range",
    ", frequency thermalization will take hold and drive the flux toward a coarse - grained version of the ssr limit , so the opacity must be appropriately averaged over the ionization states present . in this picture , the coarse - grained average ssr opacity controls the local flux , which then interacts with truly local opacity to determine the radiative acceleration at each point .    again",
    ", we use the model assumptions in table [ table : assumpt ] .",
    "the temperature model of la93 , chosen because of its simplicity and emphasis on fundamental processes rather than its completeness relative to more sophisticated models , is used to determine the characteristic maximum range in temperature , some subset of which would correspond to the frequency thermalization length . in their model ,",
    "the temperature ranges from about @xmath166 at the stellar surface to about @xmath167 at the free - electron photosphere . without more detailed redistribution calculations ( such as carried out by @xcite ) , the appropriate temperature range corresponding to a thermalization depth is unclear , so we consider temperature ranges of @xmath168 , @xmath169 , and @xmath170 in an effort to span the possibilities .",
    "figures [ ld - f - multitemp1 ] , [ ld - f - multitemp2 ] , and [ ld - f - multitemp3 ] show the average effective line optical depths from the kurucz list for these three temperature ranges , respectively .",
    "notice that the gaps begin to fill in as the lower temperature limit reaches @xmath171 , and this continues as still lower temperatures are included .",
    "however , we do not encounter contributions from a large number of ionization states , in seeming contradiction with la93 but in agreement with the results of @xcite . for example",
    ", the latter author found that only two stages of iron have a significant impact on the line - driven mass - loss rate , and this limits the effectiveness of ionization stratification .",
    "tables [ table : ionstrat ] and [ table : ionstratop ] show the effect on the force efficiency and mass - loss rate of including a range in temperatures before applying the ssr flux approximation .",
    "the kurucz list results are again insufficient to describe w - r winds .",
    "the op list results go as high as @xmath172 . while such mass - loss rates have been observed @xcite , for this to be an upper limit on w - r mass - loss would require large amounts of clumping correction .",
    "this mass - loss rate would also require a flux themalization length of about 3 stellar radii to correspond to the required temperature range in the la93 model , and this seems unrealistically large given the large potential for redistribution found by @xcite .",

    "the starting point of this analysis was to recognize that as long as ion thermal speeds are not artificially enhanced by turbulent processes ( as considered by * ? ? ? * ) , the sobolev approximation is entirely applicable to optically thick w - r winds .",
    "thus cak theory is applicable after modifying for the effects of diffuse radiation on the ionization and the angle dependence of the radiative flux , and it is found that lines are able to drive abundant mass loss under hot w - r plasma conditions . however , the ubiquitous presence of frequency redistribution in an optically thic flow introduces significant challenges to achieving large line - driven w - r mass - loss rates , and so the rate of frequency thermalization is critical for quantifying how redistribution affects the efficiency of line driving .    with rapid enough thermalization , the radiative flux avoids large opacity domains , resulting in force efficiencies well below what is needed to drive the observed w - r mass - loss rates .",
    "this drop in force efficiency in a highly redistributing optically thick wind may only be avoided by filling the gaps locally , which requires the discovery of new lines in regions of the spectrum that are less densely packed .",
    "our test calculation demonstrated that the greatest challenge to driving efficiency is presented by spectral domains in which optically thick lines barely overlap over the wind terminal speed , since regions where the lines are sparse are less likely to be redistributed into , and regions where the lines are dense are already effective at line driving .    if , on the other hand , the thermalization rate is slow enough to sample a wide range in ionization strata , then gray - type force efficiencies may in principle be recovered .",
    "however , in practice the line lists do not appear to exhibit sufficiently rich contributions from the many different ionization states to achieve widespread filling - in of the spectrum . as a result ,",
    "frequency redistribution into domains with relatively little line overlap continues to present a severe challenge to obtaining line - driven winds with large frequency - averaged optical depth , as would be required to attain the largest of the wolf - rayet mass - loss rates inferred from observations . in short",
    ", there still does not exist _ a priori _ opacity - driven models of supersonically accelerating optically thick winds with low turbulent broadening and non - static opacity treatments that can explain how a smaller and hotter w - r star can have a dramatically enhanced mass - loss rate .",
    "either the opacity is still incomplete and new lines are capable of filling in the line - poor domains , or else clumping corrections reduce the need for w - r mass fluxes to substantially exceed those of their cooler , larger , and h - rich cousins , the extreme of stars .",
    "in addition , it should be noted that up - to - date opacity treatments from the opacity project @xcite and the opal opacity tables @xcite are of static type so are not in their purest form applicable to w - r winds .",
    "they must first be re - evaluated as expansion - type opacities , such as the method of @xcite or the ssr mean used here , possibly also incorporating more exact radiative transfer @xcite or non - sobolev opacity corrections @xcite , before they may be appropriately applied to further investigations into the role of high - temperature opacity contributions ( such as the `` iron bump '' ) in explaining high w - r mass fluxes .",
    "furthermore , the critical point must not be artificially placed in regions of exceptionally high opacity , as this would belie the meaning of the critical point as the `` choke point '' of wind acceleration . ",
    "it must also be mentioned that although clumping corrections reduce both the inferred w - r mass - loss rates and the difficulty in explaining them with existing line opacities , clumping itself may introduce dynamical challenges .",
    "this is not a problem for clumps smaller than the sobolev length @xmath6 , but larger clumps will reduce the force efficiency in ways that are classifiable according to whether the clumps are optically thin or thick to most photons . when the clumps are thin , their impact is felt only through the role of density and velocity in standard cak theory , but when the clumps are thick ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , additional reductions in the force efficiency must appear owing to the feedback onto the self - consistent radiative flux , in a manner again similar to the spirit of a rosseland mean @xcite .",
    "the development and dynamical implications of such clumps require detailed radiation hydrodynamic simulations , but the simplified approaches developed here may be used to guide approximations that make such a time - dependent calculation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) computationally tractable .",
    "finally , the most important goal of this paper has been to develop a conceptual vocabulary to discuss the circumstances under which a w - r wind may or may not be efficiently driven by sobolev - type line opacity .",
    "key elements of this vocabulary include the effectively gray optical depth @xmath88 , the nongray force efficiency @xmath182 , the nongrayness parameter @xmath102 for the monotonically reordered line distribution , and the range of ionization strata that contribute within a photon frequency thermalization length .",
