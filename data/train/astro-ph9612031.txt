    "galaxies around low redshift ( @xmath5 ) quasars have been studied extensively by various authors ( gehren et al .",
    "1984 , green and yee 1988 , hintzen et al .",
    "1991 , ellingson , yee and green 1991 , fried 1991 ) ; there is general agreement that low redshift radio - loud quasars are found in moderately rich galaxy clusters with richness classes @xmath6 .",
    "radio - quiet qsos are usually found in less dense environments .",
    "green and yee ( 1988 ) and fried ( 1991 ) have found evidence for an evolution of the environment between redshift @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the sense that the qso - galaxy covariance amplitude is larger at @xmath8 .    at redshifts @xmath9 associations between different types of agn and galaxies",
    "have been sought by tyson 1986 , hintzen , romanishin and valdes 1991 , fried , stickel and khr 1993 , hutchings , crampton and persram 1993 , hutchings , crampton and johnson 1995 , boyle and couch 1993 , and benitez et al .",
    "these works are based on imaging data with limiting magnitudes around @xmath10 . since a galaxy with @xmath11 appears as faint as @xmath12 at redshift @xmath13 ( choosing @xmath14 , @xmath15 and applying an r - band k - correction of 2 mag according to metcalfe et al .",
    "( 1991 ) ) this implies that galaxies associated with qsos at @xmath16 can be detected in such data only if they are overluminous by @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , only the brightest members of possible associated clusters can be detected .",
    "the results of these studies are discrepant , there are claims both for and against excess numbers of galaxies ( a detailed discussion is given below ) . since redshifts of these galaxies",
    "are not available , the excess numbers of galaxies are interpreted either as true physical association of these galaxies with the qsos or as foreground galaxies acting as gravitational lenses .    in this paper",
    "we present data on the fields around 3 quasars .",
    "the quasars were selected from the catalogue of veron & veron ( 1993 ) ; they are all radio - loud and have redshifts @xmath18 ( pks 2216 - 03 ) , @xmath19 ( pks 2356 + 196 ) and @xmath1 ( ot 566 ) .",
    "the data are complete for galaxies to @xmath2 and thus allow detection of galaxies at the redshifts of the quasars down to @xmath20 .",
    "the data were originally taken to search for a possible galaxy excess around the quasars ; this is discussed in section 3.1 .",
    "it was also found that the data have implications for gravitational lensing ( section 3.2 ) . in section 3.3",
    "it is shown that the size of the absorber in the line of sight to pks 2216 - 03 may have been severely overestimated .",
    "the direct images presented here were obtained at the prime focus of the 3.5 m telescope on calar alto , spain .",
    "all observations were made in the r - filter band .",
    "a ccd with 640x1024 pixels of @xmath21 was used as detector .",
    "the long exposure times which are necessary to reach faint light levels were broken into many shorter exposures of 500 sec each , with the telescope moved between the exposures by several steps of @xmath22 each in right ascension and/or declination ; flatfields for each night were constructed from an unregistered median of the individual frames .",
    "the frames were debiased , flatfielded and then registered . to correct cosmic ray events ,",
    "the median and sigma for each pixel were calculated for 6 - 8 registered frames ; those pixels which deviated more than @xmath23 from the smoothed median were replaced by the median .",
    "this procedure removes cosmic ray events very effectively even in the flanks of stellar images .",
    "these cosmic ray free frames were then summed to construct the final coadded images .",
    "it should be emphasized that the median is used only for constructing a flatfield and for correction of cosmic events , since steidel and hamilton ( 1993 ) have shown that the median operation changes the true intensity distribution of objects close to the sky level .",
    "the total integration times are between 13.5 ksec and 26.0 ksec ; the @xmath24 surface brightness limits are between @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the central parts of the three fields are shown in figure 1 .",
    "since the weather was not photometric during the whole observing run , frames of the three objects obtained during photometric conditions were calibrated with observations of standard stars , and these calibrations were used to scale the final coadded images .",
    "photometric errors due to atmospheric instabilities should be less than 0.1 mag .",
    "the seeing was acceptable throughout the whole observing run ; the coadded images have psfs with fwhm @xmath27 .    [ images ]    the detection of objects and separation into stars ,",
    "galaxies and image defects was done using the focas software ( valdes 1982 ) .",
    "the completeness limit can easily be determined from differential number counts ( fig.2 ) .",
    "these number counts are _ not _ corrected for incompleteness due to diminishing detection probability of the objects near the faint end and thus demonstrate clearly that the data are complete for galaxies down to @xmath28 magnitude .",
    "the data are well fitted by a linear relation @xmath29 .",
    "the slope and constant are @xmath30 and @xmath31 for ot566 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 for pks2216 - 038 , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 for pks2356 - 196 in very good agreement with other determinations reaching @xmath36 ( tyson 1988 , steidel and hamilton 1993 , metcalfe et al.1995 , smail et al .",

    "a possible excess of galaxies around the quasars is most easily detected on plots of galaxy surface density ( galaxies per square degree ) as a function of projected distance from the quasars .",
    "foreground clusters of galaxies should show up in the @xmath37 subsample , whereas clusters of galaxies associated with the quasars should show up in the @xmath38 subsample because the apparent magnitudes would be in this range ( see introduction ) . from figure 3",
    "it is evident that the galaxy surface density is constant , i.e. there is no evidence for a galaxy excess in either field . in table 1 ,",
    "the number of galaxies counted within various radii from the quasars is compared to the number expected from background . since there is no radial gradient in the data ,",
    "the background has been taken as the mean over each individual field . however , while fig.3 and table 1 suggest that there is no galaxy excess in any of the 3 fieds , statistical fluctuations in the background could exceed the number of galaxies expected for poor clusters .",
    "table 2 lists the ratio of expected numbers of galaxies within certain radii for abell clusters of richness classes 0 - 3 and the @xmath24 poisson fluctuations in the background counts .",
    "the number of galaxies expected within a given radius was integrated for a king profile with core radius @xmath39 ( bahcall 1975 ) and the total numbers of cluster members were taken as the mean of the population numbers for each richness class given by abell 1958 .",
    "all counts were taken as the mean of the 3 fields .",
    "table 2 shows that foreground clusters can be excluded on a @xmath40 level , clusters associated with the quasars only for richness classes greater than 1",
    ".    [ ring ]    [ cluster1 ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     these galaxies appear very similar to the ones seen in the fields of the quasars . from redshift surveys it is known that galaxies with @xmath41 have median redshift @xmath42 ( glazebrook et al .",
    "therefore it appears reasonable to assume that the galaxies close to lines of sight to the quasars , too , are at @xmath43 ; if so they are foreground to the quasars and amplify the light from the quasars by gravitational lensing .",
    "since redshifts and velocity dispersions of these galaxies are unknown , only crude estimates of the amount of lensing can be made : assuming @xmath44 and velocity dispersions for the lenses @xmath45 and @xmath46 , the formula given by turner , ostriker and gott ( 1984 ) gives amplification factors 1.2 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the required masses are a few @xmath47 and for a typical magnitude @xmath48 ( see table 2 ) one obtains an absolute magnitude @xmath49 using the chosen cosmology and a k - dimming and evolution correction of @xmath50 according to metcalfe et al .",
    "therefore , these possible lenses would have masses and absolute magnitudes like typical bright galaxies .",
    "it should be noted that pks 2216 - 038 is included in the complete 1 jy sample of radio sources ; since its radio flux at 6 cm wavelength is 1.5 jy , this object may have entered the sample because it is lensed .",
    "further evidence for lensing in this object has been given by bartelmann , schneider and hasinger ( 1994 ) ; they have found a correlation between x - ray emission from foreground galaxy clusters and high - redshift radio - loud quasars from the 1 jy - sample .",
    "pks2216 - 038 is among the objects which show the highest correlation .",
    "the integral surface density of galaxies @xmath51 is @xmath52 ( mean of the three fields ) ; this results in a projected mean distance between galaxies of only @xmath53 .",
    "thus it is evident that many lines of sight to background ( i.e. @xmath16 ) objects pass close enough by a galaxy that they are affected by lensing .",
    "fig.4 shows the probability distribution of the amplification factor for the field of ot566 ( the other fields give practically identical results ) .",
    "this was computed by putting random points into the field , and then calculating the distance to the nearest neighbor and the resulting amplification with the formula given by turner , ostriker and gott ( 1984 ) for velocity dispersions of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , which correspond to mean galaxy masses of @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "these masses are in good agreement with recent dynamical mass estimates for nearby galaxies ( zaritsky and white 1994 ) and for faint galaxies within the magnitude range @xmath58 ( brainerd , blandford and smail , preprint ) .",
    "the redshifts of the lenses were distributed randomly between 0 and 1 , and for the source we have taken @xmath59 .",
    "the assumed redshifts affect the result only weakly over a very wide range of redshifts .",
    "the diagram shows that the bulk of amplification factors relative to an empty line of sight is between 1.1 and 1.5 , the effect of lensing thus is moderate . from the width of the distribution of the amplification factors it is also obvious that lensing imposes a scatter on the observed luminosity function of distant objects .",
    "it must be emphasized that the assumptions on the velocity dispersions of the galaxies made for these estimations affect the amplification factor only quantitavely ; the qualitative conclusion , that distant objects must be lensed by foreground galaxies , is based purely on the observed galaxy surface density .",
    "we are therefore _ forced _ to conclude that distant ( @xmath16 ) objects are lensed by foreground galaxies . on theoretical grounds",
    "this was anticipated by press and gunn ( 1973 ) , who had concluded that all distant objects in a @xmath60 cosmology are lensed .",
    "[ ampli ]    it is interesting to estimate the effects of microlensing .",
    "the optical depth @xmath61 to microlensing is equal to the ratio of the surface density of the microlensing matter to the critical mass density @xmath62 where @xmath63 and all symbols have their usual meaning .",
    "@xmath64 can be calculated from the chosen cosmology and the assumed redshifts @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the surface mass density of the lensing matter can be estimated for elliptical galaxies from @xmath67 where the subscript",
    "e denotes the effective radius .",
    "since @xmath68 we obtain @xmath69 . taking @xmath70 and @xmath71 gives @xmath72 .",
    "for the random points which were put into the galaxy field of ot566 ( see above ) , the mean distance to the nearest neighbor is about @xmath73 or @xmath74 ; scaling @xmath61 according to the @xmath75-law gives a mean optical depth to gravitational microlensing of @xmath76 .",
    "this is well below unity , showing that microlensing by galaxies with @xmath77 is not very important .",
    "an optical depth @xmath78 would require a galaxy surface density about 15 times the one measured to @xmath77 .",
    "now , the differential galaxy number counts rise continuously to @xmath2 with an increase in galaxy surface density by about a factor 2.3 per mag .",
    "the counts of smail et al .",
    "( 1995 ) show that this continues to @xmath79 with no indication of a declining slope .",
    "if the counts would rise continuously to @xmath80 , then the nearest neighbor distance @xmath81 and thereby @xmath82 .",
    "evidence that all distant objects are indeed microlensed has been given by hawkins ( 1993 ) ; he measured the lightcurves of many qsos and found that the origin of variability of high - redshift qsos ( @xmath16 ) is not instrinsic to the qsos , but rather caused by microlensing .",
    "since hawkins and veron ( 1993 ) had previously shown that virtually _ all _ qsos are variable to some extent , these results present strong evidence that all distant objects are actually microlensed .",
    "accidentally the quasar pks 2216 - 038 was also included in the sample of le brun et al .",
    "( 1993 ) who were searching for galaxies close to quasars with mgii @xmath83 absorption lines in their spectra .",
    "le brun et al .",
    "( 1993 ) report a possible detection of this absorption line at a redshift @xmath84 and identified a galaxy 34 arcsec away from the quasar as absorber ; this galaxy would have a large halo of @xmath85 kpc radius . however , as fig .",
    "1 shows there are several galaxies within few arcsecs to the line of sight to the quasar .",
    "these galaxies have apparent magnitudes around @xmath48 ; at the absorption line redshift their absolute magnitudes would be @xmath86 ( neglecting k - correction and evolution , but both effects are small at such low redshifts ) .",
    "york et al.(1986 ) have shown that even low - luminosity galaxies such as the magellanic clouds can cause absorption lines in the spectra of distant objects .",
    "therefore , the galaxies few arcsec from the quasar can well be the true absorbers ; if so , the size of the halo of the absorbing galaxy given by lebrun et al .",
    "( 1993 ) may be severely overestimated . due to the high surface density of faint galaxies , cases like pks 2216 - 038",
    "may not be exceptional and may at least in some cases lead to severe overestimation of the sizes of galaxy halos .",
    "we have presented very deep direct images of the fields of three quasars with redshifts between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "counts of galaxies which are complete down to @xmath2 give no evidence for a galaxy excess around the quasars in any of the three fields .",
    "we find no evidence for foreground clusters ; associated galaxy clusters with richness classes larger than 1 are excluded .",
    "two of the quasars have faint galaxies within few arcsec to their line of sight ; since these galaxies are almost certainly foreground , the quasars are lensed with amplification factors probably between 1.2 and 2 .",
    "the high surface density of galaxies leads to the conclusion that virtually all distant @xmath16 objects are affected by gravitational lensing .",
    "the bulk of amplification factors relative to an empty beam are estimated to be in the range 1.1 to 1.5 .",
    "the quasar pks 2216 - 038 may also have an mgii absorption line at @xmath87 in its spectrum ; if one of the galaxies detected in our image is the true absorber , then only a moderately sized halo of 10 kpc radius is required in contrast to claims of a huge 102 kpc halo .",
