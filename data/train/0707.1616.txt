    "networks have attracted a burst of attention in the last decade ( useful reviews include refs .",
    "@xcite ) , with applications to natural , social , and technological networks . of great current interest is the identification of the modular structure of the network .",
    "detecting modules , or communities , allows quantitative investigation of relevant subnetworks , which may have different properties from the aggregate properties of the network as a whole , e.g. , modules in the world wide web are sets of topically related web pages .    informally , a network module is a subgraph whose vertices are more likely to be connected to one another than to the vertices outside the subgraph .",
    "a variety of approaches @xcite have been taken to explore this concept . see refs .",
    "@xcite for useful reviews .    in this work we focus on the measure called modularity , introduced by @xcite .",
    "modularity reflects the extent , relative to a null model network , to which edges are formed within modules instead of between modules . using the modularity",
    ", we can assess the quality of any assignment of vertices to modules .",
    "further , the module identification problem becomes a modularity optimization problem .",
    "however , exact maximization of the modularity is in general an intractable problem , because the number of ways to partition the set of vertices grows extremely rapidly @xcite . in light of this ,",
    "a number of effective algorithms have been introduced to find high modularity partitions of the vertices @xcite .",
    "the modularity can be also be defined in terms of a so - called modularity matrix , the eigenspectrum of which has a fundamental relationship with the modular nature of the network @xcite .",
    "given the explicit dependence of the modularity upon a null model , it is clear that the specific choice of null model has a profound impact on the modularity .",
    "surprisingly , only one null model has been so far explored at length : networks with edges randomly assigned such that the expected degrees of model - network vertices equal the actual degrees of corresponding real - network vertices @xcite .",
    "specific classes of networks have additional constraints that could be and , indeed , should be reflected in the null model .",
    "a significant such class of networks is that of bipartite networks .",
    "the vertices of a bipartite network can be partitioned into two disjoint sets such that no two vertices within the same set are adjacent .",
    "there are thus two distinct kinds of vertices , providing a natural representation for many affiliation or interaction networks , with one kind of vertex representing actors and the other representing relations . examples of actor - relation pairs include people attending events @xcite , court justices making decisions @xcite , scientists jointly publishing articles @xcite , organizations collaborating in projects @xcite , and legislators serving on committees @xcite . arguably , bipartite networks are the empirically standard case for social networks and other interaction networks , with unipartite networks appearing  often implicitly  as projections .    in the statistical physics community , the usual approach taken to identify modules in bipartite networks is to first construct a unipartite projection of one part of the network , and then identify modules in that projection using methods for unipartite networks .",
    "for example , in the scientist - publication network mentioned above , a network of scientists is created by linking scientists when they have jointly published .",
    "these unipartite projection can be illuminating , but intrinsically lose information  indeed , @xcite demonstrate that analysis of an unweighted , unipartite projection can give unreliable or incorrect results .    the principal contribution in this work",
    "is a proposed definition of a modularity for bipartite networks .",
    "the approach taken is based on defining a bipartite modularity matrix @xmath0 as an extension of the recent work by @xcite .",
    "some key properties of the eigenspectrum of @xmath0 are identified and used to specialize newman s matrix - based algorithms to bipartite networks .",
    "an additional algorithm fundamentally based on the bipartite character of the networks is introduced ; we call the algorithm brim , for bipartite , recursively induced modules .    in parallel ,",
    "@xcite have independently investigated modularity in bipartite networks .",
    "they proceed by first identifying the two parts of the network as actors and teams , and then formulating a bipartite modularity in which modules consist of groups of actors that are closely interconnected based on joint participation in many teams .",
    "the resulting modularity is thus focused on identifying modules in only one part of the network at a time .",
    "interesting , @xcite point out the possibilities of classifying both partite sets of the network simultaneously and of customizing spectral methods for bipartite networks , which is essentially the approach taken in the present work .    as of this writing , we are aware of no other attempts to define modularity for bipartite networks .",
    "however bipartite networks , or `` two mode networks , '' have undergone several related studies in the sociology community using other methods ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in we define a modularity matrix and measure for bipartite networks .",
    "we discuss using the bipartite modularity matrix to identify modules in , and apply the algorithm therein devised to two real - world networks in .",
    "finally , we conclude in with an assessment of the present investigation and an outlook for future work .",
    "in this section , we develop a modularity matrix for bipartite networks . structurally and notationally , the development parallels the discussion of the modularity matrix by @xcite .    consider a network with @xmath1 vertices and @xmath2 edges defined by an adjacency matrix @xmath3 .",
    "each vertex @xmath4 is assigned to a community group or module , denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "the modularity @xmath6 for such an assignment reflects the extent , relative to a null model , to which edges are formed within modules instead of between modules .",
    "formally , the modularity is defined as @xmath7 where the @xmath8 are the adjacency matrix elements and the @xmath9 are probabilities in the null model that an edge exists between vertices @xmath4 and @xmath10 .    the modularity can be given an equivalent definition in matrix form .",
    "first , the @xmath1 community indices @xmath11 with values taken from @xmath12 are replaced by an @xmath13 index matrix @xmath14 } $ ] , where @xmath15 is the number of modules . all elements of @xmath16",
    "take on either a 0 or 1 value , so that column @xmath17 is an index vector showing membership in module @xmath4 ; a value of 1 in position @xmath10 of @xmath17 indicates that vertex @xmath10 belongs to module @xmath4 .",
    "given that each vertex is assigned to exactly one module , each row of @xmath16 has a single unit value and the index vectors are thus orthogonal .",
    "further , a modularity matrix @xmath0 is defined with elements @xmath18 using @xmath16 and @xmath0 , the modularity becomes @xmath19 the eigenspectrum of @xmath0 has a fundamental relationship with the modular nature of the network , as @xcite has explored .    from , it is apparent that the choice of null model has a profound impact on the modularity .",
    "thus , for example , a bernoulli random graph with constant @xmath20 for all @xmath4 and @xmath10 is a poor representation of most real - world networks , so would be an inappropriate choice of null model .",
    "instead , the usual choice of null model @xcite assigns edges at random with the expected degrees of model vertices constrained to match the degrees in the actual network .    in much the same fashion ,",
    "bipartite networks have specific constraints that should be reflected in the null model .",
    "the vertices of a bipartite network can be partitioned into two disjoint sets such that no two vertices within the same set are adjacent .",
    "an equivalent , but more visual , definition is that the vertices in a bipartite graph can be assigned one of two colors , say red and blue , with no neighboring vertices bearing the same color . in the remainder of this section , we will define a null model with the above requirement that the expected degrees match the degrees in the real network , along with the additional constraint that each edge links a red vertex and a blue vertex .",
    "let @xmath21 be the number of red vertices and @xmath22 be the number of blue vertices ; this implies @xmath23 . without loss of generality ,",
    "assume that the vertices are indexed so that red vertices are labeled @xmath24 and the blue vertices are labeled @xmath25 .",
    "the adjacency matrix then has a block off - diagonal form of @xmath26 } {       \\begin{array}{cc }          { { \\mathbf{o}}}_{{\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{p}}{\\times}{\\ensuremath{p } } } } } & { { \\mathbf{\\tilde{a}}}}_{{\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{p}}{\\times}{\\ensuremath{q } } } } } \\\\",

    "the all - zero blocks on the diagonal are the potential modularity contributions from pairs of vertices of the same color being present in a module ; all meaningful contributions , positive or negative , to the modularity thus are made by pairs of vertices with distinct colors .",
    "in contrast , with the usual null model based on unipartite networks @xcite , the corresponding blocks contain only negative elements ( or zeros for isolated nodes of degree zero ) , always providing a modularity penalty for pairs of like - colored vertices in the same module .",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath32 where @xmath33 . since @xmath34",
    "when all vertices are in the same module , we can set all @xmath35 and @xmath36 equal , giving @xmath37 so that @xmath38 thus , the expected number of edges in the null model must equal the number of edges in the actual network .",
    "the degrees of the red vertices are given by @xmath39 , while those of the blue vertices are given by @xmath40 . by constraining the expected degrees in the null model to match the actual degrees , as discussed above",
    ", we obtain @xmath41 since @xmath42 ensure that holds .    in the usual null model ,",
    "the probability of an edge being present between two vertices is proportional to the product of the degrees of the vertices . for the bipartite case , this becomes @xmath43 for some constant @xmath44 . combining this definition with ,",

    ", we have fully defined the modularity @xmath6 for a bipartite network .",
    "using the modularity defined in , we can assess the quality of any partitioning of the vertices of a bipartite graph into modules .",
    "a partitioning can be determined using any method .",
    "two general approaches seem relevant .",
    "first , the modularity defined in can be maximized using standard optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithms , greedy search methods @xcite , or extremal optimization @xcite ; this is generally straightforward and will not be discussed at length in this work .",
    "second , the spectral properties of @xmath0 or other matrices associated with the graph can be analyzed to partition the vertices into modules .",
    "for example , one standard partitioning approach is to assign the vertices to modules using spectral partitioning ( sp ) . in spectral",
    "partitioning , the eigenvectors of the network laplacian are used to minimize the number of edges running between groups .",
    "the sp approach has a significant drawback : the vertices are assigned to modules of predetermined size .",
    "this is problematic for the investigation of real - world networks , where the number and sizes of community groups are not generally known in advance .",
    "an analogous approach based on the spectral properties of the modularity matrix @xmath0 has recently been proposed @xcite .",
    "since the modularity is conceptually closer to our understanding of network community structure , this spectral optimization of modularity ( som ) is better tailored for real world networks .",
    "an important special case in both spectral partitioning and spectral optimization of modularity is to assign the vertices to two groups based on a single eigenvector of the laplacian ( sp ) or modularity ( som ) matrix . in the case of sp ,",
    "we are interested in the eigenvector corresponding to the smallest positive eigenvalue ; this is the fiedler vector . for som , we are interested in the leading eigenvector @xmath48 , corresponding to the largest positive eigenvalue @xmath49 of @xmath0 ; we propose calling this the _ newman vector_. using the newman vector , we approximate @xmath0 as @xmath50 with just two modules , @xmath51 } } $ ] , so that the modularity in becomes @xmath52 recall that the index vectors @xmath53 and @xmath54 take on values from @xmath55 .",

    "the use of multiple of eigenvectors allows more than two modules to be considered ( @xmath59 ) , with at most one module more than the number of positive eigenvalues of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "additional eigenvectors of @xmath0 can also be used for som @xcite in a vector partitioning algorithm adapted from spectral partitioning @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we will not make use of this algorithm , nor of a recursive bipartitioning approach , instead developing an alternative technique that capitalizes on the bipartite nature of the networks .      in ,",
    "we have seen how to identify community groups of networks by using the newman vector to maximize @xmath6 . however , we made no use of the bipartite character of the networks .",

    "if we shift our attention from the spectral decomposition of @xmath0 to the singular value decomposition ( svd ) of @xmath72 , we therefore automatically exclude the eigenvectors of @xmath0 that correspond to negative eigenvalues .",
    "the appearance of the singular vectors of @xmath72 is not surprising .",

    "this maximizes the magnitude of the inner products in , with consistent assignment of both red and blue vertices to the same module based on the signs ensuring that positive contributions are made to the modularity .      in ,",
    "we have seen how the leading eigenvector of @xmath0 and the leading singular vectors of @xmath72 can be used to bipartition network vertices . extending these methods to use the full modularity matrices and to handle more than two modules",

    "however , for the bipartite case at least , there is a relatively straightforward extension that leads to a useful algorithm .",
    "first , we assume that the blue vertices are all assigned to modules through some mechanism .",

    "we now write in terms of explicit sums , so that @xmath89 the inner sum in is a sum across the rows of @xmath75 .",
    "since each row of @xmath75 consists of a single 1 with all other elements being 0 , the modularity is now simple to maximize : we just assign red vertex @xmath4 to module @xmath90 such that @xmath91 is the maximum of the @xmath4th row of @xmath92 .. ]    conversely , if the red vertices are all assigned to modules , maximizing @xmath6 consists of assigning the blue vertices to modules .",
    "analogously to the previous case , we define @xmath93 and manipulate into the form @xmath94 as with the red vertices , we maximize @xmath6 by assigning the @xmath10th blue vertex to the module @xmath90 such that @xmath95 is the maximum of the @xmath10th row of @xmath96 .    taken together , these two maximization procedures define an algorithm that we call brim(bipartite , recursively induced modules ) .",
    "the brimalgorithm is an iterative algorithm for maximizing @xmath6 , with the sets of red and blue vertices each recursively drawing the other into modular structures .",
    "for each iteration , @xmath6 is guaranteed never to decrease , as it is always possible at least to maintain the previous vertex partitioning and keep the modularity the same .",
    "therefore , the brimalgorithm will always find a partition at a maximum of @xmath6 .",
    "in general , the identified partition will correspond to a local maximum in @xmath6 , not the global maximum .",
    "note that the brimalgorithm can work with the entire @xmath72 matrix , or a rank - restricted approximation calculated by omitting the smallest singular values . by using the full @xmath72 matrix",
    ", we automatically include all positive contributions to the modularity .",
    "as well , the algorithm can work with any assumed number of modules ; however , no constraint exists to ensure that each module is occupied .    to test the efficacy of the brimalgorithm , we apply it to a simple model network .",
    "the model consists of @xmath97 modules , each containing @xmath98 red and @xmath99 blue vertices .",
    "an edge exists between a red vertex and a blue vertex with probability @xmath100 if they are in the same module and with probability @xmath101 if they are in different modules .",
    "no edges exist between vertices with the same color .    the qualitative behavior of the model depends on @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "when @xmath102 , there is a greater probability of vertices within a module being linked than vertices in different modules , matching our intuitive notion of modularity . with @xmath100 sufficiently close to one and @xmath101 small , the actual modular structure of a particular realization of the model should correspond to the assumed modular structure .",
    "as @xmath103 , the network becomes more uniform , with the assumed modular structure ultimately vanishing and all vertices belonging to a single module .",
    "and @xmath104 calculated from the expectation values .",
    "however , for the bipartite network model under consideration , the base case , with edges only existing between vertices in the same module , will often be excluded using this approach . ]",
    "lower values of @xmath100 introduce additional substructure into the modules ; the general behavior as @xmath101 varies should be similar to the previous case , but with an overall reduced correspondence between the assumed modules and the actual modules in networks instantiated from the model .    following @xcite , we make precise the above qualitative description in terms of the normalized mutual information @xmath105 .",
    "consider two schemes @xmath106 and @xmath107 for dividing the @xmath108 vertices into community groups , represented by two index matrices @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the two index matrices are used to calculate the so - called confusion matrix @xmath111 , which takes the simple form @xmath112 the probability @xmath113 that a vertex is assigned to community @xmath114 in scheme @xmath106 and to community @xmath115 in scheme @xmath107 is proportional to the corresponding element @xmath116 of the confusion matrix , so that @xmath117 using the probability as defined in , we can calculate the normalized mutual information as @xmath118 is expressed in terms of the usual mutual information @xmath119 and entropies @xmath120 and @xmath120 @xcite , defined as @xmath121 in , we have made use of the common shorthand abbreviations @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 . the base of the logarithms in is arbitrary , as the computed measures only appear in the ratio in .",
    "the normalized mutual information is a measure of the amount of information common to the two partitioning schemes . by taking one of the partitions to be the assumed modular structure of the network and one to be the structure found using the brimalgorithm",
    ", we can thus explore the efficacy of the algorithm . when the found modules match the real ones , we have @xmath125 , and when the found modules are independent of the real ones , we have @xmath126 .",
    "we now set @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 , giving @xmath130 vertices in the network . with various choices of @xmath100 and @xmath101 , we repeatedly instantiate the model network and determine the assignment of vertices to modules using the brimalgorithm",
    ". the algorithm is initialized by assigning each of the blue vertices to a unique module . for each sample , we calculate @xmath105 .    in , we show results of applying the brimalgorithm to the model network .",
    "the points show the mean value of @xmath105 , averaged over 100 instantiations of the network .",
    "the error bars show the standard error of the mean .",
    "the general behavior is as anticipated , lending confidence to the algorithm definition .",
    "the brimalgorithm is silent on the issue of how many modules should be used .",
    "as noted in , the number of modules @xmath15 is at most one more than the rank of @xmath72 , which is a relatively weak constraint .",
    "one approach is thus to assign each vertex of the smaller of the red and blue vertex sets to unique modules , and allow the vertices to be grouped into an appropriate number of modules . for the brimalgorithm , said approach is resource intensive , requiring the calculation of modularity contributions for what may be a grossly overestimated number of modules .",
    "worse still , when the number of vertices is much greater than the number of modules , the brimalgorithm may terminate at low - quality local maxima far from the true number of modules in the network ( see for an example of this ) .    clearly , automatically selecting the correct number of allowed modules in such a case would be preferable .",
    "the allowed number of modules @xmath15 thus becomes an adaptable parameter for which a value is to be found that optimizes the modularity .",
    "this presents some difficulties in that there is no obvious relationship between the allowed number of modules and the modularity found by the brimalgorithm .",
    "however , by assuming that the modularity depends on the allowed number of modules in a reasonably smooth fashion , we can use a simple bisection approach to identify an appropriate value for the number of allowed modules .",
    "the search begins by requiring all vertices to belong to the same module , @xmath131 , giving @xmath34 .",
    "we double the allowed number of modules @xmath15 .",
    "half of the vertices are randomly reassigned to the newly defined modules , and a new , locally optimal solution is found using the brimalgorithm .",
    "this process continues , with @xmath15 being repeatedly doubled so long as @xmath6 continues to increase .",
    "each step in the @xmath15-search builds on the previous solution by partially reusing the assignment of vertices to modules .",
    "once @xmath6 drops as @xmath15 increases , we have crossed a maximum in the modularity landscape .",
    "we therefore switch from extrapolating to larger numbers of modules to interpolating within the interval that includes the maximum .",
    "the interpolation is done using a simple bisection search in the allowed number of modules , trying new values for @xmath15 so as to continuously reduce the interval wherein the putative maximum in @xmath6 lies . as with the initial extrapolation stage of the search ,",
    "vertices are assigned from earlier solutions to the newly allowed modules for each value of @xmath15 , and a new , locally optimal solution found .",
    "the search for @xmath15 terminates once the interval becomes sufficiently small . in this work",
    ", we take the interval to be 2 , i.e. , the @xmath6 maximum at @xmath132 is bracketed by inferior solutions at @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "this adaptive brimalgorithm enables us to identify the appropriate number of modules @xmath135 in a number of steps that scales logarithmically with the number of vertices in the network .",
    "in this section , we apply the brimalgorithm to a network showing the interactions of women in the american deep south at various social events @xcite and to a network showing corporate interlocks in scottish firms @xcite . both networks are conveniently available on the world wide web in pajek format @xcite .      as an initial example",
    ", we consider the southern women data set , collected by @xcite in and around natchez , mississippi during the 1930s as part of an extensive study of class and race in the deep south .",
    "this data set and networks derived from it have been much studied .",
    "indeed , @xcite has described it as ``  a touchstone for comparing analytic methods in social network analysis . ''",
    "the southern women data set describes the participation of 18 women in 14 social events .",
    "the women and social events constitute a bipartite network ; an edge exists between a woman and a social event if the woman was in attendance at the event . the network is connected .",
    "we identified network modular structure using the brimalgorithm .",
    "the initial state is in general important .",
    "the dependence on the initial state is most visible in the quality of the stable solution , i.e. , the algorithm can get `` stuck '' at a poor quality local maximum .",
    "we initialized the assignment of events to modules in @xmath76 using several strategies : ( 1 ) assigning all events to a single module , ( 2 ) assigning each event to its own module , and ( 3 ) randomly assigning events to modules .    for this network ,",
    "all three strategies identify modular structures .",
    "the first strategy produces a good quality solution ( 4 modules , @xmath136 ) .",
    "the second strategy also produces a solution that captures a great deal of the modular structure , but is somewhat coarser than the first ( 2 modules , @xmath137 ) .",
    "the third strategy , random initial assignment , sheds light on the quality of the first two .",
    "because the network is small , a large number of trials can be run without difficulty ; we ran 500,000 trials .",
    "the greatest modularity found equalled that found with all events initially in unique modules , @xmath136 , indicating that this best solution found is quite good .    in",
    ", we show the best assignment of vertices to modules determined using the brimalgorithm with all events initially in different modules .",
    "the shapes of the vertices show which ones belong to the same modules , with four modules in all .",
    "open symbols with black labels portray vertices corresponding to the women , and filled symbols with white labels portray vertices corresponding to the events .",
    "the positions of the vertices are based on the singular vectors corresponding to the two largest singular values of @xmath72 , with the right singular vectors giving the coordinates for the events and the left singular vectors giving the coordinates for the women .",
    "several vertices have been shifted slightly to prevent overlapping vertex symbols while preserving the overall character of the network .    ; some vertices are repositioned slightly to eliminate overlaps .",
    "the vertex partition pictured has the highest modularity we have found for the southern women network , @xmath138    the community groups found using the brimalgorithm are comparable to those found in previous investigations of the southern women data set ( ref .",
    "@xcite provides a useful survey ) .",
    "most such studies have focused on the women , leaving the groupings for the events unspecified ; we can use the groupings of the women to assign the events to the best modules , as described in , and calculate modularity values for purposes of comparison .",
    "the community groups can be further compared using the normalized mutual information between the various groupings of the women and the best grouping found using the brimalgorithm .",
    "values of @xmath139 and @xmath105 are summarized in and discussed in depth below .",
    "ldd modules & & + brim & 0.34554 & 1 + spectral & 0.32117 & 0.56897 + davis 1 & 0.31057 & 0.44657 + davis 2 & 0.31839 & 0.45126 + doreian & 0.29390 & 0.60766 + unipartite & 0.21866 & 0.28019 +    in the original investigation , @xcite used general ethnographic knowledge of the community to assign the women to two groups .",
    "the groups consisted of women 19 and of women 918 ; woman 9 is a secondary member of both groups . to be consistent with the definitions in",
    ", we must assign this individual to a specific group .",
    "the @xmath139 and @xmath105 values are seen from to be similar for both assignments , with the case where woman 9 is grouped with women 1018 labeled as `` davis 1 '' and the case where woman 9 is grouped with women 18 labeled as `` davis 2 . ''",
    "the latter division is the same as what @xcite identified as the consensus from 21 different studies of the southern women data set .",
    "the @xmath139 and @xmath105 values are reasonably similar to values found for two modules using either the brimalgorithm or spectral bipartitioning as discussed in , which groups the women into sets \\{17 , 9 } and \\{8 , 1018 } ( identified in with the label `` spectral '' ) .",
    "@xcite considered the modular nature of both parts of the network , suggesting several divisions of the women and events .",
    "the division with the greatest modularity ( given in their table 4 ) is characterized in with the label `` doreian . '' taking just their partitioning of the events into three groups ( events 15 , 69 , and 1014 ) and replacing their partitioning of the women using the approach from , the modularity can be increased from 0.29390 to 0.32950 .",
    "this is similar to the best assignment of vertices to modules we described above , with modularity of 0.34554 , wherein the additional structure produces a modest , but real , improvement in the modularity .",
    "it is also of interest to compare the community groups obtained for the southern women network using the bipartite network to those found using an unweighted projection network .",
    "here , we focus on the projection consisting of the eighteen women as vertices , with edges defined by mutual participation in events .",
    "the best division we found for the women , discussed above and shown in , actually has a negative value for the standard unipartite modularity ; it is thus better to use only a single module containing all eighteen women than the best module found for the bipartite network .",
    "since the modules we identified from the bipartite network using the brimalgorithm are similar to those found in numerous other studies , this highlights the difficulties that can arise using a unipartite projection .",
    "conversely , we can determine the bipartite modularity for community groups found using the unipartite projection .",
    "we first use the newman vector to partition the women into two groups as described in , with women 2 and 47 in one group and all others in a second group .",
    "next , we determine the best assignment of events to modules using the approach from . together",
    ", this gives the values shown in for the label `` unipartite , '' which reflect that some of the modular structure of the network has been captured but is generally inferior to the solutions found from the bipartite network .",
    "further , the solution from the unweighted projection does not correspond to a maximum in the bipartite modularity ; using the solution as the initial state for the brimalgorithm , a solution is obtained with two modules identical to those found using spectral bipartitioning as described in .      as a second example",
    ", we consider a data set on corporate interlocks in scotland in the early twentieth century @xcite .",
    "the data set characterizes 108 scottish firms during 1904 - 5 , detailing the corporate sector , capital , and board of directors for each firm . the data set includes only those board members who held multiple directorships , totaling 136 individuals .    here , we focus on the bipartite network of firms and directors , with edges existing between each firm and its board members . unlike the southern women network",
    ", the scotland corporate interlock network is not connected . in the following ,",
    "we consider only the largest component of the graph , containing 131 directors and 86 firms  and thus , as many as 86 modules .    as with the southern women network , assigning all directors to unique modules or to the same module results in a solution that captures some of the modular character of the network , with @xmath140 and @xmath141 , respectively .",
    "however , in contrast to the southern women network , these are rather poor solutions to what can be found starting from a random assignment of directors to modules ( see ) .",
    "further , the best solutions are found by restricting the allowed number of modules @xmath15 to less than the maximum . in principle , allowing the number of modules to take on any size leaves the brimalgorithm to search the largest possible space , potentially finding the largest possible modularity value . in practice ,",
    "the results are inferior to those obtained from a more restricted search . in",
    ", we show the results , in terms of the actual numbers of modules occupied and modularity values , for brimsearches with the allowed number of modules restricted .",
    "this trades off the possibility of higher modularity values in the excluded region for improved searching in the remaining region .",
    "the trade - off is clearly a good one , as the best solutions are found with fewer than thirty modules .    in",
    ", we also show three runs of the adaptive brimalgorithm described in .",
    "the lines show the progress of the number of modules and modularity value during the search .",
    "the number of modules @xmath15 allowed for the brimsearch is typically close ( within 10% ) to the number of modules actually found , suggesting that the adaptive approach eliminates a wasteful search through vertex assignments with too many modules .",
    "the three traces all show typical behavior and lead to good solutions ; two of the adaptive runs lead to better solutions , in terms of modularity , than any of the much larger number of trials using brimwith a fixed @xmath15 .",
    "depends on the allowed number of modules @xmath15 .",
    "the points correspond to solutions found using the brimalgorithm starting from a random initial assignment of vertices to modules .",
    "the values on the ordinate indicate the number of modules occupied by at least one vertex in the solution state found by the brimalgorithm .",
    "all points are slightly dithered to better show regions with many similar or identical solutions .",
    "the lines show the course of an adaptive search for the correct number of modules to maximize the modularity , terminating at states with the modularity and number of modules shown by the crosses . ]",
    "based on the solutions shown in , the main component of the scotland corporate interlock network has roughly twenty community groups , considerably fewer than the 131 directors or 86 firms .",
    "this analysis could serve as a starting point for an investigation of the community structures of the firms or directors .",
    "a more comprehensive analysis would take into account the available information on the corporate sectors and capital of the firms .",
    "we have defined and explored a modularity appropriate for bipartite networks .",
    "the presented results extend and specialize the matrix - based approach recently reported by @xcite for unipartite networks . the bipartite structure of the network is reflected mathematically in the importance of an asymmetric submatrix @xmath72 of the full bipartite modularity matrix @xmath0 , with a corresponding emphasis on the singular value decomposition of @xmath72 instead of the spectral decomposition of @xmath0 .",
    "we made use of the properties of @xmath72 to define an algorithm , brim , for use in identifying network modules . by applying the algorithm to real - world networks",
    ", we demonstrated its effectiveness and identified some of its limitations .",
    "the usual unipartite modularity has a limited resolution that depends on the number of edges in the network @xcite .",
    "the main consequence of the resolution limit is that the modules in large networks may have hidden substructures that require deeper investigations to reveal .",
    "although we have not shown it , we expect that the bipartite modularity introduced in this work has a similar resolution limit , with similar consequences .",
    "one of the key themes in this paper has been that the bipartite structure of the network can be beneficially incorporated into its mathematical description and its computational treatment .",
    "this theme was realized in the brimalgorithm , where the assignment of vertices to modules in one part of the network , when held fixed , provides a stable modularity landscape in which it is straightforward to partition the vertices of the other part into modules .",
    "we expect that the characteristics of other specialized classes of networks could be taken advantage of in an analogous fashion to define appropriate null model networks , modularity measures , and community detection algorithms .",
    "the eigenvalues of the graph laplacian are closely related to many important properties and invariants of the graph @xcite . in contrast , relatively little is known about the spectra of modularity matrices , be they for unipartite or bipartite networks .",
    "we are optimistic that the eigenvalues of the modularity matrix usefully relate to important and interesting network properties .",
