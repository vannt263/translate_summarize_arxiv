    "non - perturbative scheme of the flow equation method introduced by f.  wegner @xcite and independently by k.  wilson with s.  gazek @xcite proved to be a useful tool for investigating a number of problems in the condensed matter physics @xcite , mesoscopic systems @xcite , quantum optics @xcite and quantum chromodynamics @xcite .",
    "this procedure has been also recently applied to study the non - equilibrium transport phenomena of the correlated nanoscopic systems @xcite .",
    "the main idea is rather simple and relies on a continuous process which , step by step , transforms the hamiltonian to a diagonal or at least block - diagonal structure .",
    "one can use for this purpose various operators , depending on the subtleties of the discussed problem @xcite .",
    "such continuous diagonalization scheme is reminiscent of the renormalization group ( rg ) technique @xcite .",
    "they are similar with regard to the treatment of high / low energy states ( fast / slow modes ) . in initial steps of the continuous transformation procedure mainly the most off - diagonal terms ( i.e.  high energy sector )",
    "are dealt with .",
    "subsequently , the remaining parts closer to the diagonal are transformed . since",
    "different energy scales are successively transformed / renormalized one by one the algorithm of flow equation method is relative to the family of rg formulations @xcite .",
    "let us remark that such techniques are in principle unrestricted by limitations of the usual perturbative methods .    in this paper",
    "we : ( 1 ) formulate the current - current response function for the superconducting system using the flow equation method , and ( 2 ) extend such scheme to a state of the preformed pairs which above the critical temperature @xmath0 loose the long - range coherence .",
    "our study is motivated by the recent torque magnetometry data of the princeton group @xcite revealing the diamagnetic features well preserved above @xmath0 in the lanthanum and yttrium cuprate oxides .",
    "similar indications have been also reported from the @xmath1 susceptibility measurements for bi@xmath2sr@xmath3ca@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6 @xcite and from the high - resolution squid data for sm - based underdoped ybco compounds @xcite .",
    "since the observed diamagnetic response is rather strong it can be hardly assigned to the ginzburg - landau fluctuations @xcite .",
    "adopting argumentation discussed in the literature on the microscopic @xcite and the phenomenological grounds @xcite we consider the system consisting of the preformed local pairs ( of arbitrary origin ) coexisting and interacting with the itinerant electrons . using the flow equation approach",
    "we analyze the diamagnetism within such scenario .",
    "our study can be regarded as complementary to the recent quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations for the same cooperon - fermion model @xcite .",
    "it has also some resemblance to considerations of the superconducting fluctuations beyond the gaussian approximation carried out in the t - j model @xcite .",
    "we start by discussing the usual bcs model , treating it as a testing field for formulation of the linear response theory in terms of the flow equation method ( readers less interested in the methodological details can skip this section ) .",
    "we next apply the same treatment to the mixture of electrons interacting through the andreev scattering with the preformed local pairs .",
    "we determine the current - current response function and try to asses the diamagnetic response above @xmath0 . in summary , we point out the main conclusions and give a list of problems which might be of interest for further studies .",
    "let us first briefly illustrate how the flow equation procedure determines the quasiparticle spectrum and the corresponding response function for the usual bcs model @xmath7 describing electrons coupled to the pairing field @xmath8 .",

    "<S> we apply the flow equation method for studying the current - current response function of electron systems with the pairing instability . to illustrate the specific scheme in which the flow equation procedure determines the two - particle green s functions we reproduce the standard response kernel of the bcs superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> we next generalize this non - perturbative treatment considering the pairing field fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> our study indicates that the residual diamagnetic behavior detected above the transition temperature in the cuprate superconductors can originate from the noncondensed preformed pairs . </S>"
