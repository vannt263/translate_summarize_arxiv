    "after one year of successful operation integral has gathered a large amount of scientific data .",
    "deeper performance verification , based on comparison of the scientific results obtained from the individual integral instruments and from other missions , now becomes crucial .",
    "this poster summarizes the current status of the cross - calibration with respect to spectral shape studies .",
    "the calibration issues should be studied for a bright , steady x - ray source with a rather simple , well established spectral model . below",
    "we present the comparison of integral crab spectra with the canonical model of the crab nebula : an absorbed power law , with spectral index , @xmath0 = 2.1 , and with a normalization at 1 kev , @xmath1 = 9.7 photons @xmath2",
    "s@xmath3 kev@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the absorption hydrogen column density , @xmath4 = @xmath5 @xmath2 , was adopted from the current xmm - newton measurements @xcite .",
    "spectral modelling was done using xspec 11.3 @xcite .",
    "1 shows the ratios between the integral crab data and the canonical model .",
    "spectra from revolution 102 ( 15 - 17 august 2003 ) were extracted with the osa 3.0 software .",
    "for all instruments the absolute normalization is still not perfect .",
    "the result for jem - x 2 is not satisfying below 7 kev .",
    "this is due to an incorrect flux reconstruction for lower energies and makes the spectra appear more absorbed than they actually are .",
    "the isgri case is the worst , with the spectrum being distorted by snake - like features below @xmath6100 kev and with declining flux above 200 kev .",
    "the spi spectrum , except for normalization , agrees well with the model , being quite smooth in the 30 - 200 kev range .    ]",
    "fixing the canonical model parameters we have fitted the relative normalization parameters for the integral instruments .",
    "( jem - x 2 spectra are always fitted in the 7 - 21 kev range in the following , while the energy range used in fitting for isgri and spi is that shown in figures . )",
    "the fit is bad and releasing the power law index does not improve it . for individual instruments we obtain almost acceptable fits for jem - x 2 and spi , but with a model which is a little too flat in the jem - x 2 case .",
    "the isgri model gives a slope equal to the canonical value but the fit is poor .",
    "all these results are listed in table 1 . during fitting",
    "we have applied only statistical errors , except for isgri , for which we have tested an alternative fit , after adding systematical errors of 10% to the data .",
    "this leads to an acceptable @xmath7 and a quite good absolute normalization but with a larger slope .",
    "it should be mentioned that the isgri spectra shown here were extracted for science windows with the source being on axis .",
    "selecting data with the object in the fully coded field of view gives a worse , lower normalization , about 50% of that obtained for on - axis spectra .    in fig .",
    "2 we present the comparison between the crab spectra extracted with the osa 3.0 and osa 2.0 packages .",
    "the data for spi are not shown , since for spi there was no change in the software affecting the calibration in these two osa releases .",
    "both jem - x 2 and isgri data from osa 2.0 are farther from the proper absolute normalization . however , with osa 3.0 the absorption feature mentioned above arises for jem - x 2 . the scattering of the isgri flux is suppressed for osa 3.0 in comparison to osa 2.0 but the overall spectral shape remains bad",
    ". please note the good agreement between the absolute jem - x 2 and isgri fluxes at 20 kev with osa 3.0    ]    .results of spectral fitting obtained for crab spectra from integral revolution 102 .",
    "c values are the relative normalization factors , a and @xmath0 are parameters of the power law model .",
    "the second fit for isgri was done after adding systematic errors of 10% to the data .",
    "fixed parameters are denoted with f. [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : weaktable ]",
    "integral spectra extracted currently should be treated with caution . at the present time none of the integral instruments can be used to measure the absolute flux .",
    "the major problem of jem - x 2 with respect to the spectral shape is the artificial absorption excess observed below 7 kev .",
    "the response matrices for isgri are still preliminary and the spectra are too deformed to be used for detailed spectral modeling .",
    "only spi does not exhibit any serious problems in its spectral shape calibration .",
    "the calibration of the integral instruments is in progress , the new major release 4.0 of osa should solve many of the issues discussed here ."
