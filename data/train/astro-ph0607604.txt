    "observations of high redshift supenovae @xcite , temperature anisotropies of the cosmic background radiation @xcite , matter power spectrum @xcite , and the integrated sachs  wolfe signal @xcite indicate that the universe is currently undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "a cosmological constant , @xmath2 , is frequently invoked as the most natural candidate to drive this acceleration . however",
    ", this choice is rather problematic .",
    "first , the observed @xmath2 value falls by many orders of magnitude below the prediction of quantum field theories @xcite .",
    "second , it is hard to understand why precisely today the vacuum energy density is of the same order of magnitude than that of matter .",
    "this remarkable fact , known as the `` coincidence problem '' @xcite , lacks of a fully convincing theoretical explanation .",
    "models based on at least two matter components ( baryonic and dark ) and one dark energy component ( with a high negative pressure ) have been suggested to explain the accelerated rate of expansion and simultaneously alleviate the coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "further , coupling between dark matter ( dm ) and dark energy ( de ) has been suggested as a possible explanation for the coincidence problem @xcite . in particular , the interacting quintessence models of references @xcite , require the ratio of matter and dark energy densities to be constant at late times .",
    "the coupling between matter and quintessence is either motivated by high energy particle physics considerations @xcite or is constructed by requiring the final matter to dark energy ratio to be stable against perturbations @xcite .",
    "the nature of both dm and de being unknown , there is no physical argument to exclude their interaction . on the contrary , arguments in favor of such interaction",
    "have been suggested @xcite , and more recently they have been extended to include neutrinos @xcite . as a result of the interaction ,",
    "the matter density drops with the scale factor @xmath3 of the friedmann ",
    "walker metric more slowly than @xmath4 .",
    "the interacting quintessence model studied in the literature have been found to agree with observations of wmap data and supernovae @xcite , but they require values of cosmological parameters different from those of wmap ( first year ) concordance model .",
    "observations of the large scale structure can also be used to constrain models .",
    "recent data includes the sdss @xcite and 2dfgrs @xcite measurements of the matter power spectrum .",
    "the analysis of 2dfgrs showed discrepancies with wmap first year data but is in much closer agreement than sdss with the results of wmap third year data @xcite .    currently , there is no compelling evidence for dm  de interaction @xcite and its ( non-)existence must be decided observationally .",
    "it has been suggested that the skewness of the large scale matter distribution is a sensitive parameter to determine the difference in the clustering of baryons and dark matter resulting from the interaction @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall study the effect of the interaction on the evolution of matter density perturbations during the radiation dominated period .",
    "the evolution of matter and radiation density perturbations provides powerful tools to constrain the physics of the dark sector @xcite .",
    "we will show how the shape of the matter power spectrum can be a directly related with the interaction and we will use the matter power spectrum measured by the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs , for short ) to set constraints on the interaction .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section ii , we present a brief summary of the interacting quintessence model ( iqm , hereafter ) . in section iii",
    "we describe the evolution of matter and radiation perturbations in models with dark matter and dark energy . in section",
    "iv we discuss some analytical solutions and in section v we show how the slope of a scale invariant matter density perturbations has less power on small scales than non - interacting models . in section",
    "vi we describe the results of monte carlo markov chains constructed to compare the model with the observations . finally , section vii summarizes our main results and conclusions .",
    "most cosmological models implicitly assume that matter and dark energy interact only gravitationally . in the absence of an underlying symmetry that would suppress a matter  dark energy coupling ( or interaction )",
    "there is no a priori reason for dismissing it .",
    "cosmological models in which dark energy and matter do not evolve separately but interact with one another were first introduced to justify the small value of the cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "recently , various proposals at the fundamental level , including field lagrangians , have been advanced to account for the coupling @xcite .",
    "scalar field lagrangians coupled to matter generically do not generate scaling solutions with a long enough dark matter dominated period as required by structure formation @xcite .",

    "we have shown that the interaction induces measurable effects in the growth of the matter density perturbations and modifies the power spectrum on small scales . to summarize , if dark energy decays into dark matter the background model has less dark matter and more dark energy in the past compared to non - decaying models .",
    "since the dark energy does not cluster on small scales it does not contribute to the growth of density perturbations .",
    "the mean free  fall time increases and perturbations grow slower than in non - interacting models .",
    "the slower growth of matter density perturbations during the radiation and matter period , results on a damping of the matter power spectrum on those scales that cross the horizon before matter - radiation equality , but it does not change the slope on large scales .    the combined effect of shifting the scale of matter radiation equality and changing the slope of matter power spectrum at small scales is a distinctive feature of interacting models where the dark energy does not cluster on small scales",
    ". measurements of matter power spectrum could eventually reach enough statistical power to discriminate between interacting and non - interacting models .",
    "for example , the spectrum obtained from lymann-@xmath91 absorption lines on quasar spectra @xcite probe the matter power spectrum at redshifts in the interval @xmath171 , where non - linear evolution has not yet erased the primordial information down to megaparsec scale .",
    "the use of more precise information on small and large scales , could set tighter bounds on the interaction of dark matter and dark energy .",
    "our previous results @xcite and those presented here indicate that the iqm fits the observational data as well as non - interacting models , alleviates the coincidence problem and provides a unified picture of dark matter and dark energy .",
    "it predicts a damping on the matter power spectrum on small scales that can be used , together with the delay on the matter - radiation equality , to discriminate it from non - interacting models",
    ". the slower growth of subhorizon sized matter density perturbations within the horizon provides a clean observational test to proof or rule out a dm  de coupling .",
