    "in addition to a wealth of possible quantum phases  @xcite , and due to its discrete nature , optical lattices offer as well novel possibilities for composite formation , including local on - site dimer ( or @xmath1-mer ) formation in attractive gases  @xcite and fermionic composites in bose - fermi mixtures  @xcite .",
    "an even more striking effect of the lattice discreteness is given by the recent observation of repulsively bound atomic pairs ( doublons ) at a given lattice site  @xcite , which are dynamically stable in the absence of dissipation .",

    "we consider spin-@xmath0 fermions ( @xmath8 ) in a deep 1d lattice , such that at low filling only the lowest band is relevant . in this regime ,",
    "the physics is given by the interplay between inter - site hopping ( characterized by the constant @xmath9 ) , qze ( given by a constant @xmath10 , which may be externally controllable ) , and @xmath11-wave collisions .",

    "a single spin - flip into @xmath5 is not accompanied by spin - changing , and hence lead to isolated @xmath33 excitons which hop with an effective hopping @xmath7 .",

    "as shown below , contrary to the naive expectation , the @xmath0 excitons may become very robust .",
    "we introduce the fourier transformed states  @xcite @xmath49 and @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the number of sites and @xmath45 the center of mass quasi - momentum either of the @xmath0 exciton or of the @xmath33 biexciton .",

    "the mixing angle @xmath81 fulfills @xmath82 the contribution of the @xmath0 exciton to the bound states ( @xmath83 ) is particularly important to understand the dynamics following a spin - flip into @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , at @xmath77 ( when the center of mass of the spin - flip excitation is maximally delocalized ) , @xmath84 and hence the upper bound state is a pure antisymmetric @xmath33 biexciton with @xmath85 and @xmath86 , whereas the lower bound state is a pure @xmath4 exciton with energy @xmath87 . on the contrary , when the center of mass of the spin - flip excitation is strongly localized there is a strong coupling between the exciton and the antisymmetric biexciton which leads to a strongly distorted dynamics , as shown below .     of the @xmath0 exciton wavepacket for @xmath80 , @xmath65 and @xmath88 with  ( dotted ) and without  ( solid ) spin - changing collisions , for an initial gaussian wavepacket with a width of @xmath89 sites.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]",
    "if the initial spin - flip is delocalized in a spatial region much larger than the inter - site spacing the momentum distribution is strongly peaked at @xmath77 .",
    "hence after the spin - flip there is no significant transfer into @xmath33 biexcitons , since the lower bound state is basically a @xmath0 exciton . without spin - changing the exciton tunnels with hopping @xmath30 , and",
    "hence at @xmath77 the effective exciton mass is @xmath90 . in spite of the absence of any significant biexciton admixture , spin - changing strongly modifies the effective exciton mass into : @xmath91 note that @xmath92 differs significantly from @xmath93 ( it may even invert its sign ) , radically modifying the exciton wavepacket dynamics , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "note that if the created initial exciton has a sharply defined but finite center - of - mass momentum @xmath94 , then the @xmath0 exciton is not any more a single bound state but a linear superposition of both bound states ( and possibly a slight contribution of broken biexcitons ) . since the bound states have different group velocities of opposite sign , the dynamics after the spin - flip is hence characterized by the appearance of two wavepackets moving in opposite directions formed by the two different types of exciton - biexciton composites ( fig .",

    "the situation is markedly different if the initial spin - flip is strongly localized , where all @xmath45 in the brillouin zone contribute . as a consequence , the initial @xmath0 excitation results in an admixture of both bound states , which result , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ( bottom ) , to a completely different wavepacket dynamics as that for initially extended spin - flips  ( fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , top ) .",
    "note that , in addition , a localized initial spin - flip may become considerably more unstable against unbinding , especially if the upper antisymmetric-@xmath0 bound state unbinds for a given range of @xmath45 values . in that case",
    "a significant part of the initial exciton excitation would dissolve into unbound biexciton pairs .",
    "up to this point we have considered the dynamics after single spin - flips .",
    "although single spin flips may be created using state of the art techniques for single - site addressing  @xcite , in typical experiments more than one spin - flip will be induced . as a result more than one",
    "composite will be simultaneously created , hence opening the possibility of inelastic composite - composite collisions which may induce a decay channel for the bound composites into broken biexciton pairs .",
    "the various initial spin - flip excitations result in a complicated many - body non - equilibrium dynamics for the created bound composites , which we have studied by means of time - dependent matrix - product - state calculations  @xcite for up to @xmath97 spin - flips delocalized in an initial extension of @xmath89 sites ( for a total of @xmath98 sites ) .",

    "the bound states are well below the sea of broken pairs .",
    "hence , as discussed above , it is expected that single spin - flip excitations do not lead to a significant population of unbound solutions .",
    "two main features can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] . on one side ,",
    "there are marked rabi like oscillations of the @xmath0-exciton population due to the presence of the two bound states .",
    "the oscillation amplitude is small since , as discussed in the previous section , the lowest bound state is to a large extent the @xmath0-exciton due to the initial delocalization of the spin - flip .",
    "note that the rabi oscillations are however damped due to dephasing , since different momentum components close to @xmath95 have a slightly different rabi frequency .",
    "note that a more localized initial spin - flip would result in a stronger frequency beating , due to the participation of momenta over all the brillouin zone .",
    "note also that the presence of additional spin - flips leads to an even stronger damping of the rabi oscillations .    on the other side ,",
    "note that composite - composite collisions basically leave unaffected the total population in the bound states , which for this particular case basically reduces to the population of @xmath0 excitons  ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1]a ) and unbroken @xmath33 biexcitons  ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1]b ) .",
    "hence , deeply bound states may be created , which do not undergo significant inelastic unbinding due to inelastic collisions .",
    "thus , multiple spin - flips lead to an out - of - equilibrium ( but highly metastable ) many - body state , which may understood as a basically stable gas of bound composites , opening interesting perspectives for quantum composite gases . for the particular case considered in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] we expect a quantum gas of almost pure @xmath0-excitons with `` biexciton dressed '' dynamics .",
    "note that although the @xmath0-excitons present an effective attractive nearest neighbor interaction ( @xmath102 ) , this interaction becomes irrelevant at low momenta @xmath103 compared to the infinite on - site repulsion due to pauli exclusion .",
    "hence the low @xmath45 properties of 1d @xmath0 excitons will be as those of a tonks - girardeau gas .",
    "in summary , spin flips in a polarized repulsive high - spin fermi gas may lead to the formation of novel types of bound composites , which we illustrated for the case of 1d spin-@xmath0 hard - core fermions in the mott phase . in that case",
    "the composites are formed by a @xmath0 exciton - like excitation and an antisymmetric @xmath33 biexciton - like one .",
    "intriguing dynamics and stability properties of the composites result from a non trivial interplay between spin - changing , qze and exciton momentum .",
