    "when an impurity is introduced into a low dimensional structure , such as quantum wells ( qw ) , nano wires ( nw ) and quantum dots ( qd ) the calculation of the electronic properties in this structures becomes considerably more complex if compared to that of a doped three - dimensional crystal @xcite .",
    "this occurs because of the restricted movement in the structure growth direction , which is imposed by the potential due to band edges discontinuities @xmath1 .",
    "first , the binding energy of the carrier - impurity in the structure depends on the confinement potential @xmath1 , and second , both the binding energy and wave function of the carrier and impurity depends on the impurity position in the structure growth direction . on the other hand , due to recent progress in epitaxial crystal growth techniques , such as molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) , research focusing on impurity and electronic states in nano - structures",
    "has attracted great attention @xcite .",
    "however , effects caused by image charges due to the dielectric mismatch at the structure interface have been overlooked .",
    "indeed , donor binding energy can be significantly modified by additional confinement effects that image charges distribution produce @xcite .",
    "thus , recent research focusing on high - k dielectrics based qws and nws reveals interesting results related to carrier confinement @xcite .",
    "we recently demonstrate that the interaction between carriers and their image charge , induced by the dielectric mismatch ( @xmath2 = 9.5 / 25 = 0.38 ) , strongly modifies the electronic structure in gan / hfo@xmath0 qws ( and nws ) and for wide qws ( wide radii nws ) heavy holes are confined in interfacial regions , similar to that observed in type - ii heterostructures @xcite .",
    "such interfacial confinement leads to drastic modications on the electronic properties of the qws and nws .",
    "particularly , for nws under an applied magnetic field , where angular momentum transitions occur in the ground state due to the aharonov - bohr effect @xcite . a decrease in the oscillator strength of electron - hole pairs in @xmath3 qws and nws",
    "is also predicted for wide qw and larger wire radii , which directly affects their recombination rates @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate electron - impurity binding energy in gan / hfo@xmath0 qws . as for illustration",
    "we compared this results with those of a more typical aln / gan system .",
    "the presence of a point charge in a region where the dielectric constant is discontinuous induces polarization charges at the qw interfaces , and this problem can be solved by the image charges method @xcite . as shown here , the electron energy , electron wave function and the electron - impurity binding energy can change significantly due to additional confinement effects produced by the image charge distribution .",
    "our calculation considers simultaneously all energy contributions caused by the dielectric mismatch : ( i ) image self - energy ( interaction between electron and its image charges ) , ( ii ) the direct coulomb interaction between electron and the actual impurity , as well as ( iii ) the interactions among electron and impurity image charges .",
    "moreover , from practical means , we also investigate stark effect and electron - impurity binding energy for two different confinement regimes : narrow ( 5 nm ) and wide ( 10 nm ) qws . when compared to the effective bohr s radius for the gan bulk @xmath4 ( @xmath5 nm ; where @xmath6 is the bohr s radius ) narrow and wide qws used in this work",
    "are twice and four times the effective bohr s radius , respectively .",
    "the binding energy of an electron bound to a hydrogenic impurity is obtained as function of the impurity position , by solving a fully three - dimensional time dependent schrdinger equation using a method with neither adjustable parameters nor restrictive basis expansions as employed by almost all theoretical approaches in the literature @xcite . for simplicity ,",
    "we address zinc blende gan instead of its wurtzite crystalline structure in order to avoid more complicated polarizations effects observed in this phase @xcite .",
    "_ 1 . time - dependent schrdinger equation _",
    "+ the theoretical method used to calculate the binding energy of an electron bound to a hydrogenic impurity is based on the adiabatic approximation .",
    "the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xcite is consistent with the effective mass approach and the envelope function formalism    @xmath7    and describes the quantized states of a single particle coupled to a quantum well under the effect of impurity coulomb potential and potential due to image charges .",

    "the initial solution @xmath12 given by the method is    @xmath13    the hamiltonian of equation  ( [ eq2 ] ) does not depend on time , so the integral in equation  ( [ eq3 ] ) , solved in the range between @xmath14 and @xmath15 is given by    @xmath16        which is approximated by the expression    @xmath17}}\\ ] ]    @xmath18}}\\ ] ] @xmath19}}+o \\left ( \\delta t^3 \\right).\\ ] ]    the error introduced in this expression , when we drop the term @xmath20 , results from the noncommutability of the kinetic and potential operators . the potential operator @xmath21 , with @xmath22 and @xmath23 , is given by    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the heterostructure band edge confinement , @xmath26 is the self - energy potential and @xmath27 is the direct electron - impurity coulomb interaction .",
    "the last term includes direct eletron - impurity coulomb interaction and the interactions between electron and impurity image charges . this contribution to the total potential",
    "was deduced from solutions of the poisson equation in 2d quantum structures , as shown in eqs .",

    "the coulomb potential becomes more attractive in gan / hfo@xmath0 .",

    "[ fig3](c ) and ( d ) . aside from this difference",
    "this energy is essentially due to the band offset and the self energy potential , as it is shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "further more , as the impurity position @xmath84 increase to the barrier region , the stationary states inside the well tends to discrete states analogous to the case of a quantum well without impurity , as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and ( b ) for @xmath96 5 nm . in the binding energy @xmath97 both contribution band offset and self energy potentials are not take into account and the states collapse near to @xmath98 10 nm , as shown in fig .",

    "this difference increase asymptotically until reach the maximum value around the interface position and decrease toward negative values in narrow quantum wells due to the attractive character of the self energy in systems with @xmath99 , as it can see on the reference @xcite and @xcite .",

    "in conclusion , we have studied impurity state with image charges effects in gan / hfo@xmath0 quantum wells .",
    "our results show that the electron - impurity binding energy is highest when the impurity is located at the center of the quantum well and decreases when the impurity moves towards the interface .",
    "when the impurity is located on the barrier region the binding energy has a smaller intensity .",
    "moreover , when a electric field is applied on @xmath59 direction the electron energy can be shifted by about 50 mev in wide quantum wells .",
