    "in the following presentation , our interest is devoted to the low - temperature behavior of ferromagnets , which exhibit a spontaneously broken internal symmetry o(3 ) @xmath0 o(2 ) .",
    "this system has been widely studied in condensed matter physics and it is not our intention to contribute to its detailed microscopic understanding .",
    "rather , we want to analyze several low - energy phenomena from a unified point of view , relying on the method of nonrelativistic effective lagrangians .",
    "we try to understand how the symmetries , inherent in the underlying theory , manifest themselves in the partition function at low temperatures .",
    "the complex microscopic description of the system is taken into account only through a phenomenological parametrization , which , in the effective lagrangian , emerges in the form of a few coupling constants .",
    "nevertheless , let us first consider the heisenberg model , which describes the ferromagnet on a _ microscopic _ level .",
    "there , the exchange hamiltonian @xmath3 , @xmath4 formulates the dynamics in terms of spin operators @xmath5 , attached to lattice sites @xmath6 .",
    "note that the summation only extends over nearest neighbors and that the isotropic interaction is assumed to be identical for any two adjacent lattice sites . for positive values of the exchange integral @xmath7",
    ", the above expression leads to an adequate low - energy description of the ferromagnet .",
    "the interaction between a constant magnetic field @xmath8 , and the spin degrees of freedom is taken into account through the zeeman term . in the corresponding extension of the heisenberg model,@xcite",
    "@xmath9 the magnetic field is coupled to the vector of the total spin .    within this model",
    ", dyson evaluated the low - temperature expansion for the partition function of a ferromagnet for all three types of cubic lattices.@xcite in particular , for the most prominent order parameter of the ferromagnet , the spontaneous magnetization , he obtained the following series : @xmath10 the @xmath11-term , referred to as bloch s law , corresponds to free magnons .",
    "the next two terms involving the coefficients @xmath12 and @xmath13 are related to the shape of the dispersion curve  or the discreteness of the lattice  and describe free magnons as well .",
    "remarkably , the spin - wave interaction starts manifesting itself only at order @xmath2 .    in order to obtain this result , dyson had to set up a highly involved mathematical machinery .",
    "it is our goal to rederive this series within the effective lagrangian framework and to understand dyson s result by exclusively considering the symmetries of the theory . in order to do so",
    ", we will first have to establish the momentum power counting scheme for this nonrelativistic system , which represents the very basis for a systematic expansion of quantities of physical interest . as we will see , it is quite different from the power counting scheme in lorentz - invariant effective theories ( chiral perturbation theory ) .    another aspect of the present work concerns the comparison of the low - energy properties of o(3 ) ferromagnets and o(3 ) antiferromagnets . within the framework of nonrelativistic effective lagrangians , we will , e.g. , be able to understand the striking differences in the low - temperature expansions for the order parameters : the spontaneous magnetization for a ferromagnet and the staggered magnetization for an antiferromagnet , respectively .    in the effective lagrangian perspective , the excitations near the ground state , the spin waves or magnons in the present case , are interpreted as goldstone bosons resulting from a spontaneously broken internal symmetry .",
    "indeed , the heisenberg hamiltonian ( [ heisenberg ] ) is invariant under a simultaneous rotation of the spin variables described by the symmetry group g = o(3 ) , whereas the ground state of a ferromagnet breaks this symmetry spontaneously down to h = o(2 ) : all the spins are aligned in one specific direction , giving rise to a nonzero spontaneous magnetization .",
    "whenever a physical system exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking and the corresponding goldstone bosons represent the only low - energy excitations without energy gap , we do have a very powerful means at our disposal to analyze its low - energy structure : effective lagrangians .",
    "the method was originally developed in connection with lorentz - invariant field theories ( chiral perturbation theory),@xcite admitting a low - energy analysis of the strong interaction described by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the effective lagrangian technique has also proven to be very useful in the investigation of other relativistic systems where goldstone bosons occur , see , e.g. , refs.@xcite .",
    "the method has been extended to finite temperature,@xcite allowing for a systematic low - temperature analysis of the partition function .    in condensed matter physics ,",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking is a common phenomenon and effective field theory methods are widely used in this domain .",
    "only recently , however , has chiral perturbation theory been extended to such nonrelativistic systems,@xcite demonstrating its applicability to solid state physics as well .",
    "the method is based on effective lagrangians which exploit the symmetry properties of the underlying theory , i.e. , the heisenberg model in the present case , and permits a systematic low - energy expansion of quantities of physical interest in powers of inverse wavelength .",
    "the few applications related to systems exhibiting collective magnetic behavior that appeared in the literature so far concern spin - wave scattering processes,@xcite spin - wave mediated non - reciprocal effects in antiferromagnets,@xcite the low - temperature expansion of the staggered magnetization of o(n ) antiferromagnets@xcite and spin waves in canted phases.@xcite an interesting application concerning so(5 ) invariance and high-@xmath14 superconductivity can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "pedagogical introductions to effective lagrangians are refs.@xcite , brief outlines of the method can be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "as the effective analysis refers to large wavelengths , it does not resolve the microscopic structure of a solid and the system hence appears homogeneous .",
    "accordingly , the effective lagrangian is invariant with respect to translations . on the other hand ,",
    "the effective lagrangian is not invariant under rotations , since the lattice structure of a solid singles out preferred directions . in the case of a cubic lattice ,",
    "the anisotropy , however , only shows up at higher orders of the derivative expansion:@xcite the discrete symmetries of a cubic lattice thus imply space rotation symmetry . in the following ,",
    "we assume that the ferromagnet exhibits this type of lattice structure : the leading order effective lagrangian is then invariant both under translations and under rotations and the corresponding expression for a ferromagnet takes the form@xcite @xmath15 in the above notation , the two real components of the magnon field , @xmath16 , have been collected in a three - dimensional unit vector @xmath17 , which transforms with the vector representation of the rotation group o(3 ) . at leading order ,",
    "the ferromagnet is thus characterized by two different low energy constants , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . the first term , which involves a time derivative , is related to a topological invariant .",
    "remarkably , due to this contribution proportional to the spontaneous magnetization @xmath18 , the effective lagrangian of a ferromagnet fails to be invariant under the group g = o(3 ) .",
    "note that such expressions , involving order parameters associated with the generators of the spontaneously broken group , would not be permitted in lorentz - invariant effective theories .",
    "it represents the main novelty occurring in condensed matter physics , where nonrelativistic kinematics is less restrictive than lorentz invariance .",
    "the associated equation of motion is the landau - lifshitz equation , @xmath20 which describes the dynamics of ferromagnetic spin waves .",
    "its structure is of the schrdinger type : first order in time , but second order in space .",
    "note that , according to goldstone s theorem , there have to be two real goldstone fields in the case of a spontaneously broken symmetry o(3 ) @xmath0 o(2 ) .",
    "however , in the nonrelativistic regime , this does not necessarily imply that there also have to exist two independent magnon states .",
    "indeed , in the present case of a ferromagnet , a complex field is required to describe one particle : there exists only _",
    "one _ type of spin - wave excitation in a o(3 ) ferromagnet , following a quadratic dispersion relation , @xmath21 accordingly , in the effective description of this nonrelativistic system , * two * powers of momentum correspond to only * one * power of energy or temperature : @xmath22 .",
    "the effective lagrangian method provides us with a simultaneous expansion in powers of momentum and of the external field @xmath23 .",
    "the important point is that , to a given order in the low - energy expansion , only a finite number of coupling constants and a finite number of graphs contribute .",
    "let us now set up the effective lagrangian for a ferromagnet at higher orders in the momentum expansion@xcite and consider the corresponding power counting scheme .",
    "in his pioneering microscopic analysis , dyson evaluated the temperature expansion for the partition function of a cubic ferromagnet up to terms of order @xmath24 . in our effective language ,",
    "where one power of temperature or energy counts like two powers of momentum , this corresponds to an expansion up to order @xmath1 .",
    "we will now show that , to this order in the momenta , contributions to the effective lagrangian involving at most six space derivatives enter and the perturbative expansion requires the evaluation of graphs containing at most two loops .",
    "first of all , note that there are no contributions to the effective lagrangian with an odd number of space derivatives : parity excludes terms like @xmath25 which involve the antisymmetric tensor @xmath26 .    before constructing the relevant pieces @xmath27 step by step",
    ", we have to point out an important assumption underlying the present analysis : we assume that the effective lagrangian of a ferromagnet is gauge invariant at subleading orders . in fact , the discrete symmetries of a cubic lattice and time - reversal invariance ensure that there is no topological contribution in @xmath28 ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "topological contributions which may show up in @xmath29 or beyond do not affect the conclusions of the present work .",
    "gauge invariance then implies that the magnetic field @xmath23 enters the derivative expansion through a timelike covariant derivative , @xmath30 note that the magnetic field occurs on the same level as the time derivative and is thus counted as a quantity of order @xmath31 .",
    "the next - to - leading order lagrangian is of order @xmath32 .",
    "it involves terms with two time derivatives , terms with one time and two space derivatives and terms with four space derivatives .",
    "time derivatives , however , can be eliminated with the equation of motion,@xcite @xmath33 such that we end up with the following independent terms:@xcite @xmath34 we thus have three effective coupling constants , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , at next - to - leading order .",
    "note that all terms involving the magnetic field have been eliminated with the equation of motion .",
    "in particular , gauge invariance implies that there is no tree graph from @xmath37 contributing to the vacuum energy .",
    "clearly , the question now arises , to what order @xmath38 in the effective lagrangian @xmath39 we have to go to evaluate the partition function up to accuracy @xmath1 . in the following",
    ", we will show that loop corrections involving ferromagnetic magnons are suppressed by _ three _ powers of momentum and the effective lagrangian is needed up to @xmath40 .    to verify this statement ,",
    "let us consider a scattering process .",
    "the effective lagrangian provides us with an expansion for a multi - magnon scattering amplitude in powers of momentum .",
    "the elastic magnon - magnon scattering amplitude is obtained by expanding @xmath41 up to order @xmath42 . as shown in figure 1a",
    ", the leading term corresponds to the tree graph involving the four - magnon vertex from @xmath43 and is of order @xmath44 ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the first correction comes from the tree graph 1b with a vertex involving the next - to - leading order lagrangian @xmath37 .",
    "however , we also have to consider loop graphs in the effective framework .",
    "these corrections are in general infinite and need to be renormalized .",
    "= 3.5truecm    consider the magnon - magnon scattering graph 1c , where the two vertices come from @xmath43 .",
    "the form of the loop graph is @xmath45 where the quantities @xmath46 and @xmath47 denote generic energy and three momentum , respectively .",
    "each four - magnon vertex from @xmath43 is of order @xmath48 , while the two magnon propagators are of order @xmath49 . by",
    "dimensional analysis , the loop integral must then have the form @xmath50 comparing this expression with the leading tree graph amplitude 1a , @xmath51 we find the remarkable result that , in the effective description of the ferromagnet , loops are suppressed by * three * powers of momentum .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the lorentz - invariant framework ( chiral perturbation theory ) , where loops are suppressed by two powers of momentum in four dimensions .",
    "hence , in order to carry out the expansion for the partition function up to accuracy @xmath1 , we need the lagrangian up to terms of order @xmath52 : @xmath40 shows up in a one - loop graph at order @xmath53 .",
    "notice that the only relevant term coming from @xmath40 is quadratic in the magnon field . eliminating time derivatives",
    ", we end up with @xmath54 as in @xmath37 , terms involving the magnetic field do not show up : they have all been eliminated with the equation of motion .",
    "more generally , assuming @xmath55 and @xmath56 to be gauge invariant , there are no tree - graph contributions from these higher order pieces of the effective lagrangian to the vacuum energy  provided that the magnetic field is the only external field considered .",

    "the low - temperature expansion of the partition function is obtained by considering the fluctuations of the field @xmath60 around the ground state @xmath61 , i.e. , by expanding @xmath62 in powers of @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "the leading contribution is of order @xmath31 and contains a term quadratic in @xmath63 which describes free magnons . in the presence of a magnetic field",
    ", they obey the dispersion relation@xcite @xmath65 the remainder of the effective lagrangian is treated as a perturbation . evaluating the gaussian integrals in the standard manner ,",
    "one arrives at a set of feynman rules which differ from the conventional rules of the effective lagrangian method only in one respect : the periodicity condition imposed on the goldstone field modifies the propagator . at finite temperature ,",
    "the propagator is given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the euclidean propagator at zero temperature , @xmath68 note that the above green function corresponds to the propagation of a single magnon , described by the complex field @xmath69 .",

    "anti_ferromagnet , on the other hand , follow a _ linear _ dispersion law . accordingly , the low - temperature properties of these two systems are quite different  the difference reveals itself , e.g. , in the low - temperature expansion for the corresponding order parameters . in this section",
    "we are going to address the two systems within the effective lagrangian perspective .",
    "the low - temperature analysis of an o(n ) antiferromagnet , exhibiting a spontaneously broken internal symmetry o(n ) @xmath0 o(n-1 ) , was the object of reference.@xcite here , we only want to point out some basic ingredients in order to compare the system with the ferromagnet .    in the underlying theory , the o(n ) symmetry of the heisenberg model is explicitly broken by an external anisotropy field @xmath167 .",
    "it is convenient to collect the ( n1 ) goldstone fields @xmath63 in a n - dimensional vector @xmath168 of unit length , @xmath169 and to take the constant external field along the zeroth axis , @xmath170 .",
    "the euclidean form of the effective lagrangian for an o(n ) antiferromagnet up to order @xmath32 then reads:@xcite @xmath171 in the power counting scheme , the field @xmath172 counts as a quantity of order one . for the antiferromagnet , derivatives correspond to one power of the momentum , @xmath173 , whereas the external field @xmath174 counts as a quantity of order @xmath31 .",
    "hence , at leading order ( @xmath175 ) two coupling constants , @xmath176 and @xmath177 , occur , at next - to - leading order ( @xmath178 ) we have five such constants , @xmath179 .",
    "the essential point here is the fact that a term involving a single time derivative does not show up in the effective lagrangian : this topological contribution is proportional to the spontaneous magnetization which , in the case of an antiferromagnet , vanishes .",
    "hence , the corresponding equation of motion is of second order both in space and in time , its relativistic structure determining the number of independent magnon states : the fourier decomposition contains both positive and negative frequencies , such that a single real field suffices to describe one particle .",
    "accordingly , there exist _ two _ different types of spin - wave excitations in an antiferromagnet  as it is the case in lorentz - invariant theories , goldstone fields and goldstone particles are in one - to - one correspondence .",
    "these low - energy excitations follow a linear dispersion relation . as a consequence , in the power counting scheme for antiferromagnetic magnons , powers of momentum",
    "are on the same footing as powers of energy or temperature : @xmath180 .",
    "let us now turn to the evaluation of the partition function of an o(n ) antiferromagnet , n @xmath1812 . the relevant graphs are depicted in figure 4 .",
    "lorentz invariance ensures that only even powers of momentum occur and that loop graphs are suppressed by _ two _ powers of momentum .",
    "shown are all contributions to the free energy density up to order @xmath52 or , equivalently , @xmath182 .",
    "note the striking difference with respect to figure 2 , which displays the feynman graphs relevant for the evaluation of the partition function of an o(3 ) ferromagnet .",
    "= 9.0truecm    the tree graphs 4b and 6c are temperature independent and hence merely renormalize the vacuum energy .",
    "one - loop graph 6b exclusively contains a vertex which is quadratic in the goldstone boson field and thus only contributes to a renormalization of the mass @xmath183 in the free bose gas term related to graph 4a .",
    "the final expression for the renormalized mass takes the form@xcite @xmath184 the logarithmic scale @xmath185 is determined by @xmath186 and @xmath187 , i.e. , by two next - to - leading order coupling constants ( order @xmath32 ) .",
    "the occurrence of such `` chiral logarithms '' is characteristic of the effective lagrangian method in the lorentz - invariant regime . to the order",
    "@xmath52 considered here , we are thus left with only one candidate for the interaction : two - loop graph 6a .    in the limit of a zero external field , the low - temperature expansion of the pressure amounts to @xmath188 the @xmath2 contribution represents the free bose gas term which originates from one - loop graph 4a .",
    "the effective interaction among the goldstone bosons , remarkably , only manifests itself through a term of order @xmath189 , which is beyond the scope of the present discussion .",
    "as it turns out , the contribution of order @xmath52 coming from two - loop graph 6a , is proportional to the external field , such that , in the limit @xmath190 considered here , it vanishes .",
    "it is interesting to note that this two - loop graph , which involves a four magnon - vertex from the leading lagrangian @xmath43 , does not contribute to the pressure of an o(3 ) ferromagnet , either .",
    "the reason , however , is quite different . for the antiferromagnet ,",
    "the contribution is only absent in zero external field , whereas for the ferromagnet the contribution from graph 8 vanishes because of space rotation symmetry or parity .",
    "let us now turn to the order parameters . in the case of an o(3 )",
    "antiferromagnet this quantity is referred to as staggered magnetization .",
    "it is given by the logarithmic derivative of the partition function with respect to the external field @xmath174 and , for an o(n ) antiferromagnet , the low - temperature expansion amounts to ( for details see@xcite ) @xmath191 on the other hand , the low - temperature expansion for the spontaneous magnetization of the o(3 ) ferromagnet , derived in the present paper , reads @xmath192 comparing these formulae for the staggered and spontaneous magnetization , respectively , the following issues are worth pointing out .",
    "obviously , as far as the structure of the low - temperature expansion is concerned , the two series are quite different .",
    "the leading terms ( @xmath193 for the antiferromagnet , @xmath194 for the ferromagnet ) are an immediate consequence of the corresponding dispersion laws : linear for the antiferromagnet , quadratic for the ferromagnet .",
    "they are both related to a one - loop graph .",
    "now we have to emphasize that the evaluation of the partition function for the antiferromagnet was performed in a lorentz - invariant framework , exhibiting a relativistic dispersion law @xmath195 with the speed of light replaced by the spin - wave velocity @xmath196 .",
    "the point is that we did not consider corrections proportional to @xmath197 in the dispersion relation in order to account for the discreteness of the lattice .",
    "equivalently , we did not consider terms in the subleading pieces @xmath198 of the effective lagrangian which , although space rotation invariant , are no longer lorentz invariant . they would have manifested themselves as terms of order @xmath199 in the staggered magnetization of the antiferromagnet . like the analogous terms of order @xmath200 in the spontaneous magnetization of the ferromagnet",
    ", these contributions merely correspond to noninteracting magnons .",
    "what is remarkable , however , is the fact that the two - loop contribution involving a four - magnon vertex from the leading piece @xmath43 of the effective lagrangian vanishes in either case : in the low - temperature series for the staggered and spontaneous magnetization , the spin - wave interaction does not manifest itself through this graph .",
    "note that the reasons are different . for an o(n ) antiferromagnet , there is actually a term proportional to @xmath2 in the low - temperature series ( [ ordpar ] ) for the order parameter .",
    "but for the particular case n=3 we are considering , the term does not show up in the staggered magnetization ",
    "corrections associated with the magnon interaction only appear at order @xmath182.@xcite on the other hand , the two - loop contribution for the ferromagnet , proportional to @xmath162 , vanishes due to space rotation symmetry ",
    "corrections originating from the magnon interaction manifest themselves through the dyson term proportional to four powers of the temperature .",
    "another striking difference concerns the fact that for the antiferromagnet , the low - temperature expansion is completely fixed by a single coupling constant @xmath176 up to order @xmath2 , i.e. , including the first correction coming from the interaction.@xcite this is not the case for the ferromagnet , where the leading interaction term , i.e. , the two - loop contribution @xmath201 , involves coupling constants from the next - to - leading order lagrangian @xmath37 .",
    "we conclude that , for lorentz - noninvariant systems , kinematics is much less restrictive  less information is available via symmetry considerations , such that more phenomenological input for the corresponding nonrelativistic system is required .",
    "the low - energy behavior of an o(3 ) ferromagnet is determined by its low - energy excitations , the magnons or spin waves , which represent the goldstone bosons of the spontaneously broken internal symmetry o(3 ) @xmath0 o(2 ) .",
    "the system may be analyzed within the framework of nonrelativistic effective lagrangians , which tackles the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking from a unified point of view .",
    "the method exploits the symmetry properties of the underlying theory , i.e. , the heisenberg model in the present case , and formulates the dynamics in terms of goldstone boson fields . at large wavelengths ,",
    "the microscopic structure of condensed matter systems does not play a significant role : in the corresponding effective lagrangian , the specific properties of the system only manifest themselves in the numerical values of a few coupling constants .",
    "the low - energy excitations of an o(3 ) ferromagnet obey a _",
    "quadratic _ dispersion relation . in the momentum power counting scheme , which provides us with a systematic expansion of physical quantities in powers of inverse wavelength , two powers of momentum",
    "thus correspond to only one power of energy or temperature .",
    "remarkably , unlike in a lorentz - invariant framework where loop corrections are suppressed by two powers of momentum , loops involving ferromagnetic magnons are suppressed by three momentum powers .    in this nonrelativistic framework , the evaluation of the partition function for an o(3 ) ferromagnet is presented up to order @xmath1 : up to order @xmath24 in the free energy density or , equivalently , up to order @xmath2 in the spontaneous magnetization . in agreement with dyson s microscopic analysis",
    ", we find that , in the spontaneous magnetization , the spin - wave interaction only starts contributing at order @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , within the effective lagrangian perspective we readily understand the absence of a @xmath162 term in the spontaneous magnetization .",
    "this spurious term , which was the object of various microscopic investigations , vanishes because of space rotation symmetry or parity of the leading order effective lagrangian .",
    "the effective lagrangian method not only proves to be more efficient than the complicated microscopic analysis , but also addresses the problem from a model - independent point of view based on the symmetries of the system .",
    "it is very instructive to compare the o(3 ) ferromagnet and the o(3 ) antiferromagnet within the framework of effective lagrangians .",
    "spin waves in antiferromagnets obey a linear dispersion relation , implying that powers of momentum , energy and temperature are all on the same footing : the power counting is identical with the standard , lorentz - invariant scheme . accordingly , the low - temperature properties of these two systems are quite different as illustrated by the low - temperature expansion for the pressure and for the corresponding order parameters , the spontaneous and staggered magnetization , respectively .    having established the power counting scheme for the ferromagnet , we have paved the way for further investigations of this nonrelativistic system within the effective lagrangian perspective . in fact , the low - temperature expansion for the partition function has already been carried to order @xmath202 , where the first three - loop graphs show up .",
    "an outline of the calculation , which goes beyond dyson s microscopic analysis , will be presented in a forthcoming paper.@xcite    it is a pleasure to thank h. leutwyler for numerous stimulating discussions and for his patient assistance throughout this work .",

    "likewise , support by schweizerischer nationalfonds is gratefully acknowledged .    in order to avoid confusion with signs",
    ", the magnetic moment @xmath203 is taken positive : the spin vectors and the spontaneous magnetization , respectively , thus point along the _ same _ direction as the external magnetic field .",
