    "<S> the ratio , @xmath0 , of particle density to magnetic flux shapes the phase - space , as in quantum hall effects . in fermionic ( bosonic ) </S>",
    "<S> ladders , when @xmath0 equals one over an odd ( even ) integer , laughlin fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) states are stabilized for sufficiently long ranged repulsive interactions . as a signature of these fractional states , we find a unique dependence of the chiral currents on particle density and on magnetic flux . </S>",
    "<S> this dependence is characterized by the fractional filling factor @xmath0 , and forms a stringent test for the realization of fqh states in ladders , using either numerical simulations or future ultracold - atom experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the two - leg model is equivalent to a single spinful chain with spin - orbit interactions and a zeeman magnetic field , and results can thus be directly borrowed from one model to the other . </S>"
