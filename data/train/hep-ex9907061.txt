    "the phenomenon of @xmath55 mixing is now well established . in the case of the @xmath56 system , the mass difference , @xmath57 , between the two @xmath56 mass eigenstates has been measured rather precisely  @xcite .",
    "this mass difference gives the oscillation frequency between @xmath56 and @xmath58 .",
    "although these measurements can be used to gain information on the ckm matrix element @xmath59 , this is hampered by large theoretical uncertainties on both the meson decay constant , @xmath60 , and the qcd bag model vacuum insertion parameter , @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "this difficulty may be overcome if @xmath62 , the @xmath1 oscillation frequency , is also measured . in this case",
    ", the ckm information can be extracted via the relation @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the @xmath1 and @xmath56 masses , as the ratio of decay constants for @xmath56 and @xmath1 mesons is much better known than the absolute values @xcite .",
    "information on @xmath66 could then be extracted by inserting @xmath67 , which is relatively well known  @xcite .",
    "the most restrictive of the published limits  @xcite indicates that @xmath68 ps .",
    "@xcite , while the previous best limit from opal  @xcite gives @xmath69  ps . .",
    "a study of @xmath1 oscillation is presented in this paper , using lepton charge to tag the flavour of the @xmath1 at decay and a jet charge technique ( section 3 ) , or opposite - jet leptons where available , to tag the @xmath1 flavour at production .",
    "the analysis studies the oscillation as a function of the proper decay - time reconstructed using secondary vertices ( section 2 ) , using a purity in semileptonic b - decays which is evaluated event - by - event ( section 4 ) .",
    "note that the analysis is sensitive to both @xmath1 and @xmath56 oscillation , but is optimised for the study of @xmath1 oscillation ; the parameters describing the @xmath56 system are input from previous measurements .",
    "the analysis technique is similar to that presented in previous papers  @xcite , but includes more data ( from 1995 ) , takes advantage of three - dimensional vertexing , and features a more sophisticated jet charge definition .",
    "finally , it combines the single lepton and dilepton data .",
    "the analysis was performed on data collected by the opal detector at lep in the vicinity of the @xmath0 peak from 1991 to 1995 .",
    "the opal detector has been described elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "tracking of charged particles is performed by a central detector , consisting of a silicon microvertex detector , a vertex chamber , a jet chamber and @xmath70-chambers . along the @xmath71 beam direction , @xmath72 and @xmath73 being the polar and azimuthal angles .",
    "the origin is taken to be the centre of the detector and @xmath74 is the distance to the @xmath70-axis . ]",
    "the central detector is positioned inside a solenoid , which provides a uniform magnetic field of 0.435 t. the silicon microvertex detector consists of two layers of silicon strip detectors ; the inner layer covers a polar angle range of @xmath75 and the outer layer covers @xmath76 .",
    "this detector provided measurements of hits in the @xmath74-@xmath73 plane for data taken since 1991 , with @xmath70 coordinates also measured since 1993 . the vertex chamber is a precision drift chamber which covers the range @xmath77 .",
    "the jet chamber is a large - volume drift chamber , 4.0  m long and 3.7  m in diameter , providing both tracking and ionisation energy loss ( d@xmath78/d@xmath79 ) information .",
    "the @xmath70-chambers measure the @xmath70-coordinate of tracks as they leave the jet chamber in the range @xmath80 .",
    "the coil is surrounded by a time - of - flight counter array and a barrel lead - glass electromagnetic calorimeter with a presampler . including the endcap electromagnetic calorimeters , the lead - glass blocks cover the range @xmath81 .",
    "the magnet return yoke is instrumented with streamer tubes and serves as a hadron calorimeter . outside the hadron calorimeter",
    "are muon chambers , which cover 93% of the full solid angle .",
    "hadronic @xmath0 decays were selected using criteria described in a previous publication  @xcite .",
    "only data where the silicon microvertex detector was fully functional were accepted , resulting in 2.9 million hadronic @xmath0 decays with 3-dimensional silicon readout ( 3d ) , and 0.9 million with silicon readout only in the @xmath74-@xmath73 projection ( 2d ) .",
    "tracks and electromagnetic clusters not associated to tracks were grouped into jets using a cone jet algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the selection of electrons and muons as candidates for semileptonic decays of b hadrons followed the procedure described in the previous paper  @xcite , the exception being that an improved purity tag at a later stage of the analysis allowed the cut on the lepton neural network @xmath82 to be loosened from 0.7 to 0.5 .",
    "monte carlo events were generated using the jetset 7.4 program  @xcite with parameters tuned to opal data  @xcite , and were processed by the detector simulation program  @xcite .",
    "an attempt to reconstruct the proper decay time of the parent b hadron was made for each jet containing a lepton with a minimum @xmath83 of 0.7  relative to the jet axis .",
    "the algorithm used to reconstruct the decay length of the supposed parent b - hadron was different from that described previously  @xcite . in principle , each b jet should contain two vertices other than the primary vertex , corresponding to the decays of the b and c hadrons .",
    "these two vertices are referred to as the secondary and tertiary vertices , respectively . in the new algorithm ,",
    "the positions of the secondary and tertiary vertices are allowed to vary independently in a maximum likelihood fit , where the likelihood is calculated for each vertex position by taking the product of likelihoods of all the tracks in the jet .",
    "each track contributes a likelihood of @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the probability for the track to originate from the secondary vertex , as determined from the track momentum and angle relative to the jet direction . for the lepton candidate , @xmath85",
    "is fixed to 1 .",
    "the quantities @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the probabilities for the track to be compatible with belonging to the primary , secondary or tertiary vertices respectively , based on the impact parameters relative to the assumed vertex positions both in @xmath74-@xmath73 and @xmath74-@xmath70 .",
    "such a fit has 6 free parameters : the b decay length , the d decay length and two angles each for the b direction and the d direction . in practice ,",
    "the power of the fit to measure the d decay length was found to be poor .",
    "the resolution was therefore improved by imposing a constraint on the d decay length , @xmath89 : the likelihood was multiplied by @xmath90 where @xmath91  cm was an average d decay length in the monte carlo , and @xmath89 was constrained to be positive .",
    "the effect of this constraint is to put the fitted d decay length to 0 for most vertices , effectively reducing the number of free parameters to three .",
    "gaussian constraints are imposed on the b direction angles , using the results of a b direction - finding algorithm similar to that described in  @xcite , which weighted tracks according to their rapidity relative to the estimated b direction .",
    "loose constraints were also imposed on the d direction angles .",
    "the b decay length was constrained to lie in the range -0.4  cm to 2.5  cm .    for leptons coming from semileptonic",
    "b decays , according to monte carlo with 3d silicon information , about 4% of the jets considered were rejected as containing fewer than 3 tracks passing the quality requirements . in about 8% of cases the fit did not successfully converge , and these candidates were rejected .",
    "about 2% of the candidates were rejected with the fitted b decay length less than -0.4  cm . to ensure that the results of the fit were stable and unambiguous",
    ", candidates were rejected if the likelihood was improved when the decay length was increased by 1 standard deviation . in addition , a scan of the likelihood was made as a function of the b decay length with the other parameters kept fixed . if the log likelihood was within 1.75 of the fitted result for any b decay length further than two standard deviations from the central value , the candidate was rejected .",
    "these two requirements rejected about 24% of the candidates .",
    "thus , in total , about 62% of leptons from b decays were selected with a successful fit .",
    "for these leptons , the b decay length , @xmath92 , and its uncertainty , @xmath93 , were taken directly from the fit .",
    "given a reconstructed secondary vertex , the b energy was determined in a similar way to that described previously  @xcite .",
    "the energy of the jet containing the lepton was reconstructed using the @xmath0 mass to constrain the event kinematics , and the estimated contribution from fragmentation particles was subtracted .",
    "the fragmentation particles were separated from the b - hadron decay products using momentum , angle and vertex information .",
    "the uncertainty of the b boost , @xmath94 , was determined from the estimated uncertainties on the charged and neutral fragmentation energies , which were determined from the estimated probabilities for each track or cluster to originate from a fragmentation particle .",
    "the selected vertices were split into two classes , a and b , according to the quality of the proper time reconstruction .",
    "the better quality secondary vertices ( class a ) were selected by requiring that    * the mass of the reconstructed vertex , using association probabilities for each track as calculated in the likelihood , was larger than 0.5  gev ; * the @xmath95 per degree of freedom of the vertex configuration was less than 6 ; * the angle between the lepton direction and the vector joining the primary and secondary vertices was larger than 110 mrad ; * the ratio of lepton @xmath83 ( relative to the jet axis ) and momentum @xmath96 was less then 0.35 ; * the reconstructed jet energy was required to not exceed the constrained jet energy by more than 2  gev .",
    "the reconstructed jet energy , computed as the sum of energies of all tracks and clusters in the jet , should normally be smaller than the constrained jet energy because of the missing neutrino from the semileptonic decay .",
    "class a contains 67% of the selected vertices for leptons from b decays in monte carlo ; the remaining 33% constitute class b.    the proper time , @xmath97 , is given by  . ] : @xmath98 as in the previous analysis  @xcite , use is also made of the estimated uncertainty , @xmath99 , on the proper time , calculated from the separately estimated uncertainties on the decay length , @xmath93 , and the boost factor , @xmath94 : @xmath100 where correlations between the uncertainties on @xmath92 and @xmath101 are neglected .",
    "this is unimportant because the shape of the @xmath97 distribution is parametrised from monte carlo , where such correlations are included .",
    "the distribution of estimated @xmath99 is shown for the data for all selected vertices in figure  [ fig : sigt ] together with the monte carlo prediction .",
    "the slight discrepancy that is visible is not important , as the analysis uses the value of @xmath99 estimated for each event .",
    "plots indicating the proper time resolution for @xmath1 vertices with estimated @xmath102  ps are shown in figure  [ fig : tres ] , together with curves from the fitted resolution functions , defined as in the previous paper  @xcite .",
    "note that different resolution functions are used for class a and class b vertices .",
    "the plots are for the 3d silicon readout ; the resolution functions were determined separately for events with 2d silicon readout , where the resolution is similar ( though the efficiency is worse ) .",
    "events were accepted only if they contained at least one vertex with @xmath102  ps .",
    "this proper time resolution is necessary to give sensitivity to @xmath103  ps . .",
    "a second identified lepton was considered only if separated by more than @xmath104 from the first lepton ( the leptons are ordered using @xmath96 and @xmath83 ) .",
    "a second vertex in the event , containing a second identified lepton , was accepted if it had @xmath105  ps .",
    "these requirements led to 43598 events selected in the 3d data , of which 5012 had a second identified lepton and 1788 had two valid vertices . for the 2d data ,",
    "9452 events were selected , of which 1019 had a second identified lepton and 175 had two valid vertices .",
    "the distributions of reconstructed proper time are shown in figure  [ fig : trec ] for the single lepton and dilepton events together with the monte carlo prediction .",
    "only one proper time per event , satisfying @xmath102  ps , is included in the figure for the dilepton events .",
    "the proper time distributions are given separately for the 93 - 95 data and the 91 - 92 data ( only 2d silicon information available ) .",
    "in both cases , the monte carlo gives a reasonable description of the data .",
    "also indicated are the contributions from @xmath106 decays and from hadronic @xmath0 decays to @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 or @xmath110 .",
    "the remaining contributions from @xmath111 events , such as @xmath112 decays and background leptons , are not indicated , but are included in the total .",
    "in order to detect oscillation , one needs to determine the b - flavour ( b or @xmath2 ) of the @xmath1 both at the time of production and decay .",
    "the flavour at decay is inferred from the charge of the daughter lepton .",
    "the flavour at production is obtained from the charge of a lepton , where available , in the hemisphere opposite to the first lepton . for events containing",
    "only one identified lepton , it is determined by a modified jet charge technique using information in both hemispheres . the rest of this section describes the modified jet charge technique .",
    "the lepton hemisphere is defined by the axis of the jet that contains the lepton . for this hemisphere , an unweighted jet charge , as used in the previous analysis  @xcite , has the desirable property that the decay products of a neutral b meson contribute a net charge of zero , provided they are fully contained in the jet .",
    "the jet charge therefore depends only on the net charge of the fragmentation tracks , and hence depends on the produced b - flavour . however , there is extra information that this method does not utilise .",
    "the leading charged meson from fragmentation should reflect the b production flavour ; also , it should have a different angular distribution and a different momentum spectrum than the other fragmentation products . for @xmath1 production",
    ", this leading fragmentation meson should have an enhanced probability to be a k meson .    to exploit this supplementary information ,",
    "a number of jet / hemisphere charge variables were defined :    * the unweighted jet charge , @xmath113 , summing over all tracks in the jet ; * the unweighted hemisphere charge , @xmath113 , summing over all tracks in the lepton hemisphere ; * @xmath114 , a weighted hemisphere charge , where a neural network is used to assign the weights ( see below ) ; * @xmath115 , a variant on @xmath114 ( see below ) .",
    "each of these variables was multiplied by the lepton charge , @xmath116 , to provide sensitivity to mixing , and fed into a neural network , trained to separate unmixed @xmath1 decays ( where the flavour is the same at production and decay ) from mixed @xmath1 decays , with an output @xmath117 ( ` same ' stands for the same hemisphere as the lepton ) . to determine the weights used for @xmath118 , a neural network was trained on @xmath1 hemispheres to distinguish fragmentation tracks whose charge is opposite to that of the produced b quark ( as expected for the leading charged fragmention meson ) from those that have the same charge .",
    "four inputs were chosen per track : the rapidity relative to the jet , the track momentum divided by the jet energy and de / dx weights for the @xmath119 and k hypotheses .",
    "b decay products were excluded from the network training .",
    "the neural network output , @xmath120 , gives a weak separation between right and wrong sign fragmentation tracks .",
    "a hemisphere charge was formed to exploit this : @xmath121 where the summation is over all tracks in the same hemisphere as the lepton .",
    "however , the output range with the best separation also includes a large background from @xmath1 decay products . a second neural network , with output @xmath122 ,",
    "was therefore implemented to separate fragmentation tracks from b decay products using the track impact parameters and significances in both @xmath74-@xmath73 and @xmath74-@xmath70 projections .",
    "a variant on the above hemisphere charge was formed : @xmath123 where the summation is over all tracks in the same hemisphere as the lepton .",
    "this hemisphere charge is not optimal , because the important charge correlations between tracks ( especially those from the @xmath1 decay ) have been neglected .",
    "in fact , when combined with the lepton charge , the unweighted hemisphere or jet charge gives a separation of mixed and unmixed @xmath1 decays that is superior to that obtained with @xmath114 or @xmath115 .",
    "however , the correlation of @xmath124 with the unweighted hemisphere charge is not very strong , allowing the combination to achieve a superior performance . the neural network output for the combination , @xmath117 ,",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : qj3](a ) for unmixed and mixed @xmath1 decays .",
    "the power to separate mixed from unmixed @xmath1 decays is approximately 40% better than the unweighted hemisphere or the unweighted jet charge alone .",
    "the distribution of @xmath117 for the selected data events is compared to monte carlo in figure  [ fig : qtdat](a ) , where a reasonable agreement is seen .",
    "the opposite hemisphere is defined by the axis of the highest energy jet in the event other than the lepton jet . for this hemisphere , a similar approach",
    "was taken , though the situation is simpler in that it is not necessary to distinguish fragmentation particles from b decay products since both may carry useful charge information .",
    "a number of variables sensitive to the b production flavour were defined :    * @xmath125 where the sum is over all tracks in the highest energy jet in the hemisphere using @xmath126 and @xmath127 is the longitudinal momentum of track @xmath128 relative to the jet axis ; * @xmath129 using @xmath130 ; * @xmath131 defined below , using a neural network output for each track in the hemisphere opposite the lepton ; * vertex charge information - 2 parameters @xmath132 and @xmath133 ( see below ) .",
    "the charge variables were multiplied by the lepton charge and a neural network , trained to separate unmixed @xmath1 decays from mixed @xmath1 decays , was used to combine the 5 input variables , giving an output @xmath134 .    for the @xmath131 variable ,",
    "a neural network was trained to enhance tracks with the desired charge correlation with the lepton ( opposite in the absence of mixing ) , using the same four inputs per track as for the track neural network used in the lepton hemisphere .",
    "a probability @xmath135 that the lepton parent was produced as a @xmath136 rather than a @xmath1 is formed for each track , @xmath128 : @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the output of this neural network for track @xmath128 .",
    "the tracks are combined into an overall probability per hemisphere , assuming that the probabilities are independent : @xmath139 the power of @xmath131 to separate mixed from unmixed b decays , when multiplied by the lepton charge , is very similar to that of the conventional @xmath140 which was used in the previous paper  @xcite .",
    "the two quantities are strongly correlated , but some gain can still be achieved by combining them . excluding the vertex charge information , the neural net combination of the 3 charge variables results in a hemisphere charge with a separation power 23% better than that of @xmath140 alone .",
    "further improvement to the opposite hemisphere charge tag can be made by tagging charged b decays using vertex charge , as described in a recent paper  @xcite .",
    "this gave two variables : @xmath132 and @xmath133 , which were available for about 40% of events ( where vertices significantly separated from the primary vertex were found ) .",
    "this information , suitably transformed , was fed into the 5 input neural network .",
    "the 5 inputs were still used when no vertex information was available , with the extra 2 inputs set to register the lack of information . a further improvement of about 10% in separation power was obtained from the inclusion of the vertex charge information , and the network output , @xmath134 , is shown in figure  [ fig : qj3](b ) for unmixed and mixed @xmath1 decays .",
    "the distribution of @xmath134 for the selected data events , shown in figure  [ fig : qtdat](b ) , is well described by the monte carlo prediction .",
    "the monte carlo test samples indicate that the individual values of both @xmath117 and @xmath134 give the charge tag purity for @xmath1 mesons fairly accurately .",
    "since they are largely independent they may be combined simply to give a measure of the probability that the @xmath1 mixed : @xmath141 where the offset of @xmath142 is introduced so that when @xmath143 there is no information on whether the @xmath1 mixed .",
    "the performance of @xmath144 is shown in figure  [ fig : qj3](c ) , and has a separation power that is 40% better than @xmath145 , used in the previous analysis  @xcite .",
    "the distribution of @xmath144 for the selected data events is shown in figure  [ fig : qtdat ] , together with the monte carlo prediction .",
    "the good agreement observed serves as a check on the power of the charge tag .",
    "the selected lepton candidates contain significant contributions from sources other than the semileptonic decays of b hadrons , notably @xmath112 decays , background leptons either in @xmath146 events or in lighter quark events and @xmath147 decays in @xmath148 events  @xcite .",
    "the probability that a lepton candidate originated from a given source , ignoring lifetime information in the lepton jet , was evaluated using properties of the lepton jet and of the opposite hemisphere .",
    "these probabilities are used in the fit ( described later ) to scale the likelihood functions corresponding to each source , where these likelihood functions describe the reconstructed proper time and charge correlation .    for single lepton events , the value of @xmath82 , the lepton neural network output , was used together with a b - tag from the opposite hemisphere to produce a single variable that tags the purity of semileptonic decays of b hadrons . for dilepton events",
    "the purity was determined from the two values of @xmath82 .",
    "the opposite hemisphere tag selects the highest energy jet in the thrust hemisphere opposite to that containing the lepton jet . in this jet ,",
    "a neural network was used to separate tracks with good quality 3d impact parameter information coming from b jets from those coming from light quark jets ( u , d or s ) .",
    "the inputs were the impact parameters and their significances in both projections , the distance of closest approach of the track to the jet axis and the @xmath95 for the track to intersect this axis .",
    "the neural network outputs for the individual tracks were multiplied together to form a jet probability , @xmath149 .",
    "not all tracks with silicon information in the @xmath74-@xmath73 plane have reliable 3d impact parameter information , so a simpler variable was also constructed , based solely on the impact parameter significances in the @xmath74-@xmath73 plane . in this case , @xmath150 was constructed by multiplying the likelihoods for each track to be consistent with the primary vertex .",
    "the likelihood had a simple double - gaussian form . a neural network combined @xmath149 , @xmath150 , the numbers of tracks used for each of these quantities , the @xmath151 of the jet axis , and fox - wolfram moments which also have distinguishing power between b jets and light - quark jets .",
    "the neural network was trained to separate b jets from u , d or s jets ( charm events have properties that are intermediate ) . the neural network output , @xmath152 , is shown in figure  [ fig : bhemi ] for @xmath111 events and events from lighter quarks .    to form the event b - tag @xmath153 , a neural network was used to combine @xmath82 with @xmath152 ( though simply multiplying together the purities obtained from each tag would yield a similar performance ) .",
    "the distribution of @xmath153 is shown in figure  [ fig : btag ] for the data , together with the monte carlo prediction and the component from semileptonic decays of b hadrons .",
    "also shown in the figure are the corresponding @xmath153 distributions with @xmath154  ps .",
    "a comparison of these two figures indicates that the light quark background is reasonably modelled .",
    "a maximum likelihood fit was constructed , similar to that described previously for single lepton events  @xcite and for dilepton events  @xcite .",
    "the following quantities were input per event for the three classes of events :    1 .",
    "single lepton events : @xmath97 , @xmath99 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 ; 2 .",
    "dilepton events with one vertex : @xmath97 , @xmath99 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 ; 3 .",
    "dilepton events with two vertices : @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 ,    where the superscripts are used to differentiate between the two leptons where appropriate . as mentioned before , the purities of the different sources were calculated event - by - event from the appropriate inputs , taking the distributions of these quantities from monte carlo for each source .",
    "the monte carlo predicts that @xmath111 events account for 81% of the single lepton events , 93.6% of the dilepton events with one vertex and 98.3% of the dilepton events with two vertices . for the selected vertices in @xmath111 events ,",
    "87.5% were predicted to come from @xmath106 ( or @xmath164 , @xmath165 , or @xmath166 )  , @xmath165 and half of the @xmath167 decays are classed together with @xmath106 because they have the same charge correlation between the lepton and the b quark . ]",
    "decays and 9.2% from @xmath112 ( or @xmath166 ) decays . of",
    "the @xmath106 decays , an estimated 10.5% involve @xmath1 mesons .    in this paper ,",
    "the only parameter that is varied in the fit is the @xmath1 oscillation amplitude , @xmath168 , as defined in @xcite and used in the previous paper  @xcite .",
    "the probability density for a produced @xmath1 to decay as a @xmath1 after time @xmath169 is : @xmath170 and to decay as a @xmath136 is : @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the @xmath1 lifetime . at the true oscillation frequency ,",
    "the fitted value of @xmath168 should be consistent with 1 .",
    "far from the true frequency , the expectation value for @xmath168 is 0 .",
    "therefore , values of @xmath62 may be excluded when @xmath168 is below 1 and inconsistent with 1 .",
    "since @xmath62 is large , the fitted value of @xmath168 is relatively insensitive to sources of systematic uncertainty that affect the mean @xmath155 or the overall like - sign fraction in the case of the dilepton events .",
    "therefore a complicated fitting scheme , as used in the previous paper  @xcite , to reduce the impact of these systematic errors is not necessary here .",
    "this also implies that this analysis is not optimal for @xmath62 values below about 2  ps . .",
    "unlike the previous analysis  @xcite , the purity of the b production flavour tag is taken to be independent of @xmath62 or the fitted amplitude .",
    "the uncertainty on this tagging purity is assessed from the comparison of data and monte carlo shown in figure  [ fig : qtdat ] .",
    "this agreement is also sensitive to the overall mixed fraction , @xmath173 , averaged over all b hadrons - which is measured to be @xmath174  @xcite and the fraction of @xmath112 decays , taken to have a 15% uncertainty  @xcite .",
    "the performance of the fit was first tested using monte carlo simulated data .",
    "figure  [ fig : mcscan ] shows the fitted amplitude as a function of @xmath62 for four samples generated with different true @xmath62 values .",
    "these four monte carlo samples are statistically correlated , because the same monte carlo events are used to simulate different oscillation frequencies .",
    "each represents 6.8 million hadronic z decays ( approximately double the statistics available in the data ) .    the behaviour of these samples is consistent with expectation . at low values of true @xmath62 ,",
    "a clear peak is seen at @xmath175 , while at higher frequencies the sensitivity is insufficient .",
    "in addition , tests were performed for true @xmath62 values up to 15  ps .   using additional monte carlo samples containing only @xmath146 events .",
    "the results of these tests , representing greater statistical power , were also consistent with expectation .    for the data ,",
    "separate results were obtained for the 91 - 92 data ( 2d silicon ) ( 9452 events selected ) and the 93 - 95 data ( 3d silicon ) ( 43598 events selected ) .",
    "these results are shown in figure  [ fig:2d3d ] , where the errors are statistical only .",
    "the data can also be split into single lepton ( 47109 events ) and dilepton ( 6031 events ) samples .",
    "these results are also shown in figure  [ fig:2d3d ] .",
    "it can be seen that the single lepton results are more precise , except at very low frequency , where the dilepton events are sensitive to mixing on both sides of the event .",
    "no significant evidence for a signal at any particular frequency is seen in any of the four plots .",
    "the fact that the measured amplitude is consistent with 0 at low frequencies , in each case , implies that no systematic problems are evident .",
    "systematic errors arise from a number of sources .",
    "their effect was determined by varying the appropriate parameter and obtaining a new set of amplitude results .",
    "this was done using the full data sample , with the exception of the resolution function uncertainties where monte carlo was also used , as described below .",

    "two alternative methods are then considered to determine whether the value of @xmath62 is excluded :    a ) : :    values are excluded where the probability of measuring an amplitude    lower than that observed would be less than 5% were that value of    @xmath62 the correct one , i.e.    @xmath179    or b ) : :    the same definition , but limited to the positive region , i.e.    @xmath180    the first definition gives a true 95% confidence level , in the sense that there is a 5% probability to exclude the true value .",

    "the second definition makes use of the fact that the predicted value of @xmath168 lies between 0 and 1 , regardless of the value of @xmath62 .",

    "the experiment was not able to resolve the oscillations , but can place a lower limit @xmath3  ps .  at the 95% confidence level .",
    "this result is consistent with previous publications  @xcite , and supersedes the previously published opal results  @xcite .",
