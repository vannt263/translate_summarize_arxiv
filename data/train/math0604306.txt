    "this paper is a continuation of @xcite ( which we refer as part i ) on the twistor spaces of joyce metrics on the connected sum of four complex projective planes . in part",
    "i the twistor spaces were explicitly constructed for one family of joyce metrics on @xmath0 .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to do the same thing for another family of joyce metrics on @xmath0 .",
    "the method and ideas we will take is broadly similar to that of part i. namely we first investigate the anticanonical system of the twistor space and show that the associated map is bimeromorphic onto its image .",
    "then the defining equations of the image are explicitly given in some @xmath1-bundle over a projective line .",
    "finally we construct the biholomorphic model of the twistor space by taking blowing - ups and blowing - downs of the anticanonical model .    however , there are many differences between the present case and part i. first , in part i , the anticanonical model of the twistor space was a complete intersection in @xmath1 of degree 8 . in the present case",
    "it is not a complete intersection but an ( ideal theoretic ) intersection of 10 quadratic hypersurfaces in @xmath2 . at first glance",
    "this seems to make situation more complicated .",
    "but it will turn out that this is not true ; in part i the anticanonical model has ` redundant divisors ' which do not exist in the actual twistor space , and to blow - down these divisors are the most difficult step in the construction . for the present case",
    "there are no such divisors and consequently the construction of the twistor spaces becomes considerably simpler .",
    "we again remark that a reader who is interested in the construction itself can consult section 3 and figures there directly .",
    "the results of section 2 are needed in order to prove that the constructed 3-folds are actually the twistor spaces of joyce metrics .",
    "as briefly explained in  2.1 of part i , there are precisely 3 equivalence classes of smooth effective @xmath3-actions on @xmath0 and for each equivalence class there associates a family of joyce metrics on @xmath0 .",
    "one of the family consists of special forms of lebrun metrics @xcite and their twistor spaces are explicitly constructed in @xcite .",
    "the remaining 2 ( equivalence classes of ) smooth effective @xmath3-actions can be represented by the following sequences of isotropy subgroups respectively : @xmath4 @xmath5 in @xcite we constructed the twistor spaces of joyce metrics on @xmath0 whose @xmath3-action is of type i. the purpose of the present paper is to do the same thing for joyce metrics on @xmath0 whose @xmath3-action is of type ii . before its investigation , partly in order to set the notations , we again quote a result of a. fujiki about structure of the twistor spaces of joyce metrics in general :    [ prop-01]@xcite let @xmath6 be the twistor space of a joyce metric on @xmath7 which is different from lebrun metrics",

    ". then bs @xmath13 .",
    "( iii ) if we write @xmath14 in such a way that @xmath15 and @xmath16 intersect , the real structure on @xmath6 exchanges @xmath15 and @xmath17 , where the subscriptions are counted modulo @xmath18 .",

    "always denote the twistor space of a joyce metric on @xmath0 whose @xmath3-action is type ii . in order to investigate the anticanonical system of @xmath6 , as in the case of type i , we study bi - anticanonical system of a general member @xmath11 of the pencil @xmath19 . by proposition [ prop-01 ]",

    "the following argument is similar to that of lemma 2.3 in @xcite .",
    "actually ( i ) and ( ii ) can be verified by standard calculations as in @xcite . for ( iii ) , we again use the theory of toric varieties to compute the natural @xmath9-action on @xmath47 and conclude that it is given by @xmath48 for a coordinate @xmath49 on @xmath50 . by similar computation we obtain of ( iv ) . to obtain defining equations of the image @xmath51 in @xmath1",

    "we can deduce by elementary computations that there is a unique non - degenerate component and its defining ideal is generated by 9 equations .",
    "the final assertion of ( iv ) can be verified by direct calculation using .",
    "we note that the degree of the surface is six , since @xmath38 is a birational morphism and the self - intersection number of the movable part of @xmath68 is six .",

    "( iii ) if @xmath37 is as in lemma [ lemma-01 ] , then @xmath75 is precisely the blowing - downs of the six @xmath76 curves @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",

    "let @xmath290 be the blowing - up along the cycle @xmath12 which is the base curve of the system @xmath19 .",
    "then there exists an isomorphism between @xmath291 and @xmath289 which commutes with the real structure .    proof . by using our explicit constructions",
    ", it can be verified that all the fibers of the 2 fiber spaces @xmath292 and @xmath293 are isomorphic as toric surfaces .",
    "it can also be checked that the real structure on @xmath289 has no fixed points and exchanges @xmath15 and @xmath30 for @xmath143 .",

    "* theorem 8.1 ) , to show the existence of an isomorphism between @xmath289 and @xmath291 compatible with the real structures , it suffices to prove that there exists a real smooth rational curves @xmath294 in @xmath289 satisfying ( i ) @xmath294 is two to one over @xmath119 and the 2 branch points of @xmath295 do not on the real locus on @xmath119 , and ( ii ) @xmath294 is disjoint from the @xmath9-invariant cycle of 12 rational curves in any fibers . for this",
    ", it suffices to take a general twistor line @xmath296 which is disjoint from the cycle @xmath12 and letting @xmath294 to be the strict transform of the image @xmath297 into @xmath289 .",
    "in fact , ( i ) is satisfied by the same reasoning as that in the last paragraph of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.2 ) .",
    "moreover , since @xmath116 gives a biholomorphic map between the unions of all 2-dimensional @xmath9-orbits in @xmath6 and @xmath251 , and since step 13 do not touch the latter union of @xmath9-orbits in @xmath251 , @xmath294 is disjoint from the @xmath9-invariant cycles in any fiber .",
    "thus @xmath294 satisfies ( ii ) as well .",
    "@xmath67    the above proof is pretty easier than that of the corresponding result ( theorem 3.1 ) in @xcite .",
    "there , we have to take account of the effect of ` blowing - down of the redundant divisors ' ( step 5 in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3 ) ) , to obtain the above property ( ii ) for @xmath294 .",
    "namely , there was a possibility that the property ( ii ) is lost under the blowing - downs of the divisors . in the present case ( type ii )",
    "we do not blow - down any divisors through steps 13 and this makes the proof much simpler ."
