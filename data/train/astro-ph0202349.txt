    "the recently - discovered soft x  ray transient ( sxt ) xte  j1118 + 480 ( = kv uma ; remillard et al 2000 ) lies at high galactic latitude , close to the lockman hole in the local ism .",
    "the exceptionally low interstellar absorption permits unprecedented wavelength coverage ( mauche et al 2000 , hynes et al 2000 , mcclintock et al 2001b , chaty et al 2002 ) .",
    "a low amplitude photometric modulation with period 4.1  hr was reported by cook et al ( 2000 ) and uemura et al ( 2000 ) .",
    "dubus et al ( 2000 ) present spectroscopy showing an emission line radial velocity ` s - wave ' modulation at a period close to this .",
    "this period was recently confirmed as orbital , and a mass function of @xmath3 was measured by mcclintock et al ( 2001a ) and wagner et al ( 2001 ) .",
    "therefore the accretor clearly has to be a black hole .",
    "we present the uv line spectrum of , which we compare with that of another recent sxt , xtej1859 + 226 .",
    "full analyses of these hst spectra will be presented elsewhere ( hynes et al 2002a , b ; chaty et al 2002 ) .",
    "here we focus on the prior evolution of .",
    "we obtained _ hst _ spectra of xtej1859 + 226 near the peak of outburst on 1999 october 18 and 27 and november 6 . at each epoch",
    "far - uv spectra were obtained using the low - resolution g140l grating and wide ( 0.5arcsec ) slit , yielding wavelength coverage 11501730  and resolution @xmath4 .",
    "we used the standard pipeline data products except that the spectral extraction was done by hand using the iraf implementation of optimal extraction .",
    "this gave a significantly cleaner removal of geocoronal emission lines ( principally ly @xmath5 and oi 1302 ) .",
    "after extracting the one - dimensional spectra ( with the pipeline wavelength and flux calibrations ) , we resampled them onto a common wavelength grid and took an exposure - time weighted average .    for xtej1118 + 480",
    ", we obtained high - resolution ( echelle ) spectra using the e140 m grating and 0.2arcsec square aperture on 2000 april 8 , 18 and 29 , may 28 , june 24 , and july 8 .",
    "the pipeline extraction was adequate , although a few high pixel values had to be replaced by hand .",
    "the extracted spectra were rebinned into 0.2  bins and averaged with exposure - time weighting .",
    "the process is clearly not perfect . in particular , there are a number of abrupt steps in the spectrum at longer wavelengths .",
    "these artefacts , at @xmath6per cent level , arise from inconsistencies in the relative flux calibration of adjacent echelle orders .",
    "figure 1 gives the uv spectra of and xte j1859 + 226 .",
    "both show interstellar absorption features . in these",
    "appear sharper because the spectral resolution was higher .",
    "the difference in the equivalent widths of the emission lines in the two systems is striking ( fig . 1 , table 1 ; haswell et al 2000 ) .",
    "in xtej1859 + 226 civ is the strongest line , with nv , ciii , ov , siiv , and heii also strongly present .",
    "these emission line strengths are roughly as expected for an x - ray bright lmxb ( cf sco x-1 , kallman , boroson , & vrtilek 1998 ) . compared to cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , the nv / civ ratio is relatively large , while siiv / civ is small , as expected for a high ionisation parameter ( mauche , lee & kallman 1997 ) .",
    "in contrast , for xtej1118 + 480 , the carbon and oxygen lines are undetectable , while the nv emission appears enhanced .",
    "a similar anomalous emission line spectrum is seen in the magnetic cv ae aqr , in which the nv is much stronger than the civ line ( jameson et al 1980 , eracleous et al 1994 ) .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the niv 1718@xmath7 line would add a valuable additional constraint on the interpretation of the line spectrum in terms of the photo - ionisation conditions , so we carefully assessed our spectra to determine whether it was present .",
    "unfortunately our well - exposed e140 m echelle spectrum stops at 1710@xmath7 and our e230 m echelle spectrum suffers from shorter total exposure and the low sensitivity of the nuv mama in this region .",
    "1718@xmath7 falls right on the boundary between the two stis mama detectors , and consequently neither is optimised at this wavelength .",
    "we find no strong ( @xmath8 ) line in the spectrum , but this upper limit provides a weak constraint due to the poor quality of our data at this wavelength .      the ly@xmath2 absorption in ( fig .",
    "1 ) clearly has a sharp core , which is probably interstellar , with very broad wings .",
    "the continuum slope is well constrained by the spectrum longwards of @xmath9 .",
    "extrapolating this continuum is suggestive of broad ly@xmath2 extending from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "the combination of noise , nv emission , and absorption features hinder measurement of the ly@xmath2 wings , but they definitely extend at least from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "the broad absorption may be damped ly@xmath2 from the hi in our galaxy ( bowen , priv.comm . ) .",
    "if we assume , instead , that it is due to absorbing gas executing keplerian motion around the black hole , and take the largest width suggested by our data , the full width implies velocities of @xmath14 and absorbing material at distances as close as @xmath15 .",
    "taking the securely determined line width would imply absorption from keplerian material at @xmath16 .",
    "an independent line of argument based on the shape of the spectral energy distribution , and dependent on the value of the neutral hydrogen column density , @xmath17 , has been used to estimate the disc inner radius ( hynes et al 2000 , mcclintock et al 2001 , chaty et al 2002 ) .",
    "hynes et al ( 2000 ) estimate @xmath18 , a choice which suggests the disc is terminated at @xmath19 .",
    "this is inconsistent with the keplerian interpretation of the broad ly@xmath2 absorption .",
    "alternatively , informed by the _ chandra _ data , mcclintock et al ( 2001 ) suggest that @xmath17 could be as high as @xmath20 , with @xmath21 .",
    "chaty et al ( 2002 ) adopt @xmath22 , which leads to @xmath23 .",
    "the latter two values are consistent with the keplerian interpretation of the broad ly@xmath2 absorption .",
    "the feature near @xmath24 does not have an obvious identification and we believe it may be spurious , although it does not correspond to any known instrumental artefacts ( sahu 2001 priv .",
    "this issue is under investigation .",
    "the civ 1550@xmath25 and the nv 1240@xmath7 lines are both resonance lines of lithium - like ions , and are produced under essentially the same physical conditions .",
    "kallman and mccray ( 1982 , hereafter km82 ) present theoretical models of compact x - ray sources predicting the ionisation structure expected in a wide variety of astrophysical situations , including galactic x - ray binaries . km82",
    "present 8 distinct models ; in each one the source luminosity , @xmath26 , spectral shape , and gas density , @xmath27 , are fixed . for each model the output includes the dependence on ionisation parameter , @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 is the distance from the central source ) of the abundances ( as a fraction of the total elemental abundance ) of the ions of common elements .",
    "km82 consider ( i ) three species detected in both and xtej1859 + 226 : heii , siiv , and nv ; and ( ii ) three species detected only in the spectrum of xtej1859 + 226 : civ , ciii , and ov . strikingly similar ionisation parameters were required for the two sets of lines in all models . in almost all cases the presence of nv places the tightest constraint on @xmath30 , and almost invariably this is encompassed within the range producing civ . in the minority of cases where there exists an ionisation parameter which produces nv and not civ , this range also produces ov . consequently , km82 give no set of photoionisation parameters which would predict production of nv in while suppressing the civ and ov .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of is clearly different from that of xtej1859 + 226 : the former is an extended power - law ( hynes et al 2000 , mcclintock et al 2001 , frontera et al 2001 , chaty et al 2002 ) with a cut - off at @xmath31  kev indicative of the low - hard state , and often attributed to an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; e.g. esin et al 2001 ) ; while in the early stages of the outburst the latter was dominated by the soft thermal black - body disk spectrum which turned over by @xmath32  kev ( hynes et al 2002a ) , typical of the high - soft state .",
    "ho et al ( 2000 ) note that the characteristically harder ionising spectrum of an adaf lowers the effective ionisation parameter , and hence favours the production of lower ionisation species .",
    "hence , if anything , the differences in the x - ray spectra should cause civ to be relatively prominent ( compared with nv ) in , rather than being suppressed as we observe .",
    "hamann and ferland ( 1992 ) used the observed civ 1550@xmath25 and nv 1240@xmath7 lines to estimate the n / c abundance ratio in high redshift qsos .",
    "their photionisation calculations show that for a broad range of ionisation parameters the nv 1240@xmath7 / civ 1550@xmath25 line ratio is lower at lower metalicities even when the n / c abundance ratio is kept constant .",
    "this means that if anything we should expect the nv 1240@xmath7 line to be suppressed relative to civ 1550@xmath25 in which is a halo object , and consequently might be expected to have a lower metalicity than that of xtej1859 + 226 .",
    "a definitive abundance analysis for would require exact knowledge of the geometry , densities , and ionising spectrum in the regions emitting the uv lines . while hynes et al ( 2000 , 2002b ) gives some information on the geometry , and chaty et al .",
    "( 2002 ) gives good coverage of the x - ray spectrum , the euv spectrum remains open to significant uncertainty ( compare the range of dereddened euv spectra in chaty et al 2002 , mcclintock et al 2001 , esin et al 2001 , hynes et al 2000 , merloni et al 2000 ) .",
    "furthermore the range of densities present in the uv line emitting gas is difficult to determine .",
    "consequently a quantitative abundance determination of the type carried out in stellar photospheres , where the physical conditions are well - known , is not possible .",
    "hence it is impossible to rule out definitively a contrived spectrum and gas distribution which would produce the set ( i ) lines while suppressing the set ( ii ) lines .",
    "however as    *   set ( i ) and set ( ii ) ions require essentially identical ranges of @xmath30 *   the ionising spectrum of might be expected to favour civ relative to nv *   the lower metallicity expected for might be expected to boost the civ1550@xmath25 / nv 1240@xmath7 line ratio    by far the simplest explanation of our observed uv line spectra is that a substantial underabundance of carbon is present in the surface layers of the mass donor star in .    in xtej1118 + 480 ( as in ae aqr ) ,",
    "the underabundance of carbon compared to nitrogen strongly suggests that the material in the accretion flow is substantially cno processed ( clayton 1983 ) .",
    "if the cno bi  cycle achieves equilibrium , it converts most cno nuclei into @xmath33n . at the lower temperatures typical in @xmath34 ms stars ( which we shall suggest as the progenitor of the companion in xtej1118 + 480 ) this conversion is much more at the expense of @xmath35c than @xmath36o , and in fact @xmath37o increases .",
    "hence the oxygen abundance is not expected to decrease by much in xtej1118 + 480 and this argument does not of itself explain the observed weakness of ov 1371@xmath25 .",
    "however civ1550@xmath25 , nv 1240@xmath7 are resonance lines , whose ratio must be regarded as a robust indicator of conditions in the line emitting gas , whereas ov 1371@xmath38 is a subordinate line , which may not be formed efficiently in a low density photoionized gas .",
    "we thus regard the spectrum of xtej1118 + 480 as indicating cno processing .",
    "the spectrum shown in figure 1 implies that the companion star in must be partially nuclear  evolved and have lost its outer layers , exposing inner layers which have been mixed with cno  processed material from the central nuclear",
    " burning region .",
    "mass transfer must therefore have been initiated from a somewhat evolved and sufficiently massive donor of @xmath39 , and thus with an initial period @xmath40  hr . the main difficulty in understanding the current status of is to explain its observed short orbital period ; in general , significant nuclear evolution is associated with a period _ increase _ , rather than the inferred decrease .",
    "there are two ways in which this decrease could have occurred :    \\(i ) the system came into contact with initial secondary / primary mass ratio @xmath41 and underwent a phase of thermal  timescale mass transfer until @xmath42 . at the end of this phase",
    "the period would have either decreased or not increased greatly .",
    "subsequent orbital angular momentum loss could then pull the system in to the observed @xmath43  hr . this case is similar to the likely evolution of ae  aqr ( schenker et al . , 2002a ) .",
    "\\(ii ) the system came into contact with @xmath44 already , and subsequent evolution was driven by angular momentum loss towards shorter periods .",
    "this case resembles that proposed for a062000 by de kool et al ( 1983 ) , with a severe additional constraint : the donor must be sufficiently evolved to provide the observed surface abundance ratios .",
    "this requires a near  equality of the nuclear and orbital angular momentum loss timescales @xmath45 ( cf fig",
    ".  2 ) . put another way , @xmath46 must have been very close to the ` bifurcation period ' defined by pylyser & savonije ( 1988 ) .    case ( i ) above can be ruled out by the current system parameters . at the end of thermal timescale mass transfer",
    "we must have @xmath42 , which would require a donor mass @xmath47 and an orbital period @xmath1  hr .",
    "but for such a system @xmath48 ( cf fig .",
    "2 ) , implying evolution to _ longer _ periods , in stark contrast to the current 4.1  hr . put another way , there is an upper limit on the binary mass @xmath49 for case ( i ) evolution to give nuclear  evolved donors at short orbital periods .",
    "the near equality @xmath50 can only realistically hold if magnetic braking dominates angular momentum loss , so we require @xmath51 at the end of the thermal  timescale episode .",
    "but since @xmath52 there , we must have total binary mass @xmath53 in case ( i ) evolutions .",
    "we are therefore left only with case ( ii ) above .",
    "the secondary mass when the system came into contact is now constrained to be close to @xmath0 : cno processing excludes significantly lower masses , while the requirement for @xmath54 excludes significantly higher masses .",
    ", 4 show the evolution of such a system : a @xmath55 ms star was allowed to evolve and fill its roche lobe in a 15  hr binary with a @xmath56 bh .",
    "the predicted mass transfer rate throughout the evolution , including its current value @xmath57 , shows that the system would indeed have appeared as a soft x ",
    "ray transient , according to the irradiated  disc criterion for black  hole systems given by king , kolb & szuszkiewicz ( 1997 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the change in c / n is mostly due to a drastic depletion of @xmath35c , supplemented by a more modest increase in @xmath33n .",
    "the total o abundance at the surface has only decreased very little ; in fact the o / n ratio is reduced by only a factor of 3 to 5 at most , predominantly due to the increase of n. interestingly , this model also passes through @xmath58 at around @xmath59 , showing much weaker n enhancements ( i.e.   almost normal abundances , cf fig .",
    "thus it can also be considered a reasonable model for a062000 . a subsequent paper ( schenker et al . , 2002b )",
    "will explore this and related evolutions in detail .",
    "finally we can compare further properties of the secondary in our model to observations : figure 4 shows the evolution of effective temperature with orbital period , together with a simple mapping to spectral types .",
    "the procedure is based on a conversion of observed colours to spectral types ( beuermann et al . ,",
    "1998 ) and a set of non - grey stellar atmospheres ( hauschildt et al . , 1999 )",
    "providing the colours for each set of stellar boundary conditions . for solar metallicity",
    "the resulting spt turns out to be only a function of effective temperature with a very weak dependence on surface gravity .",
    "however this mapping should only be considered a first estimate , as the evolutionary code in its current form still uses grey atmospheres .",
    "furthermore the whole conversion is based on an observed set of unevolved stars and theoretical zams models , i.e.  no fully self - consistent application to a partially evolved ms star such as shown in fig .",
    "4 is possible for the time being .",
    "allowing for the uncertainties described above , our model may be slightly too cool ( m2 rather than k5-m1 as mentioned in mcclintock et al ( 2001 ) , or k7-m0 by wagner et al ( 2000 ) .",
    "similar evolutionary tracks of strongly evolved cvs are known to get hotter again ( baraffe & kolb , 2000 ) at short periods , so a confirmed secondary spectral type would provide insight as to the state of nuclear evolution in the donor star of .",
    "figure 4 shows that in any case that the donor will currently appear to be close to the zams , and thus that the distance estimate derived by mcclintock et al ( 2000 ) on this basis is likely to be quite good .",
    "we have compared the uv spectra of and xtej1859 + 226 .",
    "the former shows strong evidence of cno processing , which tightly constrains the evolution of the system .",
    "must have first reached contact with the donor star having a significantly nuclear  evolved core , at a period where nuclear and angular momentum loss timescales were comparable .",
    "this in turn constrains the end point of the earlier common ",
    "envelope phase : immediately after the common ",
    "envelope phase the system had a wide enough separation that significant nuclear evolution could occur before contact was achieved . in a future paper we will investigate such evolutions systematically .",
