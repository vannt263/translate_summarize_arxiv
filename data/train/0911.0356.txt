    "controversy on the invariance of integral quantities in decaying turbulence has aroused during the last years @xcite .",

    "the conservation of the loitsyanski integral @xmath3 for an initial spectrum @xmath4 was called to derive the classical energy decay rate @xmath5 and a growth of the integral length @xmath6 proportional to @xmath2 @xcite . in a similar fashion , for an initial spectrum @xmath7 , the assumed conservation of the integral quantity @xmath8 associated to the conservation of linear momentum leads to @xmath9 @xcite . in practice ,",
    "theses quantities were shown to be only approximately conserved in closures @xcite and in numerical simulations @xcite depending on the large scale spectrum of the initial conditions .",
    "less is known about the decay of turbulent flows in rotating reference frames .",
    "these flows have been largely studied due to its relevance for scientific and engineering problems .",
    "their importance has motivated numerous theoretical , experimental , and numerical works .",
    "applications are broad , including areas as diverse as turbo machinery and rotor - craft , convective region of the sun and stars , large - scale flows in oceans , and convective scales in the atmosphere .",
    "it is well known that solid - body rotation inhibits the non - linear direct cascade of energy toward small scales reducing the dissipation rate of kinetic energy in comparison with non - rotating flows .",
    "this reduced dissipation has been observed in simulations @xcite , experiments @xcite , and studied theoretically @xcite .",
    "an increase in the integral length parallel to the rotation axis with time has also been reported @xcite for these flows .",
    "resonant wave theory has been used to take into account the effect of rapid rotation in turbulence @xcite . according to this approach",
    ", the energy is transferred from small to large scales by resonant triadic interactions of inertial waves .",
    "the theory also argues that the resonant interactions are responsible for driving the flow to a quasi - two - dimensional state . in resemblance with the classic taylor - proudman theorem for steady flows @xcite , this result",
    "is often called the `` dynamic taylor - proudman theorem '' ( see eg .",
    "@xcite ) , and leads to the decoupling of slow modes which behave as an autonomous system of two - dimensional ( 2d ) modes for the horizontal velocity components ( perpendicular to the rotation axis ) for strong rotation @xcite .    as a result of this reduced non - linear coupling and dissipation , for decaying flows in the laboratory different scaling laws were observed as the flow decays @xcite , from classical non - rotating values at small times changing to different power laws after a time of the order of @xmath10 . in @xcite , for example , an initial isotropic decay is observed , followed by a cross - over for @xmath11 after which the energy decays slower ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "such a decay law was proposed by @xcite based on the assumption of energy tranfer being governed by the linear time @xmath13 .",
    "strong correlation of the vertical flow leading to the growth and subsequent saturation of the integral length by vertical confinement was observed in @xcite .",
    "this saturation was observed at a time proportional to @xmath14 in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite large - scale columnar - structure formation through linear inertial wave propagation was observed .",
    "large scales form columnar eddies aligned with the rotation axis and a linear growth of the axial integral length takes place once the rossby number passes below a certain threshold ( @xmath15 ) . with the increase of rotation ,",
    "energy is retained by stable large scale structures and prevented form cascading to small scales . in some cases ,",
    "energy was observed to decay faster for larger rotation frecuency .    in simulations , @xcite reported depletion of the nonlinear energy cascade and growth of anisotropy .",
    "also , an increase on the energy decay rate with rotation frequency was observed for the isotropic as well as the perpendicular modes .",
    "two - dimensionalization was reported in several works ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , together with the formation of columnar structures @xcite as seen in experiments . in @xcite ,",
    "three distinct regimes were observed depending on the rotation frecuency . at low rotation rates the flow behaves as non - rotating . at intermediate rotation rates ,",
    "a strong coupling between rotation and non - linear interactions dominates ( with a slower decay of the energy ) , and at high rotation rates viscous effects are dominant , damping the nonlinear effects .",
    "recently , the cases of helical and non - helical rotating decaying turbulence with the integral scale of the size of the box were numerically studied in @xcite , where it was found that the presence of net helicity decreases even further the decay rate of energy ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "rotating helicoidal flows have applications in atmospheric research , helical convective storms being an example @xcite .    to explain some of the experimental and numerical results , an extension to phenomenological predictions for rotating turbulence for @xmath7 and @xmath4 initial spectra ( usually known as saffman and batchelor spectra respectively ) has been proposed @xcite .",
    "it includes a slow - down factor of the energy flux due to the presence of rossby waves involving two different timescales : a long timescale representative of the turbulence evolution and a short one associated with the rotation frequency @xmath16 .",
    "conservation of @xmath8 and @xmath3 is then called to derive the asymptotic decay of energy for both initial spectra resulting in @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively . in the case of constrained turbulence",
    ", phenomenology leads to @xmath19 .",
    "however , these phenomenological arguments do not consider the effect of anisotropies in the integral conserved quantities or in the decay laws .    in this work we numerically study the decay of rotating helical and non - helical turbulence with an emphasis on the anisotropies that arise when rotation is present , and on how integral quantities may be modified .",

    "we consider as an example a non - rotating flow , which behaves in agreement with previous results . in sections 4 and 5",
    "we show and analyze results for the rotating non - helical and helical cases respectively . in the presence of rotation ,",
    "we observe a decoupling of the energy decay rates for the 2d and three - dimensional ( 3d ) modes . studying the low wave number behavior we propose that the conservation of two - dimensional integral moments may explain these decays . in section 6",
    "we finally summarize the results .",
    "the navier - stokes equation for an incompressible fluid in a rotating frame is solved numerically . when rotation is present , the equation reads    @xmath20    together with the incompressibility condition    @xmath21    here @xmath22 is the velocity field , @xmath23 is the vorticity , @xmath24 is the total modified pressure , @xmath25 is the ( unit ) density , and @xmath26 is the kinematic viscosity .",

    "we finally discuss briefly the effect of helicity upon the decay rate of energy in a rotating fluid . in order to incorporate net helicity into the flow we use a superposition of arnold - beltrami - childress ( abc ) @xcite initial conditions achieving an initial relative helicity @xmath149 . as in run 2 , the abc flows were added in all shells in fourier space between wave numbers @xmath150 to @xmath151 with an isotropic spectrum @xmath56 .",

    "indeed , in this run the integral scales grow fast during the transient and reach lengths close to the size of the box @xmath52 ( @xmath156 ) before the self - similar decay starts .",
