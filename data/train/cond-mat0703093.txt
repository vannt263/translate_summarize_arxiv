    "it is exactly tangible advances in structuring metals on nanoscales that give rise to a grate amount of experimental and theoretical works in the field of plasmonics , which examine resonance optic effects caused by surface plasmon polaritons ( spps ) excitation in structured conducting or semiconducting media@xcite .",
    "these quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) electrodynamic objects have been thoroughly studied in the solid state physics , physics of surfaces and diffraction optics over the late few decades@xcite .",
    "an spps are electromagnetic surface waves , coupled to the collective electron excitation , they attract a great deal of attention due to their unique possibility of light localization and essential enhancement of the electric field near the surface .",
    "a considerable interest in spps stems from the latest experiments on elt phenomena . since 1998 , after observation by ebbesen et.al.@xcite the violation of bethe s approach@xcite to the diffraction by subwavelength periodic hole arrays in real metal films , this has been the subject of many studies . until the recent moment one of the most generally recognized explanations of the elt through subwavelength periodic hole arrays is the excitation of spps .",
    "most of the authors ( especially theoreticians ) , who hold on to the spp conception of elt , assume that the field enhancement results from `` interface '' spps , being either single - boundary localized ( which is a common case for a nonsymmetric dielectric surrounding of the film ) or double - boundary localized for the symmetric surrounding .",
    "a periodic hole array plays a role of a coupler between the spps existing at the boundaries of the conducting film and the incident light . in this context",
    "the crucial point is the surface periodicity .",
    "the periodicity caused by other factors , such as corrugation or periodic modulation of the medium electromagnetic properties , etc . , also result in the light - matter interaction resonance features , in particular , the elt effect .",
    "note that comparing the elt transmittance peaks positions to those caused by spp excitation in different diffraction orders undoubtedly points out a significant spp role , see numerous experiments , e.g. refs .  .",
    "it should be noted that the observed elt effects are strongly dependent upon the film surrounding . as the film having the subwavelength hole array",
    "is surrounded by the dielectrics with the same dielectric constants ( for instance , a free - standing film ) the excited spps are double - boundary - localized , that is , the field is enhanced at both faces of the film , see experiments@xcite . in this geometry",
    "the elt in zeroth diffraction order is much more pronounced as compared to the nonsymmetrical film surrounding , when the excited spps are single - boundary - localized , that is the field can be enhanced at a single face of the film .",
    "generaly , this corresponds to the films deposited onto the quartz substrate .",
    "both of these cases have been so far studied by using numerical methods@xcite . it was also shown numerically and experimentally that the elt occurs for periodical conducting structures without holes .",
    "basically this is quite evident , since the type of periodicity does not play a crucial role for the excitation of the interface spps .",
    "these were chiefly the structures with relief corrugations of the film faces both for symmetrical@xcite and nonsymetrical@xcite dielectric surrounding and the structures with periodically - located dielectric pillars@xcite .",
    "several authors have developed an analytical approach which qualitatively describes the elt .",
    "they have studied the diffraction by the film with one - dimensional ( 1d ) periodically modulated dielectric permittivity@xcite . in these",
    "works a study has been made in the simplest case of a strictly normal incidence onto the symmetrically surrounded film with harmonic modulation of the film permittivity .",
    "the exception are the papers @xcite , where the theory is generalized to the nonsymmetric surrounding .",
    "the authors of these works have described the zeroth - order transmittance dependence upon the parameters in case of spp excitation in the first diffraction order .",
    "in contrast to them , in a certain sense , we have provided a more general analytical insight@xcite , by solving the problem of vector diffraction by the film with nonsymmetric and symmetric dielectric surrounding for arbitrary modulation fourier spectra of the permittivity of the metal at an arbitrary incident angle and at an arbitrary polarization of the incident light .",
    "the advantage of our analytical treatment is that we have described not only the first - order resonances , but have given a classification of the resonances corresponding to single or double - boundary - localized spps excitation in single or multiple diffraction orders .",
    "also , we have examined a nonzeroth - order elt that was observed in the experiments refs .  .",
    "mention also paper @xcite , where the alternative analytical approach was suggested to describe the light transmittance through metallic nanoslit structures .",
    "yet another important class of plasmonic structures possessing interesting diffraction resonance phenomena are metallic nanoparticle arrays@xcite .",
    "as known , they can support the so - called _ localized spp resonances _ which are strongly dependent upon the shape of the individual particles@xcite .",
    "it is believed that the _ shape resonances _ similar to the localized ones , may affect the elt in subwavelength hole arrays .",
    "the influence of the hole or / and nanoparticle shape was studied experimentally in@xcite .",
    "the study of the conducting films containing periodic lattices of dielectric nanoparticles and voids have been made in refs .  .",
    "however , we are not aware of the study on the experimental or theoretical optical properties of metallic nanoparticle arrays immersed into a conducting film . similarly to a nanohole array , such a nanoparticle array should display elt with the wavelength spectra depending strongly upon the nanoparticle shape .    in the present paper we go on investigating the resonance optical effects by generalizing the earlier developed analytical treatment@xcite of the conducting films with 2d modulation .",
    "we consider the vector diffraction problem for periodically located metallic inclusions in the metal film with an arbitrary dielectric surrounding . since the inclusions are presumed to be entirely imbedded into the film ( the faces of the film being flat ) , the resonances of our system correspond to the excitation of purely interface spps , the localized - spp resonances do not exist .",
    "along with the fact that such structures are of interest by themselves , they may be considered as a model of subwavelength hole arrays ; and the approach developed is appropriate for other periodical structures ( say , for corrugated films ) .",
    "one more substantial aspect of our approach is that we can easily describe the polarization of light transmitted or / and reflected by the 2d periodical structure .",
    "the polarization properties of subwavelength hole arrays is also a matter of interest , and they have been intensively studied in recent years@xcite .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . following the introduction , in section  [ sec : general ] ,",
    "we describe a general approach to the problem of resonance light diffraction by a 2d periodically - modulated conducting film for the conical mount case and for an arbitrary polarization of the incident light .",
    "we accentuate the fact that the form of the periodically - located inclusions have an impact upon the fourier spectra of the periodical structure and this , in its turn , influences the excited spps considerably . in section  [ sec : nonsymmetric ] we examine the excitation of single - boundary - localized spps in the nonsymmetrically - sandwiched film , considering both the entire transmittance and reflectance spectra and a more detailed analysis of different resonances in their close vicinity .",
    "we give an explanation of the recently observed polarization dependence upon the hole shape@xcite from the view point of fourier spectra of the periodical structure . besides , we compare our calculations with other recent experiments .",
    "section  [ sec : symmetric ] is devoted to the resonance effects caused by the excitation of double - boundary - localized spps in the symmetrically - sandwiched film .",
    "we study in detail the fine structure of the two - humped resonance maxima ( minima ) of the transmittance ( reflectance ) , stressing the role of long - range and short - range spps .",
    "as far as we know , the fine structure of two - humped resonances corresponding to the symmetrically surrounded film has not been studied thoroughly in experiments . in the appendix below",
    "we draw an analogy between the elt and the forced oscillations of a well - known classical system of two weakly coupled linear damping mechanical oscillators .",
    "the problem under consideration is of profound interest not only from the view point of a pure physics , but can find numerous applications in optical subwavelength devices design@xcite .",
    "for instance , recently , spp in sandwiched structures found itself as surface plasmon resonance optical sensors,@xcite and some of them are already commercially available .",
    "these sensors are based on the interaction between waveguide and spp modes .",
    "the basic feature of the sensors is measuring the refractive index variation in biological and chemical real - time high - definition sensing .",
    "it is important to mention that elt phenomena are studied in the microwave ( thz ) region of electromagnetic waves @xcite which attracts a great deal of attention .",

    "the eigenmodes of the film are initial spps , with the dispersion relation corresponding to the determinant of the matrix @xmath73 vanishing in zeroth order approximation in modulation .",

    "@xmath81 , with @xmath82 , and in calculating the matrix determinant @xmath57 ( in the lowest order in the modulation ) one has to take into consideration the products of the determinants of the diagonal in diffraction orders submatrices @xmath83 along with the terms corresponding to the submatrices @xmath84 , @xmath85.][comment1 ] then the initial spps existing at the boundary of the metal and dielectric half - space become coupled due to the finite film thickness , and one obtains the two double - boundary - localized ( db ) spp modes : long - range ( lr ) and short - range ( sr ) spps@xcite . for @xmath86 , and , respectively , @xmath87 , one finds from eq .",
    "the two roots , @xmath88 , @xmath89 that is the single - boundary localized modes coupled into double - boundary localized ones .",

    ", sr spp possesses higher ohmic losses .",
    "since the modulation is presumed to be small , the eigenmodes of the modulated film ( `` dressed '' modes ) differ slightly from those existing in the unmodulated film .",
    "the dispersion relation of the dressed spp modes defines the resonance conditions .",
    "however for identification of the resonance type the modulation can be neglected .",

    "the initial surface modes are coupled mainly through the finite film thickness and , in general , the corresponding dependencies of the reflectance / transmittance are of two - valley ( two - peak ) shape due to splitting of lr and sr modes .",
    "the explicit form of the resonance curve corresponding to lr ( sr ) spp resonances coincides with that given by eq .  , if one changes @xmath110 to @xmath111 [ @xmath112 in the designation of @xmath113 in eq .  .",
    "when db spps are related to different multiindexes ( _ multiple diffraction - order double - boundary resonance _ ) , which occurs under very specific conditions , they are coupled through periodicity and the finite film thickness simultaneously .",
    "now take up the solution of the system . in a small region of @xmath94 plane , which is of order of the resonance width ,",
    "the solution is strongly dependent upon the number of resonance curves passing through this region .",
    "hence it is convenient to subdivide the set of the diffraction orders into a resonance subset , @xmath114 , which contains the multiindexes relative to the above - mentioned curves , and a nonresonance subset , @xmath115 .",
    "thus , we subdivide the initial infinite system into the resonance subsystem containing the resonance tcs and the nonresonance subsystem containing the nonresonance tcs .",
    "the resonance tcs correspond to @xmath47-components of the tcs with the resonance multiindexes , and the nonresonance tcs correspond to @xmath48-components of amplitudes with the resonance multiindexes , @xmath116 , and both @xmath47- and @xmath48-components of tcs with nonresonance multiindexes , @xmath117 , @xmath118 .    in the main approximation@xcite , which assumes retaining the quadratic in modulation amplitude terms in the matrix elements , and the linear terms in the right - hand sides ,",

    "the zero - value of matrix @xmath129 determinant yields a dispersion relation of the spp modes in the film in the main approximation . as was discussed above , the block , @xmath130 , being diagonal relative to the diffraction order , contributes to the unperturbed dispersion relation .",
    "the nondiagonal , linear - in - modulation block , @xmath131 , contains the `` interresonance '' or `` coupling '' modulation harmonic , @xmath132 , which is chiefly responsible for the spp dispersion curve splitting , and for the appearance of the spectral band gap@xcite .",
    "the third term in is quadratic in modulation , and describes the second - order scattering processes which provide the broadening and the shift of the dispersion branches .    the nonresonance tcs , @xmath117 ,",
    "are expressed in terms of the resonance tcs as @xmath133 @xmath134 is a transmission ( for @xmath135 ) or a reflection ( for @xmath136 ) coefficient corresponding to @xmath47 ( for @xmath77 ) or @xmath48 ( for @xmath137 ) polarization in the case of an unmodulated film .",
    "@xmath48-components of the tcs with the resonance multiindexes , @xmath116 , are expressed in terms of @xmath47-components , @xmath138 , and are small as compared with the latter ; they are of no interest , and we do not present them herein . the diffraction efficiencies are @xmath139 from the energy conservation it evidently follows that @xmath140   = \\mathcal{p } \\ge 0 , \\ ] ] where @xmath141 is the absorbed part of the energy flux density .",
    "if a sertain point of @xmath142 plane belongs to one or two curves having a single multiindex @xmath143 ( for other parameters being fixed ) the vicinity of this point defines a single diffraction - order resonance .",
    "moreover , according to the above classification , in the case of one curve ( for a single @xmath50 ) , we have a sb resonance , and if the point is the intersection of two curves with different @xmath50 values , we have a db resonance .",

    "the resonance tcs have two poles . for a nonsymmetric surrounding ,",
    "these poles are releted to spps existing at the opposite film faces , while in the case of a symmetric surrounding , they are related to lr and sr spp modes .",
    "the structure of the resonance tcs indicates that the coupling strength between the incident wave and the spp excited is proportional to the scalar product of the spp and the incident wave magnetic fields .",
    "note that the spp magnetic field is orthogonal to its propagation direction and is parallel to the interface so that the spp is effectively excited by the projection of the tangential component of incident wave magnetic field onto @xmath151 ( or , alternatively , by the scalar product of tangential components of the electric spp fields and the incident wave ) . as for @xmath47(@xmath48)-polarization of the incident light ,",

    "the optimal amplitude is related to the maximal spp excitation and , consequently , to minimal / maximal value of reflectance / transmittance . in spite of the fact that we assume the modulation to be rather small ,",
    "let us make a rough astimation of the resonance width for the hole arrays . for ag films in the visible and near infra - red frequency region",
    "the impedance of the film is @xmath175 , while for the holes the impedance @xmath176 .",
    "therefore , @xmath177 , and @xmath178 . for wavelength of order",
    "@xmath179 the resonance width can be estimated as @xmath180 , which is in good qualitative agreement with numerous experimental results . in the experiments the resonance width is equally affected by the non - plane character of an input light wave and the finiteness of the periodic array .",
    "note that the resonance width is very important for problems of sub - diffraction - limited optical imaging ( optics of volume or surface `` superlenses '' ) .",
    "sufficiently broadened spp resonances may be efficiently used to enhance the evanescent modes and thus to recover the subwavelength information on nanoobjects , see ref .  .",
    "the approach developed allows one to consider the diffraction problem for the resonances of arbitrary multiplicity on 2d - periodical structures possessing an arbitrary symmetry .",
    "but from the experimental point of view the resonances of fourfold multiplicity , which take place for the normal incidence , @xmath181 , at the square and rectangular periodical arrays are of special interest . here , and in what follows , we will concentrate on the structures possessing @xmath182 symmetry : @xmath183 ; the geometrical symmetry ( brillouin zone symmetry ) is supposed to be @xmath184 , i.e. @xmath22 is perpendicular to @xmath23 and their modules are equal , @xmath185 . as it seen from eq .  , at normal incidence the multiple spp resonances arise at the wavelengths @xmath186 , where @xmath187 is the period of the structure .",
