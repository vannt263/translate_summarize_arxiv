    "b - tangent bundle @xcite , guillemin , miranda , and pires recover the correspondence of a non - degenerate poisson bi - vector and a symplectic form ; in this b - setting , a b - poisson bi - vector corresponds to what is called a b - symplectic form .",
    "this correspondence allows us to understand the slightly degenerate b - poisson structure using the language of symplectic geometry .",
    "much work has been done to obtain the counterparts of results from symplectic geometry in the b - setting and to compute familiar poisson invariants ; for instance see @xcite , or @xcite .",
    "our goal is to similarly study minimally degenerate poisson structures utilizing the tools of symplectic geometry .",
    "we desire a class of structures that is not overly restrictive so as to have a large class of examples , yet is restrictive enough to make the computation of poisson invariants tractable .",
    "the b - setting has its genesis in a compactification of a manifold with a cylindrical end in that the b - tangent bundle is a lie algebroid that extends the standard tangent bundle to this compactification .    * b - manifold *        _ a torus with a cylindrical end _",
    "there are several other naturally occurring geometries on spaces whose compactifications also lend themselves to this endeavor of finding a class of minimally degenerate poisson structures .",
    "we will discuss the scattering setting @xcite , a compactification of a manifold with a euclidean end , and the 0-setting @xcite , a compactification of a manifold with a hyperbolic - funnel end .    2 * sc - manifold *        _ a torus with a euclidean end _    * 0 - manifold *        _ a torus with a hyperbolic - funnel end _    in section 2",
    "we describe lie algebroids @xmath13 arising from this type of compactification , algebroids such as the b - tangent bundle , the 0-tangent bundle , and the sc - tangent bundle .",
    "an @xmath13-symplectic form on a manifold @xmath2 is a smooth form away from the boundary that extends to the lie algebroid @xmath13 in the compactification .",
    "sometimes there is a rich symplectic theory for a given algebroid @xmath13 , as has been the case for the b - tangent bundle .",
    "however , not all algebroids will admit a symplectic form ; we show that there are no 0-symplectic structures on manifolds of dimension greater than 2 .    on the other hand ,",
    "as we will show , a robust theory does exist for the sc - tangent bundle .",
    "for example , scattering - symplectic geometry includes the study of the standard euclidean symplectic form at infinity . to be precise ,",
    "let @xmath14 be the standard coordinates on @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath16 be the radial coordinate and away from the origin let @xmath17 . then in coordinates @xmath18 , @xmath19 the standard symplectic form is expressible as @xmath20 where @xmath21 defines the standard contact structure on @xmath22 .",
    "we compactify @xmath15 with a sphere at infinity given by the zero set of @xmath23 .",
    "this compactified space equipped with @xmath24 is an example of a scattering - symplectic manifold ( with boundary ) .",
    "in fact , any scattering - symplectic form @xmath24 on any manifold @xmath2 will define a contact structure on the singular locus of @xmath24 .",
    "accordingly , scattering - symplectic geometry not only gives us an approach to studying poisson geometry , but contact geometry as well .",
    "additionally , scattering - symplectic geometry provides a way to recontextualize established results . in 1997 , peter kronheimer and tomasz mrowka @xcite adapted the construction of the seiberg - witten invariants to the situation of a 4-manifold @xmath25 with contact boundary @xmath26 . to do this they construct a space @xmath27 that is the union of @xmath25 with a cylinder @xmath28 by identifying @xmath26 with the closed end of the cylinder @xmath29 . given a contact form @xmath30 on @xmath26 ,",
    "they define a symplectic form @xmath31 on @xmath32 by the formula @xmath33 this cylinder naturally compactifies to a scattering - symplectic manifold with boundary .",
    "we identify @xmath34 $ ] with @xmath35 $ ] by mapping @xmath36 and @xmath31 is expressible as the scattering - symplectic form @xmath37 as a form on the sc - tangent bundle , this extends non - degenerately to @xmath38 .    the purpose of this paper is to introduce scattering - symplectic geometry and to demonstrate how this context can give new insights in symplectic , contact , and poisson geometry . in the following subsections we give an account of select results .      because every closed symplectic manifold has non - trivial degree 2 de rham cohomology group , the only sphere that admits a symplectic structure is the 2 dimensional sphere @xmath39 .",
    "an immediate question when expanding the notion of symplectic is to look for these structures on spheres .    every even dimensional sphere @xmath40 admits a scattering symplectic structure @xmath24 such that the equator @xmath22 is the singular hypersurface and @xmath24 induces the standard contact structure on @xmath22 .",
    "one very natural context that provides a generalized symplectic structure on spheres is folded symplectic geometry .",
    "richard melrose @xcite , by defining folded contact structures , introduced a particular idea of minimally degenerate differential form .",
    "building on @xcite , ana cannas da silva , victor guillemin , and christopher woodward @xcite define a folded symplectic manifold @xmath41 to be a @xmath1-dimensional manifold @xmath2 equipped with a closed two - form @xmath24 that is non - degenerate except on a hypersurface @xmath4 where there exist coordinates such that locally @xmath5 and @xmath42    by allowing this very mild degeneracy , all even dimensional spheres admit a folded symplectic structure .",
    "folded symplectic geometry is similar in spirit to our main object of study ( or to @xmath13-symplectic structures ) .",
    "one significant difference is that @xmath13-symplectic structures correspond to classical minimally - degenerate poisson structures .",
    "the inverse of the morphism @xmath43 ( where it is invertible ) for a folded symplectic form does not extend to define a poisson structure on the entire manifold .    unfortunately , there are no b - poisson spheres in dimensions greater than two : ioan mrcut , and boris osorno torres @xcite showed that a compact @xmath44-symplectic manifold @xmath45 of dimension @xmath1 has a class @xmath46 in @xmath47 such that @xmath48 is nonzero in @xmath49 .",
    "recall that a symplectic manifold @xmath50 is a strong symplectic filling of a contact manifold @xmath51 if @xmath4 is the boundary of @xmath2 and near @xmath4 there is a liouville vector field @xmath52 transverse to @xmath4 with @xmath53 defining the contact structure @xmath54 such that @xmath55 .",
    "these fillings come in two flavors : _ convex _ means the liouville vector field @xmath52 points outward at the boundary @xmath4 and _ concave _ means @xmath52 points inward at the boundary .    in order to glue two strong symplectic fillings along a common contact boundary to form a symplectic manifold ,",
    "one side must be a concave filling and the other must be convex . in this paper , we demonstrate a natural way to expand the symplectic category to allow gluings of convex to convex and concave to concave fillings .    given two strong convex symplectic fillings of a contact manifold , their union over @xmath4 admits a scattering symplectic structure that coincides with the existing symplectic structures away from @xmath4",
    ".    given two strong concave symplectic fillings of a contact manifold , their union over @xmath4 admits a folded symplectic structure that coincides with the existing symplectic structures away from @xmath4 .        on the left we glue convex to convex to produce a scattering    symplectic union . on the right ,",
    "concave to concave gives a    folded symplectic union .",
    "we can use this theorem to construct many examples of scattering - symplectic manifolds , see section [ gluingsection ] .",
    "for instance , @xmath56 is scattering - symplectic with singular hypersurface three torus @xmath57 .",
    "we also have that @xmath58 is scattering - symplectic with singular hypersurface @xmath59 .",
    "while many scattering symplectic manifolds arise in this way , not all such structures can be obtained by gluing two strong convex fillings , see proposition [ notfill ] .",
    "the poisson bi - vector determines a differential on multi - vector fields .",
    "this complex @xmath60 is the lichnerowicz complex and its homology groups are poisson cohomology .",
    "poisson cohomology is an important invariant in the study of poisson structures .",
    "unfortunately , the computation of poisson cohomology is quite difficult in general and explicit results are known in only very select cases @xcite .",
    "the simplest case is that of a symplectic manifold , where the poisson bi - vector @xmath3 is non - degenerate and the poisson cohomology is isomorphic to the de rham cohomology .",
    "the non - degeneracy of @xmath3 allows us to define an isomorphism    @xmath61    that intertwines the respective differentials .",
    "this induces an isomorphism of complexes ,    @xmath62    by realizing a poisson bi - vector as the dual of an @xmath13-symplectic form , we will have a similar ismorphism of complexes @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a subcomplex of the standard lichnerowicz complex consisting of @xmath13-multivector fields and @xmath65 is the lie algebroid cohomology of @xmath13 .",
    "however , in general the homology of these complexes does not compute the poisson cohomology . in order to compute the poisson cohomology of a scattering - symplectic manifold , we develop and present a new way of computing poisson cohomology for this type of minimally degenerate poisson structure inspired by this isomorphism . in certain cases of a poisson manifold @xmath7",
    ", we can use @xmath3 to define an isomorphism ,    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is a lie algebroid called the _ _ rigged _ _ algebroid .",
    "this map intertwines the differential of the ( usual ) lichnerowicz complex and the differential of the de rham complex of @xmath67 , and thus induces an isomorphism of complexes    @xmath68    that allows us to use lie algebroid cohomology to compute poisson cohomology .",
    "we use this method to compute two cases , the first being of a scattering - symplectic manifold . for simplicity ,",
    "we state the result here using a fixed tubular neighborhood of @xmath4 .",
    "an invariant version can be found in theorem [ scpoissoncohom ] .    given a contact structure @xmath54 on @xmath4 ,",
    "let @xmath69 and let @xmath70 be a contact form on @xmath4 such that @xmath71 .",

    "<S> this paper will demonstrate the potential of the scattering symplectic setting . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we construct scattering - symplectic spheres and scattering symplectic gluings between strong convex symplectic fillings of a contact manifold . by giving an explicit computation of the poisson cohomology of a scattering symplectic manifold </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce a new method of computing poisson cohomology and apply it to @xmath0-symplectic manifolds . </S>"
