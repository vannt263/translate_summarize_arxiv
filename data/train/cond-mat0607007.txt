    "during last decades , current states in wide superconducting films in the absence of external magnetic and microwave fields have been studied in considerable detail .",
    "the main property of wide films , which distinguishes them from narrow channels , is an inhomogeneous distribution of the transport current over the film width .",
    "this distribution is characterized by increase in the current density towards the film edges due to the meissner screening of the current - induced magnetic field .",
    "it should be emphasized that the current state of a wide film is qualitatively different from the meissner state of a bulk current - carrying superconductor , despite their seeming resemblance .",
    "indeed , whereas the transport current in the bulk superconductor flows only within a thin surface layer and vanishes exponentially at the distance of the london penetration depth @xmath0 from the surface , the current in the wide film is distributed over its width @xmath1 more uniformly , according to the approximate power - like law @xmath2^{-1/2}$ ] @xcite , where @xmath3 is the transversal coordinate .",
    "thus the characteristic length @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the film thickness ) , which is commonly referred to as the penetration depth of the perpendicular magnetic field , has nothing to do with any spatial scale of the current decay with the distance from the edges .",
    "in fact , the quantity @xmath6 plays the role of a `` cutoff factor '' in the above - mentioned law of the current distribution at the distances @xmath7 from the film edges and thereby determines the magnitude of the edge current density . in films",
    "whose width is much larger than @xmath6 and the coherence length @xmath8 , the edge current density approaches the value @xmath9 @xcite if the total current @xmath10 does not exceed the homogeneous pair - breaking current @xmath11 .",
    "in such an inhomogeneous situation , the mechanism of superconductivity breaking by the transport current differs from homogeneous ginzburg - landau ( gl ) pair - breaking in narrow channels . in wide films this mechanism",
    "is associated with disappearance of the edge barrier for the vortex entry into the film when the current density at the film edges approaches the value of the order of the gl pair - breaking current density @xmath12 @xcite . using a qualitative estimate of @xmath13 for the current density which suppresses the edge barrier ,",
    "one thus derives the expression @xmath14 for the critical current of a wide film .",
    "this equation imposes a linear temperature dependence of the critical current , @xmath15 , near the critical temperature @xmath16 , and it is widely used in analysis of experimental data ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . a quantitative theory of the resistive states of wide films by aslamazov and lempitskiy ( al ) @xcite also predicts the linear temperature dependence of @xmath17 but gives the magnitude of the critical current larger by a factor of @xmath18 than the above estimate of @xmath17 .",
    "this result was supported by recent experiments on the critical current in wide films @xcite .",
    "since the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath6 infinitely grow while the temperature approaches @xmath16 , any film reveals the features of a narrow channel in the immediate vicinity of @xmath16 ; in particular , its critical current is due to the uniform pair - breaking ( narrow channel regime ) thus showing the temperature dependence of the gl pair - breaking current @xmath19 .",
    "as the temperature decreases , the film exhibits a crossover to an essentially inhomogeneous current state , in which vortex nucleation is responsible for the resistive transition ; in what follows , this regime will be referred to as a wide film regime .",
    "a following quantitative criterion of such a crossover was formulated in @xcite on the basis of careful measurements : if the temperature @xmath20 satisfies an implicit condition @xmath21 , the superconducting film can be treated as a narrow channel , whereas at @xmath22 it behaves as a wide film .",
    "the physical interpretation of this criterion is quite simple : existence of the resistive vortex state requires at least two opposite vortices ( vortex and anti - vortex ) , with the diameter @xmath23 each , to be placed across the film of the width @xmath1 . at the same time , it was noted in @xcite that after entering the wide film regime , the dependence @xmath24 , typical for narrow channels , still holds within a rather wide temperature range , though the absolute value of @xmath17 is lower than the pair - breaking current @xmath25 . in practice , the linear temperature dependence @xcite of the critical current becomes apparent only at low enough temperatures , when @xmath6 becomes 1020 times smaller than the film width .",
    "whereas the equilibrium critical current of wide films has been quite well studied , an interesting question about current states in the films under nonequilibrium conditions was much less investigated . in recent papers",
    "@xcite it was first reported that wide superconducting films , similar to short bridges @xcite and narrow channels @xcite , exhibit increase in the critical current under microwave irradiation ( superconductivity enhancement ) . in this paper , we present results of systematic investigations of the enhanced critical current in wide superconducting films .",
    "we argue that all essential features of the enhancement effect in wide films with an inhomogeneous current distribution are very similar to that observed before in narrow channels @xcite .",
    "we found that microwave irradiation stabilizes the current state in respect to the vortex nucleation and thus considerably extends the temperature region of the narrow channel regime .",
    "the relative moderateness of the current inhomogeneity in wide films enables us to exploit the theory of the superconductivity stimulation in spatially homogeneous systems with minor modifications for a quantitative treatment of our experimental data .",
    "the theory of superconductivity enhancement under microwave irradiation was created by eliashberg @xcite for superconducting systems , in which the equilibrium energy gap @xmath26 and the superconducting current density @xmath27 are distributed homogeneously over the sample cross - section .",
    "the theory applies to rather narrow and thin films [ @xmath28 with the homogeneous spatial distribution of the microwave power and , correspondingly , of the enhanced gap .",
    "the length of electron scattering by impurities , @xmath29 , is assumed to be small compared to the coherence length . according to this theory ,",
    "the effect of the microwave irradiation on the energy gap @xmath26 of a superconductor carrying the transport current with the density @xmath27 is described by the generalized gl equation , @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the density of states at the fermi level , @xmath32 is the diffusion coefficient , @xmath33 is the fermi velocity , and @xmath34 is a nonequilibrium term arising from the nonequilibrium addition to the electron distribution function @xcite , @xmath35,\\nonumber \\\\",

    "thus , in order to compare our experimental data with the eliashberg theory , we should express the superconducting current density @xmath27 through the function of the energy gap , temperature and irradiation power , using and ,    @xmath41 ^{1/2 } , \\\\",

    "when using equation for the quantity @xmath50 with the density of states given by the free electron model , @xmath51 , in calculation of the equilibrium critical current , we faced with a considerable discrepancy of with experimental values of @xmath25 .",
    "this implies that such an estimate of @xmath31 for the metal ( sn ) used in our experiments is rather rough .",
    "the way to overcome such an inconsistency is to express @xmath31 through the experimentally measured quantity , viz . ,",
    "film resistance per square , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the total film resistance at @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the film length .",
    "then equation transforms to the relation @xmath56 which provides good agreement of equation with both the experimental values of equilibrium pair - breaking current and the values calculated through the microscopic parameters of the film , @xmath57 and @xmath58 [ see below ] .    curiously , as far as we know",
    ", the temperature dependences of the enhanced critical current following from have been never quantitatively compared with experimental data .",
    "however , qualitative attempts of a comparison of the experimental dependences @xmath59 with the eliashberg theory have been done .",
    "for instance , the authors of @xcite interpreted their experimental results on the enhancement effect in narrow films in a following way .",
    "first , using the relation for the equilibrium gap , they presented the gl pair - breaking current as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the magnetic flux quantum .",
    "then , using an empiric fact that the temperature dependence of the enhanced critical current in the narrow film is close to the equilibrium one , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is a superconducting transition temperature in a microwave field , this dependence was modelled by equation similar to , @xmath64 the enhanced energy gap @xmath65 in was calculated by the eliashberg theory for zero superconducting current [ equation at @xmath66 .",
    "assuming @xmath67 and using the magnitude of the microwave power as a fitting parameter , the authors of @xcite eventually achieved good enough agreement between the calculated and measured values of @xmath59 .",
    "obviously , such a comparison of the experimental data with the eliashberg theory should be considered as a qualitative approximation which can not be used to obtain quantitative results .",
    "first , equations and involve the gap value at zero current ( @xmath68 ) which is different from that with the current applied .",
    "second , the pair - breaking curve @xmath69 in the equilibrium state , which is implicitly assumed in , significantly differs from that in the microwave field @xcite .",
    "of course , such model assumptions might nevertheless give a relatively good numerical approximation to a right formula ( actually , that is what has been used in @xcite ) , yet the basic inconsistency of such an approximation is due to qualitatively different behaviour of @xmath59 and @xmath65 in the vicinity of the critical temperature . indeed , as the temperature approaches @xmath63 , the enhanced order parameter @xmath65 approaches a finite ( though small ) value , @xmath70 , and vanishes through a jump at @xmath71 @xcite , whereas the critical current vanishes continuously , without any jump .",
    "thus , the temperature dependence of the critical current can not in principle be adequately described by equation of type ; incidentally , this can be seen from a pronounced deviation of the formula from the experimental points in a close vicinity of @xmath16 . in the present paper ,",
    "the experimental data will be analyzed by means of the exact formula , in which the numerical solution of equation for the quantity @xmath72 is used .",

    "this implies that the current density at the film edges approaches a value of the order of @xmath12 and thereby indicates the absence of the edge defects which might produce local reduction of the edge barrier to the vortex entry and corresponding decrease in @xmath17 . while measuring the @xmath10-@xmath73 curves ( ivc ) , the samples were placed in a double screen of annealed permalloy .",

    "qualitative similarity of the results with those obtained for the narrow channels @xcite and the possibility to quantitatively describe the temperature dependence @xmath113 by the equations of the eliashberg theory convince us that the mechanism of the enhancement effect is the same for the wide films and the narrow channels , i.e. , it consists in enhancement of the energy gap caused by a redistribution of the microwave excited nonequilibrium quasiparticles to higher energies @xcite .",
    "this conclusion seems to be not quite evident for the wide films with inhomogeneous current distribution across the sample because it is the current inhomogeneity that may be suggested to completely suppress the superconductivity stimulation in bulk superconductors .",
    "indeed , in the latter case , the concentration of the transport current and the microwave field within the meissner layer near the metal surface gives rise to an extra mechanism of quasiparticle relaxation , namely , spatial diffusion of the microwave excited nonequilibrium quasiparticles from the surface to the equilibrium bulk .",
    "the efficiency of this mechanism is determined by the time of quasiparticle escape , @xmath149 , from the meissner layer , which is three - to - four orders of magnitude smaller than typical inelastic relaxation time .",
    "such high efficiency of the diffusion relaxation mechanism is likely to result in the suppression of the enhancement effect in bulk superconductors .",
    "however , relying upon a qualitative difference between the current states in bulk and thin - film superconductors outlined in introduction , one can argue that moderate non - uniformity of the current distribution in wide films ( with no concentration of an exciting factor at short distances ) causes no fatal consequences for the enhancement effect , and that the diffusion of nonequilibrium quasiparticles excited within the whole bulk of the film introduces only insignificant quantitative deviations from the eliashberg theory .    in our consideration",
    ", we used a model approach to take these deviations into account by introducing the numerical form - factor of the current distribution into the formula for the enhanced critical current .",
    "we evaluate this form - factor by fitting the limit form of equation at zero microwave power , i.e. , equation , to the measured values of the equilibrium critical current .",
    "then we apply obtained values of the form - factor 0.83 for snw10 and 0.57 for snw8 to equation at @xmath150 , which results in a considerably good fit to the experimental data , as demonstrated in previous section .",
    "there is a question worth to discuss how the eliashberg mechanism works in the regime of a wide film , i.e. , when the superconductivity breaking is due to the vortex nucleation rather than due to exceeding the maximum value allowed by the pair - breaking curve by the transport current .",
    "we believe that in this case the enhancement of the energy gap results in corresponding growth of the edge barrier for the vortex entry , and this is what enhances the critical current in the wide film regime .",
    "it is interesting to note that no essential features appear in the curves @xmath87 when the films enter the vortex resistivity regime . from this",
    "we conclude that the transition between the regimes of the uniform pair - breaking and vortex resistivity has no effect on both the magnitude and the temperature dependence of the critical current .    to complete with the discussion of the superconductivity enhancement effect , we draw one s attention to the empiric fact that all the fitting curves for @xmath59 obtained by equations of the eliashberg theory are excellently approximated by the power law @xmath151 .",
    "this law is quite similar to the temperature dependence of the gl pair - breaking current , in which the critical temperature @xmath16 is replaced by its enhanced value @xmath63 .",
    "explicit expressions for such approximating dependencies , with numerical coefficients , are presented in captions to the figures [ ff ] and [ fff ] .",
    "the next important result of our studies is the essential extension of the temperature range of the narrow channel regime of wide films on enhancement of superconductivity : in the microwave field , the temperature of the crossover to the wide film regime , @xmath122 , considerably decreases as compared with its equilibrium value , @xmath110 . in the first glance",
    ", this result somewhat contradicts the criterion of the transition between the different regimes mentioned in introduction , @xmath152 , because increasing energy gap under irradiation implies decreasing magnitude of @xmath153 and , correspondingly , decreasing characteristic size of the vortices .",
    "this obviously facilitates the conditions of the vortex entry to the film , thus the crossover temperature should _ increase _ in the microwave field .",
    "we believe , however , that there exists a more powerful stabilizing effect of irradiation on the vortices .",
    "the role of this effect is to delay the vortex nucleation and/or motion and to maintain the existence of the narrow channel regime down to low enough temperatures at which the current inhomogeneity eventually becomes well developed .",
    "indeed , for the sample snw10 at zero microwave power , the transition to the wide film regime occurs at the temperature @xmath154 _ higher _ than the temperature @xmath115 at which the deviation of @xmath155 from the gl uniform pair - breaking current begins to be observed .",
    "this means that in equilibrium case the vortex nucleation begins at relatively small inhomogeneity which still weakly affects the magnitude of the critical current .",
    "in contrast to this , under microwave irradiation of the frequency @xmath106  ghz , the vortex resistivity occurs at the temperature @xmath156 _ lower _ than @xmath115 , i.e. , the inhomogeneous current state shows enhanced stability with respect to the vortex nucleation in the presence of a microwave power .",
    "similar conclusion can be drawn regarding the behaviour of the critical current in the wider film snw8 .",
    "we suggest the following qualitative explanation of the stabilization effect .",
    "since the dimensions of the samples are small compared to the electromagnetic wavelength ( the sample length is @xmath157 m and the minimum wavelength is @xmath158 m ) , we deal , in fact , with an alternating high - frequency current , @xmath159 , flowing through the sample .",
    "the relative power @xmath160 , corresponding to the maximum enhanced current @xmath59 , is rather high , therefore the amplitude of @xmath161 may be comparable with the magnitude of the critical transport current .",
    "this results in a considerable modulation of the net current flow through the sample which presumably enhances the stability of the current flow with respect to the nucleation and motion of the vortices .",
    "a possible analogy of such phenomenon is given by stabilization of the current state in narrow channels at supercritical currents caused by self - radiation of phase - slip centers @xcite .    as noted in previous section ,",
    "the stabilizing effect becomes more pronounced with increasing irradiation frequency @xmath162 : the region of the narrow channel regime considerably extends as the frequency grows . in the framework of our assumption about the stabilizing role of the high - frequency modulation of the current flow , such effect can be explained as follows .",
    "the relative microwave power of optimum enhancement , @xmath163 , was found to increase with @xmath162 @xcite , while the critical power @xmath164 changes with @xmath162 only at small enough frequencies , @xmath165 @xcite , where @xmath166 is the inverse of the gap relaxation time and does not exceed @xmath167  ghz for our samples and temperatures . at larger frequencies used in our experiments ,",
    "@xmath164 holds a constant value , which enables us to attribute the variations in @xmath163 to variations in the absolute magnitude of the irradiation power @xmath37 , i.e. , in the amplitude of the modulating high - frequency current @xmath161 .",
    "thus the increase in the irradiation frequency causes the microwave power of optimum enhancement of superconductivity to increase and , correspondingly , the stabilizing effect of the electromagnetic field on the vortices to enhance .",
    "the results of our investigation enable us to conclude that the mechanism of superconductivity enhancement by a microwave field is the same for both the narrow channels and wide films ",
    "this is the eliashberg mechanism of enhancement of the superconducting energy gap caused by the excitation of nonequilibrium quasiparticles to a high energy region within the whole bulk of a superconductor . in the vicinity of @xmath16 , where any film can be treated as a narrow channel",
    ", the eliashberg mechanism enhances the critical current in a usual way , through modification of the pair - breaking curve for the superconducting current . at lower temperatures ,",
    "when the wide film enters the regime of the vortex resistivity , the enhancement of the critical current is likely associated with the growth of the edge barrier to the vortex entry , nevertheless giving the magnitude and the temperature dependence of the critical current quite similar to that in the previous case .",
    "such similarity extends down to low enough temperatures , at which a linear temperature dependence predicted for extremely wide films is observed .",
    "another important effect of the microwave irradiation is to stabilize the current state of the film in respect to the entry of the vortices , presumably by deep modulation of the transport current by the induced high - frequency current .",
    "this results in the extension of the temperature range in which the film behaves as a narrow channel , showing no vortex resistivity in the current - voltage characteristic .",
    "the stabilizing effect grows with frequency which is explained by simultaneous increase in the pumping power and , correspondingly , in the amplitude of the high - frequency current .",
    "we achieve good accordance of the experimental data with eliashberg theory by introducing a numerical form - factor into equations initially derived for homogeneous distribution . despite the simplicity and high enough quality of such approximation",
    ", this problem requires a more consistent approach , involving solution of diffusive equations of nonequilibrium superconductivity in a spatially inhomogeneous case .",

    "<S> the temperature dependences of the enhanced critical current in wide and thin sn films exposed to the microwave field have been investigated experimentally and analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that the microwave field stabilizes the current state of a wide film with respect to the entry of abrikosov vortices . </S>",
    "<S> the stabilizing effect of irradiation increases with frequency . using similarity between the effects of microwave enhancement of superconductivity observed for homogeneous ( narrow films ) and inhomogeneous ( wide films ) distributions of the superconducting current over the film width </S>",
