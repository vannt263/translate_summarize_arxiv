    "several proposals have also been made whereby multi - frequency entangled outputs are generated .",
    "these rely on the use of non - degenerate downconversion @xcite or cascaded or concurrent nonlinear optical processes @xcite where the tripartite entanglement is instead produced via the interaction with the nonlinear medium itself .",
    "it is these concurrent processes that we consider in this work for the quadripartite case .    in regards to quadripartite entangled beams",

    "this can then be interpreted as a set of @xmath66-number sdes .",
    "it should be noted that the use of the positive-@xmath65 representation , rather than the glauber - sudarshan p representation @xcite , is necessary to ensure that the diffusion matrix of the fpe is positive - definite .",
    "this is achieved with the positive - p approach by defining two independent stochastic fields @xmath67 and @xmath68 corresponding to the mode operators @xmath13 and @xmath69 , respectively , in the limit of a large number of stochastic trajectories . using this method",
    "it is possible to calculate stochastic trajectory averages which correspond to the normally - ordered expectation values of quantum - mechanical operators , for example , @xmath70 . taking this approach yields a diffusion matrix of the form ,    @xmath71    where @xmath72 is an 8 @xmath73 8 null matrix and the non zero block",

    "the @xmath62 are the cavity loss rates at the respective frequencies , and @xmath79 are real , independent , gaussian noise terms which satisfy @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "it should be mentioned that we are assuming that all the intracavity modes are resonant with the cavity , and although it is possible to include detuning we do not do so here .",
    "we conduct a linearized fluctuation analysis @xcite of the system for the purposes of calculating the output spectral correlations for the cavity from the intracavity spectra .",
    "we begin by neglecting the noise terms in equation  ( [ posp ] ) so that @xmath83 , and also set @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is a mean value and @xmath86 represents the fluctuations .",
    "this gives a set of classical equations for the mean values ,    @xmath87    and from these we can obtain steady - state solutions .    in the remainder of this paper we consider a symmetric system where all the high frequency modes have the same cavity damping rates , with @xmath88 for @xmath89 and all low frequency modes also have equal cavity damping rates , with @xmath90 for @xmath91 .",
    "in addition to this , we assume all the nonlinearities and hence all the pump field amplitudes are equal , that is , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .    for this completely symmetric system",
    ", we verify that there is an oscillation threshold at the critical pumping amplitude ,    @xmath94    as is the case for triply concurrent downconversion @xcite .",
    "this result differs from the standard non - degenerate opo threshold condition by a factor of a half .",
    "this difference here is due to the fact that each pump mode drives two down - conversion processes .",
    "the stationary solutions below this threshold value are found to be ,    @xmath95    whilst , above threshold the stationary solutions are given by ,    @xmath96    @xmath97    we see that the low frequency modes become macroscopically occupied as the pumping is increased and the high frequency modes remain at their threshold value . using equations  [ posp1 ] and  [ posp ] we also perform dynamical simulations to confirm the steady state values .",
    "we then proceed to study fluctuations around the steady state which allows one to calculate measurable output fluctuation spectra @xcite and hence , quantify the quantum correlations of the system .",
    "the linearized equations for the fluctuations are of the form ,    @xmath98    where @xmath99^{t}$ ] , @xmath100 is the noise matrix of equation  [ posp ] with the steady - state values inserted , @xmath101 is a vector of independent , real wiener increments @xcite and @xmath102 is the drift matrix with the steady - state values inserted and given by ,    @xmath103    where @xmath104 ,    @xmath105    and    @xmath106    provided the eigenvalues of the drift matrix @xmath102 have no negative real part the system is stable and we can treat the fluctuation equations as describing an ornstein - uhlenbeck process @xcite .",
    "this allows one to calculate the intracavity spectral correlation matrix ,    @xmath107    and this is related to the measurable output fluctuation spectra using the standard input - output relations for optical cavities @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it supplies us with all that is necessary to calculate the measurable extracavity quadripartite entanglement .",
    "the same inequalities as given in section  [ iii ] in terms of variances also hold when expressed in terms of the output spectra , and it is these quantities that can be measured in experiments . in the following ,",
    "we use the notation @xmath108 ( ie .",
    "any of @xmath109 ) to represent the three output spectral correlations of the same form as the optimized expressions in eqns .",

    "[ fig1 ] , we plot these three correlations as a function of frequency for our completely symmetric system for the below threshold case ( solid line ) and the above threshold case ( dashed line ) . in both cases , the three correlations are equal , ie . @xmath110 .",
    "the inequalities are violated both below and above the threshold , demonstrating quadripartite entanglement . specifically , the results shown are for the case of the pump field amplitudes set at @xmath111 and @xmath112 . for these parameter choices , the largest violation of the van loock - furusawa entanglement criteria , and thus the maximum quadripartite entanglement ,",
    "is for the low frequency modes below threshold . in general , for both cases the largest degree of violation of the inequalities is observed near zero frequency . for large frequencies",
    "@xmath113 which is the uncorrelated limit for our optimized expressions .    , as a function of frequency @xmath114 ( units of @xmath115 ) corresponding to the quadripartite entanglement criteria given in equation 21 - 23 .",

    "the three correlations are equal for each case for the chosen parameters , which are symmetric with @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "all quantities plotted here and in the subsequent graph are dimensionless . ]",
    "we also determine the maximum quadripartite entanglement for the same parameters as in figure  [ fig1 ] , but for a range of pump field amplitudes on both sides of the oscillation threshold .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig2 ] , where we plot the minimum value of the output spectra at any frequency , as a function of @xmath119 .",
    "as expected @xcite , we observe the maximum quadripartite entanglement at the critical pumping amplitude , with the caveat that the linearized fluctuation analysis is not valid in the immediate vicinity of the threshold .",
    "the fact that a gradual slope is observed below threshold in the region of maximum entanglement could prove useful for future experimental realizations of this scheme .",
    "it is also found that quadripartite entanglement persists well above threshold , with a large violation of the van loock - furusawa criteria still present as the pumping is increased above the critical pumping value . in particular , well above threshold the minimum of @xmath108 approaches 3 .",
    "this behaviour is also seen in @xcite where the equivalent correlations also asymptote to a finite value .    , with @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "again , all three correlations are equal for these parameters .",
    "it should be stressed that at @xmath120 the validity of the results is limited as the linearized analysis is no longer valid . ]",
    "we have demonstrated intracavity continous - variable quadripartite entanglement in quadruply concurrent downconversion , both above and below the critical pumping threshold using optimized van loock - furusawa criteria . above threshold",
    "the proposed scheme produces a source of bright entangled output beams .",
    "the below threshold regime provides the greatest degree of entanglement and a region where this entanglement could be measured in experiments .",
    "one of the advantages of this type of scheme lies in the number of different regimes that can be explored by tuning various parameters in experiments .",
    "for example , the pump intensities and coupling strengths can be tuned and this makes it possible to vary the degree of entanglement in the system .    throughout this article",
    ", we have studied the properties of the interaction hamiltonian , presented the full quantum equations of motion and performed a linearized fluctuation analysis .",
    "all results indicate that this system is a good candidate for the demonstration of quadripartite continuous - variable entanglement . in relation to experimental implementation of the scheme presented here , stabilizing a single cavity in which four entangled modes are created may prove preferable in some applications rather than alternative schemes which rely on stabilizing and synchronizing multiple opos .",
    "finally , this result could be of further significance in a similar system where one of the nonlinear couplings is absent .",
    "such a system may be a candidate for realizing the simplest four node cluster state @xcite .",
