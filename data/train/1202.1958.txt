    "2011 ) aim to map large areas of the sky ( @xmath4 1000 sq degrees ) to very deep levels ( 5@xmath5 50 @xmath1jy ) with the purpose of addressing a number of key astrophysical questions .",
    "specifically they aim to constrain the cosmic star - formation history of the universe out to z@xmath32 , to map the evolution of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) to the edge of the universe and to probe the influence of postulated agn feedback mechanisms on star - formation activity and the formation and evolution of galaxies ( norris et al .",
    "the wide - field and source density of these surveys may be particularly suited to cosmological studies ( e.g. raccanelli et al .",
    "2011 ) . on the other hand , smaller area surveys with the emerlin ( muxlow 2010 ) , evla ( e.g. myers et al . 2010 ) and the future meerkat mightee surveys ( jarvis 2011 ) will push to much deeper flux densities ( @xmath6jy rms ) to obtain a clear census of activity in the universe up to higher redshifts , traditionally thought of as the realm of rest - frame optical and ultra - violet surveys . as radio observations",
    "are unaffected by dust extinction they have the potential to provide a dust - unbiased probe of the accretion and star - formation history of the universe at these redshifts .    at flux densities greater than a few mjy radio surveys",
    "detect almost exclusively radio - loud agn whereas at lower flux density levels an increasing fraction of the radio source population is identified with star - forming galaxies .",
    "the relative fraction of agn and star - forming galaxies present at these low flux densities is not well - determined but observational studies and extrapolations of the radio luminosity functions of both populations indicate that agn constitute a significant fraction ( up to 50% ) of the radio source population even at levels of ten s of @xmath1jy ( sadler et al . 2002 ; jarvis & rawlings 2004 ; simpson et al .",
    "2006 ; seymour et al . 2008 ; kellermann et al . 2008 ; padovani et al . 2009 ; 2011 ) .",
    "thus there is no observational regime in which one can assume a faint radio source is simply associated with a starburst galaxy , and complementary datasets at optical and infrared wavelengths will play a vital role in classifying these faint radio sources . furthermore ,",
    "optical and near - infrared imaging are crucial for providing estimates of a radio source redshift through photometric redshift techniques or through follow - up spectroscopy at the position of the optical / near - infrared counterpart .",
    "attaining the scientific goals of future deep continuum surveys is thus largely dependent on the ability to identify the correct multi - wavelength counterparts to the faint radio sources .",
    "identifying the counterparts to a large fraction of higher redshift radio sources will require very deep complementary multiwavelength datasets .",
    "given the resolution of these planned radio surveys , 10  arcsec for emu , 15  arcsec for wodan , it is possible that this necessary increase in depth of complementary datasets will complicate the cross - identification process .",
    "the resolution and signal to noise ratio of the radio observations determines a lower limit on the positional accuracy of the faint radio source positions dictating that the true counterparts might be located anywhere within this positional uncertainty .",
    "however the higher source density of the deeper complementary data creates an increased probability of both multiple counterparts and spurious alignments being detected within these large search radii , rendering nearest neighbour matching techniques unreliable .",
    "a method which is often used to identify counterparts to low resolution radio observations is the likelihood ratio ( lr ) technique .",
    "this technique was first developed by richter ( 1975 ) and later expanded upon by de ruiter et al .",
    "( 1977 ) ; sutherland & saunders ( 1992 ) and ciliegi et al .",
    "the method combines information about the brightness distribution of the complementary higher resolution data and the positional errors in both the radio source catalogue and the complementary dataset to determine the most likely counterpart .",
    "it is thus of interest to determine how this more sophisticated matching technique will perform in the proposed case of low resolution ( @xmath410 arcsec ) radio observations matched to high resolution very deep infrared and optical catalogues . to investigate this question",
    "this paper will degrade the positional accuracy of a set of deep radio observations taken with 6 arcsec resolution and produce a number of simulated catalogues whose positional accuracies are consistent with observations taken at 10 arcsec and 15 arcsec resolution .",
    "we use a lr analysis , similar to that in smith et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , to determine reliable near - infrared ( nir ) counterparts to both the original catalogue and the simulated ` low resolution ' catalogues and compare the results .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : sections 2 and 3 outline the radio and infrared observations used in the matching procedure .",
    "section 4 gives the details of the lr technique used for matching , section 5 explains the procedure used to simulate the low resolution catalogue and section 6 gives the results of the comparison .",
    "section 7 summarises the effects of blended radio sources and our conclusions are presented in section 8 .",
    "all magnitudes are quoted in the ab magnitude system .",
    "we assume that @xmath7=70  km.s@xmath8.mpc@xmath8 and a @xmath9=0.3 and @xmath10=0.7 cosmology throughout this paper .",
    "the radio survey used in this analysis consists of very large array ( vla ) observations at 1.4  ghz undertaken by bondi et al .",
    "these observations were used to produce a mosaic image with nearly uniform noise of @xmath317  @xmath1jy over 1 square degree centred at @xmath11(j2000)=@xmath12 and @xmath13(j2000)=@xmath14 .",
    "they were taken in the vla b - configuration and have a fwhm synthesised beamwidth of approximately 6  arcsec .",
    "a catalogue of radio sources was extracted from the mosaiced image using the aips ( greisen 2003 ) search and destroy ( sad ) task , retaining only sources with a peak flux to local noise ratio of @xmath15 .",
    "this procedure resulted in a catalogue of 1054 radio sources whose peak flux densities exceed 60  @xmath1jy .",
    "of these 1054 sources 19 are identified as multiple component radio sources .",
    "radio sources are identified as multiple component sources if their individual components meet the following three criteria , the components are separated by @xmath16  18  arcsec , have peak flux ratios @xmath16  3 , and all components have a peak flux @xmath0  0.4  mjy / beam .",
    "further details of the calibration , catalogue extraction and multi - component classification procedures are outlined in bondi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .    for the purpose of evaluating the performance of the lr technique we disregard the multiple component radio sources in the catalogue as the lr relies on knowledge of the expected position of the infrared counterpart source and the associated errors on this position , and both of these quantities",
    "are poorly determined in the case of multiple component radio sources .",
    "we also exclude single component radio sources whose morphologies are asymmetric or elongated as the position of the potential counterpart source is not well known in these cases .",
    "these criteria result in the exclusion of a further 3 radio sources from our input catalogue .",
    "we acknowledge that such sources will be important components of future wide - area radio surveys , however they are not key to the work presented here .",
    "the square degree of vla radio observations has been observed with the vista deep extragalactic observations ( video ; jarvis et al . in prep . )",
    "the video survey is a 12 sq .",
    "degree survey over three fields with the visible and infrared survey telescope for astronomy ( vista ) and is designed to investigate the formation and evolution of galaxies and galaxy clusters .",
    "the survey provides photometry in the @xmath17,@xmath18,@xmath19,@xmath20 , @xmath21 bands to 5@xmath22 depths of 25.7 , 24.6 , 24.5 , 24.0 , 23.5 magnitudes ( 2  arcsec diameter apertures ) respectively .",
    "this field also coincides with the canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls ) d1 field which provides additional photometry in the @xmath23,@xmath24,@xmath25,@xmath26,@xmath27 optical bands .    to minimize the number of spurious faint sources in the combined catalogue used for cross - matching we retain only those sources with @xmath28 ( petrosian magnitude ) .",
    "we also disregard radio sources whose counterparts are affected by the presence of nearby saturated stars in the infrared images .    as infrared photometry to the depths of the video survey will not be available for several years across the 1000 s of square degrees surveyed by future radio continuum surveys it is of interest to determine the likely completeness achieved when cross - matching these large radio surveys against infrared surveys with similarly large sky coverage .",
    "one of the largest near - infrared surveys currently being undertaken is the vista hemisphere survey ( vhs ) which is surveying the entire southern hemisphere to a 5@xmath22 depth of @xmath29=20.0 .",
    "the vhs thus represents one of the deepest complementary datasets covering the entire survey area of the wide - field emu survey .",
    "we investigate the completeness that cross - matching to this survey will produce by performing a lr cross - match to our video catalogue limited to detections with @xmath30  20.0      to remove contaminating stars from the combined nir / optical catalogue , which are unlikely to be genuinely associated with radio sources , we employ a colour based criteria similar to that used by baldry et al .",
    "( 2010 ) in their star - galaxy separation algorithm for target selection in the gama survey . to achieve this separation we fit the stellar locus in ( @xmath19-@xmath31)@xmath32 versus ( @xmath33-@xmath34)@xmath32 colour space with a quadratic @xmath35 given by :",
    "@xmath36    objects are removed from our cross - matching catalogue if their colours meet the criteria:@xmath37 figure [ fig : sgsep ] illustrates the fit to the stellar locus and the separation criteria used .",
    "another method to achieve star - galaxy classification is to determine how well an object is resolved in the optical / nir image , with stars and quasars being unresolved .",
    "object detection and photometry for the video survey was achieved using sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) ; full details of the extraction will be given in jarvis et al .",
    "( in prep . ) .",
    "this package uses a neural network to assess how well resolved an object is and thereby determines a likelihood that the object is a star or galaxy .",
    "this likelihood is expressed as a class_star estimate between 0 and 1.0 with stars having measurements close to 1.0 and galaxies close to zero .",
    "an inspection of these class_star estimates reveal that the total contribution of stars to the video catalogue after implementing our colour threshold is @xmath165% .",
    "we chose to use the criteria in equation [ eqn : locus ] rather than a straightforward class_star cut to avoid removing quasars , which are also unresolved in optical images and may be genuine counterparts to the radio sources .",
    "however it should be noted that the criteria in equation [ eqn : locus ] also removes a small number of quasars from our final nir catalogue .",
    "the likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probability that a given source and counterpart are related to the probability that they are unrelated .",
    "it is given by the relationship ( sutherland & saunders 1992 ) : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the radial probability distribution function of the offsets between the radio and infrared positions , @xmath40 is the expected distribution of the true infrared counterparts as a function of @xmath41-band magnitude and @xmath42 is the magnitude distribution of the full catalogue of @xmath21-band detected objects .",
    "the radial probability distribution @xmath39 is given by a gaussian:@xmath43 where @xmath44 is the offset between the radio and infrared position and @xmath45 is the combined positional error of the radio and infrared sources .     and",
    "the error estimates used in our lr analysis @xmath46 based on the relationships in ivison et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . ]    positional errors of radio sources can be ascribed to two independent sources of error , calibration errors and noiselike errors ( condon et al .",
    "calibration errors are independent of source strength and are best estimated by a comparison with external , more accurate data .",
    "in contrast , the noiselike contribution to positional errors is a function of the signal to noise ratio of the detection and is thus the dominant contributor to the positional errors of sources detected at low signal to noise .",
    "the noiselike positional errors of radio sources are usually estimated from the models of condon ( 1997 ) for the propagation of errors in 2-dimensional gaussian fits in the presence of gaussian noise .",
    "however in recent work ivison et al .",
    "( 2007 ) derived a simplified expression for the positional errors due to the gaussian fits in the special instance of all the radio sources being unresolved by the symmetric beam .",
    "in this instance the positional errors can be described by the following equation : @xmath47 with snr being the signal to noise ratio of the detected source .",
    "we adopt this simplified description of the expected positional errors in our derivation of the @xmath45 .",
    "the final positional errors should also include an estimate of the calibration error term . as there are no other radio catalogues over this area of better positional accuracy with which to make a comparison , bondi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) chose to estimate the calibration error term by comparing the position of the sources in the final mosaiced image with their positions in the images of the single vla pointings .",
    "they find on the basis of this comparison that these calibration errors are of the order of 0.1  arcsec .",
    "thus we adopt as the expected positional error : @xmath48    we justify this simplified description of the errors based on figure [ fig : offset1 ] which presents a comparison of these simplified estimates with those predicted by the method of condon ( 1997 ) and demonstrates that they are in reasonable agreement . furthermore to account for the possibility that the radio and observed - frame @xmath21 band emission may not arise at exactly the same position in the galaxy we impose the restriction that @xmath49  0.5 arcsec .",
    "the @xmath42 term of the likelihood ratio is estimated from the source counts of the input video catalogue normalised to the area of the survey .",
    "the most difficult term to estimate in the lr is @xmath40 , the magnitude distribution of the true counterparts to the radio sources .",
    "this distribution is estimated using the method outlined in ciliegi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) which begins by calculating the magnitude distribution of all the possible counterparts within a fixed search radius @xmath50 of the radio positions .",
    "this distribution is referred to as @xmath51 .",
    "the contribution due to the background source counts is subtracted from @xmath51 to produce a magnitude distribution of the excess infrared sources detected around the radio positions , designated as real(m ) .",
    "thus @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the total number of radio sources in the input catalogue .",
    "the @xmath40 distribution is derived from real(@xmath54 ) by normalising real(@xmath54 ) and scaling it by a factor @xmath55 , where @xmath55 is an estimate of the fraction of radio sources with infrared counterparts above the magnitude limit of the video survey .",
    "hence:@xmath56     and @xmath40 calculated by the lr in our cross - matching procedure .",
    "]    the @xmath55 term is usually estimated by determining the fraction of sources with radio counterparts above the background as follows : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the number of possible counterparts within @xmath50 of the radio positions .",
    "however in the case of a large @xmath50 we find that this expression leads to an overprediction of the @xmath55 value as a result of a large number of excess sources in the search radii above the predicted background source counts .",
    "this effect may result from the tendency for radio - loud agn to favour denser environments than normal galaxies ( best et al .",
    "2005 ; falder et al .",
    "2010 ) , resulting in a large number of close neighbours for these sources . to overcome this difficulty we use the method developed by fleuren et al .",
    "( submitted ) to estimate @xmath55 .",
    "this method determines the number of sources in the radio catalogue which have no nir counterparts within search radius r of the radio positions as a function of the size of the search radius .",
    "this function @xmath59 is compared to @xmath60 which is the number of sources with no nir counterparts within search radius r when considering an input catalogue with the same number of sources as our original radio catalogue but with sources placed at random positions in the field of view .",
    "fleuren et al .",
    "demonstrate that the @xmath59 and @xmath60 quantites can be related to @xmath55 via the following equation : @xmath61    where : @xmath62    thus we determine q@xmath63 via a fit to the observed ratio of u@xmath64 to u@xmath65 .",
    "we present a comparison of the q@xmath63 estimates produced by the two methods in table  [ tab : q0 ] and adopt the estimates produced by the fleuren et al .",
    "method in our lr matching procedures at all resolutions .",

    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the initial simulated component list consisted of 1908 components with @xmath66  50  @xmath1jy , these are reduced to 1579 , 1557 and 1531 detected sources of which 283 , 299 and 325 detections are blended sources in the 6 , 10 and 15 arcsec catalogues respectively . as the lr is not designed to account for the possibility of two or more counterparts per radio source it is reasonable to assume that sources which consist of a blend of unrelated radio galaxies will not be reliably associated with an appropriate counterpart .",
    "the total contribution of these unrelated blends increases from 1.4  per  cent at 6  arcsec resolution to 2.3 and 4.0  per  cent at 10 and 15  arcsec resolutions respectively .",
    "thus we conclude that the contribution of this effect to incompleteness in any lr based cross - matching routine in future surveys will be small , at the level of approximately 1@xmath32.5  per  cent .",
    "the real contribution of this effect will depend on the baseline distribution and uv coverage of the survey in question .",
    "we do not attempt to estimate to what extent the blended multiple component radio sources will contribute towards incompleteness when cross - matching as the symmetric nature of the skads simulation radio sources will not allow us to realistically determine to what extent the positions of the final blended radio sources will deviate from the expected position of the nir counterpart .",
    "although in this paper we have concentrated on our ability to cross - match radio continuum sources from surveys such as those proposed for askap and apertif , it is clear that similar techniques may also be appropriate for much deeper ( @xmath67  njy ) and narrower surveys such as the meerkat international giga - hertz tiered extragalactic exploration ( mightee ) survey ( jarvis 2011 ) .",
    "although we currently do not have the necessary data to test how well we can recover counterparts to the radio sources at these depths , it is clear that our ability to identify shorter wavelength counterparts becomes worse towards fainter flux densities ( e.g. figure  [ fig : completezoom ] ) due to both the declining signal - to - noise and increasing density of counterpart sources .",
    "however resolution of the radio maps is also a contributing factor .",
    "the issue of spatial resolution will only become more difficult to deal with at deeper flux densities due to the edging closer to the classical confusion level of @xmath325 beams per source(condon 1974 ) .",
    "the current design of meerkat , incorporating 20  km maximum baselines , will provide a spatial resolution of @xmath68  arcsec at 1.4  ghz which for a 10@xmath1jy flux - density limit corresponds to @xmath69  beams per source according to the simulated skies of wilman et al .",
    "thus as we approach the new parameter space in flux - density and survey area offered by meerkat , and eventually the ska , the crucial aspect of telescope design will be how to achieve @xmath70  arcsec resolution coupled with high surface brightness sensitivity .",
    "we have presented a comparison of the infrared counterparts identified by the lr technique to radio sources observed with synthesized beamwidths of 6 , 10 and 15  arcsec resolution when matched against a nir catalogue at depths of @xmath71  22.6 and 20.0 .",
    "the results of our analysis indicate that we are able to reliably associate nearly all the available radio source counterparts in the nir catalogue , limited to @xmath72  22.6 , with the appropriate radio source .",
    "furthermore @xmath393 and 88  per  cent of the identifications made by this technique remain unchanged when matching the lower resolution 10 and 15  arcsec catalogues to the deeper nir catalogue . at all resolutions the technique delivers a catalogue with a high degree of completeness and a low percentage of contaminating misidentified sources . when matching against the shallower nir catalogue the fraction of unchanged counterparts increases to 97 and 94  per  cent in the 10 and 15  arcsec cases .    although changes in completeness and contamination fractions in our study were all relatively small as a function of resolution it is clear that both of these quality indicators degrade systematically as the depth of the matching complementary data increases and the resolution of the radio data decreases .",
    "we conducted a brief investigation into the question of unrelated radio sources being blended together at lower resolutions and reducing the completeness achieved by the lr cross - matching technique .",
    "we conclude that at a flux density limits of @xmath350  @xmath1jy , comparable to the emu wide - field survey , the contribution of this effect is likely to be small at the level of only a few percent .",
    "finally the distribution of photometric redshifts in our matched catalogues indicates that a significant fraction of the radio sources at z@xmath41.2 will not be detected in the shallower wide - field vista hemisphere survey .",
