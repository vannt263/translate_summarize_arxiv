    "sliding friction is one of the oldest problems in physics , and has undoubtedly a huge practical importance@xcite . in recent years",
    ", the ability to produce durable low - friction surfaces and lubricants has become an important factor in the miniaturization of moving components in technologically advanced devices . for such applications",
    ", the interest is focused on the stability under pressure of thin lubricant films , since the complete squeeze - out of the lubricant from an interface may give rise to cold - welded junctions , resulting in high friction and catastrophically large wear .",
    "it has been shown both experimentally and theoretically that when simple fluids ( quasi - spherical molecules and linear hydrocarbons ) are confined between atomically flat surfaces at microscopic separations , the behavior of the lubricant is mainly determined by its interaction with the solids that induce layering in the perpendicular direction @xcite .",
    "the thinning of the lubrication film under applied pressure occurs step - wise , by expulsion of individual layers .",
    "these layering transitions appear to be thermally activated @xcite . under strong confinement conditions ,",
    "some lubricant fluids become solid - like @xcite .",
    "other fluids , notably water @xcite , remain liquid - like up to the last layer that can be removed upon squeezing .",
    "this is related to the expansion of water upon freezing.@xcite , and should also hold for other liquids which expand upon freezing .",
    "the phenomenology of layering transitions in 2d - solid - like boundary lubrication has been studied in ref .",
    "it has been shown in a series of computer simulations that for solid - like layers , the layering transitions are sometimes initiated by a disordering transition , after which the lubricant behaves in a liquid - like manner for the rest of the squeeze - out process .",
    "since the typical lateral extension in surface force apparatus ( sfa ) experiments is of order 10 - 100 @xmath5 m ( much greater than atomic dimensions ) , it is reasonable to expect that _ during the layering transition _ the squeeze - out can be described in the framework of 2d continuum fluid mechanics .    for the first time",
    "such squeeze - out layering transitions were quite recently observed in a chain alcohol , c@xmath6h@xmath7oh ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , by imaging the lateral variation of the gap between the two anvil surfaces as a function of time .",
    "these experiments addressed the @xmath8 transition .",
    "more recently , in a refined experimental setup , mugele et al .",
    "@xcite were able to image several layering transitions ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) of the silicon oil omcts ( spherical molecule , diameter @xmath11  ) in great detail .",
    "the basic theory of 2d squeeze - out dynamics was outlined in ref .",
    "initially the system is trapped in a meta - stable state at the initial film thickness .",
    "squeeze - out starts by a thermally activated nucleation process in which a density fluctuation forms a small hole , of critical radius @xmath12  .",
    "once formed , a 2d pressure difference @xmath13 develops between the boundary line separating the squeezed out region from the rest of the system , and the outer ( roughly circular ) boundary line of the contact area , thus driving out the rest of the 2d fluid .",
    "the origin of @xmath13 is the elastic relaxation of the confining solids at the boundary line as is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ p0 ] .",
    "all earlier analytical studies of squeeze out have assumed that the lubricant behaves as an _ incompressible _",
    "2d liquid .",
    "while that assumption is quite good for many practical situations , recent computer simulations@xcite have shown that , at least at high squeezing pressures , strong density fluctuations may occur in the lubrication film .",
    "for example , in ref .  @xcite it was found that during the layering transition @xmath14 , while islands of ( temporarily ) trapped bilayer ( @xmath15 ) were removed by being squeezed into the monolayer , the density of the monolayer film was much higher in the region close to the trapped @xmath15 islands than further away .",
    "this resulted in a 2d pressure gradient in the film which induced a flow of the lubricant molecules away from the trapped islands .",
    "this kind of situations clearly calls for a consideration of the finite compressibility of the film .    in this paper",
    "we study the dynamics of the expulsion of the last liquid monolayer of molecules confined between two surfaces by solving the two - dimensional ( 2d ) navier - stokes equation for a _",
    "compressible _ liquid monolayer .",
    "we find that the squeeze - out is characterized by the parameter @xmath16 , where @xmath1 is the average perpendicular ( squeezing ) pressure , @xmath2 the liquid ( 3d ) density and @xmath3 the longitudinal sound velocity in the monolayer film . when @xmath4 the 2d liquid can be considered as incompressible , in which case the results of the earlier treatment are reproduced .",
    "we present numerical results for the squeeze - out time , and for the time - dependence of the radius of the squeezed - out region , for several values of the parameter @xmath17 .",
    "the main changes due to compressibility occur right at the onset of the squeeze - out process , and just before its completion .",
    "we assume the lubricant film to be in a 2d - liquid - like state , and the squeeze - out to be described by the 2d navier - stokes equations .",
    "for a compressible 2d liquid these equations take the form @xmath18",
    "@xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the local 2d mass density and the velocity of the fluid , @xmath23 is the 2d - pressure , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are viscosities . the last term in ( 2 ) , i.  e.  @xmath26 , describes the drag force acting on the fluid as it slides relatively to the solid walls.@xcite the magnitude of the friction also depends on the nature of the solid walls , e.  g.  on the amplitude of the atomic corrugation and on the structure of the solid walls ( amorphous vs.  crystalline , commensurate vs.  incommensurate ) . as long as the lubricant can be considered as a 2d fluid , as in the recent squeeze out experiments by mugele et al . , all the details of the solid walls are properly taken into account by the friction coefficient @xmath27 . in principle @xmath27",
    "depends on the normal pressure too , but in the measurements of mugele et al .",
    "this dependence is slight enough that it appears to be negligible@xcite .",
    "simple dimensional arguments ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) show that one can usually neglect the nonlinear and the viscosity terms in ( 2 ) , and that one can also assume the velocity field to change so slowly that the time derivative term can be neglected too .",
    "thus , @xmath28 in what follows we will assume that the squeeze - out nucleated in the center ( @xmath29 ) of the contact area , and spread circularly towards the periphery .",
    "the 2d - pressure @xmath23 at the outer boundary @xmath30 of the contact area takes the constant value @xmath31 ( the spreading pressure ) while it takes a higher value @xmath32 at the inner boundary towards the @xmath33 area ( fig .",
    "in fact , if @xmath34 is the perpendicular pressure acting in the contact area , then @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the thickness of the monolayer ( see ref .",
    "we may in most practical applications assume a hertz contact pressure @xmath37 finally , in order to have a complete set of equations we must specify the relation between the 2d pressure @xmath23 and the 2d density @xmath38 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath39 where the compressibility is @xmath40 , @xmath3 being the longitudinal 2d sound velocity .",
    "here @xmath41 is the 2d lubricant density at the periphery @xmath30 of the contact area .",
    "writing the velocity field as @xmath42 , equations ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) takes the form @xmath43 @xmath44 using ( 5 ) the last equation takes the form @xmath45 combining ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) gives @xmath46 the density @xmath38 satisfies the boundary conditions @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the equation for the inner boundary line . finally , we note that the velocity @xmath50 of the 2d - liquid at the inner boundary @xmath49 must equal the radial velocity @xmath51 of the boundary line .",
    "thus , if we put @xmath49 and @xmath52 in ( 7 ) we get @xmath53 let us at this point introduce dimensionless variables .",
    "if we measure the radius @xmath54 in units of @xmath55 , time @xmath56 in units of @xmath57 and density @xmath38 in units of @xmath41 we get    @xmath58    and the boundary conditions becomes @xmath59 @xmath60 and @xmath61\\dot r_1\\eqno(15)\\ ] ] where @xmath62 if we assume that @xmath34 is of the hertz form , then @xmath63 ^ 2\\right ) ^{1/2}\\eqno(17)\\ ] ] where @xmath64 thus , the theory depends only on a single parameter @xmath17 .",
    "note that @xmath65 , where @xmath2 is the 3d density of the liquid , and with the typical values @xmath66 and @xmath67 we get @xmath68 . in the experimental studies by mugele and salmeron ( as well as in most other surface force apparatus studies ) the average squeezing pressure @xmath69 which implies that the liquid can be considered as incompressible and the theory developed elsewhere can be used@xcite .",
    "however , in many practical situations the pressure @xmath1 might be similar to the yield stress of the solids which for metals is typically of order @xmath70 . in these cases it is necessary to include the finite compressibility of the lubricant in order to accurately describe the squeeze - out dynamics . in sec .",
    "iii we shall present numerical results based on the above equations for a range of values of the parameter @xmath17 .    let us first calculate the squeeze - out time in the limit when the compressibility @xmath71 .",
    "in this limit , all the adsorbates from the region @xmath72 will be piled - up right at the boundary line @xmath73 .",
    "if we consider a small angular section @xmath74 then the driving force acting on the boundary line is @xmath75 = r_1 \\delta \\phi p(r_1 ) a$ ] .",
    "this must balance the frictional drag force which is @xmath76 where the number of adsorbates @xmath77 .",
    "thus we get @xmath78 assume first that @xmath79 is constant .",
    "thus , ( 19 ) gives @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the squeeze out time for an incompressible 2d fluid , see ref .",
    "@xcite . integrating ( 20 ) gives @xmath82 so that the squeeze - out time , @xmath83 , in the limit @xmath71 is the same as for an incompressible 2d - fluid , @xmath84 .",
    "this suggests that the squeeze - out time is _ independent _ of the compressibility of the 2d - liquid , which our numerical simulations presented below indeed show to be the case .",
    "next , let us assume that the perpendicular pressure is of the hertz form , appropriate for a fluid between curved surfaces . in that case",
    "( 19 ) gives @xmath85^{1/2}\\ ] ] or , with @xmath86 , @xmath87 performing the integral gives @xmath88^{1/2 } = 1- { 3t\\over 4t}\\ ] ] thus , the squeeze - out time for the hertzian contact pressure is @xmath89 , and the time dependence of @xmath90 is given by @xmath91 or @xmath92 the squeeze - out time for an incompressible fluid with a hertzian contact pressure is @xmath93 which is a factor @xmath94 smaller than for the @xmath71 limiting case .",
    "thus , for a hertzian contact pressure the squeeze - out time does depend on the compressibility of the 2d lubrication film .",
    "we consider first the case of a spatially constant squeezing pressure , @xmath95 , appropriate for a fluid between flat surfaces . in this case",
    "numerical calculations show that the squeeze - out time is independent of the compressibility , i.e. , independent of the parameter @xmath17 . however",
    ", the time dependence of the squeeze - out radius @xmath90 does depend on @xmath17 . in fig .",
    "[ r1.t](a ) we show this time dependence for four cases , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 . in fig .",
    "[ r1.t](b ) we show the adsorbate density profile at the time point when the squeeze - out radius @xmath100 , for the same four @xmath17-values as in ( a ) .",
    "let us now assume the hertzian squeezing pressure profile , @xmath101 .",
    "in this case the squeeze - out time depends on the compressibility , increasing from @xmath102 to @xmath103 as the compressibility increases from @xmath104 to @xmath105 . in fig .",
    "[ time.g0 ] we show the squeeze - out time as a function of @xmath17 . in fig .",

    "[ r1.t.hertz](b ) we show the adsorbate density profile at the time point when the squeeze - out radius @xmath100 , for the same four @xmath17-values as in ( a ) .",
    "the results of fig .",
    "[ r1.t ] and fig .",
    "[ r1.t.hertz ] show that a compressibility parameter @xmath17 as small as 0.2 should produce a measurable difference in the squeeze - out evolution at all times .",
    "the main effect of compressibility appears at the beginning and at the end of the squeeze - out process .",
    "initially , compressibility favors piling up of fluid at the squeeze - out boundary , which can as a result expand more rapidly , compared with the case of an incompressible fluid . on the other hand ,",
    "when the hole approaches the boundary of the contact region , the squeezing - out speed of the compressed fluid is smaller , due to its increased density and , consequently , friction . in the case of uniform squeezing pressure",
    "these two effects compensate exactly , leading to a total squeeze - out time independent of the compressibility . for a hertzian pressure distribution ,",
    "the squeeze - out time instead increases with increasing compressibility : the initial speed up is overcompensated by the enhanced friction at the periphery of the contact area .",
    "the continuum mechanics theory of squeeze - out has been solved numerically for a 2d _ compressible _ liquid .",
    "we considered both a constant normal stress , and a hertzian normal stress , and assumed a centro - symmetric squeeze - out .",
    "we found that the squeeze - out is completely characterized by the compressibility parameter @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the average perpendicular squeezing pressure , @xmath2 the ( 3d ) liquid density and @xmath3 the longitudinal sound velocity in the monolayer film . when @xmath4 the 2d liquid can be considered incompressible , and the earlier results are reproduced .",
    "we presented numerical results for the squeeze - out time , and for the time dependence of the squeeze - out radius , for a grid of values of the parameter @xmath17 . for a constant squeezing pressure , the squeeze - out time",
    "was found to be _ independent _ of the compressibility parameter @xmath17 , while for a hertzian contact pressure it increased slightly with increasing @xmath17 .",
    "it is hoped that these theoretical results will soon be submitted to experimental check .",
