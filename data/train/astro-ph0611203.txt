    "star formation has long been known to occur primarily in the spiral arms of disc galaxies ( baade 1963 ) .",
    "spiral arms are denoted by the presence of young stars , hii regions , dust and giant molecular clouds , all signatures of the star formation process ( elmegreen & elmegreen  1983 ; ferguson 1998 ) .",
    "what is still unclear is the exact role of the spiral arms in inducing the star formation .",
    "is it simply that the higher surface density due to the orbit crossing is sufficient to initiate star formation , as in a schmidt law , or do the spiral arms play a more active role ? roberts ( 1969 ) first suggested that the spiral shock that occurs as the gas flows through the potential minima triggers the star formation process in spiral galaxies .",
    "shock dissipation of excess kinetic energy can result in the formation of bound structures which then collapse to form stars .",
    "giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) are observed to contain highly supersonic motions and a wealth of structure on all length scales ( larson  1981 ; blitz & williams 1999 ) .",
    "the supersonic motions are generally thought to be turbulent in nature and to be the cause of the density structure in gmcs ( mac low & klessen  2004 ; elmegreen & scalo  2004 ) .",
    "we propose an alternative scenario whereby it is the passage of the clumpy interstellar medium through a galactic spiral shock that not only produces the dense environment in which molecular clouds form ( cowie 1981 ; elmegreen 1991 ) , but also gives rise at the same time to their supersonic internal motions ( bonnell 2006 ) .",
    "recent global simulations of non - self gravitating gas dynamics in spiral galaxies ( dobbs , bonnell & pringle 2006 ) show that the spiral shocks can account for the formation of molecular gas from cold ( @xmath0 k ) atomic gas and generate the large scale distribution of molecular clouds in spiral arms .",
    "structures in the spiral arms arise due to the shocks that tend to gather material together on converging orbits .",
    "thus , structures grow in time through multiple spiral arm passages .",
    "these structures present in the spiral arms are also found to form the spurs and feathering in the interarm region as they are sheared by the divergent orbits when leaving the spiral arms ( dobbs & bonnell 2006a ) . the high gas densities that result from the high mach number shocks are sufficient for rapid formation of @xmath1 gas and thus of giant molecular clouds .",
    "if , in contrast , the gas is warm ( @xmath2 k ) when it enters the shock , then @xmath1 formation can not occur due to the lower gas densities in the shock . in this model ,",
    "molecular clouds are limited to spiral arms as it is only there that the gas is sufficiently dense to form molecules .",
    "these clouds need not be self - gravitating as their formation is independent of self - gravity .",
    "the velocity dispersion in the gas also undergoes periodic bursts during the spiral arm passage as the clumpy shock drives supersonic random motions into the gas ( see below ) .",
    "such bursts in the internal gas motions are likely to be observable and would give support for a spiral shock origin of giant molecular clouds and the triggering of star formation .",
    "in simulations where self - gravity is included , the passage of gas through a spiral shock can result in the triggering of star formation ( bonnell  2006 ) .",
    "the evolution , over 34 million years , of @xmath3  of gas passing through the spiral potential is shown in figure  [ spiraltrig ] .",
    "the initially clumpy , low density gas ( @xmath4 pc@xmath5 ) is compressed by the spiral shock as it leaves the minimum of the potential . the shock forms some very dense ( @xmath6 pc@xmath5 ) regions , which become gravitationally bound and thus collapse to form regions of star formation .",
    "further accretion onto these regions , modeled with sink - particles in sph ( bate  1995 ) , raises their masses to that of typical stellar clusters ( @xmath7 to @xmath8 ) .",
    "star formation occurs within @xmath9 years after molecular cloud densities are reached .",
    "the total spiral arm passage lasts for @xmath10 years .",
    "the gas remains globally unbound throughout the simulation and re - expands in the post - shock region .",
    "the star formation efficiency is of order 10 % and should be taken as an upper limit in the absence of any form of stellar feedback .",
    "the star forming clouds that form in the spiral shocks are generally unbound and thus disperse once they leave the spiral arm .",
    "numerical simulations of unbound clouds ( clark & bonnell 2004 ; clark 2005 ) have recently shown that they can form local subregions which are gravitationally unstable and thus form stars .",
    "in contrast , the bulk of the cloud does not become bound and thus disperses without entering into the star formation process .",
    "the resultant star formation efficiencies are of order 10 per cent , even without the presence of the divergent flows of gas leaving a spiral arm .",
    "in fact , arbitrarily low star formation efficiencies are possible with relatively small deviations from bound conditions.this then offers a simple physical mechanism to explain the low star formation efficiency in our galaxy .",
    "in addition to triggering star formation , we must be able to explain the origin of the internal velocity dispersion and how it depends on the size of the region considered ( larson 1981 ; heyer & brunt 2004 ) . the evolution of the velocity dispersion as a function of the size of the region considered is shown in figure  3 ( from bonnell 2006 ) .",
    "the initially low velocity dispersion , of order the sound speed @xmath11 km / s , increases as the gas passes through the spiral shock . at the same time",
    ", the velocity dispersion increases more on larger scales , producing a @xmath12 velocity dispersion size - scale relation .",
    "the basic idea is that when structure exists in the pre - shocked gas , the stopping point of a particular clump depends on the density of gas with which it interacts .",
    "thus some regions will penetrate further into the shock , broadening it and leaving it with a remnant velocity dispersion in the shock direction .",
    "smaller scale regions in the shock are likely to have more uniform momentum injection as well as encountering similar amounts of mass .",
    "this then results in small velocity dispersions .",
    "larger regions will have less correlation in both the momentum injection and mass loading such that there will be a larger dispersion in the post - shock velocity .",
    "any clumpy shock can induce such velocity dispersions .",
    "thus the fractal nature of the ism passing through a spiral shock is a straightforward explanation for how the velocity dispersion size relation arises in molecular clouds ( dobbs & bonnell 2006b ) .",
    "clumpy shocks may also be an important role in setting the clump - mass spectrum .",
    "numerical simulations of colliding clumpy flows show that from an initial population of identical clumps , the shocked gas contains a spectrum of clump masses that is consistent with a salpeter - like slope ( clark & bonnell 2006 ) .",
    "this clump mass spectrum arises due to the coagulation and fragmentation of the clumps in the shock , and is very similar to that observed in dense prestellar cores ( motte 1998 ) .",
    "the relation between this clump - mass spectrum and the stellar imf is unclear as it arises independently of self - gravity and thus a one - to - one mapping of clump to stellar masses is unlikley .",
    "instead , the produced clumps are likely to be a combination of unbound clumps that will not form stars and clumps that are very bound that will form multiple many stars .",
    "the triggering of star formation by the passage of clumpy gas through a spiral arm can explain many of the observed properties of star forming regions .",
    "molecular cloud formation occurs as long as the pre - shock gas is cold ( @xmath13 k ) .",
    "the shock forms dense structures in the gas which become locally bound and collapse to form stars .",
    "the clouds are globally unbound and thus disperse on timescales of @xmath14 years , resulting in relatively low star formation efficiencies .",
    "in addition , the clumpy shock reproduces the observed kinematics of gmcs , the so - called larson relation .",
    "there is no need for any internal driving of the quasi - turbulent random motions .",
    "the internal structure of gmcs can also be understood as being a produce of a clumpy shock and even the observed clump - mass spectrum in pre - stellar cores is reproduced .",
    "finally , the clouds are sheared upon leaving the spiral arms , producing the spurs and feathering commonly observed in spiral galaxies ."
