    "the constrained minimal supersymmetric model ( cmssm ) , also referred to as msugra , is based on the standard model gauge symmetry @xmath3 and has the fewest number of fundamental parameters arising from the supersymmetric extension of the sm .",
    "supersymmetry breaking in the cmssm originates in some unspecified ` hidden ' sector , which is then transmitted through gravity to our ` visible ' sector .",
    "the lightest neutralino ( lsp ) in the cmssm is stable and a leading dark matter candidate particle .",
    "intense searches including direct , indirect and at the lhc , are currently underway to find the lsp .",
    "a flurry of recent papers by the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite experiments at the lhc are beginning to constrain the cmssm parameter space , which translates into new lower bounds on a variety of sparticle masses including the gluino and the squarks of the first two families .",
    "the apparent unification at @xmath4 of the cmssm gauge couplings strongly suggests the presence of an underlying grand unified theory ( gut ) such as @xmath1 or @xmath0 . since the three mssm gauge multiplets reside in a single unified gauge multiplet of @xmath1 or @xmath0 , it would seem quite natural that the various mssm gauginos all acquire the same universal mass @xmath5 at @xmath6 . however , the universal gaugino mass assumption is , in fact , not a general consequence of gravity mediated susy breaking . in the gravity mediation scenario ,",
    "the gaugino masses are given by non - zero @xmath7-term of the gauge kinetic function which , generally , is in one of the irreducible representations of a symmetric product of two adjoint representations and hence , not necessarily a singlet .",
    "therefore , if such a non - singlet develops a non - zero @xmath7-term , the mssm gaugino masses can be expected to be non - universal . interestingly , if we assume that a single non - zero @xmath7-term dominates the gauge kinetic function , the ratios between the mssm gaugino masses are completely determined by group theory , depending only on the way the mssm gauge multiplets are embedded in the symmetric product of two adjoint representations of the gut gauge group .",
    "this means that the number of free parameters in a setup with non - universal gaugino masses ( nugm ) remains the same as in the cmssm , at least in the gauge sector .    in the mssm , the lightest neutralino ,",
    "if it is the lsp , is a primary candidate for the dark matter particle .",
    "since the neutralino is an admixture of gauginos and higgsinos , its mass and interaction with other ( s)particles are determined by the masses of bino , wino and higgsinos . thus , a boundary condition involving non - universal gaugino masses can dramatically alter the phenomenology of neutralino dark matter from the cmssm case @xcite .",
    "in addition , the neutralino lsp plays a key role in the susy search at high energy colliders , and composition and mass of the neutralino being different from the cmssm case has impact on susy searches at the tevatron @xcite and at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate the tev scale particle spectroscopy of susy @xmath0 and @xmath1 inspired model with non - universal gaugino masses .",
    "taking a variety of phenomenological constraints into account , in particular , the relic density of neutralino dark matter , we identify the allowed regions of the input ssb parameters for various @xmath8 values .",
    "we consider both signs of the mssm @xmath2-parameter . for the allowed parameter region ,",
    "we calculate the spin - independent ( si ) and spin - dependent ( sd ) cross sections for neutralino elastic scattering off a nucleon , and compare our results with the current and proposed future bounds from direct and indirect dark mater search experiments .",
    "we also present several benchmark points from the allowed region and show the sparticle mass spectra , which can be tested at the lhc .",
    "the mass spectra are compared with those from the cmssm with suitably fixed parameter sets .",
    "we first review how the non - universal gaugino masses arise in the so(10 ) gut . in gravity mediation",
    ", we introduce a higher dimensional operator between the gauge field strength superfield @xmath9 and a hidden sector chiral superfield @xmath10 , @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the group indices for so(10 ) , and @xmath13 gev is the reduced planck mass . in this paper , we consider only a single hidden sector field @xmath10 whose non - zero @xmath7-term breaks susy and generates the gaugino masses : @xmath14    in so(10 ) , a possible representation of the hidden sector field is given by one of the irreducible representations contained in the symmetric product of two adjoint 45-dimensional representations : @xmath15 if the hidden sector field is not the singlet , non - universal masses for the mssm gauginos are generated .",
    "however , the ratio between the mssm gaugino masses is determined by the embedding of the sm gauge groups with in each irreducible representation @xcite .    among the three possibilities in eq.([eq3 ] )",
    ", we investigate @xmath10 in the * 54 * representation in this paper .",
    "in fact , this is the most reasonable case from the theoretical point of view .",
    "we are considering susy @xmath0 as a more fundamental theory within which the mssm is embedded .",
    "we may expect that the @xmath0 model is further unified into a more fundamental theory including gravity , most likely some string theory at the planck scale . note that this picture constrains the field representations introduced in the model ,",
    "since large representations carry a large @xmath16-function , and this can cause the @xmath0 gauge coupling to blow up below the planck scale .",
    "indeed , the introduction of an irreducible representation larger than 126 is excluded by this argument @xcite . with the * 54 * -plet of hidden sector field",
    ", the ratios of the non - universal gaugino masses is found to be @xcite @xmath17    the above discussion is readily extended to @xmath1 , and the gluino mass ratios turn out to be the same as in eq.([nugratio ] ) for a hidden sector field in the 24-dimensional adjoint representation @xcite .",
    "thus , our analysis in this paper applies both to @xmath0 and @xmath1 models .",
    "however , note that in the @xmath1 gut , the matter multiplets of each family are not completely unified in a single representation and in general , the masses of sfermions in * 5*@xmath18 and * 10 * representations can be non - universal .",
    "this non - universality of sfermion masses can serve as a probe to discriminate the underlying gut gauge groups @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we identify the parameter region which is consistent with a variety of phenomenological constraints . since the ratio between the non - universal gaugino masses is fixed as in eq .",
    "( [ nugratio ] ) , the number of free parameters remains the same as in the cmssm .",
    "we use the notation @xmath19 , so that @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the fundamental parameters of the * @xmath22 * model that we consider are as follows : @xmath23",
    "we employ the isajet  7.80 package  @xcite to perform random scans over the parameter space listed in eq .",
    "( [ parameters ] ) . in this package ,",
    "the weak scale values of gauge and third generation yukawa couplings are evolved to @xmath24 via the mssm renormalization group equations ( rges ) in the @xmath25 regularization scheme .",
    "we do not strictly enforce the unification condition @xmath26 at @xmath24 , since a few percent deviation from unification can be assigned to unknown gut - scale threshold corrections  @xcite . at @xmath24 , the boundary conditions given in eq .",
    "( [ parameters ] ) are imposed and all the ssb parameters , along with the gauge and yukawa couplings , are evolved back to the weak scale @xmath27 .",
    "the impact of the neutrino dirac yukawa coupling in the running of the rges is significant only for relatively large values ( @xmath28 or so ) @xcite . in the so(10 ) gut we expect the largest dirac coupling to be comparable to the top yukawa coupling ( @xmath29 at @xmath24 ) and thus we safely neglect effects of the neutrino dirac yukawa coupling in our analysis .    in the evaluation of yukawa couplings",
    "the susy threshold corrections  @xcite are taken into account at the common scale @xmath30 .",
    "the entire parameter set is iteratively run between @xmath27 and @xmath24 using the full 2-loop rges until a stable solution is obtained .",
    "to better account for leading - log corrections , one - loop step - beta functions are adopted for gauge and yukawa couplings , and the ssb parameters @xmath31 are extracted from rges at multiple scales @xmath32 .",
    "the rge - improved 1-loop effective potential is minimized at an optimized scale @xmath33 , which effectively accounts for the leading 2-loop corrections .",
    "full 1-loop radiative corrections are incorporated for all sparticle masses .",
    "the requirement of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking ( rewsb )  @xcite puts an important theoretical constraint on the parameter space .",
    "another important constraint comes from limits on the cosmological abundance of stable charged particles  @xcite .",
    "this excludes regions in the parameter space where charged susy particles , such as @xmath34 or @xmath35 , become the lsp .",
    "we accept only those solutions for which one of the neutralinos is the lsp and saturates the dark matter relic abundance bound observed by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) .",
    "we perform random scans for the following parameter range : @xmath36 with @xmath37 @xcite . the results are not too sensitive to one or two sigma variation in the value of @xmath38 .",
    "we use @xmath39 gev which is hard - coded into isajet .",
    "in scanning the parameter space , we employ the metropolis - hastings algorithm as described in @xcite .",
    "all of the collected data points satisfy the requirement of rewsb , with the neutralino in each case being the lsp .",
    "furthermore , all of these points satisfy the constraint @xmath40 .",
    "this is done so as to collect more points with a wmap compatible value of cold dark matter ( cdm ) relic abundance . for the metropolis - hastings algorithm",
    ", we only use the value of @xmath41 to bias our search .",
    "our purpose in using the metropolis - hastings algorithm is to be able to search around regions of acceptable @xmath41 more fully . after collecting the data ,",
