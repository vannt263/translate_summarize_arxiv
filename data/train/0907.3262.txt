    "the goal of the present work is to discuss the continuous limits of large random planar maps when the distribution of the degree of a typical face has a heavy tail .",

    "it is convenient to deal with rooted planar maps , meaning that there is a distinguished oriented edge called the _",
    "one is interested in the `` shape '' of the graph and not in the particular embedding that is considered .",
    "more rigorously , two rooted planar maps are identified if they correspond via an orientation - preserving homeomorphism of the sphere .",
    "the faces of the map are the connected components of the complement of edges and the degree of a face counts the number of edges that are incident to it .",
    "large random planar graphs are of particular interest in theoretical physics , where they serve as models of random geometry @xcite .    a simple way to generate",
    "a large random planar map is to choose it uniformly at random from the set of all rooted @xmath6-angulations with @xmath1 faces ( a planar map is a @xmath6-angulation if all faces have degree @xmath6 ) .",
    "it is conjectured that the scaling limit of uniformly distributed @xmath6-angulations with @xmath1 faces , when @xmath1 tends to infinity ( or , equivalently , when the number of vertices tends to infinity ) , does not depend on the choice of @xmath6 and is given by the so - called brownian map .",
    "since the pioneering work of chassaing and schaeffer @xcite , there have been several results supporting this conjecture .",
    "marckert and mokkadem @xcite introduced the brownian map and proved a weak form of the convergence of rescaled uniform quadrangulations toward the brownian map .",
    "a stronger version , involving convergence of the associated metric spaces in the sense of the gromov  hausdorff distance , was derived in le gall @xcite in the case of uniformly distributed @xmath7-angulations . because the distribution of the brownian map has not been fully characterized , the convergence results of @xcite require the extraction of suitable subsequences .",
    "proving the uniqueness of the distribution of the brownian map is one of the key open problems in this area .",
    "a more general way of choosing a large planar map at random is to use boltzmann distributions . in this work ,",
    "we restrict our attention to bipartite maps , where all face degrees are even . given a sequence @xmath8 of nonnegative real numbers and a bipartite planar map @xmath9",
    ", the associated boltzmann weight is @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the set of all faces of @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the degree of the face  @xmath14 .",
    "one can then generate a large planar map by choosing it at random from the set of all planar maps with @xmath1 vertices ( or with @xmath1 faces ) with probability weights that are proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "such distributions arise naturally ( possibly in slightly different forms ) in problems involving statistical physics models on random maps .",
    "this is discussed in section [ sec : some - motivation - from ] below .",
    "assuming certain integrability conditions on the sequence of weights , marckert and miermont @xcite obtain a variety of limit theorems for large random bipartite planar maps chosen according to these boltzmann distributions .",
    "these results are extended in miermont @xcite and miermont and weill @xcite to the nonbipartite case , including large triangulations . in all of these papers , limiting distributions are described in terms of the brownian map .",
    "therefore , these results strongly suggest that the brownian map should be the universal limit of large random planar maps , under the condition that the distribution of the degrees of faces satisfies some integrability property .",
    "note that , even though the distribution of the brownian map has not been characterized , many of its properties can be investigated in detail and have interesting consequences for typical large planar maps ; see , in particular , the recent papers @xcite and @xcite ( and bettinelli @xcite , for similar results , for random maps on surfaces of higher genus ) .    in the present work , we consider boltzmann distributions such that , even for large @xmath1 , a random planar map with @xmath1 vertices will have `` macroscopic '' faces , which , in some sense , will remain present in the scaling limit",
    "this leads to a ( conjectured ) scaling limit which is different from the brownian map .",
    "in fact , our limit theorems involve new random processes that are closely related to the stable trees of @xcite , in contrast to the construction of the brownian map @xcite , which is based on aldous continuum random tree ( crt ) .",
    "let us informally describe our main results , referring to the following sections for more precise statements .",
    "for technical reasons , we consider planar maps that are both rooted and pointed ( in addition to the root edge , there is a distinguished vertex , denoted by @xmath16 ) .",
    "roughly speaking , we choose the boltzmann weights @xmath17 in ( [ bolt - weight ] ) in such a way that the distribution of the degree of a ( typical ) face is in the domain of attraction of a stable distribution with index @xmath0 .",
    "this can be made more precise by using the bouttier  di francesco  guitter bijection @xcite between bipartite planar maps and certain labeled trees called _",
    "mobiles_. a mobile is a ( rooted ) plane tree , where vertices at even distance ( resp . , odd distance ) from the root",
    "are called white ( resp . ,",
    "black ) and white vertices are assigned integer labels that satisfy certain simple rules ; see section [ sec : mobiles - bouttier - di ] . in the bouttier  di francesco ",
    "guitter bijection , a ( rooted and pointed ) planar map @xmath12 corresponds to a mobile @xmath18 in such a way that each face of @xmath12 is associated with a black vertex of @xmath18 and each vertex of @xmath12 ( with the exception of the distinguished vertex @xmath16 ) is associated with a white vertex of @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , the degree of a face of @xmath12 is exactly twice the degree of the associated black vertex in the mobile @xmath18 ( see section [ sec : mobiles - bouttier - di ] for more details ) .    under appropriate conditions on the sequence of weights @xmath19 , formula ( [ bolt - weight ] )",
    "defines a finite measure @xmath20 on the set of all rooted and pointed planar maps .",
    "moreover , if @xmath21 is the probability measure obtained by normalizing @xmath20 , then the mobile @xmath18 associated with a planar map @xmath12 distributed according to @xmath21 is a critical two - type galton ",
    "watson tree , with different offspring distributions @xmath22 and @xmath23 for white and black vertices , respectively , and labels chosen uniformly over all possible assignments ( see @xcite and proposition [ mobile - map ] below ) .",
    "the distribution @xmath22 is always geometric , whereas @xmath23 has a simple expression in terms of the weights @xmath17 .",
    "we now come to our basic assumption . in the present work ,",
    "we choose the weights @xmath17 in such a way that @xmath24 behaves like @xmath25 , when @xmath26 , for some @xmath0 .",
    "recalling that the degree of a face of @xmath12 is equal to twice the degree of the associated black vertex in the mobile @xmath18 , we see that , in a certain sense , the face degrees of a planar map distributed according to @xmath21 are independent , with a common distribution that belongs to the domain of attraction of a stable law with index @xmath2 .",
    "we equip the vertex set @xmath27 of a planar map @xmath12 with the graph distance @xmath28 and would like to investigate the properties of this metric space when @xmath12 is distributed according to @xmath21 and conditioned to be large . for every integer @xmath29 , denote by @xmath30 a random planar map distributed according to @xmath31 .",
    "our goal is to get information about typical distances in the metric space @xmath32 when @xmath1 is large and , if at all possible , to prove that these ( suitably rescaled ) metric spaces converge in distribution as @xmath4 in the sense of the gromov  hausdorff distance . as a motivation for studying the particular conditioning @xmath33",
    ", we note that our results will have immediate application to boltzmann distributions on _ nonpointed _ rooted planar maps : simply observe that a given rooted planar map with @xmath1 vertices corresponds to exactly @xmath1 different rooted and pointed planar maps .",
    "to achieve the preceding goal , we use another nice feature of the bouttier  di francesco ",
    "guitter bijection : up to an additive constant depending on @xmath12 , the distance between @xmath16 and an arbitrary vertex @xmath34 coincides with the label of the white vertex of @xmath18 associated with @xmath35 .",
    "thus , in order to understand the asymptotic behavior of distances from @xmath16 in the map @xmath30 , it suffices to get information about labels in the mobile @xmath36 when @xmath1 is large . to this end",
    ", we first consider the tree @xmath37 obtained by ignoring the labels in @xmath36 . under our basic assumption , the results of @xcite can be applied to prove that the tree @xmath37 converges in distribution , modulo a rescaling of distances by the factor @xmath38 , toward the so - called stable tree with index @xmath2 .",
    "the stable tree can be defined by a suitable coding from the sample path of a centered stable lvy process with no negative jumps and index @xmath2 , under an appropriate excursion measure .",
    "the preceding convergence to the stable tree is , however , not sufficient for our purposes since we are primarily interested in labels .",
    "note that , under the assumptions made in @xcite on the weight sequence @xmath19 ( and , in particular , in the case of uniformly distributed @xmath7-angulations ) , the rescaled trees @xmath37 converge toward the crt and the scaling limit of labels is described in @xcite as brownian motion indexed by the crt or , equivalently , as the brownian snake driven by a normalized brownian excursion . in our `` heavy tail '' setting , however , the scaling limit of the labels is _ not _ brownian motion indexed by the stable tree , but is given by a new random process of independent interest , which we call the _ continuous distance process_.    let us give an informal presentation of the distance process",
    " a rigorous definition can be found in section [ sec : continuous - object ] below .",
    "we view the stable tree as the genealogical tree for a continuous population and the distance of a vertex from the root is interpreted as its generation in the tree .",
    "fix a vertex @xmath39 in the stable tree . among the ancestors of @xmath39 ,",
    "countably many of them , denoted by @xmath40 correspond to a sudden creation of mass in the population : each @xmath41 has a macroscopic number @xmath42 of `` children '' and one can also consider the quantity @xmath43 $ ] , which is the rank among these children of the one that is an ancestor of @xmath39 .",
    "the preceding description is informal in our continuous setting ( there are no children ) , but can be made rigorous thanks to the ideas developed in @xcite and , in particular , to the coding of the stable tree by a lvy process .",
    "we then associate with each vertex @xmath41 a brownian bridge @xmath44}$ ] ( starting and ending at @xmath45 ) with duration @xmath46 , independently when @xmath47 varies , and we set @xmath48 the resulting process @xmath49 when @xmath39 varies in the stable tree is the continuous distance process . as a matter of fact , since vertices of the stable tree are parametrized by the interval @xmath50 $ ] ( using the coding by a lvy process ) , it is more convenient to define the continuous distance process as a process @xmath51}$ ] indexed by the interval @xmath50 $ ] ( or even by @xmath52 when we consider a forest of trees ) .",
    "much of the technical work contained in this article is devoted to proving that the rescaled labels in the mobile @xmath36 converge in distribution to the continuous distance process .",
    "the proper rescaling of labels involves the multiplicative factor @xmath3 instead of @xmath53 , as in earlier work .",
    "this indicates that the typical diameter of our random planar maps @xmath30 is of order @xmath54 , rather than @xmath55 in the case of maps with faces of bounded degree .",
    "because conditioning on the total number of vertices makes the proof more difficult , we first establish a version of the convergence of labels for a forest of independent mobiles having the distribution of @xmath18 under @xmath21 .",
    "the proof of this result ( theorem [ functional ] ) is given in section [ forest - mobiles ] .",
    "we then derive the desired convergence for the conditioned objects in section [ contour - conditioned ] .",
    "finally , we obtain asymptotic results for the planar maps @xmath30 in section [ large - maps ] .",
    "theorem [ asymptodistance ] gives precise information about the profile of distances from the distinguished vertex @xmath16 in @xmath30 .",
    "precisely , let @xmath56 be the measure on @xmath52 defined by @xmath57 then , the sequence of random measures @xmath56 converges in distribution toward the measure @xmath58 defined by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a constant depending on the sequence of weights and @xmath61 } d_t$ ] .",
    "we also investigate the convergence of the suitably rescaled metric spaces @xmath62 in the gromov ",
    "hausdorff sense .",
    "theorem [ ghconv ] shows that , at least along a subsequence , the random metric spaces @xmath63 converge in distribution toward a limiting random compact metric space .",
    "furthermore , the hausdorff dimension of this limiting space is a.s .",
    "equal to @xmath5 , which should be compared with the value @xmath64 for the dimension of the brownian map @xcite .",
    "the fact that the hausdorff dimension is bounded above by @xmath5 follows from hlder continuity properties of the distance process that are established in section [ sec : continuous - object ] .",
    "the proof of the corresponding lower bound is more involved and depends on some properties of the stable tree and its coding by lvy processes , which are investigated in @xcite .",
    "similarly as in the case of the convergence to the brownian map , the extraction of a subsequence in theorem [ ghconv ] is needed because the limiting distribution is not characterized .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "one conjectures that there exists a function @xmath1343 and a critical value @xmath1344 such that :      these two different behaviors , called the _ dense _ and the _ dilute _ phase , respectively , hint at the asymptotics @xmath1351 with @xmath1352 and @xmath1353 , respectively .",
    "recalling section [ sec : choos - boltzm - weights ] and the preceding formula for @xmath17 , we see that the scaling limits of the distribution @xmath1316 in ( [ model - o(n ) ] ) should be related to the model studied in the previous sections , with the particular value @xmath1354 .",
    "note that the case @xmath1355 appears as a limiting critical situation where the dense and dilute phases should coincide .",

    "one gets the percolation model , where conditionally on the quadrangulation @xmath1302 , all @xmath1362 are equally likely to occur .",
    "one then defines the exterior gasket in a way that should be clear from figure [ fig : gasket ] .",
    "this gasket again has a boltzmann - type distribution when @xmath1363 is distributed according to @xmath1364 .",
    "as previously , the relevant boltzmann weights correspond to partition functions for the ising model on a quadrangulation with a boundary . on the other hand ,",
    "the topological constraints on the gaskets are now different : the boundaries of holes need not be cycles and do not have to be disjoint ( however , an edge can be incident to at most one hole and is incident only once to this hole ) ; see figure [ fig : gasket ] .",
    "kazakov @xcite identifies the value @xmath1365 as critical .",
    "one conjectures that , respectively , for @xmath1366 and @xmath1367 ( and with the appropriate values of @xmath130 ) , the ising model has the same scaling limit as the dilute and dense phases of the @xmath1368 model , corresponding to @xmath1369 and @xmath1370 .",
    "this is confirmed ( for @xmath1366 ) by predictions for the partition function of the ising model with a boundary ; see , for example , section 3.3 of @xcite .",
    "note that a discussion parallel to the present one appears in sheffield @xcite , section 2.3 , in the case of regular hexagonal lattices , where it is conjectured that the external gasket of @xmath1301 models should converge to the so - called _ conformal loop ensembles _ , which are a conformally invariant family of random curves related to the schramm - loewner evolutions .",
    "such parallel discussions might open some paths in the mathematical understanding of the so - called kpz formula , which links scaling exponents for models on random and on regular lattices .",
    "this approach would still be different from the one developed recently by duplantier and sheffield @xcite as we are focusing more on the metric aspects of planar maps , rather than on the conformal invariance properties that are intrinsic to @xcite .    at a rigorous level",
    ", it seems plausible that the topological constraints that appear in the random maps considered above can be handled using bijective methods , in the spirit of section [ sec : mobiles - bouttier - di ] .",
