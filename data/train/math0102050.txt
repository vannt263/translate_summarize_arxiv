    "this is an example of a group which coxeter  @xcite has called @xmath235 thus @xmath236 .",
    "moreover , @xmath237 will be infinite whenever @xmath226 is .    and",
    "indeed , these groups are usually infinite as edjvet has shown :    [ the ] if @xmath238 , @xmath239 and @xmath240 , then the group @xmath241 is finite if and only if it is one of the following :    \\(viii ) = @xmath242 = @xmath243 ( i ) @xmath242 @xmath243 ; + ( ii ) @xmath244 @xmath245 ; + ( iii ) @xmath246 @xmath247 ; + ( iv ) @xmath244 @xmath248 ; + ( v ) @xmath249 @xmath250 ; + ( vi ) @xmath251 @xmath252 ; + ( vii ) @xmath253 @xmath254 ; + ( viii ) @xmath255 @xmath256 ; + ( ix ) @xmath257 ; + ( x ) @xmath258 @xmath259 ; + ( xi ) @xmath260 .    since @xmath19 is odd , if @xmath261 , then @xmath226 is infinite unless @xmath262 or @xmath99 .    similarly , if @xmath263 , we see that @xmath226 is infinite unless @xmath264 or @xmath99 ( @xmath265 is also odd ) whence @xmath266 .",
    "on the other hand , by @xcite , the finite filling @xmath224 and the toroidal filling @xmath123 ( lemma  [ letor2 ] ) have distance at most @xmath219 .",
    "since @xmath224 is odd and @xmath123 is even , they in fact differ by at most @xmath223 .",
    "thus , @xmath267 .",
    "it follows that @xmath268 , whence @xmath269 .",
    "so we can assume that @xmath270 .",
    "that is , if @xmath271 , the knot admits no non - trivial finite surgeries .",
    "now , earlier work shows that there are no non - trivial surgeries unless @xmath272 .",
    "so , given @xmath273 , and assuming @xmath270 , we see that we are left to investigate @xmath274 .",
    "and since theorem  [ thpqr ] does not apply to the knots @xmath275 , @xmath276 and @xmath277 these knots must also be examined .",
    "the details may be found in @xcite .",
    "note that we again use snappea  @xcite to resolve a few difficult cases .    in summary",
    "then , theorems  [ thpqr ] and [ the ] combine to show that a @xmath27 admits no non - trivial finite surgery unless @xmath274 and @xmath270 .",
    "those cases have been investigated directly and also admit no non - trivial finite surgeries .",
    "we have therefore proved    a @xmath27 pretzel knot , with @xmath28 even and @xmath29 odd admits no non - trivial finite surgeries .",
