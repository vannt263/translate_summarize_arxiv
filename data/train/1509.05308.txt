    "the quench of systems , like ferromagnets or binary mixtures , to below the critical point is characterized by the formation and subsequent growth of domains .",
    "the typical feature of the phase ordering process is dynamical scaling , whereby physical properties become time - independent if lengths are measured in units of @xmath3 , i.e. the typical domain size at time @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "this scaling scenario is expected to be valid also in presence of quenched disorder when it does not prevent the phase - ordering process @xcite . in the case of pure systems power law growth @xmath5",
    "is well established .",
    "conversely , when disorder is present the nature of asymptotic growht has been much debated  @xcite .    in general terms ,",
    "disorder generated energy barriers bring about a slowing down of the coarsening process  @xcite and , as a rule of thumb , more disorder means slower growth .",
    "however , recent studies have shown that the growth low does not behave monotonically with increasing disorder in the two dimensional site or bond diluted ising model  @xcite . in these systems , where a fraction @xmath0 of sites or bonds is randomly removed from a regular lattice , one observes that , for sufficiently large @xmath0 , more disorder produces faster growth .",
    "more precisely , starting from the pure case with @xmath6 , where the usual temperature - independent power - law @xmath7 is obeyed , one enters a region with an asymptotic logarithmic behavior as soon as @xmath8 .",
    "however a temperature - dependent power - law growth is observed right at @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the critical percolation density , thus leading to a non - monotonic dependence of the speed of growth upon the disorder strength @xmath0 .",
    "this counterintuitive behavior has been interpreted in terms of the topology of the network of occupied sites or bonds  @xcite with the temperature - dependent algebraic behavior associated to the fractal properties of the percolating network .    in this article , by studying numerically the site - diluted ising model ( sdim ) and the bond diluted one ( bdim ) in @xmath11 we find a non - monotonous dependence of @xmath3 on disorder qualitatively similar to the two - dimensional case .",
    "this suggests that the relation between growth - law and topology might be a rather generic property , a fact that could provide new insights into the problem of phase - separation in disordered ferromagnets .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ models ] we describe the models , the sdim and the bdim , that will be considered and studied throughout this paper . in sec .",
    "[ gl ] we present an overview of the results in @xmath12 whereas numerical simulations of the @xmath11 models are discussed in sec .",
    "[ 3d ] . in sec .",
    "[ concl ] we conclude the paper with a final discussion of the results and of some open issues .",
    "in the sdim a network is prepared by generating configurations of occupied sites as in random percolation . on the sites of a square three - dimensional lattice",
    "there are independent random variables @xmath13 , which take values @xmath14 ( occupied site ) with probability @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( empty site ) with probability @xmath17 .",
    "the substrate is formed by the set of occupied sites .",
    "any couple of nearest - neighbour occupied sites is connected by a _",
    "bond_.    in the bdim , instead , starting from a regular square three - dimensional lattice one removes bonds between nearest - neighbouring sites @xmath18 at random with probability @xmath0 .",
    "specifically , an independent random variable @xmath19 is defined on each couple of nearest sites , which takes values @xmath20 with probability @xmath0 ( bond is absent ) and @xmath21 with probability @xmath22 ( bond is present ) .    for both models ,",
    "@xmath0 will be referred to as dilution .",
    "we now describe the geometrical structure of the network as @xmath0 goes from high to low values .",
    "recalling that the percolation threshold is @xmath23 and @xmath24 for site and bond percolation respectively , for @xmath25 , the network is a patchwork of finite clusters of occupied sites ( bonds ) with a characteristic size that diverges at the threshold and a fractal dimension @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the dilution range @xmath27 will not be considered in this paper since , lacking an infinite cluster , perpetual coarsening can not be sustained . at @xmath28 ,",
    "the size of the percolating cluster of sites ( bonds ) diverges .",
    "as @xmath0 is lowered below @xmath28 , the infinite cluster has a fractal geometry over distances up to a typical length @xmath29 that diverges at the threshold as ( d)~(d_c - d)^- , [ divxi ] with @xmath30 , whereas it becomes compact over larger distances .",
    "moreover , clusters of finite size are also present .",
    "the structure of the network described above holds in the range @xmath31 , where @xmath2 is a dilution value where ( d^ * ) = a , [ sub.3 ] and @xmath32 is a microscopic length , like the lattice spacing . for @xmath33 ,",
    "the infinite cluster is compact on any lengthscale and finite clusters are absent .",
    "the remaining far - apart vacancies inside this cluster are essentially single - site objects .",
    "their average distance defines a new characteristic length ( d ) = a(d^*/d)^. [ sub.4 ]      the diluted ising model is described by the following hamiltonian h=-_<ij > k_ij_i _ j. [ ham ] here @xmath34 are spins on the 3-d square lattice , and the couplings @xmath35 for the sdim is chosen as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a constant , and @xmath16 or @xmath14 with probability @xmath0 and @xmath22 , respectively . for the bdim , instead , @xmath14 on all sites and @xmath38 or @xmath39 with probability @xmath0 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "notice that , since @xmath40 , the model is ferromagnetic .",
    "the equilibrium phase - diagram of the model is pictorially represented in fig .",
    "[ fig_tc ] . for @xmath41 , at low enough temperature the system exhibits ferromagnetic order . in the @xmath42 plane",
    "there is a critical line @xmath43 , which separates the paramagnetic from the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath43 , which in the following will be measured in units of @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the boltzmann constant , decreases from the pure value ( @xmath46 ) as the dilution is increased and vanishes at @xmath28 ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "non - conserved dynamics@xcite is implemented by evolving the spins with single - spin - flip transition rates of the glauber form w(_i -_i)= .",
    "[ transr ] here , @xmath48 is the local weiss field obtained by the sum h_i^w = _ j l_i k_ij _ j over the set of nearest - neighbors @xmath49 of @xmath50 .",
    "the system is initially prepared in the infinite - temperature disordered state and , at the time @xmath51 , it is suddenly quenched to a finite temperature @xmath52 .",
    "this temperature is set in the simulations to a value @xmath53 for the sdim and @xmath54 for the bdim .",
    "these values are chosen as a compromise : on the one hand we want to work in the limit of low - temperatures because the interplay between the two types of growth - law we are interested in is expected in the @xmath55 limit @xcite . on the other hand",
    "very low temperatures are useless in simulations for at least a couple of reasons .",
    "the first is that at very low temperatures pinning effects make the dynamics very slow . as a result",
    "the growing length @xmath56 does not vary appreciably in the time range accessed by the simulations and it is difficult to discriminate between different growth - laws .",
    "the second related reason is that at low temperatures the pinning centres produce a stop and go behavior of interfaces which , in turn , gives rise to an oscillatory behavior on top of the growth of @xmath56 .",
    "these oscillations prevent a reliable determination of the growth - law .",
    "a similar behavior is observed on fractal substrates @xcite    in sec .",
    "[ 3d ] we will present the results of simulations of systems with different values of @xmath0 in the range @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "it must be noticed that , as discussed more detailedly in @xcite , for dilutions @xmath58 or close to it the working temperature @xmath59 is necessarily larger than @xmath43 , see fig .",
    "[ fig_tc ] .",
    "hence we are quenching above the critical temperature @xmath60 , the system will eventually relax to a disordered state with a finite spin coherence length @xmath61 ( not to be confused with the substrate property @xmath62 ) and the growth of @xmath56 will eventually stop at @xmath63 when @xmath64 . in a preasymptotic stage with @xmath65 coarsening",
    "takes place and , since @xmath61 diverges very fast for @xmath55 , this can last for a very long time .",
    "the situation is similar to the one found in other ferromagnetic systems with @xmath66 as , for instance , the one - dimensional ising model @xcite .",
    "we have checked that @xmath67 is sufficiently low as to never observe the equilibration of the system in the range of simulated times , and that the system keeps on coarsening at any simulated time .",
    "the observable quantity of interest in this paper is the typical domain size @xmath56 . for a model defined on a disconnected network , as it happens for @xmath68 ,",
    "phase ordering occurs independently on the various parts of the system and , correspondingly , different definitions of the growing length can be given .",
    "following @xcite , we determine this quantity from the inverse excess energy as l(t , d)=[e(t , d)-e_(d)]^-1 , [ lt ] where @xmath69 is the energy at time @xmath4 , the angular brackets denote a non - equilibrium ensemble average , taken over random initial conditions and over dynamical trajectories and disorder realizations , and @xmath70 is the energy of the equilibrium state at the final temperature @xmath52 .",
    "( [ lt ] ) , which is often used to determine @xmath56 in non - diluted systems @xcite , has , in the present case , the further advantage that the disconnected finite parts of the substrate which are already ordered do not contribute to the computation of @xmath56 .",
    "indeed each droplet is surrounded by empty sites in the sdim or by null bonds in the bdim and hence there is no excess energy associated with it when all spins are aligned , as discussed in @xcite . using eq.([lt ] ) , then , one computes @xmath56 only on the regions where growth is active , which is the kind of information we are interested in .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the kinetic properties of the @xmath71-sdim and bdim are due to the presence of three fixed points , in the sense of the renormalization group , existing on the @xmath0 axis .",
    "the first fixed point is the trivial one of the pure system , located at @xmath1 , and is associated to the usual power - law growth @xmath72 .",
    "the second one is the _ percolative _ fixed point located at @xmath28 and is characterized by a temperature - dependent power - law growth l(t , d_c)~t^1/(t ) , [ ldc ] with @xmath73 .",
    "this new power - law growth is due to the fact that diluted sites act as pinning centres where interfaces get stucked unless an activation energy @xmath74 is supplied by the thermal bath .",
    "according to the argument presented in @xcite this energy scales as @xmath75 .",
    "this is expected to be true for sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "assuming an arrhenius time @xmath76 $ ] to exceed such energetic barriers one obtains eq .",
    "( [ ldc ] ) with an exponent 1/(t)=k_bt / a [ expt ] proportional to the absolute temperature .",
    "the two fixed points discussed above are repulsive , in the sense that as soon as @xmath77 , or @xmath78 the asymptotic dynamics is governed by a different fixed point , located at @xmath79 ( roughly half way between @xmath1 and @xmath58 ) , to which a logarithmic increase of @xmath80 is associated . due to these fixed point structure ,",
    "if the system is prepared with an intermediate dilution between @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( or equivalently between @xmath2 and @xmath28 ) a crossover pattern is observed at a certain time @xmath81 from an initial transient regime governed by the nearest unstable fixed point ( @xmath1 or @xmath28 respectively ) , with a power - law increase of the domains size , to a late regime controlled by the attractive point at @xmath2 , characterized by a logarithmic @xmath56 .",
    "the crossover phenomenon occurs when @xmath56 reaches the typical size associated to dilution , which is either @xmath82 or @xmath62 depending on @xmath83 or @xmath84 .",
    "given that both @xmath85 and @xmath86 decrease approaching @xmath2 ( eqs .",
    "( [ divxi],[sub.4 ] ) ) , the slowest possible growth , namely the one where @xmath81 is smaller , is obtained at @xmath79 .",
    "therefore by comparing @xmath56 for different values of @xmath0 one finds a non - monotonous behavior : the growth slows down in going from @xmath1 to @xmath79 and then speeds up again when @xmath0 is further increased from @xmath79 up to @xmath58 .",
    "this can represent a practical tool to identify @xmath2 .    in the next section",
    "we will show that a similar structure is observed also in @xmath87 .",
    "the details of the simulations are as follows .",
    "we have considered a three - dimensional square lattice system of @xmath88 sites , with @xmath89 for the sdim and @xmath90 for the bdim .",
    "we have checked that , with this choice , no finite - size effects can be detected in the time - regime accessed by the simulations . for every choice of the parameters , we have performed a certain number ( in the range 10 - 100 ) of independent runs with different initial conditions , disorder realizations and thermal histories in order to populate the non - equilibrium ensemble needed to extract average quantities .    to speed up the simulations we have used a modified dynamics where spin flips in the bulk of domains , namely those aligned with all the nearest neighbors ,",
    "are prevented .",
    "this modified dynamics does not alter the behavior of the quantities we are interested in , as has been tested in the @xmath71 version of the models and in a large number of different cases @xcite .",
    "we have checked that this is also true in the present study .",
    "let us start by considering the sdim .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath56 , for various dilution values , is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for the @xmath87-sdim .",
    "notice that we plot @xmath91 in order to normalize the curves at the microscopic time @xmath92 when the late - stage scaling regime is entered .    in the pure case the asymptotic power - law @xmath72 is expected . in the relatively small range of simulated times",
    "we measure a somewhat smaller exponent ( in the last decade a best fit procedure yields @xmath93 , as already reported in @xcite , because the convergence to the true asymptotic behavior is very slow , as explained in @xcite . indeed the observed _ effective",
    "_ exponent @xmath94 appears to increase with time .",
    "however here we are mainly interested in the non - monotonic behavior of the speed of growth for which an accurate estimate of @xmath95 is not necessary . in fact , it is clearly observed that , by increasing @xmath0 , the growth law becomes slower and slower up to a certain value of @xmath96 that , following @xcite , we identify with @xmath2 . for @xmath68 growth becomes faster upon increasing @xmath0 up to @xmath28 .",
    "this behavior results in a non - monotonic @xmath0-dependence of @xmath56 , at fixed time @xmath4 . this can be clearly appreciated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] where the behavior of the effective exponent obtained by fitting the data for various @xmath0 with a power - law ( regardless of the fact that the actual growth - law might not be power - law ) in the time - range @xmath97 .    having established the non - monotonous dependence of the speed of growth on @xmath0 , we make some comments on the form of the growth - law . at the dilution @xmath79 we observe a downwards banding of @xmath56 which indicates that the growth is slower than algebraic , suggesting in this case a logarithmic law .",
    "we recall that a form @xmath98 was predicted in a model with bond disorder in @xcite , which , however , due its slow character has never been accurately demonstrated , to the best of our knowledge , even in the less numerically demanding 2d cases .",
    "clearly in this @xmath87 case the task is much more demanding , and the time range accessible in the simulations is not sufficient for a precise determination of the analytical form of the growth - law .    for @xmath58 , on the other hand , the behavior of @xmath99 is well fitted , as expected , by a power - law @xmath100 , with @xmath101 . according to the discussion of sec .",
    "[ over ] , this behavior is expected irrespective of the quenching temperature ( but with a different temperature - dependent exponent @xmath102 ) , provided it is sufficiently low . in order to check this",
    "we have performed a series of simulations by fixing @xmath58 and changing @xmath67 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath56 in these cases is shown in fig .",
    "the data are consistent with power - laws for any choice of @xmath67 .",
    "notice however that for very small @xmath67 the power - law is decorated by a sort of log - time periodic oscillation .",
    "the exponent @xmath103 , obtained by fitting all the curves in the last decade ( for @xmath104 we use two decades in order to smear out the oscillation ) , is plotted in the inset . according to eq .",
    "( [ expt ] ) , one finds a linear behavior at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "fitting this curve we obtain @xmath105 ( eq.([expt ] ) ) .",
    "notice that for large values of the temperature this linear behavior breaks down , due to the constraint @xmath106 since it is impossible to grow faster than in the pure case .      in order to check the generality of the behaviors observed in the sdim we have performed a series of simulations also for the 3d - bdim .",
    "unfortunately , for this model it is not possible to find a region of sufficiently low temperatures to be considered representative of the @xmath55 limit , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ timev ] , but high enough to eliminate the stop and go behavior of the interfaces , which is responsible for the oscillatory character of @xmath56 .",
    "we have explored several values of @xmath107 , and in all cases we observe a non - monotonic behavior of @xmath56 as @xmath0 is varied . in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) we plot results for @xmath54 . for quenches at this temperature oscillations are clearly evident ruling out the possibility to make any statement on the form of the growth - law ( whether logarithmic or power - law ) . despite this , the non monotonic behavior of @xmath56 as @xmath0 is varied at fixed @xmath4 is quite evident from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . starting from the pure case @xmath1 , where a fast growth is observed (",
    "although much slower than the asymptotic expected behavior @xmath72 , due to the long - lasting pre - asymptotic corrections discussed above ) the growth gets slower as @xmath0 is increased up to @xmath108 , and then speeds up again until @xmath28 is reached .",
    "this shows that the non - monotonicity of the speed of growth as disorder is increased is a general property of diluted system , irrespective of dimension and of the kind of dilution .",
    "this suggests that an interpretation based on the presence of three fixed points , the pure one and those at @xmath2 and @xmath28 , and the attractive / repulsive nature of such fixed points , can be appropriated quite generally .",
    "in this paper we have studied the diluted ising model in three dimensions . the aim of the paper was to show the generality of the phase - ordering behavior previously observed in the 2d - sdim and 2d - bdim , where it was first shown @xcite the non - monotonous dependence of the speed of growth on the amount of disorder , a fact that was interpreted as due to the close relation between the coarsening properties and some topological features of the network in disordered magnets . in order to do that we have considered three - dimensional systems .",
    "our results show that the pattern of behavior observed in these models is analogous to the one found in the 2d sdim and rbim , and henceforth an analogous interpretation can be given . in the pure system phase - ordering occurs without activation energy by a smooth curvature - driven displacement of interfaces , leading to the well known growth - law @xmath72 .",
    "the situation changes radically as soon as disorder is introduced , because inhomogeneities pin the interfaces in energy minima and thermal activation is required to proceed . in @xcite an argument was developed leading to the conjecture that the @xmath56-dependence of the pinning barriers changes when passing from @xmath109 to @xmath58 , due to a radically different large - scale topology of the network which turns from a compact to a fractal object .",
    "this implies also a different growth - law , logarithmic for @xmath109 vs power - law @xmath110 right at @xmath28 . in a renormalization - group language",
    "this features can be accomodated in a framework with three fixed points , located at @xmath1 , @xmath79 and @xmath58 . accordingly , a crossover phenomenon is observed where , for any @xmath111 , @xmath56 changes from an early behavior associated to the nearest repulsive fixed point to the asymptotic logarithmic law .",
    "this gives rise to the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath56 as @xmath0 is varied keeping @xmath4 fixed .",
    "the presented numerical study suggests that the pattern of behaviors observed in @xcite is quite a general feature of ferromagnetic disordered systems .",
    "indeed we find that the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath56 is observed also in @xmath87 systems .",
    "our results also indicate that , at least for the sdim , @xmath99 exhibits a power law growth with a growth exponent @xmath112 inversely proportional to the temperature . the growth law becomes slower as @xmath0 is decreased to @xmath2 , even if our data do not allows the precise determination of a logarithmic growth for @xmath80 .",
    "it would be an interesting line of research to investigate if a similar structure underlies also the kinetics of other disordered systems such as , for instance , ising models with random fields .",
