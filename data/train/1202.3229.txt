    "in recent years fluctuation theorems that allow to infer equilibrium properties of a system from nonequilibrium processes have attracted considerable attention . the jarzynski equality  ( je )  @xcite reading @xmath0 provides a prominent example of these relations .",
    "it relates the free energy change @xmath1 to the statistics of work @xmath2 that is performed by a time - dependent force acting on a system that initially is prepared in a canonical equilibrium state at the temperature @xmath3 .",
    "the weight with which the average of the exponentiated work is performed is determined by the probability density function ( pdf ) of work , @xmath4 .",
    "it represents the frequency of outcomes from independent runs of the same force protocol starting in equilibrium at the same temperature .",
    "the free energy change @xmath1 gives the difference between free energies of the initial state and of a hypothetical thermal equilibrium state of the considered system at the initial temperature @xmath5 with clamped forces at the values at the end of the force protocol .",
    "first , the je was found for classical systems and later on confirmed for quantum mechanical systems  @xcite .    a similar form of the je holds for grand canonical initial states  ( gci ) which allow both energy and particle number fluctuations .",
    "it then takes the form  @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath2 and @xmath7 are defined as above .",
    "further , @xmath8 denotes the chemical potential of the reservoir , and @xmath9 the difference of the particle numbers at the end and at the beginning of the force protocol .",
    "similarly as the work @xmath2 also the particle number change @xmath9 is a random quantity .",
    "these random outcomes are described by a joint pdf @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 is given by the difference of the grand canonical potentials @xmath12 and @xmath13 which respectively correspond to the initial equilibrium state and to a hypothetical equilibrium state at the inverse temperature @xmath7 and chemical potential @xmath8 with clamped force values at the end of the force protocol .    while temperature is universally confined to positive values",
    ", the upper admissible bound of the chemical potential is system dependent .",
    "to illustrate this fact we consider a system of non - interacting identical particles for which the average particle number in a grand canonical potential at inverse temperature @xmath7 and chemical potential @xmath8 is determined by @xcite @xmath14 where the sum is performed over the single particle energy spectrum , and the @xmath15 and @xmath16 signs refer to fermi - dirac and bose - einstein statistics , respectively . considering the case of a single particle spectrum which is bounded from below by the ground state , for fermions , the @xmath15 sign guarantees the convergence of the sum for any real value of the chemical potential .",
    "however , for a system made of bosons , this sum only converges if the chemical potential is smaller than the ground state energy . with the divergence of the average particle number the grand canonical partition function diverges and",
    "accordingly the grand canonical potential becomes negatively divergent . in the context of the fluctuation theorem given by eq .",

    "there is no restriction for the finally reached trap curvature .",
    "in particular , the trap may be widened to such an extend that the ground state energy falls below the chemical potential of the initial state .",
    "then the hypothetical equilibrium state is not properly defined and formally leads to a divergent grand canonical partition function and a negative , divergent grand canonical potential . at the same time",
    "the exponential average of @xmath39 also diverges .",

    "note that this need not be expected since the gaussian approximation often fails to describe the wings of the work distribution with sufficient accuracy to conform with the jarzynski equality @xcite .      at sufficiently low temperatures",

    "hence , the jarzynski equality also holds for the approximate low temperature work pdf ( [ lowtemppdfdis ] ) . note that for protocols leading to a ground state @xmath118 less than the chemical potential @xmath8 formally leads to the nonsensical result of a negative ewa , indicating the actual divergence of the sum representing this average",
    "finally we note that for small values of the deformation parameter @xmath58 the spacing between the allowed values of the work becomes smaller suggesting to approximate the discrete work distribution by a continuous pdf which can be written as a generalized exponential pdf @xmath119 where @xmath120 denotes the heaviside step function . the average work @xmath121 follows from eq .",
    "( [ lowtemppdfdis ] ) as @xmath122 the sign of the average work is determined by that of @xmath58 : compressing the trap leads to positive , widening to negative work . in accordance with eq .",

    "we studied a subtlety of fluctuation theorems specific for bose particles which initially are prepared in a grand canonical equilibrium state .",
    "when the considered protocol finally leads to a hamiltonian whose ground state energy per particle is less than the chemical potential of the initial state then the hypothetical equilibrium state is ill defined and its corresponding grand canonical partition function and grand potential do not exist . for the statistics of work fluctuations",
    "this means that the exponential work average diverges in spite of the fact that the moments of the work of all orders are finite .",
    "in this situation the jarzynski equality looses its meaning and also the tasaki crooks relation becomes pointless because the initial equilibrium state for the backward process does not exist and therefore can not be prepared .    in order to illustrate this issue , we considered bose particles in a three dimensional harmonic trap and investigated the statistics of the work done by changing the trap curvature adiabatically .",
    "the probability distribution of the work at low temperatures follows a generalized exponential distribution which has a more pronounced tail than the gaussian work distribution which is valid at high temperatures .",
    "we presented analytic forms of the pdfs in the extreme temperature regimes , which are in good agreement with numerical results . in the intermediate regime",
