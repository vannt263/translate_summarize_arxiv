    "pure leptonic and semileptonic flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) rare b decays , @xmath20 have received much attention recent years due to clear backgrounds and ongoing experiments at babar  @xcite and belle and forthcoming projects at tevatron  @xcite and lhc  @xcite as well as sensitivity to models beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the current experimental result of br(@xmath1 ) by the belle collaboration  @xcite is @xmath21 and cdf  @xcite upper limit on br(@xmath0 ) is @xmath22    in the sm , these processes vanish at tree level , while they occur at one - loop level with the charged gauge boson @xmath23 and up - type quarks in the loop . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , there are five kinds of contributions to partonic level process @xmath24 at one - loop level , depending on specific particles propagated in the loop , ( @xmath25 ) standard model gauge boson @xmath23 and up - type quarks ( sm contribution ) ; ( @xmath26 ) charged higgs @xmath27 and up - type quarks ( charged higgs contribution ) ; ( @xmath28 ) chargino and scalar up - type quarks ( chargino contribution ) ; ( @xmath29 ) neutralino and scalar down - type quarks ( neutralino contribution ) ; ( @xmath30 ) gluino and scalar down - type quarks ( gluino contribution ) .",
    "the flavor structure of the sfermion sector in mssm depends on the soft terms which are determined by the supersymmetry breaking mechanism , in addition to the superpotential . in the minimal flavor violation ( mfv )",
    "scenarios of mssm , squarks are assumed to rotate in flavor bases aligned with the corresponding quark sector and the only source of flavor violation is the usual cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix in sm . in some mfv scenarios such as the constrained mssm ( msugra , string - inspired flipped su(5 ) , etc . ) and gauge mediation supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) where the soft terms at some high scale ( the grand unification scale or plank scale or messenger scale ) are characterized by the universality of sfermion masses and the proportionality of the trilinear terms , the flavor violation in sfermion sector at the electroweak ( ew ) scale is generated radiatively and consequently , in general , small .",
    "regions of the parameter space it becomes non - negligible  @xcite . ] therefore , comparing with the first three kinds of contributions , the last two kinds of contributions , i. e. , neutralino and gluino contributions , are negligible  @xcite .",
    "there are new sources of flavor violation in mssm . besides the ckm matrix , the the @xmath31 squark mass matrices are generally not diagonal in flavor ( generation ) indices in the super - ckm basis in which superfields are rotated in such a way that the mass matrices of the quark field components of the superfields are diagonal .",
    "this rotation non - alignment in the quark and squark sectors can induce large flavor off - diagonal couplings such as the coupling of gluino to the quark and squark which belong to different generations .",
    "there exist two different kinds of methods to deal with flavor changing vertices induced by flavor mixing in the squark mass matrices in the literature  @xcite .",
    "one works in quark and squark mass eigenstates with induced flavor changing couplings , so called `` vertex mixing '' ( vm ) .",
    "the other method , `` mass insertion approximation''(mia )  @xcite , works in flavor diagonal gaugino couplings @xmath32 and diagonal quark mass matrices with all the flavor changes rested on the off - diagonal sfermion propagators .",
    "the mia can be obtained in vm through taylor expansion of nearly degenerate squark masses @xmath33 around the common squark mass @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "thus mia can work well for nearly degenerate squark masses and , in general , its reliability can be checked only a posteriori . however , for its simplicity , it has been widely used as a model independent analysis to find the constraints on different off - diagonal parts of squark mass matrices from experiments  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that vm remains valid even when flavor off - diagonal squark mass matrix elements are large and there is no approximation which has been assumed .",
    "because the experiment of br(@xmath2 ) only constrains @xmath36 , with the overall sign flip of @xmath37 from mssm _ vs _ sm , the branch ratio of @xmath38 can be enhanced from the term re(@xmath39 ) in the constrained mssm with gluino and neutralino contributions neglected  @xcite , while in these analysis supersymmetry contributions to @xmath40 and @xmath13 are at most changed by @xmath41 compared with the sm values .",

    "@xmath38 has been analyzed in the left - right supersymmetric model recently  @xcite .",

    ", for @xmath43 , when @xmath18 is large and @xmath44 is not too large ( say , 250 gev ) , the nhbs contributions can become significant due to the @xmath45 enhancement of the corresponding wilson coefficients in some regions of the parameter space  @xcite and the nhbs contributions to @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( @xmath48 , @xmath43 ) in the constrained mssm have been investigated in refs .",

    "their effects are also negligible , as shown in ref .",
    "however , in mssm their effects can be significant , since the flavor non - diagonal squark mass matrix elements are free parameters . part of the primed counterparts of usual operators relevant to b rare leptonic and semileptonic decays have been considered in ref.@xcite .    in this paper , we extend our previous analyses to include gluino and neutralino contributions and all operators responsible for b rare leptonic and semileptonic decays in mssm .",
    "we calculate the wilson coefficients using the vm method and also give their expressions in mia to show different sources of enhancements .",
    "in numerical analyses we take into account constraints from br(@xmath2 ) , @xmath52 and the lower bounds of superpartner masses and higgs masses as well as @xmath53 and hadronic charmless @xmath54 decays .",
    "we have carefully analyzed different sources of enhancements of @xmath6 ( arising from the @xmath5 penguin ) and @xmath55 ( arising from the nhb penguins ) , related to the general scalar - down quark mass matrix .",
    "we find that under the experimental constraints , with large mixing of left - handed and right - handed sbottom , @xmath6 can be enhanced by about @xmath7 compared to the standard model in two cases , heavy gluino and fine - tuning between @xmath8(@xmath9 ) and @xmath10(@xmath11 ) terms in @xmath12 .",
    "in particular , @xmath13 and @xmath14 can reach a @xmath15 enhancement in some regions of parameters under experimental constraints .",
    "when cp - odd higgs @xmath16 is not too heavy ( @xmath17gev ) , and @xmath18 is large ( @xmath19 ) , neutral higgs boson penguins with gluino and down - type squark in the loop can significantly contribute to the @xmath3 transition and the contributions can compete with those due to the chargino and scalar up - type quark loop .",

    "we present @xmath59 scale wilson coefficients @xmath73 and @xmath74 in appendix . in order to see the dependences of wilson coefficients on new flavor violation parameters , as an illustration , we present all the relevant wilson coefficients at the @xmath72 scale induced by gluino in mia as follows @xmath75 where @xmath76 ( @xmath77 is the scalar quark mass matrix , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80",
