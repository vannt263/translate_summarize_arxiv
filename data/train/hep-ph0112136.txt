    "in other words , why is the universe so big , flat and old ( @xmath2 years ) , homogeneous and isotropic ( @xmath3 ) , why does it contain so much entropy and does not contain unwanted relics ? these puzzles of classical cosmology were solved with invention of inflation @xcite .",
    "stress - energy tensor @xmath4 which drives the expansion of a homogeneous universe can be characterised by two parameters , energy density , @xmath5 , and pressure @xmath6 .",
    "conservation of energy and momentum @xmath7 in an expanding friedmann universe takes a simple form @xmath8 here @xmath9 is a hubble parameter , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is a scale factor which describes the expansion of the universe . consider the stress - energy tensor @xmath12 of a vacuum .",
    "vacuum has to be lorentz invariant , hence @xmath13 and we find @xmath14@xmath15 .",
    "therefore , the energy of a vacuum stays constant despite the expansion . in this way ,",
    "room for matter full of energy could have being created .",
    "it remains to find out how vacuum energy was converted into radiation at some later stage .",
    "the size of a causally connected region ( horizon ) scales in proportion to time , @xmath16 . on the other hand ,",
    "the physical size of a given patch grows in proportion to the scale factor , @xmath17 .",
    "exponent @xmath18 depends upon equation of state , @xmath19 for radiation and @xmath20 for matter dominated expansion . in any case , for the `` classical '' friedmann universe @xmath21 and horizon expands faster than volume .",
    "take the largest visible patch today .",
    "it follows that in the past it should have contained many casually disconnected regions and the question arises why the universe is so homogeneous at large scales ?",
    "this problem can be solved if during some period of time the volume had expanded faster than the horizon . during such a period",
    "the whole visible universe can be inflated from one ( `` small '' ) causally connected region .",
    "clearly , this happens if @xmath22 , which means @xmath23 .",
    "either of these two conditions can be used as definition of an inflationary regime .    using the einstein equation @xmath24",
    "we find that the inflationary stage is realized when @xmath25 .",
    "if @xmath26 we have de sitter metric and the universe expands exponentially .    a crucial and testable prediction of inflationary cosmology is a flat universe , @xmath27 ( as usual , @xmath28 is the ratio of current and critical energy densities , @xmath29 ) .",
    "indeed , einstein equations can be cast into the form @xmath30 .",
    "accelerated expansion , @xmath23 , increases @xmath31 and therefore drives @xmath32 to 1 .",
    "the first model of inflation was de - facto suggested in @xcite .",
    "de sitter expansion appeared as a result of vacuum polarization effects in a one - loop order  too complicated to be sure that higher order corrections are unimportant .",
    "consider @xmath12 of a real scalar field @xmath33 @xmath34 with the lagrangian @xmath35 . in a state when all derivatives of @xmath33 are negligible , @xmath36 , the stress - energy tensor of a scalar field is that of a vacuum , @xmath37 .",
    "there are two basic ways to arrange @xmath38 const and hence to imitate the vacuum - like state .",
    "the simplest possibility was suggested by a. guth in his original paper @xcite . consider potential @xmath39 which has a local minimum with a non - zero energy density separated from the true ground state by a potential barrier .",
    "the universe will be trapped in the meta - stable minimum for a while and expansion will diminish all field gradients .",
    "then the universe enters a vacuum state .",
    "subsequent phase transition into the true minimum ends inflation and creates the radiation phase . today the model of guth and its variants based on potential barriers is good for illustration purposes only .",
    "it did not stand up to observations since inhomogeneities which are created during the phase transition into the radiation phase are too large @xcite .",
    "a. linde was first to realise that things work in the simplest possible set up @xcite .",
    "consider potential @xmath40 equation of the field motion in expanding universe is @xmath41 if @xmath42 the `` friction '' is too big and the field ( almost ) does not move .",
    "therefore time derivatives in @xmath43 can be neglected and inflation starts ( in sufficiently homogeneous patch of the universe ) .",
    "hubble parameter in this case is given by @xmath44 and we see that inflation starts if initial field value happen to satisfy @xmath45 . during inflationary stage",
    "the field slowly rolls down the potential hill .",
    "this motion is very important in the theory of structure creation .",
    "inflation ends when @xmath46 . at this time",
    "field oscillations start around potential minimum and latter decay into radiation . in this way matter",
    "was likely created in our universe .",
    "small fluctuations of any field obey @xmath47\\ ; u_k = 0 \\ , .",
    "\\label{modeq}\\ ] ] effective mass is time dependent here because of the expansion of the universe . because @xmath48 is time dependent , it is not possible to keep fluctuations in vacuum .",
    "if one arranges to put oscillators with momentum @xmath49 into the vacuum , they will not be in vacuum at a latter time since this vacuum would correspond to wrong value of the field mass .",
    "some remarks are in order :    * eq .  ( [ modeq ] ) is valid for all particle species * equation looks that simple in conformal reference frame @xmath50 . everywhere in this chapter",
    "a `` dot '' means derivative with respect to @xmath51 .",
    "* of particular interest are ripples of space - time itself * * curvature fluctuations ( scalar fluctuations of the metric ) * * gravitons ( tensor fluctuations of the metric ) * @xmath48 may be non - zero even for massless fields * * graviton is the simplest example @xcite , @xmath52 * * @xmath53 for curvature fluctuations has similar structure @xcite with @xmath54 being replaced by @xmath55 * for conformally coupled , but massive scalar @xmath56    creation was only possible because nature is not conformally - invariant .",
    "otherwise @xmath57 and vacuum remains vacuum forever .",
    "amplitudes @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( [ modeq ] ) are quantum operators and a theory of creation reduces to the theory of bogolyubov transformations or to a theory of particle creation in homogeneous time varying classical background .",
    "there are two important instances of such background in cosmology :    * expansion of space - time , @xmath59 * motion of the inflaton field , @xmath60    both can be operational at any epoch of creation    * during inflation * while the inflaton oscillates ( reheating )    during inflation superhorizon size perturbations of metric are created which give seeds for large scale structure ( lss ) formation and eventually lead to formation of galaxies , the solar system and all the rest which we can see around us . during reheating matter itself",
    "is created .",
    "overall there are four different situations ( two sources times two epochs )",
    ". if coupling to the inflaton is not essential , the corresponding process will be called `` pure gravitational creation '' in what follows .",
    "let me consider all four possibilities in turn , starting from      during inflation the motion of the inflaton field is slow , while the expansion of the universe is fast .",
    "it follows that relevant cosmological scales encompass small @xmath61 interval .",
    "e.g. in the model eq .",
    "( [ chaotic ] ) the whole visible universe is inflated away while the inflaton field @xmath33 changes from @xmath62 to @xmath63 .",
    "potential @xmath39 should be relatively `` flat '' over this range of @xmath61 to maintain the inflationary regime .",
    "we may conclude that observables should essentially depend on a first few derivatives of @xmath64 and the shape of the potential outside this region of @xmath61 is irrelevant .",
    "one may construct dimensionless quantities ( slow roll parameters ) out of potential derivatives @xmath65 the value of potential itself during this period is also relevant and defines the value of the hubble parameter , @xmath66",
    ".    solutions of eq .",
    "( [ modeq ] ) with vacuum initial conditions give for the power spectra of scalar ( curvature ) and tensor ( gravity waves ) perturbations @xmath67 these spectra can be approximated as power law functions @xmath68 where scale dependence @xmath49 enters via weak dependence of @xmath9 on the current field value ( current means here corresponding to the moment when the scale gets bigger than the horizon and evolution of the mode @xmath49 freezes out ) .",
    "one expects spectra to be nearly scale invariant since the field ( almost ) does not move . indeed , expanding in slow roll parameters one finds @xmath69      according to eqs .",
    "( [ stspectra ] ) the ratio of power in tensor to scalar perturbations is equal to @xmath70 . on the other hand",
    "the exponent of tensor perturbations is also proportional to @xmath71 , see eq .",
    "( [ nsntslowroll ] ) .",
    "this gives `` consistency relation '' , @xmath72 where the ratio of tensor to scalar power is expressed through the ratio of directly measurable respective contributions to quadrupole cmbr anisotropy , @xmath73 .",
    "verification of the consistency relation should give major peace of evidence that the inflation did happened .",
    "predictions of inflationary theory can be tested measuring cmbr anisotropy and power spectra of galaxies distribution .",
    "all tests completed so far are in agreement with predictions .",
    "latest cmbr data @xcite imply that the universe is flat @xmath74 .",
    "the spectrum of perturbations is nearly scale invariant , @xmath75 , and gaussian @xcite .",
    "overall normalisation of cmbr spectrum fixes inflaton parameters . in the simplest case of eq .",
    "( [ chaotic ] ) @xmath76 gev .",
    "consistency relation was not tested yet since it requires measurement of tensor perturbations . in forthcoming cmbr experiments tensor and",
    "scalar modes may be disentangled .",
    "this can be done unambiguously because tensor and scalar perturbations contribute differently to the polarisation of cmbr ( for a review see @xcite ) which hopefully will be measured .    measured position of the first acoustic peak in cmbr not only tells us that the universe is flat , but also that the isocurvature perturbations are ruled out as the primary block of structure formation . while during inflation both types of perturbations , curvature and isocurvature , can be produced , the models which do not involve inflation ( e.g. network of cosmic strings ) produce isocurvature fluctuations .",
    "therefore this is an important test of inflation @xcite . in principle ,",
    "curvature perturbations may be mimicked by causal processes @xcite , but polarisation measurements will also give unambiguous proof that density perturbations are of superhorazon origin @xcite .",
    "while the tensor mode is not measured yet , it is restricted by cmbr anisotropy measurements .",
    "different models of inflation occupy well defined and different regions in the ( r , n ) parameter plane @xcite , see eqs .",
    "( [ srpar ] ) , ( [ nsntslowroll ] ) .",
    "regions , specified for new @xcite , chaotic @xcite and hybrid @xcite inflationary models are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : regionsanddata ] .",
    "other inflationary models are also bounded to these regions .",
    "for example , `` natural '' inflation @xcite fits the region of `` new '' inflationary model .",
    "parameter space favoured by current cmbr and lss measurements is also shown @xcite as a shaded area ( note however that size and shape of this region depends upon priors used ) .",
    "e.g. , for the @xmath77 chaotic inflation model all this means that @xmath78 at 99% c.l .",
    "@xcite , while the hybrid model of inflation is disfavoured .",
    "let us consider the gravitational creation of matter .",
    "the source of creation is @xmath79 .",
    "while matter is created in tiny amounts by this process , it is most effective for heaviest particles .",
    "if such superheavy particles do exist in nature , this process naturally leads to superheavy dark matter ( sdm ) @xcite .",
    "if these particles are unstable but long lived , they can explain @xcite puzzling ultra - high energy cosmic ray ( uhecr ) events .",
    "it is particle mass which couples quantum fluctuations to the background expansion and serves as the source of particle creation .",
    "therefore we expect for the abundance of super - heavy particles @xmath80 it is the expansion of the universe which causes particle creation , therefore creation is most efficient at time @xmath81 when @xmath82 , while ( comoving ) particle number is an adiabatic invariant at later times .",
    "we expect that coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ nxfr ] ) should not be much smaller unity if we normalize @xmath83 .",
    "it follows that stable particles with @xmath84 gev will overclose the universe if there was friedmann singularity in the past  friedmann cosmology and sdm mutually exclude each other @xcite .",
    "in inflationary cosmology there is no singularity and the hubble constant is limited , @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , the production of particles with @xmath86 gev is suppressed .",
    "the present day ratio of the energy density in @xmath87-particles to the critical energy density is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gravcr ] @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "super - heavy particles with the mass @xmath88 are excellent candidates for sdm and progenitors of uhecr . if it will be proven that uhecr are due to decays of sdm , it will mean that friedmann expansion was preceded by some other epoch , likely by inflation .    consistency with observations",
    "requires @xmath89 .",
    "we see that light particles , @xmath90 gev , are overproduced by many orders of magnitude , unless their coupling to curvature is conformal @xmath91 .",
    "this poses a serious danger @xcite since supresymmetry and suprgravity models predict many such particles , e.g. moduli , gravitino , etc",
    ". they may be dangerous relics , even if unstable , since they can easily survive to post - nucleosinthesis epoch and their decay products destroy @xmath92he and d nuclei by photodissociation @xcite .          while bosons and fermions are created equally efficiently by a pure gravitational mechanism , coupling to inflaton",
    "uncovers deep differences between them .",
    "effective mass of a scalar @xmath93 ( interaction lagrangian @xmath94 ) and of a fermion @xmath95 ( interaction lagrangian @xmath96 ) is given by the following expressions @xmath97 effective mass of a scalar @xmath93 depends quadratically upon the inflaton field strength and therefore it is always larger than the bare mass @xmath98 .",
    "in the case of fermions inflaton field strength enters linearly and effective mass can cross zero .",
    "even superheavy fermions can be created easily during these moments of zero crossing @xcite .",
    "( it is easier to create a light field and it is effective mass which counts at creation . at the end of the day",
    "it is bare mass which counts . )",
    "coupling @xmath99 by itself is not relevant for the process of creation , @xmath99 always comes in combination with inflaton field strength . to make dimensionless combination out of it we have to re - scale @xmath100 by a typical time scale relevant for creation . in the present case",
    "this will be period of inflaton oscillations or inverse inflaton mass @xmath101 parameter q determines the strength of particle production caused by the oscillations of the inflaton field .",
    "it can be very large @xcite even when @xmath99 is small since @xmath102 .",
    "bose - stimulation aids the process of creation of bosons .",
    "occupation numbers grow exponentially with time , @xmath103 , which results in a fast , explosive decay of inflaton @xcite and creates large classical fluctuations of all bose - fields involved .",
    "this can have a number of observable consequences : non - thermal phase transitions @xcite , generation of a stochastic background of the gravitational waves @xcite , and a possibility for a novel mechanism of baryogenesis @xcite are some examples .    fortunately , the system in this regime of particle creation became classical and can be studied on a lattice @xcite .    on the other hand in the case of fermions @xmath104 at all times because of the pauli blocking .",
    "this may create an impression that the fermionic channel of inflaton decay is not important .",
    "this is a false impression @xcite .",
    "production of fermions can be more efficient compared to bosons @xcite .",
    "vanishing effective mass allows for a larger fermi - momentum of created particles and fermions can outnumber bosons .",
    "a fraction of the initial energy density which goes to bosons and fermions respectively is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bvf ] as a function of particle mass for several values of @xmath105 .",
    "indeed , superheavy fermions are more efficiently created compared to bosons at the same value of @xmath105 .          bosons of moderate or small mass ( compared to inflaton ) , and sufficiently large coupling ( @xmath106 or @xmath107 @xcite ) are produced explosively , their density grows exponentially .",
    "field variances , @xmath108 , can reach large values , larger than in a thermal equilibrium at the same energy density .",
