    "this expression is @xmath209 unless @xmath210 .",

    "the de finetti theorem for test spaces is rather general .",
    "very little goes into the definition of a test space itself .",
    "in fact , in the finite dimensional case we are considering , the state space of an individual system may be an arbitrary compact convex set . thus the most substantive assumptions that go into the theorem are those that concern how test spaces combine when joint systems are considered .    in the classical case ,",
    "the test space @xmath45 contains a single test and the state space for an individual system is @xmath13 , where @xmath0 is the number of elements of @xmath35 . in this case",
    ", the nonsignalling condition is redundant because there is just a single test on each system and hence no freedom to choose alternative measurements .",
    "the cartesian product of classical test spaces corresponds to the usual cartesian product of sample spaces and so theorem  [ testdefinetti ] reduces to theorem  [ classicaldefinetti ] straightforwardly .",
    "the quantum case is a little more subtle because the state of @xmath1 quantum systems belongs to the state space of @xmath213 , rather than the state space of the cartesian product of @xmath1 test spaces of the form @xmath214 .",
    "nevertheless , a quantum state defined by a density operator on @xmath215 is uniquely specified by the probabilities for measurement outcomes of the form @xmath216 , where the @xmath217 are projection operators .",
    "it follows that the states on @xmath213 can be identified with a subset of the nonsignalling states on @xmath218 .",
    "hence theorem  [ testdefinetti ] implies the quantum de finetti theorem .    as a further illustration of the generality of the result",
    ", we note that a theorem for classical processes , or conditional probabilities , can also be viewed as a special case of theorem  [ testdefinetti ] .",
    "a process @xmath219 can be thought of as taking an input @xmath220 into an output @xmath221 , where @xmath220 takes values in @xmath222 and @xmath221 takes values in @xmath223 .",

    "[ boxgreechie ] .    ]",
    "the state space of this test space is isomorphic to the set of conditional probability distributions via the identification @xmath229 .",
    "more generally , a process @xmath230 takes inputs @xmath231 into outputs @xmath232 , where each @xmath233 takes values in @xmath222 , and each @xmath234 takes values in @xmath223 .",
    "such a @xmath230 can be defined as the set of conditional probabilities of the form @xmath235 , and can also be identified with a state on the cartesian product @xmath236 . the n - fold nonsignalling and symmetry conditions can be defined for @xmath230 exactly as they are in definitions  [ nonsigdef ] and [ symmetricdef ] .",
    "exchangeability for a sequence @xmath237 can be defined exactly as in definition  [ exchangedef ] .",

    ".    a couple of remarks regarding theorem  [ conddefinetti ] might be helpful .",
    "first , we described theorem  [ conddefinetti ] as a special case of theorem  [ testdefinetti ] .",
    "it is worth noting the sense in which it is strictly less general .",
    "after all , any state on any test space could be thought of as a classical process , which takes an input ( choice of test ) into an output ( outcome of test ) .",
    "the point is that , with this identification applied to a generic test space @xmath42 , not all sets of conditional probabilities @xmath239 will correspond to valid states on @xmath42 .",
    "it is only if @xmath42 has the special feature that the tests are non - overlapping that this will be the case .",
    "the integral in eq.([condindep ] ) ranges over all processes of the form @xmath239 , whereas in eq.([mainres : dff ] ) , it is important that the integral ranges only over @xmath43 .",
    "second , the de finetti theorem for classical processes can be viewed as a de finetti theorem for _ states _ in a theory that is non - classical and non - quantum , but admits the most general type of correlations compatible with the nonsignalling requirement .",
    "this theory is discussed in @xcite , where it is called generalized non - signalling theory .",
    "it admits superquantum correlations , which have been discussed in the quantum information literature under the name popescu - rohrlich , or nonlocal , boxes . of course , as in the quantum case , exchangeable states do not actually exhibit such correlations , since the de finetti theorem shows that they are separable .",
    "the de finetti theorem for test spaces holds thanks to a number of assumptions concerning how systems combine to make joint systems .",
    "one of these is the nonsignalling condition for joint states .",
    "others are encoded in the formal definition of a cartesian product of test spaces .",
    "it is interesting to see what happens when these assumptions are relaxed , so in this section we present a number of cases where the theorem fails .",
    "first , the assumption that the joint states are nonsignalling is crucial not only in the proof , but in the very definition of exchangeability . in general , if a state @xmath240 is signalling , then it is not possible to define marginal states @xmath125 and @xmath241 .",
    "but exchangeability requires that , given the @xmath31th state in the sequence , the marginal state of the first @xmath1 systems should be defined and should equal the @xmath1th state .",
    "in fact , if a state @xmath240 is only signalling in one direction then one of the marginals can be defined .",
    "for example , if probabilities of outcomes for system 2 depend on which test was performed on system 1 , but not vice versa , then @xmath125 is well defined .",
    "but such a state is not symmetric , thus could not form part of an exchangeable sequence .",
    "arguably , the possibility of performing tests on one system that do not affect the other is part and parcel of what we mean when we speak of separate systems ( or separate trials ) .",
    "implicit in the definition of the cartesian product of test spaces is the idea that a test on one system can be regarded as simultaneous with a test on the other system .",
    "one can certainly imagine rules for combining systems where this is not the case . as a very simple example , consider two classical bits which have combined in the following strange manner .",
    "if bit 1 is measured before bit 2 , then the bits are found to be @xmath242 or @xmath243 with equal probability . on the other hand , if bit 2 is measured before bit 1 , then the outcomes are @xmath244 and @xmath245 with equal probability .",
    "note that a suitable no - signalling condition is satisfied and it is possible to define marginal states for these bits . with more complicated test spaces",
    "one can construct examples like this which are also symmetric .",
    ", with outcomes @xmath246 , and two tests corresponding to @xmath247 , and @xmath248 .",
    "suppose that there are two systems , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , each described by the test space @xmath42 , and that they have combined as follows . if the test @xmath249 is performed on both systems , the outcomes are completely random and uncorrelated .",
    "if the test @xmath250 is performed on both systems , then the outcomes are completely random and uncorrelated . on the other hand ,",
    "if the test @xmath249 is performed on either one of the systems , followed by @xmath250 on the other , then the joint outcomes are @xmath251 or @xmath252 with equal probability .",
    "if the test @xmath250 is performed on either one of the systems , followed by @xmath249 on the other , then the joint outcomes are @xmath253 or @xmath254 with equal probability .",
    "it is clear that this peculiar bipartite system does not allow signalling and is also invariant under a permutation of the two systems . ]",
    "we leave open the status of the de finetti theorem in such cases .",
    "another assumption that is implicit in the cartesian product of test spaces is that the joint state of two systems is completely specified by the probabilities for the joint outcomes @xmath74 of each pair of local tests @xmath85",
    ".    one can construct theories in which a joint state does indeed determine such probabilities , but is not completely specified by them .",
    "there are extra degrees of freedom , bound up in the two systems , which are inaccessible unless some kind of joint operation involving both systems at once is performed .    as discussed in @xcite , a clear example of this",
    "is provided by a modification of quantum theory in which real hilbert spaces are used rather than complex hilbert spaces .",
    "states and observables correspond to real symmetric , rather than complex hermitian , operators . for a @xmath129-dimensional system ( a _ rebit _ ) , there are measurements corresponding to @xmath255- and @xmath256-spin but not @xmath257-spin . in this case , if @xmath258 is the usual pauli matrix , then @xmath259 is an allowed state of two rebits .",
    "but the only way it can be distinguished from @xmath260 is if a joint observable such as @xmath261 is measured .",
    "note that in real quantum theory , this really is a joint observable : it can not be measured via a separate @xmath258 measurement on each system .    in @xcite",
    "it is shown explicitly that the de finetti theorem fails in real quantum theory .",
    "if @xmath23 is defined by @xmath262 then it is real and symmetric , and the sequence @xmath22 is exchangeable .",
    "but by the de finetti theorem for complex quantum theory , the right hand side of eq .",
    "is the unique de finetti representation for this sequence .",
    "in this paper , an infinite de finetti theorem for test spaces has been presented , which generalizes both the classical and quantum de finetti theorems . to illustrate the generality of the result ,",
    "we have shown that a de finetti theorem for classical processes , which may also be interpreted as a de finetti theorem for nonlocal boxes , follows as a special case .    from a practical point of view , proving theorems for test spaces , rather than just for quantum theory , confers significant advantages . not only do we achieve a unification of the classical and quantum results , but we also obtain results that apply to essentially arbitrary convex sets .",
    "this is potentially relevant when technological limitations prevent the preparation of arbitrary quantum states of certain systems , so that there is an effective restriction to a convex subset .    from a foundational point of view",
    ", this work can be seen as part of a project of understanding what is responsible for the enhanced information processing power of quantum theory , and for the project of deriving quantum theory from information theoretic axioms . in particular ,",
    "if one adopts a subjective bayesian approach to probability , it might be desirable to impose the requirement that , in any reasonable theory , one should be able to make sense of the idea of reconstructing an unknown state of a system by making repeated measurements . having a de finetti theorem for test spaces means that this does indeed make sense for theories in this framework , and that the existing approaches to bayesian state tomography in quantum theory would generalize straightforwardly .",
    "there are various directions for future work",
    ". it would be useful to produce a finite de finetti theorem for test spaces .",
    "it would also be useful to establish whether a ( finite or infinite ) de finetti theorem holds without the assumption made here of finite dimensionality of state spaces .",
    "finally , as discussed in section  [ not : sim ] , it might be interesting to explore the status of de finetti - type theorems in cases where systems combine in non - standard ways",
    ".    _ note added . _",
    "related results have recently been obtained by m.  christandl and b.  toner @xcite , who derive a de finetti theorem for classical processes , analogous to theorem  [ conddefinetti ] of the present work , but extended to the finite case .",
