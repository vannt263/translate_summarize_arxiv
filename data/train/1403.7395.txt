    "in recent years , the study of the entanglement between subregions has been identified as a promising theoretical probe of the quantum correlations in strongly correlated many - body quantum systems .",
    "of particular interest in this respect is the identification of universal contributions to the scaling of the entanglement entropy with the size of the boundary that separates the subregions .",
    "the dominant contribution to the bipartite entanglement entropy in quantum systems beyond one spatial dimension generically scales proportional to the area of the boundary that separates two subregion  @xcite ( however , there are several notable exceptions  @xcite ) . accounting for all microscopic degrees of freedom along the boundary ,",
    "the corresponding area - law scaling coefficient is non - universal , so that the extraction of subleading corrections beyond the area law is required in order to explore possible universal contributions . for one - dimensional quantum systems ,",
    "a detailed understanding of the entanglement entropy scaling has been well established . in particular , for gapped one - dimensional systems a finite entanglement entropy relates to the one - dimensional version of the area law , while quantum critical systems exhibit a logarithmically divergent ( in the subsystem s length ) entanglement entropy with the scaling coefficient determined by the central charge of the corresponding conformal field theory  @xcite .    advancing beyond the one - dimensional case ,",
    "several subleading contributions to the entanglement entropy of two - dimensional quantum systems have been considered recently ( cf .",
    "for a recent overview ) : e.g. , in gapped systems , a universal finite subleading contribution relates to the topology of the entangled state in topologically ordered phases , and gives rise to a topological entanglement entropy constant e.g. for spin liquid ground states  @xcite .",
    "subleading logarithmic ( in the boundary length ) terms have been identified in continuous - symmetry broken phases  @xcite and were suggested to derive in a universal way from the presence of goldstone modes through the restoration of the symmetry on finite geometries  @xcite .",
    "in addition , subleading logarithmic corrections appear due to specific geometric features such as corners or vertices on the subregion boundary , and were found to depend on universal characteristics e.g. at several standard examples of conformal two - dimensional quantum critical points  @xcite .",
    "much of the recent progress in identifying universal contributions to the entanglement entropy has been made possible by combining analytical and field - theoretical results with advanced numerical methods to extract entanglement properties of specific interacting quantum lattice models employing e.g. series expansion methods  @xcite , density matrix renormalization group  @xcite calculations  @xcite , as well as quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest in this respect are model systems exhibiting a quantum phase transition that separates distinct quantum phases .",
    "several recent studies considered the two - dimensional transverse - field ising model , which allows to probe the entanglement properties in a system with well - characterized phases and separated by a quantum critical point that belongs to the three - dimensional ising model universality class  @xcite . another basic quantum spin model that exhibits",
    "a well - characterized quantum phase transition is the spin - half heisenberg model on the square - lattice bilayer .",
    "in contrast to the transverse - field ising model , this model exhibits a _ continuous _ internal symmetry , and correspondingly , it has a quantum critical point of ( three - dimensional ) o(3 ) universality  @xcite . here",
    ", we apply qmc simulations to compute the rnyi  @xcite entropy - based bipartite entanglement measure in the spin - half heisenberg model on the square - lattice bilayer and study its entanglement properties both in the magnetically ordered and disordered phase as well as at the quantum critical point .",
    "in addition to analyzing the dominant area - law contribution to the entanglement entropy in this model upon varying the interaction ratio between the inter- and intralayer exchange interactions , we also analyze the contributions to the entanglement entropy that arise due to goldstone modes as well as corner contributions and which are considered to be universal .",
    "recently , the heisenberg bilayer model was examined at its quantum critical point using a numerical linked cluster expansion approach with a focus towards the contribution of @xmath1 corners in the subregion boundary to the entanglement entropy  @xcite , and we will relate to these results further below .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in the next section we introduce the model and subregions under consideration as well as the numerical method that we employ to calculate the entanglement entropy .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "iii , we present our numerical data for the entanglement properties and possible universal contributions . sec .",
    "iv provides a final discussion of our findings .",
    "in the following , we consider the spin - half heisenberg model on the square - lattice bilayer , described by the hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the @xmath3-th unit cell containing two spin - half degrees of freedom and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) the intralayer ( interlayer ) exchange interaction . we denote by @xmath6 the ratio of the interlayer to the intralayer exchange interactions . from previous studies ,",
    "it is well established , that the critical coupling ratio @xmath7 separates the low-@xmath8 antiferromagnetically ordered phase from the high-@xmath8 magnetically disordered dimer spin singlet phase .",
    "the quantum phase transition at @xmath9 belongs to the three - dimensional o(3 ) universality class , and has been well characterized  @xcite .",
    "the bilayer system will be considered in the following as a square - lattice model with a two - spin unit cell , one corresponding to each layer . for the quantum monte carlo simulations ,",
    "we then consider finite lattices of linear extend @xmath10 , containing @xmath11 square lattice sites ( i.e. bilayer unit cells ) and @xmath12 spins , with periodic boundary conditions employed in both lattice directions , corresponding to a toroidal simulation cell .    in order to study the entanglement properties of this model within both phases and at criticality",

    "this approach allows us to efficiently obtain @xmath17 from a direct calculation at a chosen inverse temperature @xmath18 , without the need to perform any thermodynamic integration or extended thermal ensemble sampling  @xcite .",

    "is expected to arise due to the presence of these corners .",
    "we focus in the following on these two differently shaped subregions , since the linear size of both scales with the size of the simulation cell while keeping a constant aspect - ratio .",
    "any contribution of the entanglement entropy @xmath17 that depends only on the aspect - ratio of the subregion thus leads to an @xmath26-independent contribution to @xmath17 for both considered subregions .",
    "different functional forms for the aspect ratio - dependence of such separate shape - dependent contributions have been considered for specific model systems , and we refer to ref .   for a recent comparison of these functional forms for a two - dimensional quantum critical system .",
    "we performed qmc simulations at various values of @xmath8 across the quantum phase transition at @xmath9 , with @xmath8 ranging between @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and for system sizes @xmath29 , for which we obtained data with a relative statistical uncertainty of @xmath30 .",

    "most pronounced throughout the low-@xmath8 , antiferromagnetically ordered region .",
    "we remark that at @xmath33 the system decouples into two independent layers , so that the values of @xmath17 for the bilayer at @xmath33 are exactly twice the values for a single square lattice layer of the same linear extend @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , in the large-@xmath8 limit , in which the system s ground state decouples into a direct product state of singlets formed on the spin dimers in each unit cell , @xmath17 vanishes for both subregion geometries , since the subregion boundaries in both cases do not cut through these dimers .",
    "the reduction of @xmath17 in the large-@xmath8 region makes the qmc simulations less efficient for even larger values of @xmath8 than those that we considered , since the ensemble exchange rate , essentially quantifying the entanglement entropy , drops significantly in this regime .     as a function of the boundary length @xmath26 at different values of the coupling ratio @xmath8 for strip and square shaped subregions . ]",

    "for the entanglement entropy a general scaling formula is given as @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the coefficient of the leading area law contribution .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction already , the prefactor @xmath39 of the logarithmic term may receive contributions due to goldstone modes e.g. in the antiferromagnetically ordered region with spontaneously broken su(2 ) symmetry as well as due to corner in e.g. the boundaries of the square subregions .",
    "furthermore , we include a constant term ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "as noted in the introduction , a finite constant contribution to @xmath17 is expected e.g. in topologically ordered systems with a finite topological entanglement entropy .",
    "the gapped phase for @xmath41 in the present model is topologically trivial , being adiabatically linked to the direct dimer - singlet phase in the large-@xmath8 limit , and thus exhibits no such topological entropy term  @xcite . also for quantum critical systems , finite constant contributions",
    "have been calculated , which depend e.g. on the boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath40 may also receive a shape - contribution depending on the aspect - ratio , which then makes a direct interpretation of the actual value of @xmath40 in terms of possible universal contributions difficult , given that a full characterization of the aspect - ratio dependence has not been achieved yet . depending on the range of available system sizes ,",
    "one may also require to include further subleading finite - size corrections to the thus far considered terms , which scale with the inverse length @xmath42 .     of the second rnyi entropy @xmath17 as a function of the coupling ratio @xmath8 for strip and",

    "a fit of our data for @xmath55 to the the standard value of the correlation length exponent @xmath56 ( ref .  ) entering the above scaling relation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : avsj ] , while an unbiased algebraic fit to our data returns a lower value of @xmath57 .",

    "for the strip subregions with smooth boundaries and no corners , a logarithmic term is expected from the presence of goldstone modes in the antiferromagnetically ordered regime : in accord with the numerical observation of subleading logarithmic contributions in the square lattice heisenberg model  @xcite , the authors of ref .   put forward a universal subleading logarithmic contribution in systems with spontaneously broken continuous symmetry equal to @xmath59 , where @xmath60 denotes the number of goldstone modes . in two dimensions , @xmath53 , and for the @xmath61 su(2 ) symmetry breaking within the finite-@xmath8 region , this leads to a contribution with @xmath62 , while at @xmath33 , where the symmetry is trivially enhanced to a su(2 ) @xmath63 su(2 ) symmetry due to the decoupling of the layers , we obtain @xmath64 and thus twice the above value , i.e. @xmath65 .     of the second rnyi entropy @xmath17 of a strip subregion as a function of the boundary length @xmath26 at different values of the coupling ratio @xmath8 . ]    to assess the statistical signature for possible subleading logarithmic terms with respect to the qmc statistical uncertainties , we show in fig .",

    "the qmc data for the strip subregions is consistent with the absence of a logarithmic term , as the residuals fluctuate about zero on a scale of the order of the statistical uncertainties . on the other hand , when fitting the qmc data for the strip subregion to the scaling formula @xmath68 , i.e. including a logarithmic term , we obtain the values of @xmath39 given in fig .",

    "close to criticality , the fitted values of @xmath39 show a spread of values near @xmath70 . for @xmath41 , we obtain small , negative values for @xmath39 ; at some values of @xmath8 within this regime , the fitted values furthermore deviate strongly and even in sign among the two different fitting ranges .",
    "this indicates , that those finite , negative values of @xmath39 result from overfitting to the statistical noise in our data instead of indicating a significant , finite logarithmic term in this regime .",
    "our qmc data thus imply a finite positive value of @xmath39 for the strip subregions within the @xmath67 antiferromagnetically ordered regime , while at @xmath52 and within the dimerized phase , our data is consistent also with the absence of a logarithmic contribution , @xmath71 .    within the antiferromagnetically",
    "ordered regime for @xmath72 , we obtain values of @xmath39 between 0.7 and 0.8 , while for @xmath33 we obtain @xmath73 , cf .",

    "in previous studies on the single square lattice heisenberg model , a corresponding value of @xmath75 was obtained for the @xmath76 strip geometry  @xcite .",
    "this value is similar to our values in the finite-@xmath8 regime @xmath72 , in accord with a possibly universal value for the @xmath61 su(2 ) symmetry breaking .",
    "however our value @xmath73 at @xmath33 falls below the value @xmath77 .",
    "such differences could be the result of finite - size effects , referring to the difficulty of estimating the logarithmic term based on the still small linear system sizes available in qmc studies .",
    "in fact , compared to ref .  ,",
    "where a finite single square lattice was considered up to @xmath78 , we effectively simulate at @xmath33 two isolated finite square lattices up to @xmath79 only .",
    "the decrease of @xmath39 seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cst ] upon increasing @xmath8 and approaching the quantum critical point suggests another manifestation of finite - size effects , since the asymptotic behavior will be accessible only for subregions that extend well beyond the correlation length scale .",
    "it is difficult to overcome these problems based on finite - system approaches , given that the correlation length scale becomes exceedingly large in this regime .",
    "figure  [ fig : cst ] also shows the value of @xmath39 that results when fitting the qmc data to the function @xmath80 .",
    "such a functional form , with @xmath71 , is expected to apply within the quantum disordered region , given ( i ) the absence of a topological entanglement entropy in this trivial gapped phase ( @xmath81 ) and ( ii ) the inclusion of the leading finite - size correction term ( @xmath82 ) , consistent with general arguments  @xcite .",
    "our data in the regime @xmath41 fits well to this formula ( with values of @xmath48 ) , returning very small values of @xmath39 that are , given the statistical uncertainty , consistent with @xmath71 .",
    "inside the antiferromagnetically ordered phase , this fitting formula returns finite values of @xmath39 that fall below the values obtained from the above fit that allowed for a finite @xmath40 term . however , inside the ordered region , a finite value of @xmath40 is expected in general due to the aspect - ratio - dependence observed in previous work on the square lattice  @xcite and its inclusion is thus required in this region .",
    "we thus also attempted to fit the strip subregion data to a function containing both a constant @xmath40 as well as the @xmath83 finite - size correction term .",
    "however , such a combined fitting ansatz results in large uncertainties on the fit parameters , since within the finite range of the accessible lattice sizes , the numerical data is not constraining sufficiently all these fit parameters , given to the finite qmc statistical uncertainties .",
    "finally , we consider logarithmic contributions to the entanglement entropy scaling that relate to the @xmath1 corners in the subregion boundary of the square subregions .",
    "one means of extracting such corner contributions would be to perform separate fits of the numerical data to the scaling formula @xmath68 for both subregion shapes , and to then compare the obtained values for @xmath39 between the two cases .",
    "however , we find that such an approach is strongly affected by the combined uncertainties in fitting the values of @xmath39 for the two subregion shapes .",
    "instead , we consider here directly the difference @xmath84 between the two entropies , cf .",
    "( [ eq : ds2 ] ) , which is shown for various values of @xmath8 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsvsl ] . for the values of @xmath41 , the data for @xmath84 shows no significant @xmath26-dependence with respect to the statistical uncertainties . for the other considered cases ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath84 is consistent within the statistical uncertainties with a linear dependence on @xmath85 , which results if the separate entropies for both subregion shapes independently follow an @xmath68 scaling with the same value of @xmath38 for both strip and square subregions , as supported by our data in fig .  [",
    "fig : avsj ] . assuming that other contributions to the logarithmic term , i.e. those from the goldstone modes are equal for both subregions ( this assumption is in accord with the formula in ref .  , and is not required if such contributions are absent , e.g. at the quantum critical point ) , we may thus extract the residual corner contribution @xmath86 by a linear regression of the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsvsl ] , i.e. by fitting to @xmath87 .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath86 are collected in table i. we find that at @xmath33 , the resulting value of @xmath88 is lower than twice the value @xmath89 obtained using a valence bond qmc approach in ref .  , while within error bars is it consistent with the ising series expansion result @xmath90 taken from the same reference .",
    "the values of @xmath86 that we extract for the finite-@xmath8 antiferromagnetically ordered region are very similar .",
    "finally , we note that the value @xmath91 that we obtain at @xmath9 implies a contribution of @xmath92 for each single @xmath1 corner at the quantum critical point .",
    "this value agrees well with the recent result obtained in ref .   from a numerical linked cluster calculation , and deviates  even when considering the qmc statistical uncertainty  with the corresponding value for a three - component gaussian theory , @xmath93 , based on the results of ref .  .",
    "the difference between these values however is not very large .",
    "this is in accord with the fact that while the true quantum critical behavior is controlled by the fisher - wilson fixed point , the two theories are connected by an @xmath94-expansion about four dimensions .",
    "we employed quantum monte carlo simulations to analyse the scaling of the entanglement entropy in the square lattice bilayer heisenberg model . for the dominant area - law term",
    ", we exhibited the enhancement of this non - universal contribution at the quantum critical point .",
    "furthermore , we find that it scales consistently with general scaling considerations in the vicinity of the quantum critical point .",
    "in addition , we examined subleading terms that contribute a logarithmic scaling with the boundary length .",
    "our numerical data is consistent with the absence of a logarithmic contribution to the entanglement entropy scaling for a subregion with a smooth boundary both at the quantum critical point and in the quantum disordered region . in the antiferromagnetically",
    "ordered region , we extracted a finite logarithmic term which can be accounted for by the presence of goldstone modes in this region .",
    "in particular , in the limit of decoupled layers , the observed increase of the logarithmic coefficient is in accord with the enhanced symmetry in this limit , which leads to a doubling of the number of goldstone modes . as in previous numerical studies ,",
    "the estimated scaling coefficients however fall below the expected values from the goldstone mode counting formula in ref .   we can not exclude that this deviation is due to finite - size corrections in the scaling coefficients , which may also be indicated by the suppression of the coefficient upon approaching the quantum critical point . to settle this issue",
    ", it will be important to calculate the goldstone - mode contribution by methods less susceptible to finite - size effects .",
    "we also estimated the subleading logarithmic contribution that is expected due to the presence of @xmath1 corners in the subregion boundary . at criticality , this contribution was conjectured to be universal in that it provides a measure of the number of components of the effective field - theory describing the quantum critical point  @xcite .",
    "our estimated value of this corner term from quantum monte carlo simulations is consistent with the recent result from a numerical linked - cluster expansion , which was performed directly in the thermodynamic limit and at zero temperature  @xcite . as the authors of ref .",
    "point out , this value is essentially three times the value that is obtained for the corner term at the quantum critical point of the two - dimensional transverse field ising model .",
    "this indeed supports the idea that this corner term provides a universal count of the degrees of freedom at the quantum critical point , analogous to the central charge in two - dimensional conformal field theory . to strengthen this conclusion",
    ", it will be important to assess the universality of this result by analyzing other two - dimensional quantum critical points of well known universality .",
    "one possible route will be the study of differently dimerized quantum spin systems or models with an @xmath95 symmetry .",
    "it may also be interesting to assess , if the value of the corner term is invariant with respect to e.g. enhanced irrelevant scaling variables , such as those proposed to emerge from three - triplon processes in the staggered - dimerized spin - model  @xcite .",
    "inside the gapped , quantum disordered regime , our numerical data is consistent with the absence of a constant term in the entanglement entropy , in accord with the absence of topological order in this model .",
    "we however did not analyse in further detail the constant contribution to the entanglement entropy beyond the quantum disordered regime .",
    "this would require to separate an inherent constant term ( e.g. at the quantum critical point ) from additional constant terms that were seen to arise in studies on torodial simulation cells due to the aspect - ratio dependence  @xcite .",

    "<S> furthermore , we consider subleading logarithmic corrections to the rnyi entanglement entropy scaling . employing different subregion shapes , we isolate the logarithmic corner term from the logarithmic contribution due to goldstone modes that is found to be enhanced in the limit of decoupled layers . at the quantum critical point </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate a contribution of @xmath0 due to each @xmath1 corner . </S>",
    "<S> this corner term at the su(2 ) quantum critical point deviates from the gaussian theory value , while it compares well with recent numerical linked cluster calculations on the bilayer model . </S>"
