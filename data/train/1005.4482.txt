    "@xcite intermediate or @xmath2 coupling schemes , in contrast to usual russel - saunders ( @xmath3 ) one , were found to be more appropriate for 5@xmath4 electrons in transuranium metals due to the presence of large spin - orbit coupling in actinides .",

    "however , temperature dependencies of er in transuranium metals show anomalously high values of er ( typically , @xmath15 ) at room temperature . for comparison , er of transition metals at the same conditions are about @xmath16 .",
    "such high resistivity values of trasuranium metals have no reasonable explanation yet and all previous model investigations substantially underestimate the experimental values of er .",
    "for example , mott two - band conductivity model combined with coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) shows , that np , pu , am , and cm are typical metals at high temperatures ,  @xcite and observed er behavior is described well in relative units .",
    "however , absolute values of er in transuranium metals can not be estimated from these calculations .",
    "indeed , the estimation of maximum value of er  taking into account only interband transitions of scattering conductivity electrons with additional accounting that probabilities are proportional to the doses values at the fermi level  gives the er values at most @xmath17 that underestimates the experimental data by a factor  of  3 .",
    "it is well known , that the high - resistivity values can be provided by specific kondo - like resonance .",
    "actinides , usually considered as heavy - fermion systems ,  @xcite should demonstrate appropriate kinetic and magnetic properties in low temperature range .",
    "however , we have no experimental data for the detailed discussion in terms of such a model .",
    "previously reported investigations of er within common kondo model@xcite have a number of problems and ambiguities@xcite due to selecting of the `` magnetic '' part of er .",
    "a principal problem arose if one uses spin - fluctuation model@xcite for describing er of @xmath6-pu and other actinides .",
    "indeed , one can find good agreement of calculated and experimental data only adjecting the stoner factor .",
    "@xcite however , such a high magnitude of the stoner factor should result in specific temperature behavior of magnetic susceptibility , typical for amplified paramagnets .",
    "in contrast to these expectations , ordinary for paramagnets temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility was measured in the systems under consideration .",

    "@xcite that demonstrates strong influence of spin - density fluctuations on electronic structure and can provide anomalies of electron heat capacity in the same temperature range , as reported in ref .  .",
    "actually , strong spin - density fluctuations effects can play a noticeable role in actinides , providing @xmath8 in very low temperature region , and suppressing superconductivity .",
    "note also , that the @xmath8 dependence and negative tcr ( observed in @xmath6-pu ) can be described in terms of strong electron - phonon coupling .",
    "@xcite thus , theoretical explanation of the high values of resistivity of transuranium metals will require significant efforts , and hence _ ab - initio _ calculations are of high interest for the understanding of ground state properties in these materials .",
    "recent experiments and electronic structure calculations revealed numerous effects due to strong correlations of the 5@xmath4 electrons in np , pu , am , and cm .",
    "@xcite a number of band methods and approximations have been applied to describe magnetic and spectral properties of transuranium metals .",
    "@xcite nonmagnetic ground state of pure plutonium metal observed experimentally@xcite was reproduced in the electronic structure calculations by the lda+@xmath0+so method .",
    "@xcite there the exchange interaction was found to be the reason of artificial antiferromagnetic ordering in previous lsda+@xmath0 investigations .",

    "@xcite however , consistent interpretation of spectroscopic data by these calculations is not found yet .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we report the results of electronic structure and resistivity calculations for transuranium metals at normal conditions and under pressure . in terms of cpa the many - band conductivity model was derived and applied for fcc - pu , am , and cm and bcc - np numerical investigations of electrical resistivity using doses of metals calculated within the lda+@xmath0+so method as a starting point .",
    "the derived model allows one to account for initial doses modifications in a direct way as a result of temperature erosion and its renormalization due to interband @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 electron transitions .",
    "the doses evolution of the metals with temperature at normal conditions and under pressure were presented and discussed .",
    "results of the er calculations are found in good agreement with available experimental data . in terms of the proposed conductivity model , using _ ab initio _ obtained parameters , the nature of high - resistivity values in actinides is also discussed .",
    "we investigated the electronic structure of transuranium metals within the lda+@xmath0+so method described in detail in ref .  .",
    "in this method the exchange interaction ( spin polarization ) term in the hamiltonian is implemented in the general nondiagonal matrix form regarding the spin variables .",

    "the screening process is defined by the charge but not spin state of the ion , then the screening contribution is canceled for exchange coulomb interaction and parameter @xmath25 does not depend on the choice of screening channels . for neptunium and plutonium , the value of hund exchange parameter @xmath25 was reported to be @xmath25  =  0.48  ev ,  @xcite for americium ",

    "( [ pot ] ) the off - diagonal exchange interaction terms with @xmath31 are significant for actinide elements . it was demonstrated in ref .",
    ", that omission of these terms can result in incorrect antiferromagnetic ground state for fcc - plutonium metal .",
    "this fact is due to the intermediate or @xmath2 coupling scheme taking place in most actinide metals , including pu , np , and cm .",
    "but in pure am metal @xmath2 coupling is present .",
    "it means that total moment @xmath32 is well defined , but not spin @xmath33 and orbital @xmath34 moments , as in usual @xmath3 coupling scheme . in this case",
    ", the basis of eigenfunctions of total moment operator @xmath35 is the best choice .",
    "the matrix of spin - orbit coupling operator is diagonal in this basis but not the exchange interaction ( spin - polarization ) term in the hamiltonian .",
    "whereas in the @xmath3 coupling scheme @xmath33 and @xmath34 operators are well defined .",
    "then the basis of @xmath3 orbitals , which are eigenfunctions of both spin @xmath33 and orbital moment @xmath34 operators , is a good choice . in this case",
    "it is possible to define quantization axis in the direction of spin moment vector so that occupation and potential matrices will be diagonal in spin variables .",
    "when the intermediate coupling is realized , neither @xmath2 basis , nor @xmath3 is valid , and occupation matrix is nondiagonal in both orbital bases and both terms in the hamiltonian : spin - orbit coupling and exchange interaction , must be taken in a general nondiagonal matrix form , and some finer treatment is necessary .",
    "intermediate basis is still cumbersome and is used for model atomic calculations .    for the actinide metals under consideration the lda+@xmath0+so densities of states ( dos )",
    "were taken as a starting point for further cpa simulations of er temperature dependencies within the model described below .",
    "in the general case , the _ many - band _ conductivity model is suitable for explanation of kinetic properties in actinides due to equal probabilities of transitions of @xmath36 electrons into almost empty @xmath29 and @xmath4 bands , since the values of doses at the fermi level in @xmath29 and @xmath4 bands are close to each other .",
    "thus , ratios between partial @xmath29 and @xmath4 doses at the fermi level lead to opening of additional channel of direct @xmath20 and back @xmath21 electrons transition .",
    "moreover , the evolution of the @xmath29 and @xmath4 doses with temperature and direct and back transitions depends on the evolution of doses of the other shell .",
    "then it is reasonable to obtain doses at finite temperatures with regular self - consistent procedure and derive corresponding cpa set of equations without model simplification , in the same way as it was made previously in ref .",
    ", when only direct @xmath18 and @xmath19 transitions were accounted for .",
    "we start considering the @xmath27(@xmath28 ) , @xmath29 , and @xmath4 electrons performing intra- and inter - band transitions as a result of their scattering at long wave phonons .",
    "we assume also that the accepting @xmath29 or @xmath4 bands are partially filled .",

    "nature of the obtained er dependencies is analogous to calculated for np and pu ones and determined mainly by renormalization of doses with temperature .    at this time nothing",
    "can be say about giant values ",
    "@xmath114  @xmath115 of er of am - iv , obtained at room temperature and ambient pressure 25 - 30 gpa .",
    "@xcite moreover , these giant values of er were measured in the system with typical metal type of conductivity without any sign of metal - semiconductor transition .",
    "all possible model s assumptions , accounting for different scattering mechanisms of conductivity of electrons and very optimistic expectations give er values about 150 - 200 @xmath116 only .",
    "the nature of high resistivity state can be explained assuming for example , that heavy electrons of @xmath29- and @xmath4-bands are the conductivity electrons and @xmath27-type electrons are excluded from charge transport process",
    ". however , we have no corresponding experimental data to point out this opinion .    * cm metal . *",
    "only recently experimental data on er in @xmath5-cm ( cm - i ) were reported .",
    "total er was found as a sum of residual resistivity ( more than 40  @xmath117 ) , magnetic part of resistivity , and the part of er originated from electron - phonon coupling .",
    "@xcite er behavior of cm is typical for antiferromagnetic metal and transparent anomalies in the vicinity of the neel point .",
    "the magnetic part of er was determined as a difference between the total resistivities of cm and am .",
    "note first , that the large value of residual resistivity shows that the investigated samples of cm metal contained a substantial number of impurities , including non - controlled ones .",
    "second , nothing can be said about reliability of the suggestion , proposed in ref .",
    ", that total er is a sum of additive values , since strong electron - impurity interaction can significantly correct this result .    in the present paper only",
    "the `` phonon '' part of the total er in cm was determined and discussed unambiguously .",
    "the calculated er is a usual linear function of temperature with positive tcr in the interval of 100  ",
    "350  k and has similar behavior as in pu and am at the higher temperature .",
    "temperature coefficient of resistivity of cm demonstrates small decreasing under pressure , the similar one was calculated for the other metals under consideration .",
    "for this reason in cm the dos value at the fermi level does not change drastically with temperature and mainly the @xmath118 factor determines the temperature behavior of er .",
    "note , that from 500 to 700  k the er of metals has weak temperature dependence and reaches its high temperature limit due to strong erosion of dos at the fermi level .",
    "we report the results of model calculations of electrical resistivity for np , pu , am , and cm metals under pressure within cpa for many - bands conductivity model .",
    "we used doses of the metals under consideration as a starting point in our model calculations . for this purpose ,",
    "np , pu , am , and cm pure metals were investigated in real crystal phases within the lda+@xmath0 method with spin - orbit coupling ( lda+@xmath0+so ) . for am and",
    "pu metals in all structures we found nonmagnetic ground state .",
    "we compared doses calculated for the real crystal structures of the transuranium metals with the doses for corresponding fcc volumes per actinide atom .",
    "it follows from this comparison that total density of states , as well as centers of gravity and bandwidth of @xmath41 = 5/2 and 7/2 subbands are in good agreement .",
    "it means that the cubic structures in different volumes provide good estimation for the doses of real crystal structures .",
    "results of our cpa calculations within derived many - band conductivity model for _ pure _ fcc - pu , am , and cm and bcc - np using bloch constant value @xmath119@xcite and _ ab  initio _ doses of metals show ordinary metal type of er behavior vs. temperature at normal conditions and under pressure .",
    "high values of er in these metals are a consequence of @xmath18 and @xmath120 transitions of scattering electrons and effective mass of conductivity electrons increasing as a result of @xmath27- and @xmath29-electron bands hybridization .",
    "weak non - linearity in the er temperature behavior of metals above @xmath83 is caused by dos erosion at the fermi level due to electron - phonon interaction .",
    "the obtained high - resistivity values in actinides result from @xmath18 and @xmath19 interband transitions and conductivity electron mass renormalization due to strong @xmath27-@xmath29 hybridization . also strong influence on the er temperature dependencies of actinides",
    "is a result of dos of accepting bands modifications as products of direct @xmath18 and @xmath20 and back @xmath21 electrons transitions . calculated",
