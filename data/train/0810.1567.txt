    "heavy quarkona play important roles in the study of quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) in high energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "lattice studies of charmonium spectral functions at finite temperatures have suggested that hadronic excitations corresponding to @xmath0 may survive in the deconfinement phase till relatively high temperatures @xcite . in order to understand discrepancy with the experimental observation of @xmath0 suppression ,",
    "a sequential @xmath0 suppression scenario has been proposed @xcite , in which a part of @xmath0 particles in heavy ion collisions are produced through @xmath1 and @xmath2 s and thus dissociation of @xmath1 and @xmath2 s states lead to additional contributions to the @xmath0 suppression .    to examine the scenario ,",
    "several groups started to study spectral functions for @xmath2 states on the lattice adopting a bayesian method @xcite .",
    "they found that the low energy part of the spectral functions for @xmath4 and @xmath5 states drastically increase just above @xmath6 , suggesting dissociation of these states immediately above @xmath6 . on the other hand ,",
    "one of the present authors has recently pointed out that such change is caused by a constant mode expected in high temperature meson correlation functions on the lattice @xcite . to obtain physically meaningful results from meson correlation functions in the deconfining phase , we have to separate the effects of the constant mode .    in this paper",
    ", we carry out a study of charmonium states above @xmath6 in quenched qcd on anisotropic lattices , subtracting the contribution of the constant mode .",
    "we combine all the known rigid techniques to investigate meson states at high temperature . in order to extract a few lowest energy states in euclidean correlators we adopt the variational method @xcite , in which the eigenvalues @xmath7 of the correlation matrix provide the energies of the states . @xmath8",
    "the @xmath9 correlation matrix is defined by @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 for vector(v ) and axial - vector(av ) channels , respectively . in this study",
    "we use operators with gaussian smearing function @xmath13 with @xmath14 different values of the width parameter @xmath15 .",
    "the analysis enables us to study excited states such as @xmath16 , which is the radial excitation state of charmonium with @xmath17 channel .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , to study meson - like states in the high temperature phase , we have to subtract the effects of the constant mode from the meson correlators , because it sometimes makes it difficult to extract low energy states , in particular for p - waves .",
    "we adopt the midpoint subtraction method @xcite to remove the constant mode .    to distinguish bound states of @xmath18-@xmath19 quarks from their scattering states in lattice",
    "qcd , we study the spatial boundary condition dependence of the energy spectrum at finite volume@xcite : the energy of scattering states depends on its relative momentum which is quantized according to the volume size and boundary conditions . on the other hand",
    "the spectrum of the bound states does not change against such exchange of boundary conditions .",
    "therefore , we can judge the existence of scattering states from a shift in the energy spectrum . in this study , we prepare three types of spatial boundary condition , pbc , apbc and mbc , where ( a)pbc is the ( anti-)periodic boundary condition in all spatial directions , and mbc is anti - periodic in x - direction and periodic in the others directions .",
    "we also study the bethe - salpeter wave function from the spatial correlation function between @xmath18-@xmath19 quarks @xcite .",
    "we expect that wave functions for binding state will be compact , while those for scattering state will be extended and will change its shape depending on the lattice volume .",
    "the gauge configurations have been generated by an standard plaquette gauge action with a lattice gauge coupling constant , @xmath20 and a bare anisotropy parameter @xmath21 .",
    "the definition of the action and parameters are the same as that adopted in ref .",
    "the lattice spacings are @xmath22 gev and @xmath23 gev .",
    "our simulations are performed on @xmath24 lattices with @xmath25 and @xmath26 to study temperature and volume dependence respectively .",
    "temperatures are given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 in our setup .",
    "for the quark fields , we adopt an @xmath29-improved wilson quark action with tadpole improved tree level clover coefficients .",
    "although the definition of the quark action is the same as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we adopt a different choice of the wilson parameter @xmath30 to suppress lattice artifact in higher excited states .",
    "figure [ fig : mass ] shows the temperature dependence of charmonium energies in vector and axial - vector channels .",
    "these energies are calculated by the variational method with @xmath31 correlation matrix . at @xmath32",
    "the lowest and next - lowest states in the vector channel are @xmath0 and @xmath16 states respectively .",
    "the lowest state in the axial - vector channel is the @xmath5 state at @xmath32 .",
    "results adopting different boundary conditions are shown by different colors .    from a study of meson - like correlators in the free quark case as a model of scattering states , we find that the largest shift of the ground state energy appears between pbc and apbc for the s - wave , while for p - wave states between pbc and mbc .",
    "therefore , we compare pbc and apbc(mbc ) for s-(p-)waves . as a reference ,",
    "energy shifts in the lowest states are about 200mev for the case of free quarks in a @xmath33 box .",
    "although statistical errors in axial - vector channels are not quite small yet , fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] shows that typical mass shifts are much smaller than those expected in the free quark case up to about @xmath3 .",
    "figure [ fig : wf ] shows the volume dependence of charmonium wave functions in vector and axial - vector channels at @xmath34 .",
    "the bethe - salpeter wave function is defined by @xmath35 here the axial - vector channel is calculated with a derivative operator @xmath36 in order to construct the wave function with large component .",
    "the @xmath37 is @xmath38-th energy state which can be extracted by using the eigen functions , @xmath39 , in eq .",
    "( [ eq001 ] ) , @xmath40 . left and right panels show charmonium with vector and axial - vector channels respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=207 ]",
    "in order to study the charmonium dissociation at @xmath41 , we extract ground and the first excited charmonium states in s- and p - waves and study boundary condition dependence of their energy , as well as the volume - dependence of their wave functions . from a simulation of quenched anisotropic lattice qcd , we found so far no sign of scattering states up to about @xmath3 .",
    "the simulations have been performed on supercomputers ( nec sx-5 ) at the research center for nuclear physics ( rcnp ) at osaka university . this work is also supported by the large scale simulation program no.07 - 18(fy2008 ) of high energy accelerator research organization ( kek ) and the nos.17340066 and nos.19549001 with grants - in - aid of the japanese mext .",
