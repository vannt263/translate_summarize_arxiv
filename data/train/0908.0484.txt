    "understanding the kinetics ( homeostasis ) of cells in adult mammalian tissues has long been a major challenge in biology .",
    "recent progress in experimental methods made it feasible to label individual cells _ in vivo _ , and follow their fate and that of their progeny @xcite . this powerful genetic labeling technique has enabled _ in vivo _ experiments in the outmost layer of skin ( epidermis ) of the tail in adult mice @xcite .",
    "individual cells in the basal layer of the epidermis have been marked by a fluorescent genetic label and the size of the clone ( all living progenies of a cell ) of each single marked cell has been measured at different times .",
    "this has provided the data on the evolution of the clone size distribution in the basal layer of the epidermis .",
    "the prevailing model of epidermal homeostasis has involved long - lived stem cells generating short - lived populations of transit - amplifying ( ta ) cells that differentiate into post - mitotic cells @xcite .",
    "the stem - ta hypothesis predicts that the clones of ta cells should disappear ( after sufficiently long time ) , while the existing clones should be small and associated with stem cells .",
    "strikingly , the fraction of remaining clones was found to decrease as @xmath0 ; accordingly the average size of existing clones scales linearly with time .",
    "this remarkable scaling behavior calls for a totally different model of epidermal homeostasis .",
    "@xcite proposed a model of cell division and differentiation which manifestly obeys the observed scaling behavior and provides an excellent fit to more subtle characteristics .",
    "a gratifying property of the model suggested by @xcite is that it is _ simpler _ than the stem - ta model : the new model involves only a single type of committed progenitor cell , and in particular , stem - cell proliferation is not required for epidermal homeostasis .",
    "thus the model describes the population of cells of two types : proliferating cells ( type @xmath1 ) divide and eventually differentiate into non - proliferiting cells ( type @xmath2 ) , which leave the basal layer and migrate to the epidermal surface where they are shed .",
    "more precisely , the cell population evolves according to the continuous time , constant rate , two - type branching process @xmath3 here we set the overall cell division rate to unity . in the experiments of @xcite , the division rate was equal to @xmath4week ; the values of the parameters were found to be @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "note that the model is assumed to be critical , that is the division rates corresponding to the channels @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the same . due to this symmetry ,",
    "the average population size of progenitor cells remains constant as it is required by the steady - state assumption .",
    "the average population size of the post - mitotic cells is also constant .",
    "so far the model has been experimentally tested only in mice tail skin .",
    "there are still technical constraints preventing the quantitative tests of the model in other tissues , but those problems are temporary .",
    "the model challenges the necessity of stem - cell proliferation for the homeostasis of epidermis @xcite .",
    "there is also growing evidence @xcite that stem cells do not contribute to the maintenance of various other adult tissues .",
    "hence the two - type branching process may find a broad range of applications and therefore it is highly desirable to possess an exact solution . despite its apparent simplicity ,",
    "the branching process has not been solved , although some exact and asymptotic behaviors have been found @xcite . in this paper",
    "we apply generating function techniques to obtain an exact analytic solution , as well as approximate methods to derive asymptotic limits .",
    "branching processes have been extensively used to model proliferation of differentiating cells , especially in the hemopoietic ( blood production ) system @xcite ; see also other references in section 6.9.1 in @xcite .",
    "an interesting multi - type model has also been proposed recently in @xcite .",
    "these studies , however , mainly rely on numerical solutions , while analytic treatment is restricted to obtaining average quantities ( or second moments ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce the model in section  [ model ] , and discuss its basic behavior . after presenting the generating function methods in section  [ generate ]",
    ", we provide an elementary solution on a special line in the parameter space in section  [ elementary ] .",
    "the model admits a neat explicit solution at the special point @xmath9 , which is discussed in section  [ special ] . as our main result",
    ", we derive the generating function of the model for general parameter values in section  [ general ] , where we also present an efficient numerical method to obtain the probabilities of having certain number of cells at a given time .",
    "we discuss the large time asymptotic behavior in section  [ scaling ] , and derive additional scaling properties by means of the fokker - plank method in section  [ diffuz ] .",
    "final remarks are presented in section  [ disco ] .",
    "the model involves two types of cells , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "type @xmath1 cells ( progenitor cells ) are able to divide ( proliferate ) and diffirentiate , @xmath2 cells ( post - mitotic cells ) do not divide , they just die ( leave the basal layer ) .",
    "more precisely , the two cell populations evolve according to the two - type branching process .",
    "the probability @xmath10 of having @xmath11 copies of @xmath1 , and @xmath12 copies of @xmath2 at time @xmath13 satisfies @xmath14 the consecutive gain terms on the right - hand side of eq .   merely describe the contributions of the channels ( from top to bottom ) of the two - type branching process . to determine the clone size distribution",
    "we start with a single @xmath1 cell , that is @xmath15 we are interested in the full distribution @xmath10 and also in the reduced probability distribution @xmath16 of having @xmath17 total cells at time @xmath13 ; the latter distribution is directly probed in experiments .",
    "needless to say , @xmath18    let us first determine the probability distribution @xmath19 of having @xmath11 cells of type @xmath1 .",
    "this probability distribution is readily found since @xmath2 cells do not affect @xmath1 cells , and @xmath1 cells alone evolve according to the critical branching process @xmath20 the solution , for the initial condition @xmath21 , is @xcite @xmath22 notice that the average number of @xmath1 cells remains constant , @xmath23 throughout the evolution .",
    "this is of course a general property of the critical branching process .",
    "we can also compute the average number of post - mitotic cells @xmath24 .",
    "indeed , this quantity satisfies a simple rate equation @xmath25 the gain term on the right - hand side of follows from the second and third channels ( from top to bottom ) of the two - type branching process ; the loss term corresponds to the last channel . using @xmath26 and @xmath27 we solve to yield @xmath28 therefore the total average number of cells is given by @xmath29 note that the fraction of type @xmath1 cells is asymptotically @xmath30    these exact expressions for the average population sizes are useful and e.g.  the fraction of type @xmath1 cells will appear in numerous latter formulae .",
    "the full description of the clone size requires analyzing an infinite set of master equations .",
    "we shall perform such analysis using generating function techniques .",
    "we define the generating function of @xmath10 as @xmath31 note that is valid for all @xmath32 , if we define @xmath33 for all @xmath34 or @xmath35 .",

    "thus we need to solve the partial differential equation subject to .",
    "mathematically , equation is a hyperbolic partial differential equation and it can be analyzed using the method of characteristics @xcite .",
    "instead , we employ backward kolmogorov equations ; this approach is technically somewhat easier in the present case .",
    "here we need two generating functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where the subscripts refer to the type of the single initial cell . for the forward case we only needed the interesting @xmath43 .",
    "the initial conditions are @xmath44 the coupled backward kolmogorov equations read    @xmath45    these equations can be derived from the corresponding backward kolmogorov equations for the probabilities @xmath10 , or they can be written down directly @xcite .",
    "the negative terms ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) describe the disappearance of a cell , and the positive terms stand for the created new cells , with the corresponding rates .",
    "the term  1 \" in is just the generating function of no created particle , that is @xmath48 .",
    "equation is immediately solved to give @xmath49 this is not surprising , of course : starting with a single @xmath2 cell , the system will either contain the initial @xmath2 cell ( this occurs with probability @xmath50 ) or no cells at all . substituting into and changing the variable from @xmath13 to @xmath51 we obtain @xmath52 where we dropped the subscript @xmath1 so that @xmath43 .",
    "we further simplify the above equation by changing variable @xmath51 to @xmath53 .",
    "the function @xmath54 then satisfies @xmath55 with initial condition @xmath56 . in equation and",
    "later the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath57 .",
    "note that the forward equation leads to the same equation via the method of characteristics .",
    "equation is an ordinary differential equation of the first order .",
    "yet it is non - linear and could be unsolvable as it belongs to the family of riccati equations .",
    "riccati equations are in principle intractable , yet there are two tricks which sometimes allow to solve certain riccati equations @xcite .",
    "one is based on the reduction to the _ linear _ ordinary differential equation of the second order , the sturm - liouville equation .",
    "another trick applies if we manage to find a special solution .",
    "we shall see that both tricks lead to success .",
    "let us begin with the more elementary second approach .",
    "the idea is to guess one solution @xmath58 irrespective whether it satisfies the initial condition or not .",
    "having found such a special solution , one then seeks a general solution in the form @xmath59 the function @xmath60 satisfies a _ linear _ differential equation which is readily solvable .",

    "this mapping holds if also initially we have an @xmath1 or a @xmath2 cell equiprobably . if the initial cell is type @xmath1 , then from the solution for a single initial @xmath2 cell , and from the solution of , we recover the behavior  due to the linearity of the problem .",
    "in section [ elementary ] we have found an explicit , exact expression for the generating function , equation , which is valid on the curve .",
    "this curve misses the parameter values ( @xmath95 ) experimentally measured in mice tail epidermis @xcite , see figure  [ r - gamma ] . in different tissues",
    "the parameters will probably take different values , so it is desirable to possess a solution in the whole range of parameters , i.e. in the strip @xmath127 and @xmath89 .",

    "the above integral can be approximated as a sum @xmath169 which is the discrete fourier transform scaled by @xmath170 .",
    "this transformation can be performed incredibly efficiently by the fast fourier transform ( fft ) method , which is implemented in most mathematical software .",
    "this method is discussed and error terms are approximated in @xcite .",
    "some care is needed to choose the value of @xmath167 to avoid numerical problems , as discussed in @xcite . in our case",
    "the choice @xmath171 was sufficient in all examples we considered .",
    "we can check the quality of this numerical method at the special point @xmath9 , where the explicit solution for @xmath10 is known .",
    "for example at @xmath172 , with @xmath173 the numerical result for @xmath16 differs less than @xmath174 from the exact expression for @xmath175 , and it is precise to at least ten digits for @xmath176 .    for the full distribution @xmath10 one needs two separate contour integrals in both the @xmath97 and the @xmath98 planes , which then leads to applying the discrete fourier transform @xmath177 times . we have checked the results against the numerical solution of the forward equations and found a perfect agreement ( up to about 7 digits ) .",
    "this method has been used to obtain our figures [ sumscale ] and [ fig : fullscale ] for @xmath16 and @xmath10 , respectively . in @xcite the initial cell is considered to be @xmath1 or @xmath2 with certain probabilities .",
    "the corresponding probability distribution is then a simple linear combination of the distribution @xmath10 we just obtained and the trivial distribution resulting from a single initial @xmath2 cell . since @xmath2 cells just die at a fixed rate , their only effect (",
    "apart from @xmath178 and @xmath179 ) is to rescale @xmath10 .",
    "thus we have obtained exact results  for the generating function , which can be easily transformed back to probabilities .",
    "moreover , these exact results simplify in a few special cases ( appendix [ spec_case ] ) and in the scaling limit ( section [ scaling ] ) .",
    "in the large time limit , the distributions @xmath162 and @xmath16 simplify .",
    "let us consider first the reduced distribution @xmath164",
    ". in the large time limit the interesting range of @xmath180 is @xmath181 , see e.g.  , and therefore the interesting range of @xmath114 is @xmath182 .",
    "hence we consider the @xmath183 limit with @xmath184 kept constant , where @xmath185 , see .    in order to perform the scaling limit",
    "we need the following small argument ( @xmath186 ) limits of the whittaker functions @xmath187 here @xmath188 is the gamma function , @xmath189 is the digamma function , and @xmath190 is the euler constant @xcite .",

    "the probability @xmath10 for @xmath220 in the scaling limit becomes @xmath221 \\delta\\left ( \\frac{m-\\gamma n}{t } \\right)\\ ] ] hence in this limit there are precisely @xmath222 times as many @xmath1 cells as @xmath2 cells , while the distribution of the cells is given by .",
    "according to the experiments of @xcite in skin tissue , where @xmath223 , the model predicts about four times more post mitotic cells than progenitor cells in a clone for large times .",
    "it is possible to give a more detailed description of the cell distribution by taking a different large time limit , namely we need to take the limit @xmath224 in such a way that the following fractions are finite @xmath225 this limit reveals the  shape \" of the dirac delta in .",
    "this asymptotic limit is of course encoded in the exact results for the generating function .",
    "unfortunately , to extract the asymptotic is far from straightforward . indeed , even from a simple expression for the multivariate generating function , it is usually extremely difficult to extract the asymptotic of the coefficients ( let alone the exact expressions for the coefficients ) .",
    "this situation is perhaps surprising as in the univariate case there are various techniques , the most powerful is the use of complex analysis and the saddle point method . in the multivariate case ,",
    "the usage of complex methods is much more limited and challenging ; for recent progress , see @xcite and @xcite . in our case , there is an additional difficulty as the explicit expression for the generating function is not a simple rational function as e.g.  in most examples in @xcite , but it involves the whittaker functions .",
    "hence instead of extracting the scaling limit from the exact solution , we outline another approach in the next section that also shows an independent way of handling the problem .     of having @xmath11 type @xmath1 , and @xmath12 type @xmath2 cells at time @xmath13 , as given by .",

    "the complication is that cancer typically involves multiple mutations @xcite , so the quantitative description may require a multiple - type branching process .",
