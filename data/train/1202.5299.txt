    "observational data are often very complex , appearing without any structure or pattern in either time or space . examples of such observations can be found across the whole spectrum of the social and natural sciences , ranging from economics @xcite , to physics @xcite , biology @xcite , and medicine @xcite .",
    "the origins of observed irregular behavior , however , are not always clear .",
    "roughly five decades ago , deterministic chaos was discovered @xcite and quickly rose to prominence as a possible mechanism of inherent unpredictability and complexity @xcite . yet",
    "the strict criteria for declaring deterministic chaos in observed data @xcite , most notably the satisfaction of criteria for stationarity and determinism @xcite , and the verification of exponential divergence @xcite , are rarely satisfied . in response , attention has begun to shift from chaos to noise and random processes as alternate @xcite ( or , in many cases , as even more probable ) sources of irregularity .",
    "while the theory of deterministic chaos relies on nonlinear dynamical systems with typically only a few degrees of freedom , the analysis of stochastic processes , especially those that yield data with scale invariance , relies on random fractal theory @xcite or its generalization , multifractal theory @xcite .",
    "indeed , investigations based on these theoretical foundations may provide an elegant statistical characterization of a broad range of heterogeneous phenomena @xcite , and in this paper , it is our goal to extend this theory to culturomics , as recently introduced in @xcite .",
    "culturomics , and the study of human culture in general , seemingly has little to do with deterministic chaos and fractals .",
    "however , quantitative analyses of various aspects of human culture have become increasingly popular ; examples include the study of human mobility patterns @xcite , the spread of infectious diseases @xcite and malware @xcite , the dynamics of online popularity @xcite , social movement @xcite and language @xcite , and even tennis @xcite .",
    "this progress is driven not only by important advances in theory and modeling , but also by the increasing availability of vast amounts of data and knowledge , also referred to as metaknowledge @xcite , which allows scientists to apply advanced methods of analysis on a large scale @xcite .",
    "the seminal study by @xcite was accompanied by the release of a vast amount of data comprised of metrics derived from @xmath0 of books ever published ( over five million in total ) , and it was this release that made the present study , _",
    "i.e. _ the application of random fractal theory , possible .",
    "the data are available at ngrams.googlelabs.com as counts of @xmath1-grams that appeared in a given corpus of books published in each year .",
    "an @xmath1-gram is made up of a series of @xmath1 @xmath2-grams , and a @xmath2-gram is a string of characters uninterrupted by a space .",
    "note that a @xmath2-gram is not necessarily a word , for it may be a number or a typo as well . besides the counts of individual @xmath1-grams , the total counts of @xmath1-grams contained in each corpus of books in a given year are also provided , from which yearly usage frequencies can be obtained .    in this paper",
    ", we show what new insights are attainable by applying random fractal theory to this vast culturomic data set .",
    "our goal is to try and go beyond the interpretations of trajectories provided in @xcite by means of an accurate determination of scaling parameters @xcite , and in particular the hurst parameter @xmath3 , which enables us to characterize the nature of correlations ( memory ) , if any , contained in the irregular time series . in general , data with long - range correlations are an important subclass of @xmath4 noise @xcite , which is characterized by a power - law decaying power spectral density , and whose dimensionality can not be reduced by principal component analysis since the rank - ordered eigenvalue spectrum also decays as a power law @xcite .",
    "processes that generate time series with such properties are said to have antipersistent correlations if @xmath5 , are memoryless or have only short - range correlations if @xmath6 , and have persistent long - range correlations ( long memory ) if @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "moreover , values of @xmath8 are possible as well ; these values , however , are characteristic of nonstationary processes or rather special stationary processes such as on - off intermittency with power - law distributed on and/or off periods and lvy walks @xcite .",
    "( note that the latter should not be confused with lvy flights , which are random processes consisting of many independent steps , and are thus memoryless with @xmath6 . )",
    "prominent examples where @xmath4 noise was recently observed and quantified include dna sequences @xcite , human cognition @xcite and coordination @xcite , posture @xcite , cardiac dynamics @xcite , as well as the distribution of prime numbers @xcite , to name but a few .    despite the many successful attempts at assessing long - range correlations in complex time series  for example , by means of detrended fluctuation analysis @xcite , as well as many other methods @xcite",
    " care should be exercised by their interpretation , particularly if one is faced with relatively short time series that contain trends @xcite , nonstationarity @xcite , or signs of rhythmic activity @xcite .",
    "although it is obviously impossible to make general statements concerning these properties for all the @xmath1-grams contained in the corpus of the over five million digitized books , which amount roughly to over two billion culturomic trajectories , it is clear that the time series are short , comprising a little more than @xmath9 points corresponding to the two centuries considered ( more precisely , from year 1770 to 2007 ) , and that many will inevitably contain strong trends @xcite . in order to successfully surpass the difficulties and pitfalls associated with the analysis of such time series @xcite , besides the traditional detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa )",
    ", we also use an adaptive fractal analysis ( afa ) , which is based on nonlinear adaptive multiscale decomposition .",
    "we use these methods to determine the hurst parameter @xmath3 for several @xmath2-grams that are representative for social and natural phenomena .",
    "examples of words that we focus on include war , unemployment , hurricane and earthquake ( see tables  1 and 2 for the complete list ) , and we find that those that describe social phenomena ( war , unemployment , etc . ) in general have different scaling properties than those describing natural phenomena ( hurricane , earthquake , etc . ) .",
    "our results can be corroborated aptly with arguments from real life , and they fit nicely to the declared goal of culturomics , which is to extend the boundaries of scientific inquiry to a wide array of new phenomena @xcite .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present the main results , in section 3 we summarize them and discuss their potential implications , while in the appendix we describe the details of fractal analysis .",

    "d ) best fit to the @xmath11 versus @xmath12 dependence for original data on a double log scale yields @xmath14.,width=306 ]    we start by presenting the results of the adaptive fractal analysis for natural phenomena . in figure",
    "[ earthquake ] , we first plot in panel ( a ) the original time series ( thin blue line ) and the estimated trend ( thick red line ) for the 1-gram `` earthquake '' . the detrended data are presented in panel ( b ) .",
    "it can be observed that overall the trend is very modest and simple , increasing only slightly towards the present day .",
    "using equation  [ ada ] , the hurst parameter can be estimated from the slope of the @xmath11 versus @xmath12 dependence on a double log scale . in panel",
    "( c ) , we show that the analysis of detrended data yields @xmath13 , while in panel ( d ) , we show that @xmath14 if the original data is used as input .",
    "both calculations produce similar results , showing a very modest slope , and rely on statistically robust scaling . based on the meaning of the hurst parameter",
    ", the fractal analysis of the culturomic trajectory for `` earthquake '' reveals that this phenomenon has persistent long - range correlation .    .",
    "a ) the variation of the usage frequency of `` hurricane '' with time .",
    "the blue ( thin ) line depicts the original data , while the red ( thick ) line depicts the estimated trend ( using a window of length @xmath10 ) .",
    "b ) detrended data , _ i.e. _ the difference between the blue and red curves in panel a ) .",
    "c ) best fit to the @xmath11 versus @xmath12 dependence for detrended data on a double log scale yields @xmath15 .",
    "d ) best fit to the @xmath11 versus @xmath12 dependence for original data on a double log scale yields @xmath16.,width=306 ]    as another example , we show in figure  [ hurricane ] the same analysis for the 1-gram `` hurricane '' . unlike the `` earthquake '' trajectory , the trend for `` hurricane '' is more pronounced .",
    "it has a strong upwards component , especially in the last couple of decades .",
    "hence , it can be expected that the discrepancy of the two estimated @xmath3 values for the original and detrended data will be somewhat larger than that for the 1-gram `` earthquake '' analyzed in figure  [ earthquake ] .",
    "this expectation is indeed confirmed by comparing panels ( c ) and ( d ) , from where it follows that for the detrended data @xmath15 while for original data @xmath16 .",
    "still , however , both results robustly classify `` hurricane '' as a phenomenon with persistent long - range correlations , thus adding to the evidence that this may be valid in general for natural phenomena .    to test this hypothesis",
    "more thoroughly , we have performed the same analysis as depicted in figures  [ earthquake ] and [ hurricane ] , along with the detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) , for thirteen other phenomena that can be classified as characteristic of natural phenomena .",
    "although there may be some disagreement as to what terms are _ characteristic _ of natural phenomenon , and other 1-grams as well as @xmath1-grams could be suggested as characteristic of natural phenomena and analyzed , we consider our selection to be sufficiently representative for this study",
    ". supporting this assumption are the results presented in table  [ natural ] , which point robustly towards the conclusion that natural phenomena in general really can be classified as processes with persistent long - range correlations . more specifically , for detrended data",
    ", we find that all estimated hurst parameters are within the @xmath7 range with an average of @xmath17 ( afa ) , which leads us to the mentioned final conclusion .",
    "results obtained for original data ( before detrending , not shown ) , on the other hand , leave a bit more room for discussion . there , for certain 1-grams , like `` mudslide '' and `` flooding '' , the value of @xmath3 is larger than one .",
    "this suggests that the data would be more appropriately described as being either nonstationary , on - off intermittent , or lvy walk - like .",
    "such a discussion , however , would be to a large degree baseless as the upward trends occurring towards the present time in most @xmath1-grams describing natural phenomena must be properly taken into account .",
    "the observed trends may be considered as a straightforward consequence of the fact that we have more and more data readily available on natural phenomena , which is due to advancements in measuring techniques as well as the increasingly global reach of the internet .",
    "modern data collection and telecommunication technologies have raised our awareness , in general , of natural phenomena , and as a result , it is reasonable to expect this increased awareness to be reflected in an increase of occurrences in the corpus .",
    "note , however , that similar arguments can be raised for other fields and trivia ( _ e.g. _ celebrity gossip , popular culture ) as well , and thus one could argue that relatively , the usage frequencies should not necessarily increase as a result of that .",

    "first , we presented the adaptive fractal analysis for the 1-gram `` war '' in figure  [ war ] .",
    "the original data depicted by the thin blue line in panel ( a ) are clearly reminiscent of historical events , as world wars i & ii generate two large peaks that more or less dwarf the usage frequencies reported in other decades .",
    "this observation goes hand in hand not just with the magnitude of the two world wars , but also with the increase in the usage frequency of `` war '' in the published literature at that time . in agreement with the historical events",
    "is the estimated trend line depicted by the thick red line in panel ( a ) .",
    "however , even after the detrending , the resulting culturomic trajectory still clearly reflects history in that the periods of world wars i & ii stand out from the rest , as can be inferred from the curve depicted in panel ( b ) .",
    "the hurst parameter @xmath3 determined using the detrended and original data [ presented in panels ( c ) and ( d ) ] have similar values to each other ( @xmath19 for the detrended data and @xmath20 for the original data ) .",
    "as a result , both classify `` war '' as either a nonstationary , on - off intermittent , or a lvy walk - like process .    .",

    "d ) best fit to the @xmath11 versus @xmath12 dependence for original data on a double log scale yields @xmath22.,width=306 ]    another illustrative example of fractal analysis is presented in figure  [ unemployment ] , where we examine the 1-gram `` unemployment '' . a crucial distinction from `` war '' , as well as all the considered natural phenomena , is that unemployment was nonexistent , or at least it was not mentioned , in the literature prior to 1900 , which is clearly inferable from the original data depicted thin blue in panel ( a ) . with the coming of age of the industrial revolution , the job market began to take shape , and with it came , rather inevitably it seems , the problem of unemployment .",
    "the trend line depicted thick red in panel ( a ) clearly captures this fact .",
    "moreover , we note that the first broad peak in the plot starts at around @xmath23 , and thus correlates well with the great depression , while the second broad peak starts at around @xmath24 , and thus correlates with that period of us economic stagnation and high inflation that was linked with the middle eastern oil crisis .",
    "after detrending , the situation is of course only marginally improved ( in terms of assuring a more stationary record ) , as can be concluded from the curve depicted in panel ( b ) .",

    "the results are presented in table  [ social ] .",
    "it can be observed that the large majority of considered 1-grams have @xmath8 ( afa ) , which indicates that social phenomena are most likely to be either nonstationary , on - off intermittent , or lvy walk - like process .",
    "this conclusion is obtained irrespective of whether detrending is performed or not , although the average hurst parameter for detrended data , equalling @xmath25 ( afa ) , is smaller than that obtained for original data ( before detrending , not shown ) , which is @xmath26 .",
    "this technical discrepancy , however , is likely due to the successful removal of some level of nonstationarity that is in general characteristic of social phenomena ( more so than of natural phenomena ) .",
    "we would like to note , however , that in general not all @xmath8 occurrences should be , by default , attributed to nonstationarity in the trajectories . while visual inspection may lend support to such a conclusion , as this was the case for results presented in figure  [ unemployment ] , in general the @xmath3 value alone can not distinguish between nonstationary , on - off intermittent or lvy walk - like processes",
    "in fact , the time series are too short for a robust assessment of a more precise nature of the examined social phenomena . at a glance , and since this is indeed most common , it seems convenient to attribute @xmath8 in social phenomena to nonstationarity , yet only additional future data can enable us to differentiate whether the peaks are part of an on - off intermittent process with power law distributed on and/or off events , or if they are part of a lvy walk .",
    "lastly , we would also like to point out that of course not _ all _ phenomena that can be considered as social will have @xmath8 .",
    "examples include 1-grams such as `` famine '' or `` christian '' , which for the largest parts of the recorded human history were either directly related to natural phenomena ( severe droughts , flooding , or other phenomena negatively affected that season s yield on vegetables , crops , grass , and animal population , hence leading to famine ) or have been an integral part of the human culture for a long time ( prior to the start of the culturomic trajectories ) .",
    "moreover , social topics that are of little interest will not garner much attention , and are as such also unlikely to have usage frequencies with @xmath8 .",
    "the social phenomena where the human factor has played a key role recently and which are reasonably popular , however , all share features that are characteristic of processes with @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , it seems just to conclude that the more the social phenomena can be considered recent ( unemployment , recession , democracy ) , the higher their hurst parameter is likely to be ( see table  [ social ] ) .",
    "this agrees nicely also with the recent observation of bursts and heavy tails in human dynamics @xcite .",
    "by applying fractal analysis based on dfa and afa to culturomic trajectories of 1-grams describing typical social and natural phenomena over the past two centuries , we have found that they obey different scaling laws . as we will discuss in what follows ,",
    "our findings agree nicely with existing theory and expectations , as well as offer new interpretations as to what might be the main driving forces behind the examined phenomena .",
    "we find that natural phenomena have properties that are typical of processes that generate persistent long - range correlations , as evidenced by the hurst parameter being in the range @xmath27 , with an average over all fifteen considered 1-grams equalling @xmath17 ( afa ) .",
    "the prevalence of long - term memory in natural phenomena compels us to conjecture that the long - range correlations in the usage frequency of the corresponding terms is predominantly driven by occurrences in nature of those phenomena . using data from five million digitized books to arrive at this understanding",
    "certainly supports the declared goal of culturomics and lends strong support to its core principles .",
    "owing to this memory , and of course by using statistical data available , we know , based on the gutenberg - richter law @xcite , that in the united kingdom , for example , an earthquake of @xmath28 on the richter scale is likely to happen every year , an earthquake of @xmath29 is due approximately every 10 years , while an earthquake of 5.6 or larger is bound to happen every 100 years @xcite .",
    "similar `` statistical predictions '' are available for tsunamis and many other , if not all , natural phenomena . on a more personal level",
    ", this also agrees with how we naturally develop an understanding for the weather and related natural phenomena for the region we live in .    social phenomena , on the other hand , have the hurst parameter in the range @xmath30 , with an average over all fifteen considered 1-grams equalling @xmath25 ( afa ) .",
    "this is indicative of nonstationary processes , or stationary processes like on - off intermittency with power - law distributed on and/or off periods or lvy walks .",
    "while our analysis does not allow distinction between these three options , it is clear that all these processes are fundamentally different from those describing natural phenomena .",
    "so while it is common to hear speculations about possible average periods regarding social phenomena  for instance , that there may be an average period between major wars or stock market crashes  our analysis suggests this is not the case , and that social phenomena tend to follow different scaling laws than natural phenomena .",
    "such a difference is not unexpected , as social phenomena are , by nature , more complex than natural phenomena ; the former depend on political , economic , and social forces , as well as on natural phenomena .",
    "the results of this additional complexity can be seen in our fractal analysis of a set of culturomic trajectories .    in summary",
    ", we hope to have successfully demonstrated that the data made available through the culturomics project @xcite , when coupled with advanced methods of analysis , offer fascinating opportunities to explore human culture in the broadest possible sense .",
    "nonlinear adaptive multiscale decomposition starts by partitioning a time series into segments of length @xmath31 , where neighboring segments overlap by @xmath32 points , thus introducing a time scale of @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the sampling time .",
    "each segment is then fitted with the best polynomial of order @xmath35 .",
    "note that @xmath36 and 1 correspond to piece - wise constant and linear fitting , respectively .",
    "we denote the fitted polynomials for the @xmath37-th and @xmath38-th segments by @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively , where @xmath41 .",
    "we then define the fitting for the overlapped region as @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 can be written as @xmath45 for @xmath46 , and where @xmath47 denotes the distances between the point and the centers of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "this means that the weights decrease linearly with the distance between the point and the center of the segment .",
    "such a weighting ensures symmetry and effectively eliminates any jumps or discontinuities around the boundaries of neighboring segments .",
    "in fact , the scheme ensures that the fitting is continuous everywhere , is smooth at the non - boundary points , and has the right- and left - derivatives at the boundary .",
    "moreover , since it can deal with an arbitrary trend without a priori knowledge , it can remove nonstationarity , including baseline drifts and motion artifacts @xcite , and the procedure may also be used as either high - pass or low - pass filter with superior noise - removal properties than linear filters , wavelet shrinkage , or chaos - based noise reduction schemes @xcite .",
    "based on the described adaptive decomposition , a fractal analysis can be conducted as follows .",
    "let \\{@xmath50 } be a stationary stochastic process with mean @xmath51 and autocorrelation function of type @xmath52 where @xmath3 is the hurst parameter .",
    "this is often called an increment process , and its power spectral density is @xmath53 .",
    "the integral of the increment process : @xmath54 on the other hand , is called a random walk process , and its power spectral density is @xmath55 . starting from an increment process , similarly to detrended fluctuation analysis @xcite , we first construct a random walk process using equation  ( [ rw ] ) . if , however , the original data can already be classified as a random walk - like process , then this step is not necessary , although for ideal fractal processes there is no penalty even if this step is done .",
    "next , for a window size @xmath12 , we determine , for the random walk process @xmath56 ( or the original process if it is already a random walk - like process ) , a global trend @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the length of the walk .",
    "the residual , @xmath59 , characterizes fluctuations around the global trend , and its variance yields the hurst parameter @xmath3 according to @xmath60^{1/2 } \\sim w^{h}. \\label{ada}\\ ] ] the validity of equation  ( [ ada ] ) can be proven if one starts from an increment process with the hurst parameter equal to @xmath3 . using parseval s theorem @xcite ,",
    "the variance of the residual data corresponding to a window size @xmath12 may be equated to the total power @xmath61 in the frequency range ( @xmath62 ) as @xmath63 where @xmath64 , and @xmath65 is the highest frequency of the data .",
    "when @xmath66 , we see that equation  ( [ ada ] ) has to be valid .",
    "in fact , the above treatment makes it clear that even if we start from a random walk process with the hurst exponent equal to @xmath3 , integration will give the process a spectrum of @xmath67 , and therefore , the final hurst parameter will be simply @xmath68 .",
    "this in turn indicates that there is indeed no penalty if one uses equation  ( [ rw ] ) when the data are already a random walk - like process .",
    "note that the proposed approach , if needed , can be readily extended and applied successfully to multifractal as well as higher dimensional data .",
    "-gram data ( @xmath69 points ) .",
    "blue ( circles ) and red ( diamonds ) curves depict results as obtained by means of detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) and adaptive fractal analysis ( afa ) , respectively , for three different values of @xmath3 .",
    "it can be observed that both methods yield consistent results , regardless of the shortage of the examined time series.,width=238 ]    the described fractal analysis approach , which we will refer to as adaptive fractal analysis ( afa ) , in general yields results that are consistent with the traditionally used detrended fluctuation analysis @xcite ( dfa ) , as can be concluded from results presented in figure  [ method ] . nevertheless , especially for processes having @xmath8 @xcite",
    ", afa may yield better scaling , which is why , although we analyze the culturomic trajectories with both methods , we rely on the results of afa for final interpretation .",
    "the potential advantage of adaptive fractal analysis over detrended fluctuation analysis is due to the fact that the trend for each window of size @xmath12 obtained by afa is smooth , while that obtained by dfa may change abruptly at the boundary of neighboring segments . for short nonstationary time series",
    "this may prove favorable for obtaining better scaling in the @xmath11 versus @xmath12 dependence .",

    "<S> culturomics was recently introduced as the application of high - throughput data collection and analysis to the study of human culture . here </S>",
    "<S> we make use of this data by investigating fluctuations in yearly usage frequencies of specific words that describe social and natural phenomena , as derived from books that were published over the course of the past two centuries . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the determination of the hurst parameter by means of fractal analysis provides fundamental insights into the nature of long - range correlations contained in the culturomic trajectories , and by doing so , offers new interpretations as to what might be the main driving forces behind the examined phenomena . quite remarkably , we find that social and natural phenomena are governed by fundamentally different processes . </S>",
    "<S> while natural phenomena have properties that are typical for processes with persistent long - range correlations , social phenomena are better described as nonstationary , on - off intermittent , or lvy walk processes . </S>"
