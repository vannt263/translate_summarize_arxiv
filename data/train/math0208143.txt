    "differential equations are used to model a very wide variety of phenomena .",
    "frequently , these differential models contain several parameters which are often varied or `` tuned '' to describe more accurately the phenomenon under study .",
    "thus , there is considerable interest , from both a pure and an applied point of view , to understand how the properties of solutions of a parametrized family of differential equations are affected by variation of the parameters .",
    "this philosophy is at the core of bifurcation theory .    one large class of differential equations which are particularly important in applications",
    "are _ retarded functional differential equations _ ( rfdes ) @xcite , which includes the class of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , the class of delay differential equations , as well as certain types of integro - differential equations , among others .",
    "these equations are used to model various phenomena in fields ranging from mathematical biology  @xcite to industrial processes  @xcite , and to atmospheric science  @xcite .",
    "the theory for both linear and nonlinear rfdes is rather well - developped  @xcite .",
    "essentially these equations behave like abstract odes on an infinite - dimensional ( banach ) phase space . thus",
    ", many results which are known for odes on finite - dimensional spaces have analogs in the context of rfdes .",
    "for example , in the neighborhood of an equilibrium point of a nonlinear rfde , there exists local invariant manifolds ( stable , unstable and center manifolds ) which are tangent to the corresponding invariant subspaces of the linearized equations about the equilibrium point , and on which the flow near the equilibrium is either exponentially attracting ( stable manifold ) , exponentially repelling ( unstable manifold ) , or non - hyperbolic ( center manifold ) . in the context of bifurcation theory , the center manifold reduction of the flow is important , since this is where bifurcations ( qualitative changes in the flow ) take place as parameters are varied . in applications ,",
    "there have been many studies ( see for example @xcite ) of specific rfdes where stability and bifurcations of equilibria were investigated using the center manifold reduction theory developped in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "another example of the similarity between odes and rfdes is in @xcite , where the theory of poincar - birkhoff normal forms was extended to rfdes .",
    "one aspect of the bifurcation theory of rfdes which , surprisingly , has not yet been developped is that of extending arnold s theory @xcite on versal unfoldings of matrices to the case of parameter - dependent linear rfdes .",
    "this is the purpose of our present paper .",
    "versal unfoldings of rfdes for certain singularities have been computed for particular classes of rfdes in the study of restrictions on the possible flows on a center manifold see  @xcite .",
    "these unfoldings are computed using the normal form theory of faria and magalh@xmath0es  @xcite .",
    "however no attempt is made to give a systematic treatment of unfolding of linear rfdes .",
    "we adopt the following strategy .",
    "we begin with a linear rfde @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is a bounded linear functional operator ) whose semiflow restricted to a finite - dimensional subspace is defined by the matrix @xmath3 . using a versal unfolding of @xmath3",
    ", we explicitly construct a parametrized family @xmath4 of bounded linear functional operators whose finite - dimensional restricted semiflow is defined by a versal unfolding @xmath5 of the matrix @xmath3 . in comparison , the realisation of linear odes by linear rfdes obtained by faria and magalh@xmath0es  @xcite provides an existence result . using the hahn - banach theorem",
    "they show the following .",
    "for any finite dimensional matrix @xmath3 , a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a bounded linear operator @xmath2 from @xmath6,{\\mathbb r}^{n})$ ] into @xmath7 with infinitesimal generator having spectrum containing the spectrum of @xmath3 is that @xmath8 be larger than or equal to the largest number of jordan blocks associated with each eigenvalue of @xmath3 .",
    "while some of the proofs in our paper have a flavor similar to the ones in  @xcite , our results can not be deduced from realisability results .",
    "recall that for a given @xmath9 matrix @xmath3 with complex entries , a _",
    "@xmath10-parameter unfolding _ of @xmath3 is a @xmath10-parameter analytic family of matrices @xmath5 such that @xmath11 for some @xmath12 .",
    "the unfolding @xmath5 is said to be a _",
    "versal unfolding _ of @xmath3 if for all @xmath13-parameter unfoldings @xmath14 of @xmath3 ( with @xmath15 ) , there exists an analytic mapping @xmath16 and an analytic family of invertible matrices @xmath17 satisfying    @xmath18    thus , a versal unfolding of @xmath3 is , up to similarity transformations , a general analytic perturbation of @xmath3 .",
    "a versal unfolding is said to be _ mini - versal _ if the dimension of the parameter space is the smallest possible for a versal unfolding . of course , the concept of versal unfolding of matrices is of importance not only to linear differential equations , but to nonlinear differential equations as well , since questions of stability and bifurcations of equilibria in nonlinear systems always involve an analysis of an associated linearized system .",
    "it is therefore important to understand the dependence of the associated matrix on system parameters ( i.e. in the case where the resulting unfolding is not versal , there are restrictions on the movement of the eigenvalues , which may influence the possible range of dynamics ) .    in the space @xmath19 of @xmath9 matrices with complex entries ,",
    "let @xmath20 denote the similarity orbit of the matrix @xmath3 .",
    "we will use the following sufficient criterion for versality which can be found in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath5 be a @xmath10-parameter unfolding of the matrix @xmath3 . if @xmath21 where @xmath22 is such that @xmath11 and @xmath23 denotes the tangent space to @xmath20 at @xmath24 , then @xmath5 is a versal unfolding of @xmath3 .",
    "if the codimension of @xmath25 is equal to @xmath10 , then the unfolding is mini - versal .",
    "[ arwiprop ]    as motivation for our analysis in this paper , consider a parameter dependent nonlinear rfde @xmath26 which has a non - hyperbolic equilibrium , which we assume for the sake of simplicity to be at @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "as previously mentioned , a crucial step in the analysis of the bifurcations and stability of this equilibrium is to perform a parameter dependent center manifold reduction of the rfde @xcite in order to obtain a parameter dependent nonlinear @xmath29-dimensional ode @xmath30 where @xmath3 is a @xmath9 constant matrix , and @xmath31 is _ nonlinear in @xmath32 and @xmath33_. the emphasis is important , since terms which are parameter dependent and linear in @xmath32 are contained in the expression for @xmath31 and they are the ones which unfold the matrix @xmath3 .",
    "thus , it is natural to investigate the versality of this unfolding , for reasons that we have previously mentioned .",
    "however , the potential difficulty here is that the reduction process for rfdes to finite - dimensional invariant manifolds introduces restrictions on the possible types of nonlinearities @xmath31 which can be achieved in ( [ eq1])@xcite .",
    "thus , there is no _ a priori _ guarantee that a versal unfolding of the matrix @xmath3 can be achieved in @xmath31 by this reduction process , even if we have perhaps many parameters ( e.g. more than the codimension of the singular matrix ) in the original rfde .",
    "it is clear that only terms which are linear in @xmath34 in the right - hand side of ( [ eq0 ] ) contribute to terms which are linear in @xmath32 in the right - hand side of ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "thus , we restrict our attention to the case where ( [ eq0 ] ) is a parametrized family of linear rfdes .",
    "we have two main results .",
    "the first gives a sufficient condition on the parametrized linear rfde ( [ eq0 ] ) which guarantees that the right - hand side of ( [ eq1 ] ) is a versal unfolding of the matrix @xmath3 .",
    "the second main result is twofold : first , we show that despite the previously mentioned restrictions on @xmath31 in ( [ eq1 ] ) , it is always possible to realize a versal unfolding of @xmath3 by a suitable choice of parameter - dependent rfde in ( [ eq0 ] ) ; and furthermore , we give a `` canonical '' method of computing such a parameter - dependent rfde in terms of delay differential operators .",
    "the theory is then illustrated with several examples .",
    "although our original interest and motivation lies in bifurcation theory ( i.e. @xmath3 in ( [ eq1 ] ) has all of its eigenvalues on the imaginary axis ) , there is no additional complication in considering a reduction of ( [ eq0 ] ) to a general finite - dimensional invariant manifold ( i.e. not necessarily a center manifold ) .",
    "therefore , we develop the theory in this general context .    as is the case for arnold s theory of versal unfoldings of matrices , we develop our theory by working in complex spaces ; since the diagonalization theory is much simpler in this context .",
    "versal unfoldings in the real case can be constructed by a decomplexification of the complex unfolding , as is done in @xcite and which we illustrate in section 7 .",
    "let @xmath35,{\\mathbb c}^n)$ ] be the banach space of continuous functions from the interval @xmath36 $ ] , into @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) endowed with uniform norm .",
    "we are interested in the linear homogeneous rfde @xmath39 where @xmath2 is a bounded linear operator from @xmath40 into @xmath37 .",

    "we suppose that @xmath50 is a non - empty finite set of eigenvalues of @xmath44 , with corresponding generalized @xmath29-dimensional eigenspace @xmath51 .",
    "using adjoint theory , it is known that we can write @xmath52 where @xmath53 is invariant under the semiflow of ( [ fde ] ) , and invariant under @xmath44 .",
