    "ferromagnetic tunnel junctions ( ftj ) such as ferromagnet(fm)/barrier / fm junctions  @xcite have been recently applied to elements in magnetic random access memories ( mram ) because of their tunnel magnetoresistance ( tmr ) effect , which appears when an applied magnetic field changes an angle between magnetizations of two fms . in the practical use , a spin - valve type  @xcite is usually adopted . for the writing process",
    ", the magnetization of only one side of the fm is changed under the applied field , so the magnetization configurations between two fms are parallel ( p ) or anti - parallel ( ap ) ; for the reading process , the difference in resistance between the p and ap cases is used .    for the ftj",
    ", much effort has been made to mainly increase tmr ratio , which is defined by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is conductance of the p ( ap ) case .",
    "experimentally , the tmr ratio of co - fe / al - o / co - fe junctions reached 60% at room temperature  @xcite in investigations of the influence of the fabrication method for oxide barrier on the tmr effect , epitaxially grown ga@xmath3mn@xmath4as / alas / ga@xmath3mn@xmath4as junctions have exhibited the tmr ratio more than 70% at 8 k  @xcite , and the tmr ratio of co / fe - doped al@xmath5o@xmath6/ni@xmath7fe@xmath8 junctions has been successfully enhanced as compared to those with undoped al@xmath5o@xmath6  @xcite . theoretically , the tmr ratio for epitaxial fe / mgo / fe(001 ) junctions became more than 300% because of coherent tunneling with conservation of intralayer momentum  @xcite , and tmr ratios for junctions having a sheet with 100% spin polarized dopants in the barrier  @xcite and the fe - doped barrier  @xcite were enhanced because of spin polarization of resonant states inside the barrier and spin dependent energy levels inside it , respectively .",
    "furthermore , double barrier junctions of fm / barrier / nonmagnetic layer / barrier / fm reached a tmr ratio of more than 5000% at a specific thickness of the nonmagnetic layer , as a result of spin dependent conduction through resonant levels in the layer  @xcite .    by comparing such ftj with elements  @xcite in other memories such as flash memory  @xcite",
    ", however , we find out that there are few studies on multiple valued ( or multi - level ) cell property  @xcite , which allows many bits to be stored in each memory cell , and reduces memory cell size by 1/(the number of bits ) .",
    "if such a property is included in the ftj , they will function as a more efficient memory cell than the conventional one .",
    "in this paper , we theoretically investigate the multiple valued cell property  @xcite in the ftj . in a possible scheme ,",
    "recorded states are supposed to be four magnetization configurations of two fms consisting of ( up , up ) , ( up , down ) , ( down , up ) , ( down , down ) , which are obtained by applying magnetic fields to respective fms .",
    "the ftj correspond to 2bits memory cells .",
    "then , in order to sense all the states , 4-valued conductances corresponding to the respective states are obviously necessary . by paying attention to the magnitude of total magnetization in the whole system , a model to obtain such conductances is considered to be fm1/spin - polarized barrier ( spb)/fm2 junctions , where the fm1 and fm2 have different spin polarizations and magnetization in the barrier is pinned , according to the following procedure .",
    "first , a difference of conductances between ( up , up ) and ( down , down ) will appear , if the barrier is a spb .",
    "second , a difference between ( up , down ) and ( down , up ) will be obtained by introducing the fm1 and fm2 , in addition to the spb . in actual calculations , the junctions exhibit 4-valued conductances .",
    "further , the proposed idea is applied to the case of the barrier having localized spins .",
    "when all the localized spins are pinned parallel to the magnetization axes of fm1 and fm2 , 4-valued conductances are explicitly obtained in the case of many localized spins . finally , objectives for an ideal spb to certainly observe such conductances are discussed .",
    "we first investigate the conductance of the fm1/spb / fm2 junctions , where the barrier merely has spin dependent height due to the pinned magnetization , and its material is not specified for general discussions . to simply find intrinsic properties ,",
    "the one - dimensional systems are adopted . within the green s function technique  @xcite ,",
    "the conductance is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is spin of a tunnel electron , and @xmath11 denotes the local density - of - states ( dos ) at an interfacial layer in fm1(2 ) at the fermi level , @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 is a spin dependent transmission coefficient including the spin - flip process of @xmath14 , and is proportional to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the @xmath17 component of an element between both edge sites in the barrier for the green s function of the whole system  @xcite .",
    "as the barrier height becomes higher , @xmath13 decreases .    using eq .",
    "( [ cond ] ) , we obtain conductances for respective configurations , where the magnetization state of fm1 ( fm2 ) is represented by @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , which is @xmath20 or @xmath21 . by introducing @xmath22 ,",
    "we have @xmath23 with @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 correspond to local doss at @xmath12 for majority spin and for minority spin of the case of @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "in addition , the relation of @xmath32 is satisfied .",
    "note here that the case of @xmath33=1 and @xmath34 has 2-valued conductances , and then @xmath35 ( or @xmath36 ) results in the julliere model  @xcite .    by putting @xmath34",
    ", we investigate @xmath37 @xmath38 $ ] dependence of @xmath39 .",
    "in particular , we study the influence on @xmath39 of a change from the non - spin - polarized barrier to the spin - polarized one .    the fm / spb / fm junctions with @xmath40 and @xmath41 exhibit 3-valued conductances , while those with @xmath42 have 2-valued conductances .",
    "figure 1(a ) shows @xmath39 with @xmath43  @xcite , which are determined by the least squares method such that ( @xmath44,@xmath45 ) becomes ( 0.55,0.1 ) at @xmath37=1 .",
    "the quantities @xmath45 and @xmath44 decrease nearly linearly with increasing @xmath37 , while @xmath45 crosses @xmath44 at @xmath46 , and @xmath45 is smaller than @xmath44 for @xmath47 .",
    "the differences of @xmath39 between all the configurations become large near @xmath37=1 .    the fm1/spb / fm2 junctions with @xmath48 and @xmath49 exhibit 4-valued conductances , while those with @xmath42 or @xmath50 have 3-valued conductances .",
    "figure 1(b ) shows @xmath39 with @xmath51=0.38 and @xmath50=0.58  @xcite , which is determined by the least squares method such that ( @xmath44,@xmath52,@xmath45 ) becomes ( 0.7,0.4,0.1 ) at @xmath37=1 .",

    "as an example to obtain @xmath13 difinitively , we focus on the barrier having localized spins due to magnetic ions or ions in magnetic particles , which are configured linearly and with same interval [ see fig .",
    "we investigate @xmath39 through a quantum well potential structure with dependence on spin by assuming that the potential of conduction level at the magnetic ion site is lower than that in the original barrier part , and magnetic couplings between the localized spins and the magnetizations in the fms are so small that influence on the spin dependent conduction might be negligible .",
    "we use a single orbital tight - binding model with nearest neighbor transfer integrals , and take into account exchange interactions between the tunnel electron spin and localized spins  @xcite , while couplings between localized spins are not specified because their ferromagnetic , antiferromagnetic , and canted states are considered . in the unit of magnitudes of the transfer integral ,",

    ". using eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) , @xmath65 is written as @xmath66 with @xmath67 , and @xmath68 is a green s function on sites unconnected to the other sites , and is exactly expressed as @xmath69 with @xmath70 @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "the first and second terms correspond to components of a lower level with @xmath73 and of an upper level with @xmath74 , respectively . for @xmath58=0",
    ", @xmath75 certainly has the non - spin - polarized feature . for @xmath76 ,",
    "when @xmath60 is along the quantum axis , i.e. , @xmath77 , @xmath75 has only the spin - up ( -down ) component for the lower ( upper ) level , which represents the largely spin - polarized feature , while when @xmath60 perpendicular to the quantum axis , @xmath75 shows no difference between the spin - up and spin - down in both the levels , which represents the non - spin - polarized feature .    in this calculation",
    ", we utilize the same set ( @xmath78)=(0.38,0.58 ) as above , and choose @xmath79=3.5 , where a condition of @xmath80 is used , based on strong on - site coulomb repulsions at magnetic ion sites  @xcite .",
    "further , localized spins are assumed to exist parallel to @xmath81-plane , and an angle at odd ( even ) sites between localized spins and @xmath82-axis is written as @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) [ see fig .",
    "2(b ) ] .    in fig .",
    "3(a ) , we show the @xmath85 dependence of @xmath39 for @xmath86 . at @xmath85=0 ,",
    "the difference of @xmath39 exists only between the p and ap cases . with increasing @xmath85 , each @xmath39 approaches to its saturation value , which corresponds just to each @xmath39 at @xmath87 shown in fig .",
    "it is worth noting that each @xmath39 of @xmath62=8 saturates more rapidly than that of @xmath62=2 .",
    "such behavior reflects the fact that @xmath33 of @xmath62=8 decreases with @xmath85 more drastically than that of @xmath62=2 according to @xmath88 } { \\sinh^2 \\kappa_\\uparrow/ \\sinh^2 [ \\kappa_\\uparrow ( n+1 ) ] } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath89  @xcite . when the decay exponentials in the hyperbolic sine of eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) can be neglected owing to large @xmath90 , we have @xmath91 , where @xmath92 , defined by @xmath93 , increases with @xmath85  @xcite .    figure 3(b )",

    "a condition of @xmath94=@xmath950.5 ( 0 ) represents localized spins oriented in @xmath96 ( @xmath82 ) direction . at @xmath97 ,",
    "only the difference between the p and ap cases is present .",
    "the difference at @xmath97 of @xmath62=8 is much smaller than that of @xmath62=2 , because the spin - flip tunneling process increases owing to an increase of transverse components of localized spins . as @xmath83 approaches to 0",
    ", differences of @xmath39 among all the configurations become large .    in fig .",
    "3(c ) , we investigate the @xmath83 dependence of @xmath39 for @xmath85=1 and @xmath98 .",
    "the change of @xmath83 from @xmath99 to 0 corresponds to that from antiferromagnetic state to ferromagnetic one via canted ones .",
    "the quantity @xmath39 exhibits a difference only between the p and ap cases at @xmath100 ; they individually behave for @xmath101 ; and there are large differences between all the configurations at @xmath102 .",
    "we now comment on a comparison with previous works . as far as we are aware ,",
    "resistance versus magnetic fields observed for co / fe - doped al@xmath5o@xmath6/ni@xmath7fe@xmath8 junctions  @xcite , which may be similar to fm1/spb / fm2 junctions with the above mentioned barrier having localized spins , have not confirmed 3-valued or 4-valued conductances .",
    "note that localized spins of fe were not pinned , and @xmath37 might possibly be small . on the other hand , the observed enhancement of several per cent in the tmr ratio appears to originate from the behavior of @xmath44 or @xmath52 for @xmath103 , as shown in fig . 1 .",
    "also , the increase of the tmr ratio with @xmath85 shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) agrees qualitatively with that of the previous theoretical study  @xcite .",
    "we here consider an ideal spb to certainly observe 3-valued or 4-valued conductances .",
    "for the barrier having magnetic particles , we give two objectives , which are    * to strongly pin the magnetization of magnetic particles in the barrier parallel to magnetization axes of fms , and * to diminish the magnetic couplings between magnetic particles and fms .    as for ( i ) , we propose magnetic particles having a coercive field higher than those of fms .",
    "also , it may be effective to apply exchange bias from an antiferromagnet  @xcite to the magnetic particles . here",
    ", the antiferromagnet is located not between the fms and the spb but at the side of the spb in the ftj , meaning that few conduction electrons may flow in the antiferromagnet because it is not connected to fm electrodes . for (",
    "ii ) , we suppose that distances between magnetic particles and fms should be well controlled so that the magnetic dipole - dipole interactions between them become very small and have little influence on the spin dependent conduction .    as a realistic spb , which could satisfy such objectives , we bear in mind of a carbon nanotube encapsulating magnetic particles  @xcite by the following reasons : size of magnetic particles may be close to that of a single domain particle by tuning conditions of fabrication .",
    "note that the coercive field was recently observed as about 0.5 koe at 300 k even for fe particles encapsulated with non - single domain size of about 70 nm  @xcite .",
    "further , magnetic particles can be encapsulated not only at edges of the nanotube  @xcite but also in the inner region  @xcite , where distances between the particles and the edges may be tunable by controlling nanotube growth processes .",
    "it is also mentioned that the nanotube itself has very long spin - flip scattering lengths which extend 130 nm at least  @xcite .    as another spb",
    ", we propose a ferromagnetic barrier such as eus , where bulk eus has a band gap of 1.65 ev and the exchange splitting of conduction band of 0.36 ev  @xcite .",
    "in fact , it has been shown experimentally that the eus tunnel barrier can be used as a highly efficient spin filter  @xcite , and it has been theoretically found that the ferromagnetic barrier largely contributes to an increase of the tmr ratio in double ferromagnetic barrier junctions , where external and central electrodes are nonmagnetic  @xcite . when such a ferromagnetic barrier is used as the spb , we design fm1/barrier / spb / barrier / fm2 junctions , where the antiferrmagnet may be layered at the side of the spb in order to pin the magnetization of the spb strongly .",
    "> from the viewpoint of device applications , we anticipate that the 2bits / cell mram will be realized using 4-valued conductances . at the same time",
    ", we mention that the ftj with magnetization reversals between @xmath31 and @xmath104 show larger tmr ratio compared with the conventional spin - valve type  @xcite , in the case of a largely spin - polarized barrier .",
    "we have theoretically investigated the multiple valued cell property , which is in principle realized by sensing three or four states recorded with magnetization configurations of two fms .",
    "the fm / spb / fm junctions have 3-valued conductances to sense three states , and the fm1/spb / fm2 junctions , where the fm1 and fm2 have the different local doss at @xmath12 , have 4-valued conductances to sense four states . when the barrier has localized spins , differences among those conductances are strongly influenced by the magnitude of the interaction between the tunnel electron spin and localized spins , and the directions of the localized spins . in the case of many localized spins ,",
    "respective conductances rapidly approach saturation values .",
    "further , objectives for the ideal spb to observe such conductances have been given and considered .",
    "we expect that the present proposal on 4-valued conductances will contribute a great deal to the realization of the 2bits / cell mram in the near future .",
