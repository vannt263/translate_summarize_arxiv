    "a series of astronomical observations over the past decade indicate that our universe confirms a state of accelerated expansion @xcite .",

    "there exists some unknown energy , which is called dark energy ( de ) , to realize the accelerated expansion .",
    "a cosmological constant ( @xmath1 ) has effective equal pressure to minus its energy density ( equation of state @xmath2 ) consistent with preliminary measurements , but in supersymmetric theories the most natural scale for @xmath1 is at least as large as 100 gev .",

    "the @xmath1cdm model confronts problems , which are namely  fine - tuning \" and  cosmic coincidence \" @xcite .",
    "other the simplest extension of @xmath1 is the de with a constant @xmath3 , which is the corresponding cosmological model so - called that @xmath4 dm model @xcite .",
    "recent reviews @xcite are useful for a brief knowledge of de models . in recent years , the holographic de ( hde )",
    "has been studied as a possible candidate for de .",
    "it is commonly believed that the holographic principle @xcite is just a fundamental principle of quantum gravity too .",
    "holographic principle is illuminated by investigations of the quantum property of black holes . in this sense",
    ", the number of freedom s degrees of a physical system should be finite and scale with its bounding area rather than with its volume .",
    "it should be constrained by an infrared cut - off @xcite . according to @xcite",
    "the energy contained in a region of size @xmath5 must not exceed the mass of a black hole of the same size , which means , in terms of energy density , @xmath6 . based on this idea ,",
    "@xcite proposed the hde model , where the infrared cutoff is taken to be the size of event horizon for de .",
    "more details about the hde was studied by many authors @xcite . +",
    "another proposal to explore the nature of de within the framework of quantum gravity is the agegraphic de ( ade ) @xcite .",
    "this model takes into account the heisenberg uncertainty relation of quantum mechanics together with the gravitational effect in general relativity .",
    "the ade model considers spacetime and matter field fluctuations responsible for de .",
    "however , the ade model might contain an inconsistency @xcite .",
    "so to overcome this problem , which after the ade model , the authors @xcite proposed an alternative model of de , is namely the  new agegraphic de \" ( nade ) .",
    "the nade models have been studied in plentiful detail by @xcite .",
    "+ it was purposed the use of some perfect fluid with an equation of state and called it as chaplygin gas ( cg ) @xcite .",
    "the cg is one of the candidate of de models to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "the striking features of cg de is that it can be assumed as a possible unification of dm and de .",
    "the cg plays a duplex role at different epoch of the history of the universe : it can be as a dust - like matter in the early time ( i.e. for small scale factor @xmath7 ) , and as a cosmological constant at the late time .",
    "et al_. @xcite have found the generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) which is better fit for latest supernova data .",
    "after the gcg was introduced , the new model of cg which is called modified cg ( mcg ) was proposed .",
    "an interesting feature of mcg is its ability to explain the evolution of the universe from radiation to @xmath1cdm @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it is considered the reconstructing between the scalar field and the de models , which is the case , for example , holographic quintessence @xcite , holographic tachyon @xcite , interacting new agegraphic tachyon , k - essence and dilaton @xcite .",
    "meanwhile the simplest explanation of the phantom de is provided by a scalar field with a negative kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "such a field may be motivated from s - brane constructions in string theory @xcite .",
    "the constraint on parameters in gcg model , which is discussed briefly by using the observational data . specifically , by inflicting that the energy density of the scalar field must match to the hde and the nade chaplygin gas density",
    ", it was demonstrated that the equation of fields for the interacting case reproduces the equation of field for hde and nade models . under such circumstances we use a measurement of the hubble parameter as a function of redshift to derive constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "it has also been used to constrain parameters of hde and nade chaplygin gas models .",
    "+ all of these considerations are mainly investigated in a spatially flat homogeneous and isotropic universe which described by friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe .",
    "the theoretical studies and experimental data , which support the existence of an anisotropic phase , lead to consideration the models of universe with anisotropic back ground . since , the universe is almost isotropic at a large scale , the study of the possible effects of an anisotropic universe in the early time makes the bianchi type i ( bi ) model as a prime alternative for study .",
    "et al_. @xcite investigated that removing a bianchi component from the wmap data can account for several large - angle anomalies leaving the universe to be isotropic .",
    "thus the universe may have achieved a slight anisotropic geometry in cosmological models regardless of the inflation .",
    "further , these models can be classified according to whether anisotropy occurs at an early stage or at later times of the universe .",
    "the models for the early stage can be modified in a way to end inflation with a slight anisotropic geometry @xcite .",
    "very recently , hossienkhani @xcite investigated the interacting ghost de model with the quintessence , tachyon and k - essence scalar field in an anisotropic universe . in @xcite by introducing an interacting between de and dm it was found that the equation of state parameter of the interacting de can cross the phantom line",
    "however , the problem was restricted to the cases that the equation of motion parameter of the universe and anisotropy parameter , are a constant , and the role of time dependence of them was neglected .",
    "+ hence , our purpose in this work is to establish a correspondence between the hde , nade and the gcg model .",
    "we consider the universe which has an anisotropic characteristic and we study the effect of time dependence of anisotropy parameter of the bi universe and reconstruct the potential and the dynamics of the scalar field which describe the chaplygin cosmology .",
    "the paper is organized as following . in section 2",
    "we introduce the general formulation of the field equations in a bi metric .",
    "then we describe the evolution of background cosmology with generalized chaplygin gas de . in section 3",
    "we establish the correspondence between the interacting hde and the gcg model in bi universe .",
    "we reconstruct the potential and the dynamics for the scalar field of the gcg model , which describe accelerated expansion . in section 4 , this investigation was extended to the interacting new agegraphic gcg de model . in sections 5 , 6 we discuss the @xmath0 data and the linear evolution of perturbations in hde and nade generalized chaplygin gas models in bi and",
    "compare with the @xmath1cdm model .",
    "eventually we conclude and summarise our results in section 7 .",
    "to evaluate the influence of both the global expansion and the line of sight conditions on light propagation we examine an anisotropic accurate solution of the einstein field equations .",
    "the bi cosmology has different expansion rates along the three orthogonal spatial directions , given by the metric @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the scale factors which describe the anisotropy of the model .",
    "when @xmath12 , the bi model reduces to the flat frw model .",

    "<S> * abstract *    in this work , we establish a correspondence between the interacting holographic , new agegraphic dark energy and generalized chaplygin gas model in bianchi type i universe . in continue , we reconstruct the potential of the scalar field which describes the generalized chaplygin cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> cosmological solutions are obtained when the kinetic energy of the phantom field is order of the anisotropy and dominates over the potential energy of the field . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate observational constraints on the generalized chaplygin gas , holographic and new agegraphic dark energy models as the unification of dark matter and dark energy , by using the latest observational data . to do this we focus on observational determinations of the expansion history @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the hde model is better than the nade and generalized chaplygin gas models in an anisotropic universe . </S>",
    "<S> then , we calculate the evolution of density perturbations in the linear regime for three models of dark energy and compare the results @xmath1cdm model . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the analysis shows that the increase in anisotropy leads to more correspondence between the dark energy scalar field model and observational data .    </S>",
