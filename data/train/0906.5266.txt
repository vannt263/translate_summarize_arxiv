    "the kondo effect is a paradigm of strong correlation in condensed matter physics.@xcite this effect was first discovered in metals with magnetic impurity where the resistivity enhances with decreasing temperature below a characteristic temperature known as kondo temperature @xmath1 .",
    "such anomaly behavior was theoretically explained by j. kondo , hence the name  kondo effect \" , as the exchange interaction of the itinerant electrons with a localized spin state.@xcite soon , it was realized that the same correlation can dominate the low temperature transport properties of quantum dots with strong coulomb interaction.@xcite contrary to metals , the kondo effect leads to the enhancement of conductivity of the quantum dots .",
    "the advance of nanotechnology has experimentally demonstrated the kondo effect in artificial impurity systems ( semiconductor quantum dots@xcite , carbon nanotube@xcite or molecular conductors@xcite ) .",
    "the observation of kondo effect in these artificial quantum impurities has provided us the opportunity to study correlation phenomena by tuning the relevant parameters or driving the system out of equilibrium by either static or alternate magnetic or electric field . however , comparing with the great achievement of experiments , the theoretical understanding of kondo effect , especially at nonequilibrium , is far from adequate .",
    "this difficulty is due to the interplay of strong coulomb interaction and nonequilibrium which makes the exact solution of the kondo problem in nonequilibrium impossible . for the theoretical studies of kondo effect",
    ", several techniques , such as equation of motion of green s function@xcite , bosonization technique@xcite , and numerical renormalization group method@xcite , with their own advantages and limitations are developed .",
    "up to now , a large literature has been devoted to study the transport properties of kondo systems .",
    "most of these studies focused on the spectral density , linear or differential conductance and the current .    nowadays ,",
    "there is increasing interest in the study of the fluctuation of current , i.e. the current noise@xcite , in the kondo regime .",
    "the reasons for these studies are roughly two folds . on one hand",
    ", current noise measurement is expected to expose information about the quantum nature of electron transport in kondo regime . for kondo",
    "dot , the kondo correlation is quite sensitive to the external electric or magnetic field .",
    "it is thus difficult to get some key information such as the kondo temperature or the spectral density by direct experimental measurement .",
    "new setups or novel characteristic tools are needed to get the desired information .",
    "the current noise of kondo dot has shown its potential to provide information which is beyond the reach of traditional transport measurement .",
    "for instance , meir and golub studied the shot noise of kondo dot by several complementary approaches@xcite . they proposed to estimate @xmath1 by measuring the noise behavior of kondo dot .",
    "in addition , sindel _ et al . _ pointed out that the current noise can give an estimate of the kondo resonance in the equilibrium spectral density.@xcite on the other hand , as a signature of many - particle correlation , the current noise in kondo regime behaves quite differently from that of systems in single particle picture .",
    "the recent study of fractional charge is such an example .",
    "it is suggested that the noise measurement in kondo regime can lead to non - integer effective charge@xcite .",
    "moreover , the recent experimental measurement reveals surprisingly high current noise of carbon nanotube in the kondo regime where the conductance is close to the landauer conductance quantum.@xcite this is in great contrast to the predictions based on the noninteracting picture where the noise is expected to be negligible .    in this study",
    ", we show another example where the noise behavior of ac - driving quantum dots in kondo regime differs drastically from that of noninteracting dots . for non - interacting quantum conductors , lesovik and levitov ( ll )",
    "have predicted that the noise should show singularities at integers of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the dc bias , @xmath4 is the ac frequency.@xcite soon , this prediction was experimentally verified by measuring the noise power spectrum of a tunnel junction driven by microwave field .",
    "@xcite further theoretical studies , which in principle are still in single - particle pictures , showed that the singularity is robust against disorder effect and remains distinct at weak ac field@xcite ( actually , the singularity also depends on the ratio of @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the ac strength ) .",
    "none of these studies included correlation effect due to the coulomb interaction in the conductor . when there is finite coulomb interaction in the conductor , the noise behavior is expected to show different behavior since the electrons are correlated and the single - particle picture is no - longer valid .",
    "_ studied the noise in an ac - driving luttinger liquid.@xcite their results showed that the sharp features in @xmath7 is smoothed by the presence of coulomb interaction .",
    "since the electron transport in kondo regime is dominated by the strongly correlated kondo resonance , an immediate question one might ask is what happens to the photon - assisted noise singularities in the kondo regime .",
    "there exists some literatures which studied the transport properties of the ac kondo regime.@xcite most of them focus on the conductance or density of states of an ac - driving kondo dot .",
    "there have hitherto been few attempts to study the noise properties in ac - driving kondo dot@xcite .",
    "recently , the noise of kondo dot with ac gate modulation was studied@xcite by present authors by combining the floquet theorem and the slave boson mean field approximation . this mean - field approximation is valid when the kondo temperature defines largest energy scale .",
    "the numerical results showed that the photon - assisted noise of kondo dot shows no singularity at zero temperature and very low bias voltage .",
    "this smooth noise behavior was in great contrast to the predictions in single particle picture .",
    "limited by the validity of slave - boson mean field approximation , it remains unclear whether such singularity can appear in the kondo regime when the kondo temperature does not define the largest energy scale .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to investigate the photon - assisted noise of kondo dot beyond the slave boson mean field approximation .",
    "our approach is based on the noncrossing approximation ( nca)@xcite .",
    "for @xmath8 , where @xmath0 is the coulomb interaction strength , the nca has been shown to give reliable results both in the temperature regimes above and below @xmath1 .",
    "the splitting of the kondo resonance by external dc bias can also be captured .",
    "however , it fails to reproduce the fermi liquid behavior at very low temperature @xmath9 and gives non - physical results in the mixed - valence region.@xcite a suitable remedy of this shortcoming is possible as shown by kroha _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "the nca has also been applied to the time - dependent nonequilibrium transport through a kondo dot.@xcite solution of the the time - dependent nca in the time domain has been proposed and implemented.@xcite in the present study , we avoid to go to the pathological regime of nca@xcite and make use of the periodicity of the ac field .",
    "we combine the floquet theorem@xcite and the infinite-@xmath0 nca to investigate the transport properties , in particular the current noise properties of quantum dot with ac gate modulation .",
    "a suitable floquet - green s function formalism is developed to describe the dynamics of the system .",
    "the floquet theorem can capture the multi - photon process in a coherent non - perturbative way .",
    "our results show that for low ac frequency and low ac strength , the local density of states ( ldos ) of the kondo dot is almost insensitive to the ac gate field . for high ac frequency and strength",
    ", the kondo peak can be significantly suppressed with sidebands appearing in the density of states with distances to the kondo peak of multi - photon energy .",
    "such suppression is attributed to the decoherence induced by the photon - assisted processes@xcite .",
    "interestingly , the noise of quantum dots in ac - kondo regime shows dramatically different behavior from the ac driving noninteracting dots .",
    "the noise as a function of dc bias voltage does not show singularities in the kondo regime as we change the ac parameters from weak to strong values .",
    "one may thus utilize the photon - assisted noise behavior to tell apart the single - particle noninteracting resonant transport from the strongly correlated kondo resonance .",
    "the present paper is organized as following . in sec .",
    "ii , we give the details of the model hamiltonian and the floquet - green s function formalism with nca . in sec .",
    "numerical results of the ldos and noise properties of ac - driving kondo dot are presented . for the sake of comparison ,",
    "results for non - interacting dot are given to show the drastic different noise behaviors with or without many - body correlations . in sec .",
    "iv a conclusion is presented .",
    "the quantum transport through quantum dot is widely described by the single impurity anderson model coupled to two ideal leads .",
    "the system can be driven out of equilibrium by both dc bias and ac gate field . here",
    ", the ac field can be realized via a nearby ac gate which modulates the dot energy level . to investigate the coulomb effect on the noise behavior , we are interested in two situations , i.e. noninteracting dot without coulomb interaction and the kondo dot with strong on - site coulomb interaction .    for noninteracting dot , the system can be modeled by the single impurity anderson model with zero coulomb strength ( @xmath10 ) coupled to two ideal leads .",
    "the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the creation operator of @xmath13-electron with spin @xmath14 in the @xmath15th lead ( @xmath16 ) , @xmath17 is the lead electron energy .",
    "we assume a symmetric voltage drop across the dot .",
    "@xmath18 denotes the coupling matrix element of the lead electron and that in the dot .",
    "@xmath19 is the creation operator of electron in the dot with spin @xmath14 .",
    "its energy level can be modulated by an external gate voltage as @xmath20 . here",
    "spin - degeneracy is implied .",
    "usually , the simple assumption of zero coulomb interaction can not correctly capture the electron dynamics in nanostructures .",
    "for quantum dot with small - size , the charging energy can be much larger than the other energy scales . in these situation , we can approximately take the limit @xmath8 . for infinite @xmath0",
    ", the dot state can contain either zero or one electron .",
    "double occupancy may be neglected .",
    "a reliable tool to give a description of quantum dots with level deep below the fermi energy is the slave boson nca@xcite .",
    "the slave boson technique introduces some auxiliary particles to eliminate the non - quadratic term in the hamiltonian by replacing the electron operators by @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 annihilates the empty state and @xmath24 destroys a spin @xmath14 single occupation state .",
    "the infinite @xmath0 hamiltonian in slave boson language reads @xmath25    since the double occupancy is forbidden for @xmath26 , these slave particle operators must satisfy the constraint condition @xmath27      to study the transport properties out of equilibrium , we make use of the nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) method . the physical information is usually stored in two propagators , i.e. the retarded , @xmath28 , and the lesser , @xmath29 , green s functions which are defined in the real time axis .",
    "these green s functions can be related to the contour - ordered green s function @xmath30 , along the keldysh contour , by the langreth rules.@xcite the retarded green s function can be found from the dyson equation in the time - domain as @xmath31    the lesser green s function is given by the keldysh equation @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the advanced green s function and @xmath34 is the double - time retarded / lesser self - energy .",
    "usually , we need another green s function , the greater green s function @xmath35 which can be found by either using the keldysh equation by replacing @xmath36 with the greater self - energy @xmath37 or from the identity : @xmath38    for general time - dependent hamiltonian , the solution of the above equations remains challenging .",
    "however , since our hamiltonian is periodic in time , the floquet theorem can be used to simplify the solution.@xcite it is more desirable to work in an enlarged hilbert space which is defined by the direct product of the local basis in space and the basis for the time - periodic functions with the frequency @xmath4 . the basis set of time periodic functions which can be chosen to have the form @xmath39 with @xmath40 gives the so - called floquet basis to take into account the periodicity in a nonperturbative way .",
    "we will combine the floquet theory and the green s functions to investigate the time - dependent transport properties of quantum dot systems .",
    "the following notations are defined and will be used in the rest of the paper .",
    "the fourier transform of a double time function @xmath41 is defined as @xmath42 the periodicity of the function @xmath43 indicates that it can be decomposed into the floquet basis as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the fourier coefficient of the function @xmath46 .",
    "several authors have studied the time - dependent transport by the fourier coefficients of the floquet - green s functions @xcite , where only single label of the floquet states is needed . however , as we will see later , it is more convenient to write this time - period function @xmath47 in a matrix form @xmath48 in floquet space . in the following ,",
    "all operators expressed in matrix form in floquet space will be denoted by calligraphic symbols .",

    "the kondo dot behaves as if the ac gate is effectively screened to induce singularity in the noise behavior . comparing with the noninteracting resonance tunneling , the disappear of singularity behavior in noise of kondo dot",
    "may be ascribed to the fact that the electrons through the kondo resonance are not _ directly _ modulated by the ac field . although the energy level of the quantum dot @xmath121 is periodically modulated by the ac gate , the kondo peak is not directly driven by the ac field . for weak ac field where the ac frequency or ac strength are not in the order of the coupling strength or the energy level , the ac gate voltage is too small to drive the dot out of the kondo regime .",
    "strong correlation can still give rise to the sharp kondo peak at fermi energy .",
    "from the numerical results of ldos , we can see that ac modulation of kondo peak is much smaller than the applied ac gate which modulated the energy level of the dot .",
    "when the electrons are tunneling though the dot via the kondo resonance , their transport behavior is not significantly modulated by the ac field .",
    "the influence of the time - periodicity of the kondo peak to the electrons transport through the dot is negligibly small to show any singularities in the noise behavior .",
    "however , when the ac strength is strong enough to be comparable to @xmath121 or @xmath140 , for example @xmath141 in fig . 1 and 3 , the quantum dot can sometimes be driven out of the kondo regime by the ac field .",
    "the magnitude of the kondo peak can then be significantly suppressed due to the strong ac field . as a consequence ,",
    "the conductance declines drastically and deviates from the unitary limit . in these situations ,",
    "the kondo peak is then significantly suppressed and electron transmission probability becomes too small to show significant noise singularity .",
    "since the cusp of noise behavior can be smoothed by finite temperature , it is important to exclude the possibility that the smooth noise behavior shown in fig .",
    "3 is due to the finite temperature ( @xmath142 ) in our numerical simulation . in fig .",
    "4 , we plot the noise behavior as a function of dc bias voltage for the dot with different temperature .",
    "the ac frequency and ac strength is fixed at @xmath143 .",
    "the temperatures are chosen to be 0.01 , 0.005 and 0.001 , respectively . from fig .",
    "4 , we can see that even for the lowest temperature @xmath144 which is much lower than @xmath1 , no cusp is observed at @xmath133 in the noise behavior . together with the numerical results presented in ref . where no singularity is observed at zero temperature",
    ", the disappearance of cups in noise behavior can not be ascribed to the finite temperature .",
    "it is a generic feature of the strongly - correlated nature of kondo peak .    our numerical results together with those of ref .",
    "@xcite which are obtained with the help of the slave - boson technique have clearly shown that the strongly - correlated kondo resonance can display different noise behavior as compared with the noninteracting dot .",
    "usually , both the noninteracting resonant tunneling and kondo resonance will lead to similar results in conductance measurement .",
    "therefore , it is possible to make use of the distinct photon - assisted noise behavior to tell apart whether the resonant transport is via noninteracting resonance or strongly - correlated kondo resonance . such measurement has been in the reach of present technology .",
    "the recent experiment work@xcite has shown the possibility to conduct the noise measurement of nanostructures with ac field .",
    "the ability to distinguish the origin of the resonant transport may be helpful to answer the controversy about origin of the 0.7 anomaly in quantum point contacts , where the zero bias anomaly is due to whether the formation of strongly correlated kondo peak@xcite or single - particle resonant peak@xcite is still under debating .",
    "we wish the experiment of the photon - assisted noise measurement can be used to reveal the underlying physics of 0.7 anomaly .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a floquet - green s function formalism to investigate the noise properties of quantum dots in the ac - kondo regime .",
    "the coulomb correlation is taken into account by the infinite-@xmath0 nca . in principle , the ac effect can be considered non - perturbatively via the infinite floquet states .",
    "our results show that the kondo peak is robust against weak ac gate modulation .",
    "significant suppression of the kondo peak can be observed when the ac gate field becomes strong .",
    "the photon - assisted noise of kondo dots as a function of dc voltage does not show singularities which are expected for noninteracting resonant quantum dot at integer @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the dc bias voltage and @xmath4 is the ac frequency .",
    "these results suggest that we can tell resonant transport apart from the kondo resonance by photon - assisted noise measurement , which can not be distinguished via the conductance measurement .      in this appendix",
    ", we outline the derivation to reach the resolvent form of the floquet - green s function .",
    "it resembles much to the resolvent form of the green s function at steady state .",
    "the starting point is the definition of green s function in time domain @xmath145                      1 a. c. hewson , _ the kondo problem to heavy fermions _",
