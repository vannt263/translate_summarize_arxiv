    "<S> we present a description of this system in the framework of the diffusive - limit quasiclassical green - function theory and take into account the effects of inelastic scattering with arbitrary strength . </S>",
    "<S> supercurrent enhancement and suppression , including a marked transition to a @xmath0-junction are striking features leading to a fully tunable structure . </S>",
    "<S> the role of the degree of nonequilibrium , temperature , and materials choice as well as features like noise , switching time , and current and power gain are also addressed . </S>"
