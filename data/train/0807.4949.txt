    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , the manifestation of accretion onto massive black holes ( mbhs ) , have been recognized as a critical ingredient in galaxy formation and evolution .",

    "energy feedback from agns to their host galaxies is invoked to explain different aspects of massive galaxy evolution .",
    "agns may serve as the heating sources for cooling flows in clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "they may suppress star formation in their host galaxies and cause them to migrate from the blue cloud to the red - sequence in the color - magnitude plot @xcite and they may account for `` down - sizing '' galaxy evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as the most abundant population in the universe ,",
    "low - mass ( defined as stellar mass @xmath6 @xmath7 2@xmath810@xmath9 m@xmath3 through this paper ) galaxies act as the building blocks of massive galaxies .",
    "however , the current understanding of mbhs role in low - mass galaxy evolution is limited , leaving us with some basic questions : is the existence of bhs in low - mass galaxies as common as it is in massive galaxies ? are there two types of low - mass galaxy populations ( i.e. ones with bhs vs. ones without bhs ) ? how many low - mass galaxies experience an agn phase ?",
    "all of these questions are related to a more basic astrophysical problem : what is the black hole occupation function ( bhof ; the fraction of galaxies hosting either active or quiet bhs ) in low - mass galaxies ?",
    "searching for bhs in low - mass systems offers an unique opportunity to extend the mbh-@xmath10 correlation for massive galaxies , which not only tests the universality of the relation but also is required to understand the origin of the relation .",
    "although the mbh-@xmath10 relationship has been confirmed for low - mass systems in the local universe @xcite , some works suggest that the mbh-@xmath10 relationship may be replaced at low mass by a similar relation involving compact stellar nuclei @xcite .",
    "a better understanding of primordial mbh seed growth in the early universe may also benefit from the study of bhs in low - mass galaxies , as such work could reveal aspects of the accretion mode in a low gravitational potential and low metallicity environment and of the relative importance of mass growth through accretion and merging processes .",
    "for example , in low - mass galaxies , the impulsive kick from anisotropic gravitational emission during bh - bh mergers is thought to be strong enough to eject central bhs @xcite .",
    "understanding agn activity in low - mass galaxies can further constrain mbh seed formation theories . in a cold dark matter universe , the primordial mbh seeds form as remnants of population iii stars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or through the direct collapse of pre - galactic gas disks @xcite .",
    "the efficiencies in different formation scenarios predict a wide range in the local bhof in low - mass galaxies which can vary from zero to unity , while the prediction of the bhof in massive galaxies is invariably unity as constrained by observations @xcite .",
    "the current study of bhs in low mass galaxies is mostly limited to low redshift ( @xmath4 @xmath7 0.3 ) . despite a variety of investigations , it is still unclear how many local low - mass galaxies harbor bhs .",
    "the dynamical searches for mbhs have confirmed the existence of a bh in m32 @xcite , but not in m33 @xcite or ngc205 @xcite . searching for actively accreting bhs ( i.e. agns )",

    "it has been shown that the fraction of galaxies hosting active bhs depends on both bh mass and galaxy stellar mass , peaking at an intermediate mass range and falling toward higher and lower mass @xcite .",
