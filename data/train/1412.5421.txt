    "leaving aside interpretational issues  @xcite , the quantum state is an essential ingredient of quantum theory : once it is known , the probabilities of the outcomes of any possible measurement may be predicted .",
    "unfortunately , this elusive object can not be directly determined and must be inferred from a suitable set of measurements , which constitutes the province of quantum tomography  @xcite . although this might superficially appear as a mere statistical estimation , the positivity of the reconstructed state imposes stringent quantum constraints .",
    "indeed , these constraints endow the set of admissible states with a rich geometry , the boundaries of which somehow establish the realm of quantum world .",
    "delimiting these borders is , in general , a difficult conundrum .",
    "one way to ease these complications is to look at the problem using moments of the relevant quantities , with the hope that only a few of them will be important enough . as a simple",
    "yet illustrative example of this , let us examine a single - mode quantum field , which will serve as a thread in this work . the complex amplitude @xmath0 and the photon number @xmath1 for this system must obey @xmath2 , which can be readily obtained by a simple application of the cauchy - schwarz inequality  @xcite .",
    "the extremal states ( i.e. , those saturating the inequality ) turn out to be coherent states . hence , the difference between the average photon number and the square of the absolute value of the complex amplitude , which must be always positive , can be taken , up to second order , as a reliable indicator of the `` quality '' of a coherent state .    in classical signal processing , intensity and phase",
    "are the basic magnitudes specifying the field . at the quantum level , they translate into photon number and phase .",
    "however , the definition of a _ bona fide _ phase operator is beset of difficulties that have been the object of a heated debate  @xcite .",
    "here , we choose a surrogate approach that considers the phase properly encoded in the field quadratures , as it is routinely done in the theory of quantum nondemolition measurements  @xcite . while photon number lies at the heart of the discrete - variable quantum information , quadratures are the primary tool in the continuous - variable domain .",
    "photon number and quadratures bridge these two complementary worlds in a natural way .",
    "extremal states for these variables were investigated some years ago , fuelled by the search for noise minimum states  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the quite similar question of the uncertainty relation for the number and the annihilation operator was addressed  @xcite .",
    "our aim here is to push this research further and explore how these extremal states can be used for the diagnostics of nonclassicality .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : unnx ] we revisit the uncertainty relations for photon number and rotated quadratures , as well as loose approximations thereof .",
    "section  [ sec : add ] rounds off this discussion by looking at the extra restrictions that quantum theory imposes on the second - order moments of those variables and looking at the properties of intelligent states , which obey the equality in the previous uncertainty relations . based on those states ,",
    "we tailor performance measures especially germane to verify photon - added and schrdinger catlike states , among others .",
    "finally , our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : con ] .",
    "the system we are interested in is a single - mode electromagnetic field , which can be formally deemed as a harmonic oscillator .",
    "classically , it is characterized by a complex amplitude that contains information about both the magnitude and the phase of the field . in the quantum formalism",
    ", the mode is specified by the action of annihilation ( @xmath0 ) and creation ( @xmath3 ) operators satisfying the basic bosonic commutation relation  @xcite @xmath4 = { \\hat{\\openone } } \\ , .\\ ] ]    at optical frequencies , the common way of measuring the field is with homodyne detection  @xcite .",
    "the readout in this scheme involves moments of the rotated quadratures @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the phase of the local oscillator that can be externally varied .",
    "the reader should be careful about comparing results on quadrature , as there are a variety of normalizations used in the literature .",
    "notice that @xmath7 and that , for @xmath8 , they reduce to the canonical variables @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "they satisfy the canonical commutation relation ( in units @xmath11 throughout ) @xmath12 = i { \\hat{\\openone } } \\ , .\\ ] ]    since @xmath13 , where @xmath1 is the number operator , precise knowledge of the eigenvalue of @xmath14 restricts the possible knowledge about the quadratures .",
    "this is quantified by the commutation @xmath15 = -i { \\hat{p}}_{\\theta } \\ , , \\ ] ] which , in turn , implies the uncertainty relation @xmath16 here , @xmath17 denotes the variance of @xmath18 and the angular brackets @xmath19 mean averaging over the state of the system ( either pure or mixed ) .",
    "is the complex amplitude of the field and @xmath20 are the semiaxes of the uncertainty ellipse .",
    "the variable @xmath21 has been defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambdagen ] ) . ]",
    "equation  ( [ eq : uncrot ] ) is an exact relation , but depends on the local oscillator phase .",
    "differentiation with respect to @xmath6 leads to the extremal values @xmath20 of @xmath22 ; they can be written as  @xcite @xmath23 where the ( symmetrized ) covariance is @xmath24 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the quantity @xmath25 by @xmath26 with @xmath27 - \\arg [ \\langle { \\hat{a } } \\rangle ] $ ] , in terms of which eq .",
    "takes the form @xmath28^{2 }     \\ge |\\langle   { \\hat{a } } \\rangle|^2 \\ , .\\ ] ] apart from the invariant parameters @xmath20 , this expression also depends on the phase @xmath29 .",
    "however , this alternative presentation will allow us in the following to devise remarkable simplifications .",
    "besides , it is closely related to the customary ball - and - stick representation of quantum states in phase space  @xcite , where the quadratures @xmath9 and @xmath10 are taken as coordinates . in this picture ,",
    "sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasespa ] , the stick corresponds to the average value of the field @xmath30 and the ball corresponds to the fluctuations around the mean value .",
    "we display this area as a noise ellipse whose semiaxes are precisely the invariant parameters @xmath20 . in this way ,",
    "@xmath20 , which are eigenvalues of the covariance matrix and related to the universal quantum invariants  @xcite , play a key role in picturing the noise properties of the state  @xcite .",
    "the meaning of @xmath21 can be gathered at once from that figure .    as a final remark",
    ", we mention that the inequality ( [ eq : uncertight ] ) formally makes it possible to introduce a quantity like phase variance @xmath31 fulfilling a standard uncertainty relation with @xmath32 , namely @xmath33 ^{2 } \\frac{1}{|\\langle   { \\hat{a } } \\rangle|^{2 } } \\ , .\\ ] ] interestingly enough , an explicit calculation shows that this variance of the putative operator @xmath34 tallies with the smallest possible phase resolution in the shapiro - wagner phase concept  @xcite , if both quadrature operators are measured simultaneously .      the tight uncertainty relation ( [ eq : uncrot ] ) , or its equivalent ( [ eq : uncertight ] ) ,",
    "convey complete information , but they provide phase - dependent bounds .",
    "it might be interesting to work out weaker inequalities , which are independent of the orientation of the noise ellipse .",
    "a first option stems from the trivial observation that , according to ( [ eq : lambdagen ] ) , @xmath35 , so ( [ eq : uncertight ] ) can be relaxed to @xmath36 or , using @xmath37 , @xmath38 \\ge   | \\langle { \\hat{a } } \\rangle |^{2 } \\ , .\\ ] ]    the second possibility comes from the estimate @xmath39^{2 } \\le \\lambda_{+}^{2 } + \\lambda_{-}^{2}$ ] . now , we can write down @xmath40 which , using again @xmath37 , reads as @xmath41 this coincides with the expression obtained in ref .  @xcite . in spite of its simplicity , this inequality has a drawback : it can not be exactly saturated ( yet see the solution worked out in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . this can be confirmed by noticing that eq .",
    "( [ eq : gtot ] ) is just the sum of @xmath42 since @xmath43 .",
    "but these two relations can not be saturated simultaneously  @xcite and , as consequence , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gtot ] ) is not tight .    ) and ( [ eq : uncertnt2 ] ) as a function of the second - order moments of the variables involved . the plane along the diagonal corresponds to the constraint ( [ eq : ccov ] ) . in the right panel , we plot sections of the previous figure for several values of @xmath44 [ up to the value permitted by ( [ eq : ccov ] ) ] .",
    "the continuous line represents the bound ( [ eq : gtot ] ) and the shaded region designates the forbidden states . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we have plotted both approximate inequalities ( [ eq : uncertnt2 ] ) and ( [ eq : gtot ] ) in a three - dimensional space , with the moments @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath32 as axes .",
    "the region above these surfaces are the allowed states .",
    "we have also plotted several two - dimensional sections for different values of @xmath44 .",
    "it is evident that ( [ eq : uncertnt2 ] ) is tighter than ( [ eq : gtot ] ) , which actually is independent of @xmath44 .    in summary , the exact uncertainty relation ( [ eq : uncertight ] ) and its two weaker approximations ( [ eq : uncertnt1 ] ) and ( [ eq : gtot ] ) , fully specify the complementary nature of photon number and quadratures .",
    "they can be regarded as a sensible alternative to the more controversial uncertainty relations for number - phase observables  @xcite and their entropic counterparts  @xcite .",
    "the discussion thus far has capitalized on the variances as the proper estimator of quantum uncertainties , as it is generally accepted . to have a complete grasp of the problem , we have to assess also the constraints arising in the second - order moments involved in the problem , as they are not independent .",
    "as heralded in the introduction , an appropriate tool to delimit these moments is the generalized cauchy - schwarz inequality , which can be jotted down as  @xcite @xmath47 the equality occurs only for states where either @xmath48 , @xmath49 , or @xmath50 for some real scalar @xmath51 and @xmath52 being the density operator of the state .    a first application of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gcs ] ) , with @xmath53 , gives @xmath54 . as a result , from its very definition ,",
    "the covariance fulfills @xmath55 which is saturated by the coherent states . repeating the same procedure , but now with @xmath56 , we get @xmath57 this condition is equivalent to require @xmath58 , which has a direct physical interpretation in the ball - and - stick diagram analyzed before : for any physical state , the uncertainty area ( in quadrature units ) must be greater or equal than 1/4 . for coherent states",
    "the noise is equally distributed in both quadratures , @xmath59 , so they are depicted by a minimal circle . in squeezed states , the fluctuations in one quadrature",
    "are reduced below the value @xmath60 , at the expense of the corresponding increased fluctuations in the other quadrature , such that they preserve the minimum area .",
    "consequently , ( [ eq : h ] ) is saturated by squeezed states .    in this regard ,",
    "the condition of squeezing is just @xmath61 , which translates into @xmath62 which completes ( [ eq : h ] ) : the states fulfilling this inequality are not squeezed .    , ranged by the red hyperboloid .",
    "the blue cone is the boundary for moment representing squeezed light . in the right , we present a section of that figure ; the red - shadow region represent the feasible states , while the blue - shaded one gives the squeezed states . ]    the inequalities ( [ eq : h ] ) and ( [ eq : c ] ) can be represented in a very appealing way if we plot @xmath63 as a function of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath45 , as it is done in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . in these variables ,",
    "the equality in ( [ eq : h ] ) defines an hyperboloid with vertex in the point @xmath64 and all the moments about that hyperboloid are then possible . on the other hand , ( [ eq : c ] ) defines a cone with vertex in the same point @xmath65 : all points below the cone are squeezed .",
    "finally , we use once more eq .  , with @xmath66 , to get @xmath67 .",
    "assuming further the condition of zero complex amplitude , @xmath68 , we have @xmath69 which is saturated by the states spanned on the hilbert subspace of the superposition of coherent states @xmath70 , a general solution of the eigenvalue problem @xmath71 .",
    "we have been using the term extremal to loosely refer to those states for which the inequalities analyzed so far hold as equalities .",
    "if the lower bound in an uncertainty relation is state dependent , states satisfying the equality in the uncertainty relation need not give a minimum in the uncertainty product .",
    "this is the case with our fundamental relation ( [ eq : comrot ] ) , so it requires a distinction between intelligent states  @xcite and minimum uncertainty product states  @xcite .",
    "the intelligent states are solutions of the non - hermitian eigenvalue problem  @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the eigenvalue . although the solution to this equation has been already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we provide here a simplified alternative derivation . by introducing the complex parameter @xmath74 , where @xmath6 is the phase of the quadrature @xmath75 , reads @xmath76 since @xmath77 = m ( { \\hat{a}}^{\\dagger } + \\alpha^{\\ast } ) ^{m-1}$ ] for every integer @xmath78 ,",
    "one quickly guesses that the intelligent states we are looking for are @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a normalization constant and @xmath81 is a coherent state .",
    "we can also expand this expression in the fock basis : using the generating function of the generalized laguerre polynomials @xmath82  @xcite @xmath83 we get @xmath84 these states were found in a different context by yuen  @xcite , who called them near - photon - number eigenstates .",
    "they are also called crescent states  @xcite because the contours of their wigner function are sheared , due typically to a kerr nonlinearity@xcite .",
    "it is worth stressing the close similarity of these states , written as in eq .",
    "( [ crescent_states ] ) , with the expansion for fock - displaced states  @xcite , although their arguments differ in the sign , which introduces remarkable differences in the photon - number distribution .    ) , while the crosses represent the approximate intelligent states ( [ eq : sonest ] ) for several values of @xmath85 . ]    for weak fields @xmath86 , the crescent states reduce to the so - called @xmath78-photon - added coherent states  @xcite @xmath87 while in the strong - field limit @xmath88 they can be well approximated by the superposition of coherent and single - photon coherent added states @xmath89 with @xmath90 .",
    "for this particular case , we get @xmath91 and the normalization constant is @xmath92 we have plotted @xmath32 versus @xmath37 , as we did in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , for these states with varying values of @xmath85 .",
    "for comparison , we have included also the bound imposed by the weak uncertainty relation ( [ eq : gtot ] ) .",
    "as we can appreciate , the intelligent states are always very close to that bound .",
    "the final idea we wish to stress is that all these extremal states can be used as powerful tools to pinpoint important class of states .",
    "let us look at the crescent states ( or the approximation of @xmath78-photon - added coherent states treated before ) .",
    "since they are intelligent states for ( [ eq : comrot ] ) , the coefficient @xmath93^{2 }   \\ge 1 \\ , , \\ ] ] quantifies how far is a given state from being intelligent .",
    "this diagnosis is an interesting alternative to the full tomography , which is usually employed to certify this class of states  @xcite .",
    "since the reconstruction is performed in an infinite - dimensional hilbert space , the dimension of the reconstruction subspace predetermines the accuracy of the result .",
    "the inequality ( [ eq : uncertight ] ) becomes trivial in case of zero amplitude . in that case , however , the inequality ( [ eq : d ] ) provides a saturable bound . as discussed before ,",
    "the extremal states are given by the linear superposition of coherent states @xmath94 , including schrdinger catlike states @xmath95 the performance measure suitable to check these states is @xmath96 which again provides a robust and simple alternative to more sophisticated methods .",
    "it is obvious that equivalent measures can be employed for the other extremal states explored here .",
    "in short , we have formulated a tight uncertainty relation for photon number and rotated quadratures , which can be considered as a sensible and timely approach to the canonical pair number - phase .",
    "we have also constructed intelligent states for this uncertainty relation , retrieving the well - known crescent states .",
    "this saturable inequality , along with some other obtained from a systematic application of the cauchy - schwarz inequalities to all the second - order moments of the variables involved , can serve as a handy toolbox for nonclassical state diagnosis , an alternative to the more onerous and laborious quantum tomography .",
