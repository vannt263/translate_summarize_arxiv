    "the ( 001 ) surfaces of cubic perovskites have also been extensively investigated experimentally .",
    "for example , the srtio@xmath0 ( 001 ) surface relaxations and rumplings have been studied by means of low energy electron diffraction ( leed ) , reflection high - energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) , medium energy ion scattering ( meis ) , and surface x - ray diffraction ( sxrd ) measurements @xcite .",
    "the status of the degree of agreement between theory and experiment for these srtio@xmath0 surfaces is summarized in ref .",
    "abo@xmath0 perovskite ( 011 ) surfaces are considerably less - well studied than ( 001 ) surfaces , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "however , there has been a surge of recent interest , focusing mainly on srtio@xmath0 , in which stm , ups , xps @xcite , and auger spectroscopies as well as leed studies @xcite have been carried out .",
    "on the theory side , the first _ ab initio _ calculations for srtio@xmath0 ( 011 ) surfaces were performed by bottin _",
    "@xcite , who carried out a systematic study of the electronic and atomic structures of several ( 1@xmath31 ) terminations of the ( 011 ) polar orientation of the srtio@xmath0 surface .",
    "they found that the electronic structure of the stoichiometric srtio and o@xmath1 terminations showed marked differences with respect to the bulk as a consequence of the polarity compensation .",

    "the authors found that the surface energy of the o - terminated ( 011 ) surface is close to that of the ( 001 ) surface , suggesting that both ( 011 ) and ( 001 ) surfaces can coexist in polycrystalline srtio@xmath0 .",
    "most recently , we performed an _ ab initio _ study of srtio@xmath0 ( 011 ) surfaces @xcite using a hybrid hartree - fock ( hf ) and density - functional theory ( dft ) exchange - correlation functional , in which hf exchange is mixed with becke s three - parameter dft exchange and combined with the nonlocal correlation functional of perdew and wang ( b3pw ) @xcite .",
    "our calculations indicated a remarkably large increase in the ti - o bond covalency at the tio - terminated ( 011 ) surface , significantly larger than for the ( 001 ) surfaces .",

    "they found that the o - terminated ( 011 ) surface had the smallest cleavage energy among ( 011 ) surfaces , but that this value was still twice as large as the cleavage energy needed for the formation of a pair of complementary ( 001 ) surfaces .",

    "the only existing _ ab initio _ study of catio@xmath0 ( 011 ) polar surfaces was performed by zhang _",
    "@xcite in addition to the ( 001 ) surfaces , they studied four possible non - polar terminations of the ( 011 ) surface , namely the tio , ca , asymmetric a - type o , and symmetric b - type o terminations .",
    "the results indicated that the most favorable surfaces are the cao - terminated ( 001 ) surface , the a - type o - terminated ( 011 ) surface , and the tio@xmath1-terminated ( 001 ) surface , in that order .    with the sole exception of the calculation on catio@xmath0 by zhang _",

    "the features of the crystal-2003 code that are most important for this study are its ability to calculate the electronic structure of materials within both hartree - fock and kohn - sham hamiltonians and its ability to treat isolated 2d slabs without artificial repetition along the @xmath4-axis .",
    "however , in order to employ the linear combination of atomic orbitals ( lcao)-gtf method , it is desirable to have optimized basis sets ( bs ) .",
    "the bs optimization for srtio@xmath0 , batio@xmath0 , and pbtio@xmath0 perovskites was developed and discussed in ref .",
    "here we employ this bs , which differs from that used in refs .  [ ] by inclusion of polarizable @xmath5-orbitals on o ions .",
    "it was shown @xcite that this leads to better agreement of the calculated lattice constant and bulk modulus with experimental data . for the ca atom we used the same bs as in ref .",
    "our calculations were performed using the hybrid exchange - correlation b3pw functional involving a hybrid of non - local fock exact exchange , lda exchange and becke s gradient corrected exchange functional @xcite , combined with the nonlocal gradient corrected correlation potential by perdew and wang @xcite .",
    "the hay - wadt small - core effective core pseudopotentials ( ecp ) were adopted for ca and ti atoms @xcite .",
    "the small - core ecp s replace only the inner core orbitals , while orbitals for sub - valence electrons as well as for valence electrons are calculated self - consistently .",
    "oxygen atoms were treated with the all - electron bs .",
    "the reciprocal space integration was performed by sampling the brillouin zone of the five - atom cubic unit cell with an 8@xmath38@xmath38 pack - monkhorst grid for the bulk@xcite , and an 8@xmath38 grid for the slab structure , providing a balanced summation in direct and reciprocal spaces . to achieve high accuracy ,",
    "large enough tolerances of 7 , 8 , 7 , 7 , and 14 were chosen for the coulomb overlap , coulomb penetration , exchange overlap , first exchange pseudo - overlap , and second exchange pseudo - overlap parameters , respectively @xcite .",
    "the catio@xmath0 ( 001 ) surfaces were modeled with two - dimensional slabs consisting of several planes perpendicular to the [ 001 ] crystal direction . to simulate catio@xmath0 ( 001 ) surfaces , we used slabs consisting of seven alternating tio@xmath1 and cao layers , with mirror symmetry preserved relative to the central layer .",

    ", a simple cleavage would create a negatively - charged o - o surface and a positively - charged catio surface , leading either to an infinite macroscopic dipole moment perpendicular to the surface for a stoichiometric slab terminated by planes of different kinds ( o@xmath1 and catio ) as in fig .",

    "charge redistributions near the surface arising during the self - consistent field procedure could , in principle , compensate at least partially for these effects .",
    "however , previous careful studies for srtio@xmath0 @xcite have demonstrated that the resulting surfaces have a high energy , and that the introduction of surface vacancies provides an energetically less expensive mechanism for compensating the surfaces .    for these reasons",

    "@xcite this room - temperature ground state has a 20-atom unit cell and is a slight modification from the ideal perovskite structure involving a pattern of tilts of the tio@xmath16 octahedra according to the @xmath19 pattern in glazer s notation @xcite .",
    "the octahedral tilts have also been studied using first - principles calculations @xcite . because these tilts are substantial ( @xmath1810@xmath20 @xcite )",
    ", it is possible that they may have some impact on the surface structure and energetics .",
    "however , we have not included octahedral tilts in the work presented here for several reasons .",
    "first , we want to compare with previous calculations , which have universally not included octahedral tilts .",
    "second , the crystal-2003 code package does not provide for efficient structural optimization as would be needed to study these tilts , and the larger surface unit cells that would be required would make the calculations impractical . but",
    "finally and most importantly , we estimate that the energy scale of the tilts ( @xmath180.1ev ) is small compared to the energy scale of the surface cleavage and relaxation energies ( a few ev ) , so that it is reasonable to neglect them in a first study .",

    "however , the inward relaxation by 16.05% of the upper - layer ca atom on the ca - terminated ( 011 ) surface is about twice as large as the inward relaxations of surface atoms obtained on the cao - terminated ( 001 ) surface .",
    "our calculated atomic displacements in the third plane from the surface for the ca , tio , and o - terminated ( 011 ) surfaces are still substantial .",
    "our calculated surface rumpling @xmath9 for the tio - terminated ( 011 ) surface is approximately 1.5 times larger than that of the cao - terminated ( 001 ) surface , and many times times larger than that of the tio@xmath1-terminated ( 001 ) surface .",
    "also , our _ ab initio _ calculations predict a compression of the interlayer distance @xmath10@xmath11 and an expansion of @xmath10@xmath12 for the tio- and o - terminated ( 011 ) surfaces .",
    "this behavior seems to be obeyed by all previous calculations of relaxations at ( 001 ) abo@xmath0 perovskite surfaces @xcite ; we can conclude that this effect may be a general rule , requiring further experimental studies and confirmation .    a comparison of our _ ab initio _",
    "b3pw calculations on the tio - terminated catio@xmath0 ( 011 ) surface with the previous _ ab initio _",
    "calculation performed by zhang et al .",
    "@xcite shows that the atomic displacement directions almost always coincide , the only exception being the small third - layer ti - atom inward relaxation of @xmath330.78% in our calculation compared with an outward one of 0.28% in theirs .",
    "the displacement magnitudes are generally comparable in the two studies , leading to an excellent agreement for the tio - terminated ( 011 ) surface rumplings ( 11.81% in our calculations vs.  12.10% in theirs ) . for the ca - terminated ( 011 ) surface , our inward relaxation magnitude of 16.05% for the upper - layer ca atom ,",
    "the largest of all atoms on all of the studied ( 011 ) terminations , is in excellent agreement with the value of 15.37% obtained in ref .",
    "this largest displacement of the surface a atom on the a - terminated ( 011 ) surface is was also obtained for the srtio@xmath0 , batio@xmath0 , pbtio@xmath0 , and bazro@xmath0 cases @xcite .",
    "just as they did for the tio - terminated ( 011 ) surface , our relaxation directions for the ca - terminated surface almost all coincide with those obtained previously @xcite , the only exception being again the displacement direction of the third - layer ti atom .",
    "we find that this atom moves slightly inwards by 0.37% , whereas the previous work obtain an outward relaxation of 0.89% @xcite .    for the o - terminated ( 011 ) surface , in most cases our calculated displacement directions are in qualitative agreement with the results of ref .",
    "[ ] . in some cases , as for example for the second layer ti and o atom displacements in the direction along the surface ,",
    "our calculated displacement magnitudes for ti ( 4.70% ) and for o ( 8.05% ) are in an excellent agreement with the corresponding results ( 4.53% and 8.06% respectively ) of zhang _",
    "et al._@xcite however , in many cases , our calculated displacement magnitude is smaller than that calculated in ref .  [ ] .",
    "most disturbingly , in three cases there are also some qualitative differences between our results and those of zhang _",
    "@xcite specifically , the second - layer ca and ti atoms move substantially inwards in our calculations , but outwards in ref .",
    "[ ] , and the third - layer o atoms move in opposite directions in the two calculations .    as for the surface energies , we find that both the cao- and tio@xmath1-terminated ( 001 ) surfaces are about equally favorable , with surface energies of 0.94 and 1.13ev respectively .",
    "these values are in excellent agreement with the corresponding values of 0.824 and 1.021ev respectively as computed by zhang _",
    "et al . _  in ref .",
    "in contrast , we see very large differences in surface energies on the ( 011 ) surfaces .",
    "our lowest - energy ( 011 ) surface is the o - terminated one at 1.86ev , with the ca - terminated surface just behind at 1.91ev , and the tio - terminated surface is very unfavorable at 3.13ev .",
    "these are all much larger , by about a factor of two or more , than for the ( 001 ) surfaces .",
    "this is the same ordering of ( 011 ) surface energies as was obtained by zhang _",
    "_ , but these authors obtained quite different values of 0.837 , 1.671 , and 2.180ev for the o- , ca- , and tio - terminated ( 011 ) surfaces , respectively.@xcite the values for the ca- and tio - terminated surface energies are only modestly smaller than ours , but the value for the o - terminated ( 011 ) surface energy presents a clear disagreement with the present work , being more than twice as small as ours .",
    "in fact , according to their work , the o - terminated ( 011 ) surface is even lower in energy than the tio@xmath1-terminated ( 001 ) surface , and about equal to that of the cao - terminated ( 001 ) surface . in this respect ,",
    "their result contrasts not only with our result for catio@xmath0 , but with all previous _ ab initio _ and shell - model calculations dealing with srtio@xmath0 , batio@xmath0 , pbtio@xmath0 , and bazro@xmath0 ( 001 ) and ( 011 ) surface energies,@xcite where the ( 001 ) surface energies are always smaller than the ( 011 ) surface energies .",
    "we do not understand the reason for this discrepancy .",
    "we have carried out test calculations of the cleavage energies of the three ( 011 ) surfaces using the pbe - gga exchange - correlation functional @xcite used by zhang _",
    "_ , but within the crystal-2003 code package , and we find cleavage energies that are only about 15 - 25% larger than theirs",
    ". the drastic difference , then , must be in the relaxation energy of the ca - terminated surface , which is @xmath331.83ev in our calculation and @xmath332.70ev in theirs .",
    "we also did a test calculation of the energy of a ca - terminated ( 011 ) slab in which the surface atoms were placed by hand at the coordinates reported for this surface in ref .",
    "[ ] , and found that the energy was even higher than the energy of the unrelaxed structure .",
    "clearly these discrepancies call for further exploration .",
    "our _ ab initio _ calculations indicate a considerable increase in the ti - o bond covalency near the tio- and o - terminated ( 011 ) surfaces , as well as the tio@xmath1-terminated ( 001 ) surface .",
    "the ti - o bond covalency at the tio - terminated ( 011 ) surface ( 0.128@xmath23 ) is much larger than that for the tio@xmath1-terminated ( 001 ) surface ( 0.114@xmath23 ) or in bulk catio@xmath0 ( 0.084@xmath23 ) .",
    "the ti - o bond populations on the tio - terminated ( 011 ) surface are much larger in the direction perpendicular to the surface than in the plane ( 0.186 vs.  0.128@xmath23 ) .",
    "our calculated increase of the ti - o bond covalency near the ( 011 ) surface , is in agreement with the resonant photoemission experiments @xcite .",
    "this should have an impact on the electronic structure of surface defects ( e.g. , @xmath36 centers @xcite ) , as well as on the adsorption and surface diffusion of atoms and small molecules relevant for catalysis .",
