    "multifragmentation has been observed in nearly all types of high energy nuclear interactions induced by hadrons , photons , and heavy ions ( see a review @xcite ) .",
    "this is an universal phenomenon occurring when a large amount of energy is deposited in a nucleus , and a hot blob of nuclear matter is formed . at low excitation energies the nuclear system can be treated as a compound nucleus @xcite , which decays later via evaporation of light particles or fission .",
    "however , at high excitation energy , or possibly , compression during the initial dynamical stage of the reaction , this matter blob will expand to the sub - saturation densities , where it becomes unstable and breaks up into many fragments .",
    "as is well known ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) multifragmentation is a fast process , with a characteristic time around 100 fm / c .",
    "nevertheless , as shown by numerous analysis of experimental data , a high degree of equilibration can be reached in these reactions , and statistical models are very suitable for description of fragment yields @xcite .",
    "we believe that taking multifragmentation into account is crucially important for correct description of fragment production in high energy reactions . on",
    "the other hand multifragmentation opens a unique possibility for investigating the phase diagram of nuclear matter at temperatures @xmath0 mev and densities around @xmath1 ( @xmath2 @xmath3 is the normal nuclear density ) .",
    "these conditions are typical for the liquid - gas coexistence region .",
    "it is interesting that similar conditions are realized in stellar matter during the supernova explosions @xcite .",
    "in the course of nuclear disintegration hot primary fragments are first formed in close vicinity to each other , and , therefore , they are still subject to coulomb and , possibly , residual nuclear interactions .",
    "it is commonly accepted that the liquid - drop description of individual nuclei is very successful in nuclear physics . however , in a multi - fragment system in the freeze - out volume the parameters of the liquid - drop model may change as compared with those for isolated nuclei .",
    "an obvious example is the reduction of the fragment coulomb energy due to the presence of other fragments .",
    "this effect can be reasonably evaluated within the wigner - seitz approximation @xcite .",
    "the coulomb interaction between the fragments can also influence the proton and neutron distributions in hot fragments @xcite .",
    "moreover , nuclear interactions parameterized as bulk , surface and symmetry energy terms in the liquid - drop description of nuclei may change too .",
    "possible modifications of surface and symmetry energies of primary fragments , and constraints from relevant experimental data , were analyzed in the previous works @xcite .",
    "it was found that the symmetry energy of hot fragments drops significantly in the freeze - out volume , and the surface energy can be considerably modified at high temperatures . in this paper",
    "we investigate possible changes of the nuclear bulk energy in primary fragments , and how this may affect their production in multifragmentation reactions .",
    "we will show that these effects may be quite essential for explaining some key observables , and they should be included in realistic models .",
    "all dynamical models used for description of the initial stage of the reaction lead to the conclusion that after a time interval of few tens fm / c , when fast particles leave the system , the evolution of the remaining nuclear system changes its character . because of intensive interactions between nucleons the system evolves toward statistical equilibrium . at later times",
    "the hot nuclear residue expands and breaks - up into hot primary fragments . the statistical multifragmentation model ( smm ) is based on the assumption of statistical equilibrium between produced fragments in a low - density freeze - out volume @xcite .",
    "we believe that at this point the chemical equilibrium is established , i.e. , the baryon composition ( mass and charge ) of primary fragments is fixed .",
    "however , the fragments can still interact with other nuclear species via the coulomb and nuclear mean fields .",
    "hence their energies and densities may be affected by these residual interactions .",
    "all breakup channels composed of nucleons and excited fragments are considered , and the conservation of mass , charge , momentum and energy is taken into account .",
    "an advantage of the model is that the formation of a compound nucleus is included as one of the channels .",
    "this allows for a smooth transition from the decay via evaporation and fission at low excitation energies @xcite to the multifragmentation at high excitations . in the microcanonical treatment @xcite the statistical weight of the decay channel @xmath4",
    "is given by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the entropy of the system in channel @xmath4 which is a function of the excitation energy @xmath7 , mass number @xmath8 , charge @xmath9 and other global parameters of the source .",
    "after formation in the freeze - out volume , the fragments propagate independently in their mutual coulomb field and undergo secondary decays .",
    "the deexcitation of the hot primary fragments proceeds via evaporation , fission , or fermi - breakup @xcite .    in the smm light fragments with mass number @xmath10 and charge @xmath11",
    "are considered as structure - less particles ( nuclear gas ) with masses and spins taken from the nuclear tables .",
    "only translational degrees of freedom of these particles contribute to the entropy of the system .",
    "fragments with @xmath12 are treated as heated nuclear liquid drops , and their individual free energies @xmath13 are parameterized as a sum of the bulk , surface , coulomb and symmetry energy terms : @xmath14    in this standard expression @xmath15 is the bulk energy term including contribution of internal excitations controlled by the level - density parameter @xmath16 , and @xmath17  mev is the binding energy of infinite nuclear matter .",
    "@xmath18 is the surface energy term , where @xmath19  mev is the surface coefficient at @xmath20 , and @xmath21  mev is the critical temperature of infinite nuclear matter .",
    "the coulomb energy is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the coulomb parameter obtained in the wigner - seitz approximation , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the proton charge , @xmath26=1.17 fm , and the last factor describes the screening effect due to presence of other fragments .",
    "@xmath27 is the symmetry energy term , where @xmath28  mev is the symmetry energy coefficient .",
    "these parameters are taken from bethe - weizscker formula and correspond to the isolated fragments with normal nuclear density .",
    "this assumption has been proven to be quite successful in many applications .",
    "however , a realistic treatment of primary fragments in the freeze - out volume may require certain modifications of the liquid - drop parameters as indicated by experimental data .    in the grand canonical treatment of the smm @xcite , after integrating out translational degrees of freedom ,",
    "one can write the mean multiplicity of nuclear fragments with @xmath29 and @xmath30 as @xmath31 . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath32 is the ground - state degeneracy factor of species @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the nucleon thermal wavelength , and @xmath35 mev is the average nucleon mass .",
    "@xmath36 is the free volume available for the translational motion of fragments .",
    "the chemical potentials @xmath37 and @xmath38 are found from the mass and charge constraints : @xmath39    as was demonstrated by numerous comparisons of the smm with various experiments , the model describes data very well ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "this confirms that the statistical approach with liquid - drop description of individual fragments provides adequate treatment of the multifragmentation process .",
    "this also justifies the application of the statistical approach for investigating the liquid - gas phase transition in nuclear systems @xcite .      in recent years several new analyzes of experimental data with statistical models , related to the nuclear isospin in multifragmentation reactions have been performed @xcite .",
    "they conclude that modifications of the liquid - drop parameters of hot fragments produced in the freeze - out volume are needed to explain the data .",
    "it was suggested that this can happen because of a new physical environment where fragments are formed , in particular , since they are surrounded by nucleons and other hot fragments .",
    "the residual interactions may lead to energy and density changes which can effectively be explained by a modification of the macroscopic nuclear parameters .",
    "the symmetry energy coefficient @xmath40 was investigated in several independent experiments @xcite , which used both the isoscaling phenomenon @xcite and isotope distributions of fragments .",
    "it is important that all experiments come to the conclusion that the coefficient @xmath40 drops from about 25 mev , known for isolated cold nuclei , down to @xmath41 mev for hot primary fragments at multifragmentation .",
    "the same results were extracted also from analysis of mean neutron content of fragments @xcite .",
    "one of the aims of future experiments is to verify this conclusion .",
    "a recent analysis of the aladin data has revealed modifications in the nuclear surface properties too @xcite . there",
    "the neutron - to - proton ( @xmath42 ) dependence of the surface energy was analyzed for different event classes corresponding to different excitation energies . at low excitation energies , corresponding to the onset of multifragmentation , the surface energy follows the trend predicted by the standard liquid - drop model , i.e. , it decreases with @xmath42 .",
    "this trend is usually explained by the contribution of the surface part of the symmetry energy . in the region of developed multifragmentation ( temperatures @xmath4356 mev ) , where intermediate - mass fragments ( imf : @xmath44 ) are mostly produced",
    ", the surface energy coefficient becomes nearly independent of the @xmath42 ratio .",
    "taking into account this result we conclude that subdivision of the total symmetry energy into volume and surface parts becomes irrelevant at multifragmentation conditions .",
    "we point out also that similar conclusions about changing surface properties of nuclei were obtained within the dynamical amd model @xcite .",
    "therefore , the observed decrease of the symmetry energy of fragments should not be related to the increase of the total surface of fragments at multifragmentation .",
    "it is more likely that this is an indication of the medium modification of @xmath40 coefficient in the system of many fragments .",
    "we should point out that there are attempts to explain the isospin related observables within the mean - field models , as a result of reduced mean density of the excited nuclear system @xcite .",
    "as is well known , the corresponding equations of state predict decreasing symmetry energy at subnuclear densities .",
    "however , within this approach the fragment formation is not considered , and it is assumed that the produced fragments keep a `` memory '' about symmetry energy of a low - density system . in our opinion",
    "this assumption is not very convincing , since the fragment formation process ( e.g. , associated with the liquid - gas phase transition ) may drastically change properties of the system , and especially properties of primary fragments .",
    "we believe that it is more reasonable to assume that primary fragments produced in an expanded freeze - out volume have a reduced density , and this can lead to reduction of their symmetry energy observed in the experiments @xcite .",
    "until now the nucleon density of individual fragments was not explicitly considered in the smm calculations , and , on default , it was assumed that all fragments have normal nuclear density @xmath45 .",
    "however , as a result of residual interaction between the fragments and their thermal expansion the density of fragments ( @xmath46 ) may in fact become smaller than @xmath45 .",
    "this will lead to a reduction of the bulk binding energy @xmath47 .",
    "for estimation of this effect we use the following expression for the bulk energy as a function of the nucleon density : @xmath48 where @xmath49 mev is the nuclear compressibility modulus .",
    "there are natural limits for possible reduction of the average density of fragments . due to the spinodal instabilities and coulomb fluctuations at the subnuclear densities",
    "@xmath50 , uniform nuclear matter becomes unstable , and the nuclear `` pasta '' phases are produced @xcite . by this reason ,",
    "we take @xmath51 as the minimum possible nuclear density in individual fragments .",
    "one can see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : wrho ] ) , that this corresponds to decreasing @xmath47 from 16 mev at @xmath52 down to @xmath53 mev . in the following analysis",
    "we allow for even smaller @xmath47 , in order to perform a complete investigation of this effect .    at the last stage of the multifragmentation process",
    "hot primary fragments undergo deexcitation and propagate in the mutual coulomb field .",
    "as was demonstrated in many works ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) this stage is very important for correct calculations of final yields of fragments . in the beginning of the deexcitation",
    "the hot fragments are still surrounded by other species , and , therefore , their modified properties should be taken into account . as far as we know ,",
    "only one evaporation code was designed , which takes into account the modified properties of fragments in their de - excitation .",
    "it was developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , where modifications of symmetry energy were explicitly considered . in the present analysis we use the same prescription .",
    "namely , we start from the modified bulk energies of hot nuclei and restore their normal properties by the end of the evaporation cascade . in actual calculations",
    "we have used a simple interpolation between these two limiting states .",
    "the energy and momentum conservation laws were fulfilled in the course of this evaporation process .",
    "we emphasize that the treatment of this de - excitation stage should be consistent with the physical properties of primary fragments .",
    "for example , a failure to describe the experimental isoscaling data @xcite , by using a dynamical model for primary fragment formation , may be related to the fact that the sequential evaporation from primary fragments was included without paying attention to their reduced densities and , consequently , to their lower symmetry energies . as was demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite , this effect can influence essentially the observed isotope distributions , since separation energies of neutrons and protons are changed when compared to the isolated low - excited nuclei .",
    "the transition to the secondary de - excitation can be consistently controlled in statistical description of fragment formation , by using a generalized evaporation prescription @xcite .",
    "moreover , we think that the final conclusions about properties of primary fragments can be obtained only after a many - component analysis of experimental data . besides the isotope information and isoscaling observable this should include the corresponding fragment charge distributions , imf multiplicities , temperatures , and the other relevant characteristics ( examples of such an approach are presented in refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we have used the smm to simulate multifragmentation of the gold source with excitation energies in the range of 212 mev per nucleon at different values of the bulk energy coefficient @xmath47 . for simplicity",
    ", we fix the freeze - out density at @xmath54 as was done also in many previous smm studies . in figure 1",
    "we show some characteristics of the hot fragments : effective temperatures , mass number of the largest fragment , average multiplicity of imfs produced in the freeze - out volume .",
    "the effective temperature @xmath55 is calculated from the energy balance in the system , in the same way as it was done in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one can see that decreasing the bulk energy does not change qualitatively the general picture of multifragmentation .",
    "nevertheless , some new important features appear .",
    "for example , the back - bending of the caloric curve become more pronounced , i.e. , multifragmentation reactions become more endothermic . such behavior of @xmath55",
    "can be interpreted as a manifestation of the negative heat capacity .",
    "an interesting result is that the number of imfs and the mass of large fragments at freeze - out become smaller , while the number of light particles ( fig .",
    "2 ) is increased considerably . from fig .  2",
    "one can see a drastic rise of the yields of @xmath56-particles and clusters with @xmath57 at reduced @xmath47 .",
    "the reason is that we take into account fragments with @xmath58 as gas particles with their table binding energies , while binding energies of other fragments become smaller .",
    "we believe that @xmath56-particles have normal properties in the low density freeze - out volume .",
    "this assumption is consistent with many experimental data .",
    "for example , by interpretation of fragment yields in direct knock - out reactions on nuclei , @xmath56- clusters are assumed to pre - exist even at the normal nuclear density , which is much higher than the freeze - out density at multifragmentation @xcite .",
    "we suggest that this effect may explain an excess of @xmath56- particle yields over smm predictions observed in emulsion data @xcite .",
    "it is important that all new trends in the fragment yields caused by changing the bulk energy survive after the secondary deexcitation .",
    "figs . 3 and 4",
    "show the final yields of cold fragments .",
    "the number of emitted @xmath56- particles even increases , since their evaporation becomes more probable at the first stages of deexcitation , in addition to the increased production at the break - up of the source ( see fig .  4 )",
    "this fact leads to the decrease of the so - called he  li temperature ( see fig .  3 ) , which is one of the useful experimental observable for the calorimetry of multifragmentation processes @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "decreasing @xmath47 causes a drop of neutron and proton yields , since they are now bound in the light clusters . for the same reason ,",
    "the maximum imf multiplicity becomes lower .    in order to give a detailed picture of nuclear break - up , in figs .",
    "5 and 6 we present the distributions of produced fragments in the full mass range , before and after the secondary deexcitation .",
    "we choose the range of excitation energies where the transition from the u - shaped to the power - law distributions is taking place .",
    "it is obvious that decreasing the bulk energy favours multifragmentation , since less bound largest clusters are destroyed in favor of light clusters and nucleons .",
    "however , the yields of imfs in this crucial region change very little with @xmath47 ( as one can also see from figs . 1 and 3 ) , and the general shape of the imf distributions does not change . by using a well - known power - law parametrization @xmath59 of imf yields",
    "we obtain that the @xmath60 remains practically the same for the considered variations of @xmath47 .",
    "this result is quite understandable : since the @xmath47 parameter enters binding energies of all imf , their relative yields do not change .",
    "for this reason , the previously reported results concerning evolution of the isospin - dependent contribution to the surface energy with excitation energy of the system @xcite , which are based on consideration of the imf yields , remain valid in the case of reduced bulk energy too .",
    "much attention is now paid to the isotope production in multifragmentation reactions , because of its connection to properties of neutron - rich nuclear matter and to astrophysical applications @xcite .",
    "we have investigated this problem , and fig .",
    "7 demonstrates isotope distributions of fragments with @xmath61 before ( in the freeze - out volume ) and after the secondary deexcitation ( at infinity ) . at smaller bulk energies",
    "the hot fragments become a little bit more neutron rich .",
    "this is explained by enhanced production of the symmetric @xmath56 clusters , leading to a neutron enrichment of the remaining nuclear matter .",
    "however , this trend is more evident for the cold fragments , and we have two contributions to this effect .",
    "the first one is caused by the considerable probability of @xmath56 particles emission in the beginning of the evaporation cascade , due to the modified bulk energy of heavier nuclei .",
    "the second one is related to the fact that the initial temperature is lower , and , therefore , the evaporational evolution of nuclei towards the @xmath62-stability line is ceased at relatively large neutron excess .",
    "this possibility for obtaining neutron - rich isotopes should be considered in future analyzes of data alongside with possible reduction of the symmetry energy of fragments @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", these two possibilities may complement each other , since an expansion ( i.e. , a reduced density ) of hot fragments should lead to decreasing their symmetry energy too @xcite . the bulk symmetry energy as a function of density is usually parameterized as @xmath63 where the exponent @xmath64 ranges between 0.5 and 1.5 depending on the model assumptions on isospin - dependent nuclear interactions .",
    "recent analyses of experimental data have shown that around @xmath65 the values of @xmath64 may lie in the interval between 0.7 @xcite and 0.9 @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to explain a considerable drop of 40% in @xmath40 , which fits experimental observations , we need to decrease @xmath66 to @xmath67 . as we have noted previously , this is already lower than the threshold for appearance of different `` pasta '' phases @xcite .",
    "also , the realistic hartree  fock and thomas  fermi calculations for hot isolated compound nuclei predict a rather moderate expansion at temperatures of 5  6 mev , not more than 10 ",
    "20% @xcite , depending on the nuclear forces used .",
    "therefore , the maximum reduction of the fragment density , which can be approximately considered , is around 3040% . in this situation",
    "one should find additional mechanisms to explain the observed modification of the symmetry energy .",
    "in this paper we proceed further with the investigation of possible modifications of nuclear properties in surrounding of other nuclei , which can still interact with nuclear and electromagnetic forces .",
    "this subject is relevant for nuclear matter at low density , which breaks - up into fragments .",
    "this state of matter can also be considered as a mixed phase of the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition .",
    "it is expected that this transition takes place in such astrophysical processes as collapses of massive stars and supernova explosions . in terrestrial laboratories",
    "this physical phenomenon can experimentally be studied in multifragmentation reactions induced by hadrons and heavy ions of intermediate energies .",
    "actually , the multifragmentation is a unique tool , which extends our conventional study of isolated compound nuclei to the nuclei embedded in the environment of many nuclear species .    in recent years",
    "interesting new analyzes of multifragmentation data have appeared which indicate a significant modification of properties of nuclei in such a medium .",
    "they include : decrease of the symmetry energy of nuclei , disappearance of an isospin - dependent contribution to the surface energy , and possible expansion of hot nuclei . in the present work we have investigated the influence of decreasing bulk energy on the fragment production .",
    "we have found that this effect should lead to an enhanced production of @xmath56 clusters . in the case of a neutron - rich system",
    ", this should result in larger neutron richness of heavy fragments .",
    "another important finding is that , despite of disintegration of the system into larger number of fragments , the shape of the imf mass distributions does not change with decreasing bulk energy .",
    "also we have found a moderate modification of the caloric curve , namely a more pronounced back - bending , which indicates a negative heat capacity , and a drop of the apparent helium - lithium temperature .",
    "it is important that all findings are consistent with previous results on modification of fragment properties extracted from experimental data .",
    "moreover , the expansion of hot fragments may provide an additional contribution to some effects observed earlier , such as decrease of their symmetry energy , and increase of neutron richness of cold fragments .",
    "we foresee new analyzes of experimental data in order to clarify contributions of different mechanisms leading to the modification of fragment properties in multi - particle environment .",
