    "at the present generation b - factories lepton pair production , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , occurs at approximately the same rate as the @xmath5 process . given the high statistics of the available data , precise knowledge of the -pair and -pair production cross sections in annihilations at a center - of - mass energy  = 10.58 @xmath2is necessary for a number of precision measurements , particularly for measurements of the branching fractions of @xmath6 decays and luminosity determinations using the counting of @xmath1 events .",
    "the belle experiment currently uses a @xmath6-pair cross section of 0.89  nb and quotes a 1.4% error on the number of @xmath6-pairs produced for a given amount of integrated luminosity where the 1.4% is intended to account mainly for the luminosity measurement error  @xcite .",
    "the  experiment also uses a 0.89  nb cross section but assigns a 2% error to this figure based on a simple comparison of the cross sections from the  @xcite and  @xcite monte carlo simulation programs  @xcite .",
    "although the 2% figure is adequate in searches for rare or forbidden processes , such a large error currently limits the precision of @xmath6 branching fraction measurements at the b - factories electronic branching fraction which is measured to @xmath7 accuracy , as has been done in a recent publication  @xcite .",
    "however , in such an approach , the corresponding monte carlo generators , e.g.  @xcite , would need to be tested at the precision of 0.1% level in the presence of experimental cuts , and such a study is beyond the scope of the present paper . ] .    in principle , the cross sections determined with are the most precise calculations currently available , but the cross sections and their precisions as determined with this code at energies far below the @xmath8-pole have not been reported .",
    "only tests for @xmath9 have been available in the literature  @xcite and the code cautions users of its potential lack of reliability for energies below @xmath10 because of insufficient study in that regime .    this unsatisfactory situation should be compared with predictions of for high energies , where a precision at the 0.1 - 0.4% level was achieved  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report on straightforward studies of the @xmath11 and @xmath6 pair production cross - section calculations of and at  = 10.58 @xmath2with a goal of providing , for the first time , a realistic estimate of the precision of the cross - section calculation at energies relevant to the b - factories relying on , but not repeating , the detailed high energy investigations .",
    "the cross sections are calculated using code that includes qed and electroweak radiative corrections to different orders in the fine structure constant @xmath12 and using different approximations for vacuum polarization .",
    "calculates the matrix element to order @xmath12 including interference between initial ( isr ) and final state radiation ( fsr ) . calculates the cross section to order @xmath13 and includes exponentiation and isr - fsr interference .",
    "various implementations of the vacuum polarization can be used in both and programs .",
    "the results presented here rely on the extensive studies  @xcite used to determine the precision of the calculations in the as well as koralz  @xcite software .",
    "the conclusion of those studies is that cross sections calculated with at the @xmath8-pole and lep  ii energies ( @xmath14 ) are at the precision level of 0.2% .",
    "fortunately , the physics environment at the higher energies where the detailed tests have been made is far more complex than at the @xmath15 .",
    "for example , unlike at the @xmath15 , the higher energy tests had to address issues related to the radiative return to the @xmath8-pole , including effects related to initial and final state radiation bremsstrahlung interference ; scattering - angle dependencies , of particular interest because of the importance of forward - backward asymmetry measurements at the higher energies ; and high - energy electroweak and qcd corrections .",
    "therefore it is only necessary to verify that the technical precision determined in detail at the higher energies for a wide class of effects can be reliably extended to the lower energies of the b - factories .",
    "this has been accomplished using relatively simple tests . in this way",
    "we achieve the goal of providing a realistic cross - section error without having to repeat the previous high energy studies . however , because of the different energy scales , the high energy studies of several effects , such as the vacuum polarization , are not reliably extended to the @xmath15 , and these have been examined separately .",
    "as it turns out , our current knowledge of the lepton pair production cross sections is in fact partially limited by the treatment of vacuum polarization in this calculation . in this paper",
    ", we study their contributions using different parameterizations of the hadronic part of the vacuum polarization , as well as our knowledge of the ratio @xmath16 .",
    "other sources of theoretical uncertainty arise from the implementation of initial and final state radiation including their interference and electroweak corrections , effects from virtual pair - productions of additional fermions , and the impact of low - energy resonances on the cross section .    at the level of precision targeted in this work , cross sections for -pair and -pair processes are adequately studied with 10@xmath17 generated events . because of the larger contribution from radiative returns to very low energy in -pair events , cross sections are also studied with an angular acceptance in the center - of - mass for both muons of @xmath18 $ ] and with effective center - of - mass energy , @xmath19 , greater than 10% of 10.58 gev which corresponds more closely to the actual experimental acceptance .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section  [ vacpol ]",
    "we discuss radiative corrections to the total cross section due to hadronic vacuum polarization .",
    "we have found that changes to the public versions of the two programs are necessary in order to achieve the goal of obtaining a reduced systematic error .",
    "section  [ isrfsr ] is devoted to verifying that the high energy estimates of the systematic error of photonic ( and acceptance dependent ) corrections for the total cross section remain valid at our energies as well .",
    "sections  [ interfer ] and  [ pairproduction ] discuss the impact of interference and pair production corrections , respectively .",
    "section  [ resonances ] describes how we address the effects of vector resonances .",
    "section  [ ratio ] discusses the error on the ratio of the and cross sections as calculated by .",
    "the estimations of the systematic error of theoretical predictions for the @xmath6-pair and @xmath11-pair cross sections are summarized in section  [ summary ] .",
    "the particular vacuum polarization implementation is controlled in the code using the ihvp flag following the dizet implementation of the calculation  @xcite , with improvements summarized in section 4.1.3 of ref .",
    "@xcite and section 4.132 of ref .",
    "the default modeling of vacuum polarization in corresponding to ihvp flag = 1  @xcite , suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite was not optimized for the low energy applications . in the present implementation",
    ", the hadronic part of the vacuum polarization is studied using the experimental knowledge of the ratio @xmath20 relevant for a precise determination of @xmath21 .",
    "the hadronic part of the vacuum polarization is not calculated in this option in dizet for center - of - mass energies less than 40  @xmath2 .",
    "thus , at = 10.58  @xmath2 , this option gives a @xmath22 lower fermion - pair cross section than those obtained from other dizet options that include the hadronic component of the vacuum polarization .",
    "other available options in dizet ( ihvp flag = 2  @xcite and = 3  @xcite ) use experimental knowledge of the ratio @xmath16 measured more than 15 years ago .",
    "improvements in the measurements of the ratio @xmath23 from the crystal ball experiment  @xcite in annihilations at @xmath24 between 5.0 and 7.4  @xmath2 , and more recent measurements by the bes experiment  @xcite at @xmath24 between 2 and 5  @xmath2 , are not included for these options .",
    "improvements on the calculation of the hadronic part of the vacuum polarization at @xmath25 obtained by including these new measurements of @xmath23 have been documented recently  @xcite . following these developments ,",
    "we have introduced a new option in dizet implemented with ihvp flag = 4 to calculate the contribution of vacuum polarization using the routine `` repi ''",
    "@xcite , where these improvements on the measurement of @xmath23 have been incorporated .",
    "we evalute the uncertainties associated with using ihvp flag = 4 .",
    "the routine repi uses a simple parametrization of the hadronic contribution to the vacuum polarization in the @xmath26-channel and can be used safely in the @xmath27-channel outside the energy regime dominated by individual resonances .",
    "special care must be taken to account for the large positive and negative fluctuations in the contribution to the hadronic part of the vacuum polarization in the @xmath27-channel across the resonance as illustrated in fig .  1 of ref .",
    "we have calculated the differences between the @xmath27-channel and @xmath26-channel contribution of the hadronic part of the vacuum polarization to the and -pair production cross section , weighted by the distribution of the invariant mass of the lepton - pair system ( ) in bins of 10  @xmath28 . below and above the resonances , these differences are positive and negative , respectively , and their effects tend to cancel when integrated over . at the @xmath15",
    "these differences cancel partially , and the size of this cancelation is sensitive to the variation of the central value of the center - of - mass energy distribution of colliding beams for different periods of data taking as well as the collider beam energy spread .",
    "we assume a beam energy spread of 4.6  @xmath28(rms ) , which is characteristic of the center - of - mass energy spread at  experiment at the pep  ii b - factory  @xcite .",
    "based on the results of these calculations we assign an uncertainty of 0.18% on the -pair cross section and 0.22% for the -pair cross section associated with the implementation of the vacuum polarization in with ihvp flag = 4 in dizet .",
    "these uncertainties are also valid for the belle experiment , since the center - of - mass energy spread of the kek b - factory is similar to that of the pep  ii b - factory  @xcite .    in order to check the technical precision of this new implementation of vacuum polarization , we have also calculated the cross section with using different ihvp options in dizet as well as with corresponding calculations using with this new ihvp flag = 4 option implemented .",
    "the cross sections for @xmath29 and @xmath30 calculated with are summarized in table  [ tab:1 ] along with their monte carlo statistical errors , which are at the level of 0.02% for -pairs and",
    "0.03% for the -pairs .",
    "the cross sections for -pairs with the cuts mentioned in the previous section are denoted with `` @xmath31 '' and `` @xmath32 '' subscripts , respectively , for the cases when only the angular acceptance cuts are applied and when both the acceptance and the @xmath33 cuts are applied . for @xmath6-pair production , we report the total cross section .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from this study it is evident that the vector meson resonances contribute at the 0.16% to the @xmath6-pair cross section and the 0.28% level to @xmath34 .",
    "we assign these as conservative uncertainties on the cross section calculation because they are not included in the code .",
    "note that if an @xmath35 cut is applied to a @xmath11-pair selection that removes the @xmath36 and @xmath37 resonances , e.g. @xmath38 , then this component of the error on @xmath34 is reduced to 0.15% , otherwise there will be an additional contribution of 0.12% from @xmath36 contribution to @xmath34 .",
    "if no cuts are applied , the error on @xmath39 from this source is 0.33% .",
    "one of the means of determining the integrated luminosity of a data set at the b - factories is to count @xmath11-pair events .",
    "if this luminosity is used to establish the number of produced @xmath6-pair events in the sample , then the ratio @xmath40/@xmath34 appears in the denominator of the branching fraction calculation . in this case",
    ", the error on this ratio contributes a theoretical systematic error associated with the overall normalization of the data sample .",
    "one can expect that some of the errors discussed in this paper will cancel in the ratio .    for the vacuum polarization uncertainty , the only component of uncertainty that survives in the ratio is associated with the contributions to @xmath39 below the threshold because above the threshold the vacuum polarization contributes to both -pairs and -pairs in the same way , apart from small effects related to the exact description of the @xmath35 dependence above the threshold .",
    "we apply the same technique for evaluating the systematic error as described in section  [ vacpol ] except we only consider the contributions up to the threshold .",
    "this yields an uncertainty of less than 0.05% .",
    "the uncertainty of the determination of the hadronic vacuum polarization from the dispersion integral varies between 0.01% and 0.02% below the threshold .",
    "these two uncertainties are independent and we assign the total uncertainty coming from the vacuum polarization in the ratio @xmath40/@xmath34 to be 0.05% .    for the treatment of initial and final state bremsstrahlung , we conservatively take as the error on the ratio the same value of 0.2% assigned for the uncertainty on the absolute cross section .",
    "almost certainly there are cancellations that further reduce this and which can be determined with additional study .",
    "similarly , we assume the interference error on the ratio to be 0.04% . however , the pair - production and vertex correction uncertainties are 100% correlated and largely cancel in the ratio . assuming the @xmath11-pair selection employed for a luminosity determination applies a cut of @xmath38 , the error associated with the resonances will also cancel in the ratio , otherwise there will be an additional error of 0.12% .",
    "the total error we assign to the ratio @xmath40/@xmath41 is @xmath42 .",
    "adding the uncertainties from the effects discussed in this paper in quadrature we conclude that calculates the -pair and -pair production cross sections at @xmath43 with a @xmath44 and @xmath45 relative calculational uncertainty , respectively . using the ihvp flag = 4 option with the program as the central values ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath46 , @xmath4 , @xmath47 and @xmath40/@xmath48 . given the approach taken here to estimate the cross - section error , it is evident that , if required , the quoted precision can be further improved in the future by undertaking a more detailed , though well - defined , analysis .",
