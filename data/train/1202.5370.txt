    "geodesic congruences ( flows ) and their features in various spacetime backgrounds have been extensively studied by mathematicians and physicists alike , over many years . in the context of gravity and general relativity , studies on the evolution ( along a chosen geodesic flow ) of the kinematical quantities ( the isotropic expansion , shear and rotation ( henceforth referred as esr ) ) in specific spacetime geometries ,",
    "have been carried out .",
    "the esr evolution , as is well  known , is governed by the raychaudhuri equations @xcite .",
    "in particular , consequences ( geodesic focusing ) of the raychaudhuri equation for the expansion scalar are crucial while proving the singularity theorems in general relativity @xcite .",
    "recently , we have initiated a programme where we intend to study geodesic flows in various contexts ( an example outside the realm of general relativity , is , deformable media ) by solving the evolution equations for the esr , in various scenarios .",
    "some of our work is available in @xcite-@xcite .    in order to push things",
    "further beyond our investigations in @xcite , here we intend to look at geodesic flows in rotating black hole spacetimes . to start with , we restrict to three dimensions , where the well - known black hole solution ( with rotation ) is the ba@xmath3ados  teitelboim  zanelli ( btz ) line element @xcite .",
    "the btz , is a solution of the three dimensional einstein equations with a negative cosmological constant .",
    "further , in four dimensions , we have the the famous kerr black hole @xcite which is also important , astrophysically .",
    "such black holes are characterised by their mass and spin ( rotation rate ) and the study of geodesic flows in their gravitational fields can provide useful information about the behaviour of matter around strong gravitational fields .",
    "studies on characterisation of geodesics around a kerr black hole , in terms of exact equatorial homoclinic orbits that separate bound orbits from plunging , and whirling from non - whirling , are available in @xcite .",
    "the potential usefulness of analysing families of black hole orbits has been alluded to in @xcite .    in this article , we aim towards understanding the kinematics of geodesic flows in the above mentioned spacetimes , in three and four dimensions . our article is organised as follows .",
    "we first review the btz spacetime along with its geodesic structure in section [ btzst ] .",
    "the raychaudhuri equations in the background of the btz black hole spacetime are then written in a freely falling fermi normal frame . surprisingly , the raychaudhuri equations in this case are analogous to those in the flat background , with stiffness @xcite identified with the modulus of the cosmological constant .",
    "the analytical solutions are discussed and the kinematics of flows is revealed accordingly in section [ btzrc ] .",
    "next , the kerr black hole spacetime geometry ( which is a vacuum , axisymmetric solution of the einstein equations ) with the associated geodesic equations is reviewed briefly in section [ 4dsbhst ] followed by the derivation of raychaudhuri equations in section [ krayeqn ] . in view of the absence of the analytical solutions of the ( geodesic and raychaudhuri ) equations for the kerr case ,",
    "we have solved them numerically .",
    "based on the evolution of esr variables for various sets of initial conditions with different values of the other parameters involved , the generic features of the geodesic flows are visualised in section [ krayeqn ] .",
    "the results are also compared with those obtained for the schwarzschild geometry .",
    "finally , in section [ conclu ] , we highlight the important results obtained and indicate the possibilities for future work .",
    "let us begin by writing down the line element for the btz black hole in @xmath4 dimensions @xcite , @xmath5 here , the squared lapse function @xmath6 and the angular shift @xmath7 are given by , @xmath8 with @xmath9 , and @xmath10 . in equation ( [ nnphi ] ) ,",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 are , respectively , the mass and angular momentum parameters of the btz black hole , while the parameter @xmath13 is the radius of curvature of the spacetime geometry , related to the cosmological constant ( @xmath14 ) as @xmath15 .",
    "the lapse function vanishes for the following two values of @xmath16 , @xmath17^{\\frac{1}{2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath18 identifies the horizons of the btz black hole , which exist only when the following conditions are satisfied , @xmath19 the inner ( @xmath20 ) and outer ( @xmath21 ) horizons shrink with the increasing value of the cosmological constant .",
    "one may also note here that both the roots of the lapse function coincide for the extremal case @xmath22 .",
    "the first integral of the geodesic equations corresponding to the line element ( [ btzmetric ] ) are given as follows @xcite , @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25^{\\frac{1}{2 } } , \\label{rdot}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are integration constants which represent the energy and angular momentum , respectively . here",
    "@xmath28 satisfies the timelike constraint @xmath29 for the timelike geodesics .",
    "the equations ( [ tdot])-([rdot ] ) characterise the motion of the test particles in the btz black hole spacetime .",
    "we construct an orthonormal fermi frame with @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) where @xmath32 this is the local inertial frame of a freely falling observer . the basis set @xmath33 is parallely transported along the geodesic .",
    "the tensor @xmath34 , defined in the coordinate frame , may be rewritten in the local frame of the freely falling observer as @xmath35 .",
    "further , @xmath36 can be decomposed into its trace , symmetric traceless and antisymmetric parts in the usual way , @xmath37 where , @xmath38 in the above , @xmath39 is the expansion scalar , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the components of trace  free shear tensor @xmath42 while @xmath43 denotes the component of rotation in the antisymmetric tensor @xmath44 .",
    "the evolution equation for @xmath45 in the fermi normal frame as discussed above is then given as , @xmath46 since we are working in three dimensions , we can make use of the following relation between the riemann , ricci tensors and the ricci scalar , @xmath47 and also the relation @xmath48 . consequently , the equation for @xmath49 becomes @xmath50 using ( [ bdecom ] ) , and ( [ bevol ] ) , the raychaudhuri equations for the esr variables turn out to be , @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 the above first ",
    "order , coupled , nonlinear and inhomogeneous ordinary differenial equations have to be solved , for given initial conditions , in order to obtain the kinematical evolution of the esr along geodesic congruences .",
    "a subtle point may be noted here . given the ( static ) velocity vector field @xmath55 in ( [ tdot])-([rdot ] ) one can easily find the esr variables as functions of @xmath16 using the definition @xmath56 .",
    "this leads to , for example , @xmath57^{1/2 } } , \\label{thdirect}\\ ] ] and the vorticity @xmath58 .",
    "physically , this represents the kinematics of a geodesic congruence in which all geodesics have a fixed value of the constants @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , this expression can not accommodate arbitrary initial conditions on the velocity field of a congruence , or on the esr variables .",
    "the solutions obtained by integrating the raychaudhuri equations ( [ theta])-([omega ] ) directly , for given arbitrary initial conditions , are , in this sense more general , and thereby , underscores the importance of these equations .",
    "the equations ( [ theta])-([omega ] ) have been exactly solved analytically ( see @xcite for the detailed procedure ) .",
    "it is interesting to note from equations ( [ theta])-([omega ] ) here and ( 2.8)-(2.11 ) in @xcite that , kinematically , the equations in the btz black hole background can be mapped to those for flows in a flat space with isotropic stiffness @xmath59 ( @xmath60 in @xcite ) . in order to solve this set of equations ,",
    "we first define a parameter @xmath61 and obtain the following analytical expressions for the esr for the three different cases depending on the signature of @xmath62 .",

    "we observe the effect of rotation on the expansion scalar @xmath0 in fig.[fig1btz ] .",
    "the corresponding orbits are presented in fig.[fig2btz ] ( without initial rotation ) and fig.[fig3btz ] ( with initial rotation ) .",
    "it is observed that the geodesic congruence is necessarily singular without initial rotation ( see fig.[fig1btz ] ) , a fact which can also be inferred from the analytical solutions .",
    "geodesic focusing always occurs earlier with the shrinking of the horizon of the btz black hole , due to an increase in the value of @xmath97 , as shown in fig.[fig1btz](i ) . however beyond a critical value of the initial rotation , the congruence singularity",
    "is removed irrespective of the presence / absence of the horizon , as shown in fig.[fig1btz](ii ) .",
    "it may be noted that the fig.[fig1btz](i ) corresponds to the exact solutions of the esr variables represented by equations ( [ thetaigreaterzero ] ) and ( [ common ] ) for the case @xmath63 .",
    "further , fig.[fig1btz](ii ) corresponds to the exact solutions of the esr variables represented by equations ( [ thetailesszero ] ) and ( [ common1 ] ) for the case @xmath82 .",
    "it might seem that the expression for @xmath0 in ( [ thdirect ] ) does have a dependence on the parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 @xmath26 , @xmath27 among others .",
    "however , one can show using the solutions of the geodesic equations ( i.e. , @xmath98 ) in ( [ thdirect ] ) that the final result coincides with one of the solutions obtained above in this section .",
    "thus , it is surprising to note that , while the geodesic trajectories depend on the parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 , etc .",
    ", the esr variables depend only on @xmath97 .",
    "this is essentially an effect of the spacetime dimension ( @xmath99 here ) where the weyl tensor is identically zero and no explicit dependence on @xmath11 , @xmath12 appear in the esr evolution equations .",
    "in this section , we quickly recall the well - known kerr black hole spacetime ( in the boyer  lindquist coordinates , which are analogous to the schwarzschild coordinates for a non  rotating black hole ) with mass @xmath11 and angular momentum @xmath12 as characterised by the following stationary and axisymmetric metric , @xmath100 here @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 . with @xmath104 ,",
    "the kerr metric ( [ kerrmetric ] ) reduces to the schwarzschild .",
    "the geodesic equations corresponding to the metric ( [ kerrmetric ] ) are well  known ( we do not repeat them here )",
    ". however , analytical expressions of first integrals of the geodesic equations are not known for the general case ( except for the choice of @xmath105 @xcite ) . in our work here , we are interested in timelike geodesic congruences for which the constraint @xmath106 is satisfied , i.e. , @xmath107 once the initial conditions on the velocity vector components are specified in such a way that this constraint is satisfied , it will be satisfied throughout the geodesic evolution .",
    "consider a congruence of geodesics with the associated time like vector field @xmath108 , tangent to the geodesic at each point and satisfying equation ( [ tlc ] ) .",
    "a transverse metric @xmath109 on a spacelike hypersurface can be written by decomposing the spacetime metric @xmath110 as defined through equation ( [ kerrmetric ] ) into the longitudinal ( @xmath111 ) and transverse part ( i.e. , @xmath112 , @xmath113 the transverse metric satisfies @xmath114 which means that @xmath109 is orthogonal to @xmath115 and the transverse spacelike hypersurface represents the local rest frame of a freely falling observer in the given spacetime",
    ". the evolution of the esr on such a transverse hypersurface , can be investigated by using a tensor @xmath45 , which can be decomposed into its trace , symmetric traceless and antisymmetric parts as follows , @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the expansion scalar , @xmath118 the shear tensor , and @xmath119}$ ] , the rotation tensor with the brackets @xmath120 and @xmath121 $ ] denoting symmetrisation and antisymmetrisation , respectively .",
    "the shear and rotation tensors also satisfy @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "the evolution equation for @xmath45 takes the following form , @xmath124 using the equation ( [ dotb1 ] ) and following standard methods @xcite , the raychaudhuri equations for the esr variables in the kerr black hole spacetime , given by equation ( [ kerrmetric ] ) turn out to be , @xmath125 @xmath126 @xmath127 where @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 is the weyl tensor for the present case .",
    "one can notice the absence of the geometric part ( i.e. , @xmath131 ) in equation ( [ theta3e ] ) since the kerr spacetime is ricci flat .",
    "further , the nonzero weyl in equation ( 5.5 ) , with its dependence on the rotation parameter @xmath2 ( and also @xmath11 ) will lead to a dependence on @xmath2 in the evolution of the esr .      in the absence of analytical solutions for the esr variables in this case , we have directly solved ( [ dotb1 ] ) numerically . in order to represent these kinematical quantities at any point",
    ", we consider a freely falling ( fermi ) normal frame with the basis vectors @xmath132 , @xmath133 ( with @xmath134 ) which are parallely transported . to construct such frames numerically , we solve the differential equations @xmath135 ( with initial conditions of an orthonormal frame ) simultaneously with ( [ dotb1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "the tensor @xmath45 in the fermi basis may be represented as , @xmath136 @xmath137 where @xmath138 are co - frame basis which satisfy the relation @xmath139 .",

    "we consider the case when @xmath105 ( equatorial section ) .",
    "we have observed that for an initially expanding congruence , geodesic defocusing takes place ( i.e. , @xmath166 and there exists a critical value of the expansion scalar @xmath167 below which there is a focusing ( i.e. , @xmath168 .",
    "it is important to mention that with the change in the initial conditions on shear and rotation , the critical value of the initial expansion scalar will also change .",
    "the results with no initial shear and rotation are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig1](i ) and ( ii ) for @xmath169 above the critical initial expansion ( defocusing ) , and figs .",
    "[ fig2](i ) and ( ii ) for @xmath169 below the critical initial expansion ( focusing ) for both kerr and schwarzschild ( @xmath104 ) black holes .",
    "in order to see the effects of the angular momentum @xmath2 and the initial rotation @xmath1 of the congruence , we have calculated the time to singularity @xmath163 for the super - critical and sub - critical values of @xmath169 and presented them , respectively , in figs . [ fig1](iii ) and ( iv ) , and figs .",
    "[ fig2](iii ) and ( iv ) . for the case in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we observe that both angular momentum and initial rotation of the congruence assist defocusing . on the other hand in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , it is observed that with increase in @xmath1 , the congruence focuses at a later instant , as expected , while an opposite trend is observed for increase in @xmath2 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the angular momentum @xmath2 advances the time to singularity ( irrespective of its type ) , while the initial rotation @xmath1 of the congruence advances defocusing and delays focusing . for this reason , for the same set of initial conditions ,",
    "focusing / defocusing occurs earlier in the kerr black hole as compared to the schwarzschild .",
    "we have also noticed that the effect of initial shear on geodesic focusing and defocusing for the kerr case is the same as that for the schwarzschild ( results are not presented here ) .",
    "focusing occurs at an earlier instant of time when we have some initial shear in comparison to the case with zero initial shear .",
    "since all values of @xmath11 and @xmath2 do not correspond to a kerr black hole and the horizon exists only when @xmath170 , the limiting value of the angular momentum is @xmath171 ( extreme kerr ) .",
    "we have observed that for the extreme kerr , all the features of the geodesic focusing and defocusing remain qualitatively similar as those for the non  extreme kerr case , though with a change in the scale .",
    "in this article , we have investigated the kinematics of of timelike geodesic congruences in the background of the btz and kerr black hole spacetimes .",
    "the important conclusions are summarised below :    * apart from the cosmological constant ( @xmath14 ) , the other parameters of the btz black hole spacetime , do not have any direct role in the kinematics of the geodesic congruence .",
    "however , the geodesic trajectories surely depend on the black hole parameters . *",
    "an increase in @xmath14 in the btz case , which implies a larger negative curvature , enhances focusing of the congruence .",
    "* the notion of focusing remains qualitatively similar in the btz black hole background for the cases with or without horizons .",
    "*   the angular momentum paramter @xmath2 of the kerr black hole assists both focusing and defocusing when the respective cases occur .",
    "thus , physically , the larger the spin of the black hole , the earlier the focusing / defocusing of the geodesic congruence occurs .",
    "this effect is absent in the btz black hole case . * in contrast with the role of @xmath2 , an increase in the initial rotation , @xmath1 , of the congruence assists defocusing but delays focusing in both the @xmath4 and @xmath172 dimensional rotating black holes .",
    "this observation is similar to results obtained previously @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the tidal distortion due to the presence of mass nearby , or accretion of matter into a rotating black hole deserves careful attention .",
    "the kinematics of inflows can be conveniently studied using the raychaudhuri equations in these backgrounds .",
    "the effect of the black hole angular momentum parameter on the focussing / defocussing of geodesic congruences , as has been observed in this work , can have an interesting role in the accreation process and may produce observable effects .",
    "further , for a more comprehensive understanding , the kinematics of flows in maximally extended coordinate systems , for black hole spacetimes , would be interesting to investigate .",
    "finally , the study of kinematics of null geodesic flows in such spacetimes is surely worth trying out in future .",
