    "in order to explain the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) observables at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) having temperature ( @xmath8 ) @xmath9k , it has become apparent that a non - zero shear viscosity , @xmath0 , is needed .",
    "one way of characterizing @xmath0 , which is a dimensionful number , is to take its ratio with the entropy density , @xmath1 .",
    "it turns out that rhic plasma has [ ebs ] ~0.1 .",
    "although @xmath0 itself is large ( in cgs units @xmath10 gm / cm / s ) , its ratio with @xmath1 is small . note that this ratio for a known fluid , say water , is about two orders of magnitude greater than the above value .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations at rhic and large hadron collider ( lhc ) ( which provide the environments created around a few microseconds after the big bang ) as well suggest a small value for this ratio in the hot qgp state .",
    "such a small value points towards strongly interacting matter .",
    "string theory arguments and the famous gauge / gravity duality in the form of the ads / cft correspondence suggest a lower bound @xcite for @xmath6 for any matter given by ~0.08 , [ etabys ] where @xmath11 @xcite but non - zero @xcite ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for the present purpose",
    ", we assume that there is a bound and that @xmath12 .",
    "is there any natural site revealing an @xmath6 close to above lower bound ?",
    "note that evenif @xmath13 , still the same question remains .",
    "such a value may be possible to arise naturally , if the temperature and/or density of the systems are / is same as that in rhic / lhc . in the search of such an exotic system ,",
    "our story starts which could serve as a natural verification of gauge / gravity duality in the form of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "observed data suggest that the accretion flows around certain black holes must be optically thin , geometrically thick and very hot",
    ". such flows often exhibit outflows / jets in their hard spectral states .",
    "the ion temperature ( @xmath14 ) in such flows / disks is as high as @xmath15k . the supermassive black hole system at the centre of our galaxy , sgr  a@xmath16 @xcite , ( most of the temporal classes of ) the x - ray binary cyg  x-1 @xcite are some of the examples of this kind of hot accretion disks , which exhibit radiatively inefficient flows .",
    "they are particularly different from their radiatively efficient counter part , namely the keplerian accretion disk , which is geometrically thin , optically thick , cooler , and of temperature @xmath17k @xcite .",
    "the flow in certain temporal classes ( and soft spectral states ) of micro - quasar grs  1915 + 105 @xcite is an example of keplerian disk . while the temperature of the latter cases could be same order in magnitude as that in the center of a star , due to much low density they practically do not exhibit any thermonuclear burning .",
    "hence any source of energy therein must be due to magnetic and viscous effects .",
    "on the other hand , the former cases may be favourable for thermonuclear reactions due to their very high temperature , evenif their density is low @xcite .",
    "hence , the energy released / absorbed due to nuclear reactions in an optically thin , hot , accretion flow could be comparable to or even dominating over its viscous counter part @xcite .",
    "being very hot , such flows are also highly ionized and hence expected to be strongly magnetized ( see e.g. @xcite ) rendering magnetic dissipation .",
    "in fact , the celebrated blandford - payne mechanism @xcite ) is based on such a magnetized accretion disk in the keplerian regime , which argues for angular momentum transport due to outflows / jets through the outgoing magnetic field lines , in absence of shear ( turbulent ) viscosity .",
    "now an obvious question arises : what is the value of @xmath6 in optically thin accretion flows ( e.g. advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) @xcite , general advective accretion flow ( gaaf ) @xcite ) when the temperature is close to that of the qgp matter in rhic ? primarily guess is that it is not too much different from its lower bound as in equation ( [ ebs ] ) .",
    "is this that simple to anticipate ?",
    "note that accretion flows with very small molecular viscosity ( and then very large reynolds number ) exhibit turbulence and then turbulent viscosity .",
    "if the turbulent viscosity dominates , then the energy dissipated due to viscosity in disks is comparable / dominant to / over the magnetic / nuclear energy , as will be discussed in detail below .",
    "note also that at low densities ( zero chemical potential ) , lattice qcd calculations @xcite suggest a crossover from the hadronic state to the qgp state at around @xmath18k @xcite . at such high temperatures ,",
    "there is expected to be copious pion production in a strongly interacting system .",
    "this qgp state is thought to have existed a few microseconds after the big bang and is being extensively studied at rhic and lhc .",
    "of course the density in early universe is large as well , unlike that in accretion flows , a large temperature is well enough to reveal such a phase which has been mimicked in rhic / lhc .",
    "however , at a very large density ( several orders of magnitude larger than that in accretion flows ) the lattice qcd results are not valid ( zoltan fodor , private communication ) .",
    "recently , sinha & mukhopadhyay @xcite initiated to look at the above issue and argued that the shakura - sunyaev turbulent viscosity parameter @xmath19 @xcite should not be constant throughout the flow , and be decreasing with the increase of temperature and/or density of the flow .",
    "based on the general relativistic model of a viscous adaf , they showed that @xmath6 for an astrophysical black hole , at finite @xmath19 , is always several orders of magnitude higher than its value in a qgp fluid .",
    "then they argued for the flow to become very weekly viscous ( not exhibiting turbulence ) close to a black hole , rendering a smaller @xmath6 .",
    "the results appear to be independent of the choice of equation of state ( eos ) ; whether of ideal gas or of qcd which is appropriate for flows with @xmath20k and low density ( close to zero chemical potential ) .",
    "however , they could not clarify the natural circumstances when @xmath19 is small .",
    "note that small @xmath19 would reveal negligible dissipation of energy in the flow .",
    "hence , question arises what is the source of energy and entropy in the accretion flows , which is also very important in order to address @xmath6 ?",
    "in addition , how is the accretion possible in a very small-@xmath19 flow ? moreover , as will be explained in the next section , above work did not model the entropy of the flow adequately , while generally interpreted the results correctly . instead , that was the first step forward in the direction of evaluating @xmath6 for any astrophysical flow , eventhough incomplete , which is a potential natural site for small @xmath6 . in the present work ,",
    "we have removed the above uncertainties lying in the previous work",
    ". then we plan to establish the underlying physics giving rise to the astrophysical values of @xmath6 .",
    "more precisely , we plan to address : ( 1 ) regime of accretion flows giving rise to @xmath6 close to its theoretical lower bound , ( 2 ) observational implications of such regimes , ( 3 ) black hole sources presumably revealing lower bound of @xmath6 , ( 4 ) constraining physical parameters ( e.g. reynolds number ) of accretion flows based on @xmath6 bound .    in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the salient features of hot advective accretion flows and the importance of strong magnetic field and nuclear energy produced therein in order to obtain small @xmath6 .",
    "subsequently in  3 we analyse the solutions of the equations and address the flow parameters making @xmath6 to be close to the lower limit . finally  4 summarizes our findings with discussion and implication .",
    "in order to understand the underlying physics , let us consider the equations describing optically thin , viscous , magnetized , advective accretion disk @xcite .",
    "we describe the model in the pseudo - newtonian framework with the paczyski - wiita potential @xcite .",
    "this is particularly because , for the present purpose , the pure general relativistic results for a rotating black hole qualitatively do not reveal any new physics .",
    "hence , the vertically averaged hydromagnetic equations of energy - momentum balance along with the equations of continuity , induction and divergence of magnetic field in the limit of very large conductivity are @xmath21 assuming that the variables do not vary significantly in the vertical direction such that @xmath22 , which is indeed true for the disk flows . here",
    "@xmath23 is the conserved mass accretion rate , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the vertically integrated density and density of the flow respectively , @xmath26 is the radial velocity , @xmath27 the total pressure , @xmath28 the specific angular momentum , @xmath29 the vertically integrated shearing stress , @xmath30 the half - thickness , @xmath1 the entropy per unit volume , @xmath8 the temperature of the flow , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the vertically integrated net energy released and absorbed rates in / from the flow respectively , @xmath33 indicate the polytropic indices depending on the gas and radiation content in the flow ( see , e.g. , @xcite for exact expressions ) and @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the components of magnetic field .",
    "note that , the independent variable @xmath37 is the radial coordinate of the flow expressed in the units of @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the gravitation constant , @xmath40 the mass of the black hole and @xmath41 the speed of light .",
    "accordingly , all the above variables are expressed in dimensionless units . for any other details , see the existing literature @xcite .",
    "let us now pay a special attention to the energy equation of the equation set ( [ eqnset ] ) .",
    "we can rewrite it as t = q_vis+q_mag+q_nex - q_rad - q_nend , [ modion ] where @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively define the energies released per unit volume per unit time due to viscous dissipation , magnetic dissipation and thermonuclear reactions and @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively indicate the energy radiated away per unit volume per unit time by various cooling processes like bremsstrahlung , synchrotron and inverse - comptonization of soft photons , and the energy absorbed per unit volume per unit time due to thermonuclear reactions .    it was shown earlier that the nuclear energy released / absorbed in a hot accretion disk need not be negligible @xcite and the thermonuclear reactions therein could produce over - abundant metals",
    "@xcite which are observed in galaxies .",
    "however , the value of @xmath19 viscosity determines whether the energy due to nuclear reactions is comparable to that due to the viscous effects @xcite and ohmic dissipation or not . from equation ( [ modion ] )",
    "we can write down the entropy per unit volume , namely the entropy density , of the flow as s = dx .",
    "[ s ] now the turbulent kinematic viscosity @xmath47 , when @xmath48 and @xmath49 are respectively the turbulent eddy velocity and the size of eddy , which are respectively to be scaled linearly with sound speed ( @xmath50 ) of the disk and @xmath30 and hence = = c_s h , [ eta ] where @xmath51 , @xmath52 and hence @xmath19 are constants .",
    "therefore , the shear viscosity is given by = c_s h. [ eta ]    in an optically thin flow , often @xmath45 is approximately chosen to be proportional to @xmath53 , in order to understand the hydrodynamic properties of the flow without much loss of generality , such that @xmath54 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , when @xmath55 is a constant . for an adaf @xmath56 strictly ( and @xmath57 , when @xmath58 is the eddington accretion rate ) and for a gaaf @xmath59 ( and @xmath23 is larger than that in an adaf @xcite ) .",
    "note that @xmath60 for an optically thick keplerian accretion disk .",
    "hence , following previous work ( e.g. @xcite ) , we can write q_vis+q_mag - q_rad = f(q_vis+q_mag ) = f((i_n+1c_s^2+i_n^2)()+ ) , [ qvis ] where @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath62 , which we name as viscous regime , @xmath6 does not explicitly depend on @xmath19 ( and @xmath0 ) , , when @xmath63 .",
    "] depends only on the hydrodynamic quantities whose numerical values , in a fixed range of radii , do not vary significantly in the optically thin regime with the change of @xmath19 . in the viscous regime , @xmath6 simply scales with @xmath40 .",
    "note that viscosity depends on the size of the system , which in turn is determined by the mass of the black hole .",
    "hence , only for a primordial black hole of @xmath64gm , @xmath6 is close to its theoretical lower bound , as was suggested earlier @xcite .",
    "it was then also suggested that @xmath19 has to be very small in an adaf to obtain @xmath65 for an astrophysical black hole .",
    "however , for a small @xmath19 , viscous dissipation ( and then @xmath1 ) in an adaf ( or generally in a gaaf ) should be small as well , as is apparent from equations ( [ modion ] ) and ( [ qvis ] ) .",
    "hence , the ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath1 should not be invariably small , as described above , in the viscous regime .",
    "therefore , while the earlier work @xcite is very interesting and the first attempt to evaluate @xmath6 in an astrophysical flow , the flow ( and hence any conclusion ) should be amended with extra physics . in other words",
    ", the conclusion is incomplete .",
    "indeed @xmath6 could be small at a small @xmath19 when @xmath1 does not decrease in that extent with the decrease of @xmath19 . however , this is possible only when @xmath66 or / and @xmath67 , which we name magnetic and nuclear regimes respectively .",
    "the magnetic regime essentially corresponds to the blandford - payne mechanism in the hard spectral state , when accretion takes place via magnetic stress , independent of the presence of shear / turbulent viscosity @xcite .",
    "this plausibly corresponds to the case of accretion flows with outflows / jets , e.g. sgr  a@xmath16 , hard states of grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "hence , even at a negligibly small @xmath19 accretion is possible with a negligible @xmath6 .",
    "on the other hand , the nuclear reactions and corresponding energies depend on the density and temperature of the system .",
    "as shown earlier @xcite that even in the inviscid limit , temperature and density of the optically thin flows remain as high as those of a viscous accretion flow for a fixed @xmath40 , which successfully explain many observation @xcite .",
    "indeed , it was shown @xcite that significant nuclear energy ( @xmath68 ergs / cc / sec ) throughout the disk may be released / absorbed in an inviscid flow which could lead to disk instability .",
    "hence , from equation ( [ s ] ) it is naturally possible that @xmath1 is large even at a small @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , @xmath69 also plausibly in the nuclear regime of the accretion flow , when @xmath70 which could be the case in the hot accretion flows @xcite .",
    "let us understand the above physics quantitatively .",
    "figures [ m10b]a , b , c show hydrodynamic / hydromagnetic properties of a disk around a @xmath71 nonrotating black hole in the magnetic regime , accreting mass at the rate @xmath72 . in this case of weakly viscous hot flow with @xmath73 ( but not zero exactly ) , @xmath6 is shown to be close to the theoretical lower bound @xmath74 .",
    "for comparison , @xmath6 is also shown for a viscous regime , which is quite large for @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "we also show the variations of mach number and magnetic field in the disk for the cases mentioned above for reference .",
    "interestingly , increase of magnetic field in the magnetic regime increases rate of transport which further renders advancing the keplerian disk towards the black hole , making the sub - keplerian regime , which is shown here , smaller . figures [ m10b]d , e , f depict the properties for @xmath77 in the magnetic regime . a very small ( but nonzero ) @xmath19 ( @xmath78 ) reveals @xmath6 to exhibit the theoretical lower limit .",
    "the impact of change of the magnetic field strength to the disk is same as that in the high accreting case discussed above .",
    "interestingly , independent of the accretion rate , magnetic field @xmath79 kg is able to transport matter efficiently in the sub - keplerian flow in absence of viscosity , as was already argued by blandford & payne @xcite in the keplerian , self - similar framework .",

    "note that the production of nuclear energy also depends on the residence time of matter in the disk which is determined by @xmath19 , polytropic constant @xmath94 , initial mass fraction of the inflowing isotopes etc . for comparison",

    "we also show the variations of mach number and temperature in the disk for the cases mentioned above for reference .",
    "interestingly , the latter profiles overlap each other in the nuclear regime , independent of @xmath95 , and are very similar to that in the viscous regime .",
    "this also verifies that the mach number and temperature do not depend much on @xmath19 , in the optically thin flows .    in fig .",
    "[ mix ] , we show a couple of sets of solutions for highly sub - eddington hotter flows and a solution set for a low angular momentum , high mass accreting , hot flow , in the nuclear regimes . interestingly , a very low angular momentum ( @xmath96 ) , gas dominated , hot accretion flow with @xmath90 ( solid line ) violates the theoretical lower limit of @xmath6 .",

    "this is possible in the cases of hot , optically thin , accretion flows .",
    "more precisely , in order to have a small @xmath6 , flow should be magnetically dominated and/or producing huge energy / entropy other than that due to viscosity .    the celebrated blandford - payne mechanism @xcite was already shown to produce accretion via magnetic stress ( which helps in producing outflows / jets and removing angular momentum ) in absence of viscosity in the framework of keplerian , self - similar flow .",
    "we have employed this idea , but relaxing self - similar assumption , in order to obtain @xmath6 close to @xmath74 in our accretion flows .",
