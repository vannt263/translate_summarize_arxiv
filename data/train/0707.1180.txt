    "<S> using the data coming from the new 182 gold type ia supernova samples , the baryon acoustic oscillation measurement from the sloan digital sky survey and the h(z ) data , we have performed a statistical joint analysis of the dgp brane - world model with a high curvature gauss - bonnet term in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> consistent parameters estimations show that the gauss - bonnet - induced gravity model is a viable candidate to explain the observed acceleration of our universe .    </S>",
    "<S> a variety of cosmological observations suggests a concordant compelling result that our universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion , which is one of the deepest theoretical problems in cosmology  @xcite . within the framework of general relativity </S>",
    "<S> , the acceleration must be associated with the so called dark energy , whose theoretical nature and origin are the source of much debate . despite the effective negative equation of state @xmath0 from the robust observational evidence , we know little about the dark energy .    </S>",
    "<S> an alternative approach which does not need dark energy to explain the late - time acceleration is motivated by sting theory via the brane - world scenarios . in the late - time universe , one of the simplest extra - dimensional brane - world model which describes the cosmological evolution at low energies is the dgp model  @xcite ,  @xcite . in this model , </S>",
    "<S> gravity leaks off the 4-dimensional brane into the 5-dimensional bulk at large scales . </S>",
    "<S> gravity leakage at late - times initiates acceleration due to the weakening of gravity on the brane , without the need of introducing the mystery dark energy .    however , the dgp model which modifies einstein s general relativity in a consistent manner in the infra - red is not free of problems . </S>",
    "<S> the most serious one is that such modified theories suffer from classical and/or quantum instabilities , at least at the level of linear perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> most candidate braneworld models , have been shown to suffer from such instabilities or strong coupling or both , @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> generically , a ghost mode appears in the perturbative spectrum of the theory at the scale where gravity is modified , effectively driving the acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> therefore some kind of ultra - violet completion is needed for the dgp model in order to be safe at strong coupling .    </S>",
    "<S> there have been some attempts to generalize the dgp model so that they can show ultra - violet modifications to general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> one possible way is to introduce a high curvature gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term in the gravitational action to display the higher energy stringy corrections  @xcite ,  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an intriguing cosmological model with the combination of infra - red and ultra - violet modifications by introducing the gb term in the 5d minkowski bulk containing a friedmann brane with dgp induced gravity , was presented in  @xcite . in the general gb correction to the induced gravity </S>",
    "<S> , the late - time self acceleration of the universe is still kept , and striking new behaviour in the early universe is also shown  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is of great interest to investigate whether such model is a viable cosmological model .    </S>",
    "<S> the pure dgp model was tested using data from various observations  @xcite . in this work we are going to impose constraints on the model parameters by using the latest snia data compiled by riess et al  @xcite , the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) measurement from the large - scale correlation function of the sloan digital sky </S>",
    "<S> survey(sdss ) luminous red galaxies @xcite in combination with the h(z ) data . </S>",
    "<S> we will compare our results with the cosmological consequences of the dgp model as they were discussed in  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite to see the influence of the gb effect on the dgp model and also disclose the value of the gb parameter from observations . </S>",
    "<S> the gb correction term has been found effective on the modification of the cosmological evolution around @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this has been reported , for example , on the influence of the equation of state either in the modified rs model or the modified dgp model @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> all the tests we will use to constrain the parameters of our model are for relatively low redshift data </S>",
    "<S> . it would be interesting to test our model for high redshifts using observational data from cmb anisotropies and matter power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> however , this would require the knowledge of evolution of density perturbations of our model , a subject which is not fully understood even in the pure dgp model @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> combing the gb term in the bulk with the induced gravity on the brane , the friedmann equation on the dgp brane can be described by the dimensionless variables in the form of  @xcite @xmath2 where the dimensionless variables are @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the conservation equation becomes @xmath4 where the prime denotes @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the equation of state . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7 is the crossover length scale , which is two times of the value defined in  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the gb coupling constant which has the dimensions of @xmath10 .    as discussed in  @xcite , the physically relevant self - accelerating solution which is the generalization of the dgp model exists when @xmath11 and has the friedmann equation @xmath12 </S>",

    "<S> , the cross - over scale obeys  @xcite @xmath28 while in the dgp(+ ) limit ( @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that the physically relevant self - accelerating solution of the gb correction to the induced gravity has a finite temperature big bang , since the density @xmath31 is bounded from above  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this upper bound is also the requirement of real value of the square root in eq  ( [ 4 ] ) and eq  ( [ 6 ] ) which is @xmath32 requiring @xmath33 , ( there is a milder condition : @xmath34 ) we can have @xmath35 which is the initial hubble rate for the model </S>",
    "<S> . then the upper bound density of gb corrected induced gravity model reads @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the initial density with @xmath34 . if @xmath38 , dgp model will be restored and @xmath39 .    using the induced gravity model with the gb term of the bulk to describe the physically relevant self - acceleration </S>",
    "<S> , the density upper bound indicates that our universe started from a finite redshift @xmath40 instead of a singularity at @xmath41 . for the universe without dark energy , @xmath18 the upper bound on the density leads to @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the redshift we have the observational data and @xmath40 is the starting moment of the universe in this model .    in the following we are going to constrain this model by using the latest observational data , such as the gold sn ia data , the bao measurement from sdss and combing these obsevations with h(z ) data .    </S>",
    "<S> the up - to - date gold sn ia sample was compiled by riess et al  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this sample consists of 182 data , in which 16 points with @xmath44 were obtained recently by the hubble space telescope(hst ) , 47 points with @xmath45 by the first year supernova legacy survey(snls ) and the remaining 119 points are old data . </S>",
    "<S> the sn ia observation gives the distance modulus of sn at the redshift @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the distance modulus is defined as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the dimensionless luminosity distance and it given by    @xmath49  .    from eq  ( [ 6 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> we see that there are two parameters @xmath50 ,  @xmath51 in the model . </S>",
    "<S> eq  ( [ 7 ] ) tells us that @xmath52 is a function of @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in order to place constraints on the model , </S>",
    "<S> we perform @xmath53 statistics for the model parameter @xmath54 the best - fit values of parameter are shown in table  [ t1 ] , where we have done the marginalization of the nuisance parameter @xmath55 . with the best - fit values of @xmath50 ,  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath51 we can get other parameters @xmath52 ,  @xmath9 from their relations , which are also listed in table  [ t1 ] . in fig  [ one](a ) , we present the contours of 68.3% , 95.4% and 99.7% confidence levels . </S>",
    "<S> it is of interest to disclose parameters such as @xmath56 , @xmath57 which have direct physical meanings so that we can compare our model with the pure dgp model . </S>",
    "<S> recalling the relation between ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) and ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) and noting that the parameters transformations from ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) to ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) have non - zero jacobi determinant @xmath58 , we can obtain the constraint on the physical parameters ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) from the snia observations . </S>",
    "<S> the best - fit values are listed in table  [ t1 ] and contours are shown in fig  [ one](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that if we use only the snia data , the constrains are not good and the @xmath59 range is large .    </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table iv is actually the result of fitting of our model to the observational data ( at late - time with small redshifts ) . </S>",
    "<S> the central zero @xmath51 corresponds to the infinite @xmath40 , where the gb effect can be neglected and then the model reduces to the pure dgp . </S>",
    "<S> however , what is significant here is that the result is quite sensitive to @xmath51 . even small nonzero @xmath51 will cause dramatic change in the evolution of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> table iv takes @xmath51 just at the edge of @xmath59 contour , which illustrates that the effect of gb is significant and quite possible . for the modified dgp model by including the gb correction , </S>",
    "<S> it was argued that the combined induced gravity and gb effects make the universe start at a finite maximum density and finite pressure , but with infinite curvature@xcite . in other words , the universe described in this model does not start at @xmath41 , but starts at a finite @xmath46 which is the maximum redshift allowed in the model . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath40 in table iv is this maximum redshift when the combined induced gravity and gb effects are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is a question of the high energy - early - time behaviour of the model . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum @xmath40 allowed from table iv is too small to accommodate the conventional cmb formation at high redshifts even if we had the technology to calculate such effects in our model ( see @xcite for such an attempt ) . therefore , to go to high redshifts region we have to fine - tune @xmath51 to very small values , making the contribution of the gb term at late - times negligible .    </S>",
    "<S> in summary , in this work we have preformed a parameter estimation of the induced gravity model with a higher curvature gb term in the bulk proposed in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have analyzed data coming from the most recent sn ia sample , lss observation and h(z ) measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that the dgp model with the gb correction is a viable candidate to explain the observed acceleration of our universe . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the gb parameter allowed by observation is very small giving only small effects to the corrected dgp model . </S>",
    "<S> these correction effects are sensitive to changes of the gb parameter . </S>",
    "<S> a nonzero value of @xmath51 will change significantly the cosmological evolution of our universe . however , to make our model consistent with the conventional cmb formation at high redshifts the gb parameter has to be fine - tuned to very small values . </S>"
