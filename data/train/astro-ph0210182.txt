    "the formation of low - mass stars has received considerable attention , but the process by which material moves from the outer envelope to the central protostar is still debated .",
    "theories differ , primarily , in their prediction of the density , @xmath13 , and velocity , @xmath14 , as a function of radius , @xmath15 .",
    "larson ( 1969 ) and penston ( 1969 ) proposed a model with initial conditions of constant density and zero velocity .",
    "their model encounters problems due to its prediction of supersonic infall velocities that are not observed in regions of low - mass star formation ( zhou 1992 ) . shu ( 1977 ) proposed a scenario where infall begins from the inside , i.e. , inside - out collapse .",
    "the initial density configuration is a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) with @xmath16 .",
    "collapse begins at the center and propagates outward at the sound speed , @xmath17 , leaving behind a density distribution that approaches @xmath18 .",
    "some perturbations to the shu model include rotation ( terebey , shu , & cassen 1984 ) and magnetic fields ( galli & shu 1993 ) .",
    "mclaughlin & pudritz ( 1997 ) proposed a different model in which accretion increases with time .",
    "their scenario was similar to shu ( 1977)a collapse front propagating into a static envelope  but , because of differing initial conditions and a polytropic equation of state , they predict a much shallower density profile in the static envelope ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "foster & chevalier ( 1993 ) conducted hydrodynamical calculations of the collapse of a bonnor - ebert sphere and found the density approaches a @xmath20 distribution at small radii .",
    "other models exist with various predictions in the density distribution , @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , observational determinations of this density distribution can help us to discern the physical processes governing the formation of low - mass stars .",
    "classification of the stages in protostellar evolution has grown more detailed .",
    "initially , lada et al .",
    "( 1987 ) used the infrared spectral index to define classes i - iii .",
    "later , myers & ladd ( 1993 ) proposed a classification of these forming stars based on their bolometric temperature ( @xmath11 ) ; this classification scheme was further codified by chen et al .",
    "andr et al .",
    "( 1993 ) defined a criterion to discern class 0 from class i cores : the ratio of the submillimeter to bolometric luminosity . in this paper , we refer to the inverse of this quantity ( @xmath22 ) , a quantity that presumably increases with time .",
    "the luminosity of a low - mass core ( protostar@xmath23envelope ) is emitted mostly at infrared wavelengths due to the reprocessing of higher energy radiation from the central protostar by dust grains in the envelope .",
    "these heated grains also emit detectable radiation at submillimeter wavelengths . because the cloud is optically thin to this radiation , a measure of this dust emission renders a sampling of the entire mass in the cloud . in the past",
    ", astronomers have used single bolometers to detect this emission , but resolution and sensitivity limited their progress .",
    "submillimeter bolometer arrays , such as scuba , have allowed us to map this dust emission from the protostellar envelopes and , for the first time , draw conclusions about the nature and distribution of mass within these envelopes .    in this paper , we present the observations and modeling of class i cores .",
    "we describe our sample selection , observations , data reduction , and some basic data analysis in section 2 . in section 3 , we discuss various aspects of modeling these sources .",
    "power law models were the primary focus , but we also present simpler top hat models of the density distribution . also , we report on shu collapse models for nine sources . additionally , in this third section , we compare the application of simpler analyses to our more detailed models . also , we evaluate some possible scenarios where a disk is present and how the disk affects the modeled density profile . in section 4 ,",
    "we discuss some individual sources .",
    "section 5 holds a discussion of masses , classification , and the density structure of class i protostars .",
    "finally , in section 6 , we summarize our conclusions .",
    "the frugal reader , who wishes only for our major conclusions , can focus primarily on sections 3 , 5 , and 6 .",
    "in shirley et al . ( 2000 , hereafter , paper i ) , we presented the results from observations of a sample ranging from class @xmath24 to class i cores . in that sample , the presence of multiple sources within the observed field was common for the class i sources but uncommon for the class 0 objects .",
    "therefore , shirley et al . suggested that many class i sources might appear as such because of the existence of multiple sources within the iras beam .",
    "this suggestion was one motivation for observing this sample of class i objects : to determine the existence and effect of multiplicity .",
    "in addition , we hoped to present a similar treatment and analysis as in papers i - iii ( shirley et al .",
    ", 2000 ; evans et al . 2001 ; shirley et al .",
    "2002)i.e . , determining source characteristics and proposing possible density and temperature profiles through simulations with a one - dimensional radiative transfer code .",
    "we have selected a sample of sixteen sources ; these are listed in table 1 with their positions in b1950.0 and j2000.0 coordinates .",
    "the positions were obtained , mostly , from the iras psc as well as from 2 @xmath25 m observations pursued by tamura et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and moriarty - schieven et al .",
    "( 1994 ) .",
    "the distances to these sources range from 140 to 450 parsecs ( pc ) , but most of the objects ( 13 ) are in the nearby taurus star - forming region at 140 pc ( elias 1978 ) .",
    "we adopt a distance of 450 pc for cb230 ( launhardt & henning 1997 ) , 300 pc for l1251b ( kun & prusti 1993 ) , and 320 pc for iras 03256 + 3055 in perseus ( de zeeuw 1999 ) . the distance for perseus",
    "is based on recent hipparcos observations and differs from that used in papers i & iii ( 220 pc ) .",
    "we classify the cores in our sample by their bolometric temperature ( @xmath26 k for class i ) .",
    "therefore , two objects , l1251b and iras 03256 + 3055 ( with @xmath27 k ) , are not included in the average values for various parameters describing class i cores .      we observed this sample of class i sources with scuba , the submillimeter continuum users bolometer array ( holland et al .",
    "1999 ) , on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) atop mauna kea , hawaii . over four nights in november 1999 and february 2000 , we mapped each of these cores at 850 and 450 @xmath25 m by the 64-point jiggle map method that fully samples a field of 23 .",
    "since we expected to see very extended emission , we adopted a five - point mapping technique with 30@xmath28 spacings between each of the five 64-point jiggle maps . by this method , we removed the effects of bad bolometers and integrated for a longer time on the central 2@xmath29 of the map . in some sources",
    ", we increased the coverage of our maps to include extended emission .",
    "we performed pointing and skydip measurements between each five - point map .",
    "the average pointing rms , over the four nights of observations , was @xmath3020 .",
    "we measured the sky opacity via the skydip method at 450 and 850 @xmath25 m ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) while also recording the opacity as measured by the cso radiometer at 225 ghz ( @xmath33 ) . in our calculation of @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    ", we used the updated hot and cold load temperatures as given by archibald et al .",
    "in addition , we find a relationship between @xmath34 and @xmath36 that is in agreement with that presented by archibald et al .",
    "we list all opacity measurements in table  [ opacity ] .",
    "observations of uranus ( november 1999 ) and afgl 618 ( february 2000 ) were used to determine the beam profile of the jcmt . in figure  [ beams ] , we show the radial intensity profiles of these point sources for various times during the night  our observing shift was from about 1730 - 0130 , hawaii - aleutian standard time ( hst ) .",
    "two points should be considered in regard to these beam profiles : the significant and variable nature of the sidelobes and the changing fwhm size of the beam ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "first , mueller et al . (",
    "2002 ) noted the significance of sidelobes in their treatment of dust continuum emission from massive star - forming regions .",
    "they find that disregard of these sidelobes and the assumption of a gaussian beam can cause the derived density power law index to be shallower by @xmath380.4 . indeed , the beam profiles in figure  [ beams ]  show considerable power ( about @xmath39 of the maximum ) in the second and , sometimes , third sidelobes . additionally , we find the sidelobes become smaller as the night progresses and the dish cools .",
    "second , for both nights , the 450 @xmath25 m beam profile has a large fwhm ( @xmath3811@xmath28 ) at about 1800 hst , but the beamsize decreases to @xmath40 at about midnight ( hst ) . for november 1999 ,",
    "as shown in figure  [ beams ] , the 450 @xmath25 m fwhm decreased by 3@xmath28 as the night progressed .",
    "however , because the s / n is much better and the beam more stable at 850 @xmath25 m , we relied more heavily on it in the determination of certain source properties ( e.g. , the deconvolved fwhm size ) .",
    "the 850 @xmath25 m beam profile is also variable ( @xmath41 ) , however , and we propagate this variability as an uncertainty in the measured properties dependent on the beamshape .",
    "additionally , in our modeling , we used the observed beam profile that is closest in time to the source observation . in one case ( cb230 ) , where there were no beam profiles within one hour in time , we took the time - weighted average of two neighboring beam profiles ; in all other cases , the beam profiles were taken from observations of uranus or afgl 618 that were within one - half hour of the source observation . while the existence of and variations in the sidelobes _ significantly affect the analysis of radial intensity profiles , we have taken great care to remove uncertainties due to these imperfections .",
    "_      we analyzed and reduced our data with the scuba user s reduction facility ( surf ) ( jenness & lightfoot 1997 ) .",
    "the first - order effects of chopping had already been removed from the raw data , so our reduction entailed flatfielding , extinction correction , removal of sky variations , and the coadding and rebinning of the maps .",
    "this process of data reduction is described in paper i. the contour maps ( with greyscale ) for 850 and 450 @xmath25 m are in figures  [ contour_a]-[contour_e ] .",
    "we calibrated our flux measurements through observations of uranus and afgl 618 , a primary and secondary calibrator , respectively .",
    "we measured total voltages within 40@xmath28 and 120@xmath28 apertures . by dividing these values into the expected flux from each of these sources",
    "jy and @xmath42 jy . the fluxes for afgl 618 were @xmath43 jy and @xmath44 jy as reported on the scuba secondary calibrator web page .",
    "these fluxes for afgl 618 are comparable ( within uncertainty ) to the fluxes given , recently , by jenness et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . _ ] , we obtained the nightly calibration factors .",
    "for each night , we average the calibration factors and report this average in table  [ opacity ] . in february , we observed afgl618 seven times and found significant variations ( @xmath3840% ) in our measurement of its flux at 450 @xmath25 m .",
    "these variations are reflected in the large standard deviation reported as uncertainties ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) in table  [ opacity ] . to account for uncertainty in the flux calibration ,",
    "we take the average of the calibration factors as determined from the observations from all three nights in february and propagate the standard deviation as uncertainty in the flux measurement .",
    "this final average was used in the voltage - to - flux conversion for data obtained in february , 2000 , and is reported in table  [ opacity ] .",
    "we find the flux for each of our images by first measuring the total voltage within 40@xmath28 and 120@xmath28 apertures .",
    "then , we use the calibration factors given in table  [ opacity ] to convert these values to flux measurements . the fluxes at 450 and 850 @xmath25 m are given in table  [ flux ] .",
    "statistical and calibration errors dominate our uncertainty ( calculated as in paper i , equation 2 ) . in the modeling of these sources ,",
    "we use the _ normalized intensity ( @xmath47 ) , so uncertainty in calibration has no effect on analysis of the radial profile . _    in our february 2000 observations , we had maps with a high signal - to - noise ratio , but the calibration errors approach @xmath48 at 450 @xmath25 m ( e.g. , l1251b ) . in table",
    "[ flux ] , we include the s@xmath49n ratio to give an indication of the quality of our maps .",
    "additional photometry information is given in table  [ sed ] .",
    "the peak intensity centroids are given in table  [ flux ] .",
    "in addition , for iras 04016 + 2610 and 04361 + 2547 , we give the flux and centroid for neighboring condensations . in table",
    "[ src_prop ] , we give the calculated values for @xmath11 , @xmath50 , and @xmath12 .",
    "we define an aspect ratio for each of the sources by dividing the major and minor axis lengths as measured at the 2-@xmath51 contour .",
    "these values are reported in table  [ src_prop ] .",
    "for some cores ( e.g. , iras 03256 + 3055 , 04016 + 2610 and 04108 + 2803 ) , the major and minor axes were not discernable . in some cases ,",
    "the cores are not ellipsoidal but , instead , have extensions in different directions . also , the aspect ratio defined by the outer contours does not always reflect the morphology of the inner contours .",
    "the average aspect ratio was 1.3@xmath300.4 with the most aspherical source being iras 04248 + 2612 with an aspect ratio of 2.3 .",
    "for each modeled source , we determine the deconvolved source size ( @xmath52 ) from the fwhm size of the beam ( @xmath37 ) and source ( @xmath53 ) intensity profiles : @xmath54 .",
    "the values for @xmath55 are in table  [ src_prop ] ; the reported uncertainties are based on the variability of @xmath37 ( @xmath56-@xmath57 ) . in most cases ( @xmath3870% ) , we resolve the emission , but the observed source size is sometimes comparable to the fwhm of the beam .",
    "for example , iras 04295 + 2251 , with @xmath58 , has an observed intensity profile that , at the fwhm , is only 1.3 times the fwhm of the beam ( i.e. , @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) . in figure",
    "[ beams ] , we showed that the fwhm beamwidth does change slightly as the telescope cools .",
    "however , this mostly affects the 450 @xmath25 m beam , and we derive our deconvolved source sizes from the 850 @xmath25 m profiles . any source with @xmath61",
    "is definitely resolved .",
    "of course , those sources with @xmath62 are clearly unresolved . for those sources with @xmath63",
    ", we have more closely analyzed their profiles . iras 04113 + 2758",
    "was observed in november 1999 when the fwhm of the beam was quite variable ( @xmath64 ) , so we do not consider this a resolved source .",
    "iras 04016 + 2610 , 04239 + 2436 , and 04295 + 2251 were all observed in february 2000 , when the 850 @xmath25 m beam was fairly stable .",
    "we consider each of these sources to be resolved .",
    "further , we determine @xmath55 from the fwhm of the intensity profiles , but our data is sensitive out to 3 - 5 beamwidths for most sources  i.e . we do resolve the outer envelope emission from these cores . as we will show in section 3.1 ,",
    "the real discerning power of our observations is not in the inner regions but in the observations of emission from the outer regions of the envelope .",
    "also , several sources showed additional emission within the maps .",
    "for example , iras 04016 + 2610 , 04108 + 2803 , and 04361 + 2547 show sources of continuum emission that have comparable ( or even greater ) fluxes than the observed class i protostar . statistically , however , distinct ,",
    "neighboring condensations of dust are not common in our sample  only about 20% . in paper",
    "i , we suggested class i cores might be classified as such because of multiple sources within a beamwidth ; in that sample , multiple sources were found in 9@xmath4916 of the observed class 0 and class i cores .",
    "however , the occurrence of multiplicity is much less ( 3@xmath4916 ) in this sample of class i cores .",
    "as in paper iii , we have modeled the dust emission from a subset of these class i cores .",
    "we have selected the following sources for modeling based on their symmetric morphology and quality of data : cb230 , l1251b , iras 04166 + 2706 , iras 04169 + 2702 , iras 04239 + 2436 , iras 04248 + 2612 , iras 04295 + 2251 , iras 04361 + 2547 , and iras 04381 + 2540 .",
    "we use a modification of the radiative transfer package by egan , leung , & spagna ( 1988 ) , _",
    "csdust3 a ray - tracing , 1-dimensional radiative transfer code .",
    "this program has several input parameters : luminosity of the central source , opacity of the dust grains as a function of wavelength , strength of the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) , and the density distribution of material surrounding the source . _    primarily , we test power law density distributions , i.e. , @xmath65\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the density at a fiducial radius , @xmath67 au .",
    "the density has a lower limit of @xmath68 @xmath69 , roughly simulating the ambient molecular cloud .",
    "we choose these models because they are simple and , a priori , make no assumptions about the theory incorporated by the collapse of material . in a later section ,",
    "we do discuss the shu collapse model ( shu 1977 ) because it has only one free parameter and is easily tested .",
    "other theories of low - mass star formation ( e.g. , larson ( 1969 ) , mclaughlin & pudritz ( 1997 ) ; foster & chevalier ( 1993 ) ; henriksen , andr , & bontemps ( 1997 ) ; whitworth & ward - thompson ( 2001 ) ; etc . ) often differ primarily in the value of @xmath8 .    for each of the model parameters",
    ", we have tested a reasonable range on two test cases : cb230 and iras 04295 + 2251 .",
    "we selected these sources as test cases because of their high s@xmath49n maps and azimuthally symmetric morphology .",
    "the results from these tests are in tables  [ cb230 ]  and [ iras04295 ] . from these two test cases ,",
    "we have also determined the uncertainty in @xmath8 caused by the uncertainty in other parameters ( see table  [ error ] ) .",
    "the luminosity of the central source ( @xmath70 ) is determined by matching the modeled ( @xmath71 ) to the observed bolometric luminosity ( @xmath50 ) . at short wavelengths ( @xmath72 ) ,",
    "the cloud becomes optically thick , and the sed becomes more sensitive to opacity and geometry .",
    "therefore , for @xmath71 and @xmath50 we use only those flux points with @xmath73 @xmath25 m . for a given mass distribution ( constrained by the intensity profile ) ,",
    "we are able to determine the internal luminosity , @xmath70 , required to produce @xmath50 .",
    "this luminosity , @xmath70 , may include both the luminosity of the protostar as well as accretion luminosity  basically , any source of luminosity within the inner radius . in most cases",
    ", @xmath70 is less than @xmath50 because the interstellar radiation field contributes a portion of the observed bolometric luminosity , @xmath380.2 l@xmath74 .",
    "this is in accord with our results in papers ii and iii .",
    "we use dust opacities given by ossenkopf & henning ( 1994 ) for protostellar cores .",
    "they simulated the coagulation of dust grains ( with an initial standard mrn size distribution ) over @xmath75 yr and calculated the opacities for different initial gas densities .",
    "for the modeling of our sample , we compare two `` types '' of dust from table 1 of ossenkopf & henning . in papers ii & iii ,",
    "we have shown that the dust with thin ice mantles provides the best - fit models for preprotostellar and class 0 sources .",
    "the opacities for this dust are given in the fifth column of table 1 in ossenkopf & henning ( 1994 ) and , hence , it is named `` oh5 '' dust . in addition , we model sources with the opacities from column 2 of table 1 ( oh2 dust ) , representing dust grains without ice mantles . in the two test cases , we find that oh5 dust fits the sed best , but the choice of dust type introduces a negligible source of uncertainty in @xmath8 ( see table  [ error ] ) .",
    "we use the interstellar radiation field , given in paper ii , based on black ( 1994 ) and draine ( 1978 ) . for ultraviolet to far - infrared wavelengths , we introduce a factor , @xmath76 , to scale the isrf . for the two test cases , @xmath77 fits the data best , in accord with the isrf found to fit class @xmath24 and @xmath78 cores in papers ii & iii . for this sample , uncertainty in the isrf contributes a large source of uncertainty in @xmath8 : @xmath79 ( see table  [ error ] ) .    _",
    "csdust3 requires the input of an inner and outer radius as boundary conditions to be used in solving the radiative transfer .",
    "we have developed some practical criteria in determining these radii .",
    "we set the inner radius to 100 au for all sources  this corresponds to @xmath80 for the taurus sources , @xmath81 for cb230 , and @xmath82 for l1251b .",
    "the outer radius should be , at least , the sum of the chop throw ( 120@xmath28 ) and the radius of the model .",
    "for example , with cb230 ( at 450 pc ) , we used an outer radius of 100,000 au which accounts for the 120@xmath28 chop ( 54,000 au ) and for modeling out to 100@xmath28 ( 45,000 au ) .",
    "the outer radius for l1251b is 72,000 au ; for taurus sources , 33,000 au . we do choose a lower limit for the density ( @xmath83 @xmath69 ) , but , for most cores , the outer radius lies within this limit . in table",
    "[ error ] , we show the effect of varying the inner and outer radii on the derived value of @xmath8 . changes in the inner radius cause a negligible change in @xmath8 ; uncertainty in the outer radius causes an uncertainty @xmath84 in the modeling of cb230 and @xmath85 for iras 04295 + 2251 . _",
    "by assigning values to these various parameters and simulating the transfer of radiation in the envelope , we calculate the temperature for the assumed density distribution .",
    "then , as described in paper iii , we simulate the observations including the effects of chopping and convolution of the data with the observed beam profile .",
    "the selection of this beam profile was discussed in section 2.2 ; we took great care in using the appropriate beam since it does vary with time .",
    "while a gaussian beam will cause the derived value of @xmath8 to be steeper by @xmath380.4 , using an obseved beam profile from a different night causes negligible uncertainty ( see table 8) .",
    "we attempted modeling of iras 04302 + 2247 , a source that was obviously unresolved . in this case",
    ", we were only able to determine that @xmath86 , which , of course , we expect in the modeling of a point source .",
    "we constrain the total amount of mass in the envelope by normalizing the modeled sed to the observed 850 @xmath25 m flux , and the luminosity of the internal source is constrained by the observed luminosity , @xmath50 .",
    "then , we find the best - fit value for @xmath8 , which we select by the lowest @xmath87the sum of the @xmath88 values for the 450 and 850 @xmath25 m profiles ( see equation 4 in paper iii for the definition of @xmath89 ) . in most cases ,",
    "the best - fit model based on @xmath87 is identical to that selected by @xmath90 ( cf .",
    "l1251b , iras 04361 , and iras 04381 in table  [ power ] ) ; because the uncertainty is much smaller for the 850 @xmath25 m data , @xmath90 is much larger than @xmath91 and , hence , dominates the sum .",
    "even though the intensity profiles show nyquist sampled data , we use , as in papers ii and iii , only points spaced by a full beam to calculate @xmath89 .",
    "the derived value of @xmath8 is virtually unaffected by the envelope mass or the luminosity of the internal source .",
    "we list the best - fit models in table  [ power ] along with those models where @xmath92 and @xmath93 . in figures",
    "[ model_a]-[model_i ] , we show the modeled and observed seds , radial profiles , and temperature distributions for each of our modeled sources .",
    "we consider simple models of the density distribution in order to investigate the discerning capabilities of our methods ",
    "are we able to discern a power law distribution in the density from a top hat distribution ?",
    "we define a top hat density distribution as an envelope model where the density is constant from the inner radius to some `` break '' radius ; then , the density drops to 10@xmath94 @xmath69 in the region from this break radius to the outer radius .",
    "it should be most difficult to discern a power law from top hat distribution with the source for which we derive the steepest power law , @xmath95 for iras 04295 + 2251 . in figure  [ tophat ]",
    ", we show the modeled intensity profiles for three top hat distributions with breaks in the density at 5 , 15 , and 25  ( corresponding to 700 , 2100 , and 3500 au ) .",
    "the maximum density in the top hat functions is set so that the total mass is equal to that in the derived power law distribution .",
    "also , in this figure , we show the best - fit power law model along with the observed intensity profile for iras 04295 + 2251 .",
    "this intensity profile shows a `` bump '' at about 5000 au ( or 35 ) that is coincident with additional emission within the field - of - view .",
    "we find the 5  and 15  top hat functions do not have enough emission at large radii to reproduce the 850 @xmath25 m profile .",
    "the 25  top hat has emission in the outer regions that is not seen in either the 850 or 450 @xmath25 m observed profile .",
    "likewise , the intensity profiles of other sources in our sample are not easily reproduced by simple top hat functions .",
    "indeed , power law models , in contrast to the top hat functions , match the shape of the observed intensity profiles quite well .",
    "in addition to modeling power law density distributions for our sample of nine cores , we have modeled these sources with the shu inside - out collapse model ( shu 1977 ) .",
    "this model begins with a singular isothermal sphere with a density distribution that is proportional to @xmath20 . through some perturbation",
    ", collapse begins inside the cloud and proceeds outward at the sound speed ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "as collapse ensues , the cloud s density distribution is described by an outer , static region with @xmath96 and a region within the front of collapse ( or infall radius , @xmath97 ) whose density approaches @xmath98 ( indicative of freefall ) .",
    "the beauty of this theory is that there is only one free parameter : time .",
    "as time progresses , the front of collapse ( or infall radius , @xmath97 ) propagates outward at @xmath17 .",

    "we estimate the total contribution of the isrf to the observed luminosity to be about 0.2 l@xmath74 .    based on the standard picture of a class i protostar in which the observed luminosity results from accretion , we can calculate the mass of this protostar by a simple relationship ( e.g. , stahler 1994 ) : @xmath195 here , @xmath196 is the stellar mass , @xmath197 is the luminosity due to accretion , @xmath198 is the gravitational constant , @xmath199 is the stellar radius , and @xmath200 is the accretion rate given as @xmath201 , where @xmath202 is the isothermal sound speed and @xmath203 is a numerical constant of order unity ( stahler 1994 ) . assuming a minimum isothermal sound speed of 0.2 km s@xmath143 , we calculate @xmath204 m@xmath74yr@xmath143 . then assuming @xmath205 r@xmath74 , an overestimate of the stellar radius based on the models of stahler ( 1988 ) , we can calculate an upper limit on the stellar mass from this relationship . for the least luminous of the cores in this sample ( iras 04385 + 2250 ; @xmath206 l@xmath74 ) , the mass , based on equation 3 , is @xmath207 m@xmath74 or , since this in the substellar realm , @xmath208 m@xmath209 .",
    "the envelope mass for this core is 0.04 m@xmath74 , and , assuming a star formation efficiency of 25%  ( wilking et al .",
    "1989 ) , the final mass of this object would be @xmath210 m@xmath74 ( or 20 m@xmath209 ) in about @xmath211 yr ( assuming constant @xmath204 m@xmath74yr@xmath143 ) .",
    "this analysis holds many shortcomings and uncertainties .",
    "the mass accretion rate ( @xmath200 ) is highly uncertain , possibly episodic , and perhaps @xmath212 orders of magnitude smaller than that used in this calculation ( e.g. , muzerolle et al .",
    "such an accretion rate would increase @xmath196 by a factor of @xmath213 . on the other hand ,",
    "the observed luminosity is probably some combination of the disk accretion luminosity and luminosity of the central protostar .",
    "indeed , muzerolle et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find , in some cases , the accretion luminosities contribute @xmath214%  to the total observed luminosity . if only 10%  of the total luminosity results from accretion ( as estimated by muzerolle et al .",
    "1998 ) , the calculated stellar mass is a factor of 10 smaller .",
    "we can also estimate the stellar mass by other means .",
    "if we assume an age ( @xmath215 ) , we can place iras 04385 + 2250 on calculated isochrones .",
    "the models of siess et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , with @xmath216 yr , predict @xmath217 m@xmath74 .",
    "burrows et al .",
    "( 2001 ) give @xmath218 m@xmath74 for @xmath216 yr .",
    "these models probably overestimate @xmath196 , however , because they assume no accretion and have not considered the initial conditions governed by infall and collapse of the protostellar envelope .",
    "also , the age of embedded class i cores has been estimated to be @xmath219 yr ( e.g. , myers et al . 1987 , kenyon et al . 1990 ) ; most stellar evolution models begin at @xmath216 yr and are highly uncertain for ages less than @xmath220 yr .",
    "siess et al .",
    "( 1999 ) included accretion ( @xmath221 m@xmath74yr@xmath143 ) in their calculations of pre - main sequence evolutionary tracks , and , for @xmath222 yr , their models would indicate @xmath223 m@xmath74 ; unfortunately , these models do not include objects with masses lower than 0.1 m@xmath74 as required to accomodate iras 04385 + 2250 .",
    "additionally , the application of these models to class i cores is quite precarious ; these models are intended for t tauri stars .",
    "observations of young , forming ( class 0/i ) brown dwarfs have yet to be firmly established , but the existence of older substellar objects with disks ( e.g. natta & testi 2001 ) suggest that brown dwarfs do form by similar mechanisms as t tauri stars . if so , we , indeed , probably have observed brown dwarfs within their natal envelopes .",
    "then , it should not be surprising that , in this sample of low - luminosity class i cores , a fraction are substellar .",
    "indeed , kenyon & hartmann ( 1995 ) concluded similarly , i.e. the `` luminosity problem '' for class i objects is solved if such objects are substellar .",
    "of course , these authors also present another viable solution , that the accretion radius is larger in these young objects than we expect .",
    "currently , the class system ( class @xmath24iii ) implies a sequence of stages that are occupied at some point by all evolving protostars ( e.g. , andr & montmerle 1994 ) .",
    "hence , statistical arguments have been constructed by comparing the numbers of sources in each stage to establish the relative time spent in each epoch ( e.g. , andr & montmerle 1994 ) . as discussed previously , three criteria for classification have been put forth : @xmath227 ( lada et al .",
    "1987 ) , @xmath11 ( myers & ladd 1993 ) , and @xmath12 ( andr et al . 1993 ) .",
    "these values are given in table  [ src_prop ] for our sample of sources .",
    "for the selection of the sed points from which these values were calculated ( see table  [ sed ] ) , we required that the aperture be large enough to include all emission : @xmath228 .",
    "this restriction causes the exclusion of the near - infrared ( nir ) fluxes , but we also calculate @xmath11 with the nir data because the bolometric temperature is most affected by the nir data . the nir flux ,",
    "no matter how weak , causes this mean frequency to be skewed to higher values . indeed ,",
    "if we do not include the nir flux in our calculation of @xmath11 , 35%  of our class i sources become class 0 by the @xmath11 criterion . of course",
    ", class i sources are identified by their nir emission and are even called , by some , nir protostars .",
    "however , detection of the nir light is often dependent on orientation and , hence , could feasibly be obscured in an otherwise class i object .",
    "an additional complication in distinguishing between class i and 0 cores is found in the luminosity scheme developed by andr et al .",
    "they define a class i source as one for which @xmath229 , assuming that , as a protostar evolves , the envelope should be cleared away and , hence , this ratio should increase .",
    "originally , this indicator was based on measurements within a small aperture ( 20@xmath28 ) because of nearby sources .",
    "however , for our isolated cores , it is clear that such a small aperture does not sample the total submillimeter flux emitted by the object .",
    "therefore , we use only large aperture measurements ( @xmath230 ) in the calculation of these values ( table  [ src_prop ] ) ; for our submillimeter fluxes , we used the 40@xmath28 aperture fluxes in the calculation of @xmath12 so that nearby condensations would not contribute to the submillimeter flux .    in figure  [ class ] , we show a plot of @xmath11 versus @xmath12 that includes all sources from paper i and this paper .",
    "class i cores are characterized by @xmath231 ( myers & ladd 1993 , chen et al .",
    "1995 ) or @xmath229 ( andr et al . 1993 ) .",
    "we have subdivided the plot into four regions based on these boundaries .",
    "class i cores should be found only in the upper right - hand portion of the plot , and class 0 cores should be in the lower left - hand portion .",
    "this is clearly not the case . while there is a noticeable correlation between the two evolutionary indicators , the divisions between the classes are not so obvious",
    "indeed , all of the cores in this paper s sample are class i by the @xmath11 criteria ( except for l1251b and iras 03256 + 3055 ) ; half of these class i cores , however , are class 0 by the @xmath12 criterion .",
    "the problem arises in that the @xmath11 observable is greatly affected by geometry whereas @xmath12 is not so affected .",
    "visser , richer , & chandler ( 2002 ) also found such a discrepancy between these classification criteria .",
    "they find that the submillimeter luminosity criterion ( @xmath229 ) renders far fewer class i cores than does the bolometric temperature .",
    "further , they infer lifetimes for the evolutionary stages based on the numbers of class 0 and i cores . in order to create such statistical arguments concerning the lifetimes of class @xmath2321-iii objects",
    ", one must recognize that different numbers of class 0 or i objects will be found depending on the system of classification employed .",
    "the primary purpose of our modeling is to derive the actual distribution of matter in the envelopes of these forming protostars . for the class i cores in this paper , we find the density power law exponent @xmath6 ( mean @xmath30 the standard deviation of the sample ) ; however , the presence of a disk or point - like component could cause @xmath8 to decrease by as much as @xmath233 .",
    "the median for this sample of class i cores is @xmath7 . in paper iii",
    ", we reported @xmath234 for the class 0 sources .",
    "for the class 0 and i objects in papers iii and iv , we find @xmath6 , and the median is @xmath7 . if we leave out those class 0 or i sources with aspect ratios @xmath235 , a total of four sources from papers iii and iv , we find @xmath236 , and the median is also @xmath7 .",
    "we include these modeled sources in a histogram ( figure  [ hist_p ] ) both separately and together .",
    "the value for @xmath8 is clearly peaked between 1.5 - 2.0 , seemingly inconsistent with models that predict very shallow distributions ",
    "e.g . , mclaughlin & pudritz ( 1997 ) .",
    "however , these models should not be excluded altogether , for we do see evidence , in some sources , of a shallower profile , and the inclusion of a disk allows for significantly shallower density profiles .    in figure  [ aspect ] , for all modeled sources ( from paper iii and iv )",
    ", we show the aspect ratio as a function of @xmath8 . a clear correlation exists between these two values such that the more aspherical sources exhibit shallower profiles .",
    "of course , the azimuthal averaging of an aspherical object could result in a shallow intensity profile ( and , hence , shallower density profile ) , but we claim this is a small effect . in section 4.4 , we discussed the modeling of iras 04248 + 2612 and how the derived density power law changes negligibly with exclusion of the extended emission in the ne - sw extensions .",
    "we also found this to be true in aspherical , class 0 sources  see paper iii .",
    "as in paper iii , we find little evidence for variation of dust properties within the envelope .",
    "we compare the normalized intensity ratios ( @xmath237 ) in figure  [ spect ]   and conclude that , for most sources , the observed variations in this ratio are well - fitted by including the effects of external heating by the isrf and convolution of the actual beam . for l1251b ,",
    "iras 04361 + 2547 , and iras 04381 + 2540 , we are unable to simultaneously match the observed 850 and 450 @xmath25 m intensity profiles .",
    "the dust opacity may vary with radius in these sources , but it could also be that we have not appropriately modeled the temperature in these cores , perhaps , due to asymmetric heating , externally , by the isrf or , internally , by a disk@xmath23protostar or binary central source .",
    "while power law density distributions do not have a physical size , we define an observational size from the deconvolved fwhm of our modeled sources ( table  [ src_prop ] ) . in figure",
    "[ beams_p ] , we show the derived value for @xmath8 plotted against the effective size ( @xmath238 ) for the modeled class 0 and i cores ( from papers iii & iv ) . additionally , the solid line shows a series of models for @xmath239 for which the deconvolved model size is measured with the 15@xmath28 beam .",
    "the models show that steeper power laws are clearly less well - resolved in agreement with the observed trend .",
    "the trend in figure  [ beams_p ] , while not surprising , is quite striking ; smaller sources exhibit a larger value for @xmath8 .",
    "we stress this point for three reasons .",
    "first , terebey , chandler , & andr ( 1993 ) addressed this resolution issue  that steeper power law density distributions are less well - resolved .",
    "however , one must be very careful when analyzing the intensity profiles of marginally resolved sources because uncertainty in the beamshape can be @xmath240 ( see section 3.2 ) .",
    "indeed , there are examples of marginally resolved sources for which the authors have derived very steep density power laws ( @xmath241 ) , density distributions that have little theoretical basis .",
    "also , we propose an intriguing possibility implying this trend is not entirely systematic and might be indicative of some physical quality .",
    "perhaps , we are observing only the outer envelope of these less well - resolved cores .",
    "that is , these `` smaller '' sources are not small because they are more evolved and have collapsed over time , but they are small because they began with an initial preprotostellar core that was lower in mass and , hence , has a smaller outer radius than the other cores in our sample . in the shu collapse model",
    ", we would expect a steeper density profile in the outer , static envelope , and it might be that , indeed , we are seeing just that .",
    "a third scenario is also possible .",
    "perhaps , the `` smaller '' cores , which we interpret to have steeper density profiles , have a greater disk contribution .",
    "this point source of emission , as shown in a previous section , results in the derivation of a steeper power law distribution in the density . in this case",
    ", the envelope mass distribution could be considerably shallower that we predict here .",
    "indeed , if the disk contribution is more significant as the core size decreases , the trend for the envelope density distribution shown in figure  [ beams_p ] could be shifted such all cores harbor an envelope described by @xmath242 , a possibility that would suggest the validity of the theory presented by mclaughlin & pudritz ( 1997 ) .",
    "we compare these results to those recently presented by jrgensen , schier , and van dishoeck ( 2002 ) ( hereafter , jsd ) and find that we reach similar conclusions .",
    "these authors model two sources coincident with our sample : iras 04361 + 2547 and iras 04381 + 2540 , which they call tmr1 and tmc1 , respectively .",
    "our derived values of the density power law exponent for these two sources are consistent with those of jsd .",
    "however , their modeling differs from ours in the assigning of two parameters : the isrf and outer radius ; additionally , they do not simulate the effects of chopping .",
    "exclusion of the isrf should cause jsd to derive a shallower power law exponent to fit the observed data .",
    "also , jsd adopt much smaller outer radii than we do in this paper  in some cases , a factor of four smaller . by assigning a small outer radius and excluding the effects of chopping",
    ", these authors should derive a somewhat steeper power law for the density distribution than that presented here .",
    "the combination of these two effects ( i.e. , exclusion of the isrf and truncated outer radius ) seem to cancel in their analysis , rendering similar results to our own .",
    "as presented in the previous sections , we have discussed several caveats that hinder direct interpretation of the dust continuum emission : beam convolution of our model , complex temperature distributions due to external heating , different assumed dust opacities , contribution to the observed flux from a disk component , and the inner and outer radii assumed in the model .",
    "we do not analyze the effects of outflows because , for most of our sources , the outflows are either very weak or undetected ( e.g. , bontemps et al . 1997 ) .",
    "our modeling is also limited by its one - dimensional nature , but we point out objects for which three - dimensional modeling will prove fruitful ( e.g. , iras 04248 + 2612 ) .",
    "our assertion that asymmetric sources exhibit shallower density distributions suggests that these objects are forming in truly different environments .",
    "however , this issue will not be fully resolved until models of radiative transfer for three dimensions are completed .",
    "our conclusions are as follows :    \\1 ) we find that @xmath243 ( 20% ) of the sources in this sample have distinct , neighboring condensations ( iras 03256 + 3055 , 04016 + 2610 and 04361 + 2547 ) .",
    "these condensations could be the result of complex structure ( 03256 + 3055 ) , neighboring preprotostellar cores ( 04016 + 2610 ) , or the heating due to outflows ( 04361 + 2547 ) .",
    "\\2 ) we have fit power law models for the density distribution in the outer envelopes of nine class i cores and find @xmath6 and a median of @xmath7 .",
    "the existence of a disk or point - like component could cause @xmath8 to be much _ shallower  by about 0.5 .",
    "table  [ bestpower ] has a summary of parameters for the best - fit models . _",
    "\\3 ) we test the shu inside - out collapse model and find that , in most cases , this model provides a good fit for the intensity profile but with an infall radius that is within the central resolution element of our observations .",
    "most sources in this sample exhibit no evidence for a break in the power law density distribution on the scales we can probe with scuba ( @xmath110 au ) .",
    "\\4 ) we compare our analysis with a simpler analysis put forth by adams ( 1991 ) and as used in paper i. this method assumes a temperature power law ( with index @xmath116 ) and @xmath244 .",
    "these assumptions are invalid for these low luminosity sources , and this simple analysis overestimates @xmath8 by @xmath380.6 .",
    "\\5 ) in modeling the density distribution , we have determined several sources of uncertainty : possible existence of a disk ( @xmath245 ) , variations in the isrf ( @xmath246 ) , and uncertainty in the outer radius ( @xmath247 ) .",
    "contributions by the disk to the observed submillimeter flux will be addressed by such instruments as sma and alma while the isrf may be constrained by future observations in the mid- to far - infrared ( e.g. , sirtf ) .",
    "we find no evidence for a truncated outer radius in models completed over a wide range of radii .",
    "\\6 ) for our modeled sources , we have calculated the mass of the envelope surrounding the protostar : @xmath248 m@xmath74 for the two most luminous sources and @xmath249 m@xmath74 for those modeled sources in taurus .",
    "we find that these masses are clearly less than those found for class 0 cores ( paper iii ) and , further , contradict the virial masses predicted by n@xmath193h@xmath194 linewidths .",
    "molecular line tracers such as n@xmath193h@xmath194 simply do not trace the mass in these class i cores .",
    "\\7 ) the standard classification criteria , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , are sometimes inconsistent for class 0 and i cores .",
    "the mode of classification is important for studies that attempt to estimate core lifetimes based on the class 0 and class i source counts ( e.g. visser , richer , & chandler 2002 ) .",
    "\\8 ) sources with higher aspect ratios are better fitted with shallower density power laws . while this effect is partially due to our one - dimensional models ,",
    "we propose that , indeed , these sources are forming in physically different initial conditions .",
    "three - dimensional modeling will help to unravel this question .",
    "\\9 ) we note a trend between deconvolved fwhm source size and @xmath8smaller cores have higher values for @xmath8 .",
    "this trend is expected since steeper density power law distributions produce less well - resolved intensity profiles .",
    "it is also possible that we are observing the outer portions of the envelope in these less well - resolved sources .",
    "\\10 ) we have also discussed several sources individually . in particular ,",
    "iras 03256 + 3055 , with its unique morphology , is an ideal object on which to test theories of fragmentation in the formation of low - mass protostars .",
    "also , we note the possibility , through some simple calculations , that iras 04385 + 2550 is a young , forming substellar object with a mass of @xmath214 m@xmath209 .",

    "<S> we present results from the observations and modeling of seventeen class i cores with the submillimetre common users bolometer array ( scuba ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) . </S>",
    "<S> our sample consists of cores with 64@xmath0(k)@xmath1270 , @xmath2l@xmath3 , and @xmath4 . by modeling the transfer of radiation through the envelope for nine cores , we find , for a power law distribution @xmath5 , the average and standard deviation @xmath6 and a median of @xmath7 . however , the inclusion of a disk or other point - like component can cause the derived @xmath8 to be shallower by as much as 0.5 . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss uncertainties due to the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) , disks , dust opacity , and outer radii in our modeling results . </S>",
    "<S> we find no evidence for a truncated outer radius or radially variant dust properties in most sources . </S>",
    "<S> uncertainty in the strength of the isrf and possible existence of a disk contribute the greatest uncertainty in @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we test the shu collapse model for our sources and discuss the application of simpler analyses that derive a density power law distribution directly from the slope of the intensity radial profile . the total mass of the envelope in our sample has a range of @xmath9m@xmath10 , but these masses disagree with the virial masses derived from molecular line observations , indicating that observations of molecular lines do not trace the mass in some class i cores . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss several sources individually . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , iras 03256 + 3055 , with its unique morphology , is an ideal object for testing theories of fragmentation in the formation of low - mass protostars . </S>",
    "<S> also , we note the possibility , through some simple calculations , that iras 04385 + 2550 is a young , forming substellar object . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the nature of these sources in light of various evolutionary indicators and find that @xmath11 and @xmath12 are often inconsistent in distinguishing class 0 from class i cores . </S>",
    "<S> we note that , in this sample , the @xmath12 criterion redefines many of these class i sources ( by @xmath11 ) as class 0 sources . </S>"
