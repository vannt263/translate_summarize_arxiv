    "computational complexity theory based on a turing machine ( tm , for short ) was formulated in the 1960s .",
    "the complexity class @xmath0 was later introduced as the collection of sets that are recognized by nondeterministic tms in polynomial time . by the earlier work of cook , levin , and karp ,",
    "@xmath0 was quickly identified as a central notion in complexity theory by means of @xmath0-completeness .",
    "@xmath0 has since then exhibited its rich structure and is proven to be vital to many fields of theoretical computer science .",
    "meyer and stockmeyer @xcite further extended @xmath0 into a hierarchy , known as the _ polynomial ( time ) hierarchy_. this hierarchy has inspired many tools and techniques , e.g. , circuit lower - bound proofs and micro hierarchies within @xmath0 .",
    "there is known to be a relativized world where the hierarchy forms an infinite hierarchy .",
    "it is thus natural to consider a quantum analogue of @xmath0 , dubbed as `` quantum np , '' and its extension .",
    "several approaches have been made over the years to define quantum np .",
    "as is known , @xmath0 can be characterized in several different manners . as the first example",
    ", @xmath0 can be characterized by probabilistic tms with positive acceptance probability .",
    "adleman  @xcite introduced the complexity class @xmath1 as a quantum extension of this probabilistic characterization .",
    "subsequently , @xmath1 ( even with arbitrary complex amplitudes ) was shown to coincide with the classical counting class @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this shows the power of quantum computation .",
    "@xmath0 can be also characterized by logical quantifiers over classical ( binary ) strings of polynomial length .",
    "this is also known as the `` guess - and - check '' process .",
    "knill @xcite , kitaev @xcite , and watrous @xcite studied the complexity class @xmath2 ( named by watrous ) , which can be viewed as a quantum extension of the aforementioned quantifier characterization of @xmath0 . in their definition ,",
    "a quantifier bounds a quantum state instead of a classical string .",
    "we call such a quantifier a _ quantum quantifier _ to emphasize the scope of the quantifier being quantum states . using this terminology , any set in @xmath2",
    "is defined with the use of a single quantum quantifier over polynomial - size quantum states .",
    "it appears that a quantum quantifier behaves in quite a distinctive manner .",
    "for instance , kobayashi  @xcite recently pointed out that allowing multiple quantum quantifiers may increase the complexity of @xmath2 due to quantum entanglement ( in @xcite , @xmath8 is defined with @xmath9 quantum quantifiers ) .    from a different aspect",
    ", we can view the process of defining @xmath0 as an application of an operator that transforms a class @xmath10 to another class @xmath11 .",
    "for example , we write @xmath12 to denote the class @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the complement of @xmath15 .",
    "this prefix `` co '' in @xmath12 can be considered as the _ complementation operator _ that builds @xmath12 from @xmath10 .",
    "other examples are schning s bp - operator @xcite and wagner s c - operator @xcite .",
    "the classical existential quantifier naturally induces the so - called _",
    "@xmath3-operator_. with this @xmath3-operator , @xmath0 is defined as @xmath16 .",
    "similarly , we can consider a quantum analogue of the @xmath3-operator .",
    "one possible analogue was recently proposed by green  @xcite .",
    "they introduced the n - operator , which is an abstraction of @xmath1 .    to make the most of quantum nature , we define in this paper a quantum operator that expands the quantum existential quantifier used for @xmath2 and @xmath8 .",
    "this quantum operator is called the _ @xmath5-operator _ ( whose complement is the _",
    "@xmath6-operators _ ) .",
    "these quantum operators give a new definition for quantum np and its expansion , a quantum analogue of the polynomial hierarchy .",
    "our quantum operators , however , require a more general framework than the existing one .",
    "in the subsequent section , we discuss a general framework for the quantum operators .",
    "let our alphabet @xmath17 be @xmath18 throughout this paper .",
    "let @xmath19 be the set of all nonnegative integers and set @xmath20 .",
    "to describe a quantum state , we use dirac s ket notation @xmath21 . write @xmath22 to denote a hilbert space of dimension @xmath23 . in comparison with a classical ( binary ) string ,",
    "we use the terminology , a _ quantum string _ ( _ qustring _ , for short ) _ of size @xmath23 _ , to mean a unit - norm vector in @xmath24 .",
    "for such a qustring @xmath21 , @xmath25 denotes the _ size _ of @xmath21 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath26 for each @xmath27 to denote the collection of all qustrings of size @xmath23 and thus , @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath29 , the set of all finite - size qustrings .",
    "we use a multi - tape quantum turing machine ( qtm ) , defined in @xcite , as a mathematical model of quantum computations .",
    "a multi - tape qtm is equipped with two - way infinite tapes , tape heads , and a finite - control unit .",
    "we assume in this paper the following technical restriction on each qtm : a qtm is always designed so that all computation paths on each input terminate at the same time by entering its unique halting state after writing @xmath30 ( rejection ) or @xmath31 ( acceptance ) in the start cell of the designated output tape ( see @xcite for the discussion on the _ timing problem _ ) .",
    "thus , the length of a computation path on input @xmath32 is regarded as the _ running time _ of the qtm on @xmath32 . the transition function @xmath33 of a qtm",
    "can be seen as an operator ( called a _ time - evolution operator _ ) that transforms a superposition of configurations at time @xmath34 to another superposition of configurations at time @xmath35 .",
    "a qtm is called _ well - formed _ if its time - evolution operator is unitary .",
    "moreover , a qtm is said to have _ @xmath36-amplitudes _",
    "if all amplitudes in @xmath33 are drawn from set @xmath36 , where @xmath36 is the set of all complex numbers whose real and imaginary parts are approximated deterministically to within @xmath37 in time polynomial in @xmath23 . for a well - formed qtm @xmath38 and an input @xmath21 , the notation @xmath39",
    "$ ] denotes the acceptance probability of @xmath38 on input @xmath21 .",
    "similarly , @xmath40 $ ] denotes the rejection probability of @xmath38 on @xmath21 .",
    "we have used classical ( binary ) strings as standard inputs given into quantum computations . as a result , any quantum complexity class , such as @xmath1 or @xmath41 @xcite ,",
    "is defined to be a collection of subsets of @xmath42 .",
    "since a qtm acts as a unitary operator , it is legitimate to feed the qtm with a quantum state as an input .",
    "we call such an input a _ quantum input _ for clarity . as in the definition of @xmath8 , for instance ,",
    "such quantum inputs play an essential role .",
    "we thus need to expand a set of strings to a set of qustrings by considering a qustring as an input given to an underlying qtm .",
    "we use the following notation . for each @xmath43 , let @xmath44 denote the collection of all @xmath45-tuples @xmath46 such that each @xmath47 is a qustring of size @xmath23 .",
    "such an @xmath45-tuple is expressed as @xmath48 and also seen as a tensor product @xmath49 when the size of each @xmath47 is known . for brevity ,",
    "the notation @xmath50 means the sum @xmath51 .",
    "we also set @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the introduction of quantum inputs gives rise to an important issue , which is not present in the classical framework : the duplication of an input .",
    "the repetition of a quantum computation on a classical input is seen in , e.g. , the proof of @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the situation may change when we deal with a quantum input . since a fundamental principle of quantum computation , the so - called _ no - cloning theorem _",
    ", interdicts the duplication of an arbitrary quantum input , we can not redo even the same quantum computation on a single quantum input unless the copies of the quantum input are given _ a priori_. to establish a coherent but concise theory of quantum computation over @xmath55 , we need to allow the underlying quantum computation to access the quantum input repeatedly without disturbing other quantum states .",
    "schematically , we supply a sufficient number of its copies as `` auxiliary inputs . ''",
    "this guarantees the quantum extension of many existing complexity classes , such as @xmath41 , to enjoy the same structural properties .    for later convenience",
