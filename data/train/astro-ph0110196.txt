    "the general idea of the underlying event , the central engine , producing an observed gamma - ray burst ( grb ) is the gravitational collapse of a stellar mass object triggering a relativistically expanding fireball and/or a collimated jet .",
    "the mechanism of the conversion of the kinetic energy , connected to the outflow , into the observed radiation is not clear .",
    "shocks within the outflow or shocks imposed by the external medium tap the kinetic energy which is transferred to @xmath4-rays through a single or a combination of radiation processes .",
    "signatures of the gamma - ray epoch of the burst are hidden in the time evolution of the intensity ( the light curve ) and in its spectral behavior .",
    "this is especially true for individual emission episodes , pulses , that complex light curves are believed to consist of .",
    "only a small fraction of all bursts exhibit long and smooth pulses that are useful for such investigations .",
    "nevertheless , these have given a number of relations between different observables , which might lead to a deeper understanding of the creation of the @xmath4-rays , by giving clues to and constraining physical models .",
    "much effort has been devoted to the study of such relations separately , in their own right , while other works study purely the morphology of the light curve ( see , for instance , the review by ryde 1999 ) . however , the spectral and temporal behaviors are intimately connected and should in a proper treatment be studied together .",
    "a first such step was made in ryde & svensson ( 2000 ; hereafter rs00 ) who gave a self - consistent description , describing the complete spectral - temporal behavior of the decay phase of a pulse structure in the light curve .",
    "rs00 described , in detail , the most common behavior found in @xmath5 of long bright grb pulses .",
    "it is of specific interest to study the decay phase of a pulse structure , as it most probably describes a certain radiative regime of the emission ; for instance , it could contain information on the actual cooling of the emitting region . in the present paper , we explore the approach outlined in rs00 and search for other types of spectral / temporal behaviors , guided by the variety of behaviors of the light curve .    throughout this paper , we adopt the following notation .",
    "@xmath6 is the peak energy of the spectrum , defined as the photon energy where the power output is the largest , i.e. , the maximum of the @xmath7 spectrum , where @xmath8 is the photon energy in kev and @xmath9 is the specific photon flux ( photons @xmath2 s@xmath1 kev@xmath1 ) .",
    "@xmath10 is the photon flux at time @xmath11 ( photons @xmath2 s@xmath1 ) , and finally , @xmath12 is the photon fluence in @xmath2 , defined by @xmath13 .    for the spectral and temporal evolution there are the following three main observables to study , @xmath14 , @xmath10 , and the derived quantity , @xmath12 , neglecting a possible evolution of the instantaneous _ shape _ of the spectrum .",
    "the relations between these three observables are given by two correlations , chosen here as @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the most common types of these two correlations are @xmath15 being a power law function of @xmath17 , and @xmath16 being an exponential function of @xmath18 .",
    "one of the most important issues emphasized in rs00 is that there is an inevitable spectral / temporal connection , something that is not usually considered .",
    "for instance , rs00 showed that by combining these two empirical correlations , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , one obtains a specific power law decay behavior of @xmath10 and @xmath14 , where the @xmath10-decay @xmath19 has a power law index @xmath20 = 1 .    knowing two of the four behaviors , @xmath10 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , gives the other two .",
    "the question is which two of the four are the most fundamental ones .",
    "the way the research field has developed is that the two empirical correlations were established first .",
    "it has , on the other hand , not been obvious with which functional shape to fit the pulse light curve , @xmath10 .",
    "the most commonly assumed pulse shape is that of a stretched exponential , but there has been no motivation for this other than that it is a flexible pulse shape when making fits over the entire pulse . essentially no work has been done on fitting @xmath14 . with this history ,",
    "we focus on the three previously studied behaviors , @xmath10 , @xmath21 , @xmath16 .",
    "since the light curve is much better suited for statistical analysis , since the noise ( poisson statistics ) is relatively small ( as compared to the two correlations ) , we study what different shapes , @xmath10 , of the light curve lead to , assuming that one of the two empirical relations , @xmath15 or @xmath22 , is valid .",
    "the search is rigidly guided by the actual grb observations , which is complemented by an analytical treatment .",
    "some of the results have been presented in a preliminary form in ryde & svensson ( 2001 ) .    in   2 , we discuss the shape of individual pulses in the grb light curve , comment on the two common correlations , a power law @xmath15 and an exponential @xmath16 , describing the spectral evolution over time of such pulses , and , finally , what results for @xmath10 and @xmath14 the combination of these two correlations give rise to .",
    "the observations , made with the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on the _ compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) _ , and how the complete pulse sample was selected from the 9 years of operation are discussed in   3 . in   4 , we analyze the 25 light curve decays , and conclude that they are better described by a power law decay rather than by a stretched exponential .",
    "the decay index , @xmath20 , turns out to have a bimodal distribution , with approximately half the pulses having @xmath23 and the other half having @xmath24 but with a wide spread .",
    "this leads us in   5 to generalize the analytical treatment in rs00 , to cases with @xmath25 .",
    "these results are then used in   6 , to fit the data for three different cases .",
    "these are :    \\i ) the two correlations are given by a power law @xmath15 and an exponential @xmath16 , consequently the power law pulse decay has the index @xmath26 ;    \\ii ) the pulse decay , @xmath10 , is fitted as a power law of index @xmath20 , the exponential @xmath16 is assumed to be valid , and a fit is made to the generalized @xmath15 of   5 ; and finally    \\iii ) the pulse decay , @xmath10 , is fitted as a power law of index @xmath20 , the power law @xmath15 is assumed to be valid , and a fit is made to the generalized @xmath16 of   5 .",
    "we study , in particular , the 11 cases with @xmath24 , and find that about half preferably belongs to case ii ) and the other half to case iii ) .",
    "furthermore , we re - analyze these 11 pulse decays by relaxing @xmath20 to be free in the fitting of the generalized correlations .",
    "only four pulses are then sufficiently constrained and they are all consistent with a power law @xmath15 and that @xmath22 is given by the generalized function of   5 .",
    "in   7 , we elude on a few points in our analysis and discuss our results in a physical context .",
    "we finish off by summarizing our results in   8 .",
    "a remarkable feature of the observed properties of grbs is the large diversity of the light curves , both morphologically and in strength and duration .",
    "different approaches to understanding the light curve morphology have been pursued .",
    "it is generally believed that the fundamental constituent of a grb light curve is a time structure , a pulse , having a sharp rise and a slower decay phase , with the decay rate decreasing smoothly ( e.g. , fishman et  al .",
    "1994 ; norris et  al . 1996 ; stern & svensson 1996 ) .",
    "this shape is denoted by the acronym fred , fast - rise and exponential - decay , even though the decay is not necessarily exponential .",
    "a burst can consist of only a few such pulses , clearly separable , producing a simple and smooth light curve . in the same manner ,",
    "complex light curves are superpositions of many such fundamental pulses .",
    "mixtures of the two types are also common .",
    "such interpretations have been shown to be able to explain and partly reproduce many observed light curve morphologies . to reveal the underlying process of grbs , the fundamental pulses are of special interest as they probably show the clearest signature of the underlying physics .    to model the morphological shape of a _ whole _",
    "pulse , i.e. , its location in time , the amplitude , the width , the rise phase , the transition phase , and the decay phase , a `` stretched '' exponential is often used : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the time of the maximum photon number flux , @xmath29 , of the pulse , @xmath30 are the time constants for the rise and the decay phases , respectively , and @xmath31 is the peakedness parameter , equation ( [ stretch ] ) is , strictly speaking , a compressed exponential . ] .",
    "such a function gives a flexibility which makes it possible to describe the whole shape of most pulses , and to quantify the characteristics of the pulses for a statistical analysis .",
    "norris et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) studied a sample of bursts observed by the batse large area detectors ( lads ) and stored in four energy channels .",
    "they modeled the light curves in detector counts in the four channels separately and found that the decay generally lies between a pure exponential ( @xmath32 ) and a gaussian ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "lee et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) studied approximately 2500 pulse structures , in individual energy channels , using the high time resolution batse tts data type , modeling them with the stretched exponential function of equation ( [ stretch ] ) .",
    "they confirmed the general behavior that pulses tend to have shorter rise times than decay times .",
    "norris et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) also used equation ( 1 ) to create an algorithm to separate overlapping pulses based on @xmath34 fitting .",
    "scargle ( 1998 ) introduced an algorithm based on bayesian principles to estimate the characteristics of a pulse ( location in time , amplitude , width , and rise and decay times ) .",
    "this method has the advantage that it is independent of any explicit pulse shape model and exploits the full time resolution of the data .    in general , the rise and decay phases of a radiation pulse",
    "give us different aspects of the emitting region .",
    "in the case of a region becoming active , the rise phase describes the size of the region while the decay phase is determined by the cooling of it . to understand the radiation process involved in the cooling , it is of interest to concentrate the study to the decay phase .",
    "schaefer & dyson ( 1996 ) studied the decay phase of 10 smooth fred pulses in the four batse energy channels separately and found that most of them are not exponentials , although a few cases come close .",
    "a power - law fit passes most of their statistical tests .",
    "indeed , in the description of rs00 , on which we base the present work , the decay phase of a pulse is described with @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the start of the decay phase where @xmath37 .",
    "this will be discussed , in detail , in  [ rs00 ]",
    ". however , for such a behavior the fluence is divergent @xmath38 and therefore the decay of the intensity must eventually change into a more rapid one , or possibly be turned off completely .",
    "it is thus an important issue to understand the actual duration of individual pulses , for instance , for the interpretation of grb light curves as being a superposition of individual pulses .",
    "giblin et al . ( 1999 ) report on grb 980923 ( batse trigger 7113 ) as having an apparent transition from a prompt , relatively short and variable phase to a longer and smoother decay .",
    "they interpret this as the onset of the afterglow emission seen subsequently at other wavelengths .",
    "furthermore , stern ( 1999 ) showed a few examples of grb pulses with near - exponential tails that are traceable over almost 4 orders of magnitude in intensity .",
    "stern ( 1999 ) argues that nonlinear properties of an optically thick pair plasma could produce this .",
    "when the emitting system is turned off , the large pair optical depth can disappear quickly as the plasma annihilates on the short time scale of a few light crossing times .",
    "there are several examples of light curves which can be interpreted as having a sudden change , going into a more rapid decay ( see , e.g. , the left - hand panels in figure [ 4fig ] below for triggers 829 and 6630 ) .",
    "the first important relation between the observables , @xmath6 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , is the correlation between the instantaneous , integrated intensity , @xmath17 , and the hardness of the spectrum , @xmath39 , the hardness - intensity correlation ( hic ) . a common behavior is a tracking between the intensity and the hardness , first noted by golenetskii et  al .",
    "( 1983 ) , who described it quantitatively as a power - law relation between the instantaneous luminosity ( @xmath0 the energy flux ) and the peak energy @xmath40 where the peak of the spectrum was quantified as the temperature in the thermal bremsstrahlung model ( @xmath41 is the boltzmann s constant ) .",
    "the power - law index ( the correlation index ) , @xmath4 , was found to have typical values of @xmath42 .",
    "kargatis et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) , confirmed the existence of such a hic .",
    "special interest has been focused on the hic behavior over the decay phase of individual pulses in the grb light curve .",
    "kargatis et al .",
    "( 1995 ) found a power law hic in 28 pulse decays in 15 out of 26 grbs with prominent pulses .",
    "furthermore , in their study of the decay phase of grb pulses , rs00 gave an alternative description of the hic : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the correlation index .",
    "finally , borgonovo & ryde ( 2001 ) studied a sample of 82 grb pulse decays and found them to be consistent with a power law hic in , at least , 57% of the cases and for these found @xmath45 .",
    "they also found that the power law indices from pulses within a burst are more alike as compared to the distribution of indices from pulses in different bursts .",
    "the second empirical relation , the hardness - fluence correlation ( hfc ) , defines how the instantaneous spectrum evolves as a function of photon fluence .",
    "liang & kargatis ( 1996 ) found an hfc for individual pulses in which the power peak energy , @xmath6 , of the time - resolved spectra decays exponentially as a function of the photon fluence @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the maximum value of @xmath6 within the pulse , and @xmath48 is the exponential decay constant .",
    "the photon fluence is the photon flux integrated from the time of @xmath47 .",
    "the authors found that 35 of the 37 pulses in the study were consistent or marginally consistent with the relation .",
    "furthermore , they concluded that the decay constant is constant from pulse to pulse within a grb .",
    "this view was , however , challenged by crider et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) who dismissed the apparent constancy as consistent with drawing values out of a narrow statistical distribution of @xmath49 , which they found to be log - normal with a mean of @xmath50 and a fwhm of @xmath51 .",
    "this result is probably affected by selection effects .",
    "they studied a larger sample , including 41 pulses within 26 bursts , by using the algorithm introduced by norris et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) to identify pulses .",
    "another approach was also introduced , in which they used the energy fluence instead of the photon fluence .",
    "the two approaches are very similar and do not fundamentally change the observed trends of the decay .",
    "these results confirm the correlation and extend the number of pulses in which the correlation is found .",
    "the exponential was also used by ryde & svensson ( 1999 ) in their analytical derivation of the shape of the time - integrated spectrum of an entire pulse decay , taking the spectral evolution into account .      a major step for quantifying the spectral / temporal behavior of grbs",
    "was taken by rs00 , where the combination of the two correlations , i.e. , the and the as given by equations ( [ hic1 ] ) and ( [ hfc1 ] ) was studied .",
    "neither of these correlations includes any explicit time dependence of the spectral evolution . however , combined they do , as the fluence , @xmath18 , is the time integral of the flux , @xmath17 .",
    "this was used in rs00 to synthesize and find a compact and quantitative description of the time evolution of the decay phase of a grb pulse .",
    "they showed that a _ power law _ and an _ exponential _ result in the decay phase of the pulse following power - law behaviors : @xmath52 where the initial values at the start of the pulse decay are @xmath53 and the number of additional parameters is limited to two , the time constant @xmath54 ( where @xmath55 = n_{\\rm 0}/2 ) $ ] and the hic index @xmath44 .",
    "note that the origin of the time variable , @xmath11 , is at the start of the decay .",
    "the peak energy has a similar dependence as the intensity , differing only in the correlation index @xmath44 .",
    "note also that equations ( [ recn ] ) and ( [ rece ] ) are segments of power law decays with their formal origins of infinite @xmath10 and @xmath56 at @xmath57 .",
    "the exponential decay constant of the , introduced and defined by liang & kargatis ( 1996 ) , is given by @xmath58 , and thus the characteristic time scale of the decay , the time constant , @xmath59 .",
    "finally , calculating @xmath60 gives rise to equation ( 2 ) .",
    "the formulation , given by equations ( [ recn ] ) and ( [ rece ] ) , is equivalent to the two empirical relations , equations ( [ hic1 ] ) and ( [ hfc1 ] ) , both of which have been proven to be valid in many cases .",
    "rs00 studied a complete sample of 83 grb pulses in this context , fitting both of the original two correlations , as well as the new equivalent formulation and found that this behavior is common ( i.e. , in 45 % of the pulse decays ) .    in this work",
    ", we will analyze in detail the cases which do not follow the standard description given by equations ( [ recn ] ) and ( [ rece ] ) . according to the results in rs00 , a pulse light curve that does not show this time behavior",
    "will , by necessity , have a different and/or .",
    "our work was conducted on data taken by batse on board the _ cgro _ ( fishman et  al .",
    "1989 ) during its entire mission from april 1991 until june 2000 .",
    "batse consisted of eight modules placed on each corner of the satellite , which gave full sky coverage .",
    "the modules comprised two types of detectors : the large area detector ( lad ) and the spectroscopy detector ( sd ) .",
    "the former had a larger collecting area and was suited for spectral continuum studies , while the latter was designed for studies of spectral features ( lines ) . for our spectral analysis we used the high energy resolution ( her ) background and burst data types from the lads which have 128 energy channels .",
    "the burst data have a time resolution in multiples of 64 ms .",
    "the _ cgro _ science support center ( grossc ) at goddard space flight center ( gsfc ) provides these data as processed , high - level products in its public archive .",
    "data are available for all the detectors that triggered on the bursts ( often 3 or 4 of the detectors closest to the line - of - sight to the burst location ) .",
    "models of the relevant detector response matrix ( drm ) for each observation are also provided ( pendleton et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the eight modules of batse made it possible to localize the grb , which is important since the drm depends on the source - to - detector axis angle .",
    "we also used the concatenated 64 ms resolution lad data for visual inspection of the light curve .",
    "these data are also provided by grossc , and are a concatenation of the three batse data types : discla , preb , and discsc .",
    "to select a complete sample of strong bursts , we started by selecting the bursts in the current batse catalog , up to grb  000526 ( batse trigger 8121 ) , for which it is possible to measure peak fluxes .",
    "these are approximately 80% of the total 2702 bursts observed .",
    "the reason that the peak flux is not measured for the remaining bursts is data gaps and/or missing data types .",
    "the current batse catalog is preliminary , but bursts up to grb  960825 ( trigger 5586 ) were published in the 4th batse catalogue ( paciesas et al .",
    "the threshold we chose for accepting a burst was that the peak flux ( 50300 kev in 1.024 s time resolution ) must be more than 5 photons s@xmath1 @xmath2 , which resulted in a set of 190 bursts .",
    "this set was examined visually , burst by burst , using the concatenated 64 ms resolution data .",
    "we searched for bursts containing long pulse structures with a general `` fast rise - slow decay '' shape , often referred to as `` fast rise - exponential decays '' ( freds ) .",
    "no analytical function describing the pulse shape was assumed .",
    "the reason for using such a loose definition is to have a sample that is independent of any preconceived idea of the pulse shape .",
    "the whole selection procedure is similar to the one made in borgonovo & ryde ( 2001 ) .    for the time - resolved spectroscopy",
    ", we use a signal - to - noise ( @xmath61 ) ratio of the observations of @xmath62 , which leads to light curves consisting of only a few broad time bins . to perform detailed time - resolved spectroscopy",
    "it has been shown that a @xmath63 is needed ( preece et  al .",
    "we apply this as much as possible . however , since the aim of our spectral analysis on every time bin is mainly to determine the peak energy as a measure of the hardness and to deconvolve the count spectrum to find the photon flux , we allow ourselves to use a lower @xmath61 , sometimes as low as 30 for weak bursts . in these cases , we check that the results are consistent with higher @xmath61 ratios .",
    "this gives us the possibility to study the burst pulses with higher time - resolution , especially for the later time bins .",
    "we need as many time bins as possible to study the spectral evolution . for this purpose",
    ", we adopt the criterion that the decay phase of the pulses should have at least 8 time bins with @xmath64 to be included in the study .",
    "these criteria resulted in a sample of 25 pulses within 23 bursts , i.e. , @xmath65 of the original batse catalog .",
    "this set is presented in table 1 , where the bursts are denoted by both their batse catalog and trigger numbers . in this table",
    ", there is also information on the detector from which the data were taken , the time interval , and the number of time bins ( @xmath66 ) with which each pulse decay was studied ( see also the discussion in   7 ) .",
    "note that the time variable starts at the trigger time .",
    "the central part of the analysis was performed with the wingspan package , version 4.4.1 ( preece et  al .",
    "1996 ) , provided by the _ cgro _",
    "science support center at gsfc .",
    "the spectral fitting was done using the mfit package , version 4.6 , running under wingspan .",
    "we always chose the data taken with the detector which was closest to the line - of - sight to the grb , as it has the strongest signal ( see table  [ tsample ] for the individual cases ) .",
    "the broadest energy band with useful data was selected , often @xmath67 kev .",
    "a background estimate was made using the her data , which consist of low time - resolution measurements ( @xmath68 s ) stored between triggers .",
    "the light curve of the background during the outburst was modeled by interpolating these data , approximately 1000 s before and after the trigger , using a polynomial fit , typically of second or third order .    for each time bin to be studied , the photon spectrum with the background subtracted , @xmath69 , is then determined by using the forward - folding technique .",
    "an empirical spectral model is folded through the appropriate drm and is then fitted by minimizing the @xmath70 ( using the levenberg - marquardt algorithm , see , e.g. , press et  al .",
    "1992 ) between the model count spectrum and the observed count spectrum , giving the best - fit spectral parameters and the normalization .",
    "the spectra were modeled with the empirical function ( band et  al .",
    "1993 ) : @xmath71 where @xmath8 is the photon energy , @xmath72 is the @xmath73folding energy , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the asymptotic power law indices , @xmath76 is the amplitude , and @xmath77 has been chosen to make the photon spectrum @xmath78 a continuous and a continuously differentiable function through the condition @xmath79^{\\alpha-\\beta } e^{-(\\alpha-\\beta)}.\\ ] ]    the power law indices , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , were always left free to vary . the photon energy , @xmath39 , at which the @xmath80-spectrum peaks , is used as a measure of the spectral hardness instead of @xmath72 .",
    "these are related through @xmath81 and a peak exists only when @xmath82 .",
    "the photon spectrum arrived at is model - dependent . however , as the band  et  al .",
    "function ( eq . [",
    "[ band ] ] ) , often gives a good model of the spectra , the photon spectrum found by deconvolving the count spectrum should correspond well with the true photon spectrum .",
    "the fitting procedure then has 4 free parameters : @xmath76 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and @xmath39 . for every time bin , the instantaneous , integrated photon flux , @xmath10 ,",
    "is found by integrating the modeled photon spectrum ( @xmath83 ) over the available energy band of the detector .",
    "we start off by analyzing the light curves in the sample with the non - linear levenberg - marquardt method with the statistical weights given by the observed errors .",
    "the main target of this study is the early decay phases of long , bright pulses .",
    "apart from the discussion in   2.1 on possible changes in the decay rate of the light curve , there are additional reasons to be cautious when deciding which time interval should be used in the study .",
    "firstly , we are studying the deconvolved ( photon ) spectra which often eventually become affected by the limited energy range of the detector . secondly , to achieve the required @xmath61 ratio ,",
    "late time bins often become relatively broad .",
    "the time assigned to this flux data point is in the middle of the time bin , which , in general , is not exactly correct , and thus can affect details in the analysis . the time interval and the number of time bins used in the statistical analysis for each pulse in the study",
    "are shown in table 1 .    as discussed in   2.1 , there is no consensus on what shape the pulse decays of the photon flux have . both stretched exponentials and power law decays have been used to fit the data .",
    "we therefore fit the light curves of our complete sample with the following two general functions ; a generalized power law decay : @xmath84 ( of which eq . [ [ recn ] ] is the special case , @xmath85 ) , and the stretched exponential decay of equation ( [ stretch ] ) .",
    "the results of the fits of the decay phases in the sample are given in tables [ tpowerlaw ] , [ tstretched ] , and [ tphi ] .",
    "table [ tpowerlaw ] ( see also fig .",
    "[ [ 4fig ] ] ) gives the results of the fits to equation ( [ recnn ] ) for every pulse , i.e. , the parameters @xmath29 , @xmath54 , and @xmath20 , as well as the reduced @xmath86 values of the fits . in table",
    "[ tstretched ] , the parameter values , @xmath29 , @xmath87 , and @xmath31 , from the fit to equation ( [ stretch ] ) , are given for all pulses .",
    "the @xmath86 values in these two tables should be judged with some caution due to the reasons mentioned above .",
    "furthermore , overlapping and unresolved , minor pulses , which are not modeled , could also be present .",
    "comparison between fits are still instructive and the overall conclusion is , nevertheless , that the power law function is a better description ( having a lower @xmath86 value ) of the pulse decays than a stretched exponential in all cases but three ( triggers 1085 , 1625 , and 3765 ) . in these three cases , however , the stretched exponential function is only marginally better . in an additional two cases , triggers 973 and 1121 , the power law function is not constrained at all .",
    "both of these cases have a large peakedness parameter ( @xmath88 ) , i.e. , they have an exponential or faster decay , and , in fact , the stretched exponential of equation ( 1 ) provides a good fit .    in figure",
    "[ conn ] , a continuous histogram of the power law index , @xmath20 , found for the pulses in the sample is shown .",
    "the histogram is constructed by summing gaussian functions which have the values of the mean and the variance found from the fits . in this figure , the specific spectral - temporal behavior discussed in rs00",
    "is clearly seen as the peak at @xmath89 . the second important result given by",
    "this analysis is the apparent bimodal distribution of the index @xmath20 , in which there is a second maximum close to @xmath90 .",
    "the width is larger here , since the larger the @xmath20 values are , the larger the uncertainties in the measurements are .",
    "the number of cases are approximately the same ( 11 and 12 cases ) above and below @xmath91 .",

    "the quality of the fits can be judged from the reduced @xmath70 values in the tables .",
    "the reason we chose to freeze @xmath29 , @xmath54 , and @xmath20 was to have a consistency with the light curve fittings in table 2 and as these parameters often could not be constrained if they were free to vary .",
    "the results are also presented in figures [ 4fig ] . here",
    ", the first panel in every horizontal strip shows the discsc data ( all four energy channels are used ) and indicates the time interval studied ( also see table 1 ) .",
    "the second panel shows the light curve with the lad herb data in the chosen time binning . in some cases bins beyond the interval used for the statistical analysis",
    "is shown and indicated in grey ( cf .",
    "table 1 and  4 ) .",
    "the best fit is indicated with a solid curve ( see table 2 ) .",
    "the two right - hand panels , show the correlations , the in panel 3 and the in panel 4 . case ( i ) ( i.e. , @xmath85 ) is represented by the solid line in panel 3 ( the power law ) and the dashed line in panel 4 ( the exponential ) .",
    "case ( ii ) is represented by the dashed curves in the two panels , the generalized in panel 3 and the exponential in panel 4 . finally , case ( iii ) is represented by the solid curves in the two panels , the power law in panel 3 and the generalized in panel 4 .",
    "first , note the self - consistent behavior of the about 10 cases with @xmath89 as was already outlined and studied in rs00 .",
    "for such cases , the power law and the exponential are valid simultaneously .    for the 11 pulse decays with @xmath20 larger than @xmath116",
    ", it could be the case that both the and the are described by completely new functions",
    ". however , it could also be the case that only one , either the or the , is different , leaving the other correlation valid independent of the shape of the light curve ( i.e. , of @xmath20 ) . in the results ( tables 4 and 5 ) , there is such a correspondence , i.e. , if the power law in table 4 gives a better fit than the generalized in table 5 , then the generalized in table 5 is a better fit than the exponential in table 4 and vice versa .",
    "about half the cases point to the power law being valid independent of the shape of the light curve , while the other half suggests the exponential to be the one that is valid .",
    "unfortunately , the correlations are not of sufficiently quality to distinctly favor one set or the other , which is also seen in the two right - hand panels in figure [ 4fig ] .    to check the significance of these results and to find which pulses can with some confidence be said to favor either a power law hic or an exponential hfc , we study the following . for every pulse , the pair with the best fits , i.e. , either a power law hic plus a generalized hfc or a generalized hic plus an exponential hfc , are considered and we reanalyze the generalized correlation ( given by either equation [ [ hicn ] ] or [ [ hfcn ] ] ) by letting the parameter @xmath20 also be free to vary .",
    "the results are presented in table 6 . in 6 out of the 11 cases",
    ", @xmath20 is constrained .",
    "four out of these give @xmath20-values that are the same to within the errors as the values obtained from fitting the light curve ( table 2 ) .",
    "for these cases , the spectral / temporal behavior is consistent and constrained . in the last two cases for which @xmath20 is constrained , the errors in the @xmath20-values are , however , so large that no certain conclusion can be drawn .",
    "the four cases ( triggers 1625 , 3492 , 3765 , and 5567 ) for which the correlations are good enough to be able to draw any conclusions are all consistent with case ( iii ) above , i.e. , a power law ( according to eq . [ [ hic1 ] ] ) and a generalized ( according to eq . [ [ hfcn ] ] ) .",
    "these cases are marked with an asterisk in figure [ 4fig ] and the resulting generalized hfcs from having the @xmath20-parameter free to vary are also indicated in figure [ 4fig ] by long - dashed curves in the right - hand panel for the four triggers .",
    "the hics for these four cases are also found to be described by power laws in the study of borgonovo & ryde ( 2001 ) and they are thus expected to have an differing from an exponential .",
    "in parentheses in table 1 , the total number of bins which were studied is given .",
    "the extra time bins are not included in the statistical analysis but are nonetheless included in figure [ 4fig ] in grey . in these cases , the light curves show details which motivate their exclusion .",
    "this is especially seen in linear plots of the decay , i.e. , when plotting the linear @xmath117 .",
    "this is , for instance , seen for the pulse from trigger 6630 in figure 1 in rs00 .",
    "the inclusion of these data points often leads to a drastic increase in the error of the @xmath20-parameter with , albeit , @xmath20 still being consistent with the @xmath20 from fitting only the earlier decay phase .    specifically , for trigger 3492 , the choice of the fitting time interval is motivated by its appearance in a @xmath118-plot , see figure [ 3492 ] .",
    "the extra bump at 8 seconds could be an additional pulse .",
    "fitting the whole interval out to @xmath119 s with the power law function ( eq.[[recnn ] ] ) gives a very high , @xmath120 .",
    "furthermore , for pulse 2083:2 , only 8 out of the 11 analyzed time bins are used in our study .",
    "the reason for this is the low values of the measured peak energy , @xmath121 kev , which is at or below the actual detector energy window , and should thus not be included in the statistical analysis .",
    "the strange behavior of trigger 3954 could be due to a track jump similar to the ones discussed by borgonovo & ryde ( 2001 ) .",
    "the light curve of trigger 3345 before and after the herb data is very uneven and complicated .",
    "this makes the background estimate very difficult and affects the detailed analysis and thus this case should be treated with some caution .",
    "we , therefore , choose a @xmath122 .",
    "note that borgonovo & ryde ( 2001 ) use a higher time resolution ( and a lower @xmath61 ) and identify detailed structure in the hic .",
    "finally , trigger 7527 was chosen to be studied up to 12 s , for which the power law index of the photon flux decay was @xmath123 .",
    "including the two last time bins , the index becomes undetermined , @xmath124 .",
    "again there is a distinct shoulder in the light curve around 12 s , which can be interpreted as being a result of a change of the radiative regime and , if included , results in the badly determined parameter @xmath20 .    by requiring pulse",
    "decays to have several time bins with @xmath125 automatic leads to a biasing against short pulses with fast decays , and it should be noted that the conclusions of our work are only valid for bright and long pulses .",
    "the behavior of short pulses in long bursts and short pulses in short bursts should be studied to find out whether the spectral / temporal behavior differs in any manner . for this , more sensitive detectors are needed .      for our study of the decay shape of pulses",
    ", we have mainly been using the power law decay function .",
    "however , we have also fitted the stretched exponential function .",
    "we found that the distribution of the peakedness parameter of the stretched exponential function peaks at @xmath126 , see fig .",
    "( [ con_nu ] ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the results of norris et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , who found @xmath31 to lie predominantly between 1 and 2 .",
    "note , however , that there are several important differences between their work and ours .",
    "first of all , we study the pulses in photon fluxes over the whole energy band of the batse detector , while norris et al . studied the photon count rate in the four individual channels .",
    "the pulse shape over the whole spectral range is the sum of the pulse shapes for the individual channels .",
    "we also only study long pulses .",
    "moreover , we study exclusively the decay phase of the pulses , while the norris et al .",
    "study includes also the rise phase using the same value for @xmath31 .",
    "the peakedness parameter thus describes the sharpness of the peak .",
    "finally , our criterion of sufficient @xmath61 in at least 8 time bins for a pulse to be selected probably causes a bias against high-@xmath31 pulses , as these decay too rapidly to satisfy the criterion .    note that the stretched exponential function was invented and used mainly as a parameterization and description of the light curve , and especially for that of the _ entire _ pulse .",
    "we are searching for the self - consistent description of the total spectral and temporal behavior and we have shown that the power law function is valid for most cases . it does not merely serve as a multi - parameter function to fit the light curves , but it is a prediction based on the known evolution described by the two correlations .",
    "a general consideration for a radiative pulse , and also the motivation for concentrating on the decay phase , is that the rise phase describes the energization of the emitting plasma and the size of the activated region , while the decay phase provides information on the cooling .",
    "the different aspects of the behavior during the decay phase of a pulse , demonstrated in this paper , reflects the underlying physics during this cooling phase .",
    "there is , unfortunately no straight - forward physical interpretation of these relations .",
    "there are probably several different processes at action and a competition between these finally decides the details in the spectral evolution .    in the standard fireball internal / external shock model",
    "every individual pulse is identified with a separate emission episode , as a result of a collision between two shells in the relativistic outflow ( or as an interaction with the circum - burst interstellar medium ) in which the ordered kinetic energy of the outflow is transformed into random energy of the leptons which radiate .",
    "the main radiative processes considered for the batse band radiation is synchrotron emission or reprocessing of a low energy synchrotron spectrum by inverse compton scattering .",
    "the main motivation for this is due to the efficiency of these processes and the natural role they play in relativistic shocks .",
    "however , the radiative cooling time scales for these processes are , in general , very short ( see for instance ghisellini , celotti , & lazzati 2000 ) and therefore a direct interpretation of the pulses as a result of an impulsive heating with a subsequent decay is difficult .",
    "rather a continuous acceleration of the leptons , competing with the radiative cooling , could be invoked to explain the time scales of the long pulses studied here .",
    "thus the light curve probably reflects the change in plasma properties , such as the lepton energy distribution . the actual acceleration process which takes place in the shocks is not well understood and is mainly assumed to produce a power law distribution of leptons .",
    "the observed spectral and temporal signatures during pulse decays give insights into these processes .",
    "ryde , lloyd , & petrosian ( in preparation ) study the synchrotron emission and the associated lepton distribution needed to reproduce these signatures , especially the since it seems to be one of the fundamental relations .    as an alternative radiation mechanism , liang ( 1997 ) and liang et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have explored a thermal comptonization model based on the observations of the hfc .",
    "an emitting system that reproduces the observations that the hardness of the instantaneous spectra decays exponentially with photon fluence is the following .",
    "assume a confined plasma that is subject to an impulsive energy release , heating the gas .",
    "assume further that there is a constant supply of soft photons that cools the hot electron gas in the plasma , giving rise to thermal radiation and the radiated luminosity .",
    "with a thermal radiation process , e.g. , saturated comptonization , the averaged photon energy will correspond to the electron temperature .",
    "the cooling of the electron gas then gives rise to the evolution of the peak of the photon spectrum .",
    "the change of the total energy of the cloud , i.e. , the luminosity radiated away , will therefore be proportional to the change in photon energy , if the number of electrons is constant .",
    "this is what is described by the power - law hfc .",
    "equation ( [ hfc1 ] ) gives that the change of the photon energy will be proportional to the emitted flux : @xmath127 .",
    "note that any thermal process will be able to reproduce this relation .",
    "also , as mentioned above , there is a continuous heating , for instance from dissipation of energy through shocks which complicates the picture .",
    "moreover , kinematical and relativistic effects should also be considered .",
    "the dynamics of the actual shell crossing will be affected by the shell widths and the relative sizes of the lorentz factors and densities of the two shells and could contribute to the dispersion in the observed behaviors . and as the radiation is emitted from a spherical symmetric surface expanding at a relativistic speed , with lorentz factors of @xmath128",
    ", light travel effects could become as important as other effects .",
    "this will smear out any direct physical information in the spectra ; see , for instance , cen ( 1999 ) .",
    "if this effect is indeed dominating , the pulse shape will no longer reflect the intrinsic temporal profile .",
    "ryde et al .",
    "( in preparation ) is investigating this issue in detail and comparing it to the observational results above .",
    "finally , as emphasized by rs00 and in this paper , the different aspects of the spectral and temporal evolution are intimately linked to each other .",
    "it is therefore not enough to explain only one aspect , such as the light curve decoupled from the spectral behavior .",
    "the full spectral / temporal description should be tested for in any successful model attempting to describe the prompt grb emission .",
    "we have presented and shown , through the two empirical correlations , the and the , how we can characterize the variety of the decays of long , bright grb pulses .",
    "since the light curve , @xmath10 , is the best determined with relatively small errors ( as compared to the correlations , or @xmath129 $ ] ) and gives the strongest constraint to the fits , we start our exploration from the variety of shapes of the light curve .",
    "this leads us to find alternative @xmath15 and @xmath16 behaviors .",
    "a bimodality could be present , in that there are two preferred values of the index of the power - law light - curve , namely @xmath130 and @xmath24 , with the sample divided into approximately two equally large sets by @xmath91 .",
    "for the large @xmath20 cases , we could identify 4 cases for which the spectral / temporal behavior , i.e. , the correlations , was constrained ( even if @xmath20 was free ) .",
    "these cases suggest that the power law is valid independent of the shape of the light curve , i.e. , there is always the same power law correlation between the hardness and the intensity .",
    "the , on the other hand , is different for different light curve behaviors according to equation ( [ hfcn ] ) , since the fluence is the time integral of the instantaneous flux .",
    "the important relations for a grb pulse decay are , subsequently , the power law and the light curve , @xmath10 .",
    "however , it must be noted that this result should be tested on a larger sample of well determined hics and hfcs to be able to clearly confirm our conclusions .",
    "a catalog of strong grb pulses and their behaviors is in preparation .",
    "we are grateful to the grossc at goddard space flight center for help during our work with the batse data and the wingspan program .",
