    "cosmic rays ( crs ) have been established for some time as the main regulators of the temperature , ionization , and chemical state of dense gas cores lying deep inside the ( far - uv)-shielded regions of molecular clouds ( e.g. goldsmith & langer 1978 ; goldsmith 2001 ; lequeux 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "the association of crs with o , b star clusters and supernovae remnants ( snrs ) where they are accelerated ( in massive - star winds and sn shocks ) has been recently demonstrated for the galaxy ( binns et al .",
    "2008 ) , and even shown for individual snrs ( acciari et al .",
    "2009a ) and star - forming ( sf ) regions ( abdo et al .",
    "2010 ) , while the synchrotron emission of cr electrons is a well - established marker of star - forming regions ( e.g. condon et al . 1990 , 1991 ) .",
    "the recent detections of @xmath23-rays ( the product of inelastic collisions between cr - protons and hydrogen nuclei in the ism ) from the starburst nuclei of m82 and ngc253 solidified the connection of cr energy density to snrs and star formation activity in galaxies ( acciari et al . 2009b ; acero et al .",
    "crs rather than far - uv photons have even been advocated as the _ dominant _ heating mechanism of molecular gas in galaxies irrespective of their star formation activity ( suchkov , allen , & heckman 1993 and references therein ) .",
    "these early proposals however faced two distinct problems : a ) ensembles of standard photon dominated regions ( pdrs ) accounted well for the global molecular and atomic line emission from quiescent spirals such as the milky way ( fixsen et al .",
    "1999 ; mochizuki & nakagawa 2000 ) as well as starbursts ( e.g. wolfire et al . 1990 ; mao et al . 2000 ) , and b ) a tight correlation between co line brightness and non - thermal radio continuum used as evidence for cr - heating of molecular gas can be also attributed to the well - known far - ir / radio correlation .",
    "the latter is established by star formation powering both the far - ir dust continuum and the non - thermal radio emission in galaxies , with far - uv photons from sf sites heating the dust ( and thus the gas via photoelectric heating ) and reprocessed into the far - ir continuum ( e.g. condon & yin 1990 ; condon 1992 ) . the tight far - ir / radio correlation and the close association of o , b stars and snrs ( the sites of both far - uv photons and cr acceleration ) down to individual co - luminous giant molecular clouds ( gmcs )",
    "can then easily account for the observed ( co intensity)/(radio continuum )  correlation without cr - heating of co - bright clouds as an underlying cause ( i.e. the far - ir / radio becomes a co / radio correlation as co luminosity is a good proxy for far - ir luminosity ) .",
    "it was the recent capability for sensitive observations of high - excitation high - j transitions of co and @xmath20co that `` broke '' the aforementioned degeneracies and definitively demonstrated the presence of cr - heated molecular gas in the starburst nucleus of the otherwise quiescent spiral galaxy ngc253 ( bradford et al .",
    "2003 ; hailey - dunsheath et al .",
    "2008 ) , while strong evidence suggests this is also the case for the dense molecular cloud in sgrb2 at the galactic center ( yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "nevertheless these amount to only @xmath60.11% of the total molecular gas found in typical spirals and thus do not change the paradigm of far - uv photons as the main heating agent of molecular gas in ir - luminous galaxies .",
    "it must be noted that irrespective whether crs heat most of the molecular gas in galaxies or not , they remain the ultimate regulator of its temperature and ionization fraction minima , both reached in its densest , uv - shielded , phase deep inside molecular  clouds .",
    "it is the star formation rate ( sfr ) _ density _ rather than the total sfr that determines the cr energy density @xmath24 ( ev@xmath14 ) in the ambient ism of a galaxy .",
    "indicatively , for the 100pc starburst nucleus of ngc253 the latter is @xmath25@xmath26 times higher than the galactic value ( @xmath250.5ev@xmath14 ) even though their global sfrs are similar ( accero et al .",
    "2009 ) . in the central 500pc of the nearby starbust m82",
    "it is @xmath27@xmath18500@xmath28@xmath29 ( suchkov et al .",
    "1993 ; acciari et al .",
    "2009b ) while its globally averaged cr energy density remains similar to that of the galaxy .",
    "such high values of @xmath27 can be easily attained and surprassed over the entire volume of the substantial reservoirs of molecular gas ( @xmath25(10@xmath1510@xmath16)m@xmath4 ) in ultra luminous infrared galaxies ( hereafter ulirgs ) and their high redshift counterparts .",
    "indeed the large ir luminosities of these extreme starbusts ( @xmath30(81000@xmath31m)@xmath3210@xmath33l@xmath4 ) emanate from very small volumes with typical ir brightnesses of    @xmath34    and with most such systems strongly clustering around @xmath35@xmath3610@xmath20l@xmath37kpc@xmath38 , ( thompson , quataert , & murray 2005 ) .",
    "this latter value could be indicating radiation - pressure regulated maximal starbusts ( thompson , quataert , & murray 2005 ; thompson 2009 ) , where an eddington limit from o , b star clusters sets a maximum gas accretion rate onto sf sites deep inside molecular clouds via photon pressure on its concomitant dust ( see also scoville 2004 for an earlier and simple exposition ) .",
    "interestingly a similar threshold value for @xmath39 can be also recovered with crs instead of photons setting the eddington limit ( socrates , davis , & ramirez - ruiz 2008 ) as crs are much more highly coupled to the ism than photons . either way the high @xmath40 values typical in ulirgs seem to be the result of _ extreme starbursts occuring in very compact regions , _ while for less ir - luminous systems ( @xmath0@xmath4110@xmath42l@xmath4 ) ,",
    "which typically have more extended star formation : @xmath43= ( 10@xmath1610@xmath42)l@xmath4kpc@xmath38 ( lehnert & heckman 1996 ) . for nearby ulirgs",
    "this compactness of their molecular gas reservoirs ( and thus of their star - forming volumes ) has been demonstrated using mm and ( recently ) submm interferometric imaging of their co line and dust continuum , that found gaseous disks with d@xmath25(100300)pc ( e.g. downes et al .",
    "1998 ; sakamoto et al . 2008",
    "; matsushita et al . 2009 ) .",
    "moreover , even when such systems initially seem as having larger dimensions , higher - resolution mm / submm interferometry frequently reveals them as mergers of such compact nuclei , each containing the molecular gas of a gas - rich progenitor with m(h@xmath44)@xmath6(10@xmath1510@xmath16)m@xmath37 ( evans et al .",
    "2002 ; sakamoto et al .",
    "2008 ) .",

    "2010 ) . finally ,",
    "while the level of the contribution of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) to the tremendeous @xmath39 values of such compact regions remains a matter of debate ( e.g. downes & eckart 2007 ) , it can be safely assumed that they are good order - of - magnitude `` calorimeters '' of dust - obscured sfr ( e.g. in the archetypal qso / starburst system mrk231 : @xmath0=2/3(starburst)+1/3(agn ) , downes & solomon 1998 ) .",

    "it must also be noted that this gas phase is different from the pdr - dominated gas around star - forming sites that dominates the global molecular line and dust continuum spectral energy distributions observed for ulirgs and often ( erroneously ) used to set the star formation initial conditions in starbursts ( e.g. klessen et al .",

    "the effect of x - rays on the jeans mass of dense cores and the imf has been recently proposed for a powerful distant qso ( bradford et al .",
    "2009 ) and it may represent a neglected but important agn feedback factor on its circumnuclear star formation",

    "this has been noticed in earlier comparative studies of xdrs and regions with higher @xmath27 values ( though only up to 100@xmath7@xmath174 ) found that only carefully chosen line ratios can distinguish between them ( meijerink , spaans , & israel 2006 ) .",
    "the still larger cr energy densities expected in crdrs of ulirgs will further compound these difficulties .    provided that a powerful x - ray luminous agn heating up the bulk of the molecular gas in its host galaxy can be somehow excluded ( e.g. via hard x - ray observations ) , any set of molecular lines and ratios that can strongly constrain the temperature of the dense gas uv - shielded phase ( @xmath175@xmath1210@xmath13@xmath14 ) in ulirgs will be valuable .",
    "indeed , given that in the hierachical structures of typical molecular clouds the dense gas regions : a ) lie well inside much larger ones that strongly attenuate far - uv light and b ) cool strongly via molecular line emission because of their high densities , then any evidence for high temperatures for the dense gas phase would be a indicator of strong cr - heating . in that regard observations of high - j co lines such as j=65 _ and",
    "_ its @xmath20co isotopologue have already been proven excellent in revealing cr - heated rather than uv / photoelectrically - heated molecular gas in galactic nuclei ( hailey - dunsheath et al .",
    "irrespective of the particular set of rotational lines used as a `` thermometer '' of the dense gas , three general requirements must be met : a ) all lines must have high critical densities ( @xmath176@xmath1210@xmath160@xmath14 ) , b ) have widely separated @xmath177 factors , and c ) the j - corresponding lines of at least one rare isotopologue must also be observed ( e.g. @xmath33co _ and _ @xmath20co , or c@xmath178s _ and _ c@xmath179s , etc ) . the first two ensure probing of the dense gas phase while maintaining good @xmath108-sensitivity , and the last one is necessary for reducing well - known degeneracies when modeling only transitions of the most abundant isotopologue which often have significant optical depths .",
    "molecular lines with @xmath180@xmath18110@xmath109@xmath14 ( e.g. hcn , cs rotational transitions ) are particularly valuable since , aside from emanating from gas well within typical pre - stellar cores , they trace a phase whose kinematic state is either dictated by self - gravity ( e.g goldsmith 2001 ) , or has fully dissipated to thermal motions .",
    "this constrains the line formation mechanism ( and can be used to remove degeneracies of radiative transfer models e.g. see greve et al .",
    "2009 ) , but most importantly it reduces the possibility of residual mechanical heating of the dense gas ( loenen et al .",
    "2008 ) that could mask as cr - heating ( as both can heat gas volumetrically ) .",
    "a brief example of such diagnostics can be provided using a large velocity gradient ( lvg ) code ( e.g. richardson 1985 ) to compute relative line intensities for dense gas with @xmath182=(1015)k , and @xmath175=10@xmath109@xmath14 , and @xmath95=(100150)k at the same density . in both cases",
    "a gas velocity gradient due to self - gravity is assumed .",
    "for the cold gas , the co and @xmath20co ( j+1j)/(32 ) brightness temperature ratios are : @xmath1830.7 for j+1@xmath1844 ( j=10 , and 21 are not considered because they can have substantial contributions from a diffuse non self - gravitating phase ) . for the warm gas @xmath185@xmath60.90.95 for j+1=46 , while the corresponding ratios for @xmath186co are @xmath611.3 .",
    "similar diagnostics but using multi - j line emission from rarer molecules ( and their isotopologues ) with much larger dipole moments ( @xmath180@xmath18710@xmath109@xmath14 ) such as hcn and h@xmath20cn can even better constrain the temperature of dense gas in galaxies .",
    "however their much fainter emission ( e.g. hcn lines are @xmath6530 times fainter than those of co ) allows their use only for the brightest nearby starburst nuclei ( e.g. see jackson et al .",
    "1995 for an early pioneering effort ) , and only alma will enable such diagnostics for a large number of galaxies in the local and distant  universe .",
    "strong thermo - chemical effects induced by large @xmath24 values and their ability to volumetrically warm large amounts of dense molecular gas can also provide valuable diagnostic of the temperatures deep inside dense gas cores .",
    "for example global hnc / hcn j=10 brightness temperature ratios of @xmath188=0.5 - 1.0 in galaxies can be attributed to an ensemble of pdrs but ratios @xmath189@xmath1480.5 can not , and imply @xmath108@xmath190100k ( loenen et al . 2008 ) .",
    "such low ratios are indeed found in ulirgs but are attributed to turbulent gas heating by snrs in dense molecular environments ( loenen 2009 ) that substantially warms the gas in the absense of photons to @xmath182@xmath184100k necessary for the hnc+h@xmath191hcn+h reaction to proceed efficiently and convert hnc to hcn ( e.g. schilke et al .",
    "1992 ) . unlike the galaxy where turbulent gas heating has subsided in the dense subsonic gas cores that would emitt in these transitions",
    "this may not be so in the ism of ulirgs , making cr and mechanical heating difficult to distinguish .",
    "as mentioned earlier , moving the crdr molecular line diagnostic to tracers with ever increasing critical densities ( and definitely with @xmath192@xmath3210@xmath109@xmath14 ) may be the only way of `` breaking '' this degeneracy as turbulent heating is expected to become progressively weaker in higher density cores ( after all star formation is expected to proceed in dense gas cores whose turbulence has fully dissipated , larson 2005 ) .",
    "finally , chemical signatures that can uniquely trace the high @xmath27 values in crdrs using the high ionization fractions expected for their dense gas cores are particularly valuable .",
    "a very sensitive such probe of @xmath193 and @xmath194 in dense uv - shielded gas is provided by @xmath195=@xmath196/[hco^+]$ ] versus @xmath197=@xmath198/[co]$ ] abundance ratio diagrams where the high cr energy densities and resulting ionization fractions in crdrs would correspond to very low @xmath199 and very high @xmath200 values ( caselli et al .",
    "a dedicated study of these issues that explores unique diagnostic of crdrs is now in progress ( meijerink et al . 2010 )",
    ".    most of the aforementioned tests will acquire additional diagnostic power once alma will be able to conduct them at high , sub - arcsecond resolution in nearby ulirgs .",
    "it will then be possible to discern whether very warm dense gas with high ionization fractions is localized around a point - like source , the agn ( and is thus due to xdrs ) , or is well - distributed over the star - forming area of compact systems and is thus starburst - related ( see schleicher et al .",
    "2010 for a recent such study ) .",
    "high resolution imaging can also directly measure the high brightness temperatures expected for all optically thick and thermalized molecular lines ( where @xmath201@xmath18@xmath123 ) in crdrs .",
    "radiative transfer models of emergent co line emission from a self - gravitating gas phase with @xmath90=10@xmath109@xmath14 and @xmath108=(100150)k typically yield @xmath202(co)@xmath6(80140)k for j=10 up to j=76 , and imaging at a linear resolution of @xmath203@xmath41100pc ( the diameter of gaseous disks in ulirgs ) would be adequate to directly measure them ( see sakamoto et al . 2008 ; and matshushita 2009 for early examples ) .",
    "for z@xmath2040.05 ( which would include a large number of ulirgs ) such linear resolutions correspond to angular resolutions of @xmath205@xmath60.1@xmath206 ( for a flat @xmath207-dominated cosmology with @xmath208kms@xmath66mpc@xmath66 and @xmath209 ) which would be certainly possible with alma .",
    "the main conclusions of this work are three , namely    * in the high star - formation density environments of ulirgs cosmic ray energy densities @xmath27 will be enhanced by a tremendeous factor of @xmath6few@xmath136(10@xmath7110@xmath13)@xmath29 .",
    "these will permeate the large molecular gas reservoirs of such systems , likely turning them into cr - dominated regions ( crdrs ) where crs not far - uv photons regulate the thermal and ionization state of the bulk of their typicaly very dense molecular gas . * irrespective whether the tremendeous cr energy densities in the compact starburst regions of ulirgs provide the dominant heating for most of their molecular gas or not , they will dramatically raise the gas temperature and ionization fraction _ minimum _ values possible in their ism , which are typically attained in uv - shielded dense gas cores where the star - formation initial conditions are set . *",
    "the new and very different initial conditions for star formation in crdrs _ are an imperative for all high - density star - formation events , _ and will almost certainly raise the characteristic mass of young stars ( and thus the stellar imf mass scale ) during such events throughout the universe .",
    "sensitive observations of key molecular lines with high critical densities ( @xmath192@xmath18110@xmath109@xmath14 ) as well as high resolution mm / submm interferometric imaging will be key tools in uncovering the high temperatures of the dense uv - shielded gas in crdrs expected in compact extreme starbursts .",
    "tracers of the very high ionization fractions expected for their dense gas can provide an independent assesment of their presense .",
    "all these tests will become possible with alma for large numbers of ulirgs in the local universe .",
    "it is a pleasure to acknowledge many informative discussions with drs wing - fai thi and francesco miniati .",
    "discussions with dr marco spaans regarding xdr / cdr potential diagnostics are also greatfuly acknowledged .",
    "finally i would like to thank the referee for his / her extensive set of comments that helped helped clarify several issues and significantly widen the scope of this work .",
