    "genetic repair is an essential component of cellular genomes . without mechanisms for repairing damaged and mutated dna",
    ", genomes could not achieve sufficient information content to code for the variety and complexity of modern terrestrial life @xcite .",
    "genetic repair mechanisms fall into two main categories : those that correct base mis - pairings during the replication cycle of a cell , and those that repair mutated and damaged dna during the growth ( g ) phase of the cellular life cycle @xcite .",
    "two important examples of the first class of repair mechanisms are dna proofreading and mismatch repair ( mmr ) .",
    "dna proofreading is a repair mechanism that is built into the dna replicases themselves . during daughter strand synthesis",
    ", an erroneously matched base is excised , and a second attempt at a base pairing is made @xcite .",
    "mismatch repair also removes erroneous bases from the daughter strand , but does this shortly after daughter strand synthesis @xcite .",
    "two important examples of the second class of repair mechanisms are nucleotide excision repair ( ner ) and the sos response @xcite .",
    "ner protects a cell from damage due to radiation , chemical mutagens , and metabolic free radicals by removing damaged portions of the dna strand and using the other , presumably undamaged strand as a template for re - synthesis of the excised region @xcite .",
    "the sos response is a genomic repair mechanism that only activates when there is extensive damage to the cellular genome .",
    "when dna damage is sufficiently extensive , the cell stops growing , and the sos repair pathways attempt to restore complementarity to the genome @xcite .",
    "the sos response only takes effect when dna damage is so extensive that it may be impossible to use undamaged template strands to correctly re - synthesize damaged portions of the genome .",
    "thus , although this means that the sos repair mechanism is highly error prone , it is evolutionary advantageous for the cell to repair the genome and risk fixing deleterious mutations , than it is to leave the damaged genome unrepaired @xcite .    in recent work with quasispecies models of evolutionary dynamics , quasispecies models @xcite considering the first class of repair mechanisms",
    "have been studied @xcite .",
    "in addition , semiconservative replication , including semiconservative replication with imperfect lesion repair ( i.e. not all base - pair mismatches are eliminated ) , has been considered @xcite .",
    "additional effects , such as multiply - gened genomes , as well as multiply chromosomed genomes , have been considered as well @xcite .",
    "this paper continues the theme of incorporating various details characteristic of cellular genomes by developing a quasispecies model that takes into consideration the sos repair mechanism .",
    "the model is highly simplified , and therefore only a first step in developing proper evolutionary dynamics equations with sos repair .",
    "nevertheless , because our model is analytically tractable , we believe it is a useful and important initial approach to mathematically modeling the evolutionary aspects of the sos repair pathway .",
    "we consider a unicellular population of asexually replicating organisms , whose genomes consist of a single dna molecule , i.e. one chromosome . the genome may then be denoted by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , @xmath6 denote the two strands of the dna molecule .",
    "if the genome is of length @xmath7 , then we may write @xmath8 , @xmath9 where each base @xmath10 , @xmath11 is chosen from an alphabet of size @xmath12 ( usually @xmath13 ) . if @xmath14 denotes the base complementary to @xmath10 ( for the standard watson - crick bases , the pairings are @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) , and @xmath17 denotes the strand complementary to @xmath5 , then @xmath18 .",
    "this follows from the antiparallel nature of double - stranded dna @xcite .",
    "we let @xmath19 denote the number of organisms with genome @xmath4 , and we assume that replication occurs with a genome - dependent , first - order rate constant , denoted @xmath20 .",
    "the set of all @xmath20 defines the _ fitness landscape_.    the semiconservative replication of the dna genomes happens in three stages :    1 .",
    "strand separation , whereby each strand of the chromosome separates to act as a template for daughter strand synthesis .",
    "2 .   daughter strand synthesis .",
    "we assume a genome and base - independent mismatch probability @xmath21 .",
    "this error probability @xmath21 includes all error correction mechanisms , such as proofreading and mismatch repair , that are active during the replication phase of the cell .",
    "lesion repair , where any post - replication mismatches are removed . here",
    ", there is no longer the parent - daughter strand discrimination that was available during daughter strand synthesis , so in contrast to dna proofreading and mismatch repair , lesion repair has a @xmath22 chance of removing the mutation , and a @xmath22 chance of communicating it to the parent strand and fixing the mutation in the genome .",
    "we also do not assume that lesion repair is perfectly efficient , so that we consider a genome and base - independent probability @xmath0 of removing a mismatch .",
    "we call @xmath0 the lesion repair efficiency .    in our simplified model ,",
    "the sos response is triggered if a given genome has at least @xmath1 mismatches .",
    "the replication rate of all cells undergoing sos repair is zero .",
    "we assume that removal of mismatches is catalyzed by an enzyme that binds to a mismatch and then eliminates the mismatch at a rate characterized by a first - order rate constant @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the probability that a given mismatch is eliminated over an infinitesimal time interval @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 .    in this paper",
    ", we will consider the behavior of the model in the limit of infinite sequence length . if @xmath25 is held constant as @xmath26 , then the probability of an error - free daughter strand synthesis is given by @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , fixing @xmath28 in the infinite sequence length limit is equivalent to fixing the per - genome replication fidelity .",
    "finally , we assume that the fitness landscape is defined by a master genome @xmath29 .",
    "specifically , we define a genome @xmath4 to be viable , with a first - order growth rate constant @xmath30 , if it has fewer than @xmath3 mismatches , and if it does not differ from @xmath29 by any fixed mutations . otherwise , the genome is unviable , with a first - order growth rate constant of @xmath31 .",
    "we can develop the infinite sequence length equations for our model , assuming an initially prepared clonal population consisting entirely of the genome @xmath29 . because , during replication , only a finite number of mutations are possible , at any time the population will consist of a distribution of genomes @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 differ from either @xmath32 and @xmath33 in at most a finite number of spots .",
    "thus , given two gene sequences @xmath34 , @xmath35 , if we let @xmath36 denote the hamming distance between @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( i.e. the number of sites where @xmath34 and @xmath35 differ ) , then either @xmath37 and @xmath38 are finite , or @xmath39 and @xmath40 are finite .    as a result , we can define a strand ordering @xmath41 for a genome @xmath4 , where it is understood that @xmath5 is a finite hamming distance from @xmath42 and @xmath33 is a finite hamming distance from @xmath33 .    a given genome @xmath41",
    "may then be characterized by four parameters @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "we let @xmath43 denote the number of sites where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are both complementary , yet differ from the corresponding bases in @xmath42 and @xmath33 .",
    "we let @xmath44 denote the number of sites where @xmath5 differs from @xmath42 , but @xmath6 is identical to @xmath33 .",
    "we let @xmath45 denote the number of sites where @xmath5 is identical to @xmath42 , but @xmath6 differs from @xmath33 . finally ,",
    "we let @xmath46 denote the number of sites where @xmath5 and @xmath6 differ from @xmath42 and @xmath33 , but are not complementary ( for an illustration of these parameters , see @xcite ) .",
    "note that the fitness landscape depends only on @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , and hence the fitness of a given organism may be denoted by @xmath47 , where for our single - fitness - peak landscape we have @xmath48 if @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and @xmath31 otherwise .    by the symmetry of the fitness landscape , and by the symmetry of the initial population distribution",
    ", we can group all genomes of identical @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , and derive the dynamical equations of the symmetrized population distribution .",
    "we therefore let @xmath51 denote the total number of organisms in the population whose genomes are characterized by the parameters @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , and we let @xmath52 denote the total number of organisms in the population undergoing the sos response , whose genomes are similarly characterized by the parameters @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "the corresponding population fractions are denoted @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .      to develop the dynamical equations for both the @xmath53 and the @xmath54 quantities , we begin by considering a genome @xmath41 , characterized by the parameters @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "we first consider the case where this genome is not undergoing the sos response .",
    "then , due to the semiconservative nature of dna replication , this genome is being destroyed at a rate given by @xmath55 .",
    "this genome , however , is produced by other genomes in the population , as a result of replication .",
    "so , consider some other genome @xmath56 which produces @xmath41 upon replication .",
    "this can either occur via the @xmath57 template strand , the @xmath58 template strand , or both .",
    "if the @xmath56 genome is characterized by the parameters @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , then @xmath57 differs from @xmath42 in @xmath63 spots .",
    "because sequence lengths are infinite , the probability of a mismatch in one of these spots during daughter strand synthesis is @xmath64 . in the remaining sites ,",
    "let @xmath65 denote the number of mismatches that are not corrected , and @xmath66 denote the number of mismatches that are repaired , but fixed as a mutation in the genome .",
    "then the resulting genome @xmath41 is characterized by :    1 .",
    "@xmath67 2 .",
    "@xmath68 3 .",
    "@xmath69 4 .",
    "@xmath70    the probability of a given set of mutations corresponding to @xmath65 , @xmath66 , is @xmath71 .",
    "the term @xmath72 arises as a probability that the remaining @xmath73 sites on @xmath57 remain identical to @xmath42 , and the corresponding daughter strand sites are identical to @xmath33 .",
    "the per - site probability of this is the probability of error - free daughter strand synthesis , @xmath74 , plus the probability of a mismatch , times @xmath0 , the probability that complementarity is restored , times @xmath75 , the probability that complementarity is restored correctly .",
    "the degeneracy is given by @xmath76 , so in the limit of infinite sequence length the total probability becomes , @xmath77^{l_1 '' } ( \\frac{\\mu \\lambda}{2})^{l_2 '' } e^{-(1 - \\lambda/2 ) \\mu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    if @xmath41 is generated by @xmath58 , then we have ,    1 .",
    "@xmath78 2 .",
    "@xmath79 3 .",
    "@xmath80 4 .",
    "we also obtain an overall transition probability of @xmath81^{l_1 '' } ( \\mu \\lambda/2)^{l_2 '' } e^{-(1 - \\lambda/2 ) \\mu } $ ] .",
    "it is important to note from the @xmath57 and @xmath58 results that genomes with @xmath82 can not be generated during replication .",
    "since sos repair eliminates mismatches , it follows that a population where @xmath46 is initially @xmath64 for all genomes will always have a population where @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , we may assume in subsequent derivations that @xmath46 , @xmath62 are @xmath64 .",
    "furthermore , note that strands @xmath57 that are a finite hamming distance away from @xmath42 can only generate daughter genomes where @xmath68 , while strands @xmath58 that are a finite hamming distance away from @xmath33 can only generate daughter genomes where @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , we may also assume in subsequent derivations that @xmath44 , @xmath45 are not simultaneously @xmath83 .",
    "then for the genomes @xmath41 generated by @xmath57 , we have @xmath84 , and @xmath69 .",

    "it should also be noted that , by the symmetry of the fitness landscape , we have that @xmath91 .",
    "another way to note this is that , for a given genome @xmath41 , if we change the ordering of the strands so that the first strand is of finite hamming distance to @xmath33 , and the second strand is of finite hamming distance to @xmath42 , then the genome @xmath4 must be represented as @xmath92 , and is characterized by the parameters @xmath43 , @xmath45 , @xmath44 , and @xmath46 .",
    "if @xmath93 denotes the number of genomes characterized by @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , with respect to the @xmath94 strand ordering , then since there is a one - to - one correspondence between genomes @xmath41 with parameters @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 with respect to the first ordering , and genomes @xmath41 with parameters @xmath43 , @xmath45 , @xmath44 , @xmath46 with respect to the second ordering , it follows that @xmath95 .",

    "the sos response continues to undergo sos repair until all lesions have been removed , and a complementary genome has been restored . during every time step , a genome that is undergoing the sos response has its lesions scanned , and each lesion is repaired with probability @xmath214 .",

    "this paper developed a quasispecies approach for describing the evolutionary dynamics of a unicellular population that incorporated a simplified model of the sos response .",
    "the model was a generalization of the single - fitness - peak landscape that is often used in quasispecies theory to study various problems in evolutionary dynamics .",
    "the model was shown to be analytically solvable , and it was found that the solution led to a maximal selective advantage to the sos response in a manner that is broadly consistent with the behavior of actual organisms .    for future research , it will be important to move beyond a phenomenological description of the evolutionary dynamics associated with the sos response , and to consider more realistic models that will allow for quantitative models that can be used in collaboration with experiment . nevertheless , as discussed previously , we believe that even this initial model could potentially be used to understand qualitative aspects of the sos response .",
