    "asteroid families are believed to originate by a catastrophic disruption of large asteroids . to identify an asteroid family , one looks for clusters of asteroids in the space of proper orbital elements @xcite : the proper semi - major axis ( @xmath2 ) , proper eccentricity ( @xmath7 ) and proper inclination ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the orbital elements describe the size , shape and tilt of orbits .",
    "proper orbital elements , being more constant over time than instantaneous ones , provide a dynamical criterion of whether or not a group of bodies has a common ancestor . up to now , ejecta from a few tens of major collisions have been discovered in the main belt ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the size and velocity distributions of the family members provide important constraints for testing our understanding of the break - up process , but erosion and dynamical evolution of the orbits over time can alter the original signature of the collision . it is nowadays well known that the kinematical structures of the asteroid families evolved over the time , with respect to the original post - impact situations , due to chaotic diffusion , gravitational and non - gravitational perturbations @xcite",
    ". these mechanisms changed the original shapes of the families produced in collisions , and consequently complicated physical studies of high - velocity collisions .    unfortunately , most of the observed asteroid families are old enough ( older than 100 myr @xcite ) to be substantially eroded and dispersed . on the other hand , young asteroid families ( younger than 10  myr ) such as karin , veritas and iannini @xcite or even very young families ( younger than 1  myr ) such as datura , emilkowalski , 1992yc2 , and lucascavin @xcite , suffer little erosion during the period of time after a breakup event .",
    "thus , they provide a unique opportunity to study a collisional outcome almost unaffected by orbit evolution .",
    "in this paper we study theobalda asteroid family .",
    "we present its basic properties including the identification of its membership , and the study of cumulative absolute magnitude distribution of the family members .",
    "moreover , the diameter of the parent body has been estimated .",
    "we studied in detail the dynamical characteristics in the region occupied by the theobalda asteroid family and analyzed the role of the dynamics in shaping the family .    as was noted by @xcite",
    "this family is a very good candidate to estimate its age by the method of chaotic chronology ( mcc ) . in order to apply mcc",
    "the family has to be located in the region of the main asteroid belt where diffusion takes place .",
    "also , it is necessary that diffusion is fast enough to cause measurable effects , but slow enough so that most of the family members are still forming a robust family structure .",
    "as we show , it turns out that theobalda family is an excellent case in this respect .",
    "given that , as our main result we have estimated the age of the family . using two different methods , mcc @xcite and backward integrations @xcite , we estimate the age of the family to be 6.9  @xmath4  2.3  myr .",
    "thus , we establish it as another young asteroid family .    the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ s : basic ] we present the basic properties of the theobalda family .",
    "we use the hierarchical clustering method ( hcm ) , proposed by @xcite , to identify family members .",
    "next , the cumulative absolute magnitude distribution of identified family members is discussed , and the size of parent body is estimated .",
    "the dynamical characteristics of the region occupied by theobalda family are presented and discussed , and main mean motion and secular resonances , in that region , identified .",
    "the dynamical stability of the family members is analyzed , in particular the stability of the largest member of the family ( 778 )  theobalda . in section  [ s : age ]",
    "we estimate the age of the family .",
    "this is performed firstly by using the backward integration method , and then by using the method of chaotic chronology .",
    "the good agreement between these two results indicates a reliable age determination . finally , in section  [ s : conclusions ] we summarize our results , discus some possibly interesting relations to other works , and draw our conclusions .",
    "this asteroid family has attracted little attention so far , mainly because the number of asteroids associated with it was relatively small .",
    "however , the situation is different at present , and , as we will show later , theobalda family now has over 100 known members .",
    "this number is large enough that the family characteristics can be reliably determined .",
    "the identification of family members is the first step in our study of the theobalda family .",
    "this is done by applying the hcm to the catalog of synthetic proper elements of numbered asteroids @xcite from astdys ( database as of october 2009 ) .",
    "the hcm requires that distances among the family members , in the proper elements space , are less than the so called _ cut - off _ distance ( @xmath9 ) , which has dimension of velocity . as the cut - off distance is a free parameter of hcm , we tested different values ranging from @xmath10 to @xmath11@xmath12 .",
    "also , we apply hcm using two different _ central objects _ : ( i ) ( 778 )  @xmath13 which has a chaotic orbit , and ( ii ) ( 84892 ) @xmath14 which is on the relatively stable orbit . the results are shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ f : cutoff ] .",
    "the hcm identified the family around ( 778 )  theobalda for @xmath15@xmath16 , while around ( 84892 ) @xmath14 family exists even for lowest tested value of @xmath17@xmath12 . for @xmath15@xmath12 resulting family is the same .",
    "this suggests that ( 778 )  theobalda probably has been displaced from its original position due to the chaotic diffusion . in the bottom panel of fig .",

    "@xmath22[75,115 ]  ms@xmath1 the number of asteroids as well as index @xmath18 are nearly constant , and probably each value from this interval can be safely used to identified family members by hcm .",
    "that corresponds to the center of the interval over which the index @xmath18 is constant @xcite .",
    "] we adopted value of @xmath0  ms@xmath1 to identify _ nominal _ family . for this value of @xmath9 , hcm linked 128 asteroids to theobalda family .",
    "there are two main reasons for our choice .",
    "the first one is that this value of velocity cutoff corresponds to the center of the _ plateau _ which can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f : cutoff ] .",
    "the second reason is very good agreement between the ages of family estimated applying mcc to two different groups of family members .",
    "we will explain this in more detail in section [ s : age ] .",
    "note that the values of @xmath18 for family members are always larger than the value of the same index calculated for background asteroids .",
    "this is the first indication that the family is relatively young . on the other hand , @xcite estimated @xmath18=0.44 for h@xmath22[13.0 - 15.5 ] .",
    "this value is much lower than ours , as we found @xmath18=0.60@xmath40.02 for the nominal family , and very close to the value that we found for background population in the region of theobalda family .",
    "probably , @xcite underestimated this value due to the observational incompleteness , as they worked in the range h@xmath22[13 - 15.5 ] and used smaller dataset for which sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) colors were available .",
    "although they linked 100 asteroids with the family , a significant number of these asteroids are probably interlopers .      to estimate the diameter of the parent body ( @xmath5 ) of the theobalda family , it is necessary to account for small and still undiscovered family members .",
    "in general , data set on asteroids below @xmath23=15  mag is basically complete @xcite . however , as we are dealing with the family at the edge of outer belt , the family members are the c - type asteroids which are several times darker than the s - type asteroids , and , since we are using catalog of synthetic proper elements which does not include all known asteroids , the completeness limit for our sample has to be analyzed .",
    "an indication about the completeness limit can be obtained by simply looking at fig .",
    "[ f : sfd_bw ] for the value of @xmath23 where slopes of two distribution curves change .",
    "this is approximately at about @xmath23=14.5  mag .",
    "somewhat better estimation of completeness limit can be inferred using the catalog of asteroids , which are not included in the catalog of synthetic proper elements we deal with , i.e. the catalog of multi - opposition objects maintained at astdys web site . as about 99 per cent of multi - opposition objects , with osculating semi - major axes in the range [ 3.15,3.20 ]  au , have @xmath2414.2  mag ( see fig .",
    "[ f : mb_ah ] ) , we assume that the catalog of synthetic proper elements of asteroids in this region is complete up to @xmath23=14.2  mag .    in order to overcome the problem of observational incompleteness , using the size - frequency distribution ( sfd ) of the main belt asteroids estimated by @xcite10  km is still poorly known .",
    "various models and extrapolations yield very different estimates of the number of km - sized and smaller main belt asteroids",
    ". however , other possible estimates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would not affect our results significantly . ] and the fact that sfd of asteroid families is considered to be somewhat shallower than that of the background @xcite we added some fictitious bodies with @xmath25[14.2,17.0 ] to the family .",
    "this was performed in such a way to make sfd of  extended  family ( real asteroids + fictitious objects ) , to be somewhat shallower than obtained sfd for background asteroids .",
    "more precisely , in order to be able to estimate the uncertainty of our approach , we generated 100 different sets of fictitious objects and then estimated the size of the parent body from each of the 100 sets .",
    "@xmath5 corresponds to a spherical body with volume equal to the estimated total volume of all the family members , including these added members with @xmath25[14.2,17.0 ] .",
    "next , we assume all family members have the same geometric albedo ( @xmath26 ) as ( 778 )  theobalda , that is @xmath26=0.0589 according to @xcite . having the values of @xmath23 and @xmath26 ,",
    "the radius @xmath27 of a body can be estimated , using the relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath28 this allows us to infer that the diameter of the parent body was @xmath5  @xmath6  km . the estimated uncertainty accounts for uncertainties in albedos , absolute magnitudes and sfd .",
    "also it takes into account the dependence on the hcm cut - off .",
    "however , the real uncertainty is somewhat larger , e.g. because of the possible interlopers .",
    "according to our estimate , the largest remnant ( 778 )  theobalda contains 87 per cent of the mass of the parent body .",
    "although this should be considered as an upper bound , because it does not account for small family members with @xmath29  17 , our result suggest that theobalda family was produced by a cratering impact .",
    "the typical density ( @xmath30 ) for c - type asteroids is @xmath31 kg  m@xmath32 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "given that , the escape velocity  =  1.64  @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the product of the gravitational constant and the parent body mass , @xmath27 is radius of the parent body , while 1.64 is an empirical factor @xcite . ] from theobalda family parent body was @xmath35@xmath3  32  ms@xmath1 .",
    "the dynamics in the region of the phase space occupied by theobalda family members is much like in the case of the veritas family because two families stretch over the similar range of the proper semi - major axes .",
    "the dynamics in the region of veritas family is very well studied ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". therefore , here we will focus only on some differences between dynamics in the regions occupied by two families .",
    "the differences arise from the fact that proper eccentricities of theobalda family members ( @xmath7@xmath30.25 ) are significantly higher than those of veritas family ( @xmath7@xmath30.06 ) .",
    "also , the proper inclinations are by about @xmath36 higher .",
    "these make theobalda family members even more strongly chaotic than veritas family members .    in fig .",
    "[ f : lce ] the lyapounov characteristic exponents ( lces ) , as a function of proper semi - major axis and eccentricity , in the region occupied by theobalda family members , as well as in the surrounding area are shown .",
    "most of the orbits in that region are unstable even for comparatively low values of proper eccentricity , while for eccentricity above 0.3 almost all chaotic zones are connected forming a wide _ chaotic sea _ with a fast diffusion therein .",
    "the chaos is also dominating in the region where theobalda family is located ( inside or close to the equivelocity ellipse ) .",
    "this can be better appreciated from fig .",
    "[ f : tlyap ] where lces of theobalda family members are shown .",
    "the vertical strip of the largest at @xmath2@xmath33.174  au values of lces is associated with ( 5 , -2 , -2 ) three - body mmr , but it seems that this chaotic zone includes ( 3 , 3 , -2 ) and ( 7 , -7 , -2 ) three - body mmrs as well .",
    "most of the bodies have lce  @xmath371@xmath38@xmath39  @xmath40 , which corresponds to the lyapounov times @xmath41 @xmath42 10,000  yr and these bodies are probably in the so - called _ chirikov regime _ @xcite .    using the proper frequencies @xmath43 ( average rate of the perihelion longitude @xmath44 ) and @xmath45 ( average rate of the node longitude @xmath46 ) ) and saturn ( @xmath47,@xmath48 )",
    "are taken from @xcite .",
    "] we found that theobalda family region is also crossed by two secular resonances @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( fig .  [",
    "f : secular_resonances ] ) .",
    "both are of the order 4 , i.e. they arise from the perturbing terms of degree of at least 4 in eccentricity and inclination @xcite .",
    "however , we did not find evidence ( see section [ sss : diffusion ] ) that these resonances increase diffusion speed .",
    "probably this is because these resonances are effective only in narrow bands within the theobalda family has much more influence on dynamics of family members in the case of padua family ( see * ? ? ?",
    "] . consequently , some of the family members , during their secular cycles , might be temporally trapped in one or both secular resonances , but most of the time these asteroids are outside the secular resonances . in fig .",
    "[ f : secular_resonances ] the time evolution of the critical angles @xmath51=@xmath44+@xmath46-@xmath52-@xmath53 , and @xmath54=@xmath44+@xmath46-@xmath55-@xmath53 , for asteroid ( 778 )  theobalda are shown .",
    "this asteroid might be temporally trapped in both secular resonances .",
    "although the short episodes of  libration  are visible , these events may be related to resonance crossing rather then to the resonance trapping . most of the time both critical arguments circulate .    in fig .",
    "[ f : dis_aei ] distributions of family members , as identified by hcm , are shown along with the positions of main mean motion and secular resonances . obviously , the structure of the family is a result of dynamical mechanisms at work , which are mainly controlled by mmrs .",
    "the largest spread of family members , in both ( @xmath2,@xmath7 ) and ( @xmath2,@xmath8 ) planes , is associated to ( 5 ,  -2 ,  -2 ) resonance . somewhat smaller spread is observable in the ( 3 ,  3 ,  -2 ) resonance , while ( 7 ,  -7 ,  -2 ) resonance caused only small diffusion of asteroids .",
    "this agree very well with obtained values of lces ( see fig .",
    "[ f : tlyap ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that there are gaps ( without family members ) between the ( 3 ,  3 ,  -2 ) and ( 5 ,  -2 ,  -2 ) resonances , as well as between the ( 5 ,  -2 ,  -2 ) and ( 7 ,  -7 ,  -2 ) resonances .",
    "we suggest that this is another confirmation that all these three resonances are connected and make one wide chaotic zone .",
    "because of this , all asteroids from @xmath2@xmath33.167  au to @xmath2@xmath33.181  au reside in one of these three resonances .",
    "the asteroids can switch from one resonances to another ( see fig .",
    "[ f:778 ] ) , but on the time scale of a few myr this is a rare event , so that each asteroid spends most of the time in one of the resonances . as a result , due to the some uncertainty in the procedure of computation of synthetic proper elements for resonant asteroids , i.e. averaging",
    "does not work well , all bodies appear to be located in ( or close to ) the center of one of the resonances .",
    "this can be verified by using the analytical proper elements@xmath373.183  au , shown for two different kinds of proper elements .",
    "obvious grouping of the regular members , which is clearly visible in the space of synthetic proper elements ( fig .",
    "[ f : dis_aei ] ) , disappears in the space of analytical proper elements ( fig .",
    "[ f : analytical ] ) . ] of @xcite .",
    "these elements are calculated by means of analytical theory based on the series development of the perturbing hamiltonian , and which does not include averaging .",
    "the distribution of theobalda family members in the space of analytical proper elements ( in the @xmath56 plane ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : analytical ] .",
    "the shown distribution is roughly random and without gaps in terms of proper semi - major axis , what confirms our claim that the gaps appear due to the averaging procedure .",
    "moreover , it means that switching from one resonance to another must be a rare event , but , the fact that not all of the asteroids are located in the center of one of the resonances , is another evidence that resonance switching is possible , i.e. these three resonances are connected .",
    "the position of the largest remnant , asteroid ( 778 )  theobalda , is not close to the center of the family .",
    "this is evident also in ( @xmath2,@xmath8 ) plane , but it is more obvious in ( @xmath2,@xmath7 ) plane . as we already mentioned above",
    ", this asteroid has probably been displaced from its original position due to the some dynamical mechanisms .",
    "it is located close to or inside the ( 7 ,  -7 ,  -2 ) three - body mmr , which might be responsible for its relatively high proper eccentricity . however , its proper semi - major axis is also larger than that of the center of family , and this could not be explained by ( 7 ,  -7 ,  -2 ) resonance . because of that , we investigate dynamics of this asteroid in more detail .",
    "the orbit of ( 778 )  theobalda is propagated for 100  myr back in time . as we will show later , the family is about 6 - 7  myr old .",
    "why than it is meaningful to integrate 100  myr ?",
    "the answer is hidden in the chaotic motion of this asteroid . as we know , chaos is not predictable on the time scales of several times the inverse of lce , which is in the case of ( 778 )  theobalda @xmath38,000  yr .",
    "all that we can achieve is to show what kind of behavior ( i.e. motion ) is possible . in this respect ,",
    "our 100  myr long integrations are equivalent to many shorter integrations with slightly different initial conditions .",
    "similar technique was used by @xcite to study stability of the solar system .",
    "[ f:778 ] shows 100  myr of the back - in - time evolution of the mean semi - major axis of asteroid ( 778 )  theobalda .",
    "initially , its semi - major axis oscillates around 3.181  au ( close to ( 7 ,  -7 ,  -2 ) resonance ) , but after about 15  myr ( in the past ) the value of the semi - major axis drops to @xmath33.174  au . around this time it actually switches from ( 7 ,  -7 ,",
    "-2 ) to ( 5 ,  -2 ,  -2 ) resonance . there is another switch of the resonance about 42  myr , when the asteroid is temporally trapped in ( 3 , 3 , -2 ) resonance at @xmath33.168  au .",
    "finally , at about 95  myr in the past , it went back from ( 5 ,  -2 ,  -2 ) to ( 7 ,  -7 ,  -2 ) resonance .",
    "this is the confirmation that these three resonances are connected at higher eccentricities ( @xmath7  @xmath37  0.25 ) . but",
    "again , due to the chaoticity , the behavior of the mean semi - major axis of asteroid ( 778 )  theobalda does not represent quantitatively its real motion , but qualitatively .",
    "still , behavior of its semi - major axis suggests that chaos may be responsible for displacement of ( 778 )  theobalda from the center of family in terms of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "however , if this was the case , this asteroid probably spend some time residing in ( 5 ,  -2 ,  -2 ) resonance which is strong enough to increase its eccentricity from @xmath7@xmath30.253 to @xmath7@xmath30.259 , on the time scale of several myr .    studying the distribution of family members shown in fig .",
    "[ f : dis_aei ] , it can be noted that there are no family members located inside equivelocity ellipses , at @xmath2@xmath33.165  au .",
    "contrary to the gaps between the resonances , the absence of asteroids that belong to the family in this region can not be explained by dynamical instability or by  weakness  of the procedure of proper elements calculation .",
    "although , a detail study of this problem is beyond the scope of our work , we believe that this may be related to the impact characteristics ( cratering event ) , which  forced  fragments to be symmetrically distributed around the semi - major axis of the largest fragment ( 778 )  theobalda .",
    "backward integration of orbits is very accurate method for family age estimation , which works well with young families .",
    "it is based on the fact that due to the planetary perturbations the orientation of orbits in the space changes over time .",
    "consequently , two angles that determine the orientation of orbits in space , the longitude of the ascending node ( @xmath46 ) and the longitude of perihelion ( @xmath44 ) , evolve with different but nearly constant speeds for individual orbits . after some time this effect spreads out @xmath46 and @xmath44 uniformly around @xmath57 . on the other hand , immediately after the disruption of the parent body , the orientations of the fragments orbits must have been nearly the same . given that , the age of an asteroid family can be determined by integrating the orbits of the family members backwards , until the orbital orientation angles cluster around some value .",
    "this method was used by @xcite to determine the ages of the karin cluster ( 5.8@xmath40.2  myr ) and veritas family ( 8.3@xmath40.5  myr ) .",
    "here we applied nesvorn ' y et al.s method to try to estimate the age of theobalda family . by integrating the orbits of the theobalda asteroid family back in time , hopefully",
    ", we can find a conjunction of orbital elements ( @xmath46 and @xmath44 ) , which occurred only immediately after the disruption of the parent body .",
    "this method is , however , limited to groups of objects moving on regular orbits , which , even in that case , can be accurately track up to 20  myr in the past .",
    "similarly as in the case of veritas family @xcite , only a fraction of theobalda family members satisfies this condition and can be accurately integrated back in time .",
    "also , as was pointed out by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the region around @xmath2=3.175  au is close enough to the 2/1 mmr with jupiter to undergo fast differential evolution of the arguments of perihelion .",
    "this induces variability in the evolution histories and complicates any attempt to determine the age of the theobalda family using arguments of perihelion .",
    "thus , we selected 13 theobalda family members which have lyapounov times @xmath58 @xmath59yr and propagated their orbits 20  myr backwards .",
    "all these members are located at @xmath2@xmath373.183  au . in fig .",
    "[ f : clustering ] the average value of @xmath60 , for these 13 asteroids , is shown .",
    "conjunction of nodal longitudes at @xmath36.2  myr suggests that the theobalda family , or at least a part of the family located at @xmath2@xmath373.183  au , was formed by a catastrophic collision at that time .",
    "the average @xmath60 , at @xmath36.2  myr , is @xmath3@xmath61 , much smaller than at any other time .",
    "this suggests a statistical significance of the @xmath36.2  myr event . in this case",
    ", however , @xmath62 values are substantially more spread at @xmath36.2  myr than in the case of karin cluster ( @xmath62 is @xmath3@xmath63 ) or veritas family ( @xmath62 @xmath3@xmath64 ) .",
    "this is primarily due to two reasons : ( 1 ) at least a few mmrs exist in the semi - major axis range from 3.18 to 3.19  au ; thus , despite the present long lyapounov times of the selected orbits , these orbits might have experienced periods of chaotic motion in the past ; and ( 2 ) all regular bodies , whose orbits can be accurately tracked back in time , are small bodies ( @xmath655  km ) and consequently subject to yarkovsky thermal force , which , even on this relatively short time scale , can produce large enough changes in the semi - major axes , and consequently to affect the secular frequencies in a way that is difficult to reconstruct .    in order to estimate how sensitive this result is on the semi - major axis drift due to the yarkovsky effect , an additional investigation should be carried out . as the yarkovsky induced drift depends on several parameters",
    ", we had to decide the values of the parameters characterizing it . these are asteroid spin axis orientation ( @xmath18 ) , rotational period ( p ) , surface and bulk densities ( @xmath30 ) , surface thermal conductivity ( k ) and specific heat capacity ( c ) .",
    "as theobalda family members are most likely c - type asteroids , we have adopted the following values of parameters : @xmath66  [ w(m k)@xmath1 ] , @xmath68[j(kkg)@xmath1 ] , and the same value for surface and bulk density @xmath69[kgm@xmath32 ] .",
    "the rotational periods are chosen according to a gaussian distribution peaked at @xmath71h , while the distribution of spin axes orientation is assumed to be uniform .",
    "these values are consistent with c - type asteroids @xcite .    next , we made 20  yarko ",
    "clones for each of the 13 regular members , by assigning random values of the parameters , from adopted intervals , to each clone .",
    "then , we integrated the orbits of all clones ( 260 orbits in total ) , but accounting not only for gravitational perturbations , but also for yarkovsky effect .",
    "the initial orbital elements of the asteroids and planets were the same as in the previous experiment .",
    "finally , we checked how the value of average @xmath60 change with different combinations of clones .",
    "we found that the result shown in fig .",
    "[ f : clustering ] is very sensitive to the yarkovsky induced drift , as expected . in a few cases",
    "any significant clustering even disappeared , but in most of the cases we obtained a deeper minimum .",
    "the deepest minimum that we found is related to the clustering within @xmath3@xmath72 at about 6.4  myr ago ( fig .",
    "[ f : clustering ] ) , which is still within the error bars obtained from the integrations without yarkovsky force .",
    "we would like to note here that this high sensitivity of the result on the yarkovsky parameters could help us to estimate the rotational periods and spin axis orientations of these 13 asteroids .",
    "this can be achieved similarly as was done by @xcite for the karin cluster members , but we reserve this for a future work .",
    "although , the clustering at about 6.2  myr within @xmath3@xmath61 is the most significant on the time scale of 20  myr , there is another clustering at about 15.5  myr within @xmath3@xmath73 ( see fig .",
    "[ f : clustering ] ) .",
    "as this clustering appears in the more distant past where we should expect less tight clustering , it is not possible to rule out its significance .",
    "also , to use the argument of perihelions is impossible , because the changes in the semi - major axes , caused by yarkovsky effect , coupled with large gradient of secular frequency ( @xmath74  @xmath3@xmath75  @xmath40  au , where @xmath43 is the longitude of perihelion frequency ) , erase evolution histories of these angles . given that , we believe that , in the case of the theobalda family , backward integration method is not enough to draw a firm conclusion about the age of the family .      in this section we present results obtained by using mcc in order to estimate the age of theobalda family .",
    "this model was successfully applied by @xcite to estimate ages of veritas and lixiaohua asteroid families ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in order to apply mcc",
    "the family has to be located in the region of the main belt where diffusion takes place .",
    "also , it is necessary that diffusion is fast enough to cause measurable effects , but slow enough so that most of the family members are still forming a robust family structure . as our results about diffusion speed suggest , theobalda family is an excellent example in this respect ( see section  [ sss : diffusion ] ) .",
    "the basic steps and the model which we used in our markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) simulations are explained in @xcite , and thus we will describe these here only briefly .",
    "our model simulate the evolution of the family in the 3-d space , i.e. proper semi - major axis @xmath2 and two actions @xmath76 , @xmath77 ( see section  [ sss : diffusion ] for definition of these actions ) . at the beginning of a simulation the _ random walkers _",
    "are distributed in the region which was presumably occupied by the family members immediately after the impact event .",
    "then , at each time step @xmath78 the random walkers can change their positions in every direction , in the 3-d space .",
    "the length of the jump in @xmath2 is controlled by yarkovsky thermal force @xcite , while the length of the jumps in @xmath76 and @xmath77 depend on diffusion speed , i.e. on the diffusion coefficients . at the time step when 0.3 per cent of random walkers leave an ellipse . ] in the ( @xmath76 , @xmath77 ) plane , which corresponds to a 3@xmath79 confidence interval of a two - dimensional gaussian distribution , the simulation stops . the number of time steps multiplied by the time step @xmath78 gives the age of the family .",
    "one of the most important information , which are needed as input for mcmc simulations , are the values of diffusion coefficients in the region of interest .",
    "as was shown by @xcite , to obtain good estimate of the family age by mcc , it is enough to determine diffusion coefficients as a function of proper semi - major axis @xmath2 . this is our next step .    as well as mcc , the procedure of determination of diffusion coefficients , as the functions of proper semi - major axis , is described in @xcite .",
    "let us mention here only its main features and numbers related to this work : the orbits of @xmath805,000 fictitious bodies distributed randomly in the same ranges of osculating orbital elements as the real family members at present , are propagated for 10  myr ; then , the time series of mean elements @xcite for all of them are calculated ; the mean elements are transformed to actions according to relations denotes jupiter s semi - major axis , @xmath81 the mean eccentricity and @xmath82 the mean inclination of the asteroids . ]",
    "@xmath83 and @xmath84 ; next , the family is split in the small cells , in terms of @xmath2 , using a kind of moving - average technique with cell size of @xmath85  au and step size of @xmath86au ; finally , the mean squared displacements @xmath87 , for both actions , are calculated , and the diffusion coefficients @xmath88 , @xmath89 for each cell as the least - squares fit slope of the @xmath87(t ) curve , are determined .    the obtained values of diffusion coefficients @xmath88 and @xmath89 , in the theobalda family region",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : diff_coef ] .",
    "the fastest diffusion is associated to ( 5 ,  -2 ,  -2 ) three - body mmr , but the diffusion is very fast in ( 3 ,  3 ,  -2 ) three - body mmr as well , and these two chaotic zones seem to be connected .",
    "the third chaotic zone , associated to ( 7 ,  -7 ,  -2 ) resonance , is connected to the first two in terms of diffusion in @xmath76 , but not in terms of diffusion in @xmath77 .",
    "this is in a relatively good agreement with results presented in section  [ ss : dynamics ] .",
    "the diffusion is somewhat faster in @xmath76 than in @xmath77 , and while the local minimum near the center of ( 5 ,  -2 ,  -2 ) resonance exist for @xmath88 , similarly as in the case of veritas family ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while there is no such a feature for @xmath89 . in the region",
    "for @xmath903.18  au the values of @xmath91 are practically zero , but there is some diffusion in the @xmath76 . it should be noted here that this might affect age estimation using backward integration method , but not significantly , because the most of 13 asteroids that we used to apply backward integration method are located close to @xmath923.185  au , where both values , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , are close to zero .",
    "the important general conclusion can be drawn by comparing the values of diffusion coefficients obtained for the region occupied by veritas family @xcite to the values obtained here .",
    "two families stretch over the similar range of the semi - major axis , but members of theobalda family have somewhat higher inclinations and significantly higher eccentricities .",
    "the estimated diffusion is about one order of magnitude faster in the region occupied by theobalda family than in the region occupied by veritas family .",
    "this confirms the fact that chaos is dominant at higher eccentricities .",
    "having obtained the values of diffusion coefficients , we are ready to apply mcc to estimate the age of the family .",
    "there are two separate parts of the theobalda family suitable for application of mcc .",
    "these are bodies inside ( 5 , -2 , -2 ) and ( 3 , 3 , -2 ) three - body mmrs . following @xcite who deal with veritas family",
    ", we called these bodies group  a ( 5 , -2 , -2 ) and group  b ( 3 , 3 , -2 ) . as the results about diffusion coefficients confirmed , there exists significant diffusion in both groups .",
    "this gives an unique opportunity to apply mcc to both groups and to obtain two independent age estimates .",
    "a good agreement between these two estimates , as well as with the age derived using backward integration method , would suggest a reliable result .    as the present size of the chaotic zone is a critical parameter in our model , we start with the family as identified by applying hcm for velocity cutoff of @xmath93  ms@xmath1 .",
    "this is probably the lowest acceptable value of @xmath9 in the case of theobalda family . with this cutoff velocity we identified 30 bodies from group  a and 16 bodies from group  b. corresponding sizes of these groups in @xmath76 and @xmath77",
    "are : group  a ( @xmath94 and ( @xmath95 ; group  b ( @xmath96 and ( @xmath97 .    using these sizes of two chaotic groups , for each group , we performed 16 sets of mcmc simulations ( each set consisting of 100 runs ) , by using different number of random walkers @xmath98 ( 2000 or 5000 ) , time step @xmath78 ( from 100  yr to 2000  yr ) and for two initial sizes of the family which correspond to velocities of @xmath99  ms@xmath1 and @xmath100  ms@xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "[ f : dis_aei ] ) . from these simulations we derived the age of family to be 2.5  @xmath4",
    "1.1  myr ( using group  a bodies ) and 7.2  @xmath4  3.1  myr ( using group  b bodies ) .",
    "the obvious discrepancy between two results needs to be investigated further .",
    "the age obtained from group  b is in agreement with what we found using backward integration method , while the age obtained from group  a suggests that the family could be much younger .",
    "also , the discrepancy between ages derived from two different groups , may be an indication that identification of family members has not been good , i.e. the velocity cut - off of 65  ms@xmath1 is too low .    because of that , we repeated all simulations using our nominal family . for @xmath0",
    "ms@xmath1 we identified 40 bodies from group  a and 18 bodies from group  b. in this case , the corresponding sizes of these groups in @xmath76 and @xmath77 are : group  a ( @xmath101 and ( @xmath102 ; group  b ( @xmath103 and ( @xmath104 . from these sizes and the same sets of mcmc simulations as in the previous case , we derived the age of theobalda family to be 6.9  @xmath4  1.8  myr ( using group  a bodies ) and 7.2  @xmath4  3.0  myr ( using group  b bodies ) .",
    "now , the agreement between two results is very good , and also , both results agree quite well with the age obtained by backward integration method .",
    "ms@xmath1 to identify nominal family .",
    "it should be noted here that identification of resonant family members is not straightforward .",
    "too small cut - off , on one hand , may prevents identification some of the real family members . on the other hand ,",
    "the large cut - off could associate some interlopers with family .",
    "this may be one of the reasons for the variations of age estimates obtained by mcc for two different cut - off velocities .",
    "] this , in our opinion , is a very strong indication that theobalda family was formed about 7  myr ago .",
    "the fact , that four out of five , different age estimates , agree well , is the reason why we reject the age of 2.5  @xmath4  1.1  myr , derived using group  a ( @xmath93  ms@xmath1 ) , as a possible solution .",
    "thus , in order to obtain our final estimate of the age of theobalda family , we use four results which are in a good agreement ( see fig .",
    "[ f : age ] ) .",
    "the values of the mean ( @xmath105 ) and standard deviation ( @xmath79 ) of non - overlapping sub - samples , of the same size , can be calculated as :    @xmath106    @xmath107    where @xmath108 is the number of sub - samples , @xmath109 is the size of each sub - sample ( 100 in our case ) , @xmath110 is the mean of @xmath111-th sub - sample , and @xmath112 is the standard deviation of @xmath111-th sub - sample . using eqs .",
    "[ eq : mean ] and [ eq : std ] we obtain the final age estimate , theobalda asteroid family is 6.9  @xmath4  2.3  myr old .",
    "we have presented here a detailed study of theobalda asteroid family .",
    "we found that family now consists of 128 members . by analyzing sfd of the identified family members we were able to infer diameter of the parent body to be @xmath5  @xmath6  km .",
    "however , this estimate is based on the assumption that all family members have the same albedo as the largest family member , asteroid ( 778 )  theobalda . in order to obtain better estimate , the albedos of as many as",
    "possible family members are desirable .",
    "ongoing projects , such as wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) should improve situation significantly in this respect .",
    "the most , but not all , of theobalda family members move on chaotic orbits , thus , giving rise to the significant chaotic diffusion which has been changing the kinematical structure of the family over time .",
    "the study of dynamical characteristics , in the region occupied by the family , showed that three three - body mmrs are the most efficient in shaping the family .",
    "these are ( 3 ,  3 ,  -2 ) , ( 5 ,  -2 ,  -2 ) and ( 7 ,  -7 ,  -2 ) resonances , and they are connected in this high eccentricity region , allowing bodies to switch from one resonance to another .",
    "the fact that some of the family members have stable orbits was the reason why we were able to apply backward integration method to estimate the age of the family .",
    "on the other hand , presence of the chaos in the region occupied by the family , allows to use mcc in order to estimate the age . using both methods , and combining the results ,",
    "we found the age of theobalda family to be 6.9  @xmath4  2.3  myr . given the very good agreement between results obtained with different methods as well as when applied to different groups , we believe this estimate is very robust .",
    "thus , this is another family younger than 10  myr .",
    "this result has several important implications , and some of them we mention bellow .    the young asteroid families are also known to be source of solar system dust bands ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the origin of three main dust bands is known , and they correspond to karin , veritas and beagle family @xcite . also , the very young emilkowalski family is the most probably source of incomplete dust band at @xmath113 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the origin of some less prominent bands , such as so called m / n dust band , is still not quite clear . the theobalda family s young age , and its proper inclination of @xmath8  @xmath114 suggest that it might be a possible source of m / n dust band ( @xmath8  @xmath115 ) @xcite . on the other hand , this dust band was linked to ( 170 ) maria asteroid family @xcite , and more recently to ( 1521 ) seinajoki cluster @xcite . in any case ,",
    "dust band produced by such a young family , as theobalda , should be observable .",
    "the size of its parent body also suggests that it should produce a prominent dust band . if this is not m / n dust band , then there must be another dust band which can be linked to this family .",
    "alternatively , it should be explained why and how this dust band has disappeared .",
    "theobalda asteroid family is located very close to the region where three ( out of four ) so - called _ main belt comets _ ( mbcs ) have been discovered ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as was suggested by @xcite , it is possible that this kind of bodies can be found among the members of other young families , probably many of which waiting to be discovered .",
    "being young and dominated by c - type asteroids , we believe theobalda family is very good place to start .",
