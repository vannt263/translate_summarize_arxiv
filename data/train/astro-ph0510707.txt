    "the spectral energy distributions of the coldest known stars and brown dwarfs , l dwarfs and t dwarfs @xcite , are complex , dominated by broad , overlapping gaseous and condensate molecular absorption features .",
    "the strengths of these features depend on a combination of photospheric temperature , gas pressure and composition ( e.g. , burrows & sharp 1999 ; lodders & fegley 2002 ) , which in turn are related to the effective temperature ( t@xmath3 ) , surface gravity ( @xmath4 ) and metallicity ( [ m / h ] ) of a brown dwarf .",
    "nonequilibrium effects ( e.g. , vertical mixing , cloud coverage ) may also play an important role in molecular @xcite and condensate @xcite abundances . the combined influence of these parameters on the spectra of l and t dwarfs is only beginning to be explored through the study of low mass , substellar objects in young clusters and stellar associations @xcite and ultracool subdwarfs @xcite , although systematic studies have yet to be achieved .",
    "disentangling the properties of t@xmath3 , surface gravity and metallicity is a principal goal of substellar astrophysics .",
    "these parameters can be used to infer masses , radii and ages for individual sources ( e.g. , mohanty , jaywardhana & basri 2004 ) , allowing , in the long term , direct measurement of the substellar mass function ( mf ) and star formation history for field objects in the solar neighborhood @xcite . in the short term , t@xmath3 , @xmath4 and [ m / h ] measurements for young cluster or companion brown dwarfs enable tests of evolutionary models @xcite .",
    "gravity and metallicity effects are particularly relevant for interpreting the spectral energy distributions of the coldest t dwarfs , spectral types t6 and later .",
    "these objects , with t@xmath3 @xmath5 1000 k @xcite , lack the complicating influence of photospheric condensates common in late - type m dwarfs , l dwarfs and the earliest - type t dwarfs @xcite .",
    "they exhibit good correlation between spectral type and t@xmath3 @xcite .",

    "the spectra are also shaped by the pressure - broadened red wings of the 0.77 @xmath7 doublet shortward of 1 @xmath7 and collision - induced h@xmath0 absorption at @xmath6-band , both of which are discussed in detail below .",
    "finer atomic line features , including the 1.17 and 1.25 @xmath7 doublets , are unresolved in these data .",
    "further discussion on the spectral characteristics of t dwarfs can be found in @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and @xcite .",
    "variations in the near infrared spectral features of t dwarfs are generally synchronized with spectral type ",
    "later subtypes exhibit both stronger h@xmath0o and ch@xmath16 bands and bluer near infrared colors .",
    "however , slight deviations to these trends exist , and are apparent when one compares sources with similar spectral types , as in figure  [ fig2 ] . displayed in the left panel of this figure",
    "are the normalized spectra of three t6/t6.5 dwarfs , 2mass 0937 + 2931 , sdss 1346@xmath10031 and 2mass 2228@xmath14310 , overlain on that of the t6 spectral standard sdss  1624 + 0029 @xcite .",
    "while h@xmath0o and ch@xmath16 bands are similar among these spectra , clear differences are seen in the relative brightness of the @xmath6-band flux peak and the shape of the @xmath17-band peak . in particular , 2mass  0937 + 2931 exhibits weaker @xmath6-band emission and a broader @xmath17-band flux peak as compared to sdss  1624 + 0029 , while 2mass 2228@xmath14310 has stronger @xmath6-band emission .",
    "similar deviations are also seen among the three t7.5/t8 dwarfs 2mass  0939@xmath12448 , 2mass  1114@xmath12618 and 2mass 1217@xmath10311 when compared to the similarly classified gliese 570d .",
    "what gives rise to these deviations ?",
    "shortward of the @xmath17-band spectral peak , the dominant absorbers in t dwarf spectra are the pressure - broadened wings of the and fundamental doublet lines centered at 0.77 and 0.59  @xmath7 , respectively @xcite .",
    "these features strengthen with later spectral type throughout the l and t dwarf sequences @xcite .",
    "the broad wings of the alkali lines , induced by kinematic perturbations by other chemical species ( most importantly h@xmath0 and he ) , are enhanced in higher pressure ( @xmath19 ) and higher density atmospheres .",
    "as atmospheric pressure scales as @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 is the optical depth and @xmath22 the rosseland mean opacity ) , higher pressure photospheres ( @xmath23 ) are achieved in brown dwarfs with higher surface gravities and/or metal - deficient atmospheres ( reduced @xmath22 ) . for these sources ,",
    "line broadening theory @xcite predicts the strongest absorption close to the line centers , resulting in steep 0.81.0  @xmath7 spectral slopes due to red wing of the doublet .    the @xmath6-band peak , while molded by h@xmath0o and ch@xmath16 bands at 1.8 and 2.2  @xmath7 , is dominated by another pressure - sensitive feature , collision - induced h@xmath0 absorption @xcite .",
    "the induced 1 - 0 quadrupolar moment of this molecule produces a broad , featureless absorption centered near 2.1  @xmath7 . like the wings , h@xmath0 absorption arises from kinematic perturbations and",
    "is therefore enhanced in the higher pressure and higher density atmospheres present on high surface gravity and/or low metallicity brown dwarfs .    while deviations in the strengths of the and h@xmath0 features have previously been linked to gravity and metallicity variations in t",
    "dwarfs @xcite , figure  [ fig2 ] demonstrates that these features are correlated .",
    "the steeper wings and enhanced h@xmath0 absorption exhibited in the spectra of 2mass  0937 + 2931 , 2mass  0939@xmath12448 and 2mass  1114@xmath12618 are both indicative of higher pressure photospheres ; while the weaker h@xmath0 absorption in the spectra of 2mass  2228@xmath14310 and 2mass  1217@xmath10311 indicate low pressure photospheres .",
    "in contrast , the congruence of the ch@xmath16 and h@xmath0o bands for similarly classified t dwarfs suggests that gravity and metallicity effects for these features are minimal .",
    "the observed correlation between t@xmath3 and spectral type , the latter based on the strengths of the molecular bands , links h@xmath0o and ch@xmath16 to temperature .",
    "however , gas pressure does regulate the atmospheric abundance of ch@xmath16 and h@xmath0o in the principle reaction co + 3h@xmath0 @xmath24 ch@xmath16 + h@xmath0o @xcite , while metallicity modulates both ch@xmath16 and h@xmath0o abundances @xcite .",
    "hence , nearly all of the major absorption features in t dwarf spectra are affected in some manner by t@xmath3 , @xmath4 and [ m / h ] .",
    "to further investigate the physical origins of the spectral peculiarities described above , we have examined a new suite of brown dwarf spectral models that incorporate differences in t@xmath3 , surface gravity and metallicity .",
    "the models , developed by the tucson group @xcite , are self - consistent , non - gray atmospheres incorporating up - to - date molecular opacities as described in @xcite .",
    "the atmospheres are assumed to be free of condensate dust species , consistent with prior modelling results @xcite , following the prescription of condensate rainout as described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also lodders 1999 ) .",
    "modified lorentzian profiles with an ad - hoc , smooth cutoff are used to model the line broadening of the and doublets @xcite .",
    "nonequilibrium mixing effects @xcite are not considered .",
    "a full description of these models is given in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] compares three sequences of these spectral models varying t@xmath3 , @xmath4 and [ m / h ] , respectively . the spectral resolution of the models has been degraded using a gaussian kernel to match the resolution of the spex prism data .",
    "there is general agreement in the overall spectral morphologies of the models and observed data ; however , important discrepancies are present .",
    "most prominent of these is the shape of the 1.6  @xmath7 ch@xmath16 band , reflecting continued deficiencies in the near infrared opacities of this molecule for which only low temperature ( 300 k ) laboratory measurements have been obtained ( saumon et al .",
    "2000 ; however , see homeier et al .  2003 ) .",
    "these opacities also detrimentally affect absorption features at 1.1 and 1.3  @xmath7 , although bands at 2.2 and 3.3  @xmath7 have been found to be adequately reproduced ( m.  cushing , 2005 , priv .",
    "in addition , the line - broadening theory employed by these models predates more recent calculations by @xcite , which predict a sharper cutoff for the red wing at 1.0 @xmath7 , in contrast to the modified lorentzian profile used here which is relatively flat over the 0.91.0 @xmath7 waveband . as a result , alkali opacity at shorter wavelengths in the models is reduced ( note the stronger 0.92 @xmath7 h@xmath0o as compared to the data ) while the 1.05 @xmath7 @xmath17-band peak is more suppressed in the models than observed .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig3 ] shows temperature variations for solar metallicity and @xmath25  cm  s@xmath26 models .",
    "the trends in this sequence reflect those observed in t dwarf spectra as a function of spectral type ; i.e. , strengthening h@xmath0o and ch@xmath16 bands producing more acute triangular flux peaks , and stronger absorption shortward of 1  @xmath7 and at @xmath6-band . the increasing depths of the molecular bands with cooler effective temperatures is largely a consequence of the increased column depth , and therefore total opacity , of the associated gas species .",
    "the middle panel compares surface gravity variations in the t@xmath3 = 800 k , solar metallicity models . here",
    ", spectral variations are strongest at the @xmath17- and @xmath6-band flux peaks , although h@xmath0o and ch@xmath16 absorptions at 1.1 and 1.3 @xmath7 , and the @xmath18-band peak , are also affected .",
    "the @xmath6-band peak is suppressed in higher surface gravity models , consistent with the enhanced h@xmath0 absorption expected in higher pressure photospheres . on the other hand , surface gravity variations at the @xmath17-band peak",
    "do not match the observed trends .",
    "the highest surface gravity model exhibits reduced 1.05  @xmath7 flux relative to 1.27  @xmath7 , contrary to the brighter and broadened @xmath17-band peaks seen in the empirical data .",
    "we attribute this discrepancy to the outdated alkali line broadening profile employed in these models , and leave analysis of this feature to a future study .",
    "the similarity of surface gravity modulations of the @xmath6-band flux peak in the theoretical models to variations in the spectral data shown in figure  [ fig2 ] is highlighted in figure  [ fig4 ] , which shows a similar sequence of t6/t6.5 and t7.5/t8 dwarfs but overlain on the t@xmath3 = 1000 and 800 k solar metallicity models , respectively .",
    "inequities in the 1.6  @xmath7 ch@xmath16 band notwithstanding , the spectral models reproduce reasonably well the relative variations observed in the @xmath6-band flux peaks , although both 2mass  0937 + 2931 and 2mass  0939 - 2448 exhibit stronger @xmath6-band suppression than the highest surface gravities permitted by the models .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig3 ] compares metallicity effects at fixed surface gravity ( @xmath27 ) and temperature ( t@xmath3 = 800 k ) for [ m / h ] = 0 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the higher surface gravity examined here is appropriate for old brown dwarf members of the metal - poor galactic thick disk and halo populations .",
    "spectral variations are far more extreme in this case .",
    "the @xmath6-band peak is suppressed at lower metallicities , as expected for enhanced h@xmath0 absorption . at the same time",
    ", emergent flux appears to be relatively enhanced shortward of 1  @xmath7 , due to reduced na and k abundances and their corresponding opacities .",
    "the specific shape of the spectrum at these wavelengths should be treated with caution , however , given the older line broadening theory used in the models .",
    "shifts in the @xmath10- and @xmath18-band peak wavelengths are due to reduced h@xmath0o abundances and increased collision - induced h@xmath0 absorption extending into the @xmath18-band .",
    "overall , these spectral variations are more substantial than those seen in the empirical data , a sign that significant subsolar metallicities ( [ m / h ] @xmath30 ) are not present among the t dwarfs examined here . however , the broadened @xmath17-band peaks and strong @xmath6-band suppression in the spectra of 2mass  0937 + 2931 , 2mass  0939@xmath12448 and 2mass  1114@xmath12618 do hint at slightly subsolar metallicities for these sources .",
    "the spectral models confirm that the pressure - sensitive h@xmath0 and absorptions are more strongly influenced by surface gravity effects than the absorption bands of h@xmath0o and ch@xmath16 , while the latter vary more strongly with t@xmath3 , at least for the temperature regime considered here . by contrasting the strengths of these features",
    ", it should be possible in principle to extract the effective temperatures and surface gravities of these objects . in practice , this pursuit has proven problematic due to persistent inadequacies in molecular opacities and corresponding systematic errors in the models ( e.g. , burgasser et al .",
    "what is required is a means of calibrating the spectral models using one or more empirical fiducials .",
    "fortunately , such a fiducial exists in the t dwarf gliese 570d @xcite .",
    "this widely - separated ( @xmath31 = 258@xmath32 = 1530 au ) , common proper motion brown dwarf companion to the nearby ( 5.91@xmath330.06 pc ; esa 1997 ) gliese  570abc system has both distance and luminosity measurements that are empirically well constrained .",
    "the age of this system is estimated to be 25  gyr based on a comparison of age , activity and kinematic relations for the k and m stellar components @xcite .",
    "the k4  v primary has a near - solar metallicity ( [ fe / h ] = 0.000.16 ; feltzing & gustafsson 1998 ; thoren & feltzing 2000 ; allende prieto & lambert 2000 ) .",
    "assuming coevality , gliese  570d is one of the few t dwarfs with both age and metallicity constraints .",

    "using gliese  570d as our empirical fiducial , our procedure was then as follows .",
    "the strengths of the major h@xmath0o bands and relative fluxes of the spectral peaks were measured for both the empirical data sample and theoretical models using the following ratios : @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the integrated flux between wavelengths @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( in microns ) .",
    "the first two ratios are identical to those defined for the near infrared classification of t dwarfs ; the spectral region sampled by these is shown in figure  5 of ( * ? ? ?",

    "both ratios vary according to differences in t@xmath3 and @xmath9 , although gravity variations are stronger in the @xmath46 color ratio",
    ". gravity variations also affect the two ratios in opposite ways ; higher gravity models yield large h@xmath0o@xmath47 values ( implying weaker absorption ) and smaller @xmath46 values ( implying weaker @xmath6-band emission ) .",
    "similar trends are seen with the h@xmath0o@xmath48 and @xmath44 ratios , respectively .",
    "all of these trends are consistent with the qualitative properties of the model spectra shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "calibration of the model ratios was achieved by correcting these values to those measured from the spex spectrum of gliese 570d .",
    "adopting t@xmath3 = 800 k and @xmath9 = 5.1 for this source , we computed the corresponding model ratios by linear interpolation .",
    "correction factors , listed at the bottom of table  [ tab : ratios ] , were defined as the ratio of the spectral data measurement to the model value . for four of the ratios ,",
    "model values differ by less than 20% ; the h@xmath0o@xmath48 index , on the other hand , requires a 60% correction .",
    "the correction factors were applied to all of the solar metallicity model ratios , regardless of t@xmath3 or gravity , and therefore represents a first order calibration of the models .    in principle , any of the ratios defined in eqns .",
    "15 could be used for comparison to the spectral data .",
    "we restrict our primary analysis to the h@xmath0o@xmath47 index , which requires a smaller correction factor than h@xmath0o@xmath48 ; and the @xmath46 index , which gives a quantitative measure of the behavior demonstrated in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the corrected model ratios were resampled in steps of 20 k in t@xmath3 and 0.1 dex in @xmath9 by linear interpolation .",
    "then , for each spectrum , we identified the region in t@xmath3 and @xmath9 phase space for which the corrected model ratios agreed with the empirical ratios , assuming a 10% uncertainty ( see @xmath8  4.3 ) .",

    "this object has also been noted for its strong @xmath6-band suppression @xcite .",
    "our analysis represents the first quantitative constraints of metallicity for a brown dwarf , and are consistent with prior qualitative conclusions .",
    "however , the derived values should be treated with caution for reasons other than the fidelity of the theoretical models .",
    "constraining the three parameters t@xmath3 , @xmath4 and [ m / h ] can not be done unambiguously using only two spectral ratios ; at least one additional constraint is required .",
    "a promising candidate is the @xmath45 ratio , as the metal - poor models shown in figure  [ fig5 ] exhibit significant variations at these short wavelengths .",
    "we defer more thorough examination of this third index until such time as the current generation of spectral models incorporate a more rigorous line broadening theory .",
    "while the t@xmath3 and @xmath9 estimates made here are reasonable and generally consistent with prior work , it is important to identify and characterize any source of systematic error that may skew the results .",
    "such systematic effects can arise from the calibration or quality of the spectral data , the choice and calibration of the spectral ratios used and limitations of the spectral models themselves .",
    "we examine these effects here in detail .",
    "accurate measurement of color ratios such as @xmath46 assumes that the spectral data portrays the true color of the source , which brings into question possible reddening of the observed spectrum and the accuracy of the overall flux calibration .",
    "interstellar reddening can generally be ruled out for our sample as all of the sources lie at distances of @xmath5520 pc or less .",
    "a more local source of reddening , differential color refraction through our atmosphere , has been mitigated by observing the sources with the slit aligned at the parallactic angle .",
    "we therefore assume that both of these effects are negligible .",
    "systematic errors incurred in the flux calibration can be quantified by comparing spectrophotometric colors for the data to published photometry .",
    "we examined @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 colors on the mauna kea observatory system ( mko ; simons & tokunaga 2002 ; tokunaga , simons & vacca 2002 ) using photometry from @xcite ; and @xcite ; and @xmath56 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 colors from 2mass ( table  [ tab : sample ] ) .",
    "spectrophotometric colors were determined by integrating the appropriate filter profile ( combined with telescope and instrumental optical response curves for 2mass photometry ; see @xmath8  iii.1.b.i in cutri et al .",
    "2003 ) over the near infrared spectra of each t dwarf and that of the a0 v star vega ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also stephens & leggett 2003 ) .",
    "we found no systematic differences for any of the photometric and spectrophotometric colors on both systems , and typical deviations were 5% or less for the more accurate mko photometry .",
    "for those few sources with color offsets significantly greater than their photometric uncertainties ( 2mass  0243@xmath12453 , 2mass  0727 + 1710 and sdss  1758 + 4633 have 3@xmath61 deviations in mko @xmath58 ) , differences were at most 15% .",
    "hence , we conclude that the 10% uncertainties adopted for the color ratios adequately compensates for uncertainties in the flux calibration .      molecular band ratios are generally insensitive to color errors in the overall spectrum , but deep absorption bands can be affected by spectral noise .",
    "this is manifested by variations in the measured flux at the bottom of the bands where signal - to - noise ( s / n ) is minimal . to explore the impact of this effect",
    ", we performed a monte carlo experiment , measuring the h@xmath0o@xmath47 ratio on the combined spectrum of gliese  570d plus a gaussian noise component scaled to s / n = 10200 at the @xmath10-band peak .",
    "a total of 10  000 trials were run over a uniform range of s / n .",
    "we found no systematic deviations in the h@xmath0o@xmath47 ratios for s / n @xmath2 10 , but scatter among the values increased in the noisier spectra , approaching 10% for s / n = 40 .",
    "all of our spectra have s / n @xmath2 50 at the @xmath10-band peak with the exception of sdss  1110 + 0116 , which has s / n @xmath62 20 .",
    "hence , we find that our adopted 10% uncertainties for the measured h@xmath0o ratios incorporate noise effects sufficiently , although derived values for sdss  1110 + 0116 may be more uncertain .",
    "the use of the h@xmath0o@xmath47 and @xmath46 ratios in our analysis above was justified by the sensitivity of these ratios to t@xmath3 and @xmath4 variations in the models , the magnitude of the calibration correction required and the fidelity of the models in these spectral regions .",
    "however , we can also consider how the results change if a different set of ratios are employed .",
    "we repeated our analysis with four pairings among the h@xmath0o@xmath47 , h@xmath0o@xmath48 , @xmath46 and @xmath44 ratios .",
    "again , we found no significant or systematic differences in the derived t@xmath3 and @xmath9 values amongst our sample , although parameters for individual sources differed by as much as 160  k and 0.6  dex , respectively .",
    "typical deviations were of order 65  k in t@xmath3 and 0.15  dex in @xmath9 , which we adopt as estimates of systematic uncertainty .",
    "the calibration of the spectral ratios hinges largely on the assumed physical properties for our calibrator source gliese  570d . but",
    "how sensitive are the results to these adopted parameters ? by varying the assumed t@xmath3 and @xmath9 for gliese  570d by @xmath3325  k and @xmath330.1 dex , respectively , consistent with the range of values found by @xcite , we found mean offsets of @xmath3335  k and @xmath330.1 dex in the derived parameters for the field sources .",
    "these offsets were independent ; changing the adopted t@xmath3 of gliese  570d had no impact on the derived surface gravities , and vice versa .",
    "hence , we estimate that additional systematic uncertainties of 35  k and 0.1  dex in t@xmath3 and @xmath9 , respectively , accommodate uncertainties in the physical parameters of our comparison source .",
    "many of the potential systematic effects involving the choice and calibration of the spectral ratios would be eliminated if the models accurately reproduced the observed spectra . as limitations in the opacities prevent this , we must also consider how dependent our results are on the choice of spectral models used .",
    "we therefore repeated our analysis using the cond models of @xcite .",
    "calibration of the spectral ratios was performed in the same manner as with the tucson models , yielding somewhat different correction values . while deviations typically of order 50  k and 0.1  dex were found when comparing derived t@xmath3 and @xmath9 between the model sets , these deviations were not systematic .",
    "hence , we conclude that the choice of spectral model does not systematically change our results .    in summary",
    ", we find no systematic deviations in our method that would lead to skewed estimates of t@xmath3 and @xmath9 , although systematic uncertainties of order 50100  k and 0.10.25  dex may be present .",
    "according to brown dwarf evolutionary theory , the temperature and surface gravity of a brown dwarf at a given time is directly related to its mass and age assuming a given composition .",
    "this implies that if t@xmath3 and @xmath4 are known , estimates for the latter , more fundamental physical properties could be derived on an individual basis .",
    "this is demonstrated graphically in figure  [ fig9 ] , which compares the derived t@xmath3 and @xmath9 values for 14 of our sources ( excluding 2mass  0939@xmath12448 and 2mass  1114@xmath12618 ) to solar metallicity evolutionary models from @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab : mass ] lists the range of masses and ages , and the corresponding radii , derived from this comparison .",
    "our sample appears to span a broad range of masses ( 0.020.07 m@xmath63 ) and ages ( @xmath64110 gyr ) , consistent with a random sample drawn from the local galactic environment . at late ages ,",
    "brown dwarf radii are fairly constant , so mass and surface gravity are almost directly related . hence , our lowest ( highest ) surface gravity objects are also the least ( most ) massive and youngest ( oldest ) .",
    "note in particular the placement of 2mass  0937 + 2931 , which appears to be the most massive and oldest in the sample . on the other hand",
    ", our analysis suggests that the low surface gravity t dwarfs sdss  1758 + 4633 and 2mass  2228@xmath14310 may have masses less than 0.03 m@xmath63 and ages less than 1 gyr .",
    "how reliable are these estimates ?",
    "an independent check of the derived ages can be made by examining the kinematics of our sample .",
    "three dimensional space velocities have not yet been measured for the t dwarfs examined here ; a rough analysis can be made , however , by examining their tangential velocities , @xmath65 .",
    "of the 14 sources in our sample with age estimates , 13 have proper motion measurements and eight have parallax measurements . for 2mass  0034 + 0523 , 2mass  0050@xmath13322 ,",
    "2mass  1231 + 0847 and 2mass  2228@xmath14310 we adopted spectrophotometric distance estimates from @xcite and @xcite ; a distance for sdss  1110 + 0116 was estimated using absolute mko @xmath66 and @xmath67 magnitude / spectral type relations from @xcite . dividing the 13 t dwarfs into those with mean estimated ages less than 2 gyr ( young ) and older than 2 gyr ( old ) , we computed the mean ( @xmath68 ) and standard deviation ( @xmath69 ) for each age group . for the young sources , @xmath68 = 38 km s@xmath14 and @xmath69 = 20 km s@xmath14 ,",
    "while for the old sources @xmath68 = 51 km s@xmath14 and @xmath69 = 31 km s@xmath14 .",
    "the larger mean motion and greater scatter in velocities for the latter group is consistent with an older mean age .",
    "however , a rigorous examination of the three dimensional velocities is required before a conclusive assessment can be made .",
    "the masses and ages of the objects in our sample as derived from the evolutionary models appear to be reasonable and consistent with their overall properties .",
    "however , these values must be considered with caution as they are susceptible to systematic errors in both the atmosphere _ and _ interior models .",
    "disagreements in mass and radius estimates between these two types of models have been suggested in a few young systems ( * ? ? ?",
    "* however , see luhman , stauffer & mamajek 2005 ) , and such systematic deviations may be present at late ages as well .",
    "fortunately , masses and radii can be determined independently of the evolutionary models for those brown dwarfs with bolometric luminosity measurements , as follows .",
    "the surface gravity of a solid body , @xmath70 , is applicable for brown dwarf photospheres since the vertical scaleheight of this region ( a few km ; griffith & yelle 1999 ) is insignificant compared to the radius of the brown dwarf itself ( @xmath710.1  r@xmath72 km ) . combining this with the definition of t@xmath3 , @xmath73 , yields @xmath74 and @xmath75 these equations rely only on the t@xmath3 and @xmath4 values obtained from the spectral models and the measured luminosities , and not on any evolutionary model ( c.f . , mohanty , jayawardhana & basri 2004 )    luminosities for field brown dwarfs have been compiled by a number of studies @xcite ; here we focus on the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "seven of the t dwarfs in our sample have luminosity determinations from these studies ; golimowski et al .  also adopt the t@xmath3 and @xmath9 determinations of gliese  570d from @xcite .",
    "the corresponding masses and radii derived from eqns .  [ eqn : m ] and  [ eqn : r ] , and listed in table  [ tab : mass ] , generally agree with those derived from the evolutionary models .",
    "figure  [ fig10 ] shows a comparison of mass and radius values derived from the vrba et al .",
    "luminosities to the @xcite theoretical isochrones . with the exception of sdss  1346@xmath100310031 could arise if the source is an unresolved binary , although systematic effects can not be ruled out .",
    "] , derived values lie between the 1 and 10 gyr isochrones , as expected for a galactic disk sample .",
    "more importantly , features in the theoretical brown dwarf mass - radius relationship are reproduced , including the radius minimum of 0.08  r@xmath63 for larger masses and the trend toward larger radii for lower mass brown dwarfs @xcite .",
    "these agreements are promising , and suggest that brown dwarf evolutionary tracks are robust at late ages .",
    "are these values truly independent of the evolutionary models ? not entirely , since the t@xmath3 and @xmath9 determinations hinge on the adopted values for gliese  570d , which themselves are partly dependent on the evolutionary models .",
    "t@xmath3 was derived for this source by @xcite using the integrated observed flux ( over 0.832.52  @xmath7 ) , a bolometric correction determined from _ spectral _ models ( but consistent with more recent empirical determinations ; golimowski et al .",
    "2004 ) , the measured parallax of the gliese  570 system , and a radius adopted from evolutionary models . in the last case , the radii of brown dwarfs at the age of gliese  570d are predicted to be roughly constant , varying by less than 20% for masses of 0.020.07  m@xmath63 ; are determined by well - understood interior physics ; and have been empirically tested at the low - mass end with transiting extrasolar planets ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hence , t@xmath3 for gliese  570d can be considered to be empirically robust .",
    "its surface gravity , on the other hand , was derived solely from evolutionary theory .",
    "however , given the largely constant radii of old brown dwarfs ( r @xmath62 0.1  r@xmath63 ) , and assuming a mass in the brown dwarf range ( 0.020.07  m@xmath63 ) yields @xmath76 cm  s@xmath26 , consistent with the adopted model - dependent value .",
    "hence , the adopted t@xmath3 and @xmath9 for gliese  570d are only weakly tied to evolutionary models , so that the derived parameters for other t dwarfs can provide , at mimimum , semiempirical tests of these models .",
    "two of the objects in our sample , 2mass  0415@xmath10935 and 2mass",

    "luminosities yield values consistent with the models .",
    "this is intriguing , since both 2mass  0415@xmath10935 and 2mass  0937 + 2931 have measured @xmath77-band photometry , and the corresponding luminosities from golimowski et al .",
    "are expected to be more accurate .",
    "these deviations may indicate systematic errors in the luminosity determinations of either golimowski et al .  or vrba et al . , or in our t@xmath3 and surface gravity estimates .",
    "this is not entirely unexpected for the apparently metal - poor t dwarf 2mass  0937 + 2931 .",
    "however , in order to assess the origin of these deviations , and whether they actually indicate problems in the evolutionary models , the number and quality of luminosity measurements for low temperature t dwarfs must clearly be improved .",
    "disentangling the parameters t@xmath3 and @xmath4 for t dwarf spectra enables a more refined examination of the t@xmath3/spectral type relation for these objects , a useful function for constraining atmospheric properties as well as distance estimation . typically , these relations are tied to luminosity measurements and an assumed radius , or range of radii for sources with unknown ages @xcite .",
    "studies have shown that late - type t dwarfs with identical spectral types can exhibit significant differences in their estimated t@xmath3s .",
    "we formally recognize this as the additional influence of surface gravity .",
    "figure  [ fig11 ] compares the derived t@xmath3s for the sources in our sample to their spectral types .",
    "objects with low and moderate surface gravities , @xmath78 , exhibit a tight trend of decreasing t@xmath3 with increasing spectral type , largely consistent with the @xcite t@xmath3/spectral type relation .",
    "higher surface gravity objects , in particular 2mass  0034 + 0523 and 2mass  0937 + 2931 , have t@xmath3s that are 150250  k cooler for their spectral types . this behavior can be understood by the interplay between t@xmath3 and @xmath4 on the major h@xmath0o bands , the depths of which determine in part t spectral types .",
    "t dwarfs with higher surface gravities have weaker h@xmath0o bands , and hence earlier spectral types , at a given t@xmath3 ; consequently , they would appear to have lower t@xmath3s for a given spectral type .",
    "this gravity trend is also present when comparing luminosities , as the oldest , most massive brown dwarfs ( which have the highest surface gravities ) can have radii that are 10 - 15% smaller than 13  gyr brown dwarfs @xcite .",
    "coupled with 1020% lower t@xmath3s , old brown dwarfs can be up to three times fainter than their younger field counterparts .",
    "this is precisely the deviation @xcite finds in the luminosity of 2mass  0937 + 2931 as compared to other t6 dwarfs ( golimowski et al .",
    "2004 find a somewhat smaller deviation ) .",
    "hence , luminosity and/or t@xmath3 measurements for a consistently classified sample could provide a means of segregating young and old systems .",
    "the method outlined here is in some sense a response to the current limitations of the spectral models .",
    "as the models improve in accuracy , direct spectral comparisons should eventually be sufficient to determine the physical parameters of field brown dwarfs .",
    "on the other hand , our spectral index comparison method could also be improved by using additional empirical calibrators such as gliese  570d .",
    "additional calibrators would enable higher order corrections to the model ratios , reducing systematic effects .",
    "such empirical constraints can be taken one step further : a sufficiently sampled parameter space of calibrator sources could enable the determination of t@xmath3 and @xmath4 values _ independent of the spectral models_. to do this , several more companion brown dwarfs with independent age and metallicity determinations , and/or binary ( particularly eclipsing ) systems with measured orbital parameters , are required . while gliese  570d is currently the only such calibrator source in the late t dwarf regime , three closely - separated late - type t dwarf binaries have been identified for which mass measurements are feasible ( * ? ? ?",
    "* burgasser et al .  in prep . ) ; and one t dwarf binary , epsilon indi bab @xcite is also a companion to a nearby 0.82  gyr k5 v star .",
    "there are also several ongoing searches for wide brown dwarf companions to nearby and young stars ( e.g. , chauvin et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 ; neuhuser et al .",
    "identification of several such calibration stars would provide an empirical ladder for determining the physical properties of field brown dwarfs , and a critical test for both spectral and evolutionary models .",
    "can we also extend this technique to earlier spectral types ; e.g. , l dwarfs and early - type t dwarfs ?",
    "in these regimes , spectral energy distributions are strongly affected by photospheric condensates , giving rise to what many consider to be a fourth `` dust '' parameter ( e.g. , @xmath79 in @xcite and @xcite ; t@xmath80 in @xcite ; @xmath81 in @xcite ) which may vary with the photospheric gas properties or other secondary effects , such as rotation . in principle",
    ", the method outlined here could be extended into the l and early t dwarf regime by incorporating this fourth parameter , employing suitable dust cloud models and enlarging the sample of empirical calibration stars . in practice",
    ", this approach may prove more difficult as brown dwarf cloud formation remains a poorly understood process ( e.g. , helling et al .",
    "2004 ) . nevertheless , t@xmath3 , @xmath4 and dust content determinations would be particularly useful for understanding the unusual transition where l and t dwarfs when photospheric dust is rapidly depleted @xcite .",
    "the ability to determine masses and ages for individual brown dwarfs is clearly a boon to statistical studies of these objects , particularly the galactic substellar mf and formation history .",

    "both distributions can be built up directly from individual sources in a sample , assuming that careful consideration is made of selection effects .",
    "while current samples of late - type t dwarfs are too small for a robust analysis of this kind @xcite , searches for cold brown dwarfs from wide and deep near infrared surveys such as the ukirt infrared deep sky survey @xcite may make mf and age distribution measurements feasible in the near future .    in the more immediate term , t@xmath3 and @xmath4 measurements , and corresponding mass and age estimates , are useful for identifying and characterizing young , low mass objects in young star forming regions . according to current evolutionary models , t dwarfs with ages @xmath5  10  myr can have masses of only a few jupiter masses ( m@xmath82 ) .",

    "a calibrated spectral ratio comparison could provide a more robust assessment of the physical properties of this and other low mass candidates , and verify their cluster membership .",
    "furthermore , with luminosity measurements , independent determinations of mass and age would provide semiempirical constraints on the evolutionary models from which mass estimates are currently derived .",
    "such independent assessments are necessary to validate the existence of so - called `` planetary - mass '' brown dwarfs in these young star forming regions .",

    "we find no evidence of systematic effects in our method , and the agreement of our t@xmath3 determinations with prior studies suggests that our results are robust .",
    "we also find that the scatter observed in t@xmath3/spectral type relations likely arises from surface gravity effects , as higher surface gravity objects have a lower t@xmath3 at a given spectral type .",
    "masses , radii and ages are derived for objects in our sample using the @xcite evolutionary models , while independent mass and radius determinations are made for eight t dwarfs with luminosity measurements .",
    "broad agreement between these values suggests that current brown dwarf evolutionary models are accurate at late ages , although this must be verified through improved luminosity determinations .    the comparative technique described here is a useful tool for determining the physical properties of the lowest - luminosity brown dwarfs , making efficient use of low resolution , and therefore more sensitive , spectroscopy . as such",
    ", it is a promising method for characterizing large samples arising from deep surveys , enabling a direct determination of the galactic substellar mf and formation history . while our method remains tied to the current generation of spectral models , susceptible to persistent opacity deficiencies , the increased use of fiducial calibrators will ultimately enable a wholly empirical approach , allowing critical tests of atmospheric and evolutionary theories in addition to the characterization of individual brown dwarfs in the vicinity of the sun .",

    "<S> we present a method for measuring the physical parameters of the coldest t - type brown dwarfs using low resolution near infrared spectra . by comparing h@xmath0o- and h@xmath0-sensitive spectral ratios between empirical data and theoretical atmosphere models , and calibrating these ratios to measurements for the well - characterized 25 gyr companion brown dwarf gliese  570d </S>",

    "<S> derived temperatures are consistent with prior estimates based on parallax and bolometric luminosity measurements , and examination of possible systematic effects indicate that the results are robust . </S>",
    "<S> two recently discovered late - type t dwarfs , 2mass  0939@xmath12448 and 2mass  1114@xmath12618 , both appear to be @xmath250  k cooler than the latest - type t dwarf , 2mass  0415 - 0935 , and are potentially the coldest and least luminous brown dwarfs currently known . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , in general , higher surface gravity t dwarfs have lower effective temperatures and luminosities for a given spectral type , explaining previously observed scatter in the t@xmath3/spectral type relation for these objects . </S>",
    "<S> masses , radii and ages are estimated for the t dwarfs in our sample using the evolutionary models of burrows et al . ; we also determine masses and radii independently for eight t dwarfs with measured luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> these two determinations are largely consistent , lending support to the validity of evolutionary models at late ages . </S>",
    "<S> our method is well suited to large samples of faint brown dwarfs , and can ultimately be used to directly measure the substellar mass function and formation history in the galaxy . </S>"
