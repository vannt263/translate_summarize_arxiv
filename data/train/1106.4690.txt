    "the distribution of prime numbers shares many properties with the distribution of numbers that are representable as a sum of two squares , an analogy that is occasionally employed to obtain model problems for questions about the primes .",
    "let us consider the distributions of the two sets in arithmetic progressions .",
    "starting with the average orders , we have on the one hand the prime number theorem , asserting that @xmath5 . for the set @xmath6 of sums of two squares on the other hand , landau @xcite proved an analogous asymptotic in 1908 , namely @xmath7 where @xmath8 .    turning towards more general arithmetic progressions ,",
    "let @xmath9 and @xmath10 be coprime integers , then the primes congruent to @xmath11 satisfy @xmath12 . building on landau s result and the analogy to primes , prachar @xcite proved in the 1950s that , when furthermore @xmath13 holds , sums of two squares show the following behaviour @xmath14 where @xmath15 the factor @xmath16 describes that the density of sums of two squares is twice as high in the progression @xmath17 as it is in @xmath18 . from pairs",
    "@xmath19 that are not coprime , one needs to remove those choices from consideration that lead to whole progressions entirely lying outside the set @xmath6 .",
    "examples are integers @xmath20 such that @xmath21 , which are never a sum of two squares , or , numbers of the form @xmath22 , which can only be a sum of two squares when @xmath23 .",
    "when excluding such classes @xmath11 , the constant @xmath24 only needs to be adapted by restricting the product over @xmath25 to primes dividing @xmath26 .",
    "thus , both sets , the primes and the sums of two squares , show some uniformity in the distribution in residue classes once one excludes residue classes that for obvious reason contain too few elements .",
    "it is natural to ask whether this uniformity carries further : is , for instance , the distribution uniform enough to determine asymptotically the density of solutions to linear equations within these sets ?",
    "more precisely , we are interested in an asymptotic for correlations of the form @xmath27 where the @xmath28 are affine linear forms and where the arithmetic function @xmath29 is either the characteristic function @xmath30 of sums of two squares , or it is chosen to be the characteristic function of primes .",
    "green and tao studied these correlations in the case of the primes in @xcite .",
    "they replaced for this purpose the sparse set of primes by a weighted version of asymptotic density @xmath31 which is given by the von mangoldt function .",
    "we shall _ not _ normalise the characteristic function @xmath30 in an analogous way , but instead consider the intrinsically weighted function that is given by the representation function of sums of two squares , @xmath32 .",
    "counting lattice points in a circle of radius @xmath33 immediately shows that the representation function has indeed an asymptotic density given by @xmath34 . as we will see , the nilpotent hardy - littlewood method which green and tao developed to handle linear correlations among the primes can also be employed in the case of the representation function @xmath35 .    instead of restricting attention to representations as sums of two squares , the slightly more general case of representation by a positive definite binary quadratic form @xmath36 will be considered .",
    "the corresponding representation function is then given by @xmath37 .      throughout the paper ,",

    "we let @xmath42 denote the @xmath43-adic valuation .",

    "a linear correlation is defined along a system @xmath47 of affine linear forms .",
    "such a system may be written as @xmath48 , for a linear map @xmath49 .",
    "we regard @xmath49 as fixed , while @xmath50 may , for instance , depend on @xmath4 .",
    "thus , all implicit constants in asymptotic notation , such as @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , are allowed to depend on the coefficients of the linear map @xmath54 , the dimensions @xmath55 and @xmath56 of the domain and the target space of @xmath57 , and on the discriminants of the forms @xmath58 .",
    "the nilpotent hardy - littlewood method comprises a scheme that allows to obtain for any given arithmetic function @xmath59 with sufficiently quasi - random behaviour an asymptotic for the expression @xmath60 where @xmath61 is convex and satisfies @xmath62 $ ] for each @xmath63 . we proceed to describe the basic set - up for the method .",
    "there are two main requirements on @xmath59 .",
    "one is that @xmath59 has small gowers - uniformity norms ( see section [ application_section ] ) and the other is that one can find a majorant @xmath64 such that    1 .",
    "( _ majorant property _ )",
    "the point - wise estimate @xmath65 is satisfied for an absolute constant @xmath66 independent of @xmath67 , 2 .",

    "@xmath59 has positive relative density in @xmath68 in the sense that + @xmath69 , 3 .",
    "( _ pseudorandomness _ ) @xmath68 is a pseudorandom measure .",
    "a _ pseudorandom measure _ resembles a true probability measure .",
    "apart from requiring its total mass to be approximately @xmath31 , that is , @xmath70 , there are two further defining conditions for a pseudorandom measure : the linear forms condition and the correlation condition .",
    "each of them places some independence requirements upon @xmath68 .",
    "the linear forms condition for instance requires @xmath71 to hold for certain systems of affine linear forms . once in possession of such a pseudorandom majorant ,",
    "a number of tools are available .",
    "we will describe them as we encounter them .",
    "regarding the first condition on @xmath59 , which was the smallness of certain gowers - uniformity norms , there is an explicit ( and quite strong ) necessary condition that has to be satisfied : @xmath59 must be equidistributed in residue classes to small moduli .",
    "the results quoted at the beginning of this introduction show that neither the characteristic function @xmath72 , nor its weighted version @xmath73 meet this requirement .",
    "in such a situation , it may be possible to decompose the function @xmath59 into a sum of functions that are more uniformly behaved and consider each of these functions separately .",
    "this decomposition is known as @xmath74-trick and will be carried out in section [ w - trick ] .    in section [ rep - majorant - section ]",
    "we construct a majorant for the representation function attached to a primitive form @xmath75 .",
    "this majorant will be slightly modified in accordance to the @xmath74-trick in section [ w - trick ] . in section [ linear - forms - and - correlation - conditions ] we check that our majorant is indeed pseudorandom .    in the course of the minor arc analysis , which starts in section [ non - corr - intro ] , we observe that polynomial subsequences of @xmath76-equidistributed linear nilsequences are still reasonably equidistributed",
    ". see proposition [ equid_subsequences ] below .",
    "this result will be deduced from the quantitative equidistribution theory green and tao worked out in @xcite . in connection with their factorisation theorem (",
    "* thm 1.19 ) , it could prove a useful tool for the minor arc analysis of a wider range of arithmetic problems .    due to the quite complex foundations of the green - tao methods it proved not feasible to provide a self - contained account of it here .",
    "this paper therefore strongly depends on @xcite .",
    "it furthermore relies on results about the divisor function from @xcite , which will be used in the construction of the pseudorandom majorants .      in @xcite",
    "a pseudorandom majorant for the normalised divisor function @xmath77 has been constructed . here",
    "we shall combine this majorant with a sieving majorant to obtain a pseudorandom majorant for the function @xmath78 which counts the number of representations of @xmath20 by a primitive positive definite binary quadratic form ; results for the non - primitive case are immediate corollaries .    with this majorant at hand , we obtain , employing the machinery from @xcite in combination with the inverse theorem for the gowers - uniformity norms @xcite , an asymptotic for the representation function @xmath79 evaluated along systems of linear equations :    [ main thm ] let @xmath80 be primitive positive definite binary quadratic forms .",

    "we emphasise , however , that , in contrast to the results from @xcite and @xcite , we unfortunately do not obtain explicit error terms in our asymptotic .",

    "the linear forms involved are not independent and thus an asymptotic would give very strong information on the regularity of distribution of the function involved .",

    "thus , we restrict our attention here to providing the necessary major and minor arc estimates specific to our problem and only summarise the procedures from @xcite we employ",
    ".    our approach to the minor arc estimate is modelled on a strategy one might choose in the classical setting : if @xmath863 is a rational that belongs to a suitably chosen notion of ` minor arc ' , then one obtains an upper bound for the expression @xmath864 by splitting into suitable summation ranges , fixing either @xmath336 or @xmath489 , and applying weyl s inequality .",
    "thus , in our case , we aim to employ the quadratic structure of the form @xmath75 by means of weyl s inequality in order to deduce the estimate @xmath865 for sufficiently equidistributed sequences @xmath866 .",
    "when working with a sequence @xmath867}$ ] directly , weyl s differencing trick may only be employed locally on so called generalised bohr neighbourhoods , where one can make the locally polynomial structure of a nilsequence explicit , cf .  the approach in @xcite .",
    "the crucial fact that makes weyl s differencing trick work for exponential sums is the fact that the exponential function is a group homomorphism .",
    "since @xmath111 is a lipschitz function , one expects it to have a good , i.e.  short , fourier approximation",
    ". in general , elements of a fourier basis in the non - abelian case arise from characters , i.e.  homomorphisms .",
    "thus there is a good chance that it is possible to employ weyl s inequality globally for elements of the fourier basis and hence for a short fourier approximation of a lipschitz function .    in our case ,",
    "the situation is considerably simplified by the availability of a complete quantitative equidistribution theory for polynomial orbits on nilmanifolds , which has been worked out by green and tao in @xcite .",
    "in particular , their generalisation of leon green s theorem ( ` quantitative leibman theorem ' ( * ? ? ? * thm.1.16 ) ) asserts that any polynomial sequences on a nilmanifold @xmath844 is @xmath76-equidistributed . ] _ if and only if _",
    "its projection on the horizontal torus is @xmath868-equidistributed , where the dependence is polynomial . the horizontal torus bears the advantage of being isomorphic to an ordinary torus @xmath869",
    "consequently , we need not consider the representation theory on nilpotent lie groups and their homogeneous spaces ; analysing the projected sequence on the horizontal torus by standard fourier analysis , or even the quantitative version of weyl s equidistribution theory , is sufficient .",
    "( the latter theory will actually reduce matters to looking at sequences @xmath870 arising from horizontal characters . )    our strategy , after reducing to the equidistributed case , is the following : let @xmath321 denote a polynomial of degree @xmath55 .",
    "then equidistribution of @xmath866 on @xmath844 implies that @xmath871 is equidistributed on the horizontal torus , which implies , as a consequence of weyl s equidistribution theory , that @xmath872 is equidistributed on the horizontal torus , which implies that @xmath873 is equidistributed on @xmath844 .",
    "the distribution of polynomial subsequences was not considered in @xcite , but will follow from results of that paper .",
    "these results will be proved in sections [ reduction_to_torus ] and [ poly_subs_section ] .    for the above strategy to work , a strong major arc analysis is required , because the @xmath74-trick introduces very large coefficients into the quadratic forms under consideration . for the major arc analysis , we rely on the observation that all of these large coefficients turn out",
    "to be entirely composed of small prime factors .",
    "we briefly describe in the next section how this information is used to choose major and minor arcs in the classical setting .",
    "the general case will be carried out in section [ poly_subs_section ] ( especially corollary [ modified_abelian_equid ] and proposition [ modified_general_equid ] which deal with polynomial subsequences that have large but smooth coefficients ) and section [ factorisation ] , which provides a factorisation of polynomial sequences into major and minor arcs .",
    "in this section we describe briefly and solely for motivational purposes how the major and minor arcs are chosen in the model case of correlation with linear phase functions @xmath874 instead of general nilsequences . here",
    "the task is to show that @xmath875 in section [ major - arcs ] , we saw that @xmath876 does not correlate with any @xmath10-periodic function of @xmath532-smooth period @xmath10 , provided @xmath877 is still quite large .",
    "it is therefore possible to choose the major arcs to consist of all rationals @xmath878 that are close to a rational with @xmath532-smooth denominator : in that case @xmath879 is close to a periodic function with @xmath532-smooth period .",
    "the minor arcs then comprise all @xmath863 that are not close to rationals with @xmath532-smooth denominators .",
