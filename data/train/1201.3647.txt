    "drifting subpulses are a modulation of the main pulsations seen in radio pulsars .",
    "several months after the pulsar discovery announcement by @xcite , this fast variation , or second periodicity , was already reported . by this time , the original suggestion that the pulsar s main periodicity originated from stars that pulsated competed with models of neutron stars that rotated .",
    "thus , the detection by @xcite of the `` class two effect '' , a much faster second periodicity ( @xmath110ms ) within the @xmath11s main period , was originally interpreted as a sign of a fast stellar pulsation , modulated by the slower stellar rotation . yet the amount of variation seen within this second periodicity was larger than was generally expected for neutron - star pulsations . in two papers in 1970 , don backer showed that the `` marching subpulses '' , as they were by now called , change period throughout the main pulse window , making stellar pulsations less likely but favoring magnetospheric interpretations .",
    "this pulsar magnetosphere is filled with dense plasma and the electric field is shielded almost everywhere . only in some geometrically small regions",
    "it is not ; there the electric field parallel to the magnetic field is capable of accelerating charged particles .",
    "such is the current radio - pulsar `` standard model '' , often called the force - free model , first introduced by @xcite , that we will refer to throughout this paper .",
    "it agrees very well with observational properties of pulsars : pulse peaks in both radio and gamma rays are very narrow , indicating small emitting regions , and hence , small regions of particle acceleration . in regions of closed magnetic field lines",
    "the plasma is trapped ; but plasma around open magnetic field lines flows away , forming the pulsar wind , and needing constant replenishment .",
    "this dense plasma consists mainly of electrons and positrons @xcite , and is created in small regions with strong , accelerating electric fields .",
    "there is compelling observational evidence of ongoing generation of electron - positron plasma : pulsars stop emitting in radio roughly where their parameters drop below the threshold for pair creation ; and observations of pulsar wind nebulae indicate they are fed by flows of dense plasma .",
    "the most plausible place for pair creation is the region of open magnetic field lines in the pulsar polar cap @xcite .",
    "this might be not the only place of pair production in the pulsar magnetosphere ( cf .",
    "* ) , but without pair production in the polar cap it is difficult to imagine how the `` standard model '' can work . thus , the existence of an accelerating region in the pulsar polar cap is an integral part of the `` standard model '' .",
    "plasma fills the whole closed magnetic field - line zone and co - rotates with the neutron star ( ns ) .",
    "dense plasma in the open magnetic field lines , however , exists only above the accelerating region : the region with screened electric field where magnetic field lines are frozen into the plasma is separated from the ns by an accelerating region with a strong electric field .",
    "now , the existence of this accelerating region in general causes rotation of plasma relative to the ns . as pulsar emission is most likely generated by the plasma in the region of open magnetic field , the power spectrum of that emission must have a feature due to this plasma rotation relative to the ns .",
    "we wish to emphasize that this is a general statement which does not depend on any particular model of pulsar radio emission .",
    "if , more specifically , `` stable '' emitting features exist in the plasma , such as current filaments or spark columns @xcite , then these will manifest as subpulses drifting across the pulse profile .",
    "there are alternative models for the drifting subpulses , not explicitly involving plasma rotation relative to the ns ; a concise review can be found in @xcite .",
    "some of these ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) rely on some sort of standing wave pattern ; the beating of the wave period with the rotational period of the pulsar provides a slow drift of emission features . in such models",
    "there are no distinct physical features actually moving relative to the star .",
    "however , fluctuation spectra for psrb0943@xmath310 have revealed symmetrical sidebands around its main phase modulation feature , indicative of an amplitude modulation every 20 drift bands @xcite ; the most natural explanation is the existence of actual long - lived emitting columns in the pulsar polar cap , columns that rotate relative to the ns .",
    "the model of @xcite suggests that a diochotron instability due to differential rotation of plasma gives rise to plasma columns in the open magnetic field line zone .",
    "these rotate relative to the ns , but with an angular velocity that is generally different from the angular velocity of the bulk plasma rotation .",
    "although the current - density profiles considered in @xcite are not directly related to existing pulsar models , in our opinion the proposed mechanism should be studied in more detail in the future .",
    "in this paper we consider the general idea that drifting subpulses are caused by plasma drift relative to the ns .",
    "such plasma rotation in the open field line region is an integral part of the standard model .",
    "our goal is not to establish a detailed model for drifting subpulses , but rather to explore testable predictions which can be made under such general assumptions about the origin of subpulse drift .",
    "we do not specify a particular mechanism leading to the formation of emitting plasma columns , but assume their existence causes regular drifting subpulses .",
    "even if ultimately it turns out that drifting subpulses are not caused explicitly by plasma rotation , this plasma rotation should still be visible as features in the power spectrum of pulsar emission .",
    "in section  [ sec : drift_theory ] we derive an expression for the angular velocity of plasma rotation relative to the ns .",
    "we point out a widespread misconception arising from the literal application of an order - of - magnitude expression for this angular velocity from @xcite . in that section",
    "we also argue that , using the exact expression , effects such as drift rate variations and drift direction reversals have a natural explanation within the standard model .    in section  [ sec :",
    "b ] we introduce pulsar psrb0826@xmath034  ( hereafter : b0826@xmath034 ) , a bright aligned rotator with subpulse - drift throughout the pulse window . in section  [",
    "sect : obs ] we outline the observational set up with which we measure such drift rate variations . in section  [ sect : modeling ] we present the relations found in section  [ sec : drift_theory ] in a form that can be directly applied to such drift rate observations , and we describe the results from this fitting .",
    "we then derive the maximum variations in potential drop over the polar cap of b0826@xmath034 , effectively using the subpulse drift in b0826@xmath034  as a voltmeter .",
    "the discussion and interpretations of these results take place in section  [ sect : discussion ] .",
    "we summarize and conclude in section  [ sect : conclusions ] .",
    "let us do a more careful derivation of the formula for the drift speed of plasma above the accelerating gap in the pulsar polar cap , than that presented in @xcite . in the reference frame corotating with the ns , faraday s law for electric and magnetic field",
    "as measured in the corotating frame has the same form as in the laboratory frame @xcite , namely @xmath4 the electric field in eq .",
    "( [ eq : faraday_law ] ) represents the non - corotational component of the electric field  the component which forces plasma to move in the rotating frame . in the corotating frame the temporal variations of the magnetic field in the polar cap",
    "can be caused only by fluctuations of currents in the magnetosphere .",
    "even if fluctuations of the electric current are of the order of the goldreich - julian current @xmath5 , the resulting variation of the magnetic field are @xmath6 ; here @xmath7 is the ns radius and @xmath8 is the light cylinder radius , @xmath9 is the angular velocity of ns rotation , @xmath10 is pulsar period in seconds .",
    "hence @xmath11 with high accuracy and circulation of the non - corotational electric field along a closed path is zero ( even for an inclined rotator ) .",
    "let us consider the circulation of the electric field along a fiducial path @xmath12  see fig .",
    "[ fig : drift_rate_derivation ]  in the polar cap of pulsar the top ( @xmath13 ) and bottom ( @xmath14 ) parts are infinitesimally small and are just below the ns surface ( @xmath14 ) and above the accelerating gap in the region of dense plasma with screened electric field ( @xmath13 ) ; the lateral sides ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) follow magnetic field lines .",
    "note that we consider a path which is fully in the open magnetic field line region , in contrast to the work of @xcite where one lateral path was along the field line along the polar cap boundary ( see their fig .",
    "4 ) . to clarify our derivation , fig .",
    "[ fig : drift_rate_derivation ] shows our unit vectors along positive directions for the perpendicular component of the electric field , @xmath17 , and the drift velocity , @xmath18 .",
    "the circulation of the electric field along this path is @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are components of the electric field , perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic field respectively , while @xmath22 are potential drops in the accelerating gap , along magnetic field lines . @xmath23 just below the ns surface which we assume to be a perfect conductor . taking the limit @xmath24",
    "we get for the non - corotational component of the electric field @xmath25 the drift velocity of the plasma relative to the ns is then @xmath26 the drift velocity of plasma relative to the ns thus depends on the _ variation _ of the electric potential in the acceleration zone .",
    "for aligned pulsars this result is well - known textbook material ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and for inclined rotators the correct general expression for the plasma drift velocity was explicitly mentioned in @xcite ; as we shall detail below , this result partially supersedes the ruderman & sutherland family of models , but it hasnt yet struck root . here we want to draw special attention to it , as it has profound consequences for the interpretation of pulsar drift phenomena .    the reasoning leading up to this conclusion , i.e.  the _ variation _ of the accelerating potential causes plasma drift , can be put differently and perhaps more insightful : the electric field is the gradient of the electrostatic potential , @xmath27 ; in the co - rotating frame the potential is the accelerating potential and the perpendicular electric field @xmath20 is the field which causes drift relative to the ns ; hence , @xmath28 .",
    "if , for example , the potential drop is the same along all polar - cap magnetic field lines , there is no relative rotation of plasma , however large the potential drop is . in that case",
    "though , there is a region very close to the polar cap boundary where the potential drop plummets to zero at the last closed magnetic field line .",
    "plasma in that region will have a very large drift velocity .",
    "the original derivation of the expression for @xmath29 in @xcite is similar to our derivation here , but instead of expressing @xmath29 in terms of the derivative of the accelerating potential @xmath30 , an order - of - magnitude estimate is used : their eq  ( 31 ) is equivalent to our eq .",
    "( [ eq : v_drift ] ) , but using the entire potential drop along a field line @xmath31 for @xmath32 , and half of the polar cap radius , @xmath33 , as an estimate for @xmath34 . yet",
    ", the potential drop in the pair - production zone is expected not to vary much from one field line to another , except at the boundaries of the active zone ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the active zone is also expected to be a noticeable part of the polar cap , at least in the space charge limited flow model @xcite .",
    "hence , the @xcite order - of - magnitude prediction for the drift rate is a large overestimate . and indeed",
    ", the drift rate speeds predicted by @xcite eq .  ( 31 ) are much larger than those observed  for example , the very slow but steady drift rate observed in psrb0809 + 74 @xcite is incompatible with this order - of - magnitude estimate .",
    "thus , in the most detailed drifting - subpulse models based on @xcite , a substantial reduction of the accelerating potential is necessary to reproduce these observed slow drift rates . in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", this is achieved by assuming highly non - dipolar polar - cap magnetic fields , and by fine - tuning the particle flux impact to produce the critical surface temperature .",
    "furthermore , literal application of ruderman & sutherland s ( @xcite ) expression for the plasma drift speed ( i.e.  in the form @xmath35 ) has difficulty explaining the drift - rate variations with time or longitude that are observed in several pulsars ( such as the bidirectional drift bands in psrj0815 + 09 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is incapable of producing the complete drift direction reversals seen in psrb0826@xmath034 .",
    "the explanation for such observed subpulse - drift reversals usually involves aliasing . in the case of b0826@xmath034",
    "this requires the circulation frequency to be fine - tuned to the rotation frequency , such that the aliased subpulses appear to move only very slowly ; and indeed @xcite were able to construct such a model .",
    "however , @xcite find that the observed reversals influence the intrinsic subpulse brightness , strongly suggesting that the reversal is not just apparent , but actually occurs in the corotating frame .",
    "the existence of such real reversals thus suggests a failing of the @xmath36 family of models .",
    "we want to point out that all these apparent discrepancies between model and observation are non - existent . using the derivation we present here , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : v_drift ] ) , no fine - tuning or additional assumptions , such as strong higher - order magnetic fields , are needed to explain the observed subpulse - drift properties .",
    "the drift rate depends on the variation of the potential drop from one field line to another .",
    "the potential drop can be very large , but if it does not change much across the polar cap the drift rate will be slow .",
    "depending on whether the potential drop increases or decreases toward the center of the polar cap the drift rate will be in one or another direction . if the potential - drop derivative at the line of sight varies with time , the observed drift speed changes , and can even reverse . in section  [",
    "sect : modeling ] , we use subpulse - drift data from b0826@xmath034  to show that the variation of the accelerating potential necessary to explain these phenomena is small indeed , and that the model is plausible .",
    "we reiterate that we are not solving these problems by introducing extra assumptions on how the potential drop varies .",
    "( [ eq : v_drift ] ) simply _ is _ the correct dependence for the drift velocity of the plasma , it is not a fine - tuning or modification of the previously widely used order - of - magnitude expression for @xmath29 . if drifting subpulses are indeed due to plasma motion relative to the ns , all their properties depend on the variation of the potential drop and not on the potential drop itself . in section  [",
    "sect : discussion ] we will also argue that all the properties of the accelerating potential necessary for explanation of various properties of drifting subpulses seem to be integral properties of the standard pulsar model .      in pulsars with subpulse drift , eq .",
    "( [ eq : v_drift ] ) can be used to set limits on the local parameters of the pulsar polar cap . there",
    ", a measurement of the plasma drift velocity provides the value of the radial derivative of accelerating potential . in practice however , the quantity that subpulse - drift observations produce is the angular drift velocity of subpulses within the pulsar profile , not the plasma drift velocity in the pulsar coordinate frame that is needed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : v_drift ] ) .",
    "below we derive expressions that connect observable parameters to the variation of the accelerating potential .",
    "the momentary angular velocity of plasma relative to a magnetic axis is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the distance between our sight - line path and the magnetic axis .",
    "when we derived this expression in section  [ sec : drift_theory_1 ] , we considered the path segment @xmath13 in the region above the accelerating gap where electric field is screened , and so @xmath39 in eq .",

    ", the plasma drift relative to the ns will be a rotation around this magnetic axis .",
    "the magnetic flux can be measured as the flux trough a circle of radius @xmath38 , and equation ( [ eq : delta_omega_dvdr ] ) takes the form @xmath46    it will be convenient to normalize the potential drop along a magnetic field line to the potential drop across magnetic field lines at the ns surface between the rotation axis and the boundary of the polar cap in an aligned pulsar with the same period : @xmath47 here @xmath48 is the polar cap radius , @xmath49 is the magnetic flux through the polar cap , @xmath50 magnetic field strength in units of @xmath51  g , and @xmath52 is the ns radius in @xmath53  cm . in doing this numerical estimate we assumed that the polar cap is small enough that the variation of the magnetic field over it is negligible .",
    "@xmath54 is a good estimate for the available potential drop  if there were vacuum in the open magnetic field line zone the potential drop along magnetic field lines in the polar cap would reach a value comparable to @xmath54 at the height @xmath55 from the ns surface and then vary very slow with the altitude , approaching its maximum value @xmath54 from below .",

    "for such a study our line of sight must cross two separate drift bands at different colatitudes .",

    "a mathematica notebook containing these equations as well as routines to derive potential drop curves from driftrate data , is publicly available .",
    "so , from figures [ fig : vmax ] and [ fig : v ] it follows that the accelerating potential varies both in space and time .",
    "the spatial variations occur between the two driftbands , over a range as large as 20% of the polar cap radius ; the temporal variations occur on timescales much larger that pulsar rotation period . still , both types of variations are very small  of order only several times @xmath101 .    if we next derive the nominal vacuum potential drop for b0826@xmath034  per eq .",

    "below we propose a qualitative model for drifting subpulses and discuss potential future work .",
    "the accelerating potential estimates we produce , only make the general assumption that subpulses are produced by emitting features that are stationary relative to the outflowing plasma in the polar cap region , and their drift is due to the rotation of this plasma , relative to the pulsar . here",
    "we wish to propose a more specific , but still qualitative and schematic , model for drifting subpulses that well fits the de - facto standard force - free model of pulsar magnetospheres , and that is consistent with the results presented in this paper .",
    "first , we address the question why drift rates can change on timescales much larger than the pulsar s rotational period . in the frame of the force - free pulsar model ,",
    "the potential drop in the pulsar polar cap depends on the current density flowing along a given magnetic field line and not only on the local physics of the polar cap ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "yet this current density depends on the _ global _ magnetospheric configuration ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "changes in the accelerating potential in the polar cap should be , therefore , manifestations of changes in the global magnetosphere configuration . at some stages of the pulsar spin - down evolution ,",
    "@xcite suggested , ulsar magnetosphere can change its configuration on timescales much larger than the pulsar period , and/or have meta - stable states . in the standard model , the pulsar magnetosphere , the polar cap cascade zone , and the current sheet zone carrying most of the return current ,",
    "are tightly coupled .",
    "as these regions all have different time scales , the resulting system might constitute a highly non - linear dynamical system with varied behavior on a wide range of characteristic timescales @xcite .",
    "hence , the pulsar magnetosphere as a whole determines the properties of pulsar emission ; such an idea in general was discussed before by @xcite for example .",
    "so , when the global configuration of the magnetosphere changes , the current density distribution and the accelerating potential in the polar cap change with it , and hence does the plasma drift velocity in the open field - line zone .",
    "nonlinear dynamical systems can evolve on very long time scales , and so the pulsar magnetosphere might too change on time scales much larger than that of its composing parts .",
    "the pulsar under study here , b0826@xmath034 is not unique in exhibiting changes on timescales many times larger than the rotation period : after some mode switches , pulsar b0943@xmath310 , for example , shows a gradual drift - speed change on a 4000-period time scale @xcite .",
    "conversely , if a magnetosphere switches between meta - stable configurations , this results in mode changing and/or nulling .",
    "because these configurations have different current density distributions , we claim that with any mode change , the subpulse drift rate must change too .",
    "several mode - changing pulsars are already known to exhibit such markedly different subpulse drift in different modes ( e.g. psrb0031@xmath007 , @xcite ; or psrb1944 + 17 , @xcite ) .      given the accelerating potential in b0826@xmath034 we next discuss how large the inferred variations are , compared to its absolute value .",
    "the maximum achievable voltage in the polar cap is of the order of the potential drop across it ; the vacuum potential drop @xmath54 in our terminology . at some point",
    "the onset of pair creation screens the electric field and limits the extent of the accelerating zone . especially in young pulsars",
    "the height of the acceleration zone is much smaller than the width of the polar cap , and the potential drop is much less than the corresponding @xmath54 .",
    "now , recent self - consistent simulations of pair cascades in the polar cap @xcite have shown that this pair - plasma generation is non - stationary : thus , that each period of particle acceleration is followed by a quiet phase , in which the accelerating electric field is screened and no pairs are produced .",
    "this holds for both the @xcite and space charge limited flow @xcite regimes . in these simulations ,",
    "the cascade behavior depends on the current density : that density defines the duration of the active and quiet phases ; it also determines the maximum potential drop in the active phase .",
    "thus , these simulations strongly suggest that traditional estimates for the potential drop ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are very inaccurate .",
    "the source under study in this paper , b0826@xmath034 , is a rather long - period pulsar , with @xmath108  s , located close to the pulsar death line .",
    "if we assume that the cessation of pair plasma production is responsible for a pulsar s demise , then the potential drop in b0826@xmath034  should be close its maximum possible value : the vacuum drop . in section  [ sect : modeling ] we found potential - drop variations with time of @xmath109 , i.e.very small compared to the value of the potential drop , even if the actual potential drop would be an order of magnitude smaller than the vacuum drop34 , for dipolar and strongly non - dipolar ( magnetic field - line curvature of @xmath53  cm ) fields respectively , are @xmath1@xmath54 and @xmath110 for the space charge limited flow ( using expressions from * ? ? ?",
    "for the @xcite model we get @xmath111 and @xmath112 . ] .",
    "the magnetospheric configuration changes that cause such one - in - a - thousand acceleration - drop fluctuations should be very small , and are unlikely to influence the stability of the magnetosphere , or be visible in profile or spindown - rate variations .",
    "overall , to us the inferred small magnetospheric fluctuations seem quite plausible .",
    "finally , let us now address the question of what could cause these stationary features in the outflowing electron - positron plasma , that manifest themselves as drifting subpulses .",
    "the current most standard explanation @xcite assumes that plasma generation in the pulsar polar cap occurs in `` spark columns '' that are isolated by vacuum , and that these columns drift relative to the ns .",
    "the plasma then flows only along certain magnetic field lines ; and thus the emitting regions are spatially localized . in our view , such a picture has serious difficulties .",
    "we will outline these below .",
    "first , because of the magnetic field line curvature , any spark column should quickly drift toward the magnetic pole , as pair - plasma generation with each cascade iteration occurs closer to the magnetic symmetry axis .",
    "@xcite have suggested that in a specific symmetric configuration with a central spark , a polar cap stably packed with sparks could exist .",
    "more detailed simulations are necessary to prove that this could indeed be the case even in such a symmetric configuration .",
    "recent self - consistent simulation of pair cascades @xcite have shown that the characteristic time scale between discharges can be much larger than previously assumed .",
    "this indicates that the electrodynamics of the cascade zone , even for short period pulsars , resembles more strongly a long tube with conducting walls , than a short cylinder with all characteristic dimensions of order the polar - cap width @xmath48 ( as assumed in @xcite models ) .",
    "this would imply that the coupling of the accelerating electric fields across the polar is more complex than assumed before , and calling into question the existence of distinct quasi - stable spark patterns such as those proposed in @xcite .",
    "second : we have thus far used eq .",
    "( [ eq : v_drift ] ) on a polar cap that is completely filled with plasma ; the equation is , however , equally applicable to plasma columns surrounded by vacuum .",
    "outside of the plasma column the electric field is unscreened , and the accelerating potential along the magnetic field lines there is much higher than inside the column , where the accelerating electric field is ( partially ) screened by the pair plasma .",
    "now the shape and variation of the potential drop _ inside _ the plasma column determine the plasma drift velocity .",
    "magnetospheric parameters like the magnetic field strength or the current density should not change much over the width of the column .",
    "the column is much smaller than the polar cap , and column properties are set by the local physics such as the local plasma density . the magnetic field line in the plasma column which has the maximum plasma density ( the column `` center '' )",
    "should then have the smallest potential drop .",
    "thus , @xmath31 reaches its minimum value here , and the plasma _ does not drift _ there .",
    "the potential drop rises from this minimum value toward all column edges . plasma on opposite sides of the column `` center '' , will drift in opposite directions ; a symmetric plasma column , for example , on average does not drift at all , which is striking .",
    "this invariably raises the question of spark - column stability , as such differential rotation leads to azimuthal smearing of the spark column . of course , our arguments rely on a rather qualitative picture for the plasma column , and only accurate multidimensional simulations of pair cascades can verify them , but they are nevertheless more rigorous than the original @xcite argumentation .    based on these arguments",
    "we speculate that , in time - average sense , in the active zone of the polar cap , pair productions happens uniformly , without vacuum regions along some magnetic field lines .",
    "the potential - drop variation across the active zone is therefore rather small and so the plasma drift is slow .",
    "the distinct emitting features in such plasma flow could be due to current filaments , somewhat similar to ones observed in auroras .",
    "if so , the generation of a quasi - stationary system of such filaments depends on the global magnetosphere structure , which could then also explain its longevity .",
    "formation of a stable filament pattern may require a specific magnetosphere configuration , thus happening in only some pulsars . for pulsars where stable filament structures can not form ( i.e.  where filaments form and disappear chaotically ) , there will be no clearly visible drifting subpulses . in those pulsars",
    "however , steady plasma rotation still occurs . and indeed , most of the pulsars studied by @xcite that do not show clear , stable drift bands , still have periodic features in their power spectra  in our interpretation manifestations of the underlying _",
    "plasma rotation_.      certain observations could verify or falsify our model .    in this paper we relied on the geometrical model of b0826@xmath034  proposed by @xcite .",
    "only with a more accurate geometrical model can we place more robust constraints on the plasma rotation in the polar cap on this pulsar .",
    "polarization measurements can constrain this emission geometry by measuring the polarization angle sweep .",
    "such observations would have to be undertaken with sufficient collecting area , as only single - pulse polarization measurements can identify and correct for the orthogonal mode changes in b0826@xmath034  @xcite .",
    "using their averaging technique , @xcite followed the strong drift tracks , and integrated all single pulses that have the same drift track phase .",
    "those average profiles suggest that drift tracks exist in between the two strongly emitting regions .",
    "these tracks sample co - latitudes between our two extremes @xmath74 .",
    "observations with higher sensitivity than those presented here could measure the pulse - to - pulse drift rate changes of those weak subpulses , and provide acceleration potential estimate over the intermediate range of colatitudes .    if observations at higher frequencies sample lower emission heights @xcite , where the polar cap radius @xmath48 is reduced , then the observer sight line may start to cross @xmath48 .",
    "from that , the extent of the polar cap and the values of @xmath74 could be derived . in recent observations at 3094mhz @xcite the pulse profile of b0826@xmath034  still spans 360@xmath113 however , so any evidence for a decreasing pulse width would to be sought at even higher frequencies .",
    "after the report of the existence of the weak emission mode in b0826@xmath034  by @xcite , no evidence for such a mode was found by @xcite , down to an upper limit reported to be more constraining than the original detection in @xcite .",
    "in addition to the confirmation of the weak mode at 685 and 3094mhz in @xcite , we have here detected b0826@xmath034  in weak mode in all datasets from table [ table : obs ] ; including in the data not originally used by @xcite , such as the dataset in the right panel of figure [ fig : onoff ] .    in the model",
    "we suggest , the weak mode is a magnetospheric state that is different from the strong mode , and should have a different plasma drift rate .",
    "thus , the detection of subpulse - drift in the weak mode would provide a stringent test of the general model we propose .",
    "in this paper we pointed out that plasma rotation in the open magnetic field - line zone depends not on the value but on the _ variation _ of the accelerating potential across the polar cap .",
    "if drifting subpulses are caused by this plasma drift , then by measuring the drift rate at two different colatitudes one can set limits on the accelerating potential variation between these colatitudes .",
    "we next applied this technique to observations of aligned rotator b0826@xmath034 , a favorably oriented but otherwise average regular pulsar .",
    "thus the limits on the potential drop variation we obtained are representative for @xmath114  sec pulsars .",
    "we found that the accelerating potential varies over the colatitude range @xmath115 by a factor of only several @xmath116 of the vacuum potential drop over the polar cap . in b0826@xmath034 ,",
    "drift rates change with time , suggesting that the accelerating potential along a given magnetic field line changes with time as well .",
    "the temporal variations of the potential drop are again a few times @xmath116 of the vacuum potential over the polar cap , of the same order as the potential difference across the colatitude range of the driftbands .",
    "the smallness of these variations points to a remarkable stability of the potential drop over these colatitudes , and provides useful constraints on ( future ) self - consistent models of plasma generation in pulsars .",
