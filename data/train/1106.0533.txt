    "superconductivity in hole - doped ( ba@xmath2k@xmath3)fe@xmath4as@xmath4 @xcite ( bak122 , in the following ) was found soon after the discovery of superconductivity with high critical temperatures in oxypnictide feas - based materials @xcite .",
    "several studies reported anisotropic properties of single crystals , representative of various parts of the phase diagram @xcite , however , no systematic evolution of the resistivity and its anisotropy was undertaken so far , due to a difficulty in preparation of single crystals with well controlled potassium content .",
    "high quality single crystals of k - doped materials can be grown from feas flux @xcite , however , the high melting temperature of the flux , leading to high potassium vapor pressure , limits this technique to growth of only the underdoped compositions .",
    "the compositions on the overdoped side can be grown from kas flux @xcite .",
    "initial success in growing single crystals through the use of sn flux , and finding their low anisotropy through measurements of the upper critical field @xcite , was stopped by finding of the macroscopic phase separation in sn - flux @xcite or polycrystalline @xcite samples and gross effect of small sn incorporation on the phase diagram @xcite .",
    "measurements of anisotropy are of great importance for understanding the normal state of iron pnictide superconductors .",
    "for example , careful characterization of the anisotropic resistivity in electron - doped ba(fe@xmath2co@xmath3)@xmath4as@xmath4 ( baco122 in the following ) found unusual anisotropy of transport both in the normal @xcite and in the superconducting @xcite states .",
    "the in - plane transport reveals close to linear @xmath13 at optimal doping , which evolves systematically towards @xmath14 behavior in the heavily overdoped compositions , suggestive of a quantum critical point at optimal doping @xcite .",
    "the inter - plane resistivity , @xmath15 , on the other hand , reveals an unusual maximum @xcite , correlating well with temperature - dependent nmr knight shift @xcite representative of a pseudogap .",
    "the characteristic temperature of the pseudogap decreases with co - doping and vanishes at @xmath16=0.31 recovering normal metallic properties , in particular suppressing temperature - dependent spin susceptibility @xcite and hall effect @xcite .",
    "broad crossover with notable slope change of temperature - dependent resistivity is also observed in in - plane transport in single crystals of bak122 at doping close to optimal @xcite , similar to pure stoichiometric kfe@xmath4as@xmath4 ( k122 ) @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that this unusual temperature dependence of resistivity stems from multi - band effects @xcite , with the contribution of conductivity channels with nearly temperature - independent and strongly temperature - dependent resistivities . on the other hand , multi - component analysis of in - plane resistivity @xmath17 in isoelectron ru - doped baru122",
    ", suggests that a crossover - type temperature dependence is characteristic of hole contribution , while electronic contribution is close to @xmath18-linear @xcite .",
    "in this article we perform detailed study of the temperature - dependent in - plane and inter - plane resistivity of bak122 over a broad doping range from parent compound to close to optimal doping level @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "we show that the unusual temperature dependence of the in - plane resistivity correlates with the pseudo - gap resistivity maximum in the inter - plane resistivity .",
    "this is dramatically different from the lack of any pseudo - gap related features in the temperature - dependent in - plane resistivity of electron - doped materials .",
    "another difference between electron- and hole- doped materials is an increase of the resistivity crossover temperature @xmath20 in bak122 with doping .",
    "single crystals of bak122 were grown using high temperature feas flux technique @xcite . because of the volatility of k during growth , single crystals have a distribution of potassium content , with inner parts of the crystals frequently having @xmath21 differing by 1 to 3 k from the surface parts . for our study",
    "we selected samples using the sharpness of the superconducting transition as a measure of constant dopant concentration .",
    "samples for the study were cut from the inner parts of single crystals . after cutting , we performed precision magnetic susceptibility measurements so that we could inspect the samples for possible inclusions with lower @xmath21 .",
    "in addition samples were extensively characterized by magneto - optic techniques to look for possible inhomogeneity , as described in detail in ref .  .",
    "only samples with sharp transitions were selected .",
    "the chemical composition was measured on selected crystals using wavelength dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( wds ) in jeol jxa-8200 electron microprobe .",
    "the composition was measured for 12 points per single crystal and averaged .",
    "samples for in - plane resistivity measurements had typical dimensions of ( 1- 2)@xmath220.5@xmath22(0.02 - 0.1 ) mm@xmath23 .",
    "all sample dimensions were measured with an accuracy of about 10% .",
    "contacts for four - probe resistivity measurements were made by soldering 50 @xmath24 m silver wires with ultrapure sn solder , as described in ref .  .",
    "this technique produced contact resistance typically in the 10 @xmath25 range .",
    "inter - plane resistivity was measured using a two - probe technique , relying on the negligibly small contact resistance .",
    "samples typically had dimensions 0.5@xmath220.5@xmath220.1 mm@xmath23 ( @xmath26 ) , their top and bottom ab - plane surfaces were covered with sn solder forming a capacitor - like structure .",
    "four - probe scheme was used down to the sample to measure series connected sample , @xmath27 , and contact , @xmath28 resistance .",
    "taking into account that @xmath29 , contact resistance represents a minor correction of the order of 1 to 5% .",
    "this can be directly seen for our samples for temperatures below the superconducting @xmath21 , where @xmath300 and the measured resistance represents @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the details of the measurement procedure can be found in refs .  .",
    "the drawback of the measurement on samples with @xmath31 is that any inhomogeneity in the contact resistivity or internal sample connectivity admixes the in - plane component due to redistribution of the current . to minimize this effect",

    "several features should be noticed .",
    "first , the curves for samples with @xmath38 ( @xmath39 26k ) show a small but clear anomaly on passing through the temperature of coupled structural / magnetic transition @xmath7 , with resistivity accelerating its decrease on cooling .",

    "this insensitivity to doping is difficult to explain in any multi - band model , and by comparison with inter - plane resistivity , we suggest that this resistivity feature is a reflection of a pseudogap crossover at @xmath20 in the inter - plane transport , whose position is shown by arrows in fig .",
    "[ f2_inplane ] .",

    "note , that beyond this feature , samples with @xmath16=0.28 and @xmath16=0.35 , close to optimal doping @xmath45=0.4 , show nearly linear temperature - dependent resistivity . this can be seen as a flattening of the resistivity derivative below @xmath46100  k above the superconducting transition .",

    "contrary to baco122 , magnetic ordering and the structural transition happen simultaneously in bak122 at a temperature @xmath48=@xmath49 @xcite .",
    "magnetic ordering should reconstruct the fermi surface , opening a nesting or superzone gaps on electron and hole pockets . in hole - doped materials",
    "this gap opening , instead of leading to a resistivity increase , leads to an accelerated resistivity decrease ( increase of resistivity derivative ) , suggesting that the main effect comes from a change in the inelastic scattering due to taming down the contribution of pre - transition fluctuations of the order parameter .",
    "the parts of the fermi surface which are not affected by the sdw gap @xcite , enjoy a notably reduced inelastic scattering in the magnetically ordered phase @xcite .",
    "in the parent compound , in which disorder , introduced by dopants , is absent and thus elastic scattering is small , this decrease of scattering overcomes the loss of the carrier density so that the total conductivity increases below @xmath7 . since the inter - plane transport is dominated by the most warped parts of the fermi surface @xcite , least affected by the sdw super - zone gap , the inter - plane resistivity should be affected much less by the sdw gap opening than @xmath50 .",
    "this is indeed seen , in bak122 , very similar to baco122",
    ".      in baco122 the decrease of the inter - plane resistivity below @xmath20 shows a clear correlation with the nmr knight shift , which was the reason for our suggestion of its relation to a pseudogap . at temperatures below @xmath20",
    "both the knight shift and the inter - plane resistivity in baco122 follow the expectations of a metal with temperature - independent density of states , but become temperature - dependent at @xmath51 . very recently",
    "similar measurements have been undertaken in optimally doped bak122 @xcite , and in stoichiometric kfe@xmath4as@xmath4 @xcite . at optimal",
    "doping the nmr knight shift is increasing with temperature while the spin - relaxation rate , 1/@xmath52 , decreases and becomes constant above @xmath46200  k. in overdoped kfe@xmath4as@xmath4 the knight shift was found to be nearly temperature independent , however , the temperature dependence of the korringa ratio indicated strong electron correlations . we need to notice though , that the decrease of the inter - plane resistivity , despite being very small , would be very difficult to explain by only a change of the scattering mechanism",
    ". it would require activation of carriers by excitations over the partial gap on the fermi surface ( pseudogap ) .",
    "measurements of the inter - plane resistivity in bak122 show that the magnetic / structural transition does not lead to resistivity increase , i.e. the loss of the carrier density at the transition is insignificant . on transition suppression with doping , temperature - dependent inter - plane resistivity becomes nearly linear above the superconducting transition , suggesting the existence of a quantum critical point .",
    "in addition to a feature in the temperature - dependent resistivity at @xmath7 , a broad maximum is found at a temperature @xmath53200  k , which by comparison with the electron - doped baco122 @xcite , we assign to the formation of pseudogap .    despite the effect of doping in multi - band metallic system",
    "may be quite complicated , comparison of the hole - doped bak122 with the electron - doped baco122 shows significant difference .",
    "a pseudogap resistive crossover at @xmath20 in the inter - plane resistivity vanishes with doping in baco122 but remains intact in bak122 .",
    "the crossover affects temperature - dependent in - plane resistivity in bak122 , however , it does not in baco122 .    on co - doping the in - plane resistivity at room temperature decreases by approximately a factor of 3 from @xmath16=0 to @xmath54=0.31 , while it does not show much variation on hole doping .",
    "this result may suggest that inelastic scattering is strongly suppressed in the case of co - doping , while it remains strong for hole - doped compositions .",
    "since a similar trend is seen for magnetic fluctuations , it is natural to expect that magnetic scattering contributes significantly to normal state inelastic scattering . supporting this conclusion",
    ", baco122 doped beyond the superconducting dome shows simple metallic behavior in resistivity ( both in- and inter - plane ) and pauli susceptibility @xcite , and temperature - independent hall constant @xcite , with all pseudogap features suppressed by @xmath54=0.31 . on the other hand , anomalous temperature - dependent resistivity with the resistivity crossover , suggesting the existence of the pseudogap ,",
    "is preserved in kfe@xmath4as@xmath4 .",
    "finally we would like to point to a certain similarity in the critical behavior of the inter - plane resistivity in bak122 and in cecoin@xmath55 . in cecoin@xmath55 , a true critical behavior at a field - tuned qcp @xcite with @xmath18-linear resistivity and violation of the wiedemann - franz law",
    "is observed for transport along the tetragonal @xmath56-axis @xcite , while transport along the plane obeys the wiedemann - franz law @xcite .",
    "this is similar to the difference in the temperature dependence of @xmath13 and @xmath12 in bak122 , with the latter being more linear at optimal doping .",

    "<S> a smeared feature at about the same temperature is seen in @xmath0 . for @xmath11 , </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of resistivity shows systematic evolution and is close to linear at optimal doping . </S>",
    "<S> this feature , being most pronounced for @xmath12 , suggests the existence of a quantum critical point close to optimal doping . </S>"
