    "in model theory , one works with an abstract notion of a structure , or a model .",
    "such a structure can be a set @xmath0 ( or a collection of sets ) , together with a distinguished collection of subsets of @xmath0 and its powers , the definable subsets . an example could be an algebraically closed field , with the definable sets being the field operations , solutions to equations derived from them ( polynomial equations ) .    there is a natural notion of maps of such structures , and so one may form the group @xmath1 of automorphisms ( invertible such self - maps ) of @xmath2 .",
    "this group and certain subgroups of it are an important tool in the study of definable sets and other model - theoretic objects . in general , the elements of this group have nothing to do with the elements of the structure @xmath2 itself . however ,",
    "under special circumstances , certain such automorphism groups are _ themselves definable _ : there is a canonical correspondence between the elements of the group and a definable subset in @xmath2 , and the ( graph of the ) group operation is also definable .",
    "this condition is known as internality .",
    "internality also provides ( under suitable assumptions ) a definable galois theory , that provides a correspondence between certain intermediate structures and definable subgroups .",
    "internality was first discovered in  @xcite , where it was used to study strongly minimal sets .",
    "it can be used in an abstract setting to study the relation between definable sets that are `` close '' to each other .",
    "however , it was also discovered in  @xcite that , when applied to a particular theory ( differentially closed fields ) , the definable galois group and the associated galois theory specialise to a classical construction , the galois group ( and galois theory ) of linear differential equations .",
    "it has since been applied to provide and study galois theory in various situations ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "a more detailed review of internality , along with some references appears in section  [ mod ] .",
    "whereas the original definition of internality appeared under rather specific model theoretic assumptions ( strongly minimal structures ) , it was subsequently generalised and simplified . in",
    "@xcite the construction appeared without any restrictions on the theories in question .",
    "it is shown in  @xcite , that a certain categorical construction , the algebraic group associated with a tannakian category , can also be viewed as an instance of this formalism .",
    "since the theory of internality no longer depends on `` stability theoretic '' assumption , it was natural to ask whether it is possible to go in the other direction , and recover the theory of internality ( or some variant ) from a categorical statement .",
    "the present paper is an attempt to answer this question . in the spirit of  @xcite , we replace a theory @xmath3 by its category of definable sets , and interpretations and models by suitable functors .",
    "we do not use the precise characterisation provided by  @xcite , since our result holds in greater generality , but the motivation comes from there . on the other hand , though the category of definable sets is not a topos , when the theory eliminates imaginaries it is rather close being that , and we use some ideas from topos theory , and more generally from category theory , in the style of  @xcite , that remain relevant in this case .",
    "the main results of this paper appear in sections  [ int ] and  [ progroup ] . in section  [ int ]",
    ", we make some observations on the category of definable sets of a theory ( some of these appear in  @xcite ) , and formulate categorical versions of stably embedded definable sets , and internality .",
    "we then prove a weak version of the existence of definable galois groups in the categorical context ( corollary  [ int : cor ] ) . in section  [ progroup ]",
    "we introduce additional assumptions on the data , that allow us to prove the full analogy to the model theoretic case . in section  [ examples ]",
    "we provide a sketch of two possible applications of these theorems .",
    "the main point of this paper is to explicate some analogies between model theoretic notions and constructions with categorical counterparts .",
    "it is therefore my hope that this paper is readable by anyone with minimal knowledge in these areas . to this end ,",
    "the paper includes two sections which are almost completely expository .",
    "section  [ cat ] reviews some basic notions from category theory , and discusses the categorical assumptions we would like to make .",
    "the only new result there is proposition  [ cat : aut ] ( which is a direct application of ends , and is possibly known ) and its corollary .",
    "section  [ mod ] contains a brief , and rather informal review of basic model theory , as well as internality and the associated galois group .",
    "hopefully , there are no new results there .",
    "we review some notions from category theory that will be used in the description of internality .",
    "the classical reference for these is  @xcite , though  @xcite is also sufficient .",
    "all categories in this paper are ( essentially ) small .    a contra - variant functor from a category @xmath4 to the category of sets will be called a _ presheaf _ ( on @xmath4 ) .",
    "the functor that assigns to an object @xmath5 the presheaf @xmath6 it represents is called the _ yoneda embedding _ , and the yoneda lemma states that this embedding is fully faithful ( induces a bijection on sets of morphisms ) . hence we also denote by @xmath5 the presheaf it represents , and view @xmath4 as a subcategory of its presheaf category whenever this is convenient . more generally , the yoneda lemma states that @xmath7 for any presheaf @xmath8 .",
    "all categories we consider , with the exception of index categories , will have all finite ( inverse ) limits . if @xmath4 is such a category , we denote by @xmath9 the terminal object ( empty product ) of @xmath4 , and by @xmath10 ( global sections ) the functor @xmath11 .",
    "our categories will not , usually , be closed under infinite limits or colimits . however , certain such limits appear naturally in what follows .",
    "we recall that a _ filtering category _ is a category @xmath12 in which any two objects map into a common object , and for any two maps @xmath13 there is some map @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "a _ filtering system _ in a category @xmath4 is a functor from a filtering category to @xmath4 .",
    "the category @xmath16 of _ ind - objects _ of @xmath4 is a category that contains @xmath4 as a full sub - category , admits the colimits of all filtering systems , and satisfies @xmath17 where @xmath5 and @xmath18 are objects of @xmath4 , and @xmath19 is the colimit of the system in @xmath16 ( note that if @xmath4 itself happens to admit the colimit @xmath20 of this system , this object will not be isomorphic to @xmath19 in @xmath16 ) .",
    "a construction of this category appears in  @xcite .",
    "the category @xmath21 of pro - objects is the dual notion : it is the opposite of the category of ind - objects of the opposite of @xmath4 .",
    "thus it consists of inverse limits @xmath22 of co - filtering systems in @xmath4 , with @xmath4 embedded as a full sub - category , and satisfying @xmath23 with similar conventions to the above .    because of the above properties",
    ", the objects of @xmath4 will be called _ compact _ when considered as objects of @xmath16 or @xmath21 . a functor ( or a presheaf )",
    "will be called pro - representable ( ind - representable ) if it is represented by a pro-  ( ind- )  object . in other words , it is a filtered colimit of representable functors ( presheaves ) .    by a _",
    "pro - group _ ( resp .",
    ", a pro - monoid , etc . ) in @xmath4 we mean a pro - object of @xmath4 that can be represented by an inverse filtering system of group ( resp .",
    "monoid ) objects of @xmath4 .",
    "such a pro - group is a group object in @xmath21 , but the converse is not true , in general : there may be group objects in @xmath21 which are not of this form .",
    "let @xmath4 be a category with finite inverse limits .",
    "given two objects @xmath5 and @xmath24 of @xmath4 , we denote by @xmath25 the presheaf @xmath26 .",
    "there is , therefore , a natural evaluation map @xmath27 , where @xmath5 and @xmath24 are identified with the presheaf they represent . applying the definition with @xmath28 ( and using yoneda s lemma )",
    ", we see that @xmath29 .    the category @xmath4 is called ( cartesian ) _ closed _ ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* iv.6 ) ) if all such @xmath30 presheaves are representable ( in which case the representing object is denoted by the same symbol , and is called the _ internal @xmath31 _ ) . in other words ,",
    "the functor @xmath32 has a right adjoint @xmath33 . by the yoneda lemma ,",
    "the evaluation map is also in @xmath4 in this case .    [",
    "cat : indclosed ] we will say that a category @xmath4 with finite inverse limits is _ ind - closed _ if @xmath25 is ind - representable for all objects @xmath5 and @xmath24 .",
    "note that @xmath16 again has all finite inverse limits , but the condition does not imply that @xmath16 is closed .",
    "instead , we know that @xmath25 exists ( and is constructed in the obvious way ) whenever @xmath5 is compact .",
    "again , the evaluation map is in @xmath16",
    ".    it may sometimes be difficult to determine whether a category is closed .",
    "however , for ind - closed , we have the following formal criterion .",
    "assume that @xmath4 has all finite limits and colimits .",
    "then it is ind - closed if and only if , for any object @xmath5 of @xmath4 , the functor @xmath32 commutes with finite colimits .",
    "the `` grothendieck construction '' presents every presheaf as a colimit of representable presheaves ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* vii ) ) .",
    "the system produced by the construction is filtering if the presheaf is left - exact ( takes finite colimits to the corresponding inverse limits ) .",
    "hence in a category that has finite colimits , the ind - representable presheaves are precisely the left - exact ones ( it is clear that any ind - representable presheaf is left - exact ) .",
    "since any representable presheaf is left - exact , @xmath25 is left - exact if @xmath34 preserves finite colimits .",
    "conversely , if @xmath4 is ind - closed , then @xmath34 commutes with colimits in @xmath16 , since it has a right adjoint there .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath4 in @xmath16 preserves finite colimits , so the result follows .    in our case , the requirement that finite colimits exist is too strong .",
    "it will be replaced by a more direct condition , elimination of imaginaries , ensuring that the system produced by the grothendieck construction is filtering ( see proposition  [ int : ei ] ) .",
    "if @xmath35 is any functor , it extends by composition to a functor @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath4 is ind - closed , and @xmath8 preserves finite inverse limits , we may apply @xmath8 to the evaluation map , to obtain a map @xmath37 .",
    "this induces a map @xmath38 , and we say that such a functor @xmath8 is _ closed _ if this map is an isomorphism .",
    "we recall that a map ( natural transformation ) @xmath39 from a functor @xmath35 to another functor @xmath40 consists of a collection morphisms @xmath41 , one for each object @xmath5 of @xmath4 , commuting with all maps that come from @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath4 and @xmath42 be two categories with finite inverse limits , and let @xmath35 be a left exact functor . for an object @xmath43 of @xmath42 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath44 the set of natural transformations from @xmath45 to @xmath8 ( where @xmath46 ) .",
    "each such natural transformation induces a transformation of @xmath45 to itself , and therefore @xmath47 is a presheaf of monoids on @xmath42 .",
    "we denote by @xmath48 the subset of @xmath44 consisting of transformations where the induced endomorphism above is invertible .",

    "these are again presheaves on @xmath42 .",
    "the main observation in this section is that if @xmath42 is closed , these presheaves are represented by a pro - monoid and a pro - group , respectively , of @xmath42 .",
    "[ cat : aut ] let @xmath49 and @xmath35 be functors .",

    "the end of a functor is in a natural way an inverse limit of diagrams as above .",
    "hence it exists if the category @xmath42 admits all inverse limits .",
    "the proof of proposition  [ cat : aut ] is a repetition of the above example internally :    assume first that @xmath84 is the empty category . by assumption , we have a functor @xmath70 , @xmath85 . since the category @xmath86 admits all filtered inverse limits , and @xmath42 ( and therefore @xmath86 ) admits all finite inverse limits , @xmath86 admits all inverse limits ( ( * ? ? ? * ix.1 ) ) .",

    "hence we may assume that @xmath5 is a subobject @xmath336 containing the identity @xmath337 , and @xmath316 is a group acting on @xmath5 . the identity map @xmath293 and the action @xmath338 of @xmath316 on @xmath5 induce a map @xmath339 .",
    "the pullback diagram defining @xmath316 implies that we have a pullback diagram @xmath334^{\\check{\\mu}}\\ar[d]_{j } & { { \\underline{hom}}}({{\\mathbf{x}}},{{\\mathbf{x}}})\\ar[d]^-{{{\\underline{\\circ k } } } } \\\\        { { \\mathbf{x}}}\\ar[r]_-{\\check{\\circ } } & { { \\underline{hom}}}({{\\mathbf{x } } } , { { \\underline{bi}}}({{\\mathscr{f}}}({{\\mathbf{c } } } ) ) )      } \\ ] ]    since @xmath340 is a monomorphism , the vertical map @xmath341 , induced by composition with @xmath340 , is by assumption proper .",
    "therefore @xmath316 , being the pullback over a compact object of a proper map , is itself compact .",
    "as explained above , corollary  [ int : cor ] and  [ thm : progroup ] are categorical analogues of the classical model theoretic theorem  [ mod : main ] .",
    "i now briefly mention two additional examples where the more general results may be applied .      instead of considering automorphisms of the full model @xmath342 , as in theorem  [ mod : main ] ,",
    "one may be interested in automorphisms of a definable set @xmath167 in @xmath3 that preserve only part of the structure on @xmath167 .",
    "this question was studied in  @xcite , where one is ultimately interested in automorphisms of a linear difference equation that preserve only the quantifier free formulas .",
    "the categorical version may be applied in this case by taking @xmath4 to be the sub - category consisting of the definable sets one wishes to preserve .",
    "the condition that this category eliminates imaginaries corresponds to the requirement that the internality datum that witnesses the fact that @xmath343 , should be preserved .      as mentioned above",
    ", the model theoretic theorem can be applied to prove a version the tannakian reconstruction theorem . below",
    "i outline the `` composition '' of the model theoretic argument with the categorical formulation of internality described above .",
    "this is not a complete example , but a `` work plan '' , since some of the assumptions may be difficult to verify .",
    "the idea is only to show how the language used here is translated in this case .",
    "let @xmath344 be a field of characteristic @xmath142 .",
    "recall ( @xcite ) that if @xmath345 is a ( symmetric , rigid , @xmath344-linear ) tensor category , one may construct the category @xmath346 of @xmath345-schemes as the opposite category of the category of ( commutative , unital ) algebras in @xmath347 ( such an algebra consists of an ind - object @xmath348 of @xmath345 , together with morphisms @xmath349 and @xmath350 , satisfying obvious axioms ) .",
    "this category admits finite inverse limits , since a pullback corresponds to a tensor product of algebras ( over a base ) , as well as finite co - products .",
    "furthermore , there is a faithful functor @xmath351 from @xmath345 to @xmath346 , sending @xmath5 to the symmetric algebra on the dual @xmath352 .",
    "let @xmath4 be the full sub - category of @xmath346 containing all object of the form @xmath353 , with @xmath5 , @xmath24 and @xmath289 objects of @xmath345 , as well as their finite co - products ( these are the `` finitely presented '' @xmath345-schemes ) .",
    "it again admits all finite inverse limits and co - products .",
    "it is possible to show , like in usual algebraic geometry , that @xmath25 is a strict ind - object for all objects @xmath5 and @xmath24 of @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , we take @xmath354 to be the category of finite - dimensional vector spaces over @xmath344 , so that @xmath84 is the category of finitely presented affine schemes over @xmath344 .",
    "an exact tensor functor between tensor categories induces a left - exact functor between the corresponding categories of schemes , which restricts to a functor between the finitely presented sub - categories .",
    "furthermore , the construction of the @xmath30 ind - schemes shows that the resulting functor is a stable embedding .",
    "in particular , the ( essentially unique ) tensor functor from @xmath354 to @xmath345 induces a functor @xmath49 .",
    "if @xmath345 is neutral tannakian , i.e. , we have an exact tensor functor @xmath355 to @xmath354 , this functor again induces a stable embedding @xmath250 , with @xmath52 isomorphic to the identity .",
    "we thus get an internal cover , in the sense of definition  [ int : def ] .",
    "if @xmath43 is any ( affine ) scheme over @xmath344 , setting @xmath356 to be base change by @xmath43 ( i.e. , @xmath357 as a functor from @xmath344-schemes to @xmath43-schemes ) , one gets from corollary  [ int : cor ] that any automorphism of the functor @xmath358 ( as a functor from @xmath4 to sets ) comes from a unique compatible collection of automorphisms of the @xmath43-schemes @xmath359 ; and furthermore , all such automorphisms correspond to the @xmath43-points of ( with the help of theorem  [ thm : progroup ] , whose assumptions should be verified ) a pro - group - scheme over @xmath344 , acting on all @xmath300 . in fact",
    ", this group comes from a pro - group in @xmath4 ( which is called the fundamental group of @xmath4 in  @xcite ) .",
    "note that if @xmath5 is the @xmath345-scheme associated to an object @xmath360 of @xmath345 , then @xmath300 is @xmath361 with its @xmath344-scheme structure .",
    "hence , if @xmath362 is an affine scheme over @xmath344 , then @xmath363 is identified ( at least as a set ) with @xmath364 .",
    "furthermore , the linear space and tensor structures are described by suitable maps between schemes , all of which come from @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , an automorphism of the functor @xmath358 as a functor to sets is the same as a tensor automorphism of the functor @xmath365 ."
