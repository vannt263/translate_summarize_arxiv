    "this paper presents the second data release from the radial velocity experiment ( rave ) , an ambitious spectroscopic survey of the southern sky which has already observed over 200,000 stars away from the plane of the milky way ( @xmath4 ) and with apparent magnitudes @xmath5 .",
    "the paper follows the first data release , described in @xcite , hereafter paper  i. it doubles the number of published radial velocities . for the first time it also uses spectroscopic analysis to provide information on values of stellar parameters : temperature , gravity , and metallicity . note that the latter in general differs from iron abundance , because metallicity is the proportion of matter made up of all chemical elements other than hydrogen and helium in the stellar atmosphere .",
    "stellar parameters are given for the majority of the newly published stars .",
    "this information is supplemented by additional data from the literature : stellar position , proper motion , and photometric measurements from denis , 2mass and tycho surveys .",
    "scientific uses of such a data set were described in @xcite .",
    "they include the identification and study of the current structure of the galaxy and of remnants of its formation , recent accretion events , as well as discovery of individual peculiar objects and spectroscopic binary stars .",
    "kinematic information derived from the rave dataset has been used @xcite to constrain the galactic escape speed at the solar radius to @xmath6 ( 90 percent confidence ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath7 is significantly greater than @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the local circular velocity ) is a model - independent confirmation that there must be a significant amount of mass exterior to the solar circle , i.e.  it convincingly demonstrates the presence of a dark halo in the galaxy . a model - dependent estimate yields the virial mass of the galaxy of @xmath10  m@xmath11 and the virial radius of @xmath12  kpc ( 90 per cent confidence ) .",
    "@xcite discussed kinematics towards the galactic poles and identified discontinuities that separate thin disk , thick disk and a hotter component .",
    "@xcite searched for in - falling stellar streams on to the local milky way disc and found that it is devoid of any vertically coherent streams containing hundreds of stars .",
    "the passage of the disrupting sagittarius dwarf galaxy leading tidal stream through the solar neighborhood is therefore ruled out .",
    "additional ongoing studies have been listed in paper  i.    the structure of this paper is as follows : section 2 is a description of the observations , which is followed by a section on data reduction and processing .",
    "data quality is discussed in section 4 , with a particular emphasis on a comparison of the derived values of stellar parameters with results from an analysis of external data sets .",
    "section 5 is a presentation of the data product , followed by concluding remarks on the results in the context of current large spectroscopic surveys .",
    "rave is a magnitude limited spectroscopic survey . for this reason it avoids any kinematic bias in the target selection .",
    "the wavelength range of 8410 to 8795    overlaps with the photometric cousins @xmath13 band . however the denis and 2mass catalogs were not yet available at the time of planning of the observations we present here .",
    "so this data release uses the same input catalog as paper  i : the bright stars were selected using @xmath13 magnitudes estimated from the tycho-2 @xmath14 and @xmath15 magnitudes @xcite , and the faint ones were chosen by their @xmath13 magnitudes in the supercosmos sky survey @xcite , hereafter sss . transformations to derive the @xmath13 magnitude and its relation to the denis @xmath13 magnitude values are discussed in paper  i. there we also comment on the fact that supercosmos photographic @xmath13 magnitudes show an offset with respect to denis @xmath13 magnitudes ( fig .",
    "[ f01 ] ) .",
    "so , although the initial magnitude limit of the survey was planned to be 12.0 , the actual limit is up to one magnitude fainter .",
    "the survey spans a limited range in apparent magnitude , still it probes both the nearby and more distant galaxy .",
    "typical distances for k0 dwarfs are between 50 and 250  pc , while the k0 giants are located at distances of 0.7 to 3  kpc .",
    "-band magnitudes of rave spectra in the 2nd data release .",
    "the smooth line denotes magnitudes derived from tycho-2 and sss survey photometry which were used as an input catalog for rave .",
    "the solid line histogram depicts denis @xmath13 magnitudes for the 77%  of stars which are also in the 2nd release of the denis catalog .",
    "short and long dashed lines are histograms of denis @xmath13 magnitudes for stars from the tycho-2 and sss surveys , respectively .",
    "test fields close to the galactic plane ( @xmath16 ) are not plotted .",
    ", width=328 ]    the instrumental setup is similar to the one used in paper  i. two field plates with robotically positioned fibers are used in turn in the focus of the uk schmidt telescope at the anglo - australian observatory .",
    "a field plate covers a @xmath17 field of view and feeds light to up to 150 fibers each with an angular diameter of 6.7 \" on the sky .",
    "one should be careful to avoid chance superpositions with target stars when using such wide fibers . as a precaution",
    "we avoid regions close to the galactic plane ( @xmath16 ) or dense stellar clusters .",
    "also , all candidate stars are visually checked for possible contamination prior to observing using the 1-arcmin sss thumbnails from the on - line sss r - band data .",
    "each field plate contains 150 science fibers , with additional bundles used for guiding .",
    "a robot positioner configures the plate for each field by moving each fiber end to the desired position .",
    "the associated mechanical stress occasionally causes the fiber to break , so it needs to be repaired .",
    "a typical fiber is broken after every 2  years of use on average , and is repaired in the next 8 months .",
    "figure [ f02 ] shows the number of fibers which were used successfully to collect star light for each of the 517 pointings .",
    "the number varies with time .",
    "a period of decline is followed by a sharp rise after the repair of broken fibers on the corresponding field plate .",
    "each pointing was typically used to successfully observe 106 stars .",
    "an additional 9 or 10 fibers were used to monitor the sky background .",
    "the light is dispersed by a bench - mounted schmidt - type spectrograph to produce spectra with a resolving power of @xmath18 . the main improvement introduced since the first data release is the use of a blue light blocking filter ( schott og531 ) which blocks the second order spectrum .",
    "this allows for an unambiguous placement of the continuum level and so permits the derivation of values of stellar parameters , in addition to the radial velocity .",
    "the introduction of the blocking filter lowers the number of collected photons by only @xmath19% , so we decided to keep the same observing routine as described in paper  i. the observation of a given field consists of 5 consecutive 10-minute exposures , which are accompanied by flat - field and neon arc calibration frames .",
    "note that we use two field plates on an alternating basis ( fibers from one fiber plate are being configured while we observe with the other field plate ) .",
    "so fibers from a given field plate are mounted to the spectrograph slit prior to observation of each field .",
    "to do this the cover of the spectrograph needs to be removed , so its temperature may change abruptly .",
    "the associated thermal stress implies that it is best to use the flatfield and neon arc lamp exposures obtained immediately after the set of scientific exposures when the spectrograph is largely thermally stabilized .",
    "for all data new to this data release we ensured that such flatfield and arc lamp exposures have been obtained and used in the data reduction .    )",

    "the observations obtained since april 3 2004 yielded data which were not published in paper  i , so they are new to this data release .",
    "statistics on the number of useful nights , of field centers and of stellar spectra are given in table  [ t : obslog ] .",
    "these numbers make the present , second data release about twice as large as the one presented in paper  i. stars were mostly observed only once , but 75 stars from the field centered on r.a .",

    "the data reduction is performed in several steps :    1 .",
    "quality control of the acquired data .",
    "2 .   spectra reduction .",
    "3 .   radial velocity determination and estimation of physical stellar parameters .    in the first step the ravedr software package and plotting tools",
    "are used to make a preliminary estimate of data quality in terms of signal levels , focus quality and of possible interference patterns .",
    "this serves two goals : to quickly determine which observations need to be repeated because of unsatisfactory data quality , and to exclude any problematic data from further reduction steps .",
    "for the first data release 17%  of all pointings were classified as problematic , while in this data release the overall dropout rate fell to 13% .",
    "problematic data are kept separately and are not part of this data release .",
    "the next two steps of the data reduction process are described below .",
    "we use a custom set of iraf routines which have been described in detail in paper  i. here we highlight only the improvements introduced for reduction of data new to this data release .    the use of the blue light blocking filter permits a more accurate flatfielding of the data .",
    "the spectra have a length of 1031 pixels , and are found to cover a wavelength interval of @xmath23   .",
    "the resolving power is the same as estimated in paper  i , we use the value of @xmath24 throughout .",
    "the camera of the spectrograph has a very fast focal ratio ( f/1 ) .",
    "the associated optical aberrations at large off - axis angles imply that the central wavelength of the spectrograph is not constant , but depends on the fiber number ( figure  [ f04 ] ) .",
    "this means that the wavelengths covered by a spectrum depend on its fiber number .",
    "also any residual cross ",
    "talk between the spectra in adjacent fibers is generally shifted in wavelength .",
    "this makes an iterative procedure to remove illumination from adjacent fibers even more important ( see paper  i for details ) .",
    "the peak of central wavelengths around the half - point of their distribution shows that our instrumental setup remained quite stable for one year when the data new to this data release were obtained .",
    "the determination of radial velocity and stellar parameters is based on the 788 pixels of the central part of the wavelength range only ( @xmath25    @xmath26   ) .",
    "this avoids telluric absorption lines and a ghost image caused by internal reflections of non - dispersed light at the borders of the wavelength range which are occasionally present and could jeopardize the results , as described in paper  i. the edges of the spectral interval are avoided also because of a poorer focus , lower resolving power and a lower quality of the wavelength calibration .",
    "figure  [ f : countsidenis ] plots the average adu count level of the central part of the final 1-d spectrum , and per one hour of exposure time , as a function of denis @xmath13 magnitude .",
    "only data new to this data release are plotted .",
    "the line follows the relation @xmath27 where the constant term is the mode of the magnitude corrected count distribution .",
    "these count levels are 0.25  mag below those in paper  i. the difference is due to the 2nd order blocking filter .",
    "note however that the filter allowed for a more accurate flatfielding , and so better determined count levels .",
    "this information has been used in data quality control .",
    "shades of grey code the number of spectra in a certain bin , as given in the key .",

    "[ e : countsvsi ] .",
    ", width=479 ]      the general routine stayed the same as described in detail in paper  i. radial velocities are computed from sky - subtracted normalized spectra , while sky unsubtracted spectra are used to compute the zero - point correction .",
    "the latter is needed because of thermal variations of the spectrograph which cause a shift of the order of one tenth of a pixel or 1.5  .",
    "radial velocities are computed from cross - correlation with an extensive library of synthetic spectra .",
    "a set of 57,943 spectra degraded to the resolving power of rave from @xcite is used .",
    "it is based on the latest generation of kurucz models .",
    "it covers all loci of non - degenerate stars in the h - r diagram , with metallicities in the range of @xmath29 \\le + 0.5 $ ] .",
    "most spectra have a microturbulent velocity of 2  ( with additional entries for 1 and 4 ) , while the @xmath30 enhancements of @xmath31 and @xmath32 are used .",
    "the use of the blue blocking filter simplifies the computations , as no contribution from the 2nd order spectrum needs to be considered . both the observed spectra and theoretical templates are normalized prior to the radial velocity measurement .",
    "we use iraf s task _ continuum _ with a two - piece cubic spline .",
    "the rejection criteria used in 10 consecutive iterations of the continuum level are asymmetric ( 1.5-@xmath33 low and 3-@xmath33 high ) .",
    "kurucz synthetic spectra used in cross - correlation do not include corrections of radial velocity due to convective motions in the stellar atmosphere or due to a gravitational redshift of light leaving the star ( f.  castelli , private communication ) .",
    "the combined shift is in the range of 0.4  for f dwarfs to + 0.4  for k dwarfs @xcite , while the near absence of gravitational redshift in giants causes a @xmath34   shift between giants and dwarfs .",
    "the exact value of these corrections is difficult to calculate , so we follow the resolution c1 of the iau general assembly in manchester @xcite and report the heliocentric radial velocities without corrections for gravitational or convective shifts in the stellar atmosphere .",
    "note however that these values may be different from the line - of - sight component of the velocity of the stellar center of mass @xcite .    in the final data product",
    "we report the heliocentric radial velocity and its error , together with the value of the applied zero - point velocity correction , the radial velocity of sky lines and their correlation properties .",
    "a detailed description of the data release is given in section  [ secondrelease ] .",
    "the name of the survey suggests that rave is predominantly a radial velocity survey .",
    "however , the spectral type of the survey stars is generally not known and the input catalog does not use any color criterion , so rave stars are expected to include all evolutionary stages and a wide range of masses in the h - r diagram .",
    "the properties of the stellar spectra in the wavelength interval used by rave strongly depend on the values of the stellar parameters @xcite .",
    "while the ca  ii ir triplet is almost always present , the occurrence and strength of paschen , metallic and molecular lines depends on temperature , gravity and metallicity ( see e.g.  figure  4 in @xcite ) . so we can not adopt the common practice of using a small number of spectral templates to derive the radial velocity alone , as it has been commonly done at , e.g. , the elodie spectrograph at ohp .",
    "we therefore construct the best matching template from a large library of synthetic kurucz spectra ( see sec .",
    "[ radialvelocitydetermination ] ) .",
    "the parameters of the best matching spectrum are assumed to present the true physical parameters in the stellar atmosphere .",
    "two comments are in order before we outline the template spectrum construction method .",
    "first , the template library only covers normal stars .",
    "so peculiar objects can not be classified correctly .",
    "such objects include double lined spectroscopic binaries and emission line objects .",
    "sometimes a peculiar nature of the spectrum can be inferred from a poor match of the templates , despite a high s / n ratio of the observed spectrum .",
    "the second important point concerns the non - orthogonality of the physical parameters we use .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure  [ f06 ] : the wavelength ranges with flux levels sensitive to a change in temperature overlap with those sensitive to metallicity and the rotational velocity . on the other hand sensitivity to changes in both gravity and temperature",
    "depend on spectral type and class .",
    "the intermittent lines in figure  [ f06 ] mark wavelengths where the normalized flux level changes for at least @xmath35%  if the value of one of the parameters is modified by a given amount ( temperature by 500  k , gravity or metallicity by 0.5  dex , or rotational velocity by 30  ) .",
    "we note that a 3%  change is marginally detectable in a typical rave spectrum with s / n  @xmath36 , but the non - orthogonality of individual parameters can present a serious problem ( see also figure  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "if the temperature or gravity would be known _ a priori _ , the ambiguities would be largely resolved .",
    "an obvious idea is to use photometric colors to constrain the value of stellar temperature .",
    "unfortunately the errors of current photometric surveys are too large : a change of 0.03  mag in @xmath37 corresponds to a shift of 230  k in temperature in a mid - g main sequence star .",
    "also , stellar colors may be seriously compromised by interstellar extinction or by stellar binarity .",
    "we therefore decided not to use any outside information but to base our estimates of stellar parameters exclusively on spectral matching .",
    "this may change in the future when results of multicolor and multi - epoch all - sky photometric surveys such as skymapper @xcite will become available .",
    "our parameter estimation procedure makes use of a full set of theoretical templates .",
    "they span a grid in 6 parameters : temperature , gravity , metallicity , @xmath30 enhancement , microturbulent and rotational velocity .",
    "the sampling in gravity , metallicity , and temperature is very good , with @xmath38 tabulated values for the former two and even more for the temperature . on the other hand",
    "the current synthetic library contains only one non - solar @xmath30 enhancement value ( @xmath39 ) and only up to 3 values of microturbulent velocity ( 1 , 2 , 4 , but only 2  is available for the whole grid ) .",
    "so we decided to publish values of temperature , gravity and metallicity .",
    "the alpha enhancement values are also listed but they should be interpreted with caution , as they are derived from 2 grid values only .",
    "these two values may not span the whole range of @xmath30 enhancement which is present in nature .",
    "also the error of @xmath30 enhancement can be comparable to the whole range of the grid in this parameter ( see sec .",
    "[ methodvalidation ] ) .",
    "microturbulent velocity values are not published , because their errors are typically much larger than the range of microturbulent velocities in the grid .",
    "similarly , the rather low resolving power of rave spectra does not allow the determination of rotational velocities ( @xmath40 ) for slow rotators which represent the vast majority of rave stars .",
    "hence the rotational velocity is not published , but fast rotators will be discussed in a separate paper .",
    "so we aim at the estimation of three stellar parameters : effective temperature ( @xmath41 ) , gravity ( @xmath42 ) , and metallicity ( @xmath43 ) . the adopted reference system of these parameters is the latest set of kurucz template spectra .",
    "next we describe the inverse method used to derive values of stellar parameters .      to derive the stellar parameters , we use a penalized @xmath2 technique to construct a synthetic spectrum matching the observed spectrum ( for other uses of similar methods see for example @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the observed spectrum is modelled as a weighted sum of template spectra with known parameters and it is assumed that the stellar parameters follow the same weight relation . the continuous problem is therefore written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the spectrum we want the stellar parameters for , @xmath46 are the template spectra with known stellar parameters @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the stellar parameter set we want to measure and @xmath49 is the weight function we try to recover . in the perfect case , where we have an infinite number of template spectra and",
    "the observed spectrum depends only on the stellar parameters ( perfect match between the observed and model spectra ) , @xmath50 . in a real case where noise plays an important role and a real spectrum",
    "can not be perfectly reproduced , @xmath49 is not a dirac function but a smooth function which is non - zero on a limited range .",
    "also , we have the additional constraint @xmath51 .",
    "+ in the more general case , we have access to a limited number of templates and the problem becomes discrete .",
    "the problem then can be rewritten as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the discrete form of @xmath49 .",
    "this problem is ill - conditioned , the number of template spectra being larger than the number of pixels , and the information contained in a spectrum being largely redundant .",
    "therefore , we make use of penalization terms to regularize the solution .",
    "also , the recovered weights must be positive to have a physical meaning , which changes the problem from linear to non - linear .",
    "the following paragraphs will present briefly the linear problem which has a well defined solution before entering the realm of the non - linear problem . for a full discussion and description of the method",

    "has also advantages .",
    "first , we will obtain a physically motivated solution ( with positive or null weights everywhere ) then , imposing positivity reduces significantly the allowed parameter space and reduces the level of gibbs phenomenon ( or ringing artifacts ) in the solution .",
    "this comes at the price of a higher computing time and asymmetric ( non gaussian ) errors .",
    "+ to ensure that the weights are positive , we pose @xmath83 and solve eq .  [",

    "note that in the last equation , the regularization operator @xmath71 has been split in a set of regularization operators each with its own lagrange parameter .",
    "the penalization operators will be discussed in the next section .",
    "we mentioned that in the linear case , the gcv provides an optimal value for the lagrange parameter however , in the non - linear case , this definition is no longer valid .",
    "also , no method is known that allows a quick estimate of the optimal @xmath72s for the non linear problem . in our case",
    ", we estimate the proper lagrange parameter values by means of numerical simulations using synthetic spectra and gaussian noise .",
    "the @xmath72s used in the pipeline were chosen to optimize the computation time and the accuracy ( highest possible accuracy in a minimal computation time ) .",
    "it must be stressed here that the lagrange parameters , obtained from numerical simulations , may not be optimal as the simulations can not cover all the parameter space and as the idealized simulations do not incorporate all the ingredients of a real spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , the simulations allow us to find a solution for the lagrange parameters matching predefined requirements .",
    "+ finally , using the exponential transform can cause the solution to be unbound .",
    "for example , we expect the weights of spectra far away from the true solution to be zero . in this case , for @xmath90 , @xmath91 and the solution is unbound .",
    "this problem can be solved using an additional term in the regularization , penalizing solutions where @xmath92 becomes lower than a predefined threshold .",
    "for example , in the case of continuum subtracted spectra , the threshold can be set from @xmath93 to @xmath94 , @xmath95 being the number of spectra in the library , ensuring that the contribution of a template spectrum away from the solution is negligible .",
    "the problem of determining the stellar parameters from a rave spectrum is ill - conditioned and requires regularization in order to recover a physically meaningful solution .",
    "also , the size of the synthetic spectra library we are using is too large to enable us to process a rave spectrum within a realistic time frame considering the number of spectra to process .",
    "our first operation reduces the size of the parameter space by selecting templates according to a @xmath2 criterion .",

    "this selection criterion avoids potential problems where the noise , ghost or cosmic rays create spurious minima which could lead to biases in the estimated stellar parameters .",
    "care must be taken when selecting the @xmath2 limit as , if the number of spectra in the subset of templates is not large enough , biases can be introduced in the solution .",
    "the limit @xmath101 was chosen according to numerical simulation using the synthetic template library .",
    "simulations have shown that , using eq .",
    "[ e : qnonlinear ] , at least the 150 template spectra from the lowest @xmath2 must be used to minimize the reconstruction errors and avoid biases . as those simulations were run using idealized spectra , in practice @xmath101",
    "is set to the 300@xmath102 lowest @xmath2 for a given spectrum .",
    "this leads to a subsample of the library containing between 2 and 4 values per parameter , depending on the location in the parameter space .",
    "this number is lower than @xmath103 which would be the number of spectra used for a quadratic interpolation on a complete 6d grid , and is due to the fact that the stellar parameter space is not evenly covered by the library .",
    "the average number of direct neighbors ( on a grid point next to a given parameter ) is 85 , varying between 1 and 314 .",
    "+ reducing the number of template spectra does not solve the ill - conditioned nature of the problem , even if the number of templates becomes lower than the number of pixels .",
    "this is due to the fact that the pixel values are not independent and the information on effective temperature , gravity etc .",

    "the neighborhood is set to the 40 closest points in @xmath115 which is approximately half the average number of neighbors .",

    "these three ingredients were added to mimic observed and expected features in the rave spectra : random noise level typical of the rave spectra , a mean internal rv error of @xmath1265  km / s after the 1@xmath127 rv estimation and residual continuum features that can be left after data reduction .",

    "also , a smoothing was applied to the right panel for the visualization , to lower the effect of the noise .",
    "these simulations enable us to assess the expected dependencies of our errors as a function of the various stellar parameters .",
    "the main characteristics we observe are :    * below 8000  k , there is little dependence of the recovered parameters on @xmath41 but for @xmath41 itself with an overestimation that increases as the effective temperature becomes larger .",

    "* @xmath42 is better constrained in hot spectra than in cool spectra .",
    "* @xmath41 is systematically underestimated for hot spectra .",
    "the overall accuracy we can expect for the stellar parameters in the rave regime ranges then from 200  k to 500  k for @xmath41 , 0.2 to 0.5  dex for @xmath131 and 0.1 to 0.4  dex for [ m / h ] ( depending on the value of @xmath30 enhancement ) while @xmath130 alone is not recovered .",
    "a better understanding of the relations and mutual influences of the errors on the stellar parameters is gained from the correlations between the reconstruction errors .",
    "these are presented in fig .",
    "[ errorcorrel ] where the different behavior of the hot stars and of the cool stars is apparent .",
    "the upper triangle presents the correlations between the errors for the cool stars while the lower triangle shows the correlation for the hot spectra ( the lower triangle has been smoothed for visual rendering ) .",
    "it is clear in this figure that in the cool spectra regime , the errors on the parameter reconstruction are strongly correlated which indicates that an error on one parameter results in errors on the other parameters .",
    "there is however an exception for @xmath130 which is only anti - correlated to [ m / h ] and not correlated to the other parameters which further indicates that only a combination of [ m / h ] and @xmath130 is recovered , and that these two quantities can not be uniquely separated .",
    "the situation is different for the hot stars , where the only visible correlation is between @xmath41 and [ m / h ] and only for large errors on [ m / h ] .",
    "otherwise , no correlation is seen indicating that the system is better constrained .",
    "nevertheless , typical errors for hot stars are larger than for cool stars with similar noise levels .     above 8000  k.",
    "the color coding follows the number density per bin.,width=555 ]    overall , the method presented allows us to recover the stellar parameters with a good accuracy knowing that our wavelength interval is small and our resolution is limited ( r@xmath1267500 ) .",
    "the expected correlations between the reconstruction errors for the different parameters are well behaved ( simple one mode correlations ) if one is able to distinguish a posteriori the two cases , hot and cool stars .      the initial estimate of the signal to noise ( s / n ) comes from comparison of 1-d spectra derived from typically 5 subexposures of a given field ( see paper  i for details ) .",
    "this estimate is model independent and readily available for the calculation of @xmath2 for the radial velocity and stellar parameter determination routines .",
    "however any change of observing conditions during the observing run may contribute to differences of subexposure spectra and therefore render the value of s / n too low .",
    "we therefore wrote a procedure which calculates the s / n from the final spectrum only .",
    "we refer to it as the s2n value in the data release , while the one calculated from subexposure variation is labeled snr .",
    "line - free regions in observed spectra are very scarce .",
    "moreover , the spectra are quite noisy , so one does not know _ a priori _ if an apparently line - free region does not hide weak absorption lines .",
    "so it seems obvious that suitable regions should be chosen by comparison of the observed spectrum to the best matching template .",
    "the procedure is as follows :    1 .   the _ normalized _ final observed spectrum ( shifted and resampled to the rest frame )",
    "is compared with the synthetic library template with the best correlation .",
    "the two spectra are not identical for two reasons : noise in the observed spectrum and systematic deviations ( due to observational or theoretical computation deficiencies ) .",
    "we want to avoid the latter .",
    "the difference between the observed and theoretical spectrum often alternates in sign between consecutive wavelength pixels if it is due to noise . but systematics usually affect several adjacent wavelength bins , so the sign of the difference does not vary so frequently .",
    "we therefore decided to use only those pixels for which the difference changes sign from the previous _ or _ towards the next adjacent pixel .",
    "this selection scheme retains 75%  of all pixels if the reason for variation is just noise .",
    "this seems a reasonable price to pay in order to avoid systematics .",
    "note that we impose restrictions only on the _ sign _ of the difference , not on its absolute value , so noise properties are not affected .",
    "2 .   regions of strong spectral lines are prone to systematic errors .",
    "so we discard any pixel for which the flux of the template would be less than 0.9 of the continuum flux .",
    "strong spectral lines span a small fraction of the entire spectral range , except in high temperature objects .",
    "the derived s / n estimate is representative of the continuum s / n , but the value generally does not differ by more than 5 - 10%   from the s / n averaged over the whole spectrum .",
    "next we calculate the difference between the observed and theoretical spectrum , and divide it by the theoretical spectrum flux .",
    "the final s2n estimate is an inverse of its standard deviation , of course only using the pixels retained in the steps above .",
    "4 .   the observed spectra we used for the three steps above",
    "are shifted to the rest frame and resampled with respect to the original ones given in observed wavelengths .",
    "this is important , as resampling damps the pixel to pixel variation and therefore artificially increases the measured value of the signal to noise .",
    "so we need to take it into account .",
    "the resampled and the original spectrum have the same number of pixels , so resampling can be characterized by its average fractional - pixel shift .",
    "a zero shift obviously does nothing , but a shift of half a pixel means that the s / n estimate measured in previous steps needs to be multiplied by a factor of @xmath132 . if the shift is a fraction @xmath133 of the pixel separation , the expression for the damping factor @xmath134 .",
    "the s / n value calculated by the 3 steps above needs to be multiplied by this damping factor to obtain the final s2n estimate of the observed spectrum . in the case of rave data the fractional shift of pixels at both edges of",
    "the spectrum is zero , while the pixels in - between are resampled from an observed non - linear to a linear increase of wavelength with pixel number .",
    "because this non - linearity is always very similar also the resulting damping factor turns out to be well constrained : @xmath135 .",
    "this value is actually very close to 0.805 obtained for a uniform distribution of fractional pixel shifts @xmath133 in the @xmath136 $ ] interval .",
    "the first two points limit the fraction of pixels used in the s2n estimate to @xmath137 .",
    "this is true also for hot stars , so the selection outlined above does not seem to be too constraining .",
    "note that step 4 means that the s2n values are lower than the ones calculated by e.g.  the _ splot _ package of iraf , because the latter does not take into account the effects of resampling .",
    "the snr estimate is very sensitive to variations of atmosphere transparency and instrumental effects during the observing sequence while the s2n is not .",
    "so s2n values are similar to the snr ones , with the average value of s2n being @xmath138%  higher .",

    "the blue light blocking filter , which cuts the second order light and was used for data new to this release , clearly improves the match between theoretical templates and observed spectra .",
    "this is mostly a consequence of the more accurate flatfielding of a rather narrow spectral range of the first order light , compared to a mix of relative contributions of the first and the second order spectra which emphasizes any differences in the color temperature between the star and the calibration lamp .",

    "the aim of this section is to provide a calibration relation that transforms the uncalibrated metallicities , derived by the @xmath2 method , to the calibrated ones , which are in line with the metallicity system of the above mentioned datasets .",
    "the trends can be represented with a linear relationship , there is no indication of quadratic terms .",
    "so we assume that the calibrated metallicity @xmath43 is given by the relation @xmath173 where all parameters on the right refer to the values derived by the rave pipeline ( section [ estimationofstellarparameters ] ) and @xmath174 are constants .",
    "figure [ origmetcomparison ] contains a few outliers , so there is a danger that the fit is driven by these points and not by general trends .",
    "the fit is therefore performed twice and after the first fit we reject 5%  of the most deviating points .",
    "such a clipping does not decrease the number of calibration points significantly , still it effectively avoids outliers .",
    "it is not obvious whether all parameters in equation [ formmetallicityrelation ] need to be used .",
    "so we tested a range of solutions , using between 1 and 5 free parameters .",
    "it turns out that the main parameters are metallicity , @xmath30 enhancement , and gravity , while for the temperature parameter ( @xmath175 ) improvement of the goodness of fit is not significant . also , the calibrating datasets cover a limited range in temperature , so this parameter is not sampled over its whole physical span .",
    "so we decided not to use temperature for the calibration of the metallicity .",
    "the final form of the calibration relation is @xmath176 where @xmath43 and @xmath163 denote the calibrated and the uncalibrated metallicities , respectively .",
    "this convention shall be used throughout the paper .",
    "calibration nicely removes the trends mentioned before .",
    "note that the gravity term nearly cancels the constant offset for main sequence stars .",
    "its inclusion in the relation [ calibrationrelation ] is further justified by the fact that larger discrepancies in metallicity are constrained to lower gravities .",
    "inclusion of @xmath30 enhancement ( @xmath130 ) in the calibration relation may seem a bit problematic .",
    "its value is not known a priori , and we said in sec .",
    "[ methodvalidation ] that it can not be accurately recovered by the rave pipeline ( see the upper right panel of fig .  [",
    "f : reconserror ] ) . a typical recovery error of up to 0.15  dex makes @xmath130 values derived by rave hardly useful to decide if a certain star has an enhanced abundance of elements produced by capture of @xmath30 particles or not .",
    "the reason is that the whole range of this parameter amounts to only 0.4  dex , i.e.  not much larger than the recovery error . on the other hand the @xmath130 values derived by rave are not random",
    ", so they statistically improve the accuracy of derived metallicity .",
    "a factor of 0.767 implies that they increase it by up to 0.3  dex in extremely @xmath30 enhanced stars .",
    "so , even though an accurate value of @xmath130 can not be derived by rave , we know that its value is changing from star to star .",
    "in fact the enhancement of @xmath30 elements is the first improvement on the abundance modelling of stars which reaches past the uniform scaling of solar abundances .",
    "rave stars are expected to show much of a variation in this parameter , as we are covering a wide range of stars from local dwarfs to the rather distant supergiants well above the galactic plane .",
    "this is also the reason we included variation of @xmath30 enhancement in the method to determine stellar parameters . if the value of @xmath130 were held fixed , or if it were calculated by some arbitrary relation , the resulting metallicity would be biased , with values shifted by up to 0.3  dex .",
    "we try to avoid such biases , so @xmath130 is part of the spectral processing , even though it can not be accurately recovered .",
    "the need for a metallicity calibration can be partly also due to our choice of the wavelength range . the largest contributors of strong absorption lines in rave spectra ( for stars dominating the observed stellar population ) are ca  ii , si  i , mg  i , ti  i , and fe  i. all but the last one are produced by the capture of @xmath30 particles . for the spectral type k0  iii we have 54 prominent spectral lines of 3 @xmath30-elements ( si  i , mg  i , and ti  i ) and 60 fe  i lines of similar strength .",
    "so @xmath30-elements produce a similar number of lines as iron , not counting the _ very _ strong lines of @xmath30-element ca  ii which actually dominate any @xmath2 fit .",
    "so , when the rave pipeline tries to match the metallic content , the fits pointing to an enhanced @xmath30 abundance or an increased metallicity are similar . as a result",
    "the pipeline may split the effect of metallicity in two parts , in the sense that it partly modifies the metallicity and partly adjusts the @xmath30 enhancement .",

    "individual element abundances frequently scatter by 0.2 or 0.3  dex if compared to the iron abundance @xcite .",
    "this fact of nature is also the cause of a large scatter of metallicity vs.  iron abundance in the soubiran sample , depicted by grey points in figure  [ genevasoubiran ] .",
    "the metallicity change of 0.20.3  dex , as introduced by the calibration relation , is therefore comparable to the intrinsic scatter of individual element abundances in stars .",

    "equation  [ eq : mhfromfeh ] therefore reflects only approximate general trends .",
    "nevertheless it allows us to check that the distribution of the calibrated metallicities derived by rave is consistent with the predictions of the besanon galactic model .",
    "errors associated with a given stellar parameter depend on the s / n ratio of the spectrum and on the spectral properties of the star .",
    "we discuss them in turn .",
    "the calibration data have very different values of s / n , in general higher than typical rave survey data .",
    "the average s / n ratio for the survey stars for which we publish values of stellar parameters is 41 .",
    "so we choose s / n  =  40 as the reference value of s / n .",
    "the error estimate @xmath186 below therefore refers to a star with s / n  =  40 .",
    "extensive monte carlo simulations show that the error @xmath33 for a stellar parameter has the following scaling with the s / n of the observed spectrum : @xmath187 where @xmath188 and the coefficient @xmath110 has the value of @xmath189 for temperature , @xmath190 for gravity and @xmath191 for metallicity .",
    "the simulations used 63 high s / n spectra observed by rave for which also high resolution echelle spectroscopy has been obtained in asiago or at the apo .",
    "we assumed that the analysis of echelle spectroscopy yields the true values of the parameters for these stars and studied how the values derived by the rave pipeline would worsen if additional gaussian noise was added to the rave spectra .",
    "we found that the offsets in mean values of stellar parameters appear only at @xmath192 ( an offset in temperature at s / n=6 is 100  k ) and disappear at higher s / n ratios .",
    "gaussian noise is not the only source of the problems with weak signal spectra .",
    "systematic effects due to scattered light , fiber crosstalk , and incomplete removal of flatfield interference patterns are preventing a reliable parameter determination in a large fraction of spectra with @xmath193 .",
    "so we decided to publish radial velocities down to @xmath194 , while stellar parameter values are published only for spectra with @xmath195 .",
    "the latter decision influences @xmath196%  of rave spectra which have @xmath197 .    simulations also show that the errors on the parameters do not continue to improve for stars with @xmath198 , because systematic errors tend to dominate over statistical noise in such low  noise cases .",
    "so we flatten out the error decrease for @xmath199 in equation ( [ requation ] ) .    the choice of the reference signal to noise ratio of 40 means that the errors discussed below should be about twice larger for the noisiest spectra with published parameters , and about twice smaller for spectra with the largest ratio of signal to noise .",
    "the calibration datasets ( table  [ t : externalparametersets ] ) contain only stars hotter than 4000  k and cooler than 7500  k. the majority of these stars are on or close to the main sequence with a metallicity similar to the solar value .",
    "many of the rave program stars are of this type , but not all .",
    "for example one can not judge the errors of hot stars or very metal poor stars from these datasets .",

    "relative errors are estimated from a theoretical grid of kurucz models , but the observed calibration datasets are used for the scaling of the relative to absolute error values and for verifying the results .    we start with a theoretical normalized spectrum from the pre - computed kurucz grid and investigate the increase of the root mean square difference ( rms ) when we compare it with grid - point spectra in its vicinity in the 5-dimensional space of @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath130 , and @xmath200 . if we denote the values of five parameters for the initial spectrum as @xmath201 ( @xmath202 ) , and if @xmath203 ( @xmath202 ) denote their values at a grid point in its vicinity , the estimate @xmath204 of an error of parameter @xmath205 for the initial spectrum can be obtained from the minimum of @xmath206 .",
    "we assume that an increase of rms has a similar effect on the parameter estimation as an increase of a noise level .",
    "so @xmath207 is inversely proportional to the s / n of the normalized spectrum , but the dependence of the error @xmath204 of the parameter @xmath205 on the s / n ratio is given by the value of the coefficient @xmath110 in the equation [ eq : sigma ] .",
    "the only remaining factor is the proportionality constant .",
    "it is derived by the assumption that 68.2%  of all calibration spectra should have the value of the parameter @xmath205 determined by the rave pipeline within @xmath208 of the reference value .",
    "the scheme allows us to estimate errors in all corners of the parameter space covered by kurucz models , i.e.  even in parts where we lack any calibration spectra .",
    "calibration spectra are used exclusively for scaling of the @xmath186 value of a given stellar parameter in eq .",
    "[ eq : sigma ] .",
    "this scaling was done assuming that @xmath209 of rave calibration objects should have a given parameter within one standard deviation of the true value obtained from high resolution observations .",

    "a positive answer would support the results .",

    "all these trends can be seen from figure  [ f06 ] where wavelength intervals affected by temperature change are marked by red lines .",

    "this is a consequence of the fact that a spectrum of a star may appear as a double lined binary star in one spectrum , and as an entirely normal single star in another one ( taken close to conjunction ) .",
    "so the star would be counted as a member of two types .",
    "a definite classification of all stars in this data release is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we plan to pursue follow - up studies for particular types of objects , like spectroscopic binaries , and present them in separate papers .",
    "repeated observations allow a comparison of the measured properties of these stars .",
    "if we assume that values for a given star do not change with time , the scatter can be used to estimate errors on radial velocity and the values of the stellar parameters .",
    "this assumption may not always be true , for example in the case of binaries or intrinsically variable stars .",
    "so we assumed that the sigma of a parameter is the value which comprises 68.2%  of the differences between the measured values of a parameter and its average value for a given star . this way we minimize the effect of large deviations of ( rare ) variable objects and measure an effective standard deviation of a given parameter .",
    "the data release contains 1,893 objects with 2 or more measurements of radial velocity .",
    "the dispersion of measurements for a particular object is smaller than 1.80  in 68.2%  of the cases , and smaller than 7.9  in 95%  of the cases .    for 822 objects we have also 2 or more spectra with published stellar parameters . in this case",
    "the dispersion of velocities is within 1.66  ( 68.2%  of objects ) and 6.1  ( 95%   of cases ) .",
    "the corresponding scatter in the temperature is 135  k ( 68.2% ) and 393  k ( 95% ) , for gravity 0.2  dex ( 68.2% ) and 0.5  dex ( 95% ) , and for the calibrated metallicity 0.1  dex ( 68.2% ) and 0.2  dex ( 95% ) .",
    "spectra of repeated objects share the same distribution of s / n ratio as all rave stars .",
    "their typical s / n ratio of 40 is smaller than for the reference datasets ( see fig .",
    "[ f10 ] ) , still the above quoted value for the dispersion of radial velocities is similar to the errors of the reference datasets ( table  [ t : rvaccuracy ] ) .",
    "also the dispersions of stellar parameter values as derived from the repeated observations are smaller than the dispersions for the reference datasets ( table  [ t : zeropointparameteroffsets ] ) .",
    "one expects a higher internal consistency of the repeated observations , as these are free from zero point errors .",
    "but the zero point errors are very small for both radial velocity and stellar parameters ( tables [ t : rvaccuracy ] and [ t : zeropointparameteroffsets ] ) .",
    "note that our error estimates of radial velocity and stellar parameter values are derived assuming that the reference values from the external datasets are error free , and this may not always be the case .",
    "we conclude that the error estimates on radial velocity ( sec .",
    "[ radialvelocityaccuracy ] ) and stellar parameters ( sec .",
    "[ accuracystellarparameters ] ) are quite conservative .",
    "the second public data release of the rave data ( rave dr2 ) is accessible online .",
    "it can be queried or retrieved from the vizier database at the cds , as well as from the rave collaboration website ( www.ravesurvey.org ) .",
    "table  [ t : a1 ] describes its column entries .",
    "the tools to query and extract information are described in paper  i.    the result of the rave survey are radial velocities and values of stellar parameters ( temperature , gravity and metallicity ) .",
    "metallicity is given twice : as coming from the data reduction pipeline ( [ m / h ] ) and after application of calibration equation [ calibrationrelation ] ( [ m / h ] , see section [ calibratingmetallicity ] for details ) .",
    "the latter includes also the value of @xmath30 enhancement .",
    "so the catalog includes also the estimated values of @xmath130 . as explained in section [ errorsotherparams ] this is provided mainly for calibration purposes and is not intended to infer properties of individual objects .",
    "figure  [ aitoffrvs ] plots the general pattern of ( heliocentric ) radial velocities .",
    "the dipole distribution is due to solar motion with respect to the local standard of rest .",
    "spatial coverage away from the galactic plane is rather good , with the exception of stars at small galactic longitudes .",
    "these areas have already been observed and will be part of the next data release .",
    "the investigation of properties of the stellar parameters and their links to galactic dynamics and formation history are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "to illustrate the situation we outline just two plots .",

    "figure  [ parameterhisto ] plots histograms of the parameters , again for different bands in galactic latitude .",
    "the fraction of main sequence stars increases with the distance from the galactic plane .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that the rave targets have rather similar apparent magnitudes ( figure  [ f01 ] ) .",
    "giants therefore trace a more distant population , and those at high latitudes would be already members of the ( scarcely populated ) galactic halo .",

    "the sss catalog suffers from substantial uncertainties , so we now attempted a cross - identification with the ucac2 catalog @xcite .",
    "rave coordinates were used to search for the nearest two neighbors in the ucac2 catalogue .",
    "it turned out that it suffices to use the data for the first next neighbor , as there were no cases where the matching distance to the first neighbor was less than 3 arcsec while that to the second one was less than 6 arcsec .",
    "the ucac2 counterpart within 3  arcsec search radius was identified for 94%  of the spectra , many of the remaining objects have large errors in reported proper motion .",

    "in all cases this data release includes proper motion from the source with the best value of reported accuracy .",
    "this second data release reports radial velocities of 51,829 spectra of 49,327 different stars , randomly selected in the magnitude range of @xmath242 and located more than @xmath179 away from the galactic plane ( except for a few test observations ) .",
    "it covers an area of @xmath243 square degrees .",
    "these numbers approximately double the sample reported in paper  i. moreover , this data release is the first to include values of stellar parameters as determined from stellar spectra .",
    "we report temperature , gravity and metallicity for 21,121 normal stars , all observed after the first data release .",
    "stars with a high rotational velocity or peculiar type ( e.g.  binary stars and emission stars ) will be discussed separately .",
    "radial velocities for stars new in this data release are more accurate than before , with typical errors between 1.3 and 1.7  .",
    "these values are confirmed both by repeated observations and by external datasets and have only a weak dependence on the s / n ratio .",
    "we used five separate external datasets to check values of stellar parameters derived from rave spectra .",
    "these included observations with different instruments at different resolving powers and in different wavelength regimes , as well as data from the literature .",
    "the uncertainty of stellar parameter values strongly depends on stellar type . despite considerable effort our calibration observations do not cover ( yet ) the entire parameter space .",
    "we plan to improve on this using dedicated calibration observations with at least 4 telescopes .",
    "for this data release we had to resort to extensive simulations which are however tuned by calibration observations .",
    "a typical rave star has an uncertainty of 400  k in temperature , 0.5  dex in gravity , and 0.2  dex in metallicity .",
    "the error depends on the signal to noise ratio and can be @xmath244 times better / worse for stars at extremes of the noise range .",
    "repeated observations show that these error estimates are rather conservative , possibly due to intrinsic variability of the observed stars and/or non - negligible errors of reference values from the calibration datasets .",
    "future data releases will follow on an approximately yearly basis .",
    "they will benefit from our considerable and ongoing effort to obtain calibration datasets using other telescopes and similar or complimentary observing techniques .",
    "notably we expect that skymapper @xcite , an all - southern - sky survey just starting at the siding spring observatory , will provide accurate photometry and temporal variability information for all rave stars .",
    "rave is planned to observe up to a million spectra of stars away from the galactic plane .",
    "it represents an unprecedented sample of stellar kinematics and physical properties in the range of magnitudes probing scales between the very local surveys ( geneva copenhagen survey and @xcite ) and more distant ones ( sdssii / segue ) , complementing the planned aaomega efforts closer to the galactic plane .",

    "<S> we present the second data release of the radial velocity experiment ( rave ) , an ambitious spectroscopic survey to measure radial velocities and stellar atmosphere parameters ( temperature , metallicity , surface gravity , and rotational velocity ) of up to one million stars using the 6df multi - object spectrograph on the 1.2-m uk schmidt telescope of the anglo - australian observatory ( aao ) . </S>",
    "<S> the rave program started in 2003 , obtaining medium resolution spectra ( median r=7,500 ) in the ca - triplet region ( @xmath0 8,4108,795  ) for southern hemisphere stars drawn from the tycho-2 and supercosmos catalogues , in the magnitude range @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> following the first data release @xcite the current release doubles the sample of published radial velocities , now containing 51,829 radial velocities for 49,327 individual stars observed on 141 nights between april 11 2003 and march 31 2005 . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with external data sets shows that the new data collected since april 3 2004 show a standard deviation of 1.3  , about twice better than for the first data release . </S>",
    "<S> for the first time this data release contains values of stellar parameters from 22,407 spectra of 21,121 individual stars . </S>",
    "<S> they were derived by a penalized @xmath2 method using an extensive grid of synthetic spectra calculated from the latest version of kurucz stellar atmosphere models . from comparison with external data sets , our conservative estimates of errors of the stellar parameters for a spectrum with an average signal to noise ratio of @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> are 400  k in temperature , 0.5  dex in gravity , and 0.2 dex in metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> we note however that , for all three stellar parameters , the internal errors estimated from repeat rave observations of 822 stars are at least a factor 2 smaller . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the results show no systematic offsets if compared to values derived from photometry or complementary spectroscopic analyses . </S>",
    "<S> the data release includes proper motions from starnet2 , tycho2 , and ucac2 catalogs and photometric measurements from tycho-2 usno - b , denis and 2mass . </S>",
    "<S> the data release can be accessed via the rave webpage : http://www.rave-survey.org and through cds .    </S>",
