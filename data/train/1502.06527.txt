    "details of these experiments are presented below .",
    "the setup of the reflection experiments is shown in fig.[setup ] .",

    "the sample ( lower ) channel supplies microwave radiation to another directional coupler ( -16db ) , which directs the radiation to the sample attached to port [ 3 ] of a semi - rigid coaxial line ( probe ) connected to the port [ 2 ] of the coupler . reflected from the sample signal @xmath116 is guided by the same coax back to the detector , where it interferes with the reference signal @xmath115 . due to a significant difference in lengths of the reference and sample channels variations of the microwave wavelength ( frequency ) yield oscillating interference signal on the detector . at a small microwave amplitude",

    "fast oscillations corresponds to the interference between @xmath115 and @xmath116 , while the slow variations of the signal corresponds mostly to variations of the reference signal @xmath115 .",
    "contributions of the reflected signal @xmath126 to the microwave background are less than 10% and are neglected below . to separate the interference term ( fast oscillations ) from the background a fft filter was applied resulting in the thick curve presented in fig.[z=0](a ) .",

    "the corresponding amplitude of the interference term @xmath129 is shown in fig.[z=0](c ) .",
    "a decrease of the interference amplitude below 2 ghz is related to the decrease of @xmath115 and @xmath130 due to a properties of the couplers , which are designed to work in the range between 2 and 7 ghz .",
    "decrease of the amplitude at high frequencies is related to microwave losses in the coaxial cable ( @xmath131 ) .    when a sample attached to the port [ 3 ] the amplitude of the interference term is @xmath132 , where @xmath125 is the coefficient describing the microwave reflection from the sample .",

    "the impedance depends on contributions from the 50 ohm terminal resistor @xmath84 , contact resistance @xmath26 and the sample . at high frequencies the impedance may contains contributions related to a geometry of the sample holder , in particular , to finite lengths of the mw feeding leads",
    "the change of the microwave reflection due to the superconductivity depends on the coupling between the sample and microwaves .",
    "stronger coupling makes larger temperature variations of the reflection coefficient near the superconducting transition .",

    "@xmath145 @xmath14 is impedance of the coaxial line .    near the superconducting transition",
    "the impedance varies mostly due to the superconducting contributions . to evaluate the strength of the superconducting current @xmath136 we substitute the temperature change of the current @xmath146 in eq.([current_var ] ) between the normal and superconducting states by the superconducting current @xmath136 . in the case of the `` parallel '' electrical connection of the superconducting layer to the end of the coaxial line",
    "the substitution is exact . for the circuit presented in fig .",
    "[ simdiagram ] the relation between two currents is @xmath147 , where @xmath148120 ohm is the normal resistance of the sample .",
    "the contact resistance @xmath26 can be evaluated from the temperature variation of the reflection coefficient @xmath125 .",
    "indeed if the resistance @xmath26 is large in a comparison with the terminal resistance @xmath84 one should expect a small temperature variation of the impedance @xmath135 , since in both normal and superconducting states the current through the resistance @xmath26 and the sample is small .",
    "fig.[reflection](a ) shows that the reflected power @xmath149 is less than 50% in the studied frequency range .",
    "it indicates that the impedance of the sample stage @xmath135 is quite close to the coax impedance @xmath150 : @xmath151 .",
    "neglecting the difference one can related small variations of the reflection coefficient with small variations of the impedance : @xmath152      eqs.([dg ] ) and ( [ dz ] ) yield that at @xmath156 ohm and @xmath157 , which corresponds to fig.[reflection](b ) , the contact resistance @xmath26 is below 70 ohms in the studied frequency range .",
    "thus the relation @xmath158 underestimates the actual superconducting current @xmath147 by about 60% .",
    "this estimation error is much smaller than the observed frequency variations of the nonlinear response and is neglected below .",
    "experiments indicate that at small currents the nonlinear response is proportional to the applied power @xmath24 and , therefore , to the square of the superconducting current @xmath136 .",

    "solid line presents a continuous frequency sweep .",
    "red open circles are obtained from the dependencies presented in fig.[atten](a ) using eq.([resistance_var ] ) .",

    "ghz the obtained coefficient of nonlinearity @xmath165 is in accord with the one obtained in @xmath3 domain experiments in a similar sample ( sample s2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the sample s2 has a slightly higher ( @xmath1661 k ) transition temperature . in the @xmath3 experiments the nonlinear coefficient",
    "was obtained from the relation @xmath167 between the electric field @xmath168 and applied current density @xmath169 , where @xmath170 is the width of samples and @xmath171 is the nonlinear coefficient .",

    "this value is in a quantitative agreement with the one shown in fig.[atten]b at low frequencies .",
    "the correspondence between the nonlinear coefficients obtained by different experimental methods demonstrates that the reflection method provide a reasonable evaluation of the applied microwave current .    in conclusion ,",
