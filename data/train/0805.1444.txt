    "nova sagittarii 1998 was discovered by @xcite on 1998 march 22.4 , and reached maximum brightness of 7.4 mag on march 23.7 ( jones 1998 ) .",
    "the nova was a fast one , with @xmath3  d in visual and @xmath4  d in @xmath5 @xcite .    in an earlier paper ( @xcite , hereafter )",
    "we reported on the presence of two photometric signals , early after the eruption : a coherent @xmath6 = 3.014  h periodicity ( hereafter the primary signal ) , and an unstable @xmath73.09  h signal that decreased by 0.3% during three years of observations ( hereafter the secondary signal ) .",
    "we suggested that the coherent primary signal is the orbital periodicity of the underlying binary system and that the secondary signal is either superhumps or the spin period of a spinning - up magnetic . in the latter interpretation ,",
    "v4633  sgr is an aynchronous polar ( hereafter , ap )  a strongly - magnetic cv in which the primary s spin period marginally differs from the orbital period ( by @xmath8% , see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and the spin - up is caused by the post - eruption contraction of the strongly - coupled , expanded envelope ( see @xcite for a description of the spin dynamics in the prototype , v1500  cyg ) .    preliminary analysis of follow - up observations in 2001 - 2002 revealed the continued decrease of @xmath9 , which measured 3.07  h in 2002 @xcite .",
    "this further strengthned the asynchronous polar interpretation for the system .    here",
    "we report on the results of observations of two additional years , and on the analysis of our whole accumulated data - set , including a reanalysis of the published data .",

    "this initial brightness decline phase ceased in 2001 , when a post - nova roughly stable brightness state of 15.5 - 16  mag has been reached .",
    "in 2003 , a new phase of brightness - decline commenced , and the system faded during the following 4 years by @xmath123  mag to 18 - 19  mag in 2006 at the end of our observations .",

    "[ fig : v4633sgr : periods ] , upper panel ) . in 1999 - 2003 , the period decline - rate was also reduced monotonically by an order of magnitude ( from @xmath20 in 1999 - 2000 to @xmath21 in 2002 - 2003 ) .",
    "finally , the secondary signal was undetectable in the data in 2004 .",
    "proposed two possible interpretations to the secondary signal : a permanent superhump , and more likely , the spin period of a magnetic of an asynchronous polar system .",
    "our results further weaken the permanent superhump interpretation .",
    "the continued decline of @xmath9 further lowers the upper limit of the secondary mass estimated by , thus requiring an exceptionally under - massed secondary , and an extremely evolved cv system to be accounted for ( sec .",
    "4.5 and references therein ) . moreover , the monotonic decrease of @xmath9 over a 5  yr time span is atypical for a permanent superhump signal , which is expected to wander randomly about a mean period that is determined by the mass - ratio of the system .",
    "our results further support the ap model .",
    "in particular , the post - eruption evolution of v4633  sgr bares some remarkable similarities to that of v1500  cyg ( nova cygni 1975 )  the ap prototype , and one of the fastest and brightest novae of the 20th century ( @xmath22  d , @xmath23 , @xcite ) .",
    "nova  cygni displayed some unique photometric features following its eruption .",
    "a few days after outburst , a periodic variation , @xmath8% longer than the @xmath24  min orbital period , was detected , initially in the profiles of emission lines , and shortly after also photometrically ( @xcite ; note that the photomeric orbital modulation became detectably in photometry only 2 years after the eruption ) . in the following 10 days or so",
    ", the period decreased by @xmath8% , synchronizing with the orbital period .",
    "the period continued to decrease by an additional @xmath8% during the following year or so , after which the variation disappeared .",
    "the periodicity , with a marginally shorter period , was rediscovered some 10  yr later in the modulation of the optical circular polarization @xcite , having an increasing trend , with @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the polarized periodicity was naturally associated with the spin of a strongly magnetic , which in turn implied that the early photometric variation was a tracer of the spin evolution following the nova eruption .",
    "the commonly accepted scenario of this evolution was sketched by @xcite .",
    "they proposed that prior to the eruption , v1500  cyg was an ordinary , synchronized polar .",
    "the rapid expansion of the strongly - coupled envelope due to the nova explosion increased the primary s moment of inertia , which lead , owing to the conservation of angular momentum , to the spin - down by @xmath8% .",
    "strong magnetic coupling between the secondary and the expanded envelope during the first few days after the eruption lead to a phase of extremely rapid spin - up ( with @xmath26 ) , which resulted in the resynchronization of the spin and the orbital period .",
    "the contraction of the remnant envelope onto the surface over the next year or so lead to a second spin - up phase , at a rate that is slower by two orders of magnitude .",
    "the photometric spin signal was switched off when the envelope finally collapsed onto the surface and residual nuclear burning ceased .",
    "the spin - down , with a synchronization time scale of @xmath27  yr , which was observed in polarimetry more than a decade later was naturally interpreted as a magnetically - driven synchronization .",
    "v4633  sgr shares some striking observational similarities with v1500  cyg . shortly after their eruption , both novae exhibited a periodicity that was slightly longer ( by @xmath8% - 2.6%)than the orbital period ( in v1500  cyg within a week , and in v4633  sgr after @xmath28  d ) .    in both systems",
    "the signal s period decreased monotonically at a rate of @xmath29 that declined with time ( the second spin - up phase of v1500  cyg ) .",
    "finally , in both cases the unstable signal disappeared a short time after the eruption ( @xmath30  yr and @xmath31  yr , in v1500  cyg and v4633sgr , respectively ) .",
    "these similarities in the post - eruption evolution of v1500  cyg and v4633  sgr further support the ap model that was proposed by for the latter . applying this model to v4633  sgr , and assuming a post - eruption evolution similar to that of v1500  cyg",
    ", we note a number of differences between the two systems .",
    "the earliest measurement of the spin of v4633  sgr , some 40  days after the eruption , yielded a spin period longer than @xmath32 by @xmath33%  about twice the difference measured in v1500  cyg shortly after its eruption  implying either a greater loss of angular momentum in the eruption of v4633  sgr , or a greater increase of the moment of inertia .",
    "this would require either a stronger magnetic field , which would have coupled the ejecta over a longer distance , and/or more mass ejected during the eruption .",
    "we note that because the brightness decline - rate of v4633  sgr ( @xmath34  d ) was longer than in v1500  cyg , the former s should be less massive , and is therefore expected to eject more mass @xcite .",
    "an extremely - rapid spin - up phase which was observed during the first dozen days or so following the v1500  cyg nova eruption was not observed in v4633  sgr , and particularly , no early resynchronization has occurred . as a result , the spin period is longer than @xmath32 in v4633  sgr , whereas in v1500  cyg it is shorter .",
    "the lack of early resynchronization implies that either the strong coupling between the secondary and the envelope that was proposed by @xcite for v1500  cyg was considerably weaker in v4633  sgr .",
    "alternatively , if a rapid spin - up did occur , the desynchronization of the during the eruption of v4633  sgr must have been significantly stronger , implying a much greater loss of angular momentum during the nova eruption .",
    "the spin period decreased over the 5  yr following the eruption by 0.9%  similar to the period decrease in the second spin - up phase of v1500  cyg . if we naively assume an even - density contracting envelope surrounding a , a strong -envelope coupling that effectively causes a rigid - body behavior , angular - momentum conservation , and a @xmath35 envelope , the observed @xmath36 would require an initial @xmath37 envelope  a reasonable figure in the framework of the @xcite model .    finally , the envelope - contraction phase lasted @xmath38  yr in v4633  sgr  more than 4  times longer than in v1500  cyg .",
    "as pointed out by , the longer envelope - contraction time - scale also is expected for the less massive ( @xcite ; note however that analysis of _ xmm - newton _",
    "observations by @xcite suggests that nuclear burning turned off less than 2.5  yr after the outburst ) .",
    "the brightness modulation over the spin period suggests an intrinsic brightness source on the surface , which is non - uniformly distributed .",
    "the turning off in 2004 of this considerable source ( @xmath39% of the total brightness in 2003 ) may account for the renewed fading of the system , perhaps because of reduced accretion due to decreased irradiation of the secondary .",
    "the source of the non - uniform brightness may be a hot spot due to enhanced nuclear burning near the accreting pole , as suggested by @xcite for v1500  cyg .",
    "this would naturally account for the early appearance of the spin modulation , less than 1.5  months after the eruption .",
    "the disappearance of the signal 5  yr later may also be easily explained by the final collapse of the envelope , and the termination of the nuclear burning .    the contracting envelope  the driving mechanism of the spin up , may also have contributed a significant fraction of the primary s brightness variation .",
    "let us once again naively assume a surrounded by an even - density contracting envelope with a mass @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) and an initial post - eruption radius of @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) , a strong -envelope coupling leading to a rigid - body behavior , and angular - momentum conservation .",
    "the initial energy is the sum of the kinetic energy : @xmath44 and the gravitational energy : @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the initial and final angular velocities , and @xmath50% .",
    "the final energy is : @xmath51 and the energy released during the envelope contraction is : @xmath52 @xmath53 inserting typical mass and radius , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , we obtain : @xmath56 @xmath57    these order of magnitude calculations show that only a marginal fraction of the gravitational energy release that is associated with the contraction of the envelope is required for the spinning up of the .",
    "almost all of it , an amount of energy sufficient to maintain an eddington luminosity of @xmath58  erg  s@xmath15 for for 0.1 - 1  years , is radiated away during the envelope s contraction .",
    "because of the strong magnetic field of the that couples it , the hot , ionized envelope can not contract radially , but is forced to accrete along the magnetic - field lines towards the magnetic poles of the .",
    "it is thus reasonable that most of this energy is released near the magnetic poles , becoming a major energy source for a hot spot near one or the two poles , and a significant fraction of the variable brightness component on the white dwarf ( and indeed , of total luminosity of the system ) during these first 5 years .",
    "the heat released at the impinge of the falling materials may also serve as a catalyst to intensify the residual nuclear burning of the hydrogen - rich material that accrets at these locations .",
    "the gravitational energy release near the poles , as well as the intense nuclear burning there , are expected to begin shortly after the eruption , when the envelope starts contracting .",
    "they also should terminate together , when the envelope finally collapses onto the surface .",
    "1 .   time resolved photometry of v4633  sgr between 1998 and 2004 ( three months to six years following the nova eruption ) reveals two ptotometric periodicities in the lc .",
    "the shorter periodicity , @xmath59  min was stable , and is identified as the orbital period of the underlying binary system .",
    "the second periodicity has been shortened monotonically , from @xmath1  min a few weeks after the eruption to @xmath2  min five years later .",
    "we identify this periodicity with the spin of the primary in a magnetic cv , and the decrease as the manifestation of the spin - up due to the contraction of its envelope .",
    "4 .   in 2004",
    "the latter period was no longer detectable in the lc . in the near - synchronous scenario , this marks the final decline of the envelope and the termination of residual nuclear burning on the surface .",
    "v4633 sgr thus seems to be the second known asynchronous polar classical nova .",
