    "throughout this paper , we use the @xmath3-topology on the space of metrics on a manifold .",
    "our main result is the following theorem .",
    "* theorem 1 : * let @xmath0 be a three - manifold ( possibly with boundary ) , and let @xmath1 be a positive integer .",
    "there exists an open nonempty set of metrics on @xmath2 for each of which there are compact embedded minimal surfaces of genus @xmath1 with arbitrarily large area . in fact , these can be chosen to be stable , i.e. , with morse index zero .",
    "although the theorem ensures that there are `` many '' metrics for which we can embed compact genus @xmath1 minimal surfaces of arbitrarily large area , the result is false for a large class of metrics .",
    "namely , a result of choi and wang ( see [ cw ] ) asserts that for any metric in which @xmath2 has ricci curvature bounded below by a positive constant , there is an upper bound on the area of compact embedded minimal surfaces of genus @xmath1 , depending on @xmath1 and the lower bound for @xmath5 .",
    "colding and minicozzi ( see  @xcite ) have already proved theorem 1 for @xmath4 . in section  [ sec : genus2 ] , we will prove the theorem for @xmath6 , with an argument borrowing heavily from the genus one case .",
    "the theorem will then be extended easily to genus greater than two in section  [ sec : highergenus ] .",
    "it remains an open question as to whether or not the theorem remains valid for genus zero , i.e. , embedded minimal 2-spheres .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the standard genus two surface .",
    "this has fundamental group    @xmath8    where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are freely homotopic to meridians of the two handles , where the meridians have the same orientation , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are freely homotopic to lines of latitude of the two handles , where the lines of latitude have the same orientation .",
    "let @xmath13 be a solid genus two surface with a solid genus two surface and two solid tori removed , where the solid tori lie in the same handle of the ambient genus two surface .",
    "this can be pictured as in figure  [ figomega2 ] , where the top and bottom of the picture are identified .",
    "the fundamental group of @xmath13 is @xmath14    where the generators are as follows :    ( i ) : :    @xmath15 and @xmath16 are freely homotopic to meridians    of the two removed solid tori ( clockwise rotation around the two    removed solid tori in figure 1 ) .",
    "( ii ) : :    @xmath17 is freely homotopic to a meridian of the handle of    the removed solid genus two in the same handle of the ambient solid    genus two as the removed solid tori ( clockwise rotation around the    left handle of the removed solid genus two in figure 1 ) .",
    "( iii ) : :    @xmath18 is freely homotopic to a line of latitude of the    left handle of the ambient solid genus two in figure 1 .",
    "( iv ) : :    @xmath19 is freely homotopic to a meridian of the removed    solid genus two in the other handle from the meridian which is freely    homotopic to @xmath17 ( clockwise rotation around the right    handle of the removed solid genus two in figure 1 ) .",
    "( v ) : :    @xmath20 is freely homotopic to a line of latitude of the    right handle of the ambient solid genus two in figure 1 , with the same    orientation as the line of latitude which is freely homotopic to    @xmath18 .",
    "before we give the proof of theorem 1 for the genus two case , we need the following proposition , whose proof is inspired by a calculation in  @xcite .",
    "* proposition 1 : * let @xmath21 be a compact riemannian manifold with boundary and dimension @xmath22 . then , the set of metrics on @xmath23 in which @xmath23 is strictly mean convex is open and nonempty .",
    "* proof : * the set of such metrics is clearly open , by the definition of strictly mean convex . to show it is nonempty ,",
    "let @xmath24 be any metric on @xmath23 , and let @xmath25 be a metric conformally related to @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath26 be a framing for @xmath23 so that @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the unit normal to @xmath29 in @xmath24 ( and therefore , @xmath30 is the unit normal to @xmath29 in @xmath31 ) .",
    "fix a point @xmath32 , and choose coordinates @xmath33 at @xmath34 so that , at @xmath34 , @xmath35 for all @xmath36",
    ". then , the second fundamental form of @xmath29 in @xmath24 at @xmath34 is given by , for @xmath37 , @xmath38 and the mean curvature of @xmath29 in @xmath24 at @xmath34 is given by @xmath39    the second fundamental form of @xmath29 in @xmath31 at @xmath34 is given by , for @xmath37 , @xmath40 now ,    @xmath41    where , for example ,    @xmath42    so , at @xmath34 , @xmath43 since @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the normal derivative of @xmath46 with respect to the unit normal @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath47    the mean curvature of @xmath29 in @xmath31 at @xmath34 is then given by @xmath48 we have shown that this relation holds at an arbitrarily chosen point of @xmath29 , and so it holds everywhere on @xmath29 since all quantities involved are tensorial .",
    "let @xmath49 be the minimum of @xmath50 on @xmath29 , which exists since @xmath29 is compact .",
    "choose @xmath46 so that @xmath51 everywhere on @xmath29 and @xmath52 outside a small tubular neighborhood around @xmath29 .",
    "then , @xmath53 except for a small tubular neighborhood around @xmath29 , and @xmath54 everywhere on @xmath29 , so @xmath31 is a metric in which @xmath23 is strictly mean convex .",
    "this completes the proof of proposition 1 .    to prove theorem 1",
    ", we will also need the following lemma .    * lemma 1 : * let @xmath55 be a compact riemannian manifold , and let @xmath56 be a sequence of stable , compact , connected , embedded minimal surfaces without boundary such that the following conditions hold :    ( i ) : :    there exists a constant @xmath57 such that    area@xmath58 for all @xmath59 . (",
    "ii ) : :    there exists a constant @xmath60 such that    +    @xmath61 for all @xmath59 ,    where @xmath62 is the second fundamental form of    @xmath63 .",
    "then , a subsequence of @xmath64 converges to a compact , connected , embedded minimal surface without boundary @xmath65 of finite multiplicity .",
    "* proof : * take a finite covering @xmath66 of @xmath67 so that @xmath68 is still a covering of @xmath67 .",
    "then , by  @xcite , a subsequence of @xmath64 converges in each @xmath69 to a lamination @xmath2 with minimal leaves . by taking a diagonal subsequence",
    ", we have a subsequence of @xmath64 , which we still call @xmath64 , converging to @xmath2 everywhere .",
    "@xmath2 is clearly minimal , and it is embedded by the maximum principle .",
    "we claim that the number of leaves of @xmath63 in each @xmath70 which intersect @xmath69 has an upper bound which is uniform in @xmath59 and @xmath71 .",
    "let @xmath72 be any such leaf .",
    "then , there exists @xmath73 .",
    "so , @xmath74 , and by monotonicity of area , there exists a constant @xmath75 so that    @xmath76 so , each @xmath72 is of at least some fixed positive area , and so the area bound @xmath77 gives an upper bound for the number of such leaves which is uniform in @xmath59 and @xmath71 .",
    "we can take a subsequence so that the number of leaves of @xmath63 is the same in each @xmath69 for all @xmath78",
    ". then , the limit @xmath2 must have finite multiplicity , although the multiplicity may be different in each connected component of @xmath2 .",
    "we have shown that each connected component of @xmath2 is a closed surface .",
    "the diameter of @xmath2 is bounded , since @xmath2 is covered by finitely many balls @xmath79 .",
    "so , @xmath2 is compact .",
    "@xmath2 is without boundary since each @xmath63 is without boundary .",
    "it remains to show that @xmath2 is connected , which would imply that @xmath80 with fixed finite multiplicity .",
    "suppose @xmath2 is not connected , and let @xmath81 and @xmath82 be distinct connected components of @xmath2 .",
    "then , @xmath83 . let @xmath84 .",
    "so , @xmath85 is disjoint from both @xmath81 and @xmath82 . since @xmath80 ,",
    "for large enough @xmath59 we have @xmath86 and @xmath87 , but @xmath88 , contradicting the connectedness of @xmath63 .",
    "so , @xmath2 is connected .",
    "therefore , @xmath63 converges to a compact , connected , embedded minimal surface without boundary @xmath65 of finite multiplicity .",
    "this completes the proof of lemma 1 .",
    "* proof of theorem 1 for @xmath6 : *    given any three - manifold @xmath2 , we can embed @xmath13 in @xmath2 .",
    "choose a metric @xmath24 on @xmath2 so that @xmath13 is strictly mean convex ( by proposition 1 , the set of such @xmath24 s is open and nonempty ) .",
    "let @xmath89 be a map such that the induced map @xmath90 is the following : @xmath91 it is easy to see that there exist such maps @xmath92 which are embeddings .",
    "one can check that @xmath93 minimizes the word metric for its conjugacy class : by conjugating @xmath93 by any element of @xmath94 and using the relations of @xmath94 , one can not decrease the length of @xmath93 in the word metric ( for the definition of word metric , see  @xcite ) .",
    "so , for each @xmath59 , we have an embedded incompressible genus two surface @xmath95 . by  @xcite ,",
    "there are immersed least - area ( minimal ) genus two surfaces @xmath96 with @xmath97 so that @xmath98 and @xmath99 induce the same mapping from @xmath100 to @xmath94 for each @xmath59 .",
    "since the @xmath99 are embedded ,  @xcite implies that the @xmath98 are embedded .",
    "we claim that the areas of the @xmath98 s are unbounded .",
    "assume not .",
    "then , there exists a constant @xmath57 such that area@xmath101 for all @xmath59 .",
    "the @xmath98 are stable since they are area - minimizing .",

    "since the @xmath98 are all without boundary , we get a uniform curvature estimate on all of @xmath98 , instead of just on balls . therefore , by lemma 1 , a subsequence of @xmath106 converges to a compact , connected , embedded minimal surface without boundary @xmath107 of finite multiplicity .    for large @xmath59 ,",
    "the @xmath98 are coverings of @xmath108 by the maximum principle , and the degree of the covering is proportional to @xmath59 .",
