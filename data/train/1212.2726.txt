    "the higgs mechanism in the standard model and the chiral symmetry breaking in qcd have the same structure ; the nature has broken the electroweak symmetry twice in the same way .",
    "this situation motivates us to consider a possibility that the uv physics of qcd is operating as the dynamics for the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "an example of such a scenario has been proposed in refs .",

    "if the standard model is defined in a compactified higher dimensional space - time , the qcd interaction gets strongly coupled at high energy and causes condensations of fermion pairs such as @xmath1 , breaking the electroweak symmetry .",
    "the low energy effective theory looks like the standard model where the higgs boson is an emergent particle .",
    "this scenario relies on strong gauge interactions in higher dimensional theories .",
    "however , it is this strong coupling that requires a uv cut - off to define a higher dimensional gauge theory . as in the nambu  jona - lasinio model @xcite for the chiral symmetry breaking , whether or not a condensation forms depends crucially on how the theory is cut - off , and thus discussion requires a uv completion of the theory .    a uv complete definition of a higher dimensional gauge theory may , in fact , be provided within four dimensional field theories by using the deconstruction technique  @xcite and supersymmetry ( susy ) .",

    "what is interesting is that , at this scale , it starts to appear a tower of magnetic gauge fields which can be seen from the s - duality in four dimensional supersymmetric theories .",
    "the tower represents the kk modes of a 6th dimension , and thus one can identify @xmath9 . thanks to the finiteness of the theory , we do not need to cut - off the theory at this scale even though the theory gets strongly coupled .",

    "the theory with a finite @xmath10 provides the low energy effective theory of the ( 2,0 ) theory , that approximates the @xmath2 limit up to a scale @xmath11 . for @xmath12 , gauge coupling constants are strong at every site , and thus one should include magnetic degrees of freedom in the effective theory .",
    "what is important here is that , in principle , the deconstructed theory enables us to discuss physics beyond the scale @xmath13 by dealing with strongly coupled four dimensional theories .",
    "armed with the confidence that a higher dimensional gauge theory exists and the strong coupling simply implies the appearance of magnetic degrees of freedom , one can now consider a possibility that the higgs field in the standard model is one of such emergent degrees of freedom . in this paper , based on the deconstructed ( 2,0 ) theory , we propose a two - site standard model as an effective theory of a higher dimensional standard model where the fundamental higgs fields are absent .",
    "if one of the two qcd couplings is large , one can find that the higgs fields appear as magnetic degrees of freedom .",

    "we will see that the higgs boson and the top / bottom quarks obtain correct masses .",

    "our prediction is close to this bound . unlike the models based on the susy desert , we do not expect a large logarithmic enhancement in the quantum corrections of the susy breaking terms . in that case ,",
    "the gauginos and other squarks ( including the right - handed sbottom ) can be as heavy as 2  tev while maintaining naturalness of the electroweak symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "such a spectrum is obtained in a scenario where susy is broken somewhere away from the 1st site .",
    "at this stage , the quarks in the first two generations and leptons are massless .",
    "a possible way to couple the fermions to the higgs fields is to let them propagate into the extra dimension and write down superpotential terms such as @xmath157 at the 1st site , where @xmath73 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 are quark and lepton superfields .",

    "not only for a theory definition , susy explains why the higgs boson is so light .",
    "however , in our discussion , a light higgs boson is obtained by a small coupling constant rather than a low susy breaking scale . from the bottom up",
    "point of view , the point is the presence of a uv completion in which the higgs operators do not have a potential at tree level , and couple to some tev dynamics with the strength of @xmath192 rather than unity .",
    "we are not aware of , but there can be such examples of non - supersymmetric models .    whether or not the higgs fields are fundamental is probably not a physical question .",
    "once we have a theory , they are just effective degrees of freedom wherever they come from .",
    "an important message from this study is that a trial to define a higher dimensional theory leads us to a picture of emergent higgs fields .",
