    "a simple generic optical sensor may be envisaged as porous material ( labelled @xmath3 , say ) , which is infiltrated by a fluid ( labelled @xmath4 , say ) .",
    "an agent to be sensed is contained within the fluid .",
    "it assumed that the fluid and the agent to be sensed have quite different optical properties .",
    "thus , the concentration of the agent within the fluid may be gauged by the optical properties of the infiltrated porous material tefano , pinet , sipe_oe .",
    "the optical properties used to detect the presence of the agent may be the reflectances or transmittances of the infiltrated porous material . alternatively ,",
    "if one surface of the porous material were coated with a thin metallic film , measurements could be based on the excitation of surface - plasmon - polariton ( spp ) waves at the interface of the porous material and metal film omola2003,azl2,scarano .",
    "for example , sculptured thin films ( stfs ) represent rather promising porous materials for such optical sensors lmbr , lgas , l_optik . these constitute parallel arrays of nanowires which are grown on substrates by physical vapour deposition tf_book , messier . by controlled manipulation of the substrate during the deposition process",
    ", a range of nanowire shapes can be achieved .",
    "thereby , the multiscale porosity of such stfs can be tailored to order , to a considerable degree .",
    "additionally , since stfs can fabricated from a wide range of organic and inorganic materials , a wide range of optical properties for the porous material can be delivered polo , horn .",
    "chiral stfs are especially interesting for optical sensing applications , as these support the circular bragg phenomenon , courtesy of the helical nature of their nanowires tf_book ; furthermore , they also support more than one mode of spp wave polo_prsa , dpl , pml_josab which may be usefully exploited for sensing ml_ieee_sj .    in the design of such an optical sensor",
    ", what values should one choose for the optical properties of the porous material and infiltrating fluid , in order to maximize sensitivity ?",
    "what value should one choose for the porosity , and what shape should one choose for the pores , in order to maximize sensitivity ?",
    "these are the questions that we address here .",
    "we do so by considering the simplest scenario wherein the porous material and infiltrating fluid are both made from lossless , homogeneous , isotropic dielectric materials , characterized by relative permittivities @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the infiltrated porous material is regarded as a homogeneous composite material ( hcm ) , which is a reasonable approximation provided that the linear dimensions of the pores are much smaller than the wavelength(s ) involved .",
    "thus , in the case of optical sensors operating at visible wavelengths , we have in mind pore linear dimensions @xmath5 nm for the smallest values of @xmath6 considered and @xmath7 nm for the largest values of @xmath6 considered .",
    "the infiltrated porous material may be either isotropic or anisotropic depending upon the shape of the pores .",
    "we use the well - established bruggeman homogenization formalism to estimate the relative permittivity dyadic of the infiltrated porous material , namely @xmath8 ward , m_jnp .",
    "the bruggeman formalism has recently been implemented to study the prospects of infiltrated stfs as optical sensors ml_inverse_homog , based on both changes in reflectance / transmittance ml_ieeepj and spp wave excitation ml_ieee_sj , ml_pnfa .    regardless of whether the sensor is based on changes in reflectance / transmittance or the excitation of spp waves , the sensitivity of the sensor depends crucially on how much the optical properties of the infiltrated porous material change in response to changes in the optical properties of the infiltrating fluid .",
    "thus , the derivative @xmath9 is a key indicator of sensitivity . in the following we",
    "explore how this derivative varies as a function of the porosity , the pore shape and the relative permittivities of the infiltrating fluid and the porous material .",
    "within our homogenization framework , the pores are all assumed to have the same shape , which is spheroidal in general . these spheroidal pores are randomly distributed but identically oriented .",
    "the surface of each spheroid relative to its centroid is prescribed by the vector m_jnp @xmath10 with @xmath11 being the radial unit vector originating from the spheroid s centroid , specified by the spherical polar coordinates @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the linear dimensions of the spheroid , as determined by the parameter @xmath14 , are assumed to be small relative to the electromagnetic wavelength(s ) .",
    "the spheroidal shape is captured by the dyadic @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the identity 3@xmath173 dyadic and the unit vector @xmath18 is parallel to the spheroid s axis of rotational symmetry .",
    "the linear dimension parallel to @xmath18 , relative to the equatorial radius of the spheroid , is provided by the shape parameter @xmath19 .",
    "a schematic illustration of such a spheroidal pore is provided in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the form of the relative permittivity dyadic @xmath20 , as estimated using the bruggeman homogenization formalism , mirrors that of the shape dyadic @xmath21 .",
    "that is , it has the uniaxial form @xmath22 it emerges as the solution of the dyadic bruggeman equation wlm @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the null 3@xmath173 dyadic .",
    "the scalars @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the respective volume fractions of the porous material and infiltrating fluid .",
    "thus , @xmath27 represents the porosity of the optical sensor .",
    "the dyadics @xmath28 are the polarizability density dyadics of the spheroids in the hcm , while the depolarization dyadic @xmath29 in eqn .",
    "is given by the double integral m97,mw97 @xmath30 it may be expressed in the uniaxial form @xmath31 with components @xmath32 wherein the terms @xmath33 are functions of the scalar parameter @xmath34 the double integrals on the right sides of eqns .   and may be evaluated as @xmath35 notice that the anomalous case @xmath36 which represents a hyperbolic hcm mld2005 is excluded from our consideration .",
    "the dyadic bruggeman equation yields the two nonlinear scalar equations @xmath37 which are coupled via @xmath38 . using standard numerical techniques ,",
    "this pair can be solved for @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "let us turn to the dyadic derivative which provides a measure of the sensitivity of the porous optical sensor under consideration , namely @xmath41 before proceeding further , we observe that the corresponding derivatives of the depolarization dyadic components may be expressed as @xmath42 with the scalars @xmath43 and derivatives @xmath44 next we exploit the scalar bruggeman equations and .",
    "their derivatives with respect to @xmath1 may be written as @xmath45 with @xmath46 thus , the sought after derivatives of @xmath40 and @xmath39 finally emerge as @xmath47",
    "num_inv    the consequences of the theory presented in the previous section are illustrated here by means of some numerical examples .",
    "we begin with the simplest case in  [ section_sphere ] wherein the pores are spherical and the infiltrated porous material is accordingly considered to be an isotropic hcm . then the effects of anisotropy are considered in  [ section_spheroid ] wherein the pores are taken to be spheroidal in shape .",
    "for the purposes of these numerical calculations , our attention is restricted to relative permittivity values which , at optical frequencies , are attainable either using naturally - occurring materials or currently - available engineered materials . in  [ closing ] the results of implementing relative permittivity values which lie beyond the reach of present - day technology are commented upon .",
    "section_sphere    if the pores are spherical ( i.e. , @xmath48 ) then the relative permittivity dyadic characterizing the infiltrated porous material reduces the the scalar form @xmath49 with @xmath50 . for @xmath51 , the bruggeman estimate @xmath52 and its derivative @xmath53",
    "are plotted versus @xmath54 and @xmath55 in fig .",
    "we see that when @xmath56 , the bruggeman estimate @xmath52 varies approximately linearly with @xmath1 for all @xmath57 .",
    "however , the relationship between @xmath52 and @xmath1 becomes increasingly nonlinear as @xmath0 increases . for @xmath58 , the derivative @xmath53 increases in an approximately linear fashion as the porosity @xmath27 increases , regardless of the value of @xmath1 .",
    "however , for @xmath59 the trend is rather different : here the values of @xmath60 peak at @xmath61 and the height of this peak rises as @xmath1 decreases .",
    "this peak in the value of @xmath60 becomes more pronounced as the value of @xmath0 increases .",
    "indeed , at @xmath62 this peak can be clearly observed even when @xmath63 .",
    "section_spheroid    let us now explore what happens when the pores are taken to be spheroidal .",
    "accordingly , the hcm representing the infiltrated porous material is a uniaxial dielectric material .",
    "following our findings in  [ section_sphere ] , we fix @xmath62 in order that the effects of pore shape are more clearly appreciated",
    ". the bruggeman estimates @xmath64 and their derivatives @xmath65 are plotted versus @xmath66 and @xmath55 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for @xmath67 .",
    "both @xmath40 and @xmath39 vary relatively little as @xmath1 increases but both decrease    @xmath39 approximately linearly and @xmath40 more nonlinearly    as @xmath27 increases .",
    "the derivative @xmath68 increases approximately uniformly as @xmath27 increases , for @xmath69 .",
    "however , the values of @xmath68 for @xmath70 are slightly peaked around @xmath71 . the plot of @xmath72 is similarly peaked , but in this case the peak occurs at @xmath73 , it is larger in height than the @xmath74 peak , and it extends further into the @xmath75 region . also , the height of this @xmath76 peak is substantially larger than the corresponding peak in @xmath53 observed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for @xmath62 .",
    "the pores represented in fig .  [ fig2 ] are prolate spheroids .",
    "the corresponding case of oblate spheroids is represented in fig .",

    "[ fig3 ] and @xmath39 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . also , the plots of the derivatives @xmath74 and @xmath78 versus @xmath1 and @xmath27 in fig .  [ fig3 ] are similar to the corresponding plots of @xmath76 and @xmath68 , respectively , in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , albeit there are qualitative differences in the positions and shapes of the peaks in the derivative plots .",
    "closing    an analysis based on the bruggeman homogenization formalism has provided insights into the sensitivity of a generic porous optical sensor . specifically , for a porous material of relative permittivity @xmath0 infiltrated by a fluid of relative permittivity @xmath1 , we found that :    * the sensitivity is maximized when there is a large contrast between @xmath0 and @xmath1 ; * if the contrast between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is large , maximum sensitivity is achieved at mid - range values of porosity ; * higher sensitivities may be achieved for @xmath79 close to unity when @xmath80 , for example ; and * higher sensitivities may be achieved by incorporating elongated pores .    in  [ num_inv ] the relative permittivities of the porous material considered were @xmath81 .",
    "these values correspond to many common dielectric materials at optical frequencies , with the largest value being close to the relative permittivity of silicon , for example .",
    "the relative permittivities of the infiltrating fluid were taken to be in the range @xmath82 .",
    "this range is physically - realizable , with the largest values corresponding to nanocomposite fluids developed for immersion lithography langmuir whereas values approaching unity may be attained using water vapour team , for examples .",
    "we note that ongoing rapid developments in engineered materials are bringing relative permittivity parameter regimes , which were hitherto unattainable , into reach imovski , lederer .",
    "for example , relative permittivities in excess of 50 are now being reported for engineered materials in the terahertz frequency regime hin_prl , nature_high_n , while engineered materials with positive - valued relative permittivities less than unity also appear to be attainable alu , lovat , cia_prb .",
    "accordingly , it is of interest to consider how the sensitivities reported here would be effected if rather more exotic parameter regimes were incorporated . in further numerical studies ( not presented in  [ num_inv ] ) it was observed that increasing @xmath0 beyond 15 results in a steady increase in sensitivity . reducing the value of @xmath1 from unity results in a sharp increase in sensitivity . in this context",
    "let us make a couple of parenthetical remarks : first , since the entire analysis presented herein is isomorphic to the corresponding scenario for magnetic materials ( with relative permittivities replaced by relative permeabilities throughout ) , we note that relative permeabilities less than unity can be achieved by using diamagnetic materials ook .",
    "second , the regime @xmath83 with @xmath84 ( or vice versa ) gives rise to bruggeman estimates of the hcm relative permittivity dyadic which are not physically plausible ag and therefore this regime is avoided here .",
    "the design parameters considered here were the relative permittivities of the porous material and the infiltrating fluid , along with the porosity and the shapes of the pores . in the operation of such a generic optical sensor",
    "  at least in the most straightforward mode of operation    it may be envisaged that the relative permittivity of the infiltrating fluid is a variable quantity ( which varies according to concentration of the agent to be sensed ) whereas the other design parameters remain fixed . accordingly , the value of the relative permittivity of the fluid should be carefully chosen such that the sensitivity is maximized over the expected range of concentrations of the agent to be sensed .    while our attention here has been confined to infiltrated porous materials represented as uniaxial dielectric hcms , a straightforward extension of the presented analysis could accommodate biaxial dielectric hcms which represent certain stfs as optical sensors ml_ieee_sj , ml_ieeepj , ml_pnfa .    finally , the study described herein provides a step towards a comprehensive study of porous platforms for optical sensing , which incorporates such matters as the absorption / desorption phenomenons that dictate the response time and the reversibility of the sensors .      l. de stefano , l. rotiroti , e. de tommasi , i. rea , i. rendina , m. canciello , g. maglio , and r. palumbo , ",
