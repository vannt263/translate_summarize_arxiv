    "driven by the interests in both basic research and technological application , the electronic structures of two - dimensional quantum dots ( qds ) have been a topic extensively studied in recent years .",
    "the particle number in qds can be reduced precisely down to a few electrons with highly controllable confinements , interactions and external fields .",
    "the specific spin states of electrons and their manipulations by magnetic and electric fields have been proposed for basic qubit schemes@xcite for future quantum computation .",
    "therefore , it is important to understand the quantum behaviors of few - electron qds .",
    "theoretically , the system with appropriate magnetic fields may be viewed as a finite - size precursor of integer and fractional quantum hall states in two - dimensional electron gas ( 2degs ) which can be understood by the laughlin wave functions@xcite and composite fermion theory.@xcite in the ordinary fractional hall system , the short - range interactions between particles are important . however , in few - electron qds , long - range interactions are important due to the low charge density , and make the characters of confined electrons different from those of extent system with larger charge density . in magnetic fields , it has been demonstrated that there are the transitions from liquid states to rotating wigner molecular ( rwm ) states@xcite in qds .",
    "similar liquid - crystal transitions are also expected for 2degs but in very strong fields.@xcite    both the fractional quantum hall states and the electronic states in qds are strongly correlated . here ,",
    "the correlations mean not only the classic but also the quantum ones , i.e. the entanglements between electrons .",
    "the essential role of the quantum correlation in fractional quantum hall system has been widely discussed .",
    "however , the investigations of the entanglements in few - electron qds are still limited .    when discussing qds in strong magnetic fields , the ground states can be often taken as full polarized due to the zeeman splitting",
    ". with improving nanotechnology , it is achieved to fabricate the qds with negligible zeeman splitting in recent experiments.@xcite then the electrons of the ground states in strong magnetic fields may not be full polarized . with the spin degree of freedom , although the liquid - crystal transitions still exist , both the characters of energy level structure and correlations between electrons are different from the full polarized systems . in this work , based on exact diagonalization ( ed ) method , we explore the correlations and entanglements in the qds with spin degree of freedom and discuss their behaviors in the liquid - crystal transition .",
    "the halmiltonian of a n - electron qd in a perpendicular magnetic field without the zeeman splitting is written as @xmath0}\\!\\!+\\!\\!\\sum_{i < j}{\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\varepsilon|\\vec{r}_i-\\vec{r}_j|}}.\\ ] ] the first and second parts of eq.([eq01 ] ) are respectively the single - particle energies and interaction energies of the electrons .",
    "@xmath1 is the vector potential of the magnetic field . @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the effective mass and static dielectric constant which are respectively 0.067@xmath4 and 12.4 for gaas .",
    "@xmath5 is the confinement of the dot .",
    "we use the method of series expansion@xcite to get exact eigenstates @xmath6 of the single - particles parts of eq.([eq01 ] ) as a set of single - particle bases . then in the second quantization scheme the hamiltonian([eq01 ] ) can be written as @xmath7 with @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of the single - particle state @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is its energy .",
    "then eq.([eq02 ] ) is diagonalized to obtain the energies and the corresponding wave functions @xmath12 of the few - electron states . in the following discussions ,",
    "the confinement of the dot is parabolic and the strength is 2 mev .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that the series expansion method is applicable not only to the parabolic confinement , but also other confinement forms for which analytic single - particle bases can not be obtained . without spin - orbit coupling , the few - electron states can be the common eigenstates of total angular momentum @xmath13 , total spin @xmath14 and its z - component @xmath15 . in the paper",
    ", we will mark the lowest states with different spins as ( @xmath13,@xmath14,@xmath15 ) for brevity .",
    "of course , the states with same @xmath13 and @xmath14 but different @xmath15 are degenerate due to the absence of the zeeman splitting .",
    "having got the eigenstates of eq.([eq02 ] ) , we can evaluate the charge and spin correlations by the conditional probability densities ( cpds ) @xmath16 and @xmath17    in this paper , we also investigate the behaviors of entanglements of the few - electron electronic states .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the von neumann entropy@xcite @xmath18 $ ] can be used for quantifying the entanglements between particles .",
    "@xmath19 is the single - particle reduced density matrix .",
    "although in multiparticle case it is not convinced how to quantify all the entanglement properties of an identical - particle state , the von neumann entropy can still give the entanglement information between one particle and the other part of the system . in the following discussions , we employ a modified form of the von neumann entropy as@xcite @xmath20-\\ln n\\ ] ] with @xmath21 where n is the particle number of the system . with such modification , the entropy due to the indistinguishability of the particles is subtracted . and the lower limit values of entropies for the system with different particle number are all equal to zero , which corresponds to the unentangled states .",
    "( color online ) energy spectra of the four- ( a ) and five - electron ( b ) states as functions of the magnetic field .",
    "n times of the energy of the first landau level have been subtracted from the total energy .",
    "black , red and green lines correspond to the four- ( five- ) electron states with s=0 ( 0.5 ) , 1 ( 1.5 ) and 2 ( 2.5 ) , respectively .",
    "the states correspond to the filling factors @xmath22 , 1/3 and 1/5 have been indicated.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the energy spectra of four- and five - electron qds in magnetic fields are shown in fig.[fig : energyspectrum ] . for clarity ,",
    "n times of the energy of the first landau level have been subtracted from the total energy . in smaller fields ,",
    "the states with different spins are clearly separated .",
    "the full - polarized ground state corresponding to filling factor @xmath22 , namely the maximum density droplet ( mdd)@xcite , has lower energy in a long range of magnetic field . without the zeeman splitting ,",
    "the states with lower spin can become the ground states even in strong magnetic fields .",
    "the ground states in the magnetic fields corresponding to fractional filling factors ( 1/3 , 1/5 , etc . ) are still full - polarized . in the magnetic fields where the flux deviates from the values of fractional filling factors by @xmath23 ( @xmath24 is the quantum of magnetic flux )",
    "the ground states will be the ones with lowest total spin .",
    "such situation is same as that in 2degs with spin degree of freedom . in strong fields ,",
    "the electrons form the rwms . with the decreased overlapping of electrons ,",
    "the exchange energies of different spin states are depressed totally .",
    "then the states with different total spins are almost degenerate and form a narrow band .        with the increase of the field ,",
    "there are angular momentum transitions for the ground states .",
    "the allowable angular momenta are so called magic numbers.@xcite with the zeeman splitting , the angular momentum transition of the four- and five - electron ground states in magnetic fields has the period as the particle number n. including the spin degree of freedom , the angular momentum transition of ground states with the increase of the field is almost continuous . however , for the lowest states with different total spins , the angular momentum transitions indeed have some rules . in strong magnetic fields where",
    "the electron are well localized , such rules can be obtained from the theory of electron molecules.@xcite for example , the lowest four - electron states with @xmath25 must be the ones with angular momenta @xmath26 or @xmath27 , the lowest states with @xmath28 must be the ones with @xmath26 or @xmath29 . for five electrons",
    ", it can be obtained from our studies that the angular momenta of lowest states with @xmath30 can be the continuous integers , the lowest states with @xmath31 must be the ones with @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is an integer . in both cases ,",
    "the transitions for full - polarized states still have a period of particle number n.    in small magnetic fields where the electronic states are still liquid - like ones , the transition rules of angular momenta described above are not exact .",
    "the states with some angular momenta coincide with the rules do not appear as the lowest states .",
    "for example , for the five - electron case with @xmath30 , the angular momenta can be arbitrary integers in strong fields , but the states with @xmath34 do not appear as the lowest states . examining the results obtained by exact diagonalization carefully , it can be found that such deletion for four- ( five- ) electron states disappears when the filling factor @xmath35 .",
    "the different angular momentum transition patterns just reflect the transition of the electronic states from the liquid to crystal ones with the increase of the field .",
    "we also illustrate the angular momentum transition pattern for the lowest states with different spins in fig.[fig : magneticcoupling ] . it can be seen in both fig.[fig : energyspectrum ] and fig.[fig : magneticcoupling ] that the angular momentum transitions become regular in strong fields , as discussed above .      within the liquid - crystal transition , the correlations between electrons of the lowest states change from the short - range liquid to long - range crystal ones .",
    "in the third row of fig.[fig : pcf ] , we show some examples of the two kinds of correlations .",
    "it can be seen in the plot that the cpds of the four - electron state ( -4,0,0 ) and five - electron state ( -8,0.5,0.5 ) are liquid - like . in strong magnetic fields , the states with larger angular momenta exhibit crystal - like correlations , which are the characters of the rwms .    besides the angular momentum and charge correlation transitions , there are also different spin correlations .",
    "we inspect the spin correlations by examining the spin cpds to find electrons with a certain spin when a spin - up electron is fixed .",
    "we found that the spin correlations can reveal the magnetic couplings between electrons in non- and partial - polarized states with minimum @xmath15 .",
    "we illustrate some spin cpds in the first two rows of fig.[fig : pcf ] . it can be seen that when a spin - up electron is fixed at the position indicated by the white dot , the spin - up and spin - down electrons in the state ( -16,0,0 ) will be probably at the neighbor and opposite positions , respectively .",
    "such cpds just reveal the existence of ferromagnetic couplings between electrons . for the state ( -16,1,0 ) , the cpds shown in the figure are just contrary to that for ( -16,0,0 ) and reveal the anti - ferromagnetic couplings .",
    "for the five - electron state ( -35,0.5,0.5 ) , the spin cpds show that neither the spin - up nor the spin - down electrons have preferable positions when a spin - up electron is fixed",
    ". then we can not expect any specific magnetic coupling for it .",
    "we have found that other states also exhibit respective couplings even if the angular momenta are so small that the states are still liquid ones .",
    "as shown in fig.[fig : pcf ] , the cpds for the state ( -4,0,0 ) and ( -8,0.5,0.5 ) also reveal the ferromagnetic couplings between electrons .",
    "although the electrons are no longer well localized , the spin - up electrons are closer to the fixed electron than the spin - down ones .    it should be pointed out that , strictly speaking , the four - electron states can perform the ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic couplings . for five - electron states , only ferrimagnetic coupling along with",
    "the ferromagnetic coupling exist because of the unequal electron numbers with two species of spins .",
    "one example of cpds showing the ferrimagnetic coupling are presented in the inset of fig.[fig : magneticcoupling](b ) . and",
    "full - polarized states can not exhibit any specific magnetic coupling .",
    "( color online ) angular momentum transitions of four - electron ( a ) and five - electron ( b ) states as functions of magnetic fields .",
    "black , red and green lines correspond to the states with @xmath36 and 2 for four electrons and 0.5 , 1.5 and 2.5 for five electrons .",
    "the positions correspond to the filling factor @xmath22 , 1/3 and 1/5 have been indicated .",
    "the magnetic coupling oscillations of the non- and partial - polarized states with minimum @xmath15 as function of magnetic field and angular momentum are shown in the bottom and right panels , respectively .",
    "insets : the spin cpds of the states ( -14,0,0 ) and ( -36,0.5,0.5 ) for spin - down and -up electrons and the charge cpds are shown from left - upper to right - bottom corner.,scaledwidth=43.0% ]    in the previous discussions , we have shown that the spin cpds can reveal the magnetic couplings in the lowest states with different spins although the correlations are quite different for the liquid and crystal ones",
    ". then we can identify the specific coupling for each state .",
    "the magnetic couplings as functions of magnetic fields i.e. angular momenta are shown in the bottom and right panels of fig.[fig : magneticcoupling ] .",
    "the values @xmath37 correspond to the anti - ferromagnetic ( ferrimagnetic ) , ferromagnetic and no specific coupling , respectively . for the states with different angular momenta , the couplings are different . and",
    "it is interesting to observe various magnetic coupling oscillation patterns for the states with different total spins .",
    "again , all oscillations become regular with respect to the magnetic field , i.e. angular momentum when the field is strong enough to form the rwms . in strong fields , the four - electron states with @xmath25 and @xmath38 are ferromagnetic",
    "( anti - ferromagnetic).@xcite the states with @xmath28 and @xmath39 are anti - ferromagnetic ( ferromagnetic ) , where @xmath33 is an arbitrary integer .",
    "the five - electron states also have their own magnetic coupling rules as shown in fig.[fig : magneticcoupling ] .",
    "the states with @xmath30 and @xmath40 are ferrimagnetic ( ferromagnetic ) .",
    "the couplings for the states with @xmath31 are just contrary to that with @xmath30 . in any case",
    ", the oscillation with respect to the momenta performs a period of particle number @xmath41 .",
    "a special feature of the five - electron case is that the states with @xmath30 and @xmath42 have no specific magnetic coupling , as the example ( -35,0.5,0.5 ) in fig.[fig : pcf ] .",
    "such systematic vanish of the magnetic coupling is absent in the four - electron case .    in small fields , the oscillations are no longer regular .",
    "this is because that the angular momentum transition pattern in small fields is different from that in strong fields .",
    "the vanishing states with some angular momenta cause the irregularity of the oscillation .",
    "( color online ) entanglement entropies of the lowest states of four ( a ) and five ( b ) electrons with different spins .",
    "a term @xmath43 has been subtracted .",
    "@xmath44 , @xmath45 and correspond to the states with non- , partial to full - polarized spins , respectively.,scaledwidth=38.0% ]    in this subsection , we investigate the features of entanglements in the liquid - crystal transition .",
    "the von neumann entropy@xcite is used for the quantification of the extent of the entanglement . according to eq.([entform ] ) , the entanglement entropies of different spin states as functions of the magnetic field are given in fig.[fig : entanglement ] .",
    "a feature of the entanglements in qd is that the entropies of the states with same @xmath13 and @xmath14 but different @xmath15 are unequal although their energies are same when the zeeman splitting is ignored .",
    "the differences corresponding to different @xmath15 are approximately constant in strong magnetic fields . especially for a state with maximum @xmath15 where the entropy owing to the spin components is totally eliminated",
    ", its entropy should differ from that of the state with minimum @xmath15 by one , which is revealed by our calculation . without the zeeman splitting ,",
    "the energies of the states with same @xmath13 but different @xmath14 in strong magnetic fields are nearly degenerate . in fig.[fig : entanglement ] , the entropies of such states with same @xmath15 also converge and increase monotonously .",
    "such convergence of the entanglements is also a character of rwms .    for the liquid states in lower magnetic fields where the interaction energies vary in different spin states , the variations of entanglements are not monotonous any more .",
    "the states with different @xmath14 have their own minimal values in respective fields . the state corresponding to the mdd with maximum @xmath15 has the global minimum entanglement entropy , i.e. the minimum correlation . in 2degs ,",
    "the laughlin wave function with filling factor @xmath22 is unentangled.@xcite similarly , in few - electron qds , the entanglement entropies of the mdd states are also very close to zero .",
    "to conclude , we have investigated the liquid - crystal transitions in the few - electron quantum dot without the zeeman splitting .",
    "the spin degree of freedom brings various characters to the transition .",
    "the energy level structures in the range of liquid and crystal phase are quite different . in strong magnetic fields , different spin states with specific angular momentum transition rules form a narrow band which is the character of the rotating wigner molecular states . in small fields ,",
    "such rules are no longer strictly obeyed by the liquid - like states . for both the liquid- and crystal - like states with the lowest @xmath15",
    ", there are magnetic couplings between electrons although the spin cpds are quite different .",

    "the entanglement entropies which do not depend on the total spins of the states increase monotonously .",
    "the entropy differences due to the different @xmath15 are approximately constant . in the liquid states ,",
    "the oscillations of the magnetic couplings are irregular and the variations of the entanglements are not monotonous .",
