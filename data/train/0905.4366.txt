    "metal abundances in the hot x - ray emitting interstellar medium ( ism ) are important for understanding the star formation history and evolution of galaxies . a large fraction of metals in the ism are synthesized by type ia and type ii supernovae ( sne ia / ii ) . o and mg",
    "are predominantly synthesized by sne ii , while fe is mainly produced by sne ia .",
    "therefore , the abundance ratios provide useful information on the contribution of both types of sne enriching the metals .    compared to starburst galaxies , normal spiral galaxies have lower star formation rates ( sfrs ) , and have lower x - ray surface brightness , because the integrated soft x - ray luminosities of spiral galaxies correlate with sfr @xcite .",
    "in addition , these galaxies sometimes exhibit strong x - ray emission from the central active galactic nuclei . as a result",
    ", it has remained rather difficult to constrain the abundances of their hot ism over a wide range of species from o to fe .    in order to determine the metal abundances of o ,",
    "ne , s , and ar from the emission lines in h regions , several optical observations have been performed ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) . in particular , o emission lines , a good tracer of sne ii , are the brightest in the optical band . however , determination of the metal abundances , including o , has large uncertainty due to dust grains , the composition of which is difficult to ascertain . in addition , no significant fe lines , a good tracer of sn ia , exist in the optical band .",
    "the einstein satellite first observed the thermal x - ray emission from spiral galaxies @xcite , and rosat and asca subsequently measured the temperature and fe ism abundances @xcite .",
    "chandra and xmm - newton have enabled us to study the spatial distribution of metals by utilizing their large effective area and high angular resolution @xcite . however , the o and mg abundance measurements are difficult due to the intrinsic instrumental background and asymmetric energy response in the low energy band below @xmath2 kev . because suzaku xis @xcite has higher spectral sensitivity below @xmath2 kev , and a lower and more stable background level compared to chandra acis and xmm - newton epic ,",
    "the accuracy of the determination of o and mg abundances is improved .",
    "recent suzaku observations have revealed the abundance profiles of the ism in x - ray bright elliptical and starburst galaxies in detail @xcite .",
    "( , ) figure1.eps    ngc 4258 ( m 106 ) is a nearby sabbc spiral galaxy with a high inclination angle of 72@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "its distance is accurately measured to be 7.2 mpc @xcite , where 1@xmath4 corresponds to 2.1 kpc . @xcite",
    "first discovered the obscured low - luminosity active galactic nucleus ( llagn ) in ngc 4258 with asca , and also showed that its 110 kev spectrum is composed of contributions from thermal plasmas , integrated low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , and the nucleus .",
    "a rosat observation detected two thermal components with @xmath5 and @xmath6 kev in the ism @xcite , which were confirmed with chandra and xmm - newton observations @xcite .",
    "the 210 kev flux from the nucleus was reported to vary on time scales of hours to years @xcite .",
    "a recent suzaku observation has revealed that the circum - nuclear matter forms a slim obscuring structure with solid angle much smaller than typical thick tori @xcite .",
    "the galaxy has a curious jet - like feature , what is called an `` anomalous arms '' , emitting soft x - rays ( e.g. , @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the hot spots associated with the galactic radio jet have been detected at a distance of around 1@xmath4 from the nucleus in x - rays by chandra @xcite . aside from these anomalous arms , which seem to be related to the nuclear activity , ngc 4258",
    "can be regarded as being similar to our galaxy in terms of the low activity of the central black hole .",
    "the fact that the emission from the nucleus is deeply absorbed with a thick circum - nuclear matter @xcite is helpful to study the thermal emission . in this paper , we report the detailed analysis of ngc 4258 with suzaku , focusing on the thermal emission of the ism to constrain the metal abundances .    unless noted otherwise , the solar abundance table used is taken from given by @xcite , and the quoted errors are for a 90@xmath7 confidence interval for a single interesting parameter .",
    "suzaku carried out an observation of ngc 4258 in 2006 june .",
    "we analyzed only the xis data in this paper , although suzaku observed the object with both xis and hxd @xcite , centered on the hxd field of view , and the hxd results from this observation on the nucleus have already been published by @xcite .",
    "the xis consists of four sets of x - ray ccd camera system ( xis0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 ) .",
    "xis1 has a back - illuminated ( bi ) sensor , while xis0 , 2 , and 3 have front - illuminated ( fi ) sensors .",
    "the averaged pointing direction of the xis is centered on ( r.a . , dec.)= ( , ) .",
    "the xis was operated in the normal clocking mode ( 8 s exposure per frame ) , with the standard 5 @xmath8 5 and 3 @xmath8 3 editing mode .",
    "we processed the xis data by the `` xispi '' and `` makepi '' ftools task and the caldb files of 2008 - 01 - 31 version .",
    "then , the xis data were cleaned by assuming thresholds on the earth elevation angle of @xmath9 and the day - earth elevation angle of @xmath10 .",
    "we also discarded data during the time since the spacecraft exit from the south atlantic anomaly was unless than 436 sec .",
    "we created a light curve of each sensor over 0.5 - 2 kev binned 540 sec to exclude periods of an anomalous event rate greater or less than @xmath11 around the mean .",
    "after the above screening , the remaining good exposures were 99.9 and 99.8 ksec for fis and bi , respectively .",
    "event screening with cut - off rigidity was not performed .",
    "we also excluded the rawy@xmath12119 region on the xis2 and 3 due to an erroneous dark frame during this observation .",
    "the spectral analysis was performed with heasoft version 6.5 and xspec 12.4 . in order to subtract the non - x - ray background ( nxb ) , we employed the dark - earth database by the `` xisnxbgen '' ftools task @xcite .",
    "we generated two different ancillary response files ( arfs ) for the spectrum of each region , which assumed uniform sky emission and the observed xis1 image by the `` xissimarfgen '' ftools task @xcite .",
    "we also included the effect of contaminations on the optical blocking filters of the xis in the arfs .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results of these fits are shown in figure [ spec_gal ] , and the derived parameters are summarized in table [ par_gal ] .",
    "thus , several emission lines are seen around 0.50.6 kev , 0.60.7 kev , @xmath13 1.3 kev , and @xmath13 1.8 kev , and are identified with those of o , o , mg and si , respectively .",
    "furthermore , emission lines around 0.71 kev correspond to the fe - l complex , as well as to k - lines from ne and ne .",
    "the fits are not formally acceptable because of the big residuals around 2 kev owing to calibration issues of si edges , which are known to be present in all the xis ccds @xcite",
    ". however , these results are still useful to assess whether the temperatures and metal abundances in the ism were reasonably determined or not .",
    "the one - temperature model results in @xmath14 kev .",
    "the fit statistics shown in table [ par_gal ] clearly favor the two - temperature model , which gives the two temperatures as 0.23 and 0.59 kev , with corresponding 0.22.4 kev unabsorbed fluxes of 1.0@xmath15 and 2.5@xmath15 erg @xmath16 s@xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the 0.12.4 kev total unabsorbed ism luminosity is 2.2@xmath18 erg s@xmath17 , which is consistent with that of the previous xmm - newton results @xcite .",
    "the three - temperature model improved the fit statistics only slightly , and yielded the temperatures as 0.13 , 0.36 , and 0.62 kev .",
    "the implied abundance ratios did not change , as shown in table [ par_gal ] .    in order to examine abundance ratios rather than absolute values",
    ", we calculated confidence contours between the abundance of metals ( o , ne , mg and si ) and that of fe , using the two - temperature model for the ism . the results are shown in figure [ contour ] , where we also indicate 90%-confidence abundance of these metals relative to fe .      in order to investigate how these results are sensitive to the assumed galactic model , we let the temperatures of the mwh and lhb vary freely . although the temperatures of the galactic components became 0.17 and 0.61 kev , the ism abundance ratios were little affected .",
    "when we change the normalizations of galactic apec@xmath19 and apec@xmath20 by @xmath21% and @xmath22% , respectively , the metals to fe abundance ratios of the ism remained the same within @xmath23% .",
    "the systematic uncertainty due to the assumption of the obf contaminant is less than the statistical error in the ngc 4258 region .",
    "thus , the uncertainties in the background and the obf contaminant have little effect on the abundance ratios of the ngc 4258 ism .",
    "next , we investigate uncertainties in the absorption parameter . although we have carried out the fits with the absorption fixed to the galactic value , @xcite have shown that absorption varies by a factor of a few , depending on location .",
    "when we fit the spectra with the absorption allowed to vary freely , the resultant absorption is constrained with an upper limit of @xmath24 of @xmath25 @xmath16 .",
    "thus , we confirm that the effect of the absorption is almost negligible because the resultant abundance change insignificantly .    in order to examine the dependence on the lmxb component",
    ", we used power - law model instead of the bremss model in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the abundance ratios to fe did not change significantly either .",
    "the derived ne to fe abundance ratio is higher by a factor of @xmath26 higher than the solar abundance .",
    "this is presumably because the ne abundance is not reliably determined due to an overlap with the strong and complex fe - l line emissions .",
    "@xcite have detected the hot spots of the jet located around 1@xmath4 from the nucleus in x - rays , and also found a non - thermal component besides that from the agn within a region centered on the nucleus . in order to examine the contribution of the jet emission",
    ", we tried to investigate the spatial distribution of the metal abundances . because the above physical scales are much smaller than the nominal 3@xmath4 point spread function of suzaku @xcite , we are only able to place crude constraints .",
    "we first extracted spectra from two separate regions for comparison : ( i ) a circular aperture of radius 3@xmath4 centered on the nucleus , and ( ii ) the remainder of the elliptical data - accumulation region from figure [ image ] , excluding the central 3@xmath4 .",
    "we fitted the two spectra with the two - temperature model .",
    "unfortunately , poor photon statistics prevented the detection of any significant abundance differences between the two regions .",
    "thus we carried out a different test in which we added the following jet model from @xcite to the two - temperature model : phabs@xmath27power - law@xmath28 .",
    "here , phabs@xmath28 , the intrinsic absorption , was fixed at 3.4@xmath29 @xmath16 , and the photon index of power - law@xmath28 was fixed at 1.74 @xcite .",
    "then , the 0.52 kev jet emission flux was rather tightly constrained to be @xmath12 4.5@xmath30 erg @xmath16 s@xmath17 , at a confidence limit of 90% . because the other parameters , including the metal abundances , did not change significantly , we conclude that our results are not affected by the jet emission .",
    "( , ) figure3.eps    ( , ) figure4.eps",
    "the present suzaku observation has clearly revealed emission line features from the ism in the spiral galaxy ngc 4258 .",
    "we successfully measured the metal abundances of o , ne , mg , si and fe for the first time .",
    "previous observations with xmm - newton and chandra with better angular resolutions successfully measured spatial temperature variations and the geometric structure of `` anomalous arms '' .",
    "but , the metal abundances were not constrained due to insufficient photon statistics @xcite .",
    "figure [ ratio ] shows our metal - to - fe ratios , which were derived from the two - parameter confidence contours in figure [ contour ] .",
    "the ism emission is here modeled with two temperatures .    in figure",
    "[ ratio ] , the abundance pattern of ngc 4258 is compared with those indicated by the solar abundance table of @xcite and the new solar abundance table of @xcite . the o abundance in @xcite was derived from solar photospheric lines , considering three - dimentional hydrostatic model atmospheres and non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( asplund 2005 and references therein ) .",
    "thus , the abundance pattern of the ism of ngc 4258 measured with suzaku agrees better with that of @xcite , rather than that of @xcite .",
    "the calculated sn ii and sn ia yields are also plotted in figure [ ratio ] . here",
    ", the sn ii yields by @xcite refer to an average over the salpeter initial mass function of stellar masses from 10 to 50 @xmath31 , with a progenitor metallicity of @xmath32 . the sn ia yields were taken from the w7 model @xcite .",
    "the abundance pattern of the ism of ngc 4258 is located between those of sn ii and sn ia , and consistent with their mixture is .    in order to investigate differences between spiral and starburst galaxies , we also plot in figure [ ratio ] the abundance pattern of the hot ism in disk and halo regions of the starburst galaxy ngc 4631 @xcite , and that of the `` cap '' region of the extreme starburst galaxy m 82 @xcite .",
    "the results of ngc 4631 disk are consistent with those of @xcite as is the case of ngc 4258 , while the respective patterns of m 82 `` cap '' and the halo region of ngc 4631 are close to those expected from sn ii yields .",
    "the sfr of ngc 4258 derived from its far infrared luminosity is low , @xmath130.01 @xmath31 yr@xmath17 @xcite , compared with those of ngc 4631 and m 82 , which are 2.99 and 9.39 @xmath31 yr@xmath17 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the 0.52 kev luminosity of the lmxb component of ngc 4258 , 3.5 @xmath8 10@xmath33 erg s@xmath17 , is consistent with the mass vs. x - ray luminosity relation for spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus , we can regard ngc 4258 as a `` normal '' spiral galaxy .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that solar abundance pattern are common in normal spiral galaxies , including ngc 4258 and our galaxy .",
    "the fact that the disk region of ngc 4631 also has a similar abundance pattern to normal spirals , suggests that the metallicity of the ism after its starburst era may look quite similar .",
    "in contrast , in starburst galaxies , sn ii products such as o effectively escape into the halo region as a result of the energetic explosions .",
    "thus , observations of abundance patterns such as ours play a key role in investigating the processes of galaxy evolution and enrichment of the intergalactic medium .",
