    "[ sec : intro ]    following the detailed investigation of inclusive pion @xcite and baryon @xcite production in p+p interactions , the present paper concentrates on the study of charged kaons .",
    "it thus completes a series of publications aimed at the exploration of final state hadrons in p+p collisions by using a new set of high precision data from the na49 detector at the cern sps @xcite .",
    "the data have been obtained at a beam momentum of 158  gev / c corresponding to a center - of - mass system ( cms ) energy of 17.2  gev .",
    "this matches the highest momentum per nucleon obtainable with lead beams at the sps , permitting the direct comparison of elementary and nuclear reactions .",
    "in addition , the chosen cms energy marks , concerning kaon production , the transition from threshold - dominated effects with strong @xmath20-dependences to the more gentle approach to higher energies where scaling concepts become worth investigating . on the other hand",
    "the characteristic differences between k@xmath21 and k@xmath22 production which are directly related to the underlying production mechanisms , as for instance associate kaon+hyperon versus k+@xmath23 pair production , are still well developed at sps energy .",
    "they are manifest in the strong evolution of the k@xmath21/k@xmath22 ratio as a function of the kinematic variables .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is in addition the attempt to put the available results from other experiments into perspective with the present data in order to come to a quantitative evaluation of the experimental situation .",
    "a critical assessment of the complete @xmath20-dependence of kaon production seems the more indicated as its evolution in heavy ion interactions , especially in relation to pions , is promulgated since about two decades as a signature of `` new '' physics by the creation of a deconfined state of matter in these interactions .",
    "as all claims of this nature have to rely completely on a comparison with elementary collisions , the detailed study of the behaviour of kaon production in p+p reactions from threshold up to rhic and collider energies should be regarded as a necessity in particular as the last global evaluation of this type dates back by more than 30 years @xcite .",
    "a complete coverage of phase space , as far as a comparison of different experiments is concerned , is made possible in this paper , as compared to pions @xcite and baryons @xcite , by the fact that there is no concern about feed - down corrections from weak hyperon decays , with the exception of @xmath24 decay which is negligible for all practical purposes .",

    "if the phase space coverage of the existing data has been shown to be incomplete and partially incompatible for pion and baryon production in the preceding publications @xcite , the situation is even more unsatisfactory for charged kaons . a wide range of data covering essentially the complete energy range from kaon threshold via the ps and",

    "[ sec : pid ]    the identification of kaons by their ionization energy loss in the gas of the tpc detector system meets with specific problems if compared to pion @xcite and baryon @xcite selection .",
    "this specificity has several reasons :    * corresponding to the momentum range of the na49 data the ionization energy loss has to be determined in the region of the relativistic rise of the energy deposit , with the kaon energy loss positioned in between the one for baryons and for pions . *",
    "the relative distance in @xmath39 between the different particle species is small and varies from only 4.5 to 7% for kaons with respect to protons and from 6.5 to 14% with respect to pions , over the @xmath30 range of the present data , with an rms width of the energy loss distributions of typically 3% .",
    "this creates an appreciable overlap problem over most of the phase space investigated . *",
    "high precision in the determination of the absolute position of the mean truncated energy loss per particle species and of the corresponding widths is therefore mandatory . *",
    "the relative production yield of kaons is generally small as compared to pions , with k/@xmath25 ratios on the level of 530% for k@xmath21 and 520% for k@xmath22 .",
    "in addition , for k@xmath21 the fast decrease of the k@xmath21/p ratio from typically 1 at @xmath30  =  0 to less than 5% at @xmath30  =  0.4 finally imposes a limit on the applicability of @xmath39 identification towards high @xmath30 values .",

    "several aspects and results of this work , in particular as far as kaon identification is concerned , will be discussed in the following sub - sections .",
    "[ sec : dedx_shape ]    due to the small k/@xmath25 and k / p ratios mentioned above , the precise description of the tails of the energy loss distributions of the dominant particle species becomes important .",
    "the extraction of kaon yields becomes indeed sensitive to small deviations in the upper tail of the proton and in the lower tail of the pion distributions for the extreme yield ratios mentioned above , as is also apparent from the examples shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dedxdist ] . eventual asymmetries with respect to the generally assumed gaussian shape of the energy loss distributions have therefore to be carefully investigated as they will influence both the fitted central position and the extracted yields of the kaons .",
    "a detailed study of the shape of the @xmath39 distributions has therefore been performed both experimentally and by analytical calculation .    by selecting long tracks in the na49 tpc system which pass both through the vtpc and the mtpc detectors",
    "one may use the energy deposit in one of the tpc s to sharply select a specific particle type of high yield , for instance pions or protons .",

    "together with the relation :    @xmath50    assuming @xmath51  =  @xmath48 which is a safe assumption regarding the sizeable error in the determination of @xmath48 , @xmath52 is obtained as    @xmath53    a monte carlo simulation based on the photon absorption ionization ( pai ) model @xcite confirmed these results , demonstrating that the shape distortion is indeed a remnant of the basically asymmetric landau distribution of ionization energy loss .",
    "[ sec : dedx_shift ]    particle identification proceeds , in each defined bin of phase space , via a @xmath54 optimization procedure between the measured energy loss distributions and four single particle @xmath39 distributions of known shape but a priori unknown positions and widths for electrons , pions , kaons and protons , respectively . due to the generally small fraction of electrons and",
    "their position in the density plateau of the energy loss function , and due to the known dependence of the @xmath39 resolution on the @xmath39 value for each particle species @xcite , ( eq .  [ eq : resol ] ) , the problem reduces in practice to the determination of eight quantities : three absolute positions of the energy loss of @xmath25 , k , p , one width parameter and four yield values which correspond to the particle cross sections to be determined .",
    "if the fit of the pre - dominant particle species like pions and protons in general presents no problems , the situation is more critical for the kaons .",

[ fig : dedxkashift ] ) the related errors stay on the level of less than 1% up to @xmath30  =  0.2 . above this value",
    "the k@xmath21 yield reacts very critically on the fitted position .",
    "this is related to the proton yield which becomes rapidly overwhelming towards high @xmath30 . * concerning",
    "the rms width the situation is somewhat more critical especially for k@xmath21 . here , allowing for a systematic error of about 0.5% in the fitted relative rms , fig .",
    "[ fig : relsig ] , the corresponding yield error reaches values of about 2% at @xmath30  =  0.2 and about 10% at @xmath30",
    "this is again measuring the influence of the large proton fraction .",
    "for k@xmath22 on the other hand , the systematic error stays below the 2% level for the whole @xmath30 region investigated .",
    "the systematic errors estimated here have been included in the error estimation in table  [ tab : sys ] .",
    "[ sec : dedx_fit ]    the fitting procedure described above results in stable values for all eight parameters involved for @xmath30 values below about 0.25 for k@xmath21 and below 0.3 for k@xmath22 .",
    "this is to be understood in the sense that the @xmath54 optimization procedure converges to a well - defined minimum in all variables with reasonable values for the ratio of @xmath54 over the degrees of freedom . for higher @xmath30 values",
    "the fits tend to become unstable in the sense that certain variables tend to `` run away '' into unphysical configurations . in the present case of extraction of kaon yields",
    "this concerns basically only the kaon position in the @xmath39 variable and the rms width parameter of the energy loss distributions , as the pion and proton positions are always well constrained even in the critical regions of phase space .",
    "the problem is of course connected to the high sensitivity of the extracted kaon yield on these two parameters in relation to the small k/@xmath25 and k / p ratios as discussed in the preceding section .",
    "as the evolution of both the kaon position and the rms width with the phase space variables @xmath30 and @xmath29 shows no indication of any rapid variation up to the limits of fitting stability , and as indeed the geometrical configuration of the tracks in the tpc detectors shows a smooth and slow dependence on the track momenta in the regions concerned , it has been decided to extend the @xmath30 range up to 0.4 for k@xmath21 and to 0.5 for k@xmath22 by imposing constraints on the two critical parameters .",
    "this is realized by constraining the kaon position to fixed values with respect to the pions , as indicated by the extrapolated lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : dedxkashift ] , and by also fixing the rms widths to the values following from the smooth extrapolation indicated in fig .",

    "[ sec : dedx_stat ]    it has been shown in @xcite that the estimation of the statistical error of the extracted particle yields has to take into account the dependence of the fit result on all parameters fitted via the covariance matrix .",
    "this means that the inverse square root of the predicted numbers of each particle species is only a first approximation to the relative statistical error .",

    "there are several reasons for this situation :    * the study of soft hadronic production in elementary collisions is certainly not at the heart of the experimental programs at collider energies . on the contrary",
    "it is the discovery potential for `` new '' physics either in heavy ion interactions ( rhic ) or within and beyond the standard model ( p+@xmath0 colliders ) which defines the main priorities .",
    "* precision studies of elementary hadronic production call for specific constraints both concerning accelerator layout and operation ( as for instance vertex distributions and stability ) and the experimental set - ups ( trigger efficiency , data normalization , material budget at low total momenta ) . *",
    "the large multi - purpose detectors generally set up at the colliders are not really optimized for these constraints and small - size , dedicated experiments as they have been used in practically all the preceding lower energy work , are neither available nor planned .    in view of these problems in a first step the extrapolation of the isr results to @xmath28  =",
    "200 gev has been attempted in order to obtain a common point of comparison between isr extension , rhic and the lowest available p+@xmath0 collider energy . at this energy",
    "the ua5 streamer chamber data turn out to offer a reliable reference although the overall statistical errors are sizeable .",
    "this is reminiscent of the bubble chamber work at lower energies which definitely benefits from the application of optical methods in terms of reconstruction efficiency and normalization .",

    "<S> new data on the production of charged kaons in p+p interactions are presented . </S>",
    "<S> the data come from a sample of 4.8 million inelastic events obtained with the na49 detector at the cern sps at 158  gev / c beam momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the kaons are identified by energy loss in a large tpc tracking system . </S>",
    "<S> inclusive invariant cross sections are obtained in intervals from 0 to 1.7  gev / c in transverse momentum and from 0 to 0.5 in feynman x. using these data as a reference , a new evaluation of the energy dependence of kaon production , including neutral kaons , is conducted over a range from 3  gev to p+@xmath0 collider energies .    </S>",
