    "the top quark is special among the fermions of the standard model because of its large mass .",
    "currently , the top quark can only be studied at the two tevatron experiments cdf and d , where measurements of top quark production and properties are one of the key physics goals of run  ii .",
    "the top quark mass is discussed in a separate article@xcite .",
    "this article focuses on measurements of the total @xmath0 production cross - section , searches for new physics in @xmath0 production and top quark decay , and on the search for electroweak ( single ) top quark production .",
    "while the cdf and d  experiments have both collected more than @xmath2 of data so far during tevatron run  ii , surpassing the run  i  integrated luminosity by a factor @xmath35 , the measurements summarized in this article typically use about @xmath1 .    in section  [ topproduction.sec ] ,",
    "general aspects of top production and event topologies at the tevatron are briefly discussed .",
    "section  [ ttbarxs.sec ] discusses the measurements of the total @xmath0 production cross - section , while further measurements in @xmath0 events are presented in section  [ furtherttbar.sec ] .",
    "the search for single top quark production is presented in section  [ singletop.sec ] .",
    "in the standard model , the production of top quarks at a hadron collider can in principle proceed via two mechanisms : @xmath0 pair production via the strong interaction , and single top ( or antitop ) production via the electroweak interaction .",
    "the leading order feynman diagrams are shown in figure  [ feyndiag.fig ] together with the standard model cross - sections in @xmath4 collisions at a centre - of - mass energy of 1.96  tev ( corresponding to the tevatron collider at run  ii)@xcite .    in the following , the main characteristics of @xmath0 and single top events at the tevatron are discussed .      in the standard model",
    ", the branching fraction of top quark decays to a b quark and an on - shell @xmath5  boson is close to @xmath6 , other decay modes not being observable with tevatron luminosities .",
    "the subsequent @xmath5  decays determine the event topology seen in the detector , and @xmath0 events are classified as follows :    @xmath7    * dilepton events * , where both @xmath5  bosons decay into an @xmath8 or @xmath9 final state , are characterized by two energetic , isolated leptons of opposite charge , two energetic b jets , and missing transverse energy . while the product branching ratio is only about @xmath10",
    ", pure event samples can be obtained requiring the two leptons in the event to be reconstructed .    in * lepton+jets events * , one @xmath5  boson decays hadronically and the other into an @xmath8 or @xmath9 final state .",
    "this topology is characterized by an energetic , isolated electron or muon , four energetic jets ( two b jets and two light - quark jets from the @xmath5  decay ) , and missing transverse energy . the product branching ratio of @xmath11 is larger than for dilepton events , and",
    "the main background is from @xmath12+jets events .    in * hadronic events * , one expects 6 energetic jets ( of which two are b jets ) and no significant missing transverse energy . because of large backgrounds from qcd jet production , identifying @xmath0 events in the hadronic channel is challenging , despite the large product branching ratio of @xmath13 .    in about @xmath14 of the @xmath0 events , at least one @xmath5",
    "boson decays into a * @xmath15 final state*. depending on its decay , the @xmath16 lepton can be identified as a narrow jet , an isolated track , or an electron or muon .",
    "two energetic b jets , missing transverse energy , and the decay products from the second @xmath5  boson complete the event topology .    in general , the reconstruction and selection of @xmath0 event candidates is based on reconstructing the directions and energies / momenta of isolated electrons or muons and jets , and on reconstructing the missing transverse energy @xmath17 from the transverse momentum balance in the event . the purity of the event samples can be enhanced by identifying jets that originated from a b quark ( b tagging ) , since in the standard model , every @xmath0 event contains two b jets .",
    "both cdf and d  use    @xmath7    secondary vertex algorithms , based on explicit reconstruction of the decay vertex of the b hadron within the jet ;    impact parameter based algorithms that classify tracks inside a jet according to their distance of closest approach to the primary event vertex ; and    soft leptons from semileptonic bottom or charm hadron decay ( only muons are used so far )    to identify b jets",
    ". the requirements on the jet multiplicity , the minimum jet transverse energies , b identification of the jets , and event kinematic information can be balanced to minimize the measurement error ; depending on the selection , not all jets need to be explicitly reconstructed .",
    "the total cross - section for single top quark production is only a factor @xmath182 smaller than that for @xmath0 production ; however ,",
    "the relevant backgrounds are substantially larger ( @xmath5 + 2jet instead of @xmath5 + 4jet events ) . to reduce the background",
    ", the selection of single top event candidates focuses on top decays with leptonic @xmath12 decays and on the identification of the b jet(s ) in the event .",
    "figure  [ singletopdistributions.fig ] shows the expected pseudorapidity distributions of the charged lepton and jets in single top events . for s - channel events ,",
    "two b jets are expected in the center of the detector . in general only one b jet",
    "can be reconstructed in case of the t - channel , but here an additional light quark jet can be observed .",
    "the goal is to measure the @xmath0 cross - section in as many different modes as possible to check the predictions of the standard model .",
    "the measurements in the different channels are described in the following sub - sections .",
    "both cdf and d  have measured the @xmath0 cross - section in the lepton+jets channel without relying on b jet identification . in the cdf",
    "analysis@xcite , events with one isolated electron with @xmath19 or muon with @xmath20 , missing transverse energy @xmath21 , and at least 3 jets with @xmath22 within the pseudorapidity range @xmath23 are selected . for @xmath24 , there is an additional cut requiring the angle @xmath25 between the missing transverse energy and the highest @xmath26 jet in the transverse plane to satisfy @xmath27 .",
    "after this selection , the @xmath0 signal can be seen in the @xmath28 distribution ( @xmath28 is the scalar sum of transverse energies of the lepton , jets , and the missing transverse energy ) as shown in figure  [ cdfljetstopoxs.fig ] , and the @xmath0 cross - section is measured to be @xmath29 using a @xmath30 data sample . to optimise the measurement ,",
    "7 quantities have been chosen for training a neural network ( nn ) to separate the @xmath0 signal from the background .",
    "the nn output distribution is also shown in figure  [ cdfljetstopoxs.fig ] . from a fit to this distribution a result of @xmath31 is obtained from the same dataset . in both analyses , the main systematic error is from the uncertainty in the jet energy scale ; it is however reduced from @xmath32 in the @xmath28 based measurement to @xmath33 in the optimised analysis .    in the d  topological analysis@xcite , events with one isolated electron or muon with @xmath20 , missing transverse energy ( @xmath34 in the e+jets  case and @xmath35 for @xmath36+jets  events ) , and at least four jets with @xmath22 within @xmath37",
    "are selected .",
    "so in contrast to cdf , four jets are required to be reconstructed , but a larger pseudorapidity region is allowed . to further separate @xmath0 events from background ,",
    "a likelihood is constructed using angular variables and ratios of energy dependent variables , to avoid direct dependence on the jet energy scale .",
    "the resulting distributions are given in figure  [ dzeroljetstopoxs.fig ] .",
    "the combined fit to the e+jets  and @xmath36+jets  distributions from @xmath38 of data yields @xmath39      for the d  measurements that make use of lifetime b tagging information@xcite , events are selected with the same criteria as above . the @xmath0 cross - section is then determined from a combined fit to the jet multiplicity distributions for events with exactly one b tagged jet and events with at least two b tagged jets . using a data sample of @xmath40 , d  obtains @xmath41 using secondary vertex b tagging and @xmath42 with a track impact parameter based algorithm .",

    "d  analyzes events with a semimuonic bottom or charm decay , resulting in@xcite @xmath43 based on @xmath44 .",
    "several cdf analyses make use of b tagging information .",
    "the preselection of events requires one lepton , missing transverse energy , and three jets as in section  [ ljetstopoxs.sec ] .",

    "alternatively , the fraction of @xmath0 events in events with at least 3 jets is obtained from a fit to the @xmath26 distribution of the leading jet , which is also shown in figure  [ cdfljetsbtagxs.fig ] , yielding@xcite @xmath48    for the cdf multiple tag analysis , a special version of the b tagging algorithm has been developed with looser criteria to increase the statistics . from the jet multiplicity distributions obtained with the regular and the loose b tag ,",

    "when requiring at least one jet to be secondary vertex b tagged , the @xmath59 channel alone yields@xcite @xmath66 with a very high purity sample , see figure  [ dileptonxs.fig ] .      to separate @xmath0 events in the hadronic channel from the large multijet background , both tight kinematic cuts and b tagging information are applied .",
    "cdf selects events with 6 to 8 jets and no isolated leptons and applies kinematic cuts . in the distribution of the number of b",

    "cdf have searched for anomalous kinematic properties in their dilepton @xmath0 sample@xcite .",
    "four kinematic distributions where new physics signatures are expected to be likely to be seen were chosen a priori . while one of them , the leading lepton @xmath77 spectrum shown in figure  [ anomalouskinematics.fig ] , shows an excess at low transverse momenta in @xmath78 , the other distributions agree with the expectation .",

    ", one can either search for non - zero constributions from right - handed @xmath12 bosons ( @xmath87 ) or , assuming @xmath88 , for deviations from the predicted ratio @xmath89 .",
    "cdf have measured the fraction @xmath90 from the charged lepton @xmath77 spectrum ( using @xmath1 ) to be@xcite @xmath91 and from explicit reconstruction of the value of @xmath86 ( using @xmath47)@xcite to be @xmath92 respectively  to be compared with the d  run  i  value of@xcite @xmath93 .",

    "both analyses each yield a limit of @xmath95 to be compared with the cdf run  i  exclusion limit of @xmath96 at 95% confidence level@xcite .",
    "in supersymmetric models with @xmath97 , the top quark may decay into a charged higgs and a bottom quark . depending on the values of @xmath98 and @xmath99 ,",
    "one expects the following changes in the observed @xmath0 event topologies@xcite :    @xmath7    an excess of @xmath16 decays due to @xmath100 decays for large @xmath98 ,    an excess of hadronic top decays due to @xmath101 decays for small @xmath98 and small @xmath99 , or    @xmath0 events with two extra b jets from @xmath102 decays for small @xmath98 and large @xmath99 .",
    "the cdf collaboration has therefore taken their measurements of the @xmath0 cross - section in the dilepton and lepton+jets channels as well as their limit on @xmath103 events@xcite to place limits on @xmath104 decays in the @xmath99 vs.  @xmath98 plane , as shown in figure  [ chargedhiggslimits.fig ] .",

    "no significant excess of events has been observed , and the following 95% confidence level limits have been placed on the single top quark cross - section@xcite : @xmath114    with more data being taken and analysed and refined methods being developed , sensitivity for standard model single top quark production is within reach for tevatron run  ii .",
    "the current status of top quark measurements at the tevatron experiments cdf and d  has been summarized , with the exception of the results for the top quark mass which are covered in a separate article@xcite .",
    "a wealth of measurements of the total @xmath0 production cross - section are available from tevatron run  ii .",

    "the event samples have been further interpreted by looking for non - standard model @xmath0 production mechanisms and top quark decays .",
    "no signs for physics beyond the standard model have been found so far , supporting the interpretation of the signal as @xmath0 production via qcd and top quark decay to @xmath115 final states .    in the search for single ( electroweak ) production of top quarks ,",
    "the sensitivity of the experiments has been improved over run  i. even for standard model single top quark production , a significant cross - section measurement at the tevatron is within reach in the near future .",
