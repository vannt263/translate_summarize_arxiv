    "macroscopic flow properties are obtained by time averaging particle properties .",
    "if the averaging time is long enough , then accurate flow simulations can be obtained by a relatively small number of particles .",
    "variants of dsmc have been proposed over the years to improve solution accuracy in the presence of high density gradients  @xcite and for low mach number flows  @xcite . although particle - based methods are by far the most effective tools in describing non - equilibrium gas flows , they are not well suited to simulate unsteady gas flows . indeed , in this case the possibility of time averaging is lost or reduced .",
    "acceptable accuracy can only be achieved by increasing the number of simulation particles or superposing several flow snapshots obtained from statistically independent simulations of the same flow but , in both cases , the computing effort is considerably increased .",
    "the simulation of steady gas flows in the near continuum limit represents an additional challenge since the time scale on which the particle - based methods are forced to operate is much shorter than the characteristic macroscopic time and therefore explicit integration to steady state is computationally demanding .",
    "approaches based on a direct discretization of the boltzmann equation in the phase space are believed to be a feasible alternative in these cases since they provide solutions with high accuracy even in unsteady conditions and offer the possibility of a direct steady - state formulation  @xcite .",
    "as such , they have been applied to study several problems of both theoretical interest and practical importance , including the viscous gas damping in microfluidic devices  @xcite , the onset of instability in a rarefied gas environment  @xcite and the investigation of ghost effects  @xcite .",
    "deterministic methods of solution present some further assets compared to particle - based methods .",
    "firstly , they are more suited to be adopted within a domain decomposition approach since the need to exchange information between kinetic and macroscopic equations requires smooth numerical solutions  @xcite . secondly ,",
    "unlike particle - based methods their implementation on massively parallel computers with simd architecture , such as multi - core and gpu processors , can easily realize the full potential of these supercomputers  @xcite .",
    "these aspects also prompted the development of deterministic methods of solution .",
    "considerable progress has been accomplished in developing deterministic method for kinetic model equations  @xcite . by contrast , an accurate and efficient direct solution of the boltzmann equation itself remains a challenging problem .",
    "a common strategy adopted for solving eq .",
    "consists in decoupling the transport and the collision terms by time - splitting the evolution operator into a transport step and a collisional step .",
    "the transport step requires to solve a system of hyperbolic conservation laws coupled at the boundaries .",
    "their discretization can be performed in a variety of ways , including finite - difference , finite - volume , finite - element or spectral methods  @xcite .",
    "the collision step consists of solving a spatially homogeneous relaxation equation .",
    "this is the more computationally demanding part since it involves the computation of the bilinear five - fold integral defining the collision operator , eq .  .",
    "the numerical approaches to evaluate the collision step may be grouped into two broad categories . to the first category",
    "belong methods referred to as discrete velocity models ( dvm ) .",
    "they make use of a cartesian grid in velocity space and construct a discrete collision mechanics on the points of the grid that preserve the main physical properties of the collision integral , namely equilibrium states , collision invariants and entropy inequality  @xcite .",
    "dvm methods have high computational cost and low order of accuracy although fast algorithms have been recently developed for a restricted set of collision kernels  @xcite .",
    "to the second category belong methods which adopt a galerkin discretization of the velocity space .",
    "they are based on expanding the velocity dependence of the distribution function in a set of trial functions with expansion coefficients that depend on position and time .",
    "the galerkin ansatz is substituted in the space homogeneous relaxation equation which is subsequently multiplied by test functions and integrated in the velocity space . according to the galerkin approach , test and trial functions are assumed to be the same .",
    "the above procedure yields a system of hyperbolic partial differential equations for the expansion coefficients .",
    "galerkin methods can be further distinguished depending on the basis functions which they employ . in fourier - galerkin approach",
    ", the distribution function is expanded in trigonometric polynomials and the fast fourier transform is used to accelerate the computation of the collision integral in the velocity space .",
    "several different methods have been developed starting from different representation of the collision integral  @xcite .",
    "these methods are generally very efficient and spectrally accurate for smooth solutions .",
    "their major shortcoming is the loss of some of the properties of the solution such as positivity and conservation of momentum and energy .",
    "preservation of collision invariants can be enforced but the use of corrections procedure may limit the accuracy of the solutions .",
    "discontinuous galerkin methods adopt discontinuous piecewise polynomials as test and trial functions  @xcite .",
    "although computationally demanding , these methods have the remarkable feature to provide spectral accuracy in the velocity space even for discontinuous solutions which typically occur in the presence of solid surfaces .",
    "an hybrid approach is adopted in refs .",
    "@xcite where the distribution function is expanded in laguerre polynomials with respect to the velocity components parallel to solid surfaces whereas quadratic finite element functions have been used for the normal velocity component .",
    "this approach permits to explicitly account for the discontinuity of the distribution function and its application to one - dimensional problems has been shown to provide accurate numerical solutions in both linearized and non - linear regime",
    ".    the main objective of the present work is to propose a new approach to the deterministic solution of the boltzmann equation .",
    "the method uses a galerkin discretization of the velocity space and adopts , as trial and test functions , the collocation basis functions based on weights and roots of a gauss - hermite quadrature .",
    "the boltzmann equation is thus simplified to a system of hyperbolic conservation laws with non - linear source terms in the physical space . a fully discrete numerical scheme",
    "can then be derived by using standard approaches  @xcite . the method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite shows strong similarities with the present work but it differs in two significant respects . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the method is developed for a system of linear boltzmann equations and the collocation basis functions have been defined only on the basis of full - range hermite polynomials .",
    "by contrast , we are here concerned with the non - linear boltzmann equation and the roots and weights of the half - range gauss - hermite quadrature formula also enter in the definition of the collocation basis functions .",
    "half - range hermite polynomials have been widely used to study flow and heat transfer problems in rarefied gas dynamics  @xcite and the milne problem in radiative transfer  @xcite . in comparison with full - range hermite polynomials , they allow to deal exactly with boundary conditions and to achieve a faster convergence rate in the presence of discontinuous distribution functions .",
    "+ the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : ii ] illustrates the method of solution in detail .",
    "section  [ sec : iii ] covers two aspects .",
    "firstly , the spectral accuracy of the proposed velocity space discretization is illustrated by a comparison with the exact solution of the spatially homogeneous relaxation for maxwellian molecules .",
    "secondly , the possibilities of the proposed method are demonstrated by solving the two - dimensional driven cavity flow of a gas composed by hard - sphere molecules for different knudsen and mach numbers .",
    "section  [ sec : iv ] summarizes the main results and the future research directions .",
    "the numerical scheme to deterministically solve the boltzmann equation is derived through a two - step procedure . as a first step , eq .",
    "is rewritten in terms of the deviational part of the distribution function , @xmath24 , defined as @xmath25\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the maxwellian at equilibrium with uniform and constant density @xmath27 and temperature @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath29 as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the use of @xmath30 permits to greatly improve the accuracy of the method of solution when the gas approaches equilibrium since it reduces the truncation errors which arise in evaluating eq .   for distribution functions close to maxwellian .",
    "in this respect , an equilibrium distribution function which depends on space and time , @xmath31 , may be also adopted in eq .   to further increase accuracy of the computations .",
    "the applicability of the method , however , is not affected by this choice . substituting eq .   into eq .",

    ".   simplifies to the linearized boltzmann equation .",
    "the present formulation in terms of the deviational part of the distribution function , however , is not restricted to a vanishing perturbation and it is valid in the non - linear case as well .",
    "+ as a second step , we seek an approximate solution of eq .   by using a galerkin approach .",
    "a suitable finite dimensional linear space of orthonormal trial functions @xmath34 is chosen and the deviational part of the distribution function is expanded in a series of the form    @xmath35    inserting eq .   into eq",

    "the sake of simplicity , let us consider a fixed plane wall at @xmath44 with temperature @xmath45 .",
    "let us further suppose that the gas fills the half space @xmath46 and molecules which strike the wall are re - emitted according to the maxwell s scattering kernel with complete accommodation  @xcite . in terms of the deviational distribution function , the boundary condition reads @xmath47 substituting eq .   into eq .  , multiplying both side by @xmath34 and integrating with respect to the velocity variable @xmath6 , yields @xmath48 where @xmath49    several methods of solution for the boltzmann equation employ a galerkin discretization of the velocity space but very different numerical schemes are derived due to the different trial and test functions  @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we adopt the collocation basis functions based on weights , @xmath50 , and roots , @xmath51 , of the gaussian quadrature formula defined by means of half- and/or full - range hermite polynomials , i.e. , @xmath52 with @xmath53 as given by eq .",
    "( see appendix  a for further details ) .",
    "a first consequence of this choice is that , by virtue of eq .  , expansion coefficients are proportional to the values of the deviational part of the distribution function at the quadrature roots @xmath51 , that is @xmath54 .",
    "the proposed method of solution is thus closely related to discrete velocity methods .",

    "may involve polynomials of higher order depending on the differential cross section , their numerical evaluation is approximated .",

    "a fully discrete numerical scheme is derived by a first - order time splitting of the evolution operator which couples a first - order finite - volume scheme for the transport step with a first - order explicit euler scheme for the relaxation step .",
    "however , more sophisticated methods can be used for coupling and solving both transport and relaxation steps .",
    "numerical results have been presented for the space homogeneous relaxation to equilibrium of maxwell molecules and the two - dimensional cavity flow of a gas composed by hard - sphere molecules .",
    "overall , the numerical results are affected by an error of less than a few percent .",
    "+ the proposed method of solution has a number of attracting features such as explicit identification and exact treatment of boundary conditions , spectral accuracy in the velocity space and preservation of the collision invariants . while the method can in principle handle a wide range of knudsen and mach numbers , it turns out to be feasible only in dealing with slightly rarefied low mach number gas flows .",
    "the main obstacle is the large number of operations required to evaluate the collision integral .",
    "however , a preliminary study indicates that the numerical code possesses very good scalability on a memory distributed cluster of gpus and supercomputing architectures like ibm blue gene / q . a throughly discussion of these parallel implementations will be the subject of a future publication .",
