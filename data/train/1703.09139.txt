    "the magnetic field and turbulence play important roles in the early phase of star formation .",

    "the magnetic field therefore has the potential to control the gravitational collapse of cloud cores .",

    "the magnetic field extracts angular momentum from the circumstellar disks and the infalling envelopes , due to magnetic braking and outflows . as a consequence , the protostars accrete gas from the disks . in the past decade , the existence of the so - called `` magnetic braking catastrophe '' has been debated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; in this phenomenon , the magnetic field prevents the formation of the circumstellar disks around the protostars .",
    "axisymmetric models have been investigated intensively , and they show that circumstellar disks are formed around the protostar .",

    "their simulations reproduced the formation of the outflow but not that of disks , because the period simulated was too short .",

    "the formation mechanism for such misaligned systems is not yet known .    in this paper , we use high - resolution numerical simulations to investigate the collapse of cloud cores to form protostars , and we include the effects of the magnetic field and turbulence of the cloud core . the formation of circumstellar disks and outflows is also investigated . in the simulations , it is expected that misaligned protostars will be formed , because a priori rotation axes are not assumed in the initial conditions .",

    ", the disk normal vector @xmath136 is aligned with the mean angular momentum @xmath135 , indicating that the disk is aligned with the rotation axis . the flow direction on this scale",
    "is contaminated by the velocity associated with the formation of a cavity ( see the right bottom panel of figure  [ jets.eps ] ) .",
    "the direction of the angular momentum vector depends on the radius of the cloud core , as shown in figure  [ directions.eps ] .",
    "this indicates that the disk accretes lumps of gas for which the angular momentum vectors have highly nonuniform directions .",
    "the angular momentum of the infalling gas greatly affects the evolution of the disk , as shown in @xcite .",
    "as the disk further evolves , its orientation and size are both expected to change .",
    "observations of misalignment between outflows , magnetic field , circumstellar disks , and flattened envelopes have been reported .",
    "@xcite showed that outflows are misaligned or randomly aligned relative to the magnetic field on the @xmath0  au scale for class 0 and class i objects , and this is consistent with the results of the models considered here , which predicted that the direction of the magnetic field depends on the scale length ( see , e.g. , figure  [ directions_t.eps ] ) , though the outflow accelerates along the magnetic field on the @xmath2  au scale . if the outflow is aligned with the acceleration , it is expected to be misaligned with the magnetic field on the @xmath0  au scale .",
    "observations of the class i source l1489 irs have suggested that the central keplerian disk is inclined with respect to the flattened infalling envelope @xcite .",
    "this misalignment between the central disk and the flattened envelope was reproduced in all the models we considered , as shown in figure  [ directions.eps ] . in each model ,",
    "the disk normal vector @xmath136 ( the green line ) drifts on the @xmath138 plane , indicating that with the flattened density structure , the inclination depends on the radius .",
    "moreover , @xmath136 is aligned with @xmath132 when @xmath139  au , suggesting that the inclination of the flattened envelope is guided by the magnetic field . in other words , the flattened density structure of the envelope",
    "is caused by the magnetic field .",
    "such a misaligned system can not be reproduced by axisymmetric models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "even if weak turbulence is assumed , misaligned systems are reproduced .",
    "the rim of the cavity has a higher column density than does the envelope , as shown in figure  [ colmndensity_m1b025_50au.eps ] , and it may be observed as an arc - like structure .",
    "@xcite reported that the alma cycle 0 observations reveal an arc - like structure at the center of the high - density molecular cloud core mc27 or l1521f .",
    "the arc - like structure was extended to a length of @xmath140  au , and they proposed that it was caused by a dynamical interaction between the dense gas condensation and the envelope . @xcite performed hydrodynamical simulations to determine the origin of the arc - like structure , and they demonstrated that gravitational torque due to the orbiting protostars produces arc - like structures extending up to 1000  au .    the typical length of the cavity is consistent with the observations of mc27/l1521f .",
    "the rim of the cavity obtained with the model m1b025 was extended to @xmath117  au at @xmath141  yr . if we assume that the cavity continues to extend at a constant velocity of @xmath142 ( see section  [ sec : cavity_formation ] ) , it takes @xmath143  yr for the rim to extended to 1000  au .",
    "this timescale agrees with that of the arc structures reproduced by @xcite , and it is also consistent with the timescale of the protostar ( _ spizer _ source ) in mc27/l1521f .",
    "the rim of the cavity can account for the dense gas condensations in mc27/l1521f .",
    "our simulation results indicate that the number density of the rim is @xmath144 on the 50  au scale .",
    "when the cavity is expanded up to 1000  au , the number density of the rim is expected to be @xmath145 , assuming that the density is distributed as @xmath146 .",
    "the number densities of the dense gas condensations , mms-2 and mms-3 , are estimated to be @xmath147 and @xmath148 , respectively @xcite .",
    "therefore , and can be explained by the dense portions of the rim rather than by the fragments .    on the other hand , between the rim and the cavity , the column density differs by a factor of @xmath149 ; the column densities are @xmath150 on the rim and @xmath151 in the cavity ( figure  [ colmndensity_m1b025_50au.eps ] ) .",
    "such a high contrast in the column density has not been seen in observations of the alma cycle  1 ( see figure  3b of * ? ? ?",
    "observations of the magnetic field of the cloud core will be of key importance in determining which model best accounts for the origin of the arc - like structure .",
    "gravitational collapse of molecular cloud cores and the formation of circumstellar disks and outflows around protostars were investigated by performing amr simulations ; the effects of both turbulence and the magnetic field were considered .",
    "ohmic dissipation was considered in the mhd simulations .",
    "we allowed the system to evolve for @xmath0  yr following the formation of a protostar .",
    "the main outcomes are summarized as follows .    1 .   in each of the magnetized models",
    ", the cloud core collapses to form a protostar surrounded by a circumstellar disk .",
    "the star - disk system is surrounded by an infalling envelope , and bipolar outflows are ejected .",
    "the nonmagnetized models produce massive circumstellar disks , one of which undergoes fragmentation at @xmath152  yr following the formation of a protostar .",
    "2 .   the radius of the circumstellar disk depends on the initial strength of the magnetic field .",
    "models with a stronger magnetic field produce a circumstellar disk with a smaller radius .",
    "the mass of the disk shows a similar dependence on the magnetic field , where a stronger field produces a less massive disk .",
    "the ratio of disk mass to stellar mass remains roughly constant at about @xmath153% , depending on the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "the magnetized models reproduce the outflow , which can be classified into two types : a magnetocentrifugal wind and a spiral flow . in the latter ,",
    "the outflow is not aligned with the rotational axis of the disk . in both the cases ,",
    "the outflow and the flattened envelope are aligned with the magnetic field on that scale . in some models ,",
    "the outflow is misaligned with the circumstellar disk .",
    "similarly , the flattened envelope may be misaligned with the circumstellar disk .",
    "4 .   the internal distribution of angular momentum in the cloud cores is nonuniform .",
    "after long - term evolution , the disk accretes lumps of gas in which the direction of the angular momentum vectors is highly nonuniform ; hence , the disk is expected to change its orientation and size .",
    "this means that a planet formed during a later phase may have an orbital angular momentum that is highly misaligned with the angular momentum of the central star .",
    "a strong magnetic field tends to produce a cavity in the infalling envelope ; this is due to the strong magnetic pressure , and the gas accumulates on the rim .",
    "thus , the rim can account for the arc - like structure and dense gas condensation observed in the high - density molecular cloud core mc27/l1521f , though it has not been verified by observation that there is a high contrast between the column density of the cavity and that of the rim .",
    "we would like to thank k. tokuda , t. onishi , k. tomida , r. kawabe , and n. ohashi for fruitful discussions .",
    "numerical computations were carried out on the cray xc30 and xt4 at the center for computational astrophysics , national astronomical observatory of japan , and the hitachi ha8000 clustre system ( t2k - todai ) in the information technology center , the university of tokyo .",
    "this research was supported by jsps kakenhi grant numbers 16h02160 , 15k05032 , 26400233 , 26287030 , 25400232 , 24244017 , 23540270 , and 23244027 .",
    "the disk radius for each model was estimated using the density and velocity distributions , as follows .",
    "the volume of the disk @xmath154 was defined by two criteria : @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "the former indicates that the disk has a density higher than the critical density of the equation of state .",
    "the latter indicates that the velocity of rotation is greater than the radial velocity . in spherical coordinates , the velocity is @xmath157 , which was calculated by a transformation from cartesian coordinates with the origin set at the location of the sink particle .",
    "because the disk orientation is not aligned to any of the coordinate axes , the tangential velocity of @xmath158 was adopted as the rotational velocity .",
    "the value of three on the right - hand side of the second criterion was determined empirically .",
    "the disk radius was obtained from the inertia tensor of the volume , @xmath154 .",
    "the inertia tensor is calculated as @xmath159 and each element of the matrix is calculated by a moment of the coordinates , e.g. , @xmath160 where @xmath161 are the coordinates of a cell , and @xmath162 is the position vector for a sink particle .",
    "the volume integrals in equation  ( [ eq : appendix_ixx ] ) were performed by summing over the cells within the volume , @xmath154 .",
    "the matrix @xmath163 yields three eigenvalues , @xmath164 , and the square root of each of the eigenvalues corresponds to the length of a principal axis ; @xmath165 , @xmath166 , and @xmath167 correspond to the semi - major axis , the semi - minor axis , and the thickness of the disk , respectively . the semi - minor axis @xmath166 was adopted as the disk radius so that this method could be applied to a highly elongated disk , such as the disk of model m1b025 ( the lower right panel of figure  [ 25au.eps ] ) .",
    "the disk radius is defined as @xmath168 where the factor of two comes from the inertial tensor for a uniform thin disk with a radius of @xmath169 , i.e. , @xmath170 .",
    "we also calculated the mass of the disks using @xmath171 where @xmath154 is the disk volume .",
    "in figures  [ directions.eps ] and [ directions_t.eps ] , the direction of the magnetic field , angular momentum , disk , and outflow are each shown as a function of the radius .",
    "these axes were measured as follows .    in order to define the direction of the magnetic field and angular momentum , we measured the mean magnetic field and the angular momentum : @xmath172 where @xmath173 the volume @xmath174 is that of a sphere with radius @xmath6 , and the center coincides with the position of the sink particle : @xmath175 and @xmath176 , respectively , denote the position and velocity of the sink particle .",
    "the orientation of the disk was calculated using the eigenvector of the inertia tensor , which is similar to @xmath163 in equation ( [ eq : inertia_matrix ] ) .",
    "the elements of the inertia tensor are obtained as follows .",
    "@xmath177 where the integration is performed inside the region in which @xmath178 , for a given threshold @xmath179 .",
    "the eigenvector associated with the smallest eigenvalue represents a normal vector for the flattened disk - like structure .",
    "the radius of the disk - like structure is defined as the maximum extent of the region in which @xmath180 , as measured from the position of the sink particle .",
    "thus , we obtain the direction of the disk normal vector @xmath136 as a function of the radius @xmath6 .",
    "note that the disk measured here corresponds to the circumstellar disk for a small radius , e.g. , @xmath181  au , and to the flattened infalling envelope for a large radius .",
    "the direction of the outflow was obtained from the flow of the gas inside the outflow region . because the outflow is bipolar and the gas flows roughly parallel to the magnetic field",
    ", the direction of the outflow is calculated as follows .",
