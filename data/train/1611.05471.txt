    "high - energy exclusive ( elastic ) processes with various beams and targets provide information on the distribution of scattering centers in the target in the plane perpendicular to the beam direction ( the impact parameter plane ) , which makes possible the transverse imaging of the target .",
    "its examples are well - known and numerous .",
    "measuring the intermediate energy elastic scattering of electrons and protons on nuclei allows one to reconstruct the charge and matter ( proton+neutron ) distributions in nuclei , respectively .",
    "the data on elastic proton  proton scattering at high energies are widely used to learn about the proton profile in the impact parameter space .",
    "the recent relativistic analyses of elastic form factors of hadrons ( proton , neutron , pion ) measured in elastic scattering were carried out in terms of the transverse quark densities . more generally , generalized parton distribution functions ( gpds ) accessed in hard exclusive processes encode information of the quark and gluon distributions in a given target ( including transitions between the hadronic states ) in terms of light - cone momentum fractions and the impact parameter .",
    "thus , they at least in principle hold the promise for obtaining a three - dimensional picture of hadrons and nucleus in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , which is one of the key objectives of the physics program of a future electron - ion collider  @xcite .    part of this program involving high energy quasireal photons overlaps with studies of proton  proton , proton  nucleus and nucleus  nucleus ultraperipheral collisions ( upcs )  @xcite at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "in particular , during run 1 in pb - pb upcs , the alice collaboration measured coherent photoproduction of @xmath1 mesons on heavy nuclei and the alice  @xcite and cms  @xcite collaborations measured coherent @xmath2 photoproduction on nuclei .",
    "comparison of these data with numerous model calculations  @xcite demonstrated that the best agreement is observed only if the calculations account for the effect of strong nuclear shadowing , which suppresses the @xmath1 photoproduction cross section by approximately a factor of six and the @xmath2 cross section by approximately a factor of three .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the gribov ",
    "glauber approach to nuclear shadowing combined with phenomenology of real and virtual photon diffraction  @xcite provides a good description of the data . while the statistics of @xmath1 and @xmath2 photoproduction in run i was insufficient for the detailed study of the transverse momentum distributions of vector mesons in these processes , some hints of such shifting have been observed by both alice  @xcite and star  @xcite collaborations .",
    "the much higher statistics of run 2 at the lhc allows one to study the influence of strong nuclear shadowing on the transverse momentum distributions .    in this paper , using the theoretical approaches describing well the available data from run 1 , we extend our previous study  @xcite and calculate the momentum transfer distributions for coherent photoproduction of @xmath1 and @xmath2 vector mesons on nuclei in pb - pb upcs in run 2 at the lhc .",
    "we show that nuclear shadowing not only suppresses the absolute value of the cross sections , but also changes the shape of the differential cross sections by shifting the momentum transfer distributions toward smaller values of the momentum transfer @xmath3 .",
    "one can interpret these results as an effective broadening in the impact parameter space of the nucleon density in nuclei in the case of @xmath1 and the nuclear gluon distribution in the case of @xmath2 .",
    "it is a generic and model - independent consequence of the fact that nuclear shadowing suppression at small impact parameters is stronger than that at the nucleus periphery .",

    "<S> using the theoretical approaches describing well the available data on @xmath0-integrated coherent photoproduction of light and heavy vector mesons in pb - pb upc at the lhc in run 1 , we calculate the momentum transfer distributions for this process for @xmath1 and @xmath2 vector mesons in the kinematics of run 2 at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that nuclear shadowing not only suppresses the absolute value of the cross sections , but also shifts the momentum transfer distributions toward smaller values of the momentum transfer @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this result can be interpreted as a broadening in the impact parameter space of the effective nucleon density in nuclei by 14% in the case of @xmath1 and the nuclear gluon distribution by 5 - 11% in the case of @xmath2 . </S>"
