    "big - bang nucleosynthesis and quasar absorption line studies ( at @xmath3 ) determine the same mass fraction of baryons in the universe : @xmath4 ( e.g. , fukugita , hogan , and peebles 1998 ) .",
    "it was expected that this gas would become the galaxies of today , but a census of stars and gas in galaxies in the local universe accounts for only about 20% of the baryonic mass .",
    "this is the `` missing '' baryon problem that has drawn much attention , for which the leading solution is that the baryons have remained as dilute gas ( e.g. , fukugita , hogan , and peebles 1998 ; cen and ostriker 1999a ; dav et al .",
    "however , the ly@xmath0 forest becomes less dense in the local universe by about a factor of 3 - 4 compared to the number of absorption systems at fixed equivalent width at z = 3 .",
    "this decrease in the baryons is not balanced by the increase in the stellar mass , leading to the conclusion that a significant mass of gas must be hot , above 10@xmath5 k.    there is a prediction for the properties of the missing baryons from hierarchical models of structure formation .",
    "the most visible large structures are clusters of galaxies , which are deep potential wells of high overdensity , but these clusters are relatively rare . the more common collapsed systems are groups of galaxies and the large filaments that connect the groups and clusters .",
    "groups of galaxies are weak emitters of x - rays , indicating gas at 0.32@xmath6 k but with extended gaseous masses that are very poorly known because their extent is broad and their surface brightness fades below the detectability of x - ray instruments at a fraction of the virial radius .",
    "it is the filaments that contain most of the volume in collapsed structures and here the temperature is generally lower , typically @xmath7@xmath8 k , according to theoretical calculations ( e.g. , cen et al .",
    "there have been no convincing detections of these filaments in emission , but there is good evidence that gas is present at these temperatures , as absorption is detected by both hst and fuse in observations toward bright agns ( e.g. , savage et al .",
    "gas bearing occurs when @xmath9 k , a temperature expected in filaments , and because this doublet is strong and oxygen is the most abundant heavy element , this is an excellent tracer of such gas .",
    "these observations show that absorption is common , @xmath10 for @xmath11 m  ( tripp and savage 2000 ) .",
    "it is predicted that the absorption lies in a network of filaments with modest overdensities of 1040 ( cen et al .",
    "2001 ) as well as in the galaxy groups ( hellsten et al .",
    "1998 ) . when is present , a small fraction of hydrogen is still neutral , so the lyman series lines of accompany as a tracer .",
    "the goal of our effort is to identify the likely locations of these filaments and then to determine whether and absorption is associated with them .",
    "theoretical simulations guide us to the most likely location of filaments ( evrard et al .",
    "2002 ) , which shows that they generally connect rich clusters , sothe objects with the highest frequency of filaments ( and the largest covering factor ) are the superclusters of galaxies",
    ". these are generally several galaxy clusters near each other on the sky and with only modest velocity differences , so they are physically close in space . in this study , we examine three agns that have already been observed in the ultraviolet either by the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( _ fuse _ ) , or by the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) , and each of these show absorption near the redshift of the supercluster behind which they are projected .",
    "we analyze the properties of these absorption features and discuss the implication for the detection of the `` cosmic web '' of filaments .",
    "practical aspects of observing , involving the identification of suitably bright agns , drive us toward using the nearby superclusters as the optimum absorption sites .",
    "nearby superclusters subtend a large solid angle ( with known redshift ) , which is very helpful for finding sufficiently bright background agns . also , most of the brightest agns are nearby , typically seyfert galaxies at z @xmath12 0.1 , so the superclusters must be at lower redshift , which are the closest superclusters .",
    "another consideration is that numerical simuations suggest that filaments connect clusters in a near - linear fashion , so the background agn should lie close to loci connecting clusters .",
    "the tangential dimensions of the filaments ( at an overdensity of 10 ) are predicted to be the same size as the virial radii of the galaxy clusters ( @xmath13 3 mpc ; cen and ostriker 1999b ) , so background agns should be within this distance of the line connecting clusters , although , as this is a theoretical prediction , we will include agns that are not so ideally aligned .",
    "superclusters have been cataloged out to a distance of @xmath14 ( einasto et al .",
    "they have catalogued 220 superclusters using a friends - of - friends algorithm with a neighborhood radius of @xmath15 mpc .",
    "we visually identified the most likely locations of filaments connecting galaxy clusters within superclusters and searched for uv - bright agns projected behind them , using the updated vron - cetty & vron ( 2001 ) catalog and at low galactic @xmath16 as given by schlegel , finkbeiner , and davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "about ten objects satisfy our criteria and are bright enough to be observed by _",
    "hst _ or _ fuse _ and we have an observing program to obtain spectra of these targets .",
    "however , three targets have already been observed by _ fuse _ and _ hst _ ( phl 1811 , pg 1402 + 261 and ton s180 ) , which we report upon here .",
    "the locations of these three targets , relative to the foreground superclusters , are shown in figure 1 , where we indicate the position of clusters of galaxies and the size of the crosses represent the richness of the cluster as defined in dekel & ostriker ( 1999 ) .",
    "the value for the cluster with maximum richness is given and the values for the other clusters can be estimated by the size of the crosses ( in unit steps ) . also shown are the agns ( empty diamond ) and the estimated 2-d location of the relevant filaments , where the thickness of the filaments is approximately @xmath17 mpc .",

    "confirmation of this feature through the detection of some other lyman series lines is a commonly used tool when the wavelength coverage is broad .",
    "unfortunately , nearly all of the strong lines lie in places in which it is difficult to detect a line uniquely .",
    "that is , the ly@xmath1 line would lie at 1084.3  , but it would be confused with the strong galactic @xmath261084.0 line , so a unique idenfitication is not possible .  also , the feature does not fall in the lif1a channel , but the sic1a channel , where the s / n is significantly lower .",
    "we estimate that the 3@xmath27 upper limit to the ly@xmath1 line is about 0.25  , which is much larger than the expected value of 0.03   if ly@xmath0 were optically thin .",

    "we do not have ly@xmath0 equivalent widths for all of the systems discussed above because in some , only ly@xmath1 was detected without blending , as for the @xmath610.0770.081 absorption line systems in phl1811 .",
    "however , if the ratio of ly@xmath1/ly@xmath0 is about 0.5 , as found for other systems of similar equivalent widths ( shull et al .",
    "2000 ) , then the ly@xmath62 equivalent widths are above the 0.24 threshold ( probably about 0.4  ) and the sum of the three lines have an equivalent width of 1.73  , consistent with this estimation ( jenkins et al .",

    "however , as the clearly shows evidence for absorption , we will consider the effect of including this system in the analysis . finally , the absorption line from pg 1402 + 261 is slightly below the threshold , so we will consider the results of the analysis with and without this system .",
    "the next issue is how one counts a system and over what velocity width .",
    "the most conservative approach is to count multiple absorption line systems as a single absorption system ( i.e. , the 0.077 - 0.081 systems in phl1811 and the 0.0616 - 0.0630 systems in ton s180 ) even though the determination for dn / dz includes all redshift systems .",
    "the absorption line systems discussed above fall within @xmath461300 km s@xmath2 ( @xmath63 0.0043 in redshift space ) of the expected redshift of the filament or nearby cluster , so we should expect 0.24 absorption systems per supercluster . if we use only phl 1811 , there are absorption systems associated with two superclusters ( excluding the @xmath54 system and counting the systems at @xmath53 and 0.07900 as a single system ) , which should occur by chance 4.6% of the time ( for dn / dz @xmath1328 ) .",
    "using the rate for absorption system equivalent widths above 0.36   ( appropriate for these absorption systems ; dn / dz @xmath1315 ) , the chance probability is 1.5% .",
    "if we include the absorption system from pg1402 + 261 , the probability of this occurring by chance falls to 1.4% ( for dn / dz @xmath1328 ; if we were to include the absorption from ton s180 as a single system , the chance probability would become 0.3% ) .",
    "when we include all of the absorption systems separately , the association between superclusters and absorption features becomes more likely , as there would be three absorption systems in the redshift range 0.077 - 0.081 in phl1811 and three in the redshift range 0.0616 - 0.0630 in ton s180 . excluding ton s180 , the probability that the association with the superclusters occurred by chance is 9@xmath64 ( 1.1@xmath65 excluding the @xmath54 system ) , and when ton s180 is included , the probability becomes 1.7@xmath66 ( 2.2@xmath67 excluding the z = 0.08093 system ) .",
    "it is difficult at this point to demonstrate that the absorption is associated with regions of mild overdensities ( filaments ) rather than material that has been ejected or torn away from a galaxy .",
    "one would need to be able to determine if absorbing material is gravitationally bound to the galaxy , which would involve assuming a model for the galaxy as well as for the transverse velocity of the absorbing gas relative to the galaxy .",
    "also , the distinction between these two associations may be unimportant , as material expelled in a galactic wind is unbound to that galaxy and becomes part of the filament once it mixes with this surrounding medium .",
    "an alternative approach to looking for evidence of absorption from galaxy clusters and superclusters is to choose bright but randomly located agns and identify the absorption sites by obtaining imaging and spectroscopy of nearby objects .",
    "along these lines , penton , stocke , and shull ( 2002 ) found that about 22% of absorbers are not associated with galaxies ( also , mclin et al .",
    "they find support that absorption line systems align with large - scale filaments of galaxies , which may be similar in nature to the filaments that we have tried to probe .",
    "the association of absorption systems with supercluster filaments or galaxy clusters may seem surprising since a dedicated search to find absorbing gas in galaxy clusters failed to produce detections ( miller , bregman , and knezek 2002 ) . however , that study was sensitive only to low ionization metal lines , not to the more common ly@xmath0 absorption line systems ( or to ) .",
    "given the results here , a search to identify ly@xmath0 systems around galaxy clusters would be worthwhile .",
    "the relationship between superclusters and ly@xmath0 absorption systems is enticing , but it is based on the study of just three systems , and it should be possible to improve the statistical situation quite readily . in the near future , we will be investigating several other low redshift superclusters ( z @xmath12 0.12 ) to search for ly@xmath0 absorption systems .",
    "another observation that is badly needed is to obtain redshifts for the clusters that are near the lines of sight .",
    "we hope that studies such as those will lead to a deeper understanding of whether modest overdensity cosmological filaments can be identified through ly@xmath0 absorption line studies .",
    "after this paper was submitted , it was pointed out to us that there is evidence of a ly@xmath0 absorber associated with the supercluster recently discovered from the _ rosat _ north ecliptic pole survey ( nep ) .",
    "the nep supercluster ( mullis et al . 2001 ) is at an average redshift of 0.087 and is x - ray selected .",
    "it subtends a large angular region , where about 200 agns are found .",
    "one of them is bright enough for absorption line studies and was previously observed by hst , h1821 + 643 ( nep5340 ) .",
    "spectral analyses of h1821 + 643 ( z=0.297 ) revealed the presence of a ly@xmath0 system at @xmath68 ( tripp , lu & savage 1998 ) .",
    "the nearest galaxy cluster is at a projected distance of 18 h@xmath2 mpc , well beyond the virial radius ; no galaxy is identified near the absorption site .",
    "these observations are consistent with the absorber being associated with diffuse gas connecting the nep clusters .",
    "as our selection criteria did not include this supercluster , we do not include it in our statistical analysis , but it supports our findings for the other superclusters .",
    "we would like to acknowledge support for this work from nasa grants nag5 - 10765 and nag5 - 10806 , which support research on archival data analysis .",
    "also , we would like to thank b - g andersen , ken sembach , bart wakker , jimmy irwin , chris mullis , and edward lloyd - davies for their advice and encouragement .",
