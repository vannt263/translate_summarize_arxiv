    "a series of previous papers studied the influence of the processes of radiative charge exchange in symmetric @xmath1 and @xmath2 collisions and corresponding photo - association / dissociation processes on the opacity of stelar atmospheres . in the hydrogen case",
    ", these processes were shown to be important for the atmospheres of the sun and some da white dwarfs @xcite ; in the helium case , for the atmospheres of some db and da white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "thus , the mentioned papers made it clear that at least symmetric ion - atom radiative collisions play a significant role in stellar atmospheres .",
    "but the question whether some non - symmetric ion - atom radiative processes can also influence the optical characteristics of the considered stellar atmospheres is still open .",
    "a detailed study of such non - symmetric processes in connection with the stellar atmospheres would require very extensive research , and remains a task for the future .",
    "the aim of this short article is to point out at least some objects where such processes could be of interest , and to show the possible ways of describing their influence . for this purpose",
    "it was natural to start from the same db white dwarfs and the solar atmosphere ( which were considered in previous papers , since adequate models exist for them ) . in the case of db white dwarfs we mean models presented in @xcite , as well as in @xcite .",
    "the necessary models of the solar atmosphere were described in @xcite and @xcite , and in @xcite .",
    "the composition of the mentioned models and the previous results for the ion - atom symmetric radiative process suggest that in the considered atmospheres the following non - symmetric absorption processes have to be taken into account @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the molecular ions in the corresponding electronic ground states , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 - a metal atom and its ground - state ion . in the general case , apart from these absorption processes , the corresponding inverse emission processes should also be considered . however , it can be shown that , under the conditions of plasma taken from the models mentioned above , the significance of such emission processes can be neglected in comparison with other relevant emission processes . in this work",
    "we will consider the absorption processes ( [ eq : heh1 ] ) and ( [ eq : heh2 ] ) in connection with db white dwarfs and solar atmospheres , and the processes ( [ eq : hx1 ] ) and ( [ eq : hx2 ] ) with @xmath14 and @xmath15 - in connection with the solar and so - called lithium stars atmospheres .",
    "the ground and first excited electronic state of the considered molecular ion ( @xmath10 or @xmath11 ) will be denoted here by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and the corresponding adiabatic potential curves - by @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the internuclear distance . by @xmath21",
    "will be denoted the modulus of the dipole matrix element for the transition @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the operator of dipole moment of @xmath25 . keeping in mind the results of the previous papers",
    ", we will treat the non - symmetric radiative processes ( [ eq : heh1 ] ) - ( [ eq : hx2 ] ) within the dipole approximation where the data about @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath21 are sufficient for all the necessary calculations . in accordance with @xcite and",
    "@xcite the quantum - mechanical treatment is applied here to the photo - dissociative processes ( [ eq : heh1 ] ) and ( [ eq : hx1 ] ) , while the absorption charge exchange processes ( [ eq : heh2 ] ) and ( [ eq : hx2 ] ) are described within the semi - classical approximation .",
    "the efficiencies of the photo - dissociative process ( [ eq : heh1 ] ) and ( [ eq : hx1 ] ) are characterized here by the partial spectral absorbtion coefficients @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the the photo - dissociation cross - section , and the absorption charge exchange processes ( [ eq : heh2 ] ) and ( [ eq : hx2 ] ) by the coefficients @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote the local plasma temperature and the densities of the atoms ( @xmath33 or @xmath34 ) , ions ( @xmath35 or @xmath13 ) and molecular ions ( @xmath10 or @xmath36 ) . assuming the existence of lte , we will take the photo - dissociation coefficient @xmath37 in an equivalent form ( suitable for further considerations ) , given by the relations @xmath38 @xmath39 where the photo - dissociation cross - section and the quantity @xmath40 are determined in a way similar to that in @xcite .    the efficiency of the processes ( [ eq : heh1 ] ) and ( [ eq : heh2 ] ) , and ( [ eq : hx1 ] ) and ( [ eq : hx2 ] ) together is characterized by the total spectral absorbtion coefficients @xmath41 @xmath42 where @xmath43 is given by eqs .",

    "the data needed for determination of @xmath44 and @xmath45 in the case @xmath10 are taken here from @xcite . for the molecular ions @xmath46 and @xmath47 the values of @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    "are obtained here , using the method of calculation described in details in @xcite .    as the main aim of this work is to draw attention to the processes ( [ eq : heh1 ] ) - ( [ eq : hx2 ] ) as factors of influence on the opacity of the stellar atmospheres in uv and vuv region , the spectral absorption coefficients ( for na , ni = 1 ) @xmath48 and @xmath49 , which characterize the total efficiency of the processes ( [ eq : heh1 ] ) and ( [ eq : heh2 ] ) , and ( [ eq : hx1 ] ) and ( [ eq : hx2 ] ) respectively , will be determined .",
    "the necessary calculations are performed here in accordance with ( [ eq : kapa24 ] ) - ( [ eq : kappaab ] ) in the part of the vuv region , namely @xmath50 , for several values of @xmath29 which are relevant for the photospheres of the sun and of the considered db white dwarfs .",
    "the behavior of the total spectral absorption coefficients @xmath48 for @xmath51 and @xmath52k and @xmath53k is shown in figs .  1 and 2 .",
    "the first temperature is characteristical of a large part of the solar photosphere , and the second - of a part of the atmosphere of db white dwarfs with @xmath54k .    the behavior of the total spectral absorption coefficients @xmath49 , in the case of the processes ( [ eq : hx1 ] ) and ( [ eq : hx2 ] ) with @xmath14 , for @xmath55 and @xmath56k , is shown in fig .",
    "let us note that the chosen temperature corresponds to a sunspot ( see @xcite )",
    ".    finally , taking into account the existence of the so - called lithium stars , intensively discussed in literature ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in fig .",
    "4 the behavior is shown of the total spectral absorption coefficients @xmath49 , in the case of the processes ( [ eq : hx1 ] ) and ( [ eq : hx2 ] ) with @xmath15 , for the same @xmath57 and @xmath29 as in the case @xmath14 .",
    "the presented figures illustrate the fact that the considered non - symmetric processes ( [ eq : heh1 ] ) - ( [ eq : hx2 ] ) generate rather wide molecular absorption bands in the vuv region .",
    "moreover , the comparison of @xmath48 and @xmath49 with the corresponding characteristics of other relevant absorption processes ( symmetric ion - atom absorption processes and etc . ) , as well as the corresponding particle densities , suggest a conclusion that in the regions of @xmath57 which correspond to the most parts of the mentioned bands the efficiency of the processes ( [ eq : heh1 ] ) - ( [ eq : hx2 ] ) is at least not negligible , and sometimes it is just these processes that determine the opacity of the considered stelar atmospheres ."
