    ", we will generalize these results by extending the study to the sample of 20 lensed quasars of mediavilla et al .",
    "( 2009 , hereafter med09 ) .",
    "our data consists of microlensing amplitude measurements for 29 image - pairs from 20 lensed quasars based on a comparison between the flux ratios in the continuum and an adjacent emission line .",
    "the emission line flux ratio provides an unmicrolensed baseline that also removes the effects of extinction ( see e.g. falco et al .",
    "1999 , muoz et al . 2004 ) and lens models in the determination of the magnification anomalies . as noted in previous works ( kochanek 2004 , eigenbrod et al .",
    "2008 , blackburne et al .",
    "2011a ) , studies favouring the selection of objects with noticeable magnification anomalies ( or epochs with high microlensing activity ) may lead to a bias towards smaller quasar size determinations .",
    "the fact that one object does not show microlensing magnification anomalies may be due to the fact that it is either too big or that it lies in a region without significant magnification fluctuations .",
    "thus , non - detection of microlensing also puts constraints on the size of the sources and should be taken into account . the med09 sample is also unaffected by this bias ( indeed the histogram of estimated microlensing magnifications in this sample peaks at @xmath8 ) .",
    "however , the data from med09 do not include , for most image - pairs , enough measurements at different wavelengths to address chromaticity .",
    "for this reason we will start discussing the impact of chromaticity on the determination of microlensing based sizes (  2 ) to show that size estimates are dominated by microlensing amplitude and are relatively independent of chromaticity . in ",
    "3 we will use the microlensing data from med09 to calculate a maximum likelihood estimate of the accretion disk size .",
    "the estimate will be for the typical size of the accretion disk of an _ average _ quasar rather than that of any particular source .",
    "we also make individual size estimates for the 19 objects using a complementary bayesian approach , finding excellent agreement with the likelihood analysis .",
    "the main conclusions are presented in  4 .",
    "we will base our analysis on the microlensing measurements inferred by med09 from optical spectroscopy available in the literature ( 29 quasar image pairs seen through 20 lens galaxies ) .",
    "the microlensing magnification between two images 1 and 2 is calculated as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the flux ratio in an emission line and @xmath11 is the flux ratio of the continuum adjacent to the emission line . with this method",
    "the microlensing magnification is isolated from extinction and from the mean lensing magnification , as these effects affect the line and the adjacent continuum equally .",
    "the consistency of this procedure has been confirmed with mid - ir data ( med09 ) .",
    "the histogram of observed microlensing magnifications in med09 showed that 93% of the quasar image pairs have microlensing @xmath12 . in this section",
    ", we are going to use this statistical constraint to estimate quasar accretion disk sizes from single wavelength microlensing measurements .",
    "we will apply a statistical approach similar to that used by @xcite to a representative lens system .",
    "therefore , we take for the lens a standard sis with values @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the convergence and shear at the positions of the two images .",
    "these values are typical of the lenses in the med09 ( cf . their table 4 ) .",
    "for the redshifts of lens and source we have taken the values @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which are the average values for the sample .",
    "using these parameters for the macro lens , we generate microlensing magnifications maps at the positions of images 1 and 2 using the inverse polygon mapping algorithm described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the calculated maps are @xmath17 pixels in size , with a pixel size of 0.5 light days , or equivalently @xmath18 cm . in the image plane ,",
    "the covered area is the source plane area increased by factors @xmath19 . for the fraction of projected mass density in stars , @xmath20",
    ", we use current estimates ( pooley et al . 2009 , med09 , mosquera et al .",
    "2011 ) and consider only the cases with @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we used microlenses of @xmath23 .    in order to describe the structure of the source , we model the accretion disk with a gaussian profile @xmath24 , where the characteristic size @xmath25 is a wavelength dependent parameter ( related to the half - light radius as @xmath26 )",
    "the wavelength dependence of the disk size is parametrized by a power law with exponent @xmath27 such that @xmath28 .",
    "we smooth the magnification maps with gaussians scaled to two wavelengths @xmath29 and @xmath30 representing characteristic blue and red wavelengths .",
    "we choose @xmath31 , the ratio between @xmath32 and mg ii , which is roughly the wavelength range covered by observations in the optical band .",
    "we calculate the probability of observing microlensing magnifications @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the magnifications at the positions of image 1 and 2 respectively ) at wavelengths @xmath29 and @xmath30 , namely , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , for a grid in the size at @xmath29 , @xmath38 , and the exponent @xmath27 .",
    "we use a logarithmic grid in @xmath25 such that @xmath39 for @xmath40 ( @xmath41 in light days ) and a linear grid in @xmath27 such that @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case @xmath44 , as we assume that the size of the source increases with wavelength , and therefore the largest magnifications are expected for the smallest ( i.e. bluest ) sources .",
    "the probability of observing @xmath45 and @xmath46 in a model with parameters @xmath41 and @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 here , @xmath50 is the number of trials with @xmath36 and @xmath37 for the case with parameters @xmath41 and @xmath47 , and @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the uncertainties in the observed microlensing magnifications , for which we have taken a typical value of @xmath530.05 mags .",
    "the calculations are performed for a grid of pairs @xmath54 with @xmath55 for @xmath56 and @xmath57 for @xmath58 ( so we always have @xmath59 and @xmath44 ) for @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "this range of values for the strength of microlensing covers the vast majority of observed cases as shown in the histogram of observed microlensing strengths in the sample of med09 ( their fig .",
    "thus , the probability distribution @xmath60 is calculated for @xmath61 cases .",
    "for each one of those cases ( i.e. for every quadruplet @xmath62 ) , the probability is calculated using @xmath63 trials .    the results for the case",
    "@xmath21 are shown in figure [ fig1 ] for @xmath64 .",
    "we have shown only the right side of the full figure , as the cases with @xmath65 are very similar to those with the same value of @xmath66 so that the scenario is fairly symmetric with respect to @xmath67 . for the case @xmath22 the results are very similar but the peaks in the probability distributions are displaced towards slightly higher values of @xmath25 .    with the exception of the cases in which @xmath68 ,",
    "the distributions show a clear covariance in the sense that larger sizes imply lower values of the exponent @xmath27 .",
    "we also see that larger values of @xmath36 favour smaller values for the source size @xmath25 .",
    "the most important result from this figure is that the probability distribution with respect to the size @xmath25 is dominated by the strength of microlensing ( @xmath36 ) with very little dependence on the amount of chromaticity .",
    "conversely , the value of the chromaticity ( @xmath69 ) is the main factor in determining the exponent @xmath27 .",
    "indeed , the most probable values of @xmath25 ( values within 1@xmath70 around the maximum of the distributions in figure [ fig1 ] ) remain roughly constant along each column in figure [ fig1 ] as we move through the different rows .",
    "that means that even if we lack information on chromaticity , we can still obtain valuable information on the size of the sources from measurements of microlensing at a single wavelength .",
    "another interesting and robust result from figure [ fig1 ] is that , with the exception of the case with no detected microlensing ( @xmath67 ) , the maximums of the distributions are all located in a fairly restricted range in @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , microlensing magnifications in the range @xmath71 will provide sizes in a rather restricted range between @xmath72 and @xmath73 light days irrespective of chromaticity , with larger magnifications favouring smaller sizes .",
    "based on the results of the previous section , it is possible to constrain the size of the sources from measurements of the microlensing strength at a single wavelength , even if we have no information on the amount of chromaticity present . as noted above",
    "( see also kochanek 2004 , eigenbrod et al .",
    "2008 , blackburne et al .",
    "2011a ) , each single microlensing measurement is affected by a degeneracy between the range of possible magnifications and source size effects .",
    "statistics of large samples of lensed quasars ( like med09 ) can be used to minimize this uncertainty . in particular",
    ", we are going to use a maximum likelihood method to estimate an average size from the product of the individual likelihood functions for each image pair .",
    "this method includes the cases with little or no microlensing that by themselves would give rise only to lower limits on the size on an equal footing with those showing significant microlensing .",
    "the microlensing magnifications in this sample have been calculated using the continuum to line flux ratios of different lines for different objects . as size is related to wavelength , we should ideally use objects with magnifications obtained from lines at similar wavelengths . on the other hand , to have good statistics , we should also try to keep the sample as large as possible . with these restrictions in mind , we have chosen a compromise in which we used all objects with magnifications measured in the wavelength range between ly@xmath20 ( 1216 ) to mg ii ( 2798 ) . with this choice , the average rest wavelength is in the relatively narrow range of @xmath74 , while we still keep 27 image pairs from 19 lensed quasars .",
    "the dispersion introduced by the effect of wavelength in the size estimate will be taken into account later .",
    "we then use the measured microlensing magnifications in these 27 pairs as observed @xmath36 ( where @xmath75 stands now for the average wavelength @xmath76 ) .",
    "we computed magnification maps for each one of the images of the 27 pairs individually taking the @xmath77 and @xmath78 values from med09 ( except for sbs0909 + 532 for which we take the values in mediavilla et al .",
    "we again consider only @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the calculated maps are @xmath17 pixels in size , with a pixel size of 0.5 light - days .",
    "we have used the same logarithmic grid in @xmath25 from  2 , as well as a linear grid @xmath79 light days for @xmath80 . using the magnification maps ,",
    "the probability of observing a microlensing magnification @xmath81 in image pair @xmath82 for a model with parameter @xmath83 is given by : @xmath84 where @xmath85    we can calculate a likelihood function for @xmath25 as @xmath86 where @xmath82 runs over the 27 image - pairs considered .    the results of this procedure for @xmath21 and @xmath22 are shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the maximum likelihood occurs for @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( @xmath25 in light days ) for @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "taking into account that @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the mean mass of the microlenses , our results for the mean size of the accretion disk of quasars are @xmath91 light days for @xmath21 and @xmath92 for @xmath22 .",
    "when scaled for a mean microlens mass of @xmath2 , representative of the stellar populations in galaxies , the sizes of the accretion disks become @xmath93 light days and @xmath94 light days for @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively , at our average wavelength @xmath95=1736 .",
    "the intrinsic dispersion in @xmath96 in between the sources implies an additional dispersion in @xmath25 of about 20% . when taking this effect into account in the error bars , we finally have @xmath97 and @xmath98 light days for @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .    using equation ( 3 ) and a bayesian approach with a logarithmic prior on @xmath25 ( see e.g. mediavilla et al .",
    "2011a ) , we also made individual estimates of @xmath25 for each one of the 19 quasars in our sample .",
    "for those objects for which there are several image pairs , the probability distributions for the different pairs were combined into a single probability function for that object .",
    "the resulting values for @xmath2 and @xmath21 are presented in table [ tab1 ] and in figure 3 .",
    "it is worth noting that the average value of these individual estimates ( @xmath99 light days ) is very close to the one obtained with the joint likelihood analysis ( although the use of a linear prior would increase the individual size estimates by 80% ) .",
    "note that the average size shrinks noticeably ( by @xmath100 ) if the pairs with @xmath101 are excluded from the sample .",
    "thus we confirm that favouring the selection of quasars with noticeable microlensing introduces a clear bias towards smaller sizes ( kochanek 2004 , eigenbrod et al .",
