    "in stochastic mass transport processes , one is generally concerned with the dynamics of abstract , usually indistinguishable particles .",
    "well known models include the totally asymmetric exclusion process ( tasep )  @xcite where the unidirectional free movement of particles is hindered by other particles , and the more generic zero - range process ( zrp )  @xcite that only models zero - ranged interactions of particles .",
    "depending on the situation and given type of dynamics these particles may represent actual molecules on the microscopic scale , mesoscopic objects like intracellular motor proteins  @xcite or even macroscopic bodies such as people or cars in traffic systems  @xcite .",
    "interesting effects such as phase transitions in the one - dimensional system and real - space condensation of particles can already be seen in the zrp , despite the absence of ranged interactions  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will consider a generalized transport process including short - ranged interactions which allows for a pair - factorized steady state ( pfss )  @xcite .",
    "for a specific type of interactions proposed by wacaw et  al.@xcite , this model features a spatially extended condensate that can assume several distinguished shapes .",
    "that is , by parametrization the condensate can be tuned to a single - site peak , rectangular or smooth parabolic envelope shape . here",
    "we will consider and validate predictions on the scaling of the condensate width as well as its shape made in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we will introduce the considered stochastic transport model and summarize the derivation of the predictions .",
    "the methods needed to simulate the model and measure its properties will be discussed in the third section followed by a discussion of our results in the fourth section .",
    "the paper closes with our conclusions in the fifth section .",
    "consider @xmath0 indistinguishable particles on a one - dimensional , periodic lattice with @xmath1 sites .",
    "any site @xmath2 can be occupied by any number of particles @xmath3 .",
    "we only consider closed systems , that is , the number of particles is conserved , @xmath4 , with an overall density @xmath5 .",
    "the dynamics is defined as a markovian stochastic process : at any time step , a particle may leave from a randomly selected site and move to either of its neighbours .",
    "the specific dynamics is largely controlled by the hopping rate @xmath6 , which determines whether a particle actually performs a hop .",
    "the fact , that it depends only on the occupation numbers of the selected site and those of its direct neighbours , reflects the short interaction range of particles and sites .",
    "the model can easily be tuned from symmetric to totally asymmetric dynamics by introducing a probability @xmath7 , that is used to decide whether a particle hops to the right or left neighbour .",
    "even though this allows tuning the process from equilibrium ( @xmath8 ) to non - equilibrium ( @xmath9 ) dynamics , the stationary state remains unaffected .",
    "such a model was proposed by evans et al .",
    "@xcite as an extension of the well known zrp and therefore inherits several of its properties : the model features a stationary state that may contain a particle condensate .",
    "the steady state probabilities @xmath10 factorize over symmetric non - negative weight functions @xmath11 of _ pairs _ of sites @xmath12 for @xmath13 kept constant , with the partition function @xmath14 and the configuration space @xmath15 .",
    "in contrast , for the zrp , the state probabilities factorize over _ single - site _ weight functions .",
    "if the weight function @xmath16 falls off faster than any power law , it has been shown that there exists a critical density @xmath17 , above which translational symmetry is broken and a particle condensate emerges  @xcite .",
    "that is , in the steady state the bulk system can only hold a limited number of particles given by @xmath18 and any further added particle increases only the condensate mass @xmath19 .    the hopping rate that leads to the steady state   is easily determined with the weight function @xmath11 as @xmath20 by resolving the balance condition in the steady state . in the case of symmetric",
    "hopping , detailed balance is fulfilled .",
    "an interesting way to construct such weights is to simplify and separate @xmath21 i.e. , to factorize @xmath11 into a zero - range part @xmath22 and a short - range interaction part @xmath23 that depends on the difference of nearest - neighbour occupation numbers .",
    "the term _ zero - range _ interaction refers to the fact that it allows a particle on a given site to interact with particles on the given site only .",
    "in contrast , _ short - range _ interactions act between particles of different sites . for example , the zero - range process  @xcite with the hopping rate @xmath24 is easily implemented using the weight function @xmath25 , with @xmath26 as there is no short - range interaction involved .    in the original model by evans",
    "et  al .",
    "@xcite governed by the weights @xmath27 the condensate has a characteristic smooth parabolic shape . under the conditions that @xmath28 falls off faster than any power law and @xmath29 for some @xmath30 , the exact envelope shape can be calculated as well as its fluctuations and the condensate width scaling behaviour @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "the factorization of @xmath11 also makes it easier to understand the physical picture of condensation involved .",
    "the zero - range potential @xmath22 gives a penalty to increasing occupation numbers , much like a potential energy term , while the short - range interaction @xmath28 tends to reduce the difference in occupation numbers of neighbouring sites , acting like a surface energy .",
    "it is then the respective relative importance of these terms that governs the properties of the emerging condensate .",
    "wacaw et  al .",
    "@xcite then suggested a family of weights @xmath32 that allows one to deliberately violate the asymptotic condition on @xmath22 for large @xmath33 by choice of parameters .",
    "this produces regimes featuring qualitatively different condensation properties , and most notably may be used to tune the condensates envelope shape as well as the scaling behaviour of its width with system size  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite these regimes and properties are derived in the large - volume limit of the model .",
    "it is the subject of this work to check these predictions by means of numerical simulations at finite volumes and scaling analyses . in the next subsection",
    "we will therefore shortly summarize the derivation of the interesting new properties .",
    "the proposed model is fully defined by eqs .  ,  , and  .",
    "the parameters @xmath34 give the respective growth behaviour of the short - range and zero - range interaction strengths and are expected to have the most influence on condensation properties .",
    "the factors @xmath35 allow to tune the relative strengths of the interactions but do not change the qualitative behaviour of the system as we will see later .",
    "in this paper we will therefore use @xmath36 .",
    "first , the condition @xmath37 is derived to observe condensation at all .",
    "next , the steady state weight eq .",
    "can be thought to factor into one part accounting for the statistical weight of the condensate and one for that of the rest of the system .",
    "then , a comparison of the weight of a single - site condensate @xmath38 and that of a condensate occupying two or more sites @xmath39 shows that for @xmath40 the weight @xmath39 grows faster than @xmath38 , so that an extended condensate can be expected in the large system - size limit .    in the case of the extended condensate",
    "a similar approach is used to predict some of its properties . under the assumption , that the contribution of fluctuation of occupation numbers is small compared to the contribution from the condensate itself ,",
    "the weight of a condensate extended over @xmath41 sites is given as  @xcite @xmath42 where for simplicity @xmath43 is treated as a positive constant to approximate the partition function , with an entropic term @xmath44 that corresponds to fluctuations of the occupation numbers and the largest eigenvalue @xmath45 of the associated transfer matrix .",
    "the expectation values @xmath46 correspond to values @xmath47 where @xmath48 with @xmath49 is the rescaled envelope shape of a condensate with height @xmath50 and width @xmath41 .",
    "now , for the expectation of occupation number differences @xmath51 a distinction into two cases is proposed to allow simplifications .",
    "either , the envelope shape @xmath48 is smooth or it is of rectangular shape . in the first case",
    "the expectation of the difference can be written using the derivative of the shape @xmath52 and the expectation reads @xmath53 . in the second",
    "suggested case , all differences are zero except at the condensate boundaries and the sum reduces to a single term . then in both cases , the sums can be written as integrals using the rescaled shapes resulting in @xmath54 , \\\\",

    "for @xmath57 , no solution exists for smooth condensates .",
    "finally these weights are compared to find @xmath58 for @xmath59 , showing that the rectangular shape is the stable one in this regime . in fig .",

    "the three regions of different scaling behaviour mark the distinctive phases . for @xmath68",

    "we will employ the empirical method of taking samples while evolving a markov process .",
    "once we have obtained a set of representative samples for one particular parametrization ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath69 ) , we can determine the condensate width .",
    "with the widths for different condensate volumes @xmath69 , we then can estimate the condensate - width scaling exponent @xmath70 .",
    "the straightforward method for generating samples is to simulate the process as defined .",
    "its dynamics with typically small transition probabilities leads to a large waiting time until the gathered samples are representative .",
    "the key ingredient for improving the simulation is that one knows the steady state probabilities ( [ eq : generalprobability ] ) which are invariant under the employed dynamics , asymmetric hopping ( @xmath9 ) in non - equilibrium or symmetric hopping ( @xmath8 ) in equilibrium . in the latter case",
    ", we can verify stationary equivalence to systems with other dynamics that yield the same distribution , but mix much more quickly .",
    "the metropolis dynamics is known to mix well and can be readily adjusted for the desired distribution , which is why we chose to use it in our simulations . when the update scheme is altered so that particles may hop to any site instead of just the nearest neighbours ,",
    "the simulation algorithm assumes the form :    1 .",
    "select randomly a site from which a move of one particle is attempted .",
    "if this site is empty , the system remains in the same state for another time step of @xmath71 sweeps .",
    "if it is occupied , choose any of the other sites as a destination site .",
    "3 .   accept the move with metropolis probability @xmath72 or remain at the current state for another time step otherwise , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the probabilities of the microstates before and after the proposed move , respectively .    for our implementation of the simulation we use the reference implementation of a variant of the mersenne twister pseudo - random number generator  @xcite .",
    "this approach works well for the smooth condensate shape region ( @xmath75 ) , where the probability landscape is marginally rugged . for systems in the rectangular condensate regime",
    "this is not the case anymore because the probability landscape is heavily rugged as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : shortestpath ] .",
    "the transitional states between rectangular condensates of different widths are suppressed by several orders of magnitude and simulations with single - particle ( or local ) updates mix slowly .    , @xmath76 .",
    "]    in order to address this issue , we designed an additional set of multi - particle ( non - local ) updates that allow jumps between high probability regions , which correspond to the peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig : shortestpath ] , in a single step , thus bypassing the suppressed transitional states .",
    "this is achieved by defining a condensate expansion and reduction transformation , where the condensate width is increased or decreased by about one unit .    with the above stated local update algorithm",
    "it is easy to verify that the resulting stationary distribution is given by eqs .  ,  ,  .",
    "by changing the dynamics we must be careful to keep the steady state unchanged .",
    "the local update performs well in exploring the landscape locally , which is why we will keep it and independently add non - local updates .",
    "the probability currents added by the new updates must cancel each other out at every state .",
    "this can be achieved by constructing a dynamics fulfilling detailed balance , where an incoming probability current is being canceled by its corresponding outgoing one .",
    "the one we used before and which we will use again is based on metropolis transition rates .",
    "the main problem here is to treat equally the two non - local update moves and how often to use them in order to minimize the relaxation time .",
    "we chose to solve this by restricting the number of new transitions that are permitted at any state to ( at most ) two ; an expansion and a corresponding reduction transition .",
    "the new simulation algorithm then consists of a preceding step , where a decision ( according to some predefined probability ) is made on whether to attempt a local or a non - local step . choosing a local update",
    "is followed by the algorithm above , while a non - local update is governed by the following algorithm :    1 .",
    "decide whether to attempt an expansion or reduction transformation with equal probability .",
    "if the chosen transformation is not valid , the system remains at the current state for another time step ( the system is constrained in a similar way to the situation of attempting to move a particle from an unoccupied site ) , otherwise continue .",
    "accept the transformation with metropolis probability @xmath77 or remain at the current state for another time step otherwise .        from the algorithm above",
    ", the necessary conditions are that there should be only one way ( if any ) to expand or reduce the condensate and the transformation must be invertible such that reducing a previously expanded state always results in the original state .    the conditions we decided on is that expansion transformations are eligible only if the original state has two unoccupied sites to the right of the condensate .",
    "one removes particles from the top of the condensate by sweeping from left to right and puts them on the empty site right to the condensate , until the two last condensate sites have the same occupation numbers ( in some cases this is not possible , then the transformation is invalid ) .",
    "likewise , reduction transformations are only valid if the original state has the same occupation numbers at the two rightmost condensate sites .",
    "one removes the particles at the rightmost condensate site and distributes them by sweeping from left to right onto the rest of the condensate .",
    "figure  [ fig : transformation loop ] gives an example of both transformations .",
    "for @xmath78 particles with @xmath79 and @xmath76 the autocorrelation time of the condensate width of purely local updates is about 10 times larger than that of non - local updates .",
    "increasing the particle volume by 50% ( 100% ) increases this factor to 50 ( 250 ) .",
    "whereas the new method enables systems with more than @xmath80 particles to mix sufficiently in less than an hour , purely local updates are constrained to less than @xmath81 particles .    in cases where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are both close to @xmath82 ,",
    "the critical density is so large , that the condensate is not surrounded by unoccupied sites anymore .",

    "the width of the condensate is defined as the distance between the two outmost sites of the condensate , which we will call the condensate extension @xmath41 ( see fig .  [",
