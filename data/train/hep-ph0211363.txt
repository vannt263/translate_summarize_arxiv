    "high gluon density effects at high energy ( small @xmath1 ) have been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental investigation @xcite . at small @xmath1 ,",
    "the number of gluons per unit area and rapidity in the wave function of a high energy hadron or nucleus becomes large and the high energy hadron or nucleus can be described by a classical color field .",
    "since most of the gluons in the wave function of a high energy hadron or nucleus are in a coherent state characterized by their typical momentum @xmath2 , a high energy hadron or nucleus is dubbed a color glass condensate . an effective action and",
    "renormalization group approach has been developed which enables one to calculate cross sections in a high gluon density environment .    in @xcite , for proton - nucleus collisions at high energies and in the forward rapidity region we proposed describing the proton by the qcd parton model and the nucleus by the color glass condensate model .",
    "one can then relate particle production in proton - nucleus collisions to the scattering of a quark or gluon from the color glass condensate @xcite . here",
    "we show that one can relate particle production in proton - nucleus collisions to deep inelastic scattering of electrons ( or more precisely , virtual photons ) on protons and nuclei .",
    "this is due to the fact that the description of the target as a color glass condensate is universal and independent of the process considered .",
    "while the relation between particle production in proton - nucleus collisions and dis structure functions has been known for a while in the case of dilepton ( virtual photon ) production @xcite ( and references therein ) , here we show that this relation is more general in our framework and holds for production of any particle ( which has a known fragmentation function ) in proton - nucleus collisions at high energy .",
    "this is crucial in view of the upcoming proton ( deuteron)-nucleus experiments at rhic .",
    "one would like to have predictions from qcd with as few model dependent assumptions about nuclear effects as possible .    in proton - proton collisions ,",
    "standard calculations are based on collinear factorization theorems , proven at the leading twist level .",
    "the predictability of the theory is due to the fact that the building blocks ( distribution or fragmentation functions ) used in the cross section are universal ( i.e. process independent ) objects which can be measured in a given process and used to predict the outcome of other processes .",
    "it is well known that higher twist effects break collinear factorization and one has to resort to other methods . in proton - nucleus collisions , in order to take nuclear modifications such as shadowing and cronin effect into account , one commonly modifies the parton distributions to include nuclear shadowing and introduces some model for cronin effect .",
    "the parameters of the model are then constrained by fits to the existing data and used to make predictions for other processes or higher energies .",
    "however , it is clear that this approach can not be true in general since collinear factorization theorems break down due to higher twist ( multiple scatterings ) effects which become significant in scattering off nuclei .",
    "therefore there is no guarantee that the parameters of such models are universal and process independent and these models have little predictive power .",
    "here we show that one can generalize the standard leading twist expressions in such a way that all higher twist effects are included and the universality of the building blocks ( dipole cross sections ) of the theory is preserved and the predictive power of the theory is restored .",

    "the main simplification compared to eq .",

    "( [ eq : bgbk ] ) in ( [ eq : discross - section ] ) gives the cross section for the interaction of a virtual photon with a proton target described by the color glass condensate .",
    "since we are interested in scattering off a nucleus target , we can replace @xmath93 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bgbk ] ) by @xmath94 .",
    "the parameter @xmath81 must also be scaled according to the transverse area of the target .",
    "the goal of the rest of this paper is to show that once one knows the dipole cross - section , there are several other interesting processes for which one can make quantitative predictions , since they can be expressed in terms of the same dipole cross - section .",
    "for instance , the cross section for jet production in @xmath80 collisions is very closely related to the dipole cross - section on a nucleus , as we will see in section [ sec : pa ] .",
    "the first example we consider is the production of virtual photons ( or , equivalently , lepton pairs ) in pa collisions , since this is in fact the process which is the most closely related to dis .",
    "we follow here the description of the proton assumed in @xcite , where it was assumed that the proton can be described in terms of standard parton distributions . therefore , the relevant subprocess for the production of a virtual photon in pa is @xmath95 , which is related to @xmath96 by a crossing symmetry .",
    "the main difference in the case of @xmath97 production is the fact that there are only two diagrams , represented in figure [ fig : gamma - prod ] .",

    "this has been noted independently by s.  peign in @xcite , where drell - yan and dis are compared up to the terms involving three scatterings on the target . in the present case ,",
    "this violation is in fact due to the eikonal approximation .",
    "indeed , this approximation being valid for an asymptotically large relative momentum between the projectile and the target , it does not allow to reverse continuously the momentum of the projectile .",
    "the photon production cross - section is obtained from the amplitude by @xmath108 where the factor @xmath109 is for the average over the color and spin of the incoming quark . at this point",
    ", it is useful to replace the integration variable @xmath28 by @xmath110 both in the amplitude and in its complex conjugate , in order to exploit the momentum dependence of the function @xmath33 .",

    "in this section we show how one can relate the cross section for forward particle production in pa collisions to the dipole cross - section . to be specific , we will consider pions but this can be repeated for any particle for which there is a known fragmentation function .",

    "@xmath181 where @xmath182 is the distribution function of quarks with fractional momentum @xmath183 inside a proton and @xmath184 is the fragmentation function of a quark into a pion carrying fraction @xmath48 of its energy . using ( [ eq : qacs ] ) in ( [ eq",
    ": fac ] ) we get @xmath185 where we have used the following kinematical relations @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 ( @xmath189 is the center of mass energy for a _ proton - nucleon subsystem _ ) .",
    "this way one can relate production of pions , kaons , protons , neutrons , photons and dileptons in proton - nucleus collisions in the forward rapidity region to the structure functions measured in dis . for this approach to be self - consistent , one needs to make sure that the dominant contribution to ( [ eq : csrap ] ) comes from the small @xmath1 ( @xmath190 ) region .",
    "our preliminary result seem to indicate that this is indeed the case .",
    "a detailed numerical study of particle production in proton - nucleus collisions at rhic is currently underway and will be reported elsewhere .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that in a classical description of the gluon content of the nucleus , there are many interesting physical quantities that can be related to the dipole cross - section ( or , at a more formal level , to the correlator @xmath191 of two wilson lines ) .",
    "this was already known for deep inelastic scattering and for the drell - yan process when one considers cross - sections integrated over the phase - space of the final state . in this paper , we establish also a similar correspondence for forward particle production in proton nucleus collisions , this time for the differential cross - section .",
    "more precisely , we show that the @xmath146 spectrum of the produced particles is related to the fourier transform of the dipole cross - section .    at a more formal level , we have generalized the standard leading twist collinear factorization approach to calculation of hadronic cross sections by showing that there is a universal object , the quark antiquark dipole cross section , which appears in all particle production cross sections in high energy proton - nucleus collisions .",
    "this dipole cross section plays the role of leading twist parton distributions in an all twist environment . in principle , it can be measured in dis or for example , in single inclusive pion production in high energy proton - nucleus collisions .",
    "once it is measured in a given process , it can be used to predict cross sections for other processes such as single inclusive hadron , jet , photon or dilepton production in high energy proton - nucleus collisions .",
    "this result could therefore be used in order to make predictions for pa collisions , or to further constrain ( or to rule out ) the dipole model with proton - nucleus experiments .",
    "the detailed numerical study needed in order to make quantitative statements is in progress and will be presented in a future work @xcite .",
    "however , a preliminary investigation of the fourier transform of the dipole cross - section in the model of @xcite seem to lead to a negative @xmath134 differential cross - section for some values of @xmath1 at large @xmath146 .",
    "this suggests that the small @xmath169 improvement of the dipole cross - section made in @xcite over @xcite is still not quite able to ensure that the results of perturbative qcd are recovered at large transverse momentum .",
