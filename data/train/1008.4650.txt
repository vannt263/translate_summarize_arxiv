    "the role of magnetic fields near strongly gravitating objects has been subject of many investigations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "they are relevant for accretion disks that may be embedded in large - scale magnetic fields , for example when the accretion flow penetrates close to a neutron star @xcite . outside the main body of the accretion disk , i.e.  above and below the equatorial plane , the accreted material forms a highly diluted environment , a ` corona ' , where the density of matter is low and the mean free path of particles is large in comparison with the characteristic length - scale , i.e.  the gravitational radius of the central body , @xmath0 km , where @xmath1 is the central mass .",
    "the origin of the coronal flows and the relevant processes governing their structure are still unclear . in this context",
    "we discuss motion of electrically charged particles outside the equatorial plane .    off - equatorial , energetically bound motion of charged particles in strong gravitational and electromagnetic fields is pertinent to the description of accretion disk coronae around black holes and compact ( neutron ) stars . in our previous papers",
    "@xcite we discussed the existence of energetically - bound stable orbits of charged particles occurring outside the equatorial plane , extending thus a large variety of complementary studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* and further references cited therein ) . particles on off - equatorial stable trajectories form a coronal flow that is possible at certain radii and for certain combinations of the model parameters , namely , the specific charge of the particles , the conserved energy and the angular momentum of the particle motion , the strength and orientation of the magnetic field , and the spin of the central body .",
    "we assume that the magnetic field permeating the corona has a large - scale ( ordered ) component @xcite . in this case",
    ", charged particles can be trapped in toroidal regions , extending symmetrically above and below the equatorial plane and forming two halo lobes .",
    "however , this trapping happens only for certain combinations of model parameters @xcite .",
    "we consider two types of the model setup : a rotating ( kerr ) black hole in an asymptotically uniform magnetic field parallel to the symmetry axis @xcite , and a non - rotating star ( described by the schwarzschild metric ) endowed with a rotating magnetic dipole field @xcite .",
    "both cases can be regarded as integrable systems with the electromagnetic field acting as a perturbation .",
    "the above - mentioned lobes are defined by the figures of the effective potential in the poloidal plane .",
    "these were previously studied in the context of charge separation that is expected to occur in pulsar magnetospheres ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ", we address whether the trajectories within these lobes are regular ( i.e. , whether the system is integrable ) , or if they instead exhibit a chaotic behavior .",
    "a related problem was studied recently by @xcite in an attempt to find a connection between chaoticness of the motion and the spin of a rotating black hole residing in the center .",
    "these authors suggest that chaotic behavior occurs for certain values of the black hole spin , while for others the system is indeed regular .",
    "the idea of investigating the connection between the spin of a black hole and chaoticness of motion of matter near its horizon is very interesting for the following reason . because of high degree of symmetry of the background spacetime , the unperturbed motion is regular @xcite ; no chaos is present .",
    "the electromagnetic perturbation may trigger the chaos , however , its effect can be expected to diminish very near the horizon , where strong gravity of the black hole should prevail .",
    "this is also the region where the spin effects are most prominent .",
    "further out various other influences become important due to distant matter and the turbulence in accreted material .",
    "therefore the connection between the spin and the motion chaoticness is best applicable in the immediate vicinity of the black hole , i.e.  within the inner parts of corona .",
    "the recurrence analysis @xcite provides us with a powerful tool for the investigation of complex dynamical systems .",
    "the method examines the recurrences of the system to the vicinity of previously reached phase space points .",
    "it has been typically adopted to study the experimental data , where often only some ( if not just one ) of the phase space variables are known from the measurements .",
    "takens embedding theorems @xcite are then used to reconstruct the phase space portrait of such a system . in our study",
    "we are equipped with the full phase space trajectory from the numerical integration of the equations of motion , so that we can use the recurrence analysis directly .",
    "it appears that the method of recurrence plots has not been employed in the context of relativistic astrophysical systems yet . to this end",
    ", one needs a consistent definition of the neighborhood of a point in the phase space in a curved spacetime .",
    "below , we discuss the phase space distance and suggest a form of the distance norm suitable in such circumstances .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "the two approaches allow us to show the onset of chaos in different , complementary ways .",
    "we examine the motion in off - equatorial lobes , pay special attention to the spin dependence of the stability of motion , and we notice the emergence of ` potential valleys ' that allow the particles to escape from the equatorial plane along a narrow collimated corridor .",

    "[ concl ] .",
    "the phase space trajectories of integrable systems are regular , meaning that they are bound to the surface of an @xmath2-dimensional torus , where @xmath2 is the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the torus is determined uniquely by @xmath2 constants of motion that are present in such a system .",
    "its behavior can be explored by poincar surfaces of section , which are defined by intersections of the phase space trajectory with a @xmath3-dimensional plane @xcite . on the other hand , non - integrable chaotic systems generally have fewer integrals than the number of degrees of freedom . in general , both the regular and the chaotic orbits may coexist in the phase space of a single system .",
    "chaotic orbits are ergodic on the given hypersurface .",
    "its dimension is now larger than @xmath2 , and the section points thus fill areas in the plot of the poincar surface .",
    "however , depending on the initial conditions , regular orbits can also appear in non - integrable systems .",
    "such orbits maintain the value of some additional constant of motion , although it is not generally possible to write this constant in an explicit form . in the context of motion around black holes perturbed by ( weak ) external sources , various aspects of chaos",
    "were studied e.g.  by @xcite , and very recently by @xcite .",
    "a standard approach to an integrable system with a non - integrable perturbation assumes complete control over the strength of the perturbation ( i.e. , the perturbation can be set to be arbitrarily weak ) .",
    "if this were the case , we could first switch the perturbation completely off , analyze the orbits , and then observe the impact of gradually increasing the perturbation strength upon these orbits .",
    "however , the class of off - equatorial bound orbits only exists when the electromagnetic term is strong enough to balance the gravitational attraction of the central body .",
    "then the ( sufficiently strong ) perturbation is by itself the cause of the new kind of the regular motion that happens outside the equatorial plane .    having this delicacy on mind",
    ", we shall use the usual hamiltonian formalism to express equations of motion governing the trajectories .",
    "we first construct the super - hamiltonian @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the rest mass and charge of the test particle , @xmath8 is the generalized ( canonical ) momentum , @xmath9 is the metric tensor , and @xmath10 denotes the vector potential of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the latter is related to the electromagnetic tensor @xmath11 by @xmath12 .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we will use geometrical units , @xmath13 .",
    "the hamiltonian equations are given as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the affine parameter , @xmath16 denotes the proper time , and @xmath17 is the standard kinematical four - momentum for which the first equation reads @xmath18 .    in the case of stationary and axially - symmetric systems",
    ", we identify two constants of motion , namely , the energy @xmath19 and angular momentum @xmath20 . from the second hamiltonian equation ( [ eq : ham ] ) we obtain @xmath21",
    "the trajectory is specified by the integrals of motion @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and the initial values @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . the initial @xmath25 can be calculated from the normalization condition , @xmath26 ( we always choose the non - negative root ) .",
    "the effective potential can be derived in the following form : @xmath27 where @xmath28,\\\\ \\gamma&=&-g^{\\phi\\phi}(\\tilde{l}-\\tilde{q}a_{\\phi})^2-g^{tt}\\tilde{q}^2a_t^2\\\\ & & + 2g^{t\\phi}\\tilde{q}a_t(\\tilde{l}-\\tilde{q}a_{\\phi})-1\\nonumber,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and where we introduce specific quantities @xmath29 , @xmath30 and the specific charge @xmath31 .",
    "local minima of @xmath32 reflect the location of stable orbits of test particles .",
    "off - equatorial potential minima were identified and various types of potential lobes were discussed elsewhere ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we can express the effective potential ( [ effpot ] ) as a function of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and use it to determine the boundaries of allowed regions in poincar surfaces of section for a given value of @xmath35 .",
    "we employ the kerr metric in standard boyer - lindquist coordinates @xmath36 , @xmath33 , @xmath35 , @xmath37 @xcite : @xmath38 ^ 2+\\frac{\\sigma}{\\delta}\\,{\\rm d}r^2+\\sigma\\ , { \\rm d}\\theta^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 stands for the spin parameter ( the specific angular momentum , @xmath40 ) , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "it is sufficient to consider positive values of @xmath39 without loss of generality ( the cases of prograde and retrograde motion are distinguished by the sign of the particle charge and the orientation of the magnetic field ) . by setting @xmath43 the metric reduces to the static one of the schwarzschild spacetime .          at this point ,",
    "a note is worth on the adopted computational scheme which we have employed to study the trajectories and to detect the chaotical behavior . in order to reach reliable results , we coded several approaches and we checked their stability and precision .",
    "we employ the multi - step adams - bashforth - moulton solver to determine the phase - space trajectory by numerical integration of eqs .",
    "( [ hamiltonsequations ] ) . in some cases ,",
    "when a higher precision is demanded , we use the @xmath44-@xmath45th order dormand - prince method that belongs to the family of explicit runge - kutta solvers with adaptive stepsize .",
    "this method improves the accuracy significantly , as can be verified by checking the conservation of the integrals of motion along the trajectory .",
    "however , the improved accuracy comes at the expense of computational time , as the adopted dormand - prince scheme is more computationally demanding than the adams - bashforth - moulton solver .",
    "furthermore , it is well - know that , when dealing with hamiltonian systems , the most appropriate solvers are those which respect the symplectic nature of hamiltonian dynamics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore employed also the implicit gauss - legendre runge - kutta ( glrk ) method , which is a symplectic scheme .",
    "indeed , we confirm that this code provides the most reliable results , especially in the case of long - term integration .",
    "the difference in the accuracy between glrk and non - symplectic solvers reaches several orders of magnitude and it is generally more apparent in the case of chaotic trajectories , as expected .",
    "however , the cost in terms of the computational time is also non - negligible , and so we only use the glrk method to achieve very accurate long - time determination of the trajectory in several exemplary runs .",
    "the kerr metric is well - known and the analysis of test particle motion in this spacetime was carried out in many papers @xcite . among important features of the kerr metric",
    "is the fact that the particle trajectories are integrable , and so the chaos can set in only when perturbations of the background gravitational field are introduced or additional electromagnetic interaction with fields of external sources are allowed . this is also where recurrence analysis can be helpful .",
    "methods of phase space recurrences have been successfully applied to a wide range of various empirical data , not only in physics but also related to physiology , geology , finances and other fields .",
    "recurrence plots are especially suitable for the investigation of rather short and nonstationary data . on the other hand ,",
    "the method of recurrence analysis has not yet been widely applied to study the dynamical properties of motion in relativistic systems .",
    "we thus briefly summarize this approach for our context .",
    "besides more traditional methods of the numerical analysis of dynamical systems , such as a visual survey of poincar surfaces of section or the evaluation of the lyapunov spectra @xcite , the recurrence analysis is a rather novel technique , based on the analysis of recurrences of the system into the vicinity of its previous states .",
    "recurrence plots ( rp ) are introduced as a tool of visualizing the recurrences of a trajectory in the phase space @xcite .",
    "the method is based on examination of the binary values that are constructed from the trajectory @xmath46 .",
    "results of the orbit analysis can be quantified statistically in terms of the recurrence quantification analysis ( rqa ) .",
    "the rp construction is straightforward regardless of the dimension of the phase space .",
    "we only need to evaluate the binary values of the recurrence matrix @xmath47 , which can be formally expressed as follows : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a pre - defined threshold parameter , @xmath50 the heaviside step function , and @xmath51 specifies the sampling frequency .",
    "the sampling frequency is applied to the time segment of the trajectory @xmath46 under examination .",
    "there is , however , no unique prescription for the appropriate definition of the phase space norm @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ rpdef ] ) . we can consider a purely abstract vector space and apply one of the elementary norms @xmath53 , @xmath54 ( euclidean norm ) or @xmath55 ( maximum norm )",
    ". some aspects of the appropriate choice of the norm are deferred to appendix  [ appa ] .",
    "finally , we need to specify the value of the threshold parameter @xmath49 . to this end",
    "we follow the suggestion of @xcite and relate @xmath49 to the standard mean deviation , @xmath56 , of the given data set . setting @xmath57 is advantageous because the proportionality constant @xmath58 , once adjusted to obtain a properly filled recurrence plot , remains valid ( with only minor adjustments ) for all data sets of other trajectories .",
    "we therefore normalize the time series of each coordinate separately to zero mean and @xmath59 .",
    "the binary valued matrix @xmath47 represents the rp which we get by assigning a black dot where @xmath60 and leaving a white dot where @xmath61 .",
    "both axes represent a time segments over which the data set ( the phase space vector ) is being examined .",
    "rp is thus symmetric ; the main diagonal is always occupied by the line of identity ( loi ) .",
    "recurrence plots contain wealth of information about the dynamics of the system @xcite .",
    "different pieces of knowledge are encoded in large - scale and short - scale patterns @xcite . to decide",
    "if a particular trajectory is a regular or a chaotic one , the determining factor is the presence of diagonal structures in the rp .",
    "diagonal lines in the rp reflect the time segments of phase space trajectory during which the system evolution proceeds in a regular way .",
    "it captures the epoch when the trajectory proceeds almost parallel to its previous segment , i.e.  within the @xmath49-tube around that segment .",
    "hence , integrable systems exhibit themselves by diagonally oriented structures in their rp . on the other hand ,",
    "if the motion is chaotic the diagonal lines disappear and the diagonal features become shorter , as the trajectories tend to diverge quickly . as a result , more complicated structures appear in the rp .",
    "we stress that the interpretation of the rp is primarily intuitive .",
    "we refer to the review paper @xcite where the patterns appearing in the rp and their relation to the current dynamic regime are analyzed in detail .",
    "although basic conclusions may be inferred in general ( e.g. distinction between regular versus chaotic regime ) the fine structure of the rp depends heavily on the properties of a given dynamic system . in order to gain more insight into the way in which various dynamical regimes manifest themselves in our system we typically present rps accompanied by corresponding poincar surface of section throughout this paper",
    ".    visual behavior of rp and it s complexity is quantitatively reflected in rqa .",
    "the rqa evaluates statistical characteristics of the recurrence matrix @xmath47 .",
    "first of all , we define the recurrence rate ( @xmath62 ) as a density of points in rp , @xmath63 now we can turn our attention to diagonal segments in rp .",
    "their length draws distinction between regularity and chaos .",
    "the histogram @xmath64 records the number of diagonal lines of length @xmath65 .",
    "it is formally given as follows : @xmath66 this histogram defines the determinism factor ( @xmath67 ) , defined as a fraction of recurrence points , which form the diagonal lines of length at least @xmath68 to all recurrence points , @xmath69 the average length of diagonal lines @xmath20 ( where only lines of length at least @xmath68 count ) is @xmath70 and the corresponding divergence ( @xmath71 ) is defined as inverse of the length of the longest diagonal line @xmath72 , @xmath73 @xmath71 is in its very nature closely related to the divergent features of the phase space trajectory , and so it was originally @xcite claimed to be directly related to the largest positive lyapunov characteristic exponent @xmath74 . on the other hand ,",
    "theoretical considerations justify the use of @xmath71 as an estimator only for the lower limit of the sum of the positive lyapunov exponents @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a strong correlation between @xmath71 and @xmath74 arises in numerical experiments @xcite .",
    "the quantification measure @xmath75 is defined as the shannon entropy of the probability @xmath76 of finding a diagonal line of length @xmath65 in the recurrence plot , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a total number of diagonal lines : @xmath79 .",
    "analogous statistics may be performed for vertical as well as the horizontal segments ( rp is symmetric with respect to the main diagonal ) .",
    "these segments are generally connected with periods in which the system evolves during its laminar state . to this end , the histogram @xmath80 records the number of vertical lines of length @xmath81 and it can be constructed as follows : @xmath82    in analogy with the diagonal statistics histogram , @xmath80 is used to define the vertical rqa measures .",
    "laminarity ( @xmath83 ) is defined as a fraction of recurrence points that form vertical lines of length at least @xmath84 to all recurrence points , @xmath85 the trapping time ( @xmath86 ) is an average length of vertical lines , @xmath87 finally , the length of the longest vertical line ( @xmath88 ) can also be of some interest .",
    "rqa measures the crucial dependence of rp on the value of the threshold parameter , @xmath49 , which must be adjusted appropriately to a given data set .",
    "this lack of invariance is a drawback of both rps and rqa .",
    "nevertheless , it was shown @xcite that stable estimates of various dynamical invariants , such as the second order rnyi entropy and the correlation dimension , can be inferred if @xmath49 is kept within a reasonable range .",
    "since we shall use the standard rqa measures to compare the dynamics between test particles with different initial conditions , we have to eliminate the numerical effect of variances in the range of coordinate values spanned by these trajectories .",
    "we achieve this by fixing the value of @xmath49 .    after the brief set of preliminaries",
    "we are now prepared to proceed to the intended application of the recurrence analysis in the next section .",
    "large - scale magnetic fields are known to be present in cosmic conditions .",
    "they can exist around black holes , which do not support their own magnetic field but may be embedded in fields of distant sources . in the case of neutron stars , dipole - type magnetic fields of very high strength often arise .",
    "we concentrate on black holes in this section and defer the case of a magnetic star to sec.[sectionmagnetized ] .    by employing the uniform test field solution",
    "@xcite we incorporate a weak large - scale magnetic field near a rotating black hole .",
    "the vector potential can be expressed in terms of kerr metric coefficients ( [ kerrmetric ] ) as follows , @xmath89 where @xmath90 is magnetic intensity and @xmath91 stands for the test charge on the background of kerr metric .",
    "the terms containing @xmath91 can be identified with the components of the vector potential of kerr - newman solution ( although the test charge does not enter the metric itself ) .",
    "an example of an integrated trajectory is shown in fig .",
    "@xcite has shown that the black hole selectively accretes charges from its vicinity , until it becomes itself charged to the equilibrium value @xmath92    we remark that the particle charge @xmath93 appears always as a product with @xmath91 or @xmath94 in the formula ( [ effpot ] ) for the effective potential , as well as in equations of motion ( [ hamiltonsequations ] ) .",
    "therefore , the simultaneous alteration of @xmath93 , @xmath91 and @xmath94 values , preserving the products @xmath95 and @xmath96 , does not affect the particle dynamics .",
    "if we further assume that @xmath97 is maintained , we only need to specify the value of @xmath96 to uniquely determine a particular trajectory .",
    "however , since we do not restrict ourselves to the case @xmath98 we decide to always explicitely specify the values of @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "our previous analysis @xcite concludes that the off - equatorial bound orbits are allowed only for test particles obeying simultaneously the two conditions , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "three distinct types were found ( see fig .  [ wald_abc ] ) and we examined the dynamics of test particles in all of these types . the results for different types are comparable , and so we present here only the analysis of one of them , namely the type ia . while raising the energy level from the local minima of the symmetric halo orbits , we observe that the off - equatorial lobes grow and eventually merge with each other once the energy of the saddle point in the equatorial plane is reached",
    ".    the size of the lobes is controlled by the specific energy @xmath101 .",
    "employing the poincar surfaces of section and the recurrence plots we investigate how the regime of the particle motion changes with @xmath101 .",
    "this parameter appears as a suitable control parameter producing a sequence of bound trajectories while all other parameters ( and the initial position ) remain fixed .",
    "for the sake of comparison we first present the case of a fully integrable system of a charged test particle on the pure kerr - newman spacetime ( fig .",
    "[ rppoinc1 ] ) .",
    "the motion occurs in the potential lobe around the local minimum in the equatorial plane ; there are no halo orbits above the horizon in this case @xcite .",
    "figure [ rppoinc2 ] shows regular motion occurring in the off - equatorial lobe on the kerr background with wald test field . increasing the energy level ( while keeping all other parameters fixed ) above the value in the equatorial saddle point results in a transitional regime depicted in fig .",
    "[ rppoinc4 ] .",
    "the onset of chaotic features does not occur as a direct consequence of the lobe merging .",
    "we rather observe that the orbit bound in merged ( cross - equatorial ) lobe remains regular until the particle _ notices _ the possibility of crossing the equatorial plane which happens when its energy is increased sufficiently .",
    "once the motion becomes cross - equatorial , chaotic features appear . by increasing the energy",
    "even more we approach the critical value when the lobe opens and allows the particles to fall onto the horizon . for energies slightly below this limit",
    "we detect a fully chaotic regime of motion ( fig .",
    "[ rppoinc3 ] ) .",
    "figure [ unthresholded ] shows an alternative representation of the recurrence plots , where the distance to the nearest neighboring point along the phase space trajectory is encoded by different colors .",
    "again , by comparing the two panels one can clearly recognize how the diagonal structures disintegrate into scattered points as the chaos sets in .    from the survey of poincar surfaces of section and the recurrence plots",
    "we may only conclude that the transition from the regular to chaotic regime occurs somewhere close to the value @xmath102 . in order to localize this transition",
    "more precisely we evaluate rqa measures for 400 trajectories with the energy spread equidistantly over the interval @xmath103 . in figs .",
    "( [ rqa1 ] ) and ( [ rqa2 ] ) , we observe a sudden change of the behavior of the statistical measure at @xmath104 , reflecting a dramatic change of the particle dynamics .",
    "moreover , we know that the divergence @xmath71 is related to the lyapunov exponents , and in fig .  [ rqa1 ] we observe that it suddenly rises at @xmath104 , meaning that the trajectories become more divergent when",
    "this energy is reached .",
    "all of these indications combined lead to the conclusion that this energy level represents a critical value at which a transition from regular to chaotic regime occurs .",
    "we conclude that the energy of the particle @xmath101 acts as a governing factor determining the dynamic regime of motion .",
    "our survey across various initial conditions has shown that motion in potential wells of the type ia in a wald test field is generally regular .",
    "chaos appears well after the merging point of the lobes and close to the critical breaking energy .",
    "we have verified that all queried rqa measures , i.e.  not only those based on diagonal lines in rp , react to the transition from the regular to chaotic regime of motion , allowing us to localize precisely the transition .",
    "this was fully confirmed also in the other two types ( classes ib and ic of our typology in fig .",
    "[ wald_abc ] ) .",
    "+       much attention has been recently focused towards the problem of determining the black hole spin from the properties of motion of surrounding matter @xcite .",
    "the astrophysical motivation to address these issues arises from the fact that cosmic black holes are fully described by three parameters  mass , electric charge and spin . while the methods of mass determination have been widely discussed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the electric charge is considered to be negligible because of rapid neutralization of black holes via selective accretion . however , determining the spin is a much more challenging task : the spin is important , but its influence is apparent only _ very _ near the black hole horizon @xcite .",
    "one can raise a question of whether the value of spin parameter @xmath39 of the kerr black hole affects the dynamical regime of motion in the immediate neighborhood of the black hole .",
    "in other words , we ask if the spin parameter @xmath39 triggers or diminishes the chaoticness of the system . answering",
    "this question is not straightforward because by altering the spin across an interval of values ( @xmath105 ) we inevitably have to change some other variables of the system ; otherwise the different cases could not be directly compared . moreover ,",
    "the location and the very existence of the potential lobes is not automatically ensured over the whole range of spin because of strong @xmath106 dependence .",
    "we found that in order to keep the off - equatorial lobe at the initial position and the original size we need to increase the energy @xmath101 , roughly proportionally to the increment of @xmath39 .",
    "the effect of increasing @xmath39 exhibits itself by lifting the hyperplane of effective potential . to compensate for this effect we have to elevate the @xmath101-plane at which we cut the potential , so that we obtain ( roughly ) the original closed contour ( the potential lobe ) inside of which the motion is confined .",
    "it turns out that this can be achieved by linking both quantities linearly .",
    "first we compare the dynamics in the off - equatorial lobe in the range @xmath107 ( for @xmath108 the topology of the effective potential changes ) to which we linearly relate the energy range @xmath109 ( whilst other parameters are kept fixed as follows : @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 ) . by inspecting the poincar surfaces of section and performing the recurrence analysis for a large number of trajectories across the given range of @xmath39 and @xmath101 ( exemplary cases presented in fig .",
    "[ spin_diskuze ] ) we come to the conclusion that there is no overall trend that could suggest that @xmath39 is the unique driving agent affecting the regime of motion . all trajectories in our survey exhibit a regular behavior , which is also in agreement with the previous conclusion that the motion in off - equatorial potential lobes associated with the wald test field is generally regular .",
    "we also examined the dynamics of test particles launched from the equatorial plane whose trajectories occupy the potential lobe extending symmetrically above and below the equatorial plane .",
    "a given lobe maintains its size for spin values @xmath116 and the related interval of energy @xmath117 .",
    "a survey across the given range of spin ( energy ) values reveals for this class of trajectories both chaotic and regular regimes . in fig .",
    "[ spin_diskuze_eq ] we observe that for the lowest inspected spin , @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) , the regular motion dominates , although islands of chaotic behavior are also present . increasing the spin ( energy ) we observe that regular trajectories gradually diminish . for @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) some regular orbits still appear , but they are already dominated by chaotic trajectories . for higher spins the traces of regular motion further diminish .",
    "we present the extreme case @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) in fig .",
    "[ spin_diskuze_eq ] to illustrate this apparent chaotic takeover .",
    "[ cols= \" > , < \" , ]     we conclude that for the class of orbits originating in the equatorial plane , spin @xmath39 could possibly act as a destabilization factor which triggers the chaotic motion if enhanced sufficiently .",
    "however since the energy @xmath101 is increased simultaneously it is not possible to attribute the observed dependence to the spin _",
    "itself_. on the other hand we have already seen in the above - given discussion ( sec .",
    "[ wald_lobes ] ) that energy @xmath101 may _ itself _ act as a key factor determining the dynamic regime of motion .",
    "thus we suggest to attribute the observed triggering of the chaos to the increase of energy @xmath101 rather then spin @xmath39 .",
    "we remark that a similar problem concerning the spin dependence of the motion chaoticness was addressed recently by @xcite .",
    "authors of the quoted paper employ a dipole magnetic test field upon a kerr background and perform a study of test particle trajectories , concluding that increasing the value of the spin parameter stabilizes the motion in a given setup .",
    "unlike our case , the topology of the effective potential in their scenario allows the chosen potential lobe to be maintained at a given location and roughly the same size ( but not the same depth ) even if @xmath39 varies while @xmath101 is kept constant . however increasing the spin allows the authors to set gradually lower and lower energies , for which more regular trajectories are found .",
    "this is not at all surprising in perspective of our results , where the energy @xmath101 proved to play a key role in determining the stability of motion .",
    "although a direct comparison of presented surfaces of section differing only in @xmath39 value may suggest the spin dependence , there is no clear and unambiguous correlation .",
    "we thus suggest attributing the observed dependence primarily to the level of energy , which acted as a motion destabilizer also in our setup .",
    "in fact , even if a real trend with the spin is present , it is hard to disentangle it from a simultaneous change of @xmath101 .",
    "the question of the dependence of the dynamics upon the other parameters of the system ( @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath95 ) was also addressed during the analysis .",
    "it appeared that above mentioned difficulties accompanying the analysis of the spin dependence became even more serious in this case .",
    "namely , neither it was possible to maintain the given potential lobe for a reasonable range of values of selected parameter nor we were able to fix this problem by binding this parameter in some simple manner to some other parameter ( e.g. energy @xmath101 ) .",
    "in other words , none of these parameters itself may be regarded as a trigger for chaos .      besides off - equatorial lobes",
    ", the potential may form another remarkable structure  an endless potential valley of almost constant depth which runs parallely to the symmetry axis ( fig .",
    "[ valley ] ) .",
    "the poloidal orientation and asymptotical form of the valley are due to the fact that the wald test field does not vanish at spatial infinity and it approaches the uniform magnetic field parallel to the symmetry axis .",
    "the existence of such a potential corridor suggests that test particles with a particular range of parameter values could escape from the equatorial plane to large distance .",
    "we observe that a test particle in the potential valley can keep oscillating around the equatorial plane or it may escape from this plane completely , depending on its initial position in the phase space ( see the upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ osc_unik1 ] ) .",
    "we can examine the motion in the asymptotic region by rescaling the radial coordinate ( upper middle panel of fig .",
    "[ osc_unik1 ] ) . to achieve this , we use @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the position of the outer horizon of the black hole .",
    "the normalization condition allows one to express @xmath128 as a function of other phase space variables and parameters of the system .",
    "intuition suggests that , considering particles launched from the equatorial plane ( @xmath129 ) , the initial value @xmath25 is a governing parameter which decides whether the particle remains oscillating around @xmath130 or leaves it once forever .",
    "we can draw the isolines of selected @xmath128 values in the ( @xmath33 , @xmath34)-plane which we use as a surface of section ( @xmath131 ) for the inspection of the test particle dynamics .",
    "comparing acquired isolines for various values of @xmath128 with the empirically stated escape corridor of fig .  [ corridor ] leads to the conclusion that they never coincide perfectly , although the correlation is quite high . in other words",
    "there is no definite threshold value of @xmath25 which would determine whether a selected combination of @xmath22 , @xmath24 ( while other parameters are fixed ) lets the particle launched at equatorial plane leave or oscillate around the plane .    in fig .",
    "[ corridor ] we observe several qualitatively different types of possible particle dynamics .",
    "next to the effective potential contour we find closed and well - defined curves which represent the regular motion .",
    "going further inside we notice that fragmented curves are present .",
    "below them we find progressively more and more blurred patterns , which again signifies the onset of chaos .",
    "the inner parts of the potential lobe are occupied by the `` escape corridor '' where the particles can stream freely from the equatorial plane , as seen in fig .",
    "[ osc_unik1 ] .",
    "the trajectories represented by the closed curves in the surface of section differ profoundly from the disconnected curve orbits .",
    "the difference can be seen also in the direct projection onto the poloidal plane ( upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ osc_unik1 ] ) . while the trajectories of the first type gradually fill each particular compact region of given section , the latter forms bundles which curl through the projection plane resembling ribbons that bound regions which are never reached by the particle .     +      by employing the recurrence plots ( bottom panels of fig .

    "we confirm that the dynamics differs significantly in these distinct modes of motion .",
    "not surprisingly we obtain a typical regular pattern in the case of trajectory which forms a closed sharp curve in the surface of section ( bottom left panel of fig .",
    "[ osc_unik1 ] ) .",
    "a `` ribbon  like '' trajectory ( fragmented curve in fig .",
    "[ corridor ] ) results in an ordered checkerboard pattern ( bottom middle panel ) , which is known to be typical for periodic and quasi ",

    "we observe that a blurred curve trajectory exhibits slight chaotic behavior in its rp .",
    "the diagonal structures are partially disrupted and we notice that diagonal lines become bent as they approach the line of identity .",
    "authors of the recent paper @xcite observed patterns similar to our fragmented curves in poincar sections of phase space occupied by geodesic trajectories around slightly perturbed kerr spacetime described by manko - novikov metric .",
    "they assume that such fragments can be identified with the birkhoff islands anticipated by the poincar  birkhoff theorem . a  given chain of birkhoff islands ( i.e. the fragmented curve in the section ) originates from the resonant torus of an unperturbed system whose orbits have characteristic frequencies in a given rational ratio .",
    "the most prominent chains of islands should belong to the resonances characterized by simple integer ratios @xmath132 , @xmath133 etc .",
    "authors of the cited paper conclude that the presence of the birkhoff islands might be in principle detected ( at least in the context of gravitational radiation emitted by extreme mass ratio inspiraling sources ) which would prove the system to be perturbed .",
    "however , since the assumption of the weakness of the perturbation is generally not fulfilled in our case , we do not explicitely identify fragmented tori in the surfaces of section with the birkhoff chains .",
    "the class of escaping trajectories in the kerr background was recently discussed by @xcite .",

    "however it appears that the system is not as rich in its dynamical properties .",
    "the test particle trajectories share some similar features across different classes of the effective potential .",
    "therefore , we only present surveys of particle dynamics in three exemplary types : ia , iia and iiic ( fig .",
    "[ rotdip_abc ] ; see @xcite for the complete review ) .",
    "class ia lobes grow with energy increasing .",
    "once the level of the equatorial saddle point is reached , the lobes merge with each other across the equatorial plane .",
    "the single merged lobe eventually intersects the surface of the star if the energy level is increased sufficiently , letting the particle fall onto the surface .",
    "lobes of iia type also merge via the equatorial plane but in contrast to the first type the merged lobe opens toward the light cylinder ( beyond which the model becomes invalid ) .",
    "lobes of the class iiic first open via the off - equatorial saddle points , allowing the particles fall onto the star , before the lobes merge through the equatorial plane .",
    "now we study the three selected types of the effective potential topology in more detail .",
    "we are primarily interested whether and how the dynamic regime changes across the given range of specific energy @xmath101 .",
    "especially , we shall address what happens with the dynamics when the particle acquires enough energy to cross the saddle point .",
    "the first survey ( type ia ) begins at energy level @xmath151 , corresponding to the closed lobe . in fig .",
    "[ rotdip1_1p ] we observe that the motion inside the lobe is stable .",
    "no chaotic properties are detected  neither in poincar surfaces of section nor in the recurrence plots .    as the energy increases to @xmath152 , the symmetrical lobes merge via the equatorial plane . by inspecting a number of trajectories in this case",
    "we find that chaos starts appearing at this point ",
    "those particles which notice the gate through the equatorial plane always fill the entire allowed region and they move chaotically .",
    "nevertheless , there are still such particles which move regularly in one of the two parts of merged lobe and never cross the equatorial plane .",
    "we can also find transient trajectories corresponding to regular motion lasting for some period of time in one part of the lobe , followed by chaotic motion over the entire lobe once the particle finds and encounters the passage across the equatorial plane .",
    "all of the mentioned cases are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ rotdip1_2 ] .",
    "increasing the energy further to @xmath153 , we obtain a broad potential lobe which almost touches the star surface .",
    "the situation changes from the previous case where the gate connecting the off - equatorial lobes was narrow .",
    "now we do not find trajectories which occupy only one part of the lobe , above ( or below ) the equatorial plane .",
    "chaotic trajectories densely filling the entire lobe are typical for this setup .",
    "we also encounter perfectly regular trajectories forming ribbon  like structures spanned between northern and southern borders of the lobe . in poincar sections these appear as regular islands surrounded by a chaotic ocean ( upper panels of fig .",
    "[ rotdip1_3 ] ) .",
    "we notice that the rp of this regular trajectory is extraordinarily simple and consists of almost perfect diagonal lines ( bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ rotdip1_3 ] ) .",
    "thus its dynamic properties are close to those of a periodic system , which is in contrast with the neighboring fully chaotic orbits .",
    "the second type ( class iia ) of the effective potential topology of off - equatorial lobes differs from the first one significantly as the lobes do not open towards the star when the energy is raised sufficiently . on the contrary , in this case we observe that the lobe s boundary touches the light cylinder first .",
    "the motion in the off - equatorial lobes proves to be regular while the merging lobes bring chaos into play .",
    "chaos becomes dominant for broader lobes , however , stable regular orbits also persist .",
    "the results are similar to those of the first type of potential topology discussed above .",
    "the last analyzed topology of the lobes ( class iiic ) differs profoundly from the preceding two cases , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ rotdip_abc ] .",
    "we find that stable motion dominates in this setup .",
    "this can be verified by comparison with fig .",
    "[ rotdip3_1 ] .",
    "as we further increase the energy level , we obtain more complicated shapes of the equipotentials that allow the particle to fall on the star surface . on the other hand , opening the outflow gate energetically precedes the merging point of both off - equatorial lobes . in fig .",
    "[ rotdip3_3 ] , we discuss the motion governed by the largest possible lobe which almost touches the light cylinder . we observe that stable regular orbits are still possible for those particles that do not hit the passage .    from the above - given discussion",
    "we conclude that the motion of charged test particles in the off - equatorial lobes allowed by the test field of the rotating magnetic dipole on the schwarzschild background is largely regular .",
    "once the off - equatorial lobes merge with each other , chaos may appear . increasing the energy ,",
    "the chaotic motion becomes typical but , quite surprisingly , very stable orbits also exist under these circumstances .",
    "we studied the regular and chaotic motion of electrically charged particles near a magnetized rotating black hole or a compact star .",
    "we employed the method of recurrence analysis in the phase space , which allowed us to characterize the chaoticness of the system in a quantitative manner . unlike the method of poincar surfaces ,",
    "the recurrence plots have not yet been widely used to study the chaotic systems in the regime of strong gravity .",
    "the main motivation for these investigations is the question of whether the matter around magnetized compact objects can exhibit chaotic motion , or if instead the system is typically regular .",
    "one of the main applications of our considerations concerns the putative envelopes of charged particles enshrouding the central body in a form of a fall - back corona , or plasma coronae extending above the accretion disk . while we concentrated on the specifications of the rp method in circumstances of a relativistic system , the assumed model can not be considered as any kind of a realistic scheme for a genuine corona .",
    "we simply imposed a large - scale ordered magnetic field acting on particles in a combination with strong gravity .",
    "various aspects of charged particle motion were addressed throughout this paper .",
    "first of all , we investigated the motion in off - equatorial lobes above the horizon of a rotating black hole ( modeled by kerr metric equipped with the wald test field ) , as well as above the surface of a magnetic star ( modeled by the schwarzschild metric with the rotating dipolar magnetic field ) . in both cases",
    "we conclude that the motion of test particles is regular , which was confirmed for a representative number of orbits across the wide range of parameters over all topological types of off - equatorial potential wells .",
    "this result is somewhat unexpected because the off - equatorial orbits require a perturbation to be strong enough ( in terms of strength of the electromagnetic field ) , so that it can balance the vertical component of the gravitational force .",
    "+      further , we investigated the response of the particle dynamics when the energy level @xmath101 was raised gradually from the potential minimum to values allowing cross - equatorial motion .",
    "we examined various topological classes of the effective potential and came to the conclusion that the cross - equatorial orbits are typically chaotic , although very stable regular orbits may also persist for a certain intermediate energy range .",
    "the classical work of @xcite should be recalled in this context since it also identifies the energy as a trigger for chaotic motion in the analysed simple system .",
    "more recently the hnon  heiles system was revisited in the relativistic context by @xcite .",
    "we also addressed the question of spin dependence of the stability of motion for kerr black hole in the wald field .",
    "we noticed that this is a rather subtle problem .",
    "the effective potential is by itself sensitive to the spin value @xmath39  hence , we had to link the potential value roughly linearly with the energy @xmath101 to maintain the potential lobe at a given position .",
    "in other words , we did not find any clear and unique indication of the spin dependence of the motion chaoticness .",
    "most trajectories exhibited regular behavior , which is also in agreement with the previous results indicating that motion in off - equatorial lobes is generally regular .",
    "on the other hand , in the case of the cross - equatorial motion we observed that , for higher spins , more chaotic features come into play when compared with the case of slow rotation .",
    "this trend might be also attributed to simultaneous adjustments of @xmath101 . in other words",
    ", it appears impossible to give an unambiguous conclusion about the spin dependence of the particles dynamics .",
    "instead , one has to deal with a complex , interrelated dependence .    in the case of a kerr black hole immersed in a large - scale magnetic field ,",
    "we observed the effect of confinement of particles regularly oscillating around the equatorial plane . escape of particles from the plane is allowed for a given range of initial conditions since the equipotentials do not close ; they form an endless axial `` valley '' instead .",
    "the escaping trajectories create a narrow , collimated structure parallel to the axis .    asking the question about the dynamical properties of motion of matter in the black hole",
    "coronae is of theoretical interest by its own , but it is relevant also in view of precise spectroscopical and timing studies with the forthcoming x - ray satellites .",
    "however , one more word of caution is appropriate especially concerning our assumption of the ordered magnetic field .",
    "although the large - scale magnetic fields are adequate to describe the initial background field of the magnetic star or a toroidal current in the accretion disk ( * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) , a turbulent component is known to develop quickly in the accreted plasma @xcite .",
    "these will also perturb the motion of matter , and so the regular orbits may quickly disappear .",

    "while constructing the recurrence plots , we check whether the condition @xmath177 remains satisfied .",
    "the above - mentioned adoption of preferred observers is needed in order to maintain an operational criterion of chaos and be able to formulate an explicit form of the equations for rqa measures in a curved spacetime . here",
    "the notion of the phase space distance plays a role . in kerr metric ( or another axially symmetric stationary spacetime ) , fiducial observers ( a.k.a .",
    "fidos ) represent a natural selection of preferred observers . obviously , this option is not unique , and so a detailed appearance of the recurrence plots is also ambiguous to certain extent . but not so the main conclusions that we infer regarding the chaoticness versus regularity of the system behavior , because this distinction can be eventually traced down to the exponential versus polynomial growth of the separation with the particle proper time along neighboring trajectories .",
    "we can deduce the kind of transformation between different families of observers that could affect our conclusions : these are transformations involving exponential dependencies on observer s phase - space position .",
    "for example transformation to accelerated frames and spacetime points in the vicinity of singularities may need a special consideration , as well as the investigation of highly dynamical spacetimes that are lacking symmetries . on the other hand , selecting lnrf to define zamos in ( weakly perturbed ) kerr metric outside the black hole horizon appears to be a well - substantiated choice .",
    "similar arguments for the adoption of preferred observers on the basis of spacetime symmetries have been elaborated in greater detail by @xcite in the context of ernst s magnetized black hole , which is another particularly simple ( static ) exact solution of einstein - maxwell equations exhibiting the onset of chaos as the magnetic field strength is increased .",

    "<S> accretion onto black holes and compact stars brings material in a zone of strong gravitational and electromagnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> we study dynamical properties of motion of electrically charged particles forming a highly diluted medium ( a corona ) in the regime of strong gravity and large - scale ( ordered ) magnetic field .    </S>",
    "<S> we start our work from a system that allows regular motion , then we focus on the onset of chaos . to this end , we investigate the case of a rotating black hole immersed in a weak , asymptotically uniform magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider a magnetic star , approximated by the schwarzschild metric and a test magnetic field of a rotating dipole . </S>",
    "<S> these are two model examples of systems permitting energetically bound , off - equatorial motion of matter confined to the halo lobes that encircle the central body . </S>",
    "<S> our approach allows us to address the question of whether the spin parameter of the black hole plays any major role in determining the degree of the chaoticness .    to characterize the motion </S>",
    "<S> , we construct the recurrence plots ( rp ) and we compare them with poincar surfaces of section . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the recurrence plots in terms of the recurrence quantification analysis ( rqa ) , which allows us to identify the transition between different dynamical regimes . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that this new technique is able to detect the chaos onset very efficiently , and to provide its quantitative measure . </S>",
    "<S> the chaos typically occurs when the conserved energy is raised to a sufficiently high level that allows the particles to traverse the equatorial plane . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the role of the black - hole spin in setting the chaos is more complicated than initially thought . </S>"
