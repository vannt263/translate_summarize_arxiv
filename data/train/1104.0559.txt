    "tunneling is one of the most fundamental manifestations of quantum mechanics . for 1d systems the theoretical description",
    "is well established by the wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( wkb ) method and related approaches @xcite . however , for higher dimensional systems no such simple description exists . in these systems",
    "typically regular and chaotic motion coexists and in the two - dimensional case regular tori are absolute barriers to the motion .",
    "quantum mechanically , the eigenfunctions either concentrate within the regular islands or in the chaotic sea , as expected from the semiclassical eigenfunction hypothesis @xcite .",
    "these eigenfunctions are coupled by so - called dynamical tunneling @xcite through the dynamically generated barriers in phase space . in particular , this leads to a substantial enhancement of tunneling rates between phase - space regions of regular motion due to the presence of chaotic motion , which was termed chaos - assisted tunneling @xcite .",
    "such dynamical tunneling processes are ubiquitous in molecular physics and were realized with microwave cavities @xcite and cold atoms in periodically modulated optical lattices @xcite .    in the quantum regime , @xmath0 , where the effective planck constant @xmath1 is smaller but still comparable to the area of the regular island @xmath2 ,",
    "the process of tunneling into the chaotic region is dominated by a _ direct regular - to - chaotic tunneling _",
    "mechanism @xcite .",
    "for the prediction of tunneling rates the fictitious integrable system approach was introduced recently @xcite .",
    "it relies on a fictitious integrable system @xcite that resembles the regular dynamics within the island under consideration .",
    "the approach has been applied to quantum maps @xcite , billiard systems @xcite , and the annular microcavity @xcite . in the semiclassical regime , @xmath3 , however , the direct tunneling contribution alone is typically not sufficient to describe the observed tunneling rates , because nonlinear resonance chains within the regular island lead to resonance - assisted tunneling @xcite .",
    "recently , a combined prediction of dynamical tunneling rates from regular to chaotic phase - space regions was derived @xcite , which combines the direct regular - to - chaotic tunneling mechanism in the quantum regime with an improved resonance - assisted tunneling theory in the semiclassical regime . in this text",
    "we concentrate on the fictitious integrable system approach for the theoretical description of the direct regular - to - chaotic tunneling mechanism and how it can be applied analytically , semiclassically , and numerically to quantum maps .",
    "this text is organized as follows : we start by defining different convenient kicked systems , their quantization , and the numerical determination of tunneling rates . in sec .  [",

    "[ sec : ex ] we apply this theory to the previously introduced systems and compare its results with numerical data .",
    "we conclude with a brief summary .",
    "kicked systems are particularly suited to study classical and quantum effects appearing in a mixed phase space as they can be easily treated analytically and numerically .",
    "in contrast to time - independent systems , where at least two degrees of freedom are necessary to break integrability , one - dimensional driven systems can show chaotic motion .",
    "we consider time - periodic one - dimensional kicked systems @xmath4 which are described by the kinetic energy @xmath5 and the potential @xmath6 which is applied once per kick period @xmath7 .",
    "the classical dynamics of a kicked system is given by its stroboscopic mapping , e.g. , evaluated just after each kick @xmath8 it maps the phase - space coordinates after the @xmath9th kick to those after the @xmath10th kick . for the stroboscopic mapping",

    "classically , a particle within a regular island will never enter into the chaotic region and vice versa , i.e.  tori form absolute barriers to the motion .",
    "the paradigmatic model of an area preserving map is the standard map , defined by eq .   with the functions @xmath13 for @xmath14",

    "a hierarchical region exists , where self - similar structures of regular and chaotic dynamics are found on all scales .",
    "also in the chaotic sea additional structures can be found . here , partial barriers limit the classical flux between different regions of chaotic motion caused by the stable and unstable manifolds of unstable periodic orbits or caused by cantori , which are the remnants of regular tori @xcite . for even larger @xmath16",

    "all these structures in phase space , such as nonlinear resonances , the hierarchical regular - to - chaotic transition region , and partial barriers within the chaotic sea , have an influence on the dynamical tunneling process from the regular island to the chaotic sea . in order to quantitatively understand dynamical tunneling in systems with a mixed phase space ,",
    "it is helpful to first consider simpler model systems . by designing maps such that the phase - space structures can be switched on and off one - by - one it is possible to study their influence on the dynamical tunneling process separately .",
