    "in high - mass star forming regions , h@xmath0o masers are locally generated and pumped by the interaction of supersonic outflows from a central young stellar object ( yso ) with a clumpy medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . since h@xmath0o masers are bright and compact sources , they are one of the major targets for very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) with milliarcsecond ( mas ) angular resolution , being a powerful tool to know the structure and kinematics of the gas close to massive ysos .",
    "in fact , vlbi and long - term monitoring observations of h@xmath0o masers have provided basic physical information for star - forming regions producing maser emission , revealing , for example , the internal structure of clusters of masers , the variability of their flux densities , radial velocities , proper motions , structure of the magnetic field , and evolutionary stages of massive protostars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "w75n is a massive star - forming region located in the cygnus x complex of dense molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "the detection of h@xmath0o , oh , and ch@xmath5oh masers in the vicinity of the radio continuum sources vla  1 , vla  2 , and vla  3 indicates that they are massive ysos in their early stages of evolution , probably early b spectral types @xcite .",
    "these three sources are located within an area of @xmath1 1.5@xmath6@xmath71.5@xmath6 ( @xmath1 3000 au@xmath7[d/2  kpc ] ) , with vla  1 and vla  3 showing elongated radio continuum emission interpreted as arising from radio jets , and vla  2 showing compact unresolved continuum emission ( @xmath8 0.08@xmath6 ) at cm wavelengths with a still unknown nature ( torrelles et al .",

    "vlbi multi - epoch observations of h@xmath0o masers carried out with the very long baseline array ( vlba ) in 1999 show remarkable different geometry of outflow ejections in vla  1 and vla  2 , both objects separated by @xmath1 0.7@xmath6 ( 1400 au@xmath7[d/2  kpc ] ; torrelles et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter t03 ) .",
    "in fact , the h@xmath0o masers associated with vla  1 are distributed along a linear structure parallel to its radio jet , with mean proper motions of @xmath1 2  mas yr@xmath4 ( 19  km  s@xmath4@xmath7[d/2  kpc ] ) , tracing a collimated jet - like outflow at scales of @xmath1 1@xmath6 ( 2000 au@xmath7[d/2  kpc ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the masers associated with vla  2 display an almost circular shell - like structure of @xmath1 0.08@xmath6 radius ( 160 au@xmath7[d/2  kpc ] ) around the central compact radio continuum source , moving outward in multiple directions with a mean proper motion of @xmath1 3  mas yr@xmath4 ( 28  km  s@xmath4@xmath7[d/2  kpc ] ) and estimated kinematic age of 13 yr .",
    "t03 interpret this structure as a wind - driven shell from the central massive yso .",
    "this result was surprising since the current paradigm of star formation through accretion disks , ejecting gas via magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) mechanisms , does not predict outflows expanding without any preferential direction , but producing collimated outflows ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . on the basis of these vlba results ,",
    "t03 suggested that at the first stages of evolution of massive protostars there may exist short - lived events with very poorly collimated outflows .",
    "very recently , this has been theoretically proved by seifried et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , who performed mhd simulations of massive star formation by including both strong and weak magnetic fields .",
    "they found that at the earliest stage , in the case of a strong magnetic field , the outflows are poorly collimated for a short - lived period .",
    "in addition , since the motions of the shell - like structure in vla  2 are observed at a smaller scale than the collimated motions in the nearby vla  1 source , t03 suggested that vla  2 is in an earlier stage than vla  1 and could evolve in the future into a collimated jet - like structure .",
    "more recently , surcis et al . (",
    "2011 ; hereafter s11 ) compared the distribution of the masers around vla  2 observed in 1999 ( t03 ) and in a single - epoch of 2005 ( s11 ) and found an average expansion velocity for the shell - like structure of @xmath1 4.8  mas  yr@xmath4 ( @xmath9@xmath7[d/2  kpc ] ) in the time span of six years ( 1999@xmath102005 ) .",
    "in addition , these authors noted that there are preferential gas movements northeastward in the vla 2 shell , suggesting the formation of a jet .    in this paper , we present three epochs of vlbi observations of h@xmath0o masers in w75n carried out with the vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ( vera ) in 2007 .",

    "we utilized the dual - beam mode for by taking the galactic radio continuum source cygnus x-3 .",
    "however , since the microquasar cygnus x-3 is a transient source , we only detected fringes for the first and third epoch during its flaring states .",
    "as a result , it has not been possible to carry out the phase referencing technique for w75n .    in each of the three epochs , the total observation time was 8 hours .",
    "all vera stations had no systematic and technical problems .",
    "left - handed circular polarization was received and sampled with 2-bit quantization , and filtered using the vera digital filter unit @xcite .",
    "the data were recorded onto magnetic tapes at a rate of 1024 mbps , providing a total bandwidth of 256 mhz .",
    "we chose the vera 7 mode in which one intermediate frequency ( if ) was assigned to and the other 15 ifs were assigned to cygnus x-3 .",
    "the well - known , bright continuum source bl lac was observed every 70 minutes for the bandpass and delay calibrations . the system noise temperatures including atmospheric attenuation , sensitive to weather conditions and the elevation angle of the observed source , were measured with the chopper - wheel method @xcite .",
    "the aperture efficiencies of the antennas ranged from 45% to 52% , depending on each vera station ( see the vera status report ) .",
    "a variation of the aperture efficiency of each antenna as a function of the elevation angle was confirmed to be less than 10% at the lowest elevation in the observations around @xmath1 20@xmath14 .",
    "correlation processing was performed on the mitaka fx correlator @xcite located at the national astronomical observatory of japan ( naoj ) mitaka campus .",

    "therefore , the total velocity coverage is 107.5 @xmath16 , centered at the local standard of rest velocity v@xmath17 = 12.3  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "calibration and imaging were performed using the astronomical imaging processing system ( @xmath18 ) of the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) .",

    ", we obtained the complex gains that we applied to the rest of frequency channels to produce the phase and amplitude - calibrated synthesized images in each channel .",
    "the resulting synthesized beams were 1.2@xmath70.8 ( first epoch ) , 1.2@xmath70.9 ( second epoch ) , and 1.4@xmath70.9 ( third epoch ) in units of mas . to search for h@xmath0o maser emission ,",
    "a region of @xmath29 was examined including vla  1 , vla  2 , and vla  3 .",

    "the relatively higher rms value is due to high system temperatures of @xmath11,000 k and @xmath1800 k in the iriki and ishigaki stations , respectively . to identify the h@xmath0o masers",

    "preliminary alignment of the three epochs was made with respect to the reference maser spot used for self - calibrating the data . within this reference system",
    ", we measured the proper motions of three masers that persisted in all three epochs through a linear fitting of their positions , and of 37 masers that appeared in two different epochs . to consider the persisting masers we applied the criterion of having the same radial velocity ( @xmath31 ) in the different epochs and moving with proper motions within @xmath1 10 @xmath32 ( 100  km  s@xmath4@xmath7[d/2  kpc ] ) .",
    "however , the selected reference maser spot may have its own proper motion , introducing an arbitrary offset to the proper motions of all the masers . to minimize this effect , we subtracted the mean proper motion vector of all these 40 masers from the proper motion of each maser , making a realignment of the three epochs .",
    "the proper motion values of the 40 masers that we present in table 1 have been obtained after this realignment .",
    "we have detected two clusters of h@xmath0o masers , one associated with vla  1 and the other with vla  2 .",
    "no maser emission was detected toward vla  3 . in figure 2",
    ", we present the spatial distribution of the masers in vla  1 and vla  2 as observed with vera for three epochs in 2007 .",
    "globally , the maser distribution is similar to that previously reported with vlba in 1999 ( t03 ) and 2005 ( s11 ) .",
    "in fact , while the h@xmath0o masers in vla  1 are mainly distributed along a linear structure parallel to its radio jet , the masers in vla  2 are distributed in a shell - like structure surrounding the compact radio continuum source .",
    "the total h@xmath0o maser spots detected with vera are 31 , 106 , and 141 , with most of the masers belonging to vla  2 , 25/31(80 @xmath33 ) , 95/106 ( 90 @xmath33 ) and 92/144 ( 64 @xmath33 ) on 2007 january 20 , 2007 february 21 , and 2007 may 29 , respectively .",
    "the probable reason for the relatively small number of detected masers in the first epoch is the higher rms level in this set of data in comparison with the other two epochs ( see   2 ) . as a result ,",
    "the shell - like structure associated with vla 2 is not clearly seen in the first epoch ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the h@xmath0o maser emission in vla 1 spans a radial velocity range from @xmath20 @xmath2 6 to 13 @xmath16 , while that in vla  2 is in the range of 0@xmath1016 @xmath16",
    ". we do not detect h@xmath11o maser emission with @xmath20 lower than 0 @xmath16 , which was detected in the two previous vlba observations in 1999 ( t03 ) and 2005 ( s11 ) , probably due to the high flux density variability of the h@xmath0o masers .",
    "with respect to the proper motion of the h@xmath0o masers , we estimate the mean values of @xmath1 2.1 and 2.5 @xmath32 ( @xmath1 20  km  s@xmath4@xmath7[d/2  kpc ] and @xmath1 24  km  s@xmath4@xmath7[d/2  kpc ] ) in vla  1 and vla  2 , respectively ( figures 3 and 4 ; table 1 ) .",
    "these mean values are very similar to those obtained previously with the vlba observations in 1999 , @xmath1 2 and 3 @xmath32 , respectively ( t03 ) . in  3.1",
    "we will concentrate on the h@xmath0o maser shell - like structure detected around vla  2 based on an elliptical fitting analysis , comparing our results with those from previous observations ( t03 , s11 ) .      from figure 4",
    ", we see that the northeastern and southwestern parts of the shell - like structure as observed with vera ( epoch 2007 ) present proper motions mainly toward the northeastern and southwestern directions , respectively , with similar proper motion values ( @xmath1 3 mas  yr@xmath4 ) .",
    "the maximum angular separation from the northeastern and southwestern parts of the shell ( those indicated in figure 4 by the labels b and d ) is @xmath1 220 mas , while the maximum angular separation within the shell observed in 1999 was @xmath1 154  mas ( t03 ) .",
    "this increase in the angular separation between the tips of the shell in eight years ( from 1999 to 2007 ) corresponds to an expanding velocity of @xmath1 4  mas  yr@xmath4 from the center .",
    "this expanding velocity is consistent with the proper motions measured in the individual masers of our three epochs of vera observations in 2007 ( figure 4 ; table 1 ) .    to perform a more detailed study of the evolution of the shell - like structure",
    ", we have made elliptical fits to the h@xmath0o maser positions detected with the vlba in 1999 ( april 2 , may 7 , and june 4 ; hereafter epoch 1999.3 ) and 2005 ( november 21 ; hereafter epoch 2005.9 ) , and with vera ( january 20 , february 21 , and may 29 ; hereafter 2007.2 ) .",
    "the ellipses have been fitted by minimizing the chi - squared distribution of the distance measured from the position of the masers to the ellipse , along a line connecting the maser to the center of the ellipse .",
    "the main parameters of the elliptical fits , i.e. the semi - major ( a ) and semi - minor axes ( b ) , and the position angle , are listed in table 2 . in figure 5",
    "we show the position of the masers and the resulting fitted ellipses for epochs 1999.3 ( ellipse t99 ) , 2005.9 ( ellipse s05 ) , and 2007.2 ( ellipse k07 ) , plotted together assuming the same center position .",
    "we note that the parameters of the elliptical fits we list in table 2 differ slightly from those listed by s11 for epochs 1999.3 and 2005.9 due to a fault in the algorithm used for the fitting in that previous paper .    comparing the ellipses , we see that the semi - major axis has increased progressively during the time span of eight years , from 71@xmath31 mas in 1999.3 ( ellipse t99 ) , to 97@xmath34 mas in 2005.9 ( ellipse s05 ) , and to 111@xmath31 mas in 2007.2 ( ellipse k07 ) .",
    "this corresponds to expanding velocities in the intervals t99@xmath10s05 : 3.9@xmath35 mas  yr@xmath4 , s05@xmath10k07 : 10.8@xmath36 mas  yr@xmath4 , and t99@xmath10k07 : 5.1@xmath37 mas  yr@xmath4 .",
    "all these values for the expanding velocities are compatible between them for the given errors we estimated , although showing some indications that the shell has suffered an acceleration in the s05@xmath10k07 interval ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "new epochs of vlbi h@xmath0o maser observations are necessary to clearly confirm it .",
    "another relevant result is that the expanding h@xmath0o maser shell - like structure has increased its ellipticity .",
    "in fact , the ratio of semi - minor to semi - major axes of the fitted ellipse ( b / a ) for epoch 2007.2 is @xmath1 0.6 , which is smaller than the one derived for the almost circular shells observed in epochs 1999.3 and 2005.9 , b / a @xmath1 0.9 ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "in addition , a more dominant axis of expansion appears along the northeast - southwest direction in epoch 2007.2 ( pa @xmath2 45@xmath14 ; figures 4 and 5 ) .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results in the study of the first stages of evolution of massive protostars in the next section .",
    "in this section , we focus on the long - term evolution of the h@xmath0o maser shell - like structure associated with the massive yso vla  2 .",
    "our vera observations have extended the time scale in which this structure has been observed , by adding a third long - term epoch ( 2007.2 ) to the observations of t03 ( epoch 1999.3 ) and s11 ( epoch 2005.9 ) , providing a solid result that the shell is still expanding in the plane of the sky at a velocity of @xmath1 5  mas  yr@xmath4 ( 47  km  s@xmath4@xmath7[d/2  kpc ] ) eight years after its discovery .",
    "the kinematic age of this expanding structure is @xmath1 20 years up to the epoch 2007 , a value in agreement with the kinematic age of 13 years estimated from the vlba observations of epoch 1999.3 ( t03 ) , considering the eight years between these observations and our vera observations . as discussed by t03 ,",
    "the most probably scenario for the origin of this h@xmath0o maser structure is a wind - driven shell , for which they obtained a wind mass - loss rate @xmath38 , terminal wind velocity @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the particle density and temperature of the shell , respectively ) , and density outside the shell ( molecular gas environment ) @xmath44 .",
    "these are reasonable parameters for early b stars ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) and molecular core ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "t03 and s11 also proposed that the ejected wind from the central massive object should be non - collimated ( to explain the almost circular shape of the shell observed in epochs 1999.3 and 2005.9 ) , as well as repetitive ( to explain the short kinematic age of the shell ) .",
    "besides that , the h@xmath0o maser structure continues to expand .",
    "our vera observations also indicate an apparent increase with time in the ellipticity of the shell , from an almost circular shape as observed in epochs 1999.3 and 2005.9 ( b / a @xmath1 0.9 ) , to a more elliptical shape as observed in epoch 2007.2 ( b / a @xmath1 0.6 ) , with a more dominant expansion along an axis with pa @xmath1 45@xmath14 ( see  3 , figure 5 and table 2 ) .",
    "this result is consistent with the prediction made previously by s11 , who noted that in the epoch 2005.9 there are preferential gas movements northeastward , suggesting the formation of a collimated outflow in that direction ( see h@xmath0o maser positions of s11 at @xmath1 [ 120 , 80 ] mas in figure 5 ) .",
    "furthermore , we found out that the previous proper motion measurements of the h@xmath0o masers of the vla  2 shell in epoch 1999.3 were already showing larger velocities in the plane of the sky along the northeast - southwest direction ( see figure 1 of t03 ) . in videot03",
    "( figure 7 ; published online ) , we show the expanding motions of the shell as measured by t03 but extrapolated 10 years ahead starting in epoch 1999.3 , where these main motions along the northeast - southwest direction are clearly seen . we think that this gives even more support to the northeast - southwest expansion direction of the shell in vla  2 .    based on these results",
    ", we suggest that we are probably observing the formation of a collimated jet - driven h@xmath0o maser structure , evolving from a non - collimated pulsed - outflow event during the first stages of evolution of a massive yso .",
    "the position angle of the new forming jet in vla  2 would be @xmath1 45@xmath14 , which interestingly is similar to the position angle of the nearby more evolved vla  1 radio jet ( pa @xmath1 40@xmath14 ;",
    "t03 ) , being separated both ysos by @xmath1 0.7@xmath6 ( @xmath1 1400 au@xmath7[d/2  kpc ] ) . in addition , this position angle is close to the direction of the large - scale magnetic field aligned to the large - scale bipolar molecular outflow in the region ( @xmath1 5@xmath48 , or @xmath1 3 pc , pa @xmath1 70@xmath14 ; shepherd et al .",
    "2003 ; s11 ) , but it is far from the average direction of the local magnetic field around vla  2 ( @xmath49 ; s11 ) .",
    "actually , the local magnetic field around vla  2 shows a radial morphology consistent with the recent simulations of massive star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that the local magnetic field in the region plays an important role in the early phases of the formation of the outflows but afterwards the large - scale magnetic field starts to dominate also in vla  2 .",
    "even though , s11 measured a stronger magnetic field around vla  2 ( @xmath50  mg ) than around vla  1 ( @xmath51  mg ) . to explain the evolution from a non - collimated outflow event to a collimated outflow in vla  2",
    ", we speculate on the presence of a disk - like gas structure around this massive object , oriented southeast - northwest ( perpendicular to the orientation of the local magnetic field in the region ) . in this scenario ,",
    "an `` isotropic '' ejection event from the central source would expand more freely in the direction perpendicular to the disk - like structure , along the magnetic field lines .",
    "if this scenario works , it would imply that the disk - like structure has a central  hole \" ( cavity ) of @xmath1 60@xmath1090 mas radius , the size of the semi - minor axis of the shell .",
    "this scenario fits quite well with the three - dimensional mhd simulations performed by @xcite .",
    "they found that in the earliest stage of a massive star formation , the outflows are non - collimated if a strong magnetic field is present .",
    "afterwards , their collimation increases quickly due to the development of a fast , central jet coupled to the build - up of a keplerian disk .",
    "`` short - lived '' pulsed ejections ( some of them isotropic or non - collimated ) have been observed through vlbi h@xmath0o maser observations in different massive protostars , including w75n vla2 .",
    "it is still unclear whether these are non - standard phenomena in particular types of sources , or if all massive protostars undergo short - lived pulsed ejection phases .",
    "nevertheless , their presence provides new insights in the study of the formation of high - mass stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "what we are observing now in w75n vla  2 is the likely formation of a collimated outflow from a non - collimated expanding shell , as theoretically expected from the mhd simulations of @xcite .",
    "however , we think that new epochs of vlbi h@xmath0o maser observations , even in full polarization , are mandatory to confirm this tendency found with our vera observations ( including a possible acceleration in the shell ) .",
    "jvla observations at cm / mm wavelengths would be very important to see if the central radio continuum source ( vla  2 ) has also evolved into an elongated structure along the northeast - southwest direction , like the nearby radio jet in vla  1 .",
    "high - angular resolution , sensitive ( sub)mm observations to study the dust and molecular gas distribution around vla  2 would also help to understand the evolution of this expanding shell .",
    "we have carried out three epochs of vlbi observations of h@xmath0o masers during 2007 toward the high - mass star - forming region of w75n with @xmath1 1 mas of angular resolution , comparing our data with previously obtained in 1999 and 2005 .",
    "we find that the h@xmath0o maser shell associated with the massive yso vla  2 is still expanding at @xmath1 5  mas  yr@xmath4 ( @xmath1 47  km  s@xmath4@xmath7[d/2  kpc ] ) eight years after its discovery in epoch 1999 .",
    "the shell , with a current size of 222  mas@xmath7136  mas ( 444  au@xmath7272  au at 2  kpc ) and kinematic age of @xmath1 20  yr , shows a ratio between the minor and major axes of @xmath1 0.6 , in contrast with a most circular shape of the shell as observed in 1999 and 2005 .",
    "these results would suggest that we are probably observing the formation of a jet - driven water maser structure , as previously proposed and consistent with recent mhd simulations of massive star formation by seifried et al .",
    "these mhd simulations predict that at the earliest stage , the outflows are poorly collimated for a short - lived period , evolving into a collimated outflow , as we are probably observing in vla  2 .",
    "new epochs of vlbi h@xmath0o maser observations are mandatory to confirm this tendency found with our vera observations ( including a possible acceleration in the shell ) .    we would like to thank our referee for his / her very careful review of the manuscript , which has helped to substantially improve its content .",

    "<S> we present very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations of 22 ghz h@xmath0o masers in the high - mass star - forming region of , carried out with vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ( vera ) for three - epochs in 2007 with an angular resolution of @xmath1 1 mas . </S>",
    "<S> we detected h@xmath0o maser emission toward the radio jet in vla  1 and the expanding shell - like structure in vla  2 . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial distribution of the h@xmath0o masers detected with vera and measured proper motions around vla  1 and vla  2 are similar to those found with previous vlbi observations in epochs 1999 and 2005 , with the masers in vla  1 mainly distributed along a linear structure parallel to the radio jet and , on the other hand , forming a shell - like structure around vla  2 . </S>",
    "<S> we have made elliptical fits to the vla  2 h@xmath0o maser shell - like structure observed in the different epochs ( 1999 , 2005 , and 2007 ) , and found that the shell is still expanding eight years after its discovery . from the difference in the size of the semi - major axes of the fitted ellipses in the epochs 1999 ( @xmath2 71@xmath31 mas ) , 2005 ( @xmath2 97@xmath33 mas ) , and 2007 ( @xmath2 111@xmath31 mas ) , we estimate an average expanding velocity of @xmath1 5  mas  yr@xmath4 , similar to the proper motions measured in the individual h@xmath0o maser features . a kinematic age of @xmath1 20  yr is derived for this structure . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our vera observations indicate an increase in the ellipticity of the expanding shell around vla  2 from epochs 1999 to 2007 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the elliptical fit of the vera data shows a ratio between the minor and major axes of @xmath1 0.6 , in contrast with a most circular shape for the shell detected in 1999 and 2005 ( b / a @xmath1 0.9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that we are probably observing the formation of a jet - driven h@xmath0o maser structure in vla2 , evolving from a non - collimated pulsed - outflow event during the first stages of evolution of a massive young stellar object ( yso ) . </S>",
    "<S> this may support predictions made earlier by other authors on this issue , consistent with recent magnetohydrodynamical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss possible implications of our results in the study of the first stages of evolution of massive ysos . </S>"
