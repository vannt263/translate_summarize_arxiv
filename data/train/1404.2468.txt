    "processes on complex networks may consist of events on links with a specific starting time and duration .",
    "when no event happens , the link can be considered as temporarily absent .",
    "typical examples are communication networks or airline connections .",
    "phenomena related to such processes are best described within the framework of temporal networks  @xcite .",
    "many important time dependent processes taking place on various complex networks exhibit bursty nature , i.e. , the events of such processes are distributed very heterogeneously in time . besides the burstiness of natural phenomena like earthquakes or the firing of neurons , processes in several man - made or sociological systems like contact patterns in human communication networks",
    "are known to be bursty as well .",
    "one of the most important characteristics of this bursty dynamics is the inter - event time distribution ( ietd ) , which has a power - law form in a broad regime of time in many systems of interest @xcite .    in recent years , it has been a major challenge to understand how burstiness influences spreading phenomena on networks . despite of the considerable effort devoted to this question",
    "the answers are still contradictory . using empirical contact sequences to study random walks , starnini et al .",
    "@xcite showed that burstiness present in empirical data slows down considerably the random walk exploration . by analyzing the spread of e - mail worms using data of a commercial provider @xcite and by the investigation of rumor spreading in a mobile communication network @xcite the burstiness",
    "was found to slow down spreading , whereas in the work of rocha et al .",
    "@xcite similar studies using human network of sexual contacts suggest that bursty temporality accelerates disease spread .",
    "while analytically solvable models provide some insight into how burstiness influences spreading , they are usually not flexible enough to incorporate important details like network topology , however , according to the analytically solvable si model of jo et al .",
    "@xcite , the power - law ietd steered dynamics always results in faster spreading than the corresponding poissonian - like dynamics that also points towards fast bursty spreading .",
    "some papers present a more complex picture . based on analysis of mobile phone calls , miritello et al .",
    "@xcite claim that long waiting times hinders but group conversations favour the spread of information and the overall spreading is determined by the competition of these two factors . in the paper of holme",
    "@xcite the role of the beginning and end time of communication sequences is pointed out and in the work of rocha et al .",
    "@xcite non - stationary bursty processes yield faster than poissonian spreading in si and sir models in a large regime of parameters .    in this paper",
    "we wish to contribute to better understanding the influencing factors of the spreading on networks by studying the so called susceptible - infected ( si ) model  @xcite with bursty temporality and some particular topological properties affecting spreading .",
    "we will also point out the effect of the age of the process , i.e. , that of non - stationarity . while these models are still simplifications of the complex , real world situations with many correlations ignored here , we hope that by systematic investigations we can identify and understand the role of each factor in the outcome of the spreading and in its speed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we define the model and the quantities of interest . then we discuss the case of the cayley tree , where some analytical results can be achieved . in _ section 4",
    "_ we compare the spreading behavior of barabsi - albert trees and networks in the stationary state .",
    "the following section contains the results on the role of non - stationarity .",
    "the paper ends with a summary and discussion .",
    "processes are defined on temporal networks , in which the network topology enters the model through the aggregated network .",
    "the aggregated network is defined as the static graph consisting of the nodes of the temporal network and the links where at least one event takes place . for aggregated networks ,",
    "we consider cayley trees ( regular trees ) , where analytical calculations are possible .",
    "cayley trees are trees , i.e. , networks without loops in which all the nodes have exactly the same number of neighbors or equivalently the same degree denoted by @xmath0 .",
    "we consider also barabsi - albert ( ba ) networks @xcite , which share some properties of real world networks . in the ba model",
    "the network is grown by adding nodes one by one with linear preferential attachment @xcite .",
    "ba networks are known to behave locally as trees as they have very low number of loops @xcite . by changing the degree @xmath1 of the new born nodes in the ba network",
    ", we can compare spreading on a tree ( @xmath2 ) and on graphs with loops ( @xmath3 ) , however keeping the locally tree - like feature .    in our model the inter - event times",
    "are the time intervals between the events between a given pair of nodes in the temporal network .",
    "as already mentioned , the inter - event times are characterized by the ietd , which are identically distributed , independent ( iid ) random variables for all edges in our model , thus we consider on the links independent renewal processes with iid inter - event times . in general , the process is non - markovian and it takes ( infinitely ) long time to reach stationarity .",
    "if the ietd is exponential , we have a poisson process , which , due to its `` memoryless '' character , is instantaneously stationary .      to take the burstiness of the temporal processes into account , we use the pareto distribution for the inter - event time distribution : @xmath4 in eqn . @xmath5",
    "denotes the lower cut - off and the @xmath6 exponent determines the the fatness of the tail of the distribution . to demonstrate the impact of burstiness",
    ", it is worth comparing the effect of power - law and exponential ietd on the spreading .",
    "for this reason we prescribe the same mean for the applied ietd - s denoted by @xmath7 and use modified exponential functions with lower cut - off too : @xmath8 this choice enables to investigate the importance of the lower cut - off @xcite , @xcite .",
    "since the mean is kept fixed in these distributions , the @xmath6 parameters can be expressed by means of @xmath7 and @xmath5 with their ratio @xmath9 .",
    "then one gets @xmath10 for both the pareto and the modified exponential case . for the exponential distributions",
    "an important limiting case is when @xmath11 or @xmath12 , which yields a homogeneous poisson process .",
    "the dynamical process on a link is characterized by the ietd , however , the time to be waited by a newly infected node to infect one of its neighbors , which is referred to as the waiting time , is characterized by the waiting time distribution ( wtd ) , which is the distribution of the time to be waited between a random time ( the infection of a node ) and an event ( transmission ) . in general",
    ", the wtd depends also on the age @xmath13 of the process @xcite unless the process is poissonian , when the ietd and wtd coincide . for the stationary case ( @xmath14 ) , the wtd @xmath15 from a given ietd p(t ) with mean @xmath7",
    "is given as @xcite :    @xmath16    in the literature on spreading stationarity has been usually implicitly assumed by using for the wtd ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , however , the problem of stationarity will prove to be of fundamental importance regarding the spreading speed .      to model bursty spreading we choose the simplest susceptible - infected ( si ) model , in which the links between the nodes are present or active at specific instants of time corresponding the temporal network picture with no duration of the events . in the si spreading model , at t=0",
    "we infect a node and from this instant the disease propagates with probability 1 if there is an existing link between an infected and a susceptible node .    the basic quantity that characterises the spreading is the curve given by the fraction of infected nodes versus time or in infinite networks the number of infected nodes versus time .",
    "this curve can be calculated as the mean of random variables , however , the averaging can be done either by fixing time @xmath17 and taking the average number or fraction of nodes at this instant , or by fixing the number or fraction of infected nodes and calculating the average elapsed time until the system reaches this given level of infection",
    ". both ways of averaging provide important and relevant quantities ; averaging according to the first method tells us the average level of infection after time @xmath17 , and the second method telling the average time until a given level of infection is reached can be important , e.g. for studies of vaccination or prevention strategies . in the following we will refer to the first method as @xmath18 average , and to the second method as @xmath19 average .",
    "these averages are related to each other ( see _ appendix a _ ) .",
    "as long as the aggregated networks are infinite cayley trees it is possible to obtain either the whole spreading curve or the early time and late time asymptotics of the spreading curves in the stationary state , therefore we begin with presenting some analytic calculations .",
    "concerning the @xmath19 curve we restrict ourselves only to the poissonian case , whereas the derivation of the @xmath18 curve is of more general nature . for the derivation of both curves we consider cayley trees with @xmath0 branches per nodes or nodes with degree @xmath0 and @xmath20",
    "denotes the number of infected nodes .    to obtain the @xmath19 curve for the poissonian dynamics",
    ", one needs to consider the number of _ active _ links @xmath21 , i.e. , the number of links between infected and susceptible nodes after the _",
    "i_-th node is infected .",
    "it is easy to write down the recursion @xmath22 , which has the solution @xmath23 .",
    "since the poisson process is memoryless , the average value of the next infection time given that there are @xmath24 active links is merely the expected value of the minimum of @xmath24 iid exponential random variables with mean @xmath7 , which is @xmath25 , therefore the following equation can be written for the average time of the @xmath26-th infection :    @xmath27    whose solution is @xmath28 where @xmath29 . as @xmath30 for large @xmath31",
    "one can see that the @xmath19 inverse curve is of the form @xmath32 for large @xmath17 . as the poissonian assumption",
    "was heavily used in this derivation , this reasoning can not be generalized to other ietd - s .    for the @xmath18 curves the theory of the bellman - harris branching processes @xcite , @xcite",
    "can be made use of .",
    "for this , let @xmath33 denote the number of _ infected _ links , that is the number of links in the aggregated network having at least one infected node on its ends and let @xmath34 be the number of such links in one branch of the initially infected node .",
    "it is easy to see , that the number of infected nodes @xmath20 is expressed as : @xmath35 let then @xmath36 be a stochastic process , so for a given @xmath17 , @xmath36 is a random variable telling the number of _ infected _ links in one branch for a given time .",
    "supposing first that each node infects its neighbors after a fixed value of @xmath37 , we can write the following equation :    @xmath38    here @xmath39 denotes identical copies of @xmath40 . using the generating function of @xmath40 defined as @xmath41 z^n$ ] eqn .",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath42 integrating eqn . over @xmath37 with its weight function , which is the wtd , and differentiating @xmath43 with respect to @xmath44 and finally setting @xmath45 we arrive for @xmath46 denoting the average of @xmath40 at    @xmath47    it is worth taking the laplace transform of eqn . and after some arrangement one obtains @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote the laplace transform of @xmath46 and @xmath15 . as @xmath51 and from , we get for the average number of infected nodes the following relationship : @xmath52 where the linearity of is made use of .    if the dynamics is poissonian , @xmath53 and the inverse transformation of eqn .",
    "is simple , yielding @xmath54 comparing this formula with the @xmath19 average ( eqn . )",
    ", we can conclude that for large @xmath17 both averages predict exponential growth according to @xmath55 .    if , however , the ietd is a power - law or an exponential with a lower cut - off , only the asymptotic behaviour can be calculated analytically .",

    "it yields : @xmath63 it is easy to see that the asymptotics of both @xmath64 and @xmath65 is determined by the first term in eqn . and .",
    "the emergence of this term in the laplace transforms comes from the lower cut - off in the ietd , which results in a constant term in the wtd . as a consequence , in case of either the pareto or the modified exponential ietd , the laplace transform of the wtd has the same asymptotics for large @xmath66 , resulting in practically the same curve for sufficiently small times : @xmath67 according to eqn .",
    "as long as the @xmath18 average is considered and the dynamics is stationary the modified exponential and power - law governed spreading is always faster on average than the simple poissonian spreading if @xmath17 is sufficiently small and despite of the absence of the @xmath6 dependence in the asymptotic form of @xmath68 the size of lower cut - off determines the domain of validity of eqn . as @xmath69 has to hold when approximating @xmath70 .",

    "we can then conclude that the more narrow the ietd is , the faster resulted spreading is seen .",
    "this result is similar to that presented in @xcite in which diffusion processes are studied and essentially the second moment of the wtd characterizes the broadness of the distribution .",

    "the @xmath18 average is not very sensitive to the tail of the wtd .",

    "[ bottleneck ] .",
    "when a part of the network gets entirely infected , and there is only one edge in the aggregated network between the set of infected and the susceptible nodes , the waiting time for the next infection can be extremely long .",
    "the reason is that the waiting time can have no expectation value and due to the lack of loops , the bottleneck can not be circumvented .",
    "indeed , for finite trees , the existence of the mean of the wtd guarantees the well defined average spreading curve , whereas if no mean exits for the waiting time , due to the reasons mentioned above , i.e. , the lack of loops meaning that the spreading has to pass each bottleneck , the curve can not be smoothened by increasing the averaged simulation runs . for power - law stationary dynamics , the wtd for @xmath124 is proportional to @xmath125 , thus for @xmath122 the wtd has no finite expected value , but for @xmath126 it has .",
    "hence , for @xmath127 the jumps do not vanish by increasing the number of runs , that is , actually no average exists .",

    "the lack of meaningful averages is independent of the degree of the initially infected node if @xmath130 , showing that the effect is merely due to the absence of loops .",
    "this clearly demonstrates the difference between trees and ba networks if the temporal processes are bursty . despite ba networks",
    "are locally tree - like , the existence of loops or the lack of bottlenecks seems to be crucial to having meaningful @xmath19 averages if the ietd of the bursty processes is strongly fat - tailed .",
    "thus the emergence of jumps in the averages can also be regarded as a nice interplay of temporal and topological effects .",
    "there is a subtlety regarding the infection of low degree nodes in ba networks with loops .",
    "let us first consider the case when the spreading starts from such a node with degree @xmath105 . for power - law , stationary dynamics ( see _ appendix c _ for details ) the average first infection time is finite if @xmath131 ( eqn . ) , meaning that for @xmath6 below this threshold , there is a jump in the spreading curve for any averaging",
    ". starting the process from a large degree node as done in the above simulations the alternative routes enabled by the loops do not allow for the emergence of a bottleneck up to the very late stage , when only some of the low degree nodes remain susceptible .",
    "for example , it can be shown by similar reasoning to that in _ appendix c _ , the average infection time of the very last node diverges for sufficiently small @xmath132 .",
    "however , the steps induced by the infection of such low degree nodes appear only in the very late stage of the process thus they do not influence the interesting part of the spreading curve .",
    "we have already emphasized that the use of is allowed if the temporal processes are assumed to have been existing for infinitely long time . in many networks",
    "several effects ( e.g. daily periodicity in communication networks ) hinder the system to reach stationarity , therefore it is essential to study the effect of non - stationary dynamics as well , which , however , has not gained much attention in the literature so far .",
    "non - stationary processes can be realized in many ways , the one we choose is simple and of practical importance .",
    "we define the temporal network as follows . for each link in the aggregated network , we define a starting time , when the first contact is established between the nodes in the temporal network corresponding to the link . from this time the contacts",
    "follow each other according to the ietd .",
    "the starting time has different values for the edges as it is equal to @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is a uniformly distributed random uncorrelated variable between @xmath135 $ ] and @xmath136 is a non - negative number . as the first infection happens at @xmath137 , @xmath138 is the average age of the processes at the initial infection . if the si infection is simulated , similarly to the way presented in _",
    "section 4 _ we can deal with events only between susceptible and infected nodes .",
    "the only difference is , that if node @xmath98 is infected at time @xmath17 , the possible infection times of its neighbors are generated by adding random numbers corresponding to the ietd from @xmath133 until the sum is larger than @xmath17 .",
    "if the temporal process is poissonian , there is no difference in the stationary and the non - stationary dynamics defined above .",
    "if the ietd is a modified exponential , the difference between the stationary and non - stationary behaviour should vanish rapidly with increasing @xmath138 , as these distributions have fast convergence to zero for large times .",
    "these expectations are supported by numerical simulations , even for @xmath139 the stationary and non - stationary curves are notably close to each other .",
    "non - stationarity has a remarkable effect on the spreading for power - law ietd governed dynamics .",
    "this is reflected both in the spreading speed and in the convergence to the asymptotic behaviour ( @xmath140 ) . the response to tuning",
    "@xmath6 is the opposite to what we saw in the stationary case for small @xmath138 , i.e. , decreasing the power - law exponent the infection accelerates fig .",
    "[ powietossz ] .",
