    "our main goal in this paper is to obtain a simpler proof that , under the sweep map , the @xmath3 statistic of a rational dyck path @xmath4 becomes the @xmath5 statistic of its image path @xmath6 .",
    "the first proof of this remarkable identity is due to loehr and warrington in @xcite .",
    "there is also a second proof due to gorsky and mazin in @xcite .    inspired by a recent work of nathan williams @xcite ,",
    "we have come to depict rational dyck paths in a manner which makes the ranks of the vertices of a path consistent with its visual representation .",
    "this very simple change turns out to be conducive to considerable simplifications in proving many of the properties of rational dyck paths .",
    "witness the proof of the invertibity of the sweep map given in @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : goodpair ] we have depicted a path @xmath7 in the @xmath8 lattice rectangle and its sweep map image @xmath6 as they are traditionally depicted .",
    "the ranks of the vertices of an @xmath2-path are constructed by assigning @xmath9 to the origin @xmath10 and adding an @xmath0 after a north step and subtracting an @xmath1 after an east step .",
    "the sweep image of @xmath4 is obtained by letting the main diagonal sweep ( parallel to its original position ) from right to left , the vertices of @xmath11 and drawing a north step of @xmath6 when we sweep the south end of a north step of @xmath7 and draw an east step when we sweep the west end of an east step .",
    "the steps of @xmath6 can also be obtained by rearranging the steps of @xmath7 by increasing ranks of their starting vertices .",
    "the ` area ` of a rational dyck path is equal to the number of lattice cells between the path and the main diagonal . by a result in (",
    "? * lemma  11 ) a cell @xmath12 above an @xmath2-dyck path @xmath6 contributes a unit to its dinv statistic if and only if the starting rank @xmath13 of the east step of @xmath6 below @xmath12 and the starting rank @xmath14 of the north step of d to the right of @xmath12 satisfy the inequality @xmath15 . in our display , the cells contributing to @xmath16 are distinguished by a green square .",
    "a quick count reveals that @xmath17    to proceed we need some notation .",
    "let @xmath2 be a co - prime pair of positive integers .",
    "a tableau @xmath18 consists of an ordered set of @xmath1 red arrows and @xmath0 blue arrows , placed on a @xmath19 lattice rectangle . where @xmath20 is a large positive integer to be specified .",
    "a red arrow is the up vector @xmath21 and a blue arrow is the down vector @xmath22 .",
    "the rows of    lattice cells will be referred to as rows and the horizontal lattice lines will be simply referred to as lines . on the left of each line",
    "we have placed its @xmath23 coordinate which we will refer to as its level .",
    "the level of the starting point of an arrow is called its starting rank , and similarly its end rank is the level of its end point",
    ". it will be convenient to call row @xmath24 the row of lattice cells delimited by the lines at levels @xmath24 and @xmath25 . given a word @xmath26 with @xmath1 letters @xmath27 and @xmath0 letters @xmath28 , and a sequence of @xmath29 weakly positive ranks @xmath30 , the tableau @xmath31 ( see figure [ fig : tableau ] ) is obtained by placing the letters of @xmath26 at the bottom of the lattice columns and drawing in the @xmath32 column an arrow with starting rank @xmath33 and @xmath34 if the @xmath32 letter of @xmath26 is an @xmath27 or @xmath35 if the @xmath32 letter of @xmath26 is a @xmath28 .",
    "figure [ fig : tableau ] depicts our manner of drawing the path @xmath4 .",
    "the ranks of @xmath4 are now the circled levels of the starting vertices .",
    "notice that each lattice cell may contain a segment of a red arrow or a segment of a blue arrow or no segment at all .",
    "the red segment count of row @xmath36 will be denoted @xmath37 and the blue segment count is denoted @xmath38 .",
    "we will set @xmath39 and refer to it as the count of row @xmath36 .",
    "notice that , for obvious reasons , the row counts in the above tableau are invariably all equal to zero .",
    "this property has the following immediate consequence .",
    "[ p-1.1]the starting rank of any arrow @xmath40 of @xmath6 may be simply obtained by drawing in green the line at the starting level of its preimage @xmath41 , then counting the segments above the green line of any red arrow of @xmath4 that starts below the green line and adding to that count the number of segments below the green line of any blue arrow of @xmath4 that starts above the green line .",
    "the desired rank is @xmath42 , when @xmath4 has @xmath14 red arrows and @xmath13 blue arrows that start below the green line .",
    "the reason this number can be obtained as stated is due to the zero sum property .",
    "indeed , the count of red segments above the green line is certainly needed .",
    "the remaining portion of @xmath42 is obtained by counting blue segments below the green line since the latter are subtracted from the remaining portion to make equal to zero the line counts below the green line .",
    "see figure [ fig : bigpair ] for an example .",
    "this proposition leads to the basic formula we will use to compute the area of the image @xmath6 by working on the preimage @xmath4 .",
    "[ t-1.1 ] for any @xmath2-dyck path @xmath6 , with @xmath2 co - prime , we have @xmath43 where `` @xmath44 '' denotes the rank of the south end of the @xmath45 north step of @xmath6 .",
    "notice that that if we define the rank of the lattice cell whose south - west coordinates are @xmath46 by setting @xmath47 , then the least positive rank in the @xmath45 row is none other than the remainder of @xmath48 mod @xmath1 . since the residues modulo @xmath1 are @xmath49 and the least positive ranks are distinct , it follows that their sum is @xmath50 .",
    "calling @xmath51 the least positive rank in row @xmath36 , it is evident that @xmath52 is the contribution of row @xmath36 to the area of @xmath6 .",
    "this given , we see that is simply obtained by summing all these contributions .",
    "given a co - prime pair @xmath2 , our argument is to show that as we decrease the area of the preimage @xmath4 by one unit , both dinv and area satisfy the same recursion .",
    "we have depicted in figure [ fig : redblueb ] the cell that we have subtracted from the preimage @xmath4 to obtain a preimage @xmath53 with one less unit of area .",
    "this operation may be viewed as replacing a red arrow @xmath27 of @xmath53 by a dashed red arrow @xmath54 and a blue arrow @xmath28 by a dashed blue arrow @xmath55 .",
    "calling @xmath6 and @xmath56 the sweep map images of @xmath4 and @xmath53 , our task is to determine the difference @xmath57 .",
    "our tool will be formula and the fact that the starting rank of any arrow @xmath40 of @xmath6 is @xmath58 where @xmath4 has @xmath14 red arrows and @xmath13 blue arrows that start below the preimage @xmath59 of @xmath40 in @xmath4 .",
    "this difference will be calculated in @xmath4 and @xmath53 by means of our tool .",
    "now there are @xmath60 distinct cases .",
    "firstly , red arrows that start above level @xmath61 ( see figure ) or below level @xmath62 are not affected by the replacements .",
    "thus their contribution to the difference is @xmath9 .",
    "secondly in the case of any red arrow starting strictly below level @xmath63 and strictly above level @xmath64 , its contribution to the difference is @xmath1 .",
    "the reason for this is that both red arrows in the display will increase the ranks of the arrows of @xmath6 and @xmath56 , whose starting levels are in this range by an equal amount , therefore they cancel each other .",
    "by contrast the dashed blue arrow will affect the ranks of the red arrows of @xmath56 so that the contribution of each to the difference is @xmath65 .",
    "thirdly , notice that each red arrow of @xmath6 or @xmath56 that starts strictly below rank @xmath64 and strictly above rank @xmath62 , is not affected by either of the blue arrows .",
    "but each of the red arrows of @xmath56 is affected by the dashed red arrow and thus contributes a @xmath66 to the difference .",
    "the reason is that the arrows that start below level @xmath62 contribute equally to the areas of @xmath27 and @xmath54 .",
    "thus they cancel in computing the desired difference . on the other hand",
    "all the arrows accounted for in do contribute to the area of @xmath27 but not to the area of @xmath54 .",
    "notice first that the contribution to the area difference in the third case is the negative of the first part of the contribution obtained in .",
    "it results from this that all the remaining contributions are multiples of @xmath1 .",
    "( a convenient fact since , according to , @xmath1 has to be divided out . )    furthermore , in the second case this multiple counts the number of red arrows that have a red segment in @xmath68 or @xmath69 .",
    "finally , we see in that the factor of @xmath1 that survives the cancellation , counts exactly the arrows that have a blue segment in @xmath70 or @xmath71 .",
    "[ p-2.1]let @xmath72 be obtained from @xmath4 by removing an area cell and let @xmath6 and @xmath56 be their sweep map images .",
    "let @xmath70 and @xmath71 be the blue regions and @xmath68 and @xmath69 be the red regions in figure [ fig : redblueb ] .",
    "then @xmath73 where @xmath74 denote red segment counts and @xmath75 denote blue segment counts in the corresponding regions .",
    "[ p-2.2 ] the dinv statistic of a rational dyck path @xmath6 ( given in our stretched form ) may simply be obtained by counting the pairs @xmath76 consisting of a blue arrow to the left of a red arrow , such that @xmath77 must touch @xmath78 as it moves to the right past @xmath78 .",
    "suppose that @xmath77 has starting rank @xmath13 and @xmath78 has starting rank @xmath14 . by the quoted result of loehr - warrington , the pair @xmath76 contribute a unit to @xmath79 if and only if @xmath80 .",
    "this is equivalent to requiring that @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "but these two inequalities are precisely what is needed to guarantee that @xmath77 must touch @xmath78 as it moves horizontally past it .",
    "[ p-2.3]let @xmath53 be obtained from @xmath4 by removing an area cell .",
    "let @xmath70 and @xmath68 be the blue regions and @xmath71 and @xmath69 be the red regions in figure [ fig : redbluea ] . then @xmath83 where @xmath84 denote blue segment counts and @xmath85 denote red segment counts in the corresponding regions .",
    "since @xmath53 is obtained from @xmath4 by replacing the solid arrows @xmath87 by dashed arrows @xmath88 ( see figure [ fig : redbluea ] ) , we can divide the contribution of a pair @xmath89 to the difference @xmath90 into four cases .",
    "\\(2 ) both @xmath77 and @xmath78 are in the displayed arrows .",
    "this can only happen in two ways : @xmath91 in @xmath4 ( no dinv ) or @xmath92 in @xmath53 ( @xmath93 dinv ) .",
    "therefore the contribution to the difference in this case is @xmath94 .",
    "\\(3 ) only @xmath77 is one of the displayed arrows .",
    "then we need to consider the pairs @xmath95 in @xmath4 and @xmath96 in @xmath53 .",
    "their contribution to the difference is @xmath93 if @xmath78 has a red segment in @xmath69 , @xmath94 if @xmath78 has a red segment in @xmath71 and @xmath9 if @xmath78 does not have a segment in neither @xmath69 or @xmath71 .",
    "\\(4 ) only @xmath78 is in the displayed arrows .",
    "then we need to consider the pairs @xmath97 in @xmath4 and @xmath98 in @xmath53 .",
    "their contribution to the difference is @xmath93 if @xmath77 has a blue segment in @xmath68 , @xmath94 if @xmath77 has a blue segment in @xmath70 and @xmath9 if @xmath77 does not have a segment in neither @xmath68 or @xmath70 .",
    "we fist show that the recursions in and are identical . to do this",
    "it is sufficient to observe that @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the reason for this is the alternating colors of segments in each row that always begin with a red segment and end with a blue segment .",
    "this reduces us to verify the identity in the basic case where @xmath101 .",
    "the only @xmath2-dyck path with area @xmath9 is the path @xmath102 that remains as close as possible to the main diagonal .",
    "thus the ranks of the south ends of such a path are a rearrangement of @xmath103 .",
    "this forces the image @xmath6 of @xmath102 to start with @xmath1 north steps and end with @xmath0 east steps .",
    "this is the path of maximum area .",
    "it remains to prove that @xmath102 has maximum dinv , or equivalently every cell above @xmath102 contributes to its dinv . by contradiction , suppose that for a pair @xmath76 , @xmath77 does not sweep @xmath78 .",
    "we have the following two cases .",
    "see figure [ fig : basecase ] .",
    "\\(1 ) @xmath78 starts at a level above @xmath77 .",
    "assume we have @xmath104 for some @xmath105 .",
    "then consider the path obtained from @xmath4 by changing this to @xmath106 .",
    "this is a new dyck path with area one less than that of @xmath4 .",
    "a contradiction !",
    "\\(2 ) @xmath78 ends below the level of @xmath77 , then assume we have @xmath107 for some @xmath105 .",
    "then consider the path obtained from @xmath4 by changing this to @xmath108 .",
    "this is a new dyck path with area one less than that of @xmath4 .",
    "a contradiction !",
    "we terminate our presentation by a few comments .",
    "to begin we should note that our argument does not use proposition [ p-1.1 ] .",
    "we have nevertheless included it in this writing for two reasons .",
    "firstly because it is too surprising a result to leave out , but more importantly , because it gives a simple proof of the not trivial result that the sweep image of a dyck path is also a dyck path . the reason for this is that it is implicit in the conclusion of the proposition that the starting ranks of all the arrows of the image are non - negative .",
    "the latter is the only property needed to guarantee that the image of an @xmath2-dyck path is an @xmath2-dyck path .",
    "finally we remark that the  dinv sweeps to area \" result was known to hold in the non - coprime case , but no proof appeared in the literature .",
    "( gregory warrington told us their proof in @xcite can be extended for this case . )",
    "our proof naturally extends for the non - coprime case as we explain below .",
    "let @xmath2 be coprime and let @xmath64 be a positive integer . we are considering lattice paths in the @xmath109 rectangle .",
    "the rank of lattice points are defined as before , but now different points may have the same rank .",
    "the @xmath5 statistic extends naturally , but we must be careful about the ties for sweep map and the @xmath3 statistic .",
    "the dinv statistic we are using is the same as the @xmath110 statistic in ( * ? ? ? * lemma  11 ) : a cell @xmath12 above an @xmath111-dyck path @xmath4 contributes a unit to its dinv statistic if and only if the starting rank @xmath13 of the east step of @xmath4 below @xmath12 and the starting rank @xmath14 of the north step of @xmath4 to the right of @xmath12 satisfy the inequality @xmath112 , which is equivalent to @xmath113 . in our stretched form",

    "an alternative description is to move @xmath77 to the right along a line of slope @xmath114 for sufficiently small @xmath115 .    with this description and",
    "redo the computation we will see that proposition [ p-2.3 ] holds for @xmath111-dyck paths , except that we need to move region @xmath69 one level up and region @xmath70 one level down .    for the corresponding sweep map ,",
