    "the question on the formation of the present - day massive spheroidals is one of the most debated issues of galaxy evolution and it is strongly linked to the general problem of structure formation in the universe ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . in one scenario , massive spheroidals are formed at early cosmological epochs ( e.g. @xmath0 ) through the `` monolithic '' collapse of the whole gas mass@xcite .",
    "such a formation would be characterized by an episode of intense star formation , followed by a passive evolution ( or pure luminosity evolution , ple ) of the stellar population to nowadays . in marked contrast",
    ", the hierarchical scenarios predict that massive spheroidals are the product of rather recent merging of pre - existing disk galaxies taking place mostly at @xmath1@xcite . in hierarchical scenarios ,",
    "fully assembled massive field spheroidals at @xmath2 are rare objects@xcite , and the spheroids of cluster ellipticals were assembled before those of field ellipticals@xcite . from an observational point of view ,",
    "a direct way to test the above scenarios is to search for massive field ellipticals at @xmath2 and to compare their number with the model predictions ( see the introduction of @xcite for a recent review on observational tests ) .",
    "since the near - ir light is a good tracer of the galaxy mass@xcite , @xmath3-band imaging provides an important possibility to perform surveys aimed at selecting massive ellipticals at high-@xmath4 . a galaxy with a stellar mass of about @xmath5 m@xmath6 is expected to have @xmath7 for @xmath8@xcite , thus implying that moderately deep @xmath3-band surveys can efficiently select massive galaxies .",
    "a first selection criterion to find ellipticals at @xmath2 is to apply a color threshold to @xmath3-band selected galaxies . in the framework of passive evolution , such a threshold",
    "is set by the colors expected for a galaxy at @xmath2 formed at a given @xmath9 .",
    "for instance , according to the bruzual & charlot ( 1999 ) spectral synthesis models ( @xmath10 , salpeter imf ) , a very red color of @xmath11 would allow to select @xmath12 passively evolving galaxies formed at @xmath13 ( @xmath14=50 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 , @xmath16 ) , thus allowing to search for elliptical candidates formed at early epochs .",
    "however , searches based on color selection criteria gave discrepant results : some works showed that the number of such red galaxies is lower compared to the predictions of ple@xcite , whereas others did not confirm such a deficit up to redshifts of about two@xcite .    in order to avoid the possible biases ( e.g. star formation ) present in the color selection technique , another approach is to derive the fraction of ellipticals by taking spectra of all the galaxies in @xmath3-selected samples irrespectively of colors@xcite ( see also http://www.arcetri.astro.it/@xmath17k20/ ) . this method allows to overcome the putative problem of ellipticals missed because bluer than the adopted color threshold due to a low level of residual star formation@xcite .    finally , the third possibility to find @xmath2 ellipticals is to select galaxies according to their morphology and surface brightness profiles ( with or without an associated color selection criterion ) .",
    "this approach was adopted for example by @xcite for @xmath18 , and by @xcite for @xmath2 .",
    "while the results seem to agree with no or little number density evolution for early type galaxies at @xmath1 , the analysis of the @xmath2 samples led again to discrepant results , thus making the question on @xmath2 ellipticals even more controversial .",
    "after several small field surveys ( @xmath171 - 60 arcmin@xmath19 , see references in previous section ) leading to discrepant results , the most recent success was provided by a wide field survey for extremely red objects ( eros)@xcite . such a survey ( the widest so far : 700 arcmin@xmath19 to @xmath20 , with a sub - area of 447 arcmin@xmath19 to @xmath21 ) provided a complete sample of about 400 objects with @xmath22 suitable for reliably constraining the number density of high-@xmath4 elliptical candidates .",
    "the main results of such a survey are the detection of strong angular clustering of eros ( an order of magnitude larger than that of field galaxies ; see fig . 1 - 2 ) , and the accurate estimate of the surface density of elliptical candidates at @xmath2 .",
    "the observed clustering can explain the previous discrepant results on the surface density of @xmath2 ellipticals as due to strong field - to - field variations ( the `` cosmic variance '' ) , and it suggests that most eros are ellipticals rather than dust reddened starbursts ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "finally , even in the conservative case where up to 70% of eros are _ not _ ellipticals , the observed surface density ( complemented by the results of @xcite ) is in good agreement with the predictions of ple ( fig .",
    "3 ) , suggesting that most field ellipticals were fully assembled at least by @xmath23@xcite .",
    "this result does not imply that the formation of massive spheroidals occurred necessarily through a `` monolithic collapse '' scenario , but it simply constrains the epoch when the formation took place , and it implies that , if ellipticals formed through merging , this occurred mostly at @xmath24 .",
    "c    c    c    in addition to wide field imaging , the existence of galaxies with the colors expected in the case of passive evolution and with de vaucouleurs @xmath25 surface brightness profiles consistent with being dynamically relaxed spheroidals at @xmath2 has significantly grown thanks to hst deep imaging ( e.g @xcite ) .",
    "the spectroscopic confirmation of high-@xmath4 ellipticals is extremely challenging because of their faintness both in the optical and in the near - ir , and because of the few characteristic spectral features present in their spectra : mainly the strong 4000     continuum break , the weaker breaks at 2600   , 2900     and 3260   , and a handful of absorptions detectable with the present - day largest telescopes and very long integration times ( fig .",
    "moreover , for @xmath26 , the 4000     break falls in a critical spectral region where the optical and near - ir spectrographs are less efficient and the atmosphere severely hampers the observations .    despite such difficulties , the keck telescopes and",
    "the eso vlt are confirming the existence of @xmath2 passively evolving ellipticals with old ages ( @xmath27 gyr ) consistent with being formed at remote cosmological epochs@xcite ( fig .",
    "4(a ) ) , as well as ellipticals displaying a low level of star formation indicated by the possible detection of weak [ oii]@xmath283727 emission ( see fig .",
    "4(b ) ; see also@xcite )",
    "the major problem affecting the statistical studies of @xmath2 ellipticals is the `` pollution '' of color - selected samples by a fraction of star forming galaxies reddened by strong dust extinction@xcite .",
    "the fraction of dusty eros is currently unknown , but its accurate estimate is crucial to infer a reliable surface density of high-@xmath4 ellipticals `` cleaned '' by the contamination of dusty systems .",
    "this goal can be reached observing complete samples of eros with optical+near - ir spectroscopy ( when feasible ) , deep hst imaging and submm photometry . although based on small and/or incomplete samples , recent submm and hst observations suggested that the dusty galaxies are probably segregated among the reddest eros with @xmath29 or @xmath30@xcite .",
    "the other major problem in the identification of @xmath2 ellipticals is that a large fraction of eros are beyond the spectroscopic limits of the present largest telescopes ( e.g. @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) .",
    "this strongly limits our ability to spectroscopically confirm the nature of a high-@xmath4 elliptical candidate .",
    "the large binocular telescope will play an important role in the study of high-@xmath4 ellipticals . as a single - dish telescope , deep spectroscopy in the ranges 0.7 - 1.0@xmath33 m and 0.9 - 1.8@xmath33 m will be possible with the mods and the lucifer spectrographs respectively .",
    "this will allow us to enlarge the samples of spectroscopically identified high-@xmath4 ellipticals and , for instance , to infer their luminosity function and 3d clustering at @xmath2 . as a diffraction limited telescope",
    ", the lbt will provide high angular resolution near - ir images that will be crucial in deriving the surface brightness profiles and , for instance , to extend the kormendy relation and to attempt the tolman test at @xmath2 .",
    "finally , in case of objects unfeasible with spectroscopy , the combination of high resolution imaging and optical + near - ir photometry ( possibly done with _ special medium band _ filters ) will allow us first to confirm the spheroidal nature of the elliptical candidates , and then to reliably estimate their photometric redshifts .",
