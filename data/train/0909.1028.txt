    "a solar disturbance propagating away from the sun affects the pre - existing population of galactic cosmic rays ( gcrs ) in a number of ways .",
    "most well - known is the `` forbush decrease '' ( fd ) , a region of suppressed cosmic - ray density located downstream of an interplanetary coronal mass ejection ( icme ) shock .",
    "some particles from this region of suppressed density leak into the upstream region and , traveling nearly at the speed of light , they race ahead of the approaching shock and are observable as a precursory loss cone ( lc ) anisotropy far into the upstream region @xcite @xcite .",
    "lcs are characterized by intensity deficits confined to a narrow pitch - angle region around the sunward direction along the interplanetary magnetic field ( imf ) and are typically visible 4 - 8 hours ahead of shock arrival associated with major geomagnetic storms @xcite .",
    "on the basis of numerical simulations of the high - energy particle transport across the shock , @xcite[hereafter referred to as paper 1 ] derived the theoretical constraints for the lc anisotropy .",
    "in particular , they presented the quantitative relationship between the angular width of the pitch - angle distribution and the interplanetary parameters which include the angle between the shock normal and the upstream imf and the mean free path of the pitch - angle scattering of gcrs in the turbulent magnetic field . by analyzing the `` two - dimensional map '' of the cosmic ray intensity observed with a large single muon hodoscope during a lc precursor period in october , 2003 ,",
    "@xcite reported a lead time of 4.9 hours for the lc precursor indicating a mean free path of the pitch - angle scattering shorter than the theoretical expectation based on the numerical simulation .",
    "this implies that the imf was more turbulent in the event analyzed by them , than a typical power spectrum of the imf turbulence assumed in paper 1 .",
    "they also reported , on the other hand , a rather broad pitch - angle distribution for the event , which implies a `` quasi - parallel '' shock according to the numerical simulation .",
    "although this seemed to be conflicting with in - situ imf and plasma data suggesting a `` quasi - perpendicular '' shock , it was discussed that this apparent conflict can be resolved by taking account of a pair of shocks formed by icmes successively ejected from the sun .",
    "the `` alaska model '' simulation of the event indicated that a large shock responsible for the ssc at the earth was overtaking another smaller shock westward of the earth . during the loss cone period , therefore , it was possible that the earth may have been connected with the westward shock which was more consistent with a quasi - parallel geometry .",
    "thus , the situation of this event was rather complicated introducing an additional ambiguity in the comparison of the observation with theoretical predictions . in this paper , we analyze another simpler lc event associated with a single shock .",
    "cosmic ray precursors observed with a long lead time is of particular importance for the possible space weather forecast using cosmic ray measurements .",
    "an accurate measurement of such a precursor , however , requires detectors in a global network for continuous monitoring over a long time period more than a day prior to the ssc onset @xcite .",
    "such a network has been realized only recently by the global muon detector network ( gmdn ) @xcite . for accurate analyses of lc events , it is also necessary to properly remove the contribution from the diurnal anisotropy , which always exists in space with an amplitude comparable to the intensity deficit due to the lc anisotropy .",
    "the gmdn can also measure precisely the diurnal anisotropy utilizing the global sky coverage of the network @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we develop new analysis methods for removing the influence of the diurnal anisotropy and apply the `` two - dimensional map '' analysis by @xcite to the cosmic - ray precursors observed with the gmdn in december 2006 for better visualization of the signatures of cosmic ray precursors .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in  2 , we briefly summarize the features of the event which we analyze in this paper . in  3 , we apply a new analysis method to the data observed by the gmdn and present the best - fit analyses of a model based on the theoretical prediction by paper 1 .",
    "our conclusions and discussions based on the comparison with the theoretical prediction are given in  4 .",
    "an x3.4 flare was first observed at 02:14 ut on december 13 , 2006 and was followed by a halo coronal mass ejection ( cme ) eruption shortly after at 02:54 ut .",
    "this cme was accompanied by a strong interplanetary ( ip ) shock , which traveled interplanetary space with an average velocity of 1160 km / s and arrived at the earth causing the storm sudden commencement ( ssc ) onset at 14:14 ut on december 14 @xcite .",
    "the shock speed at 1 au was 1030 km / s as calculated from the conservation of the plasma mass across the shock .",
    "it was also derived from the rankine - hugoniot relations @xcite that the shock normal makes an angle of about 56@xmath1 with the upstream magnetic field indicating the quasi - perpendicular shock .",
    "an intense geomagnetic storm followed the ssc with peak kp index of 8 + .",
    "there was no other ssc and interplanetary disturbances recorded at the earth between 02:14 ut on december 13 and 14:14 ut on december 14 . from the data recorded by the gmdn",
    ", we routinely derive the anisotropy vector ( or the first order anisotropy ) by fitting the function @xmath2 given by @xmath3 to the pressure - corrected hourly count rate @xmath4 at universal time @xmath5 in the @xmath6-th directional channel of the @xmath7-th muon detector in the gmdn . in this equation",

    "satellite over three day period between december 13 and 15 , each as a function of time in the day of year ( doy ) on the horizontal axis .",
    "the left and right vertical solid lines indicate the flare onset and the ssc onset , respectively . a clear signature of the ip shock is seen in abrupt increases of the solar wind velocity and the imf magnitude following the ssc onset .",
    "the imf data observed during the period between the flare and ssc onsets show no signature of the imf sector boundary and indicate that the earth was in the `` toward '' sector throughout the period .",
    "figure 1c shows hourly values of the derived cosmic ray density ( @xmath9 ) , whereas figs.1d-1f display three anisotropy components ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) transformed to the geocentric solar ecliptic ( gse ) coordinate system .",
    "the anisotropy components shown in figs.1d-1f are corrected for both the solar wind convection anisotropy and the compton - getting anisotropy arising from the earth s 30 km / s orbital motion around the sun . in figure 1c , a fd is clearly observed with a @xmath03 % maximum depression of the cosmic ray density following the onset of the ssc as indicated by the vertical solid line .",
    "the average feature of the anisotropy components over the period preceding the ssc in figs.1d-1f indicates @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which is in a qualitative agreement with the drift model prediction for the anisotropy in the `` toward '' imf sector during the @xmath24 epoch of the solar polar magnetic field @xcite .    also plotted by black points in figure 1",
    "g is the pressure - corrected count rate recorded in the vertical channel of the so martinho da serra detector in brazil ( hereafter so martinho ) .",
    "it is evident in this panel that so martinho observed a sharp intensity decrease around doy 348.4 a few hours prior to the ssc onset indicating the lc precursor .",
    "we note in this figure that @xmath9 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are all changing in response to the lc precursor recorded by the so martinho detector .",
    "as shown later , the residual of the best - fitting is larger in two periods of 347.563- 347.771 and doys 348.271 - 348.563 , with the second period containing the lc signature in so martinho data in figure 1 g .",
    "this shows that the simple model in eq .",
    "( [ eq01 ] ) can not properly describe the lc anisotropy . in the next section ,",
    "we improve this model by taking account of the contribution from the lc anisotropy .    by using the _ ace _ imf data , we first examine the asymptotic viewing direction along the sunward imf in 24 hours prior to the ssc onset in december 14 , together with viewing directions ( after correction for geomagnetic bending ) available in the gmdn .",
    "although there is a large fluctuation in the imf orientation observed by _ ace _ , we find that the majority of the imf orientation is in the southern hemisphere , as expected for the sunward direction along the nominal parker field in the ecliptic plane viewed from the earth in december . the lc precursor , therefore , is expected to be observed in the directional channels viewing around the equator or a little south of the equator .",
    "this is consistent with the lc signature observed by so martinho in the bottom panel of figure 1 .",
    "our detailed analysis in the next section will show the lc precursor also observed by a small detector at hobart viewing the mid - latitude in the southern hemisphere . in the following analysis ,",
    "we use for calculating the pitch - angle of each viewing direction in the gmdn the nominal parker field calculated from the solar wind velocity by _ ace _",
    "@xcite , instead of using the _ ace _ imf , to avoid effects of the large fluctuation in the _ ace _ imf orientation .",
    "the anisotropy of @xmath030 gev gcr intensity observed with muon detectors is rather stable , changing only gradually even when the _ ace _ imf shows a large fluctuation .",
    "muon detectors measure high - energy gcrs by detecting secondary muons produced from the hadronic interactions of primary gcrs ( mostly protons ) with atmospheric nuclei .",
    "since relativistic muons have relatively long lifetimes ( the proper half - life being 2.2 @xmath25s ) and can reach the ground preserving the incident direction of the initiating primary particles , we can measure the gcr intensity in various directions with a multi - directional detector at a single location .",
    "the typical energy of primary gcrs modulated by fds is @xmath030 gev for muon detectors .",
    "the global muon detector network ( gmdn ) originally started with three detectors at nagoya ( japan ) , hobart ( australia ) and so martinho da serra ( brazil ) , each of which is multi - directional , thus allowing us to simultaneously record the muon intensities in various directions of viewing .",
    "these detectors have identical design , except for their detection area which is 36 m@xmath26 for nagoya , 9 m@xmath26 for hobart and 28 m@xmath26 for so martinho , consisting of two horizontal layers of plastic scintillators , vertically separated by 1.73 m , with an intermediate 5 cm layer of lead to absorb the soft component radiation in the air .",
    "each layer consists of an array of 1 m@xmath26 unit detectors , each with a 1 m@xmath271 m plastic scintillator viewed by a photomultiplier tube of 12.7 cm diameter . by counting pulses of the 2-fold coincidences between a pair of detectors on the upper and lower layers",
    ", we can record the rate of muons from the corresponding incident direction .",
    "the multi - directional muon telescope comprises various combinations between the upper and lower detectors .",
    "the field of view ( fov ) of the vertical channel has a broad geometrical aperture of @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "a precise measurement of lcs using muon detectors became possible only recently , when the gmdn capable of continuously monitoring the sunward imf direction was completed in march 2006 by adding another 9 m@xmath26 detector at kuwait university .",
    "unlike the other three detectors , the kuwait muon telescope ( hereafter kuwait ) consists of four horizontal layers of 30 proportional counter tubes ( pcts ) .",
    "each pct is a 5 m long cylinder with a 10 cm diameter having a 50-micron thick tungsten anode along the cylinder axis .",
    "a 5 cm layer of lead is installed above the detector to absorb the soft component radiation .",
    "the pct axes are aligned geographic east - west ( x ) in the top and third layers and north - south ( y ) in the second and bottom layers .",
    "the top and second layers form an upper pair , while the third and bottom layers form a lower pair .",
    "the two pairs are separated vertically by 80 cm .",
    "muon recording is triggered by the fourfold coincidence of pulses from all layers and the incident direction is identified from x - y locations of the upper and lower pct pairs .",
    "this is approximately equivalent to recording muons with two 30@xmath2730 square arrays of 10 cm@xmath2710 cm detectors separated vertically by 80 cm .",
    "the geometrical aperture of the fov in this detector is @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) for the vertical channel .",
    "the muon count is recorded in each of 23@xmath2723=529 directional channels which cover 360@xmath1 of azimuth angle and 0@xmath1 to 60@xmath1 zenith ( for more detail of gmdn , see * ? ? ?",
    "the number of viewing directions available from the gmdn was drastically increased from the conventional one by installing a new recording system using the field programmable gate arrays ( fpgas ) , with which we can count muons for all possible coincidences between a pair of unit detectors on the upper and lower layers @xcite . if we have a square @xmath33 array of unit detectors aligned to the north - south ( or east - west ) direction in the @xmath7-th muon detector , it is possible to analyze the pressure corrected muon rates @xmath34 in total @xmath35 directional channels at the time @xmath5 , where positive ( negative ) @xmath36 and @xmath37 represent eastern ( western ) and northern ( southern ) incidence , respectively , with @xmath38 corresponding to the vertical incident . in",
    "order to visualize the directional distribution of gcr intensity , we plot @xmath39 as a function of @xmath36 and @xmath37 in a color - coded format , which we call the `` 2d map '' ( two dimensional map of the cosmic ray intensity ) .",
    "the number of directional channels used in this paper is 25 ( 5@xmath275 ) from hobart , 121 ( 11@xmath2711 ) from kuwait and 49 ( 7@xmath277 ) from so martinho , respectively .",
    "we can not apply this technique to nagoya data in this paper , as the fpga recording system was installed in the nagoya detector only in may , 2007 and not available for the fd event in december 2006 .",
    "in this paper , therefore , we analyze only the conventional 17 direction data from nagoya ( for the conventional directional channels in the gmdn , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , the total number of the directional channels analyzed in this paper is 212 from four detector systems in the gmdn .",
    "as stated in  1 , we need to accurately remove from the data the contribution from the diurnal anisotropy ( da ) for precise analysis of the lc precursor .",
    "this was not possible for us before completing the gmdn with which we can precisely measure the da utilizing the global sky coverage of the network . by using the 24-hour trailing moving averages ( tmas ) of @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 in eq .",

    "are displayed by solid circles , a gray curve and open circles , respectively .",
    "it is seen that the gradual variation of @xmath39 due to the da ( @xmath55 ) is successfully removed in @xmath53 .",
    "we have calculated using 8-hour and 12-hour tmas for @xmath52 instead of 24-hour tma and have confirmed that the results remain essentially unchanged .",
    "note that @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ eq07 ] ) is derived using the `` trailing '' average and is not affected by the variation occurring after @xmath5 .",
    "this is an important issue for possible real time forecasting .    to visualize the lc signature more clearly by suppressing statistical fluctuation which is larger in the inclined channels , we also use , instead of @xmath53 , the `` significance '' @xmath56 defined as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the count rate error for the @xmath59 directional channel in the @xmath7-th detector .",
    "figure 2a shows the 2d maps of @xmath60 in eq .",
    "( [ eq08 ] ) for so martinho on december 13 and 14 during 36 hours preceding the ssc onset at 14:14 ut on december 14 ( doy 348.593 ) , whereas figure 2c shows @xmath60 for hobart in the same period .",
    "each small square panel in these figures displays @xmath60 observed in one hour in a color - coded format as a function of @xmath36 and @xmath37 on the horizontal and vertical axes denoting the east - west and north - south inclinations of the viewing direction , respectively .",
    "red color denotes the excess intensity in each ( @xmath61 ) pixel relative to the ominidirectional intensity in an entire fov , while blue color denotes the deficit intensity . in these figures , we set color scales ranging @xmath62 5 for so martinho and @xmath62 3 for hobart taking account of larger statistical error in hobart due to its smaller detection area .",

    "it is seen that the zero pitch - angle region is first captured in the fov by so martinho in doys 347.354 - 347.563 ( 08:00 - 13:00 ut , december 13 ) , and then by hobart in doys 347.771 - 347.979 ( 18:00 - 23:00 ut , december 13 ) and by so martinho again in doys 348.354 - 348.563 ( 08:00 - 13:00 ut , december 14 ) according to the earth s spin .",
    "hereafter , these three 6-hour periods are referred to as the lc periods . in figure 2a for so martinho",
    ", there is a clear lc precursor seen as a deficit intensity at around @xmath64 pitch - angle with the minimum intensity about -0.8 % in doys 348.396@xmath0348.521 ( 09:00@xmath012:00 ut on december 14 ) during one of the lc periods .",
    "a striking feature of this event is that a weaker lc signature is also seen one day earlier in doys 347.437@xmath0347.521 ( 10:00@xmath012:00 ut on december 13 ) during another lc period .",
    "this suggests that the lc precursor already existed only 7 hours after the cme eruption at 02:54 ut on december 13 , when the ip shock driven by an icme located at 0.4 au from the sun @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , the signature also should have been observed during a period in between these two lc periods by other detectors viewing the eastern sky neighboring the fov of so martinho .",

    ", a weak lc signature is also seen in figure 2e for kuwait viewing the sky in between the fovs of so martinho and hobart .",
    "it is rather surprising that the lc signature passing along the southern edge of the fov of kuwait can be seen even with such a small detector ( thanks to a better directional resolution of the muon hodoscope ) .",
    "we add to note that a large muon hodoscope grapes-3 in operation at ooty in southern india also recorded a clear lc precursor on @xmath009:00 lt ( 03:30 ut ) in december 14 , just before the signature recorded in kuwait in figure 2e @xcite[dr .",
    "h. kojima , private communication ] .",
    "these all give observational supports for the picture that the lc signature was continuously existing and was successively observed with the multiple detectors in the gmdn according to the earth s spin .",

    "such an intensity excess is expected from the ground based measurement of gcrs reflected by the ip shock approaching the earth @xcite .",
    "the numerical model for gcr transport across the shock also predicts such an ex anisotropy superposed on the lc distribution ( paper 1 ) .",
    "the fractional energy gain for a gcr traveling along the imf with an energy @xmath67 after the reflection by the ip shock approaching with a velocity @xmath68 is calculated as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the angle between the shock normal and the upstream imf and @xmath71 is the speed of light .",

    "a sharp lc around @xmath76 ( zero pitch - angle ) and a broad excess intensity around @xmath77 ( @xmath78 pitch - angle ) are both evident in this figure .",

    "this parallel anisotropy shows the maximum deviation of @xmath01 % at the ssc onset which is consistent with the expectation from the measurement of the shock reflected particles as discussed in eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "we finally note the density ( @xmath111 ) also showing a positive deviation similar to the parallel anisotropy .",
    "the maximum deviation is @xmath01 % at 0 hour from the ssc and is almost the same as the maximum deviation of the parallel anisotropy , giving a support to our model function of the ex anisotropy in eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) , wherein the second term of the right hand side contains two terms independent and dependent on the pitch - angle ( @xmath81 ) with the same amplitude at @xmath116 . in the next section , we will compare these best - fit parameters with the theoretical predictions by paper 1 and discuss their physical implications .",
    "we have analyzed cosmic ray precursors of a forbush decrease ( fd ) observed on december 2006 with the gmdn monitoring the directional intensity of @xmath050 gev galactic cosmic rays .",
    "this forbush decrease was caused by an ip shock associated with a cme which erupted from the sun shortly after an x3.4 flare on december 13 and arrived at the earth in december 14 .",
    "an intense geomagnetic storm was also recorded during this fd with the peak kp index of 8 + .",
    "there was no other ssc and/or interplanetary disturbances recorded at the earth during a period between the onsets of the flare and the ssc , which is analyzed in this paper . by using the 2d maps of the cosmic ray intensity produced by removing the contribution from the diurnal anisotropy",
    ", we found a clear signature of the lc anisotropy which was observed as a deficit intensity from the sunward imf direction .",
    "the significant lc signature was first recorded by hobart at @xmath117 hours before the ssc and then by so martinho with a larger amplitude at @xmath110 hours .",
    "a weak lc signature was also seen in kuwait viewing the sky in between fovs of hobart and so martinho .",
    "the `` half - width '' opening angle @xmath118 of the lc is defined in paper 1 as the pitch - angle at which the intensity decrease ( relative to the omnidirectional intensity ) has reached half its maximum value . according to this definition , @xmath118 is calculated to be @xmath119 using @xmath106 obtained in  3.2 . by linearly interpolating the numerical relationship between the loss - cone width ( @xmath118 ) and the angle between the shock normal and the upstream magnetic field ( @xmath70 ) given by paper 1 ( see table 2 in paper 1 ) , we find @xmath120 corresponding to @xmath121 assuming the `` local '' slope of the power spectrum of the imf turbulence ( @xmath122 ) appropriate for the muon detector . this @xmath70 is less than half of @xmath123 obtained by @xcite(see  2 ) .",
    "one possible source of this discrepancy is that a large error might associate with the non - linear best - fit parameter @xmath87 obtained in  3.2 .",
    "if we evaluate the error by calculating @xmath87 with which @xmath124 reaches at @xmath125 , that is , + 1.0 more than @xmath124 with minimum @xmath99 , @xmath87 with the error is estimated to be @xmath126 which corresponds to @xmath127 .",
    "this @xmath70 with a large error is not inconsistent with @xmath123 by @xcite .",
    "we are not sure whether this error estimation is appropriate or not , but we also carried out the best - fit calculation in  3.2 with @xmath87 fixed at 23@xmath1 corresponding to @xmath123 and confirmed that the minimum residual @xmath99 and the best - fit parameters except @xmath87 are almost unchanged from those in figure 4 .",
    "the reproduced 2d maps were also very similar to those in figs.2b , 2d and 2f .",
    "this implies that @xmath70 can not be determined accurately by the present analysis method for the gmdn data .",
    "one reason for such a large error in @xmath70 ( or @xmath87 ) is the poor angular resolution of the observed incident direction in detectors ( hobart and so martinho ) with which the lc anisotropy was recorded .",
    "this is different from another lc event on october 2003 which was observed with a large muon hodoscope with the better angular resolution @xcite .",
    "it is also noted that the dependence of @xmath118 ( i.e. @xmath87 ) on @xmath70 becomes very small for @xmath70 above @xmath128 according to paper 1 .",
    "this means that one has to measure @xmath87 very accurately for precisely determining @xmath70 particularly when @xmath70 is large in case of the quasi - perpendicular shock .",
    "a striking feature of this event is that a weak lc signature was also recorded by so martinho more than a day earlier on december 13 at @xmath129 hours . to examine the lead time of this lc precursor",
    ", we fit to @xmath83 in figure 4b an exponential function of time @xmath5 ( measured from the ssc ) defined as , @xmath130 and obtain @xmath131 % and @xmath132 hours . for this fitting , we used only @xmath83 obtained when the zero pitch - angle is monitored by the gmdn ( as displayed by solid circles in figure 4b ) .",
    "this lead time @xmath133 for 30 gev particles corresponds to the `` decay length '' @xmath37 of the lc , as @xmath134 with @xmath135 and @xmath136 km / s @xcite . by using a ratio @xmath137 derived for @xmath122 and @xmath138 from interpolating table 2 in paper 1 , we estimate the parallel mean free path for the pitch - angle scattering ( @xmath139 ) to be @xmath02.6 au , which is almost two times longer than 1.5 au estimated by paper 1 for the muon detector .",
    "this indicates that the imf was more quiet in this event than a typical power spectrum assumed for the imf turbulence by paper 1 . these conclusions with @xmath122",
    "remain unchanged even if we choose @xmath140 , with which we get @xmath141 , @xmath142 au and @xmath143 au .",
    "we have also found the excess intensity from the sunward imf direction clearly observed during @xmath010 hours preceding the ssc .",
    "we have shown that this excess intensity is consistent with the measurement of the particles accelerated by the head - on collisions with the approaching shock .",
    "this is the first detailed observation of the precursor due to the shock reflected particles with muon detectors .",
    "it is interesting to note that there is also an enhancement seen in the anisotropy perpendicular to the imf in figure 4h .",
    "we think that this perpendicular anisotropy is probably arising from the drift anisotropy expressed by the vector product between the imf and the spatial gradient of the cosmic ray density , which directs toward the shock due to the higher population of the reflected particles at the shock . by using the observed perpendicular anisotropy together with the imf data , therefore",
    ", we can deduce the temporal variation of the cosmic - ray density gradient and infer the geometry of the ip shock . in our separate papers , we actually succeeded in deriving the geometry of the magnetic flux rope in icmes by this method @xcite .",
    "the precursor observed with the long lead time , like the event analyzed in this paper , is of particular importance for the possible space weather forecast using cosmic ray measurements .",
    "for the accurate observation of such event , however , we need further improvement of the gmdn .",
    "first , the incomplete sky - coverage of the gmdn allowed us to analyze the best - fit parameters during only half a period in figure 4 , when the sunward imf direction was in the fov of the gmdn .",
    "second , the insufficient detection areas of hobart and kuwait increased the statistical error and introduced a non - uniformity into the response of the gmdn to the lc precursor .",
    "we believe that such a non - uniform response also contributes to the large fluctuations in the best - fit parameters in figure 4 .",
    "we are now planning to overcome these technical problems by expanding the detection areas of hobart and kuwait and also by installing new detector(s ) to expand the fov of the gmdn preparing for the next solar maximum expected at around the year 2013 .",

    "the observations with the kuwait muon telescope are supported by the kuwait university grant sp03/03 .",
