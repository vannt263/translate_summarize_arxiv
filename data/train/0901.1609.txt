    "large underdense regions in the universe , commonly known as voids , are a very relevant signature of the large - scale structure of the universe ( lss ) . not until recently have they drawn too much attention from both observational and theoretical sides .",
    "however , it is becoming more evident that voids play an important role as cosmological probes and in understanding the processes involved in galaxy formation ( peebles 2001 ; plionis & basilakos 2002 ; hoyle et al . 2005 ; conroy et al . 2005 ; patiri et al .",

    "2006 ; park & lee 2007 ; croton & farrar 2008 ; tinker et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "voids occupy large areas projected into the sky , and only recently galaxy redshift surveys have become large enough to allow systematic and robust studies of void statistics ( see e.g. croton et al .",
    "2004 ; hoyle & vogeley 2004 ; patiri et al .",
    "2006 ; ceccarelli et al .",
    "2006 for analysis of voids in the 2df and tinker et al .",
    "2008 in the sdss ) . on the theoretical side ,",
    "important progress has been made recently by improving analytical and numerical simulation modelling of voids ( mathis & white 2002 ; gottlber et al .",
    "2003 ; colberg et al .",
    "2005 for numerical simulations , sheth & van de weygaert 2004 ; patiri , betancort - rijo & prada 2006 , hereafter pbp06 , for analytical approaches ) .",
    "most of the recent efforts concerning the statistics of voids have been focused on constraining different aspects of the formation and evolution of structure in the universe rather than on assessing their ability to restrict cosmological parameters .",
    "the statistic of voids can , in principle , be used to put constraints to any cosmological parameters .",
    "however , these statistics may be especially sensitive to some of them .",
    "for instance , the abundance of voids larger than a given radius depends on the normalization of the linear spectrum of mass fluctuations ( noted as @xmath6 ) .",
    "furthermore , the abundance of voids as a function of their radius depends on the shape of the spectrum ( usually denoted as @xmath7 ) .",
    "although these dependencies arise naturally from the current picture of structure formation , we must note that it has been difficult to prove them ( see little & weinberg 1994 ; tinker , weinberg & warren 2006 ) .",
    "we argue that this might be due to the specific way how the galaxies are distributed within dark matter halos . in previous works , halo occupation distribution ( hod ) and its variants",
    "have been used to model de distribution of galaxies within halos . in these methods ,",
    "the models are fitted ( for a given @xmath4 , for instance ) to reproduce the projected two - point correlation function , which renders very similar void statistics , resulting in an insensitivity of the void statistics with @xmath4 ( e.g. tinker , weinberg & warren 2006 ) .",
    "also , the limited size of simulation boxes used in previous works could be an issue .",
    "note that the most widely used void statistics to test these assumptions has been the so - called void probability function ( vpf ) .",
    "however , it has large sampling errors , and may be not the most efficient statistic , being other statistics like the number of voids _ larger _ than a given radius a more appropriate approach ( plionis & basilakos 2002 ; pbp06 ) .    computing accurate predictions of void statistics for different cosmological parameters is not a simple task .",
    "the options are running a large suite of numerical simulations , for different sets of cosmological parameters , with enough volume to obtain a reliable void statistics or develop an analytical framework to predict the dependence of statistics of voids with cosmological parameters . as the former involves a major consumption of computing power in order to achieve the needed accuracy , in this paper we focus our effort on the latter approach . in pbp06",
    "we already developed an analytical framework to obtain the number densities of voids larger than a given radius defined by dark matter halos in a @xmath8cdm   cosmology .",
    "based on our previous work , we present here an extension to that formalism in order to compare model predictions with observational void statistics in a homogeneous way , and consequently , be able to extract cosmological information .",
    "the extension we refer to is done in two aspects .",
    "first of all , the relationship between the vpf and the number density of voids , which was determined in pbp06 only for the largest void limit ( for a given number density of dark matter halos ) , is extended here to deal also with smaller voids .",
    "in addition , the analytical expression to compute the vpf of dark matter halos itself was improved .",
    "secondly , we modified our formalism so that we can now compute directly the predictions for the number of voids larger than a given radius _ observed _ within a given volume ( i.e. taking into account the redshift distortions and the selection effects of a given survey ) .",
    "currently , there are several methods and experiments devoted to constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "cmb experiments such as wmap ( hinshaw et al . 2008 ; komatsu et al .",
    "2008 ) in combination with galaxy clustering information ( e.g. sanchez et al . 2006 ; seljak et al .",
    "2006 ) have provided the best constrains to date .",
    "methods based on clusters of galaxies and lensing are also promising ( e.g. bahcall et al . 2003 ; wang et al .",
    "2003 ; yoo et al . 2006 ; vikhlinin et al .",
    "however , as all methods have limitations and even degeneracies in some parameters , it is essential to provide independent parameter estimations in order to improve the accuracy of the combined measurements . as mentioned above",
    ", voids might be specially interesting to measure some cosmological parameters , such as the normalization of the amplitude of density fluctuations since they are tracing comparable scales .",
    "the necessary steps to achieve the goal of using the statistics of voids to constrain cosmological parameters are presented as follows : in section 2 we present the new relationship between the number density of voids [ @xmath9 and the vpf [ denoted as @xmath10 . in section 3 we show how to obtain the vpf and other statistics for galaxy distributions , discussing the relationship between dark matter halos and galaxies . in section 4 we extend our formalism in order to compute voids statistics in redshift space . in section 5",
    "we discuss the dependence of voids statistics on redshift and cosmological parameters ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 in particular ) . in section 6",
    "we show how to handle in the theoretical calculations several observational effects that perturb the statistics of voids , namely the effect of the finite sample , the spectroscopic completeness and the variations of the void statistics with redshift ( i.e. the _ snapshot _ effect ) . in section 7",
    "we propose different tests for measuring cosmological parameters using void statistics . in section 8",
    "we present a comparison of results obtained using our formalism with those found in numerical simulations ( millennium run ) .",
    "finally , in section 9 we present the discussion and conclusions .",
    "the most common , widely used void statistic is the so - called void probability function ( vpf , white 1979 ) , which is the probability that a randomly placed sphere with radius @xmath13 is empty of objects ( galaxies or dark matter halos ) .",
    "another important statistic is the number density of voids ( defined as maximal non - overlapping spheres ) larger than a given radius @xmath13 .",
    "several works have established the relationship between these two statistics ( see e.g. otto et al .",
    "1986 ; betancort - rijo 1990 ; pbp06 ) .",
    "however , they are only valid for rare voids , i.e. the largest voids in a given sample .",
    "in pbp06 we argued that most of the information carried by void statistics , concerning cosmological parameters , comes from rare voids .",
    "however , as we will see below , more common voids are still relevant to increase the statistics , which is fundamental to constrain cosmological parameters reliably . in order to take into account more common voids , the analytical relationships mentioned above have to be improved .",
    "in pbp06 we showed that the vpf [ that we denote here as @xmath14 is related to the number density of voids larger than a radius @xmath13 [ @xmath15 by the following expression ( for the rare voids limit ) :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the mean density of points in the surface of a randomly chosen empty sphere with radius @xmath13 , that we denote in term of the derivative of @xmath19 with respect to @xmath13 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : eq1 ] ) gives an unique functional relationship between @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "as mentioned above , this works well for rare voids , but for more common voids the existence of a unique functional relationship has to be studied . note that the vpf is determined by all the hierarchy of correlations functions ( white 1979 ) , but the vpf itself do not determine uniquely all these correlations .",
    "for instance , two samples could have the same vpf and still differ in some aspect of the clustering , which will render different number densities of voids larger than a given radius . to address this issue we carried out a detailed analysis using the millennium run numerical simulation ( springel et al .",
    "2005 ; see section [ res ] ) .",
    "we found evidence for an unique functional form of the vpf for the distributions relevant to this work .",
    "we write this expression as an extension of the relationship given in equation ( [ eq : eq1 ] ) , i.e.    @xmath21 } \\label{eq : eq3}\\ ] ]    and @xmath22 these equations are valid for @xmath23 , while for @xmath24 @xmath25 .",
    "the quantity @xmath26 measures the rareness of the voids . in the rare void limit @xmath26 goes to zero , so the exponential factor is close to one , recovering the original equation ( [ eq : eq1 ] ) .",
    "note also that the coefficient @xmath27 shown in equation ( [ eq : eq1 ] ) is replaced by 0.68 in equation ( [ eq : eq3 ] ) .",
    "the former coefficient was originally introduced by preskill & politzer ( 1986 ) , but we found the latter to be more accurate ( betancort - rijo , in preparation ) .    in the limit in which @xmath26 goes to zero , all voids larger than @xmath13 are only slightly larger than @xmath13 , so that their mean volume , @xmath28 , is only slightly larger than @xmath29",
    ". thus , using equation ( [ eq : eq4 ] ) we have for the fraction of volume occupied by voids , @xmath30 :    @xmath31     + for @xmath26 less than 0.1 , @xmath30 is smaller than 0.07 and so the voids can be considered rare . for these voids exponential factor in equation ( [ eq : eq3 ] ) differs less than a 10% from 1 so that the asymptotic expression [ eq . ( [ eq : eq1 ] ) with the adequate coefficients ] is a good approximation . as @xmath26 increases , the exponential factor decreases , reaching a minimum at @xmath32 . here",
    ", the exponential part takes a value close to 2/3 . for @xmath33 ,",
    "the exponential factor increases again , recovering the value of 1 for @xmath34 .",
    "note that this corresponds to rather common voids occupying more than one third of the volume of the sample .",
    "further , for very commom voids @xmath20 is practically independent of @xmath26 . in this limit",
    "the problem degenerates into a problem of random packing of spheres of unequal radius ( see e.g. shi & zhang 2008 ) , which is far beyond the scope of this work ( it is worth to mention , however , that equation ( [ eq : eq3 ] ) provides a reasonably good approximation even in this limit , although it have carefully been checked only for @xmath35 . ) to compute @xmath19 we start from a more general statistic that is @xmath36 .",
    "this denotes the probability that a sphere of radius @xmath13 , placed at random within the distribution , contains @xmath37 objects ( layzer 1954 ) .",
    "note that for small values of @xmath37 , @xmath36 is still characterizing underdense regions .",
    "as we will see , this statistic is very important for our purposes . for point distributions conforming to a random , non - uniform poissonian process ( peebles 1980 ) we have that    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the probability distribution for the integral of the probability density , @xmath40 , within a randomly placed sphere . in pbp06",
    "we showed that for dark matter halos , @xmath40 can be written as :    @xmath41[1+\\delta_{ns } ]   \\label{eq : eq7}\\ ] ]    where @xmath42 denotes the mean number density of those halos in the sample ( usually halos larger than some given mass ) .",
    "@xmath43 is the volume of the sphere .",
    "@xmath44 is the actual enclosed density contrast within the sphere .",
    "the first term in the right hand side of the equation is the integral of the probability density within the sphere for halos tracing the mass ( i.e. no bias , which is true in the very low mass limit ) . in general , halos are biased tracers of the underlying mass distribution , due to the initial clustering of the proto - halos before they move along with mass ( i.e. the statistical clustering ) . the second term of the equation accounts for this biasing .",
    "in pbp06 we obtained an approximation for this bias as a function of the linear enclosed density contrast within the sphere ( @xmath45 ) written as :    @xmath46    where @xmath47 , @xmath48 are coefficients mainly depending on the halo mass , and to a lesser extent , on the size of the sphere ( see rubio - martin et al .",
    "we use the complete zeldovich approximation ( cza , betancort - rijo & lpez - corredoira 2001 ) to obtain the actual enclosed density contrast ( @xmath44 ) , as a function of the eigenvalues of the linear deformation tensor , @xmath49 , and since @xmath50 , we can write @xmath40 as a function of the @xmath49 values . equation ( [ eq : eq6 ] ) can be then written as :    @xmath51^n}{n ! } \\times \\nonumber\\\\ \\times e^{[-u(\\lambda_i ) ] } d\\lambda_1d\\lambda_2d\\lambda_3   \\label{eq : eq9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath52 is the probability distribution for the @xmath53 within a sphere of radius @xmath13 chosen at random in eulerian space ( more precisely , the @xmath49 values on the lagrangian patches that transform into that sphere ) .",
    "betancort - rijo & lopez - corredoira ( 2002 ) showed that @xmath54 can be derived from the probability distribution for the @xmath49 within a sphere of constant lagrangian radius @xmath55 chosen at random in lagrangian space ( doroshkevich 1970 ) .",
    "note that in this last equation a triple integral is involved .",
    "however , in the cases we are interested in [ i.e. where @xmath37 is rather smaller than the mean @xmath56 , this equation can be approximated without loss of accuracy by an equation involving only one integral :    @xmath57^n}{n!}e^{[-u(\\delta_l ) ] } d\\delta_l    \\label{eq : eq10}\\ ] ]    where @xmath58 is now a function of @xmath45 ( and implicitly of @xmath13 ) through the dependence of the actual density contrast , @xmath44 , on its linear counterpart , @xmath59 .",
    "we write this functional dependence as    @xmath60)[1+\\delta_{ns}(\\delta_l ) ] .",
    "\\label{eq : eq11}\\ ] ]    @xmath61 is basically the relationship between the actual and the linear density contrast within a sphere as given by the standard spherical collapse model , except for a small correcting term depending on @xmath13 ( see eq .",
    "a3 in appendix a ) .",
    "note that in pbp06 we did not use this correcting term , so the values of @xmath62 obtained there have a small but non - negligible error .",
    "@xmath63 is the probability distribution for the linear density contrast within a sphere chosen at random in eulerian space .",
    "see appendix a for details on how to efficiently evaluate equation ( [ eq : eq10 ] ) .    in pbp06 we argued whether halo clustering conform exactly to a random poissonian model .",
    "in this model , objects are placed in the distribution accordingly to an underlying probability density field , but independently of the actual position of the placed points .",
    "in fact , halos have an exclusion region around them that can not be accounted for within that model .",
    "however , we do not detect a deviation from the poissonian model .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that at least in these underdense environments the mean distance between halos is much larger than the mentioned exclusion region ( see also conroy et al .",
    "in the previous section we described how to compute predictions for the number density of voids defined by dark matter halos .",
    "however , we do observe galaxies , which are assumed to be embedded in those dark matter halos .",
    "hence , we need to establish a relationship between them in order to obtain @xmath36 for galaxy distributions and then be able to compare model predictions with observations .    from equation ( [ eq : eq10 ] )",
    "we see that the relationship between halos and galaxies enters only through @xmath64 , which quantifies the biasing of the galaxies with respect to the underlying matter distribution .",
    "we denote the function carrying the biasing for galaxies as @xmath65 .",
    "this function is determined by the @xmath64 for halos through the relationship of galaxies with halos . the general equation to compute @xmath36 for a galaxy distribution",
    "can be written in a similar way than equation ( [ eq : eq10 ] ) , but replacing @xmath64 by @xmath65 . in pbp06 we found",
    "( see also yang et al .",
    "2003 ) that    @xmath66    here , @xmath67 is the conditional mass function within a region with linear density fluctuation @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath68 is the cumulative conditional luminosity function and @xmath69 is the unconditional one .",
    "it is worth to mention that in this equation we allow for a dependence of the conditional luminosity on the environmental density through @xmath45 .",
    "however , there is an increasing evidence favoring a conditional luminosity not depending on environment for a large range of luminosities ( see tinker et al .",
    "2008 ; tinker & conroy 2008 ) .",
    "given the conditional luminosity function , @xmath68 , equation ( [ eq : eq12 ] ) can be used to obtain @xmath65 as a function of @xmath45 .",
    "however , this is neither simple nor straightforward . here",
    ", we prefer to determine a functional form from general considerations and calibrate it with numerical simulations . we know that for halos above any given mass the dependence of @xmath70 on @xmath45 is accurately fitted by a gaussian ( equation [ [ eq : eq8 ] ] )",
    "this implies that @xmath71 have to be well approximated by a gaussian for halos with mass within any mass interval .",
    "now , in equation ( [ eq : eq12 ] ) we see that @xmath72 is the average of the value of @xmath71 over all halo masses ( weighted by the probability distribution for the mass of a halo containing a galaxy with luminosity larger than @xmath73 ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath72 must be approximated by a gaussian with an accuracy comparable to the accuracy of the approximation of @xmath72 by gaussians within the relevant range of mass values .",
    "then we can write :    @xmath74    where @xmath75 , @xmath76 are the same functions @xmath77 defined in equation ( [ eq : eq8 ] ) evaluated at mass @xmath78 . equation ( [ eq : eq13 ] )",
    "means that the biasing of galaxies with luminosity larger than @xmath73 with respect to the underlying mass distribution is equal to the biasing of the halos with mass larger than @xmath78 .",
    "let @xmath79 be the mass such that the number density of all halos with mass larger than @xmath79 is equal to the number density of the galaxies under consideration , @xmath42 , i.e. @xmath80 [ where @xmath81 is the cumulative cosmic mass function ] .",
    "the relationship between @xmath78 and @xmath79 is given by :    @xmath82    where @xmath83 is the _ rms _ linear density fluctuation on scale @xmath79 .",
    "for very large masses @xmath84 and @xmath78 is very close to @xmath79 , but for masses with @xmath85 , @xmath78 may be substantially larger than @xmath79 . note that @xmath78 is not the mass ( lower limit ) of the halos containing the galaxies under consideration , but the mass such that the clustering properties of the galaxies is equal to that of all halos more massive than @xmath78 .",
    "the form of equation ( [ eq : eq14 ] ) , where @xmath86 depends only on @xmath83 is what is expected if the clustering of the galaxies under consideration is determined only by the process of gravitational hierarchical collapse .",
    "the specifics of the galaxy formation processes are not relevant in as much as equation ( [ eq : eq13 ] ) is a good approximation .",
    "the number density of galaxies of a given type above a given luminosity does strongly depends on those specifics , but the relationship between the number density ( which gives m ) and the clustering ( given by @xmath78 ) does not .    equation ( [ eq : eq13 ] ) is the result of fitting a functional form derived from general considerations to the results of the numerical simulations described in section [ res ] .",
    "it must be noted , however , that the values of @xmath87 used in fitting equation ( [ eq : eq13 ] ) only goes from 1.6 to 2.6 , which is enough for the masses and redshifts relevant to our present problem .",
    "further tests must be imposed on this equation before extrapolating it far beyond the well checked range of @xmath87 values .    in summary , to obtain the voids statistics for galaxies brighter than a given luminosity , we use equation ( [ eq : eq10 ] ) with @xmath71 equal to that of halos larger than a certain mass @xmath88 , which is determined by the number density of the galaxies .",
    "the equation given in the previous section for @xmath36 corresponds to voids in real space . however , galaxy positions provided by redshift surveys are in redshift space . in patiri",
    "et al . ( 2006 ) we introduced a method based on the standard spherical collapse model to transform to real space , one - by - one , the voids found in the 2df galaxy redshift survey . in the present work we will use a similar method . however ,",
    "instead of transforming the observed statistic we will modify our equations in order to compute the model predictions directly in redshift space , which is more straightforward .    in the spherical expansion model the peculiar velocity of matter at distance @xmath13 from the center of a sphere with actual enclosed density contrast @xmath89",
    "is given by :    @xmath90 \\label{eq : eq15}\\ ] ]    where @xmath91 is hubble constant and @xmath92 $ ] is a unique function of the enclosed density contrast ( for a specific cosmology , see appendix a ) . the matter distribution within a maximal sphere ( i.e. , our definition of voids ) is not exactly spherically symmetric , and outside that sphere the distribution of matter in scales much smaller and much larger than the radius is strongly non - spherical .",
    "however , the average velocity field around that sphere [ over all voids with given @xmath13 , @xmath89 ] is described well by the standard spherical collapse model .",
    "this mean velocity field play a key role in transforming the statistics under consideration from real to redshift space .",
    "a sphere with radius @xmath13 in real space and with inner mean fractional density @xmath44 has a mean outflow in its surface given by equation ( [ eq : eq15 ] ) . in redshift space , that sphere transforms into a prolate spheroid elongated along the line of sight .",

    "this result is exact for any value of @xmath92 $ ] .",
    "conversely , for small values of @xmath92 $ ] , a sphere with radius @xmath97 in redshift space is approximately transformed into an oblate spheroid in real space with the smallest semiaxes , @xmath98 , along the line of sight .",
    "this semiaxes is related to @xmath97 by :    @xmath99)^{-1 }   \\label{eq : eq17}\\ ] ]    and @xmath100 now , in equation ( [ eq : eq10 ] ) the dependence on @xmath13 enters through @xmath63 and through @xmath101 ( a small dependence ) and in both of this quantities ( see appendix a ) @xmath13 enters through @xmath102 ( the @xmath103 of the linear enclosed density contrast within a lagrangian sphere with radius @xmath55 ) . the relevant value of @xmath55 here is @xmath104^{1/3}$ ] .",
    "thus , in equation ( [ eq : eq10 ] ) the radius @xmath13 enters in the combination @xmath105^{1/3})$ ] . in this equation",
    ", @xmath13 is the radius of a sphere in real space , but as we want the @xmath106 on redshift space , the relevant body in real space , is no longer a sphere but an spheroid .",
    "the relevant @xmath102 must now be evaluated within an spheroid .",
    "however , betancort - rijo & lopez - corredoira ( 2002 ) showed that for spheroids not differing much from spheres @xmath87 is almost independent of the form of the spheroid , depending only on its volume .",
    "thus , we may use for @xmath13 the radius of a sphere with the same volume as the spheroid , which is given by    @xmath107)^{-1/3 }   \\label{eq : eq19}\\ ] ]    to obtain @xmath108 in redsift space , that we represent by @xmath109 , within this approximation , we may use equation ( [ eq : eq10 ] ) with the following replacement :    @xmath110 \\rightarrow [ 1+\\delta(\\delta_{l},r)][1+{\\rm vel}(\\delta_{l } ) ]   \\label{eq : eq20}\\ ] ]     + the reason for this replacement is that the procedure followed to obtain equation ( [ eq : eq10 ] ) , which corresponds to real space can also be followed in redshift space . the only difference with real space",
    "is that in redshift space the role of the density contrast , @xmath44 , is played by an apparent density contrast @xmath111 ( the right hand side term of equation ( [ eq : eq20 ] ) is simply @xmath112 ) .",
    "the proposed replacement only takes into account the redshift distortion due to the smooth spherical velocity field associated with the underdensity within the sphere under consideration .",
    "the fluctuation of the velocity field around its mean is the source of an additional effect on the values of @xmath36 .",
    "we found using numerical simulations that the rms radial displacement of halos surrounding voids is @xmath113 ( patiri et al .",
    "2006 ) . as a consequence of this random displacement",
    "some halos are driven away from the void , as defined in real space , while others are drawn closer to the void .",
    "so , since the density profile around a void is increasing , there are more halos being pulled in than out and the net effect is a contraction of the voids , or alternatively , a value of @xmath114 smaller than @xmath36 .",
    "this effect is much smaller than the previous one , specially for the rather rare voids we are interested in .",
    "we suggest that this effect may be accounted for by a replacement in equation ( [ eq : eq10 ] ) of the form :    @xmath115   \\label{eq : eq21}\\ ] ]    where @xmath116 is a constant .",
    "we find , using numerical simulations , @xmath117 .",
    "using these replacements ( equations [ [ eq : eq20 ] ] and [ [ eq : eq21 ] ] ) in equation ( [ eq : eq10 ] ) we find results for @xmath109 and the number density of voids that are in excellent agreement with the numerical simulations analyzed in this work ( see appendix a for details ) . although these replacements represents the correct procedure , we shall also use , for computational reasons , an alternative procedure , in which we simply replace @xmath13 by certain function of @xmath44 ( equation a9 in appendix a ) , finding very similar results to those found using the procedure described above .",
    "in this section we focus our attention on how the vpf and the number density of voids larger than a given radius depend on redshift and cosmological parameters @xmath4 and @xmath12 . here",
    "we present the basics of the idea , referring the reader to appendix a for details on the explicit procedure . in equation ( [ eq : eq10 ] )",
    "we can see that the vpf depends on the cosmological parameters through the linear _",
    "rms _ , of density fluctuations [ @xmath118 which enters through the probability distribution for @xmath45 on the scale @xmath13 .",
    "there is also a dependence entering through @xmath64 given in equation ( [ eq : eq8 ] ) .    the @xmath8cdm   transfer function ( e.g. bardeen et al .",
    "1986 ) is essentially determined by a single parameter , @xmath12 , which determine the co - moving horizon scale at matter domination .",
    "the barion density play a small role and is negligible to most of the cases in which our framework applies .",
    "the relevant parameters determining the power spectrum are @xmath4 ( its amplitude ) and @xmath12 ( its shape ) . in appendix",
    "a we give @xmath119 as an explicit function of this two parameters , i.e. @xmath120 .",
    "it is important to note that the coefficients @xmath47 and @xmath48 in equation ( [ eq : eq8 ] ) also depends on @xmath4 and @xmath12 ( see equation [ eq : eqa5 ] ) .",
