    "( mcsp ) problem , which can be described as follows .",
    "we are given two related input strings that have to be partitioned each into the same collection of substrings .",
    "the size of the collection is subject to minimization .",

    "the mcsp problem has applications , for example , in the bioinformatics field .",
    "chen et al .",
    "@xcite point out that the mcsp problem is closely related to the problem of sorting by reversals with duplicates , a key problem in genome rearrangement .    in this paper",
    "we introduce the first integer linear program ( ilp ) for solving the mcsp problem .",
    "an experimental evaluation on problem instances from the related literature shows that this ilp can be efficiently solved , for example , by using any version of ibm ilog cplex .",
    "however , a study on new instances of larger size demonstrates the limitations of the model .",
    "therefore , we additionally introduce a deterministic 2-phase heuristic which is strongly based on the original ilp .",
    "the experimental evaluation shows that the heuristic is applicable to larger problem instances than the original ilp .",
    "moreover , it is shown that the heuristic outperforms competitor algorithms from the related literature on known problem instances .",
    "the mcsp problem can technically be described as follows .",
    "given are two input strings @xmath1 and @xmath2 , both of length @xmath3 over a finite alphabet @xmath4 .",
    "these two strings are required to be _ related _ , which means that each letter appears the same number of times in each of them .",

    "the mcsp problem has been introduced by chen et al .",
    "@xcite due to its relation to genome rearrangement .",

    "later kaplan and shafir  @xcite raised the lower bound to  @xmath23 .",
    "kolman proposed a modified version of the simple greedy algorithm with an approximation ratio of @xmath24 for the @xmath14-mcsp  @xcite .",

    "the experimental results that we outline in the following were obtained on a cluster of pcs with `` intel(r ) xeon(r ) cpu 5130 '' cpus of 4 nuclei of 2000 mhz and 4 gigabyte of ram .      for testing model @xmath57",
    "we chose the same set of benchmark instances that was used by ferdous and sohel in  @xcite for the experimental evaluation of their ant colony optimization approach .",
    "this set contains , in total , 30 artificial instances and 15 real - life instances consisting of dna sequences .",
    "remember , in this context , that each problem instance consists of two related input strings .",
    "moreover , the benchmark set consists of four subsets of instances .",
    "the first subset ( henceforth labelled group1 ) consists of 10 artificial instances in which the input strings are maximally of length 200 .",

    "tresea was run on the same machines as the ones used for the current work .",
    "finally , the last four table columns are dedicated to the presentation of the results provided by solving model @xmath57 .",
    "the first one of these columns provides the value of the best solution found within 3600 cpu seconds . in case",
    "the optimality of the corresponding solution was proved by cplex , the value is marked by an asterix . the second column dedicated to @xmath57 provides the computation time ( in seconds ) . in case of having solved the corresponding problem to optimality , this column only displays one value indicating the time needed by cplex to solve the problem .",
    "otherwise , this column provides two values in the form x / y , where x corresponds to the time at which cplex was able to find the first valid solution , and y corresponds to the time at which cplex found the best solution within 3600 cpu seconds .",
    "the third one of the columns dedicated to @xmath57 shows the optimality gap , which refers to the gap between the value of the best valid solution and the current lower bound at the time of stopping a run .",
    "finally , the last column indicates the size of set @xmath36 , that is , the size of the complete set of common blocks .",
    "note that this value corresponds to the number of variables used by @xmath57 .",
    "the best result ( among all algorithms ) for each problem instance is marked by a grey background , and the last row of each table provides averages over the whole table .",
    "+    the following conclusions can be drawn when analyzing the results .",
    "first , cplex is able to solve all instances of group1 to optimality .",
    "this is done , on average , in about 13 seconds .",
    "moreover , none of the existing algorithms was able to find any of these optimal solutions .",
    "second , cplex was also able to find new best - known solutions for all remaining 35 problem instances , even though it was not able to prove optimality within 3600 cpu seconds , which is indicated by the positive optimality gaps .",
    "an exception is instance 1 of set real which also could be solved to optimality .",
    "third , the improvements over the competitor algorithms obtained by solving @xmath57 with cplex are remarkable . in particular , the average improvement ( in percent ) over tresea ,",
    "the best competitor from the literature , is @xmath60 in the case of group1 , @xmath61 in the case of group2 , @xmath62 in the case of group3 , and @xmath63 in the case of real . + in order to study the limits of solving @xmath57 with cplex we randomly generated larger dna instances . in particular",
    ", we generated one random instance for each input string size from @xmath64 .",
    "cplex was stopped when at least 3600 cpu seconds had passed and at least one feasible solution had been found .",
    "however , if after 12 cpu hours still no feasible solution was found , the execution was stopped as well .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ tab : results : mip : large ] .",
    "the first column of this table provides the length of the corresponding random instance .",
    "the remaining four columns contain the same information as already explained in the context of tables  [ tab : results : group1]-[tab : results : real ] , just that column * time ( s ) * simply provides the computation time ( in seconds ) at which the best solution was found .",
    "analyzing the results we can observe that the application of cplex to @xmath57 quickly becomes unpractical with growing input string size .",
    "for example , the first valid solution for the instance with string length 1400 was found after 20616 seconds . concerning the largest problem instance ,",
    "no valid solution was found within 12 cpu hours .",
    "as shown at the end of the previous section , the application of cplex to @xmath57 reaches its limits starting from an input string size of about 1200 .",
    "however , if it were possible to considerably reduce the size of the set of common blocks ( @xmath36 ) , mathematical programming might still be an option to obtain good ( heuristic ) solutions .",
    "with this idea in mind we studied the distribution of the lengths of the strings of the common blocks in @xmath36 for all 45 problem instances .",
    "this distribution is shown  averaged over the instances of each of the four instance sets  in figure  [ fig : idea : heuristic ] . analyzing these distributions",
    "it can be observed , first of all , that the distribution does not seem to depend on instance size .",
    "however , the important aspect to observe is that around @xmath65 of all the common blocks contain strings of length @xmath66 .",
    "moreover , only a very small portion of these common blocks will form part of an optimal solution . in comparison , it is reasonable to assume that a much larger percentage of the blocks corresponding to large strings will form part of an optimal solution .",
    "these observations gave rise to the heuristic which is outlined in the following .",
    "the proposed heuristic works in two phases . in the first phase , a subset of @xmath36 ( the complete set of common blocks ) must be chosen .",
    "for this purpose , let @xmath67 ( where @xmath68 ) denote the subset of @xmath36 that contains all common blocks @xmath30 from @xmath36 with @xmath69 , that is , all blocks whose corresponding string is longer or equal than @xmath70 . note , in this context , that @xmath71 .",
    "moreover , note that @xmath72 .",
    "let @xmath73 be the smallest value for @xmath70 such that @xmath74 .",
    "observe that @xmath75 only contains the common blocks with the longest strings .",
    "having chosen a specific value for @xmath70 from @xmath76 $ ] , the following ilp , henceforth referred to as @xmath77 , may be solved .",
    "b_i b_l ( c |t_i| - 1 ) x_i + & + _ b_i b_l |t_i| x_i & n [ eqn : const4 ] + _ b_i b_l m1_i , j x_i & 1 j=1,  ,n [ eqn : const5 ] + _",

    "moreover , matrices @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the same as the ones introduced in section  [ sec : puremip ] , that is , they are defined over the whole set @xmath36 .",
    "the objective function basically maximizes the sum of the lengths of the strings corresponding to the chosen common blocks .",
    "however , the length of the string corresponding to each block is multiplied by a large - enough constant @xmath79 , and the result is decremented by one .",
    "this has the following effect . in case of several solutions for which the sum of the lengths of the strings corresponding to the selected common blocks is equal",
    ", the program prefers the solution that reaches this sum with fewer common blocks .",
    "the constraints ( [ eqn : const4]-[eqn : const6 ] ) are the same as in @xmath57 ( see section  [ sec : puremip ] ) , apart from the fact that all equality symbols are replaced by the @xmath80-symbol . in short ,",
    "the idea of @xmath77 is to produce a partial solution for the original mcsp that covers as much as possible of both input strings , while choosing as few common blocks as possible .    solving @xmath77",
    "will henceforth be referred to as _ phase 1 _ of the proposed heuristic .",
    "let us denote by @xmath81 the solution provided by phase 1 .. ] due to the constraints of @xmath77 this solution is a valid partial solution to the original mcsp problem .",
    "the idea of the second phase is then to produce the best complete solution possible that contains @xmath81 .",

    "this completes the description of the heuristic .      just like model @xmath57",
    ", the heuristic was implemented in ansi c++ using gcc 4.7.3 for compiling the software .",
    "the two ilp models were solved with ibm ilog cplex v12.1 , and the same machines as for the experimental evaluation of @xmath57 were used for running the experiments .    as mentioned before",
    ", the heuristic may be applied for any value of @xmath70 from the interval @xmath76 $ ] .",
    "in fact , we applied the heuristic to each of the 45 problem instances from sets group1 , group2 , group3 , and real , with all possible values for @xmath70 . in order not to spend too much computation time the following stopping criterion",
    "was used for each call to cplex concerning any of the two involved ilp models .",
    "cplex was stopped ( 1 ) in case a provenly optimal solution was obtained or ( 2 ) in case at least 50 cpu seconds were spent and the first valid solution was obtained .",
    "the overall result of the heuristic for a specific problem instance is the value of the best solution found for any value of @xmath70 .",
    "moreover , as computation time we provide the sum of the computation times spend for all applications for different value of @xmath70 .",

    "the heuristic is only able to match the results of applying cplex to model @xmath57 in three out of 45 cases .",
    "however , this changes with growing instance size , as we will show later in section  [ sec : large ] .      with the aim of gaining more insight into the behavior of the heuristic with respect to the choice of a value for parameter @xmath70 , the following information is presented in graphical form in figure  [ fig : results : heuristic ] .",

    "finally , the last column gives information about the number of common blocks considered by the heuristic in comparison to the size of the complete set of common blocks ( which can be found in table  [ tab : results : mip : large ] ) .",
    "in particular , summing the common block set sizes from phases 1 and 2 of the heuristic and comparing this number with the size of the complete set of common blocks , the percentage of the common blocks considered by the heuristic can easily be calculated .",
    "this percentage is given in the last table column .",
    "as in all tables of this paper , the best result per table row is marked by a grey background .",
    "the following observations can be made .",
    "first , apart from the smallest problem instance , the heuristic outperforms the application of cplex to model @xmath57 .",
    "moreover , this is achieved in a fraction of the time needed by cplex .",
    "finally , it is reasonable to assume that the success of the heuristic is due to an important reduction of the common blocks that are considered ( see last table column ) . in general",
    ", the heuristic only considers between @xmath90 and @xmath91 of all common blocks . this is why the computation times are rather low in comparison to cplex .",
    "in this paper we considered a problem with applications in bioinformatics known as the minimum common string partition problem .",
    "first , we introduced an integer linear programming model for this problem . by applying the ibm ilog cplex solver to this model we were able to improve all best - known solutions from the literature for a problem instance set consisting of 45 instances of different sizes .",
    "the smallest ones of these problem instances could even be solved to optimality in very short computation time .",
    "the second contribution of the paper concerned a 2-phase heuristic which is strongly based on the developed integer linear programming model .",
    "the results have shown that , first , the heuristic outperforms competitor algorithms from the literature , and second , that it is applicable to larger problem instances .",
    "concerning future work , we aim at studying the incorporation of mathematical programming strategies based on the introduced integer linear programming model into metaheuristic techniques such as grasp and iterated greedy algorithms .",
    "moreover , we aim at identifying other string - based optimization problems for which a 2-phase strategy such as the one introduced in this paper might work well .      c.  blum was supported by project tin2012 - 37930 of the spanish government .",
