    "the thermal desorption ( sublimation ) rate for a volatile is set by its energy barrier for ice desorption in concert with the grain temperature .",
    "common volatiles like h@xmath4o , co@xmath4 , and co are characterized by very different desorption barriers . for a typical disk with midplane temperatures that increase closer to the host star",
    ", this range of desorption energy barriers will introduce a series of distinct locations   snow lines \"  where specific volatiles are liberated from ices into the gas phase .",

    "irradiation heating maintains a thermal inversion in the disk atmosphere , where temperatures increase with height ( @xmath5 ) above the midplane ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "in addition to thermal desorption , there are analogous non - thermal processes driven by interactions between ice and high - energy photons and particles , or the release of chemical energy @xcite .",

    "* ) and the high uv desorption yields measured in laboratory experiments @xcite . in the inner disk , uv photodesorption can result in lower scale heights for snow surfaces compared to the ones expected from thermal desorption @xcite . at the low densities of the outer disk ,",
    "uv radiation may penetrate to the cold midplane to desorb co ice well outside the expected location of the thermal co snowline @xcite .",
    "dco@xmath2 is expected to form efficiently in cold regions where co gas is still present in the gas - phase , whether thermally or non - thermally desorbed , through deuteron transfer from the low - temperature ( t@xmath750  k ) product h@xmath4d@xmath2 to co. therefore , the expectation is that dco@xmath2 emission peaks close to the co snow surface , i.e. at the coldest disk locations where co is still abundant in the gas - phase if only thermal desorption is considered .",

    "exterior to 90  au , the co , hco@xmath2 and dco@xmath2 gas - phase midplane abundances begin to increase . with decreasing density , the freeze - out rate decreases , which changes the co desorption / freeze - out balance and therefore increases the gas / solid ratio .",
    "the accompanying decrease in column density results in increased uv penetration and therefore co ice uv photodesorption , further increasing the co gas / solid ratio .",
    "the result is a substantial amount of co gas in the cold , outer disk midplane , corresponding to a c@xmath0o abundance of @xmath34 with respect to n@xmath35 .",

    "by contrast , a c@xmath0o abundance of @xmath36 is reached in the warm molecular disk layer , @xmath37 , and this is the main reservoir of c@xmath0o gas in the outer disk .",
    "hco@xmath2 and dco@xmath2 are also present in the warm molecular disk layer , but this layer is no longer the dominant reservoir . in the case of dco@xmath2 ,",
    "the midplane and molecular layer abundances are comparable .",
    "the relatively high dco@xmath2 abundance in the midplane , at @xmath38 , is due to the increased efficiency of dco@xmath2 production at low temperatures . because of an increasing gas density toward the disk midplane ,",
    "the vertically integrated dco@xmath2 column density is dominated by the midplane dco@xmath2 in the outer disk .",

    "it shows a radial gradient small change at @xmath325au at the onset of co freeze - out .",
    "the effect of co gas in the midplane beyond 90  au on the co emission profile is subtle , and in practice unobservable , since the overall column density and thus emission at these radii is dominated by the abundant gas - phase co in the warmer atmosphere layers .",
    "the hco@xmath2 and dco@xmath2 emission profiles decrease rapidly at radii of 2540au , due to the freeze - out of gas - phase co ( their formation reservoir ) .",
    "the hco@xmath2 emission then presents a `` plateau '' out to 100  au , attributed to cosmic ray and uv photodesorption of co back into the gas phase .",
    "the effect of the midplane co non - thermal desorption on the dco@xmath2 emission is , as expected , more dramatic .",
    "the return of co to the gas at large radii , where low temperatures drives ann efficient deuterium fractionation chemistry , results in a second maximum ( outer ring ) peaking at 200  au .",
    "dco@xmath2 also presents a small peak toward the central star , caused by warm deuterium fractionation chemistry , and an inner ring close to the co midplane snow line . unlike for co emission",
    ", the presence of cold co in the outer midplane has a considerable effect on hco@xmath2 and dco@xmath2 emission , which should be observable .",
    "based on a small grid of models the shapes of the predicted co , hco@xmath2 and dco@xmath2 radial profiles are not sensitive to specific model assumptions . in particular",
    "the two concentric dco@xmath2 rings are reproduced when changing the co binding energy from 1150 to 1000  k , i.e. from a water to a co dominated ice environment , and when the cr ionization rate is reduced to 10@xmath39 s@xmath17 . in the latter case",
    "uv photodesorption still maintains cold co gas in the outer disk , albeit at a lower level compared to when a high cosmic ray ionization rate is assumed .",
    "that is , the outer ring is still present when the cosmic ray ionization is attenuated , but it may be less pronounced .",
    "the molecular emission trends in fig [ fig2 ] thus appears to be robust as long as some non - thermal desorption process is active in the disk midplane . however , the absolute dco@xmath2 column density and predicted emission profile in the outer disk do depend on model parameters , and whether the predicted dco@xmath2 double - ring will be observable may thus vary from disk to disk .",
    "qualitatively , the observed and predicted co , hco@xmath2 and dco@xmath2 radial profiles agree well . in particular",
    ", the model reproduces several key features of the i m  lup observations : the centrally peaked c@xmath0o emission profile , the h@xmath1co@xmath2 shoulder in the outer disk , and the dco@xmath2 inner ring and outer ring .",
    "however , the model shows no signs of a central depression for c@xmath0o , and only a very small depression for h@xmath1co@xmath2 .",
    "for dco@xmath2 , the model double - ring is accompanied by an emission peak at the disk center , which is also not observed .",
    "the most surprising result from the alma observations is the clear detection of a concentric pair of emission rings in the dco@xmath2 32 spectral line , peaking at radii of @xmath390 and 300au .",
    "based on the midplane temperature profile for the i m lup disk that was inferred from previous measurements @xcite , the inner ring may coincide with the onset of co freeze - out .",
    "the relationship between the co midplane snowline and the inner dco@xmath2 ring location is , however , complicated by multiple dco@xmath2 formation pathways in the inner disk .",
    "the outer dco@xmath2 ring requires the return of some co into the gas - phase at large disk radii .",
    "this can be accomplished by either non - thermal ice desorption or a radial thermal inversion in the low density outer region .",
    "of the two scenarios we favor the former , since it naturally explains the large dco@xmath2 enhancement and the much smaller h@xmath1co@xmath2 enhancement at large disk radii .",
    "this could be observationally checked by observing additional dco@xmath2 and h@xmath1co@xmath2 lines that constrain the gas temperature .",
    "the location of the outer dco@xmath2 ring coincides with the disappearance of mm - grain emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "it may also coincide with a steepening of the gas - density profile @xcite .",
    "the radial profile of smaller grains , which carry most of the opacity at uv wavelengths , is not known independently , but it seems reasonable to assume that it too is steepening at the same radius .",
    "the dco@xmath2 outer ring then likely coincides with a disk location where the uv radiation penetration depth is increasing rapidly with radius .",
    "the connection between the dco@xmath2 outer ring and uv radiation is supported by chemical modeling .",
    "an outer dco@xmath2 ring is produced when co is non - thermally desorbed from icy grains in the cold , low - density outer disk . in the model uv photodesorption and cr heating",
    "are both important , but the coincidence between the ring and the loss of dust opacity suggests that in the case of i m lup , uv photodesorption is the most important desorption mechanism in the outer disk . once in the gas phase , co can be chemically converted into dco@xmath2 following deuteron transfers from abundant reservoirs of h@xmath4d@xmath2 and other deuterated h@xmath29 isotopologues ( which are enhanced at such low temperatures ) .",
    "this effect is expected to be generally present in disks and especially pronounced in disks with significant grain growth , which reduces uv opacity . in our model",
    "we assume a uniform grain growth throughout the disk , parameterized as a reduction in total grain surface area by a factor of 10 .",
    "further grain growth is likely present in older disks , and it may therefore be illustrative to compare the dco@xmath2 distribution in disks of different ages and with different grain properties as estimated from continuum observations @xcite .",
    "based on the discussion above and the seemingly robust model results in  [ model_results ] , it is tempting to conclude that concentric dco@xmath2 rings should be commonly observed in protoplanetary disks .",
    "it is important to realize however , that the expected intensity of the second dco@xmath2 ring _ is _ model dependent .",
    "@xcite , for example , finds a dco@xmath2 enhancement in the outer disk , but it is small compared to the findings in our model .",
    "the same is true in the model by @xcite . in general",
    ", the dco@xmath2 abundance in the outer disk will depend on the intensity and penetration depths of radiation fields ( uv , cosmic rays and x - rays ) , and the dco@xmath2 ring column density will depend on the total amount of cold molecular gas exposed to this radiation . the intensity of the dco@xmath2 ring will also depend on the excitation conditions that characterize the outer disk midplane , especially its density and temperature .",
    "it may very well be that dco@xmath2 rings , while common , are only observable in a small sub - set of disks where disk density , temperature and radiation structures conspire to produce sufficient amounts of dco@xmath2 flux at large disk radii .",
    "still the detection of one such outer ring in the i m  lup disk demonstrates that non - thermal desorption in general , and uv photodesorption of co in particular , is important in setting the chemical structure of protoplanetary disks .",
    "a lingering puzzle in the observations presented here is the central depression in the intensities of all the observed spectral lines ( but notably not in the continuum ) .",
    "we consider four potential explanations for these depressions : ( 1 ) a reduction in the gas surface densities ; ( 2 ) line - of - sight absorption by foreground cloud material ; ( 3 ) unexpected chemistry ; and ( 4 ) high continuum optical depths that prevent some of the line emission from escaping the disk .",
    "the first possibility seems unlikely , since there is no analogous signature in the continuum , and we are unaware of a physical mechanism that would systematically enhance the mm dust - to - gas ratio in the inner disk .",
    "the second scenario , molecular cloud contamination , should produce deeper depressions ( absorption ) for the more optically thick spectral lines .",
    "inspection of co data toward the same source show that co exhibits less visible depressions than c@xmath0o , ruling out this scenario .",
    "chemistry can produce central depressions in hco@xmath2 and dco@xmath2 following desorption of h@xmath4o and other molecules with high proton affinity in the inner disk , resulting in efficient proton transfer from hco@xmath2 and dco@xmath2 to h@xmath4o .",
    "chemistry may thus contribute to the h@xmath1co@xmath2 and dco@xmath2 holes .",
    "the c@xmath0o central depression is not predicted by our or any other published disk chemistry model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though the conversion efficiency of co into other species across the disk is an active topic of research ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". based on the results presented so far , it seems unlikely , however , that chemistry alone can explain the entire observed effect .",
    "the last proposed explanation is that the continuum optical depths in the disk center are high enough to block some of the line emission from the midplane .",
    "the deeper depressions observed for more optically thin tracers , which originate closer to the midplane , and for lines emitted at higher frequencies ( especially h@xmath1co@xmath2 ) supports this scenario . but",
    "this scenario has one significant problem : the peak continuum intensity at the disk center corresponds to a brightness temperature of only 6  k , much lower than expected for optically thick emission at these radii . the only way of reconciling this explanation with the data is through significant beam dilution .",
    "if the optically thick continuum emission is concentrated in small scale features ( occupying an area @xmath35@xmath40 smaller than the synthesized beam ) , then this scenario may work .",
    "that may seem unlikely , but the recent observations of the hl tau disk showing small scale structure @xcite indicate that it remains a possibility .",
    "this hypothesis could be tested directly by very high spatial resolution continuum measurements , or less directly by observations of co and hco@xmath2 isotopologue lines at 3  mm , where the dust opacity should be reduced .",
    "alma observations of the massive disk around i m lup have revealed a spectacular dco@xmath2 double - ringed structure .",
    "the inner ring appears connected with the thermal co snowline , but dust opacity and multiple dco@xmath2 formation pathways complicate the interpretation . the second",
    ", outer dco@xmath2 emission ring at 300  au is readily reproduced by non - thermal co ice desorption in the low - density , outer disk .",
    "the ring coincides with a rapid decrease in dust opacity , which is likely accompanied by increased uv penetration toward the disk midplane .",
    "we hypothesize that the dco@xmath2 outer ring is caused by efficient uv photodesorption of co ice at this radius .    without the presence of non - thermal desorption",
    "this outer disk region would be completely devoid of co gas and thus of co - gas - mediated chemistry . even at its most efficient , non - thermal desorption in disk mid planes",
    "is not expected to maintain a large fraction of co in the gas - phase , @xmath41% of the total co reservoir .",
    "the presented observations and models show , however , that the release of such trace amounts of co into the gas - phase can still produce an observable signature through its effects on dco@xmath2 production .",
    "this dco@xmath2 can be used as a probe of the kinematics and ionization in the outer disk midplane , opening up a new window on the structures of protoplanetary disks .",

    "<S> the images of these dust and gas tracers are clearly resolved . the dco@xmath2 line exhibits a striking pair of concentric rings of emission that peak at radii of @xmath306 and 2  ( @xmath390 and 300au , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> based on disk chemistry model comparison , the inner dco@xmath2 ring is associated with the balance of co freeze - out and thermal desorption due to a radial decrease in disk temperature . the outer dco@xmath2 ring is explained by non - thermal desorption of co ice in the low - column - density outer disk , repopulating the disk midplane with cold co gas . </S>",
    "<S> the co gas then reacts with abundant h@xmath4d@xmath2 to form the observed dco@xmath2 outer ring . </S>",
    "<S> these observations demonstrate that spatially resolved dco@xmath2 emission can be used to trace otherwise hidden cold gas reservoirs in the outmost disk regions , opening a new window onto their chemistry and kinematics . </S>"
