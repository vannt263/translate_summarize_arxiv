    "ever since the demise of the standard cold dark matter model , which proved unable to simultaneously match the cobe observations of cosmic microwave background anisotropies , the abundance of rich galaxy clusters and the shape of the galaxy correlation function , it has been fashionable to study variations on this basic theme . a popular alternative is to lower the matter density , thus shifting the epoch of matter  radiation equality in a desirable direction . to keep the possibility that standard models of inflation ,",
    "generating a spatially - flat universe , might be responsible for the seed perturbations , the most popular version of this model is to introduce a cosmological constant @xmath0 to maintain the spatial flatness .",
    "this has proven a compelling framework within which it is possible to understand the formation and evolution of large - scale structure in the universe @xcite .",
    "the favoured models , until recently , had the energy density @xmath1 in the cosmological constant lying in the range 0.5 to 0.7 . as well as giving a good fit to large - scale structure observations , these models have support from two further sources .",
    "if one assumes the baryon density in the universe is that predicted by standard big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite , and that large galaxy clusters provide a representative sample of the universal ratio between baryons and the total amount of matter in the universe  @xcite , then the matter density must be significantly below one .",
    "further , the need to have the age of the universe , @xmath2 , exceeding the age of the globular clusters in our galaxy suggests that @xmath1 should be as large as possible . until recently the required value for @xmath2 was usually around 14 gyrs @xcite , but a revised cepheid distance scale due to new distance estimates by the satellite hipparcos has brought this down to something more like 12 gyrs @xcite . given that most measurements ( even taking into account hipparcos s revision of the cepheid distance scale ) seem to suggest that the present value of the hubble parameter , @xmath3 , is at least 0.6 ( in the usual units of @xmath4 ) @xcite and perhaps even larger @xcite , in a flat universe we would then need @xmath5 ( 0.55 if @xmath6 ) .",
    "unfortunately , these models have been dealt a serious blow by the preliminary results from the supernova cosmology project @xcite , which attempts to determine the magnitude  redshift diagram of type ia supernovae .",
    "they place a 95 per cent confidence upper limit of @xmath7 for flat universes .",
    "this is significantly stronger than earlier limits from the galaxy velocity distribution @xcite , galaxy outflows from voids @xcite and the statistical analysis of the frequency of gravitational lensing of high - redshift quasars @xcite , all coming in around @xmath8 .",
    "while the @xmath0cdm model remains viable with these smaller @xmath1 values , this is seen as much less attractive because , as in the critical - density case , the required matter density is well above that given by direct observation .",
    "a way out of this dilemma is to move to cosmological models where the cosmological constant is substituted by a dynamical quantity which decays with time @xcite . within these models",
    "it is possible to relax the constraints resulting both from the frequency of gravitational lensing of high - redshift quasars and from type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "while in some ways this is clearly a regressive step , introducing more freedom into the model , it can also be argued that such a situation may be more natural on particle physics grounds .",
    "for example , there is the well - known difficulty within quantum field theory to understand the very small vacuum energy density , @xmath9 , required by a cosmological constant .",
    "if not strictly zero , due to some yet unknown cancellation mechanism , one would expect @xmath10 to be between 50 and 120 orders of magnitude larger @xcite ! a decaying cosmological constant term would be a simple way of reconciling a very large vacuum energy density early on in the universe with an extremely small one at present .    some authors have simply assumed more or less _ ad hoc _ decay laws for the cosmological constant term @xcite . by comparing predictions of the models with observations it was then hoped that the correct decay law could be recovered , which would then shed some light on the possible physical process behind the decaying cosmological constant term .",
    "however , a credible mechanism for obtaining such a term already exists , which is to assume the existence of a scalar field presently relaxing towards the minimum of its potential ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "scalar fields are not only predicted to exist by some particle physics theories that go beyond the standard model , but are also the most plausible engine behind a possible inflationary period in the very early universe @xcite .",
    "the overall dynamics of the universe in the presence of a relaxing scalar field , and its consequences for several classical cosmological tests , has been studied in detail by various authors @xcite .",
    "our aim in this paper is to study the effect of spatial perturbations in the cosmological ` constant ' term given by such a field , in particular on the growth of the matter perturbations . when one has the standard constant @xmath0 term , there is no possibility of any perturbations in it .",
    "however , as soon as one permits any form of time variation , general covariance immediately implies that it must be able to support spatial perturbations . despite this , presumably because of the development of this line of research from the original constant case , with few exceptions @xcite most authors have not looked at the possible effect of spatial perturbations in the background value of the scalar field on the growth of perturbations in the matter distribution .",
    "we will assume that the background space - time contains an ideal fluid and a scalar field .",
    "the equation of state of the ideal fluid , relating its background pressure , @xmath11 , to its background energy density , @xmath12 , is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a constant .",
    "the background energy density and pressure associated with a minimally coupled real scalar field with potential @xmath15 are given by @xmath16 the overdots represent derivatives with respect to coordinate time @xmath17 .",
    "the evolution of these background quantities is described by the friedmann equation , @xmath18\\,,\\ ] ] together with the two energy conservation equations @xmath19 for the ideal fluid and the scalar field respectively .",
    "here @xmath20 is the hubble parameter , @xmath21 the cosmic scale factor , and @xmath22 represents a derivative with respect to @xmath23 .",
    "we shall carry out a fully relativistic treatment of the perturbations , using a formalism based on a series of papers by hwang @xcite .",
    "as always , the equations describing the evolution of the perturbations are very complicated and we have relegated their discussion to our two appendices . a crucial question when studying perturbations is the choice of gauge",
    ". we shall consider two choices .",
    "mainly we shall use the zero - shear gauge ( zsg ) [ also known as conformal newtonian or longitudinal ] , but we shall also solve the equations in the uniform - curvature gauge ( ucg ) as a check on the accuracy of the numerical calculations .",
    "the perturbation equations , described in the appendices , relate the perturbed part of the metric variables , @xmath24 ( perturbed part of the lapse function ) , @xmath25 ( perturbed part of the spatial curvature ) , @xmath26 ( perturbed part of the shear ) and @xmath27 ( perturbed part of the expansion scalar ) , to the perturbed part of the matter variables , @xmath28 ( perturbed part of the total energy density ) , @xmath29 ( perturbed part of the total pressure ) and @xmath30 ( perturbed part of the total energy density flux , or total fluid four - velocity , depending on the frame chosen ) . in the zsg @xmath26",
    "is chosen to vanish , while in the ucg @xmath25 vanishes . in all , we will need to numerically integrate a system of seven simultaneous first - order ordinary differential equations , formed by the background equations , eqs .",
    "( [ back1 ] ) to ( [ back3 ] ) , where eq .",
    "( [ energyevol ] ) gives @xmath12 , and the four perturbation equations resulting from either eqs .",
    "( [ pertzsg7 ] ) and ( [ pertzsg8 ] ) ( in the zsg ) , or eqs .",
    "( [ pertucg7 ] ) and ( [ pertucg8 ] ) ( in the ucg ) .",
    "we must now specify the initial conditions required in order to solve this system .",
    "we shall do that by providing the initial values for the quantities @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the first two give the initial values for @xmath25 and @xmath35 ( zsg ) ( @xmath26 and @xmath36 in the ucg ) by means of eqs .",
    "( [ pertzsg3 ] ) and ( [ pertzsg4 ] ) [ eqs .",
    "( [ pertucg3 ] ) and ( [ pertucg4 ] ) in the ucg ] .",
    "we make two requirements on the initial conditions .",
    "the first is to choose the initial value of @xmath32 so that only the growing mode of the solution for the evolution of an ideal fluid in an einstein - de sitter universe is present ( see the exact analytical solutions in table 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , as this is the situation we would expect in the later phase of the evolution of the universe if the density perturbations in the ideal fluid were produced in the very early universe .",
    "secondly , we will assume that the energy density perturbations in the ideal fluid and the scalar field are related by the adiabatic condition @xcite .",
    "standard models of inflation @xcite always give this type of perturbation , as there is only one dynamical degree of freedom during inflation , and so it is by far the most natural choice to make .",
    "the entropy perturbation should therefore vanish , @xmath37 together with its first time derivative , @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 the quantities @xmath41 represent the internal entropy of each component . in the case of the ideal fluid",
    "we have @xmath42 . from the adiabatic conditions we obtain the initial values of @xmath43 and @xmath34 , @xmath44}\\,,\\\\ \\label{adiabcond2 }",
    "\\delta\\phi'&=&\\phi'\\frac{\\epsilon_{\\gamma}}{\\gamma\\mu_{\\gamma}}-      \\frac{\\delta\\phi v,_{\\phi}}{a^{2}h^{2}\\phi'}+\\phi'\\alpha\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we also need to specify the initial values of the background variables @xmath45 , @xmath23 and @xmath46 which determine the cosmological model .",
    "the initial value of @xmath12 is obtained by the requirement that the universe has critical density .",
    "the other three degrees of freedom for the initial background conditions are fixed by requiring specific present values of the cosmological quantities @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath47 .",
    "note that for some @xmath15 , and given the required values for @xmath3 and @xmath47 , it may not be possible to obtain the desired value for @xmath2 .",
    "in general , for fixed @xmath3 and @xmath47 there will be a maximum value @xmath2 that can be reached for a given @xmath15 .",
    "before we go on to perform the numerical integration of the perturbation equations in both the zsg and the ucg , we need to specify what type of ideal fluid we will consider and the shape of the scalar field potential .",
    "we are mainly interested in the growth of matter density perturbations during the matter dominated era , and there are good reasons to believe that most matter in the universe has negligible intrinsic velocity , i.e.  it is _ cold_. in this paper we will assume that the ideal fluid has no pressure , that is @xmath48 .    with relation to the type of scalar field we should consider the issue is not as clear .",
    "many different scalar fields have been proposed , most of them with the specific aim of producing an inflationary expansion phase in the very early universe , though some also originate from attempts at extending the standard model of particle physics .",
    "we will consider two different scalar field potentials , an exponential potential of the form @xmath49 and the potential associated with a pseudo - nambu - goldstone - boson ( pngb ) field @xcite , @xmath50\\,.\\ ] ] both these potentials have been extensively studied , within the context of power - law inflation @xcite and natural inflation @xcite respectively .",
    "the pngb field has also been proposed explicitly as the most natural candidate for a presently - existing minimally - coupled scalar field @xcite .    in both cases we have two degrees of freedom , and in principle",
    "one should explore the full 2-dimensional parameter space defined by them . however , our main objective in this paper is to draw attention to the importance of taking into account the possibility of spatial perturbations in a cosmological scalar field when one is assumed to exist , due to their influence on the growth of matter density perturbations .",
    "therefore , in this paper we will only consider two sets of values for the constants associated with each of the two potentials",
    ".    in two of the models thus obtained , one for each potential , the scalar field presently behaves like a slowly - decaying cosmological constant . in these models",
    ", we will choose the initial values of the background variables @xmath45 , @xmath23 and @xmath46 , and the constants associated with the potentials , so that we end up with @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and an age for the universe of @xmath53 . in the other two models , again one for each potential ,",
    "the scalar field starts behaving like non - relativistic matter , scaling as @xmath54 , at a redshift close to 100 .",
    "therefore , the age of the universe in these models is pretty much the same as if the universe was always matter dominated . in order to obtain an acceptable age we lower @xmath3 slightly to @xmath55 to give @xmath56 .",
    "our numerical integration of the perturbation equations will begin at a redshift of @xmath57 , roughly at electron  photon decoupling , and end at the present time .",
    "one reason for this choice is that through the cobe satellite measurement of the amplitude of cosmic microwave background anisotropies we have good knowledge of the amplitude of energy density perturbations existing at the horizon scale at this redshift @xcite .",
    "the main reason though is that for reasonable parameter values we are well into matter domination and the effects of radiation on the matter power spectrum of density perturbations have already run their course . at this redshift , the power spectrum is well described by the cold dark matter transfer function , for example as parametrized by bardeen et al .",
    "we are thus able to analyze the effects of the scalar field on the matter power spectrum , without them being concealed within the full boltzmann code machinery .",
    "we can not however make predictions for the full microwave anisotropy power spectrum .      for the exponential potential",
    "there is a particularly interesting situation , which we will call exp1 , where the relative energy densities of the scalar field and the ideal fluid remain constant with time , thus implying @xmath58 , after a transitional period .",
    "the energy density associated with the scalar field is then a fixed fraction , @xmath59 , of the total energy density in the universe @xcite .",
    "this scaling solution of the cosmological background equations is one of two attractor points for the system , the other being the well - known power - law inflation solution .",
    "the former is the one which is attained if the potential is steep enough . as homogeneous perturbations around the scaling solution typically have complex eigenvalues , the system usually approaches the attractor point through oscillations in the relative energy densities of the scalar field and the ideal fluid .",
    "it has recently been studied by ferreira and joyce @xcite , though for different parameters than the model we will look at .    that the universe eventually reaches the scaling solution with @xmath60 demands that @xmath61 .",
    "we choose the scalar field energy density at the start of the simulation to be much smaller than that of the scaling solution ; this is not necessary , though it does have to be true much earlier at nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "this restricts the possible combinations for the values of @xmath62 at @xmath57 and @xmath63 .",
    "the value @xmath23 takes at @xmath57 is a matter of definition and we set it to zero .",
    "we will assume @xmath62 to be extremely small at @xmath57 , thus implying that @xmath64 . with this choice of parameters",
    "the scalar field begins to contribute significantly to the total energy density in the universe by a redshift of about 70 . in accordance with the discussion above",
    ", this model therefore gives the same age as the einstein ",
    "de sitter case , and to make it large enough we choose @xmath55 .",
    "the second situation we consider , denoted exp2 , is where the system is presently entering a period of power - law inflationary expansion , analogous to the exponential expansion which would arise if a cosmological constant is present in the universe . to obtain our desired values ( stated above ) for @xmath65 , @xmath3 and",
    "@xmath2 implies roughly that @xmath66 . on the other hand",
    ", these constraints only very weakly define the initial splitting of the energy density associated with the scalar field at @xmath57 into its potential and kinetic parts .",
    "we will again arbitrarily assume that @xmath67 , thus implying @xmath68 .      in the case of the pngb potential we will also examine two distinct possible evolution histories for the universe . in the model we will call pngb1 , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 , the scalar field starts to roll down its potential at a redshift of about 100 , and is presently coherently oscillating at the bottom of the potential , behaving dynamically as cold matter .",
    "this model , like exp1 , gives the same age as a universe containing only matter , so again we take @xmath3 to be 0.55 , giving an age for the universe of 12 gyrs .",
    "the constraint @xmath71 implies that @xmath72 and @xmath73 .    in model pngb2 , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 , the scalar field begins moving down its potential at around @xmath76 , and has not yet reached the bottom of the potential by the present time .",
    "the values of @xmath77 and @xmath78 in this model coincide with those chosen for a more detailed analysis by frieman et al .",
    "@xcite in their paper dealing with pngb motivated dynamical cosmological constant models . and @xmath79 , where the scalar field starts moving down the pngb potential at @xmath80 and is presently already oscillating around its minimum .",
    "these values were chosen so that the model yields @xmath71 and @xmath81 .",
    "this implies an age for the universe only slightly above 10 gyr .",
    "we prefer the pngb2 model over theirs .",
    "if one chose to obtain @xmath82 , and thus an age close to 12 gyr , one would end up with @xmath83 .",
    "] imposing the boundary condition @xmath71 leads to @xmath84 and @xmath73 , while @xmath85 and @xmath53 are obtained by simply choosing the correct value for @xmath45 at @xmath57 .",
    "we will work in the zsg , and display the fluid density perturbation @xmath86 .",
    "we arbitrarily take its initial value at redshift 1100 to be @xmath87 ; as the equations are linear , and our main results only show power spectra relative to one another , the initial magnitude of the density perturbation is irrelevant . note that the density perturbations given in different gauges coincide on scales well within the horizon , but otherwise , though uniquely defined as long as the gauge is given , do not coincide .",
    "care must therefore be taken in interpreting any long - wavelength behaviour .",
    "most of the literature uses the comoving gauge if the large - scale power spectrum is shown .",
    "we integrated the background and perturbation equations both in the zsg and the ucg using the nag fortran library routine d02cjf , which is based on a variable - order , variable - step adams method , for values of @xmath88 in the range of @xmath87 to @xmath89 .",
    "we did this not only for the four scalar field models chosen in the previous section , but also for two cases where no scalar field was assumed present , which will serve as comparison .",
    "in one the universe has critical density , while in the other the universe is flat with @xmath90 , thus implying the presence of a cosmological constant .",
    "= 9.5 cm +    in fig .  1 we plot the present amplitude obtained for @xmath91 ( for simplicity henceforth omitting the superscript and always meaning this gauge ) for our four models , relative to that found in the case of a flat universe with @xmath90 ( with @xmath3 in this comparison model adjusted to match that of each of the four scalar field models we consider ) .",
    "the main integration runs were done in the zsg , but when the same runs were performed in the ucg , with @xmath92 calculated from @xmath93 using eq .",
    "( [ grelucg3 ] ) and then @xmath94 from @xmath95 using eq .",
    "( [ grelzsg3 ] ) , the difference in the present value of @xmath96 was less than one per cent over the whole range for @xmath88 in the four models .",
    "although we believe that eqs .",
    "( [ adiabcond1 ] ) and ( [ adiabcond2 ] ) should be used to obtain the initial values for @xmath33 and @xmath97 , in accordance with the adiabatic relations eqs .",
    "( [ adiabcond1 ] ) and ( [ adiabcond2 ] ) one expects from inflationary generated perturbations , we also looked at what occurs when arbitrary initial values for these quantities are assumed . after performing several integration runs for a variety of initial values for @xmath33 and @xmath97",
    ", we reached the conclusion that the evolution of the energy density perturbations in the ideal fluid is almost ( to a few per cent ) independent of the initial values one considers for these quantities , as long as they are less than of order unity .",
    "in particular , this holds true ( to better than 1 per cent ) when it is assumed that there are no initial scalar field perturbations either in the zsg , i.e. @xmath98 , or in the ucg , i.e. @xmath99 . so the initial condition for the scalar field perturbations does not seem particularly important .    in fig .  2 we plot the evolution of @xmath100 for perturbations with a comoving wavenumber of @xmath101 between @xmath102 and the present .",
    "all the four scalar field models are shown , together with the cases of a critical - density universe and a flat universe with @xmath90 .",
    "the integration runs were actually started at @xmath57 , but all models behave very much as the critical - density case up to @xmath102 . we chose the wavenumber shown",
    "as it corresponds to a scale which was already well inside the hubble radius at the beginning of the integrations , so we need not worry about specifying the gauge .",
    "in fact , comparing the present amplitude of @xmath103 obtained in the zsg and in the ucg for the various models under consideration , we find that the density perturbations in the two gauges coincide for values of @xmath88 down to about @xmath104 , and can therefore be regarded as gauge - independent . for smaller @xmath88 values",
    "one needs to be careful to specify the gauge used .",
    "= 9.5 cm +    as mentioned in section iii , fig .",
    "1 represents the distortion in the square root of the matter power spectrum suffered since redshift @xmath105 , @xmath106 , relative to a flat universe with @xmath90 and no scalar field .",
    "since the full spectrum in that model , including all known effects of radiation and neutrinos , is well known , we can therefore use it to obtain the expected present shape of @xmath107 for our four scalar field models .",
    "we show the power spectra in fig .  3 , where we simply multiplied the expected present shape of @xmath107 in a flat universe with @xmath90 , @xmath108 and either @xmath82 or @xmath85 , with no scalar field present , by @xmath109 .",
    "this procedure is correct since up to @xmath57 the background and perturbation evolution of any of the scalar field models is equivalent to that of a cosmological constant model which has the same values for @xmath110 and @xmath3 as each individual scalar field model .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "3 the expected present shape of @xmath107 in a critical - density universe for the two values of @xmath3 considered .",
    "we obtained the expected present shape of @xmath107 for both the critical density and the cosmological constant cases by assuming a harrison  zeldovich ( scale - invariant ) primordial power spectrum for the energy density perturbations and using the cold dark matter transfer function initially derived by bardeen et al .",
    "@xcite , and later modified by sugiyama @xcite to include the contribution of baryons .",
    "the critical - density and cosmological constant models are normalized to cobe @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the other models , which has been computed relative to the latter , is almost correct .",
    "it includes the two main effects  that the early time matter power spectrum in low - density models is higher by a factor @xmath111 than in critical - density models is encoded in the initial conditions through the different initial value of @xmath45 , and the growth suppression factor from the scale factor dynamics is computed in the subsequent evolution .",
    "as each model ( except the critical - density one ) has the same redshift of matter  radiation equality , all that is omitted is the line - of - sight contribution to the sachs ",
    "wolfe effect , which requires a full boltzmann code for accurate computation .",
    "the effect of this term on the cobe normalization is non - existent for the critical - density case , and known to be negligible in the cosmological constant case ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "it may be slightly more significant for the decaying cosmological constant case @xcite and future observations would probably require an accurate computation , while present ones do not .",
    "we only show the power spectra for values of @xmath88 larger than @xmath104 . on smaller scales",
    "the amplitude of the power spectrum is gauge - dependent , though of course well - defined in any particular gauge .",
    "the results presented in this paper extend previous work on the effects of a presently - existing scalar field , with regard to the evolution of energy density perturbations in a pressureless fluid . in accordance with general covariance",
    "we allow for the presence of spatial perturbations in the scalar field .",
    "contrary to previous authors , we explicitly relate the energy density perturbations in the pressureless fluid to those in the scalar field through the adiabatic condition , as expected if those perturbations arose from a period of inflation in the very early universe .",
    "the study of the perturbation evolution was performed both in the zero - shear and uniform - curvature gauges , in the latter case for the first time .",
    "we considered two possible potentials for the scalar field , an exponential and that associated with a pseudo - nambu - goldstone - boson field .",
    "each of these potentials has two degrees of freedom , and we worked with two different sets of parameters for each potential . those models , exp2 and pngb2 , which were chosen so that the scalar field becomes dynamically important only very recently , at @xmath112 , and is presently behaving as a cosmological constant , yield a shape for the power spectrum of energy density perturbations in the matter component extremely close to that one obtains in a cosmological constant model where @xmath90 and @xmath85 , though the amplitude is a few percent smaller .",
    "the situation is rather different for the other two models , exp1 and pngb1 , chosen so that the scalar field becomes dynamically important at a much earlier time , around a redshift of 100 .",
    "they presently behave as pressureless matter . in the case of model",
    "exp1 the shape of the power spectrum of energy density perturbations in the matter component is again very close to that one obtains in a cosmological constant model , this time with @xmath90 and @xmath82 .",
    "its amplitude is however only about 5 per cent of that for the cosmological constant model .",
    "model pngb1 has the further interesting feature that the shape of @xmath107 is altered for values of @xmath88 below @xmath113 .",
    "unfortunately this corresponds to scales above around @xmath114 , at the limit of what present cluster and galaxy surveys can probe .",
    "the feature in the shape of @xmath107 for model pngb1 is due to oscillations in the rate of decrease of the hubble parameter when the scalar field becomes dynamically important at @xmath115 . on smaller scales",
    "the suppression of the growth of the energy density perturbations in the matter component is similar to that in model exp1 .",
    "the results just described suggest that the presence of spatial perturbations in a presently - existing scalar field substantially affects the evolution of energy density perturbations in the matter component only if the scalar field has contributed significantly to the total energy density in the universe for several hubble times .",
    "if the scalar field is becoming dynamically important only now , the presence of spatial perturbations does not seem to have much effect .",
    "the similarity between the scalar field models exp2 and pngb2 , and a flat model with @xmath90 , @xmath85 and no scalar field , makes the first two models attractive substitutes of the latter .",
    "further , given that the above mentioned flat model is able to reproduce all the most reliable observational data presently available on large - scale structure and cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropies @xcite , we expect models exp2 and pngb2 to do as well . as they are quite similar to the standard cosmological constant case , a detailed evaluation of the supernova constraint would be interesting ; frieman et al .",
    "@xcite suggest that the constraint will weaken so they should be viable .    with regard to models exp1 and pngb1 , their much smaller growth for the matter perturbations seems very problematic .",
    "we expect the dispersion of the density contrast smoothed on spheres of @xmath116 , usually represented by @xmath117 , required for both models so that they can reproduce the present abundance of high mass x - ray emitting galaxy clusters to be the same as for the critical - density case , due to the two models being dynamically equivalent to it since well before redshift 10 .",
    "this conservatively requires @xmath117 in the range 0.45 to 0.8 for both models @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "as the growth suppression factor of the matter perturbations is about 4.5 times larger in the exp1 and pngb1 models than in a flat model with @xmath90 and @xmath82 , to a first approximation this means that the value of @xmath117 implied by cobe for the two scalar field models would be about 4.5 times smaller than for the flat model @xcite .",
    "inclusion of the integrated sachs ",
    "wolfe effect may lead to a slight further decrease in @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "if the primordial power spectrum of energy density perturbations is assumed scale - invariant , then this would mean that @xmath118 for both exp1 and pngb1 @xcite",
    ". one would need a very ` blue ' primordial power spectrum , with at least @xmath119 , for @xmath117 to reach the minimum requirement of 0.45 .",
    "ferreira and joyce @xcite advocate a much larger value of @xmath120 , which resolves the amplitude problem but raises the question of whether the change in the shape of the spectrum can really be enough .",
    "we are presently carrying out a full investigation of all these models against a range of observational data .",
    "as in both exp1 and pngb1 the scalar field goes through a period at a redshift of about 100 when it behaves dynamically like a cosmological constant , we expect the full angular anisotropy spectrum for the cosmic microwave background radiation in these models to display a distinctive signature .",
    "this clearly merits detailed investigation .    as we were completing this paper , a preprint by caldwell et al .",
    "@xcite appeared which covers similar issues .",
    "they use an enhanced boltzmann code to generate microwave anisotropy power spectra .",

    "a cosmological perturbation is defined by means of a correspondence between an arbitrary background spacetime and the real physical universe .",
    "a _ gauge transformation _ is a change in this correspondence , keeping the background spacetime fixed .",
    "therefore , in general the value of the perturbed part of some physical quantity will not be invariant under a gauge transformation .",
    "further , the degrees of freedom due to gauge transformations give rise to spurious unphysical modes in the solutions to the evolution of the perturbed part of gauge - dependent quantities , which can always be removed by a convenient gauge transformation . in order to avoid these spurious modes one",
    "either evolves gauge - invariant quantities related to the gauge - dependent quantities one is actually interested in , obtaining the latter from the former at any one time , or one has to provide a gauge - fixing condition which completely specifies the way through which spacetime is to be split into background and perturbed components .",
    "the linear analysis of cosmological perturbations was initiated by lifshitz , with a seminal paper published in 1946 @xcite , who used the so - called synchronous gauge - fixing condition .",
    "unfortunately this condition , though considerably simplifying the perturbation equations , still leaves a residual gauge degree of freedom .",
    "the spurious modes thus arising are difficult to distinguish from the real physical ones , and their identification was a source of controversy for some time .",
    "the use of gauge - invariant quantities in the calculation of the evolution of cosmological perturbations only really took off with the paper by bardeen in 1980 @xcite .",
    "though it avoids the problem of obtaining unphysical modes in the solutions to the perturbation equations , it really does not offer any extra advantage over the gauge - specific methods which remove any gauge degree of freedom by completely fixing the background / perturbed splitting .    in this paper we will use gauge - specific methods to solve the perturbation equations .",
    "we will adopt the notation and use the equations laid down in a series of papers by hwang @xcite .",
    "we will be solely interested in the evolution of density ( scalar ) perturbations .",
    "the system is composed of an ideal fluid plus a single minimally coupled real scalar field , @xmath23 , evolving in a background einstein - de sitter universe .",
    "given that the spatial part of the background spacetime is thus homogeneous and isotropic , the perturbations in any physical quantities will necessarily be gauge - invariant under purely spatial gauge transformations .",
    "we will therefore only worry about the temporal gauge transformation .",
    "we will now introduce the gauge non - specific perturbation equations obtained by hwang .",
    "they relate the perturbed part of the metric variables , @xmath24 ( perturbed part of the lapse function ) , @xmath25 ( perturbed part of the spatial curvature ) , @xmath26 ( perturbed part of the shear ) and @xmath27 ( perturbed part of the expansion scalar ) , to the perturbed part of the matter variables , @xmath28 ( perturbed part of the total energy density ) , @xmath29 ( perturbed part of the total pressure ) to @xmath121 to avoid confusion with the number @xmath122 . ] and @xmath30 ( perturbed part of the total energy density flux , or total fluid four - velocity , depending on the frame chosen ) .",
    "we have @xmath123 and one can derive that @xcite @xmath124 where @xmath33 is the perturbed part of the scalar field",
    ". we will be particularly interested in the evolution of the fractional perturbation in the energy density of the ideal fluid , @xmath125 .",
    "we will express the perturbed parts of both the metric and matter variables by means of fourier expansions .",
    "for example , @xmath126 where @xmath127 being @xmath128 a fixed comoving wavenumber .",
    "the fourier expansions are made in a large enough box that the induced periodicity is irrelevant .",
    "as in this paper we are only interested in the linear evolution of cosmological perturbations , we will assume that the different fourier modes for each variable behave independently of each other .",
    "we will drop the suffices @xmath129 identifying each fourier mode in order to lighten the notation .    in the case of our system , formed by an ideal fluid plus a minimally coupled real scalar field ,",
    "the perturbation equations take the form @xcite , @xmath130\\,,\\\\ \\label{pert6 } \\dot{\\epsilon_{\\gamma}}+3h\\gamma\\epsilon_{\\gamma } & = &      \\gamma\\mu_{\\gamma}(\\kappa-3h\\alpha)+      \\frac{k^{2}}{a^{2}}\\psi_{\\gamma}\\,,\\\\ \\label{pert7 } \\dot{\\psi}_{\\gamma}+3h\\psi_{\\gamma } & = & -\\gamma\\mu_{\\gamma}\\alpha-      ( \\gamma-1)\\epsilon_{\\gamma}\\,,\\\\ \\label{pert8 } \\ddot{\\delta\\phi}+3h\\dot{\\delta\\phi}+\\left(\\frac{k^{2}}{a^{2}}+v,_{\\phi\\phi }      \\right ) \\delta\\phi & = & \\dot{\\phi}(\\kappa+\\dot{\\alpha } )      -(3h\\dot{\\phi}+2v,_{\\phi})\\alpha\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it should again be stressed that these equations were obtained without reference to any gauge - fixing condition .",
    "no anisotropic pressure term appears as in both the case of an ideal fluid and a minimally coupled real scalar field the anisotropic pressure is zero .",
    "the last three equations are , in order , the energy and momentum conservation equations for the perturbations in the ideal fluid , and the energy conservation equation for the perturbations in the scalar field .",
    "the momentum conservation equation for the perturbations in the scalar field is identically satisfied .",
    "the most obvious and fundamental gauge - fixing conditions follow from requiring that the perturbed part of one of the metric or matter variables is zero .",
    "we thus have : the synchronous gauge , @xmath131 ; the uniform - curvature gauge , @xmath132 ; the zero - shear gauge , @xmath133 ; the uniform - expansion gauge , @xmath134 ; the uniform - density gauge , @xmath135 ; the uniform - pressure gauge , @xmath136 ; and the comoving gauge , @xmath137 . except for the synchronous gauge , all the other gauge - fixing conditions",
    "completely remove the gauge modes from the solutions to the perturbation equations .",
    "we will use two of these gauge - fixing conditions to derive two different sets of perturbation equations from the system given above . with the aid of expressions relating quantities in the two gauges we will thus be able to estimate the numerical errors arising from the numerical integration of both sets of perturbation equations .",
    "we will consider the zero - shear gauge ( zsg , also known as the longitudinal or conformal newtonian gauge @xcite ) , and the uniform - curvature gauge ( ucg ) .",
    "these choices are the ones which lead to the two simplest sets of perturbation equations , thus decreasing the probability of numerical errors creeping into the solutions .",
    "the two sets can be obtained by simply getting rid of @xmath26 and @xmath138 in the case of the zsg , and @xmath25 and @xmath139 for the ucg , in eqs .",

    "derivatives with respect to the scale factor will be represented by a prime .",
    "we choose the independent variable to be the scale factor as it is easier to work with numerically and is more meaningful from the point of view of structure formation .",

    "<S> this has led to discussion of models where the cosmological ` constant ' decays with time , which might anyway be better motivated in a particle physics context . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest such models are based on scalar fields , and general covariance demands that a time - evolving scalar field also supports spatial perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the effect of such perturbations on the growth of adiabatic energy density perturbations in a cold dark matter component . </S>",
    "<S> we study two types of model , one based on an exponential potential for the scalar field and the other on a pseudo - nambu goldstone boson . for each potential , we study two different scenarios , one where the scalar field presently behaves as a decaying cosmological constant and one where it behaves as dust . </S>",
    "<S> the initial scalar field perturbations are fixed by the adiabatic condition , as expected from the inflationary cosmology , though in fact we show that the choice of initial condition is of little importance . </S>",
    "<S> calculations are carried out in both the zero - shear ( conformal newtonian ) and uniform - curvature gauges . </S>",
    "<S> we find that both potentials allow models which can provide a successful alternative to cosmological constant models .    </S>"
