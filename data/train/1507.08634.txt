    "accretion disks are of central importance to the formation and evolution of a wide range of astrophysical objects .",
    "if sufficiently ionized , such disks are subject to the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) , driving turbulence within the disk body .",
    "since the pioneering work of @xcite , numerical simulations have played a key role in establishing our current knowledge about the non - linearly saturated , turbulent state ( see * ? ? ? * for a review )  yet there remain substantial open questions regarding the saturation amplitude of the turbulent stresses , and their scaling with various input parameters .",
    "ideally , one would strive to simulate the accretion disk in its entirety , but the numerical requirements to treat _ turbulent _ magnetized disks globally are immense even by today s standards ( see * ? ? ? * for an estimate ) . both the grid resolution @xcite and the domain size @xcite have to be sufficient for obtaining converged results , and existing global models all have to make compromises of one sort or another .",
    "the need for global simulations ( necessary to properly describe the disk wind and jet ) on one hand , and the difficulty to resolve all relevant length scales ( necessary to obtain converged results for the turbulence ) on the other hand , strongly promotes the development of a so - called sub - grid - scale model ( in the vein of the large - eddy simulations pioneered by * ? ? ?",
    "such an approach can be regarded as mandatory when integration over long dynamical timescales is required , for instance to follow the secular evolution of the accretion disk , or the stability and symmetry of a protostellar jet @xcite .",
    "here we advocate a strategy where adequately resolved local shearing - box models with varying shear rate , @xmath3 , and net - vertical flux ( nvf ) are employed to derive an _ effective _ parametrization of mri - generated turbulence with the prospect of later inserting this into global simulations as a sub - grid - scale model .",
    "early phenomenological descriptions for the turbulent stresses @xcite included the effects of the background shear but ignored any large - scale fields .",
    "these phenomenological approaches typically involve a certain number of unconstrained order - unity coefficients . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have made first attempts to restrict various closure coefficients in heuristic approaches , such as the @xcite stress model , from direct simulations , pioneering an important future route . @xcite",
    "have tested such shear - stress relations against global relativistic simulations , and derive a prescription where the turbulent stress depends on radius . starting from the early phenomenological models , @xcite included for the first time a driving term akin to the linear mri assuming a constant net - vertical flux .",
    "notably , this simple model already produces a scaling of the maxwell - to - reynolds stress ratio according to @xmath4 as a function of the dimensionless shear parameter @xcite , as well as the total stress as a function of shear @xcite .",
    "the former relation had previously been found in unstratified mri simulations by @xcite .",
    "this correspondence may indicate that the linear modes remain important even when affected by turbulent dissipation . addressing questions related to the transport properties of the emerging turbulent flow , @xcite have recently revisited the subject of shear - rate dependence in mri turbulence .",
    "the authors confirm the scaling of the turbulent stresses with the shear - to - vorticity ratio @xmath5 , first suggested by @xcite , as well as the relation of @xcite quoted above .",
    "while the mentioned approaches primarily focus on the momentum equation , ideally a closure model should also encapsulate the effects of small - scale turbulence ( _ via _ the induction equation ) onto the long - term evolution of the large - scale field threading the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "the relative importance of the turbulent diffusivity versus the turbulent viscosity has previously been assessed in unstratified mri simulations .",
    "it is crucial to appreciate that a large - scale field acts as a net flux locally @xcite and thus determines the driving of turbulence via linear mri  in turn affecting the local value of turbulent transport coefficients governing the redistribution of angular momentum @xcite . beyond linear mri",
    ", the variability in disk coronae may be a consequence of the emergence of large - scale azimuthal field @xcite , and the long - term radial evolution of the net - vertical flux @xcite may have important implications for the potential driving of a disk wind ( see discussion in * ? ? ? * ) , although had found that a sufficiently strong dynamo can support outflows even in the absence of significant vertical fields .",
    "the importance of mean - field effects is now also witnessed in global simulations @xcite that show the same cyclic behavior of the azimuthally - averaged magnetic fields that had previously been observed in local boxes only ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "related to this , @xcite have recently argued that the quasi - periodic character of the disk dynamo ( which they trigger by hand ) may be reflected in episodic ejection events , which can be observed as knots along the jet axis .    as with the turbulent stresses ,",
    "a promising route to nurturing our insight is to understand the parameter dependence of the various transport coefficients .",
    "initiated by the numerical result of @xcite , who found an exponential amplification of large - scale fields in unstratified shear flow , the role of shear in generating correlations in the mean electromotive force has received renewed interest @xcite .",
    "the shear - rate dependence of the dynamo @xmath0  effect in mri turbulence was first studied by , who inferred a ( pseudo- ) scalar @xmath0 simply as the ratio of the electromotive force ( emf ) to the mean field  hence ignoring any contributions via a tensorial @xmath0  effect , and/or the turbulent diffusivity , @xmath1 .",
    "the numerical study of was prompted by the theoretical work of , who predicted that the _ negative _",
    "@xmath0  effect @xcite would only exist in a narrow range of the shear parameter .",
    "we are able to confirm this prediction , but also show that this `` buoyant '' @xmath0  effect is probably _ not _",
    "responsible for the cyclic patterns seen in space - time diagrams of the mean horizontal magnetic field .",
    "for the _ positive _",
    "@xmath0  effect , however , we find a linear dependence on shear , which nicely explains the cycle period that we infer from our simulations as a function of the shear rate  albeit _ not _ the direction of propagation .",

    "bottom : _ shear - rate dependence of the maxwell - to - reynolds stress ratio .",
    "the dotted lines indicate scaling , @xmath6 , introduced by @xcite . ]",
    "the second theme of our investigation is the nvf - dependence of ( i ) the turbulent stress and ( ii ) the dynamo coefficients .",
    "in contrast to unstratified nvf simulations ( that find a near linear scaling , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but agreeing with results of global stratified simulations of @xcite , we observe a shallow power - law relation between the transport coefficients and the net - vertical flux . if one excludes the strong - field regime where vigorous overturning motions disrupt the vertical disk structure , the dynamo coefficients are found to be surprisingly insensitive to the amount of net - vertical field .    the third subject of our paper concerns non - locality in the transport coefficients . in a seminal paper ,",
    "@xcite first pointed out the possibility of scale - dependent @xmath0 and @xmath1 tensors , and obtained the first results for stratified mri turbulence .",
    "even though their approach was partly hampered by very noisy data , their derived scale - dependent dynamo model provided a better fit to the simulations in terms of the cycle period . the aspect of scale - dependence  or alternatively , of the non - locality in the relation between the electromotive forces and the mean magnetic field",
    "can naturally be expressed within the test - field ( tf ) framework , where a wavenumber is typically assigned to the tf inhomogeneity .",
    "varying this wavenumber , first introduced a scale - dependent version of the tf method .",
    "the authors have furthermore obtained the shape of the convolution kernel that expresses the non - locality of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 effects for the cases of simple prescribed flows , and for forced isotropic turbulence .",
    "we here apply this approach to the case of stratified mri simulations and obtain , for the first time simultaneously , the scale - dependence of the mean - field coefficients along with their vertical profile .",
    "the knowledge of these functional dependencies will enable new , quantitative mean - field models .",
    "while we here restrict ourselves to an isothermal equation of state , it should be remarked that allowing for redistribution of heat via strong convective motions @xcite , the efficiency of the dynamo can be drastically affected @xcite , potentially explaining the enhanced turbulent transport related to transient accretion outbursts @xcite and variability in the inner regions of protoplanetary disks @xcite . in view of devising a comprehensive mean - field model of large - scale field evolution , this has the dramatic repercussion that such a model would be required to encapsulate the disk thermodynamics .    as a final introductory remark",

    "* ) , we focus our attention to the rayleigh stable regime , @xmath7 .",
    "our simulations beyond this value showed exponential growth of @xmath8 modes .",
    "this is expected from linear theory @xcite , and the loss of the local character of the instability clearly precludes the use of the shearing box .    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : methods ] describes the numerical method and computational set - up and introduces the test - field concept . in section  [ sec : q - dep ] we discuss the shear - rate dependence , and in section  [ sec : cycle ] we demonstrate how this affects the cycle period of the dynamo .",

    "the smaller box size compared to , for instance , the recent study of @xcite  who used a box with @xmath21 at a resolution of @xmath22  is chosen to accommodate for a larger number of simulations , and a longer simulation time of typically 800 orbits ( with period @xmath23 ) .",

    "the studied quantities are typically converged at the 2040% level ( also cf .",

    "we note that we consciously neglect explicit viscous or resistive terms and rely on the truncation error of our numerical scheme to approximate the effects of small - scale energy dissipation .",

    "even though the numerical timestep may in practice be restricted by the alfvn speed high up in the disk corona ( especially in models with a net - vertical field ) , we nevertheless apply an orbital advection scheme ( cf . * ? ? ?",

    "we remark that , in situations with a strong nvf , the mass loss per orbit can approach 100% of the mass contained within the box .",
    "nevertheless , such a replenishing of material can be thought of as a natural consequence of radial mass transport within a global disk if the system is in a quasi - stationary state on average . for the magnetic field",
    ", we use the standard normal - field @xmath45 ( sometimes referred to as `` pseudo - vacuum '' ) boundary condition in the vertical direction . forcing the horizontal field to zero at the vertical boundaries",

    "one central objective of this paper is to study how the dynamo closure coefficients of the mean - field dynamo depend on various input parameter such as the shear - rate and the strength of the applied net - vertical field . as in previous work",

    "the measurement procedure is in fact similar to the approach used by , who impose a sinusoidal magnetic field perturbation and infer the correlation between the resulting electromotive force and the current .",
    "the difference in the tf method is that the perturbation is _ virtual _ in the sense that the simulation remains unaware of the applied field .",

    "the inclusion of a significant net - vertical magnetic field affects the amplitude of the turbulent stresses  yet not as dramatically as in unstratified simulations ( compare fig .  [",
    "fig : nvf_stress ] with fig .  2 in * ?",
    "* ) . for our simulation setup",
    ", we find a threshold value of @xmath209 , expressed in the midplane plasma parameter . for values smaller than this ( i.e. , for stronger fields ) , we find an approximate scaling with @xmath210 .",
    "inclusion of the nvf appears to have a varying effect on the various tensor components .",
    "we observe some of the coefficients , such as @xmath76 , and @xmath79 , to be significantly enhanced for stronger nvf .",
    "the key coefficient @xmath83 entering the @xmath2  cycle , however , shows the opposite trend , and is weakly quenched for strong fields .",
    "a similar dichotomy applies to the turbulent diffusivity , represented by @xmath94 , which shows a weak quenching near the disk midplane , and is slightly anti - quenched in the upper disk layers .",
    "we interpret the observed characteristic to be caused by the faster removal timescale due to the stronger wind for higher nvf , such that correlations ( caused primarily by the coriolis effect ) have shorter time to build - up in models with stronger nvf and hence a stronger wind . the advective helicity flux @xcite will of course also scale with the outflow velocity , offering an alternative potential explanation for the observed behavior .      motivated by the paper of @xcite , and with the technological advancement introduced by , we have obtained the scale - dependence of the @xmath0  effect , and turbulent @xmath1 , for stratified , isothermal mri turbulence with unprecedented fidelity .",
    "@xcite for instance found @xmath211 ( see their figure  12 ) .",
    "in contrast , we find both components of comparable magnitude .",
    "this is likely explained by their assumption of negligible off - diagonal contributions during the inversion process , which is however not warranted in view of our tf results that show @xmath212 . without this restrictive assumption ,",
    "@xcite find unphysical negative diffusivities for the coefficient affecting the radial magnetic field component ( see their figure 10 ) , indicating an inherent problem with their original approach .",
    "using the spectral tf method , for the @xmath83 tensor element , we find a wavenumber dependence @xmath213 with a characteristic wavenumber of @xmath191 ( in units of @xmath119 ) at a disk height of @xmath214 . the lorentzian shape in @xmath215  space has first been identified by and , and also appears in passive scalar diffusion ( see sect .",
    "iii.c of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for the eddy diffusivity @xmath216",
    ", we find a similar dependence , but with @xmath193 ( in the magnetically dominated corona ) , and @xmath217 ( near the disk midplane ) .",
    "this illustrates that the non - locality in the relation between the mean magnetic field and the emf manifests itself differently in different regions of the disk , and this is the first time that both the vertical functional dependence _ and _ the scale - dependence of these effects has been derived simultaneously , adding credibility to their mutual consistency ( see the concerns in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with the dominant wavenumber of the mean - field dynamo estimated at @xmath118 , and @xmath218",
    ", we infer a scale separation close to one order of magnitude , which comfortably merits a mean - field description  yet not without concerns that non - local effects may potentially affect the properties of the emerging dynamo solution .",
    "its ability to quantitatively explain the period of the observed cyclic field patterns ( as a function of shear rate ) encourages to further explore the @xmath2  mechanism as a key player in the long - term evolution and dynamics of magnetized accretion disks .",
    "the unambiguous determination of the inherent scale - dependence in the dynamo tensors furthermore instigates a new investigation into more realistic non - local mean - field models . @xcite",
    "have already established that such an approach does affect properties of the butterfly diagram in simpler settings .",
    "a number of issues need to be understood along the way , such as the largely unknown ( anti- ) quenching behavior of the mean - field coefficients in the case of a dynamically important lorentz force ( even including the possibility of spontaneous symmetry breaking ; * ? ? ?",
    "a stronger @xmath0  effect for stronger mean fields was , for instance , argued to potentially explain the steep scaling of the dynamo cycle period , @xmath134 , with the rotation frequency observed in stellar dynamos .",
    "alternatively , one can strive to include the effects of the lorentz force explicitly .",
    "the latter route would require to extend the mean - field approach to the momentum equation  something that can be regarded as mandatory if one wants to include the modeling of turbulent stresses @xcite .",
    "additionally , dynamical constraints from the conservation of magnetic helicity ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent account ) may govern at least part of the dynamics ( as witnessed by the dynamically quenched mean - field model of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "before global simulations were feasible , a large body of work employed the local shearing - box approximation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* to mention two influential ones ) to obtain bulk properties of mri turbulence . in this paper",
    ", we also heavily rely on the shearing - box as a workhorse for studying differentially rotating turbulence . the renewed realization @xcite of the importance of outflows _  la _",
    "@xcite challenges the usefulness of the local approximation , where some properties of the outflow are affected by spurious box - size effects . while this may also partly affect our results with strong net - vertical fields",
    ", we nevertheless argue that only _ combining _ local and global models can ultimately solve the puzzle of understanding turbulent accretion disks .",
    "all in all , the approach presented in this paper appears to be a sensible first step in a program to build a mean - field framework for turbulent flows that will enable to follow the secular evolution of global disk dynamics .",
    "the fact that the properties of the turbulent dynamics , as well as the butterfly pattern , seen in local simulations are also observed in global simulations @xcite lends support to this approach .",
