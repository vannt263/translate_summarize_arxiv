    "in recent studies of the most metal - poor stars known , an interesting trend has been discovered regarding the abundance of carbon .",
    "several authors have noted that roughly 25% of the most metal - poor stars studied exhibit strong enhancements of carbon , as reflected in the unusual strength of their ch g - band features .",
    "these carbon - enhanced metal - poor ( cemp ) stars occur with such a large frequency that one is forced to consider the implications on the nature of possible production mechanisms of carbon in the early universe .",
    "over the metallicity range @xmath5 [ fe / h ] @xmath6 , there exists an upper limit to the level of carbon enhancement amongst cemp stars at [ c / h ] @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this immediately suggests that at some early time in the universe a significant amount of carbon was produced , in all likelihood by one of the following sources : ( 1 ) a _ primordial _ mechanism from massive stellar progenitors , ( 2 ) _ intrinsic _ internal production by low - mass stars of extremely low [ fe / h ] , or ( 3 ) _ extrinsic _ production of carbon by stars of intermediate mass , which can be prodigious manufacturers of carbon during their agb stages , followed by mass transfer to a surviving lower - mass companion .",
    "indeed , it remains possible that all three sources might play a role .",
    "the first alternative , in which the observed levels of carbon in at least some of the cemp stars is primordial , or close to primordial , and was produced in the first generations of ( presumably quite massive ) stars , receives some support from models of element production in zero metal abundance stars in the mass range 18  30 @xmath7 @xcite . in this scenario a large amount of carbon was produced early on , and then not as prodigiously after that .",
    "the second possibility is that , early in the universe , when there were few heavy elements present , unusually effective mixing episodes triggered at the time of helium core flash dredges up internally produced carbon and deposits it on the surfaces of low - mass stars @xcite .",
    "the final alternative is that intermediate - mass stars ( e.g. , @xmath8 ) in binary pairs with lower - mass companions , quickly evolved , producing large amounts of carbon during their agb evolution .",
    "then , a significant amount of this carbon - rich material was transferred to the long - lived companion , via roche - lobe overflow or a wind .",
    "the lower - mass companion is presently observed to be carbon - rich , while the higher - mass carbon - producing star is now a faint white dwarf ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this scenario",
    ", one would expect to be able to detect the presence of the binary system , either directly through high - angular - resolution observations , or indirectly by detecting the tell - tale wobble in the orbit of the visible companion .",
    "in order to investigate these different scenarios , new medium - resolution spectroscopic data has been gathered , with a variety of 2m-4 m class telescopes , for over 350 stars in the large sample of carbon - rich stars reported by christlieb et al .",
    "it should be kept in mind that this sample of stars was selected based , not on metallicity , but rather , on the apparent level of carbon enhancement revealed in low - resolution objective - prism specta . as a result ,",
    "only those metal - poor stars which exhibited enhancement of carbon were selected , resulting in a determination of the upper limit of carbon enhancement , without restricting the metallicity range .",
    "these data allow for the determination of reasonably accurate estimates of carbon abundances ( and [ fe / h ] ) for the christlieb et al .",
    "carbon - rich stars , using techniques described by rossi et al . @xcite .",
    "the calibration of rossi et al .",
    ", based on the kp and gp indices described by beers et al .",
    "@xcite , in combination with de - reddened @xmath9 colors obtained from the 2mass survey @xcite , achieves accuracies of @xmath10 dex for [ fe / h ] and @xmath11 dex for [ c / fe ] , respectively .",
    "figure 1 shows the derived abundances that have been obtained to date for a subset of the christlieb et al .",
    "carbon - rich stars .",
    "roughly 50% of the carbon - enhanced candidates proved to be very metal - deficient stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath12 , in other words , they are cemp stars .",
    "the remainder appear to be stars of higher metallicity , up to and including solar .",
    "these latter stars may be examples of intermediate - mass intrinsic agb stars , whose presence in the halo of the galaxy might well be accounted for by stripping from dwarf galaxies such as sagittarius @xcite .     with declining [ fe / h ] .",
    "these stars were selected as carbon - enhanced , independent of metallicity .",
    "the upper envelope of abundances correspond to [ c / h ] = @xmath13 .",
    "note that abundances have not yet been determined for stars more metal - rich that [ fe / h ] = @xmath13.,width=377,height=226 ]    in addition to elemental abundances , radial velocities have been obtained for most of these candidates .",
    "around half of these stars have velocites consistent with membership of the general halo population .",
    "the remainders are a mix of high- and low - velocity stars , some of which are likely members of the metal - weak thick disk @xcite , while others are possibly associated with the sagittarius stream ."
