    "infrared surveys have identified more than a thousand nearby star systems for which infrared excesses beyond @xmath1 m reveal circumstellar dust produced from the collisional grinding and destruction of small planetesimals .",
    "the amount of dust generally decreases with age because small grains are removed by radiation pressure and poynting - robertson drag . without gas to retard their removal , circumstellar grains typically possess lifetimes of 10,000 yr , which is significantly shorter than the age of the star .",
    "these circumstances suggest that the grains are replenished from a reservoir of unseen planetesimals such as asteroids or comets , which are perturbed into orbits that lead to dust - generating collisions .",
    "coronagraphic imaging of debris disks has revealed structures such as localized brightness peaks , asymmetries , and warps that suggest the presence of formed or forming planets @xcite .",
    "the first three systems with directly imaged exoplanets ( fomalhaut , hr  8799 , and @xmath2  pictoris ; @xcite ) are all stars previously known to host debris disks .",
    "for instance , recent ground - based , high - contrast imaging has discovered a @xmath3 planet orbiting 813  au from @xmath2  pictoris that is consistent with a warp or secondary disk observed in scattered light @xcite .",
    "modeling the dynamical effects inferred from scattered - light morphologies places constraints on the architectures of exoplanetary systems @xcite .",
    "models based solely on spectral - energy distributions ( seds ) are inherently degenerate , so direct images are essential to locate the dust and planetesimal belts ( the analogs of our asteroid and kuiper belts ) unambiguously .",
    "furthermore , models based only on assumptions about grain sizes and compositions yield disk radii and dust masses that may vary by an order of magnitude @xcite . however , multi - band scattered - light images of the disks provide measurements of the colors , phase functions , and albedos of the dust that can be used by the models to constrain the physical properties of the dust grains @xcite .",
    "only 23 debris disks have published spatially resolved detections in scattered light as of early 2014 , primarily using coronagraphs aboard the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this subset of known debris disks comprises the 16 disks listed in table 1 of @xcite , hd 202628 @xcite , hip 79977 @xcite , and the five disks reported in this _ letter_. scattered - light images typically possess higher angular resolution than images in thermal emission , and their increased sensitivity to micron - sized particles at large distances from the star provides more detailed information about the spatial distribution of the smallest dust grains .",
    "together , scattered - light and thermal - emission images can be used to constrain the azimuthal dependence of the dust density distribution and the properties of the constituent grains ( e.g. , composition , size , porosity ) .",
    "the principal difficulty with obtaining such images of disks or planets  even with the highly stable _ hst _ coronagraphs or the latest generation of specialized ground - based instruments ( gpi , sphere , project 1640 , hiciao ) @xcite or the _ james webb space telescope ( jwst ) _ nircam and miri coronagraphs @xcite  is the large contrast between the faint scattered light from the disk and the much brighter halo of starlight from the instrumental point - spread function ( psf ) . the residual starlight must be precisely calibrated and subtracted during image processing .",
    "recent advances in coronagraphic image processing have been made through the development of sophisticated algorithms for removing the residual diffracted light , which utilize large libraries of reference coronagraphic stellar psfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , we initiated the archival legacy investigation of circumstellar environments ( alice ) project to reprocess comprehensively and consistently archived images from various _",
    "hst_/nicmos coronagraphic surveys for faint circumstellar companions .",
    "this program uses the karhunen - love image projection ( klip ) algorithm @xcite and the large number of reference stars available in the _ hst _ archive .",
    "klip not only decreases computational costs incurred from previous optimization methods , but also improves the ability to detect circumstellar disks by greatly mitigating the disk self - subtraction problem that plagued earlier algorithms .",
    "our alice pipeline improves the coronagraphic detection limit for point sources by at least an order of magnitude over classical psf subtraction methods . for disk images ,",
    "most of the improvement is obtained at small separations , as demonstrated in figure [ fig : klip ] for the previously imaged debris disk around hd  181327 @xcite .    in this _ letter _ , we report some of the first results from alice : spatially resolved images of five debris disks that were previously undetected in archived nicmos data .",
    "four of these disks have never before been imaged in scattered light . the disk around hd  202917 was previously detected by the _",
    "hst _ advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) guaranteed time observer team and reported by @xcite at the 2007 spirit of lyot conference . the images and analyses presented here",
    "first looks \" at these systems .",
    "each image warrants more in depth analysis , and detailed follow - up papers are in preparation .",
    "between _ hst _ cycles 7 and 15 , a total of 215 _ hst _ orbits were devoted to six nicmos surveys and searches for debris disks .",
    "the five star ",
    "disk systems newly resolved by alice ( figure [ fig:5disks ] ) were identified from data obtained by these programs ( table 1 ) . although the principal goal of the alice project is detecting faint companions in these nicmos data , the advanced starlight subtraction enabled by the klip algorithm has allowed us to also detect extended scattered light from disks with unprecedented sensitivity .",

    "starlight subtraction can be improved considerably by using a linear combination of many reference images to synthesize an optimal reference psf ( e.g. , loci ; * ? ? ?",
    "a library of references can be assembled either by observing a large number of reference stars or by introducing observational diversity , such as angular or spectral differential imaging @xcite .",
    "subsequent variants of loci have modified the optimization parameters for better performance in these various regimes @xcite .",
    "more recently , new optimization techniques based on principal component analysis ( pca ) , such as the klip algorithm used in the alice pipeline , have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the use of such advanced optimization techniques is particularly well suited to _ hst _ archival research , as a large library of reference stars already exists .",
    "the _ hst _ archival program entitled `` legacy archive psf library and circumstellar environments '' ( laplace ) recently recalibrated the entire nicmos coronagraphic archive from cycle 7 through cycle 15 @xcite .",
    "laplace improved on prior calibrations by using contemporary flat - field frames and observed dark frames ( instead of epochal flats and synthetic darks ) and by implementing better bad - pixel correction .",
    "laplace also provided important ancillary information about each target star ( e.g. , its position behind the coronagraphic mask and its @xmath8 magnitudes ) that facilitates the selection and normalization of reference images .",
    "we use the klip algorithm to decompose the laplace reference psf library into an orthogonal basis of eigen - images via a karhunen - love transform and then truncate that basis to retain the @xmath9 modes with the highest weights .",
    "a synthetic reference psf model is computed from vector projections of the actual science images into the truncated pca basis .",
    "the modeled psfs are then subtracted from the science images .",
    "the alice pipeline provides tools for selecting optimal reference star subsets and number of modes @xmath9 for each subtraction .",
    "in addition to klip processing , alice uses iterative roll subtraction @xcite to enhance the disk detection when combining data from multiple spacecraft orients .",
    "figure [ fig:5disks ] shows the nicmos images of the five stars listed in table  1 processed through the alice pipeline that reveal scattered - light disks extending to angular distances of @xmath10@xmath11 from each star .",
    "all five disks are seen in images obtained at two _ hst _ roll orientations , and the two disks ( hd  141943 and hd  202917 ) for which multi - band archival data is available are seen in both bandpasses ( f110w and f160w ) .",
    "only f110w images are shown in figure [ fig:5disks ] for consistency between all targets and because the f110w images have better angular resolution and sensitivity .",
    "also shown are maps of the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "the noise is calculated from a representative ensemble of reference stars with non - detections that were processed consistently with the science targets ( i.e. subtracted using the same number of pca modes , rotated , combined ) .",
    "these references are used to build a pixel - to - pixel noise covariance matrix and estimate the noise variance at every position within the same aperture as used for signal extraction ( two resolution elements in diameter ) .",
    "these are the same methods as being implemented for jwst coronagraphy ( pontoppidan et al . in prep ; pueyo et al . in prep ) .",
    "the snr displayed in figure 2 illustrates the statistical confidence of our disk detections with respect to the larger ensemble of sources processed by the alice program .",
    "this approach rigorously accounts for both temporal variations and spatial correlations ( e.g. speckles or diffraction spike subtraction residuals ) .",
    "while the snr in any individual location is modest in these data , the integrated snr over each disk image is statistically robust .",
    "the surface brightnesses shown in figure [ fig:5disks ] are lower limits due to the throughput and zero - mean output of the klip algorithm . indeed",
    "the disk itself can contribute non - negligibly to the mean image .",
    "these effects can be well calibrated using forward modeling @xcite , but such modeling is beyond the scope of this paper and is deferred to separate detailed analyses of the disks in subsequent papers . in any case",
    "these surface brightness estimates should be close within less than a factor 2 , based on the example shown in figure 1 where the klip image surface brightness is @xmath12 of the classical psf subtraction image .",
    "see also figure 2 in @xcite for an estimate of the algorithm throughput .",
    "the five disks surround f and g stars whose ages ( @xmath13 myr ) correspond to the epoch of terrestrial planet formation in our solar system .",
    "the systems lie in an important region in spectral - type - versus - age space ( figure [ fig : agetype ] ) , as only three debris disks have been previously imaged in scattered light around f or g stars younger than 100 myr .",
    "figure [ fig : seds ] shows the seds of the star  disk systems , which have fractional dust luminosities of @xmath14 that are typical for young systems .",
