    "since about two years , the field of relativistic heavy - ion collisions is in a unique and unprecedented situation .",
    "it benefits from a wealth of high quality results obtained by five large experiments in operation at two outstanding and complementary facilities .",
    "rhic started operation in the year 2000 and has demonstrated unique flexibility and capabilities in delivering beams at a very broad energy range from the top energy at @xmath0  =  200  gev  down to @xmath0 = 7 gev and providing collisions of a large variety of species pp , da , cucu , auau and recently u+u as well as asymmetric collisions like cu+au .",
    "the lhc at cern started a most fruitful heavy ion program in 2010 opening a new energy frontier with the study of pb+pb collisions at @xmath0 = 2.76 tev .",
    "the program is carried out by five large experiments , phenix and star at rhic and alice , atlas and cms at the lhc .",
    "the emphasis is on precise studies to characterize the properties of the strongly interacting quark gluon plasma ( sqgp ) discovered at rhic .",
    "the study of many observables over two to three orders of magnitude in energy provide strong contraints and valuable guidance in the development of theoretical models . in the limited space of this paper",
    "it is not possible to do justice to all the recent developments in the field .",
    "the paper is therefore restricted to recent results on a few topics including flow , energy loss and direct photons .",
    "the study of flow is a main focus of interest .",
    "it has the potential to address tranport properties of the plasma like the shear viscosity to entropy ratio ( @xmath1/s ) , the speed of sound etc .",
    "of particular interest is the detailed comparison of the flow parameters at rhic and lhc energies which could reveal differences in the plasma formed at these two energy regimes .",
    "the average elliptic flow of inclusive charged hadrons in the 20 - 30% centrality class increases by @xmath225% from rhic to lhc ( see left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : v2-roots ] ) @xcite .",
    "this increase mainly reflects the observed increase in the average p@xmath3 of the charged hadrons rather than an increase of the differential elliptic flow v@xmath4(p@xmath3 ) .",
    "the latter is in fact remarkably constant from rhic to lhc as demonstrated in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : v2-roots ] that compares the differential elliptic flow of charged hadrons measured by alice and star @xcite .",
    "the differential elliptic flow of charged hadrons is also remarkably constant at lower energies , from 200 down to 39 gev , as demonstrated by the phenix measurements @xcite shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : v2-roots ] .",
    "the saturation of v@xmath4(p@xmath3 ) at , or below , @xmath0 = 39 gev suggests that the perfect liquid property of the sqgp discovered at rhic is valid from this low energy up to at least 2.76  tev .",
    "at rhic , the saturation of v@xmath4(p@xmath3 ) for charged hadrons is also observed for identified hadrons ( @xmath5 ) in the energy range @xmath0 = 39 - 200 gev . at lhc",
    "the situation is less clear .",
    "the observed saturation of v@xmath4(p@xmath3 ) for unidentified charged hadrons could be fortuitous and result from higher v@xmath4(p@xmath3 ) values at the lhc compared to rhic for @xmath6 and and @xmath7 compensated by lower v@xmath4(p@xmath3 ) values for @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the differences are relatively small , of the order of 20% , but if confirmed they could signal small differences in the properties of the sqgp formed at the lhc compared to the one formed at rhic .",
    "the valence quark scaling observed at rhic seems also to work at the lhc although deviations are observed for protons @xcite .",

    "the large v@xmath4  values of direct photons is a surprising and challenging result .",
    "the direct photon yield at low p@xmath3   is dominated by the excess mentioned above that is interpreted as thermal radiation from the sqgp",
    ". however thermal radiation implies early emission whereas a large v@xmath4  implies late emission .",
    "assuming that all measurements are correct , these two seemingly contradicting features call for a revision of the current interpretation of the results .",

    "the field of relativistic heavy ion physics is now in a phase of precision measurements to characterize the properties of the sqgp .",
    "only a few topics could be discussed in the limited scope of this paper , covering the most recent results on flow , energy loss and direct photons .",
    "the field benefits from unique opportunities offered by five large experiments operating at two large facilities and producing high quality and complementary data .",
    "results are obtained at unprecedented rate and considerable progress should be achieved in the next few years .",
