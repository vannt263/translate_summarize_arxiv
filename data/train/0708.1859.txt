    "analogue to digital ( a / d ) conversion is a technique where the input signal is highly oversampled before being quantized by a low resolution quantizer .",
    "the quantization noise is then processed by a noise shaping filter which reduces the energy of the so - called in - band noise spectrum , i.e.  the part of the noise spectrum which overlaps the spectrum of the input signal .",
    "the end result is high bit - accuracy ( a / d ) conversion even in the presence of imperfections in the analogue components of the system , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the process of oversampling and use of feedback to reduce quantization noise is not limited to a / d conversion of continuous - time signals but is in fact equally applicable to , for example , discrete time signals in which case we will use the term delta - sigma quantization .",
    "hence , given a discrete time signal we can apply delta - sigma quantization in order to discretize the amplitude of the signal and thereby obtain a digital signal .",
    "it should be clear that the process of oversampling is not required in order to obtain a digital signal .",
    "however , oversampling leads to a controlled amount of redundancy in the digital signal .",
    "this redundancy can be exploited in order to achieve a certain degree of robustness against inaccuracy in the quantization , or partial loss of information due to transmission of the digital signal over error - prone channels . in this paper",
    "we pursue the latter aspect , and relate it to the problem of multiple descriptions .    in the information theory community the problem of quantization is usually referred to as a source coding problem whereas the problem of reliable transmission is referred to as a channel coding problem .",
    "their combination then forms a joint source - channel coding problem .",
    "the multiple - description ( md ) problem  @xcite , which has recently received a lot of attention , is basically a joint source - channel coding problem .",
    "the md problem is concerned with lossy encoding of information for transmission over an unreliable @xmath0-channel communication system .",
    "the channels may break down resulting in erasures and a loss of information at the receiving side .",
    "the receiver knows which subset of the @xmath0 channels is working ; the transmitter does not .",
    "the problem is then to design an md system which , for given channel rates , minimizes the distortions due to reconstruction of the source using information from any subsets of the channels .",
    "currently , the achievable md rate - distortion region is only completely known for the case of two channels , squared - error fidelity criterion and a memoryless gaussian source  @xcite .",
    "the bounds of  @xcite have been extended to stationary and smooth sources in  @xcite , where they were proven to be asymptotically tight at high resolution .",
    "inner and outer bounds to the rate - distortion region for the case of @xmath1 channels were presented in  @xcite but it is not known whether any of the bounds are tight for @xmath1 channels .",
    "the earliest practical md schemes , which were shown to be asymptotically optimal at high resolution and large lattice vector quantizer dimensions , were based on the principle of index assignments , cf .",
    "unfortunately , the existing methods for constructing index assignments in high vector dimensions are complex and computationally demanding . to avoid the difficulty of designing efficient index assignments , it was suggested in  @xcite that the index assignments of a two - description system can be replaced by successive quantization and linear estimation .",
    "more specifically , the two side descriptions can be linearly combined and further enhanced by a refinement layer to yield the central reconstruction .",
    "the design of  @xcite suffers from a rate loss of 0.5 bit / dim .  at high resolution and is therefore not able to achieve the md rate - distortion bound .",
    "recently , however , this gap was closed by chen et al .",
    "@xcite who recognized that the rate region of the md problem forms a polymatroid , and showed that the corner points of this rate region can be achieved by successive estimation and quantization .",
    "the design of chen et al .",
    "is inherently _ asymmetric _ in the description rate since any corner point of a non - trivial rate region will lead to asymmetric rates . to symmetrize the coding rates , it is necessary either to time - share between corner points , or to break the quantization process into additional stages , which is a method known as `` source splitting '' ( following urbanke and rimoldi s rate splitting approach for the multiple access channel ) .",
    "when finite - dimensional quantizers are employed , there is a space - filling loss due to the fact that the quantizer s voronoi cells are finite dimensional and not completely spherical ,  @xcite , and as such each description suffers a rate loss .",
    "the rate loss of the design given in  @xcite is that of @xmath2 quantizers because source splitting is performed by using an additional @xmath3 quantizers besides the conventional @xmath0 side quantizers",
    ". moreover , in the two - description scalar deterministic case , the rate loss can be further reduced , cf .",
    "@xcite . ]",
    "an interesting open question is : can we avoid both the complexity of the index assignments and the extra space - filling loss due to source splitting in symmetric md coding ?    inspired by the works presented in  @xcite , we present a two - channel md scheme based on two times oversampled dithered delta - sigma quantization , which is inherently symmetric in the description rate and as such there is no need for source splitting . the rate loss when employing finite - dimensional quantizers ( in parallel ) is therefore given by that of two quantizers .",
    "the side - to - central distortion ratio is controlled by the noise shaping filter ; the more `` high - pass '' the noise is , the larger is the side - to - central distortion ratio .",
    "asymptotically as the dimension of the vector quantizer and order of the noise shaping filter approach infinity , we show that the symmetric two - channel md rate - distortion function for a memoryless gaussian source and mse fidelity criterion can be achieved at any resolution .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that our design is not limited to two descriptions but , in fact , an arbitrary number of descriptions can be created simply by increasing the oversampling ratio . however , in this paper , we only prove optimality for the case of two descriptions .    in the delta - sigma quantization literature",
    "there seems to be a consensus of avoiding long feedback filters .",
    "we suspect this is mainly due to the fact that the quantization error in traditional delta - sigma quantization is a deterministic non - linear function of the input signal , which makes it difficult to perform an exact system analysis .",
    "thus , there might be concerns regarding the stability of the system . in our work",
    "we use dithered ( lattice ) quantization , so that the quantization error is a stochastic process , independent of the input signal , and the whole system becomes linear .",
    "this linearization is highly desirable , since it allows an exact system analysis for any filter order and at any resolution .",
    "the case of infinite filter order has a very simple solution in the frequency domain , which ( for large lattice dimension ) guarantees that the proposed scheme achieves the symmetric two - channel md rate - distortion function  @xcite .    besides the quantizer - based md schemes mentioned above there exist several other approaches , e.g.  md schemes based on quantized overcomplete expansions  @xcite .",
    "the works of  @xcite are based on finite frame expansions and that of  @xcite are based on redundant @xmath4-channel filter banks .",
    "it is well known that there is a connection between quantized overcomplete expansions and delta - sigma quantization , cf .",
    "@xcite . furthermore ,",
    "as mentioned above , the connection between overcomplete expansions and the md problem has also been established . yet , to the best of the authors knowledge , none of the schemes presented in  @xcite are able to achieve the above mentioned md rate - distortion bounds .",
    "furthermore , the use of delta - sigma quantization explicitly for md coding appears to be a new idea . in this paper",
    ", we show that traditional delta - sigma quantization can be recast in the context of md coding and furthermore , that it provides an optimal solution to the md problem in the symmetric case .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : deltasigma ] , we provide an introduction to dithered delta - sigma quantization . in section  [ sec : mdchr ] , a connection between delta - sigma quantization and md coding is established and we present the main theorem of this work .",
    "the proof of the theorem is deferred to section  [ sec : proofs ] .",

    "if subsequent quantizer outputs are entropy - coded jointly , then we must change the blockwise mutual information in the rate formula ( [ eq : ecdqrate ] ) to the joint mutual information between input - output sequences ( if there is no feedback ) @xcite , or to the _ directed _ mutual information ( if there is feedback ) @xcite .",
    "if the source @xmath17 is white gaussian , then the coding rate ( [ eq : ecdqrate ] ) , normalized per - sample , is upper bounded by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the dimensionless normalized second moment of the @xmath5-dimensional lattice quantizer @xmath15  @xcite . in the second equality",

    "we would like to emphasize that the dithered delta - sigma quantization scheme is not limited to oversampling ratios of two .",

    "if @xmath5 coders are operating in parallel , we can form the set of @xmath5 independent samples @xmath108 and make use of @xmath5-dimensional ecdq on the vector @xmath108 .",
    "in general , we will allow @xmath5 to become large so that , according to  ( [ eq : rateecdq ] ) and the paragraph that follows just below  ( [ eq : rateecdq ] ) , the rate loss @xmath34 due to the quantization noise being non - gaussian can be made arbitrarily small .",
    "thus , for large @xmath5 , @xmath70 in ( [ eq : ratesd1 ] ) can indeed be approximated as gaussian noise .",
    "in this section we show that the sequential dithered delta - sigma quantization system , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltasigma ] , can be regarded as an md coding system .",

    "notice that although the oversampled signal @xmath109 has memory , the source part in each description is memoryless , because we assume ideal interpolation so for a gaussian source the even / odd splitting of the samples corresponds to downsampling by two .",

    "the all - pass filter @xmath116 is needed because the upsampling operation performed at the encoder , i.e.  upsampling by two followed by ideal lowpass filtering ( sinc - interpolation ) , shifts the phase of the odd samples .",

    "in this section we concentrate on the asymptotic case where @xmath135 , i.e.  infinite noise shaping filter order and infinite vector quantizer dimension . for analysis purposes ,",
    "this allows us to assume gaussian quantization noise in the system model of fig .",
    "[ fig : deltasigma_model ] , with arbitrarily shaped equivalent noise spectrum ( [ eq : equivalent_spectrum ] ) .",
    "we first give an intuitive frequency interpretation of the proposed delta - sigma quantization scheme .",
    "this frequency interpretation reveals that the role of the noise shaping filter is not simply to shape away the quantization noise from the in - band spectrum , as is the case in traditional delta - sigma quantization , but rather to delicately control the tradeoff between the in - band noise versus the out - of - band noise , which translates into a tradeoff between the central and side distortions .",
    "this tradeoff is done while keeping the coding rate fixed , which , at least at high resolution , is equivalent to keeping the quantizer variance @xmath136 fixed .",
    "see ( [ eq : ratesdhr ] ) .",
    "recall that we , at the central decoder , apply an anti - aliasing filter ( ideal lowpass filtering ) before downsampling .",
    "hence , the central distortion is given by the energy of the quantization noise that falls within the in - band spectrum .",
    "the inclusion of a noise shaping filter at the encoder makes it possible to shape away the quantization noise from the in - band spectrum and thereby reduce the central distortion . by increasing the order of the noise shaping filter it is possible to reduce the central distortion accordingly .",
    "it is also interesting to understand what influences the side distortion .",
    "the side descriptions are constructed by using either all odd samples or all even samples of the output @xmath94 .",
    "hence , we effectively downsample @xmath94 by a factor of two .",
    "it is important to see that this downsampling process takes place without first applying an anti - aliasing filter .",
    "thus , aliasing is inevitable .",
    "it follows , that not only the noise which falls within the in - band spectrum contributes to the side distortion but also the noise that falls outside the in - band spectrum ( i.e.  the out - of - band noise ) affects the distortion .",
    "since , in traditional delta - sigma quantization , the noise is shaped away from the in - band spectrum as efficiently as possible , the out - of - band noise is likely to be the dominating contributor to the side distortion .",
    "we have illustrated this in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_e ] .",
    "it should now be clear that , in two - channel md delta - sigma quantization , the role of the noise shaping filter is to trade off the in - band noise versus the out - of - band noise . in particular , in the asymptotic case where the order of the noise shaping filter goes to infinity , it is possible to construct a brick - wall filter which has a squared magnitude spectrum of @xmath137 in the passband ( i.e.  for @xmath138 ) and of @xmath139 in the stopband ( i.e.  for @xmath140 ) . in this case , the central distortion is proportional to @xmath137 whereas the side distortion is proportional to @xmath141 .",

    "let us now fix the energy ratio @xmath329 , where @xmath330 , @xmath331 and @xmath332 . with this",
    ", it follows that @xmath333 using  ( [ eq : hpoverlp ] ) in the left - hand - side of  ( [ eq : spectralproduct ] ) leads to the following two inequalities @xmath334 and @xmath335 where we have equality in both  ( [ eq : lb_dc ] ) and  ( [ eq : lb_ds ] ) ( at the same time ) if and only if the filter is minimum phase and the power spectrum is a two - step function , i.e.  it has constant power @xmath336 through - out the lowpass band and @xmath139 through - out the highpass band . at this point",
    "we let @xmath337 and @xmath338 from which it can be shown that the distortions at general resolution are given by @xmath339 and @xmath340 inserting the lower bounds of  ( [ eq : lb_dc ] ) and  ( [ eq : lb_ds ] ) into  ( [ eq : dcpdc1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : dspds1 ] ) yields ozarow s symmetric rate - distortion function ( see  ( [ eq : centralpost ] ) and ( [ eq : sidedistpost ] ) ) . moreover ,",
    "( [ eq : dcpdc1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : dspds1 ] ) are strictly increasing in @xmath341 and @xmath342 , respectively .",
    "thus , for a fixed ratio @xmath343 , any other spectrum than the two - step @xmath321 given above must necessarily lead to a greater distortion . to complete the proof , we remark that in order to have such an ideal brick - wall power spectrum , the order of the filter must necessarily be infinite .",
