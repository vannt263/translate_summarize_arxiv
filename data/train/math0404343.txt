    "various models have been developed for the analysis of ranking data .",
    "these include thurstonian models , distance - based models , paired and higher - order comparison models , anova - type loglinear models , multistage models and unfolding models , to name only a few .",
    "these models give a description of the ranking process and/or the population of rankers . for a comprehensive treatment of the methods for analyzing and modelling ranking data ,",
    "see the excellent book by marden  @xcite .",
    "the unfolding model was devised by coombs  @xcite for the analysis of ranking data based on preferential choice behavior . according to de soete , feger and klauer  @xcite , `` historically , two of the most important contributions to psychological choice modelling are undoubtedly thurstone s  @xcite law of comparative judgment and coombs  @xcite unfolding theory . ''",
    "this model has been widely used in practice in many fields beyond psychology : sociology , marketing science , voting theory , etc .",
    "in addition , the same mathematical structure can be found in voronoi diagrams ( okabe , boots , sugihara and chiu  @xcite ) , spatial competition models in urban economics ( hotelling  @xcite , eaton and lipsey  @xcite ) and multiple discriminant analysis ( kamiya and takemura  @xcite ) .    according to the unidimensional unfolding model , preferential choice",
    "is made in the following manner : all individuals evaluate @xmath0 objects based on the objects single common attribute .",
    "each object is represented by a real number expressing the level of this attribute @xmath2 or a point on the real line @xmath3 ( the `` unidimensional underlying continuum '' ) . at the same time , each individual is also represented by a point @xmath4 on the same line .",
    "the point @xmath5 is considered the individual s favorite and is called his / her ideal point . in this model , the real line @xmath3 containing both individuals and objects is thought of as the psychological space and",
    "is called the _ joint scale _ or the j scale . here",
    "we identify individuals and objects with their corresponding points .",
    "the model assumes that individual @xmath5 ranks the @xmath0 objects @xmath6 according to their distances from @xmath7 i.e. , individual @xmath5 prefers @xmath8 to @xmath9 iff @xmath10 rankings generated by individuals in this way are sometimes called individual scales or i scales .",
    "we say that the @xmath0 points representing the objects are in general position if they and their midpoints are all distinct .",
    "further , we do not consider partial rankings or ties in this paper , so we treat only those individuals whose ideal points do not coincide with any midpoint of two objects .",
    "let @xmath11 be @xmath0 objects which satisfy these assumptions . by varying the location of the ideal point @xmath5 throughout @xmath3 except the midpoints , we can account for @xmath12 kinds of rankings of @xmath13 .",
    "the significance of using this model lies here : there are @xmath14 potential rankings , but the psychological structure restricts the variety of rankings that can actually occur .",
    "these @xmath12 rankings are called the _ admissible rankings _ of @xmath15    the unidimensional unfolding model was extended to the multidimensional case by bennett and hays  @xcite and hays and bennett  @xcite . as the dimension @xmath16 of the psychological space gets large , the number of admissible rankings accounted for by this model increases , hence more rankings can be explained .",
    "this means that the psychological structure becomes looser as @xmath16 increases .",
    "in fact , when @xmath17 all @xmath14 rankings are admissible , and the model in this case is not interesting at all . thus finding an appropriate dimension is important in the actual analysis of ranking data . in this paper , we restrict our attention to the unidimensional unfolding model .    for a given set of @xmath0 objects represented by @xmath18 we call the set of @xmath12 admissible rankings of @xmath19 the _ ranking pattern _ of @xmath20 by considering different attributes",
    ", we can get different sets of @xmath0 real numbers @xmath13 for the same @xmath0 objects , and thus obtain different ranking patterns .",
    "examination of the collected sample of ranking data can tell us what aspect of the @xmath0 objects determines the present individuals preferential choice behavior towards these @xmath0 objects , thereby enabling some inference about the latent structure .",
    "it is generally impossible to explain all ranking data by considering any single attribute .",
    "van blokland - vogelesang  @xcite introduces an error structure into the unfolding model and makes it a probabilistic model .",
    "the error structure in her model is an extension of the feigin and cohen  @xcite model .",
    "other types of error structures have also been studied by other authors ( brady  @xcite , bckenholt and gaul  @xcite , de soete , carroll and desarbo  @xcite ) . moreover , for a set of ranking data which is not completely compatible with any joint scale , van blokland - vogelesang  @xcite proposes a method for finding the `` best '' joint scale based on kendall s @xmath21 distance .",
    "the arguments so far imply that it is important to know the variety of ranking patterns generated by the unfolding model .",
    "the significance of this problem can also be understood in the context of voting theory or social choice theory .",
    "it is well known ( coombs  @xcite , luce and raiffa  @xcite ) that the unfolding model avoids voting cycles by restricting the possible rankings .",
    "suppose three individuals @xmath22 and @xmath23 rank three objects labelled @xmath24 and @xmath25 as @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively , where objects @xmath24 and @xmath25 are listed in order from best to worst in the expression @xmath28 here two individuals @xmath29 and @xmath23 prefer @xmath30 to @xmath31 while @xmath32 prefers @xmath33 to @xmath34 so by simple majority rule , @xmath30 is preferred to @xmath33 as a collective preference .",
    "in the same way , the simple majority rule yields the collective preference that @xmath33 is preferred to @xmath25 and that @xmath25 is preferred to @xmath34 entailing intransitivity called a voting cycle .",
    "but if the individuals preferences are limited to those determined by the unfolding model , we can see that the collective preference by simple majority rule coincides with the median individual s preference and thus in particular produces no voting cycles . here",
    "the median individual means the individual @xmath35 whose ideal point @xmath36 is the median of the individuals ideal points @xmath37 the same holds true for any odd number of individuals and any number @xmath38 of objects .",
    "thus it is crucial to clarify how much restriction the unfolding model imposes on individuals possible preferences .",
    "we show next that it suffices to study the case where the @xmath0 objects @xmath11 are ordered as @xmath39 consider two sets of @xmath0 objects @xmath40 and @xmath41 if the rank orders of their midpoints from left to right on @xmath3 are the same or the reverse of each other , then @xmath19 and @xmath42 produce the same ranking pattern .",
    "conversely , if @xmath19 and @xmath42 induce the same ranking pattern , their midpoint orders are the same or the reverse of each other .",
    "these facts can be confirmed by using results of kamiya and takemura  @xcite .",
    "here we agree to say that two rank orders of midpoints ( or objects ) are essentially different if one is different from the other as well as from the reverse of the other .",
    "these arguments imply that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the set of ranking patterns and the set of essentially different rank orders of midpoints of the objects .",
    "since the rank order of objects is completely determined by the rank order of their midpoints , two sets of @xmath0 objects having essentially different rank orders give rise to essentially different rank orders of their midpoints and thus different ranking patterns .    on the other hand , it is obvious that for any permutation @xmath43 of @xmath44 the set of ranking patterns generated by all @xmath40 satisfying @xmath45 can be obtained from the set of ranking patterns generated by all @xmath40 with @xmath46 just by relabelling the objects ( lemma [ sigmax ] in section 2 ) .",
    "these considerations tell us that it suffices to consider the case @xmath47    midpoint order depends on the distances between objects .",
    "the joint scale discussed so far is sometimes called the quantitative joint scale .",
    "another type of joint scale is sometimes considered where we disregard the metric information of the quantitative joint scale and take into account only the order of its objects . in this case",
    "we obtain the so - called qualitative joint scale .",
    "the set of admissible rankings of the qualitative joint scale having objects @xmath11 with @xmath48 is , by definition , the union of the sets of admissible rankings of the quantitative joint scales whose objects are given by changing only the distances among @xmath11 while keeping their rank order @xmath49 obviously , the number of qualitative joint scales is @xmath50 and the number of admissible rankings of each qualitative joint scale is @xmath51 ( davison  @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we consider quantitative joint scales exclusively , hence a joint scale always means a quantitative joint scale .",
    "suppose the objects @xmath11 are ordered as @xmath52 we want to know the number of possible rank orders of the midpoints @xmath53 any possible rank order of the midpoints @xmath54 must satisfy the condition that the rank @xmath55 of @xmath56 from left to right on @xmath3 be increasing in @xmath57 for any fixed @xmath58 as well as increasing in @xmath58 for any fixed @xmath59 consider the number @xmath60 of functions @xmath61 satisfying this condition . clearly @xmath60 serves as an upper bound for the number of possible rank orders of the midpoints @xmath62 thrall  @xcite obtained this number by considering a problem similar to that of counting the number of standard young tableaux .",
    "however , @xmath60 is only an upper bound , since the rank order of the midpoints meeting the above - mentioned condition does not necessarily satisfy other restrictions induced by the rank order of the objects .",
    "van blokland - vogelesang  @xcite finds two kinds of such `` intransitive '' midpoint orders by way of `` comparing intervals '' and `` merging intervals . ''    in this paper , we find the number of possible rank orders of midpoints and thereby obtain the number of ranking patterns generated by the unidimensional unfolding model .",
    "this is achieved by introducing a new type of arrangement called the mid - hyperplane arrangement .",
    "for the general theory of hyperplane arrangements , see orlik and terao  @xcite .",
    "although we give a formula for the number of ranking patterns for all @xmath0 in theorem [ 1.6 ] , we calculate this number only for @xmath63 due to computational complexity .",
    "in addition to determining the number of ranking patterns , we may ask a further question of interest .",
    "suppose the @xmath0 objects are randomly determined .",
    "what is the probability that a given ranking pattern occurs ?",
    "as will be seen in section 6 , this problem for @xmath64 reduces to that of finding volumes of some spherical tetrahedra .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2 , we define the mid - hyperplane arrangement and show that the number of ranking patterns can be obtained by counting the number of chambers of this arrangement . in section 3 , we reduce the problem to that of counting the number of points in certain finite sets . based on these results , we actually obtain the number of ranking patterns for @xmath65 in section 4 and for @xmath66 in section 5 .",
    "we also show in those sections that the characteristic polynomial of the mid - hyperplane arrangement is a product of linear factors in @xmath67 $ ] if and only if @xmath68 in section 6 , we consider the problem of the probabilities of ranking patterns and give the answer for @xmath69 objects . in section 7 , we mention some open problems .",

    "for @xmath354 there are @xmath355 possible ranking patterns in all . by relabelling the indices it suffices to consider the case @xmath356 furthermore , by replacing @xmath357 by @xmath358",
    ", it suffices to consider the case @xmath359    under restriction ( [ restriction2 ] ) , we have @xmath360 possible ranking patterns , which are characterized by the following midpoint orders ( lemma [ 1.5 ] , theorem [ 1.3 ] ) : @xmath361    we are interested in the conditional probabilities of the six midpoint orders above assuming ( [ restriction2 ] ) .",
    "recall that these midpoint orders represent chambers of @xmath362 ( lemma [ 1.5 ] ) .",
    "we argue next that our problem reduces to computing the spherical volumes of the restrictions of some chambers of @xmath362 to the three - dimensional unit sphere .",
    "we begin by recalling that all hyperplanes in @xmath362 contain the line @xmath363 where @xmath364 is the vector of 1 s .",
    "the orthogonal projection of @xmath365 onto @xmath366 will be denoted by @xmath367 where @xmath368 since @xmath19 is assumed to be distributed as a spherical distribution , the marginal distribution of the orthogonal projection @xmath369 is a spherical distribution of one less dimension ( muirhead  @xcite ) .",
    "now , any @xmath370 and its orthogonal projection @xmath369 are on the same side of each hyperplane in @xmath371 so for any chamber @xmath372 we have @xmath373 with @xmath374 this @xmath375 can be regarded as a chamber of the arrangement @xmath376 in @xmath377    each hyperplane in @xmath378 contains the origin .",

    "the binding inequalities of the spherical chambers associated with the six midpoint orders are @xmath393 with the exception of ( ii ) , the closures of these chambers are spherical tetrahedra @xmath394 where @xmath395 chamber ( ii ) is a quadrilateral pyramid @xmath396 which can be divided into two tetrahedra , say , @xmath397 and @xmath398 note that this observation implies that the closures of the chambers of the mid - hyperplane arrangement @xmath399 are not necessarily simplices .",

    "unlike the unidimensional case , the problem does not reduce to counting chambers of a hyperplane arrangement and the problem seems to be quite difficult at this stage .",
