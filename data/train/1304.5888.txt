    "optical diffraction forms a fundamental limitation to the creation and detection of small images for conventional optical devices and microscopy .",
    "the reason is that any image with finite size can be considered as a group of different plane - wave components .",
    "each component acquires a different phase shift during propagation either in free space or in medium .",
    "the resulting superposition of all wave components leads to diffraction , which means that the transmitted image will be distorted even after propagating only a few rayleigh lengths  @xcite . from this interpretation",
    "it is clear that diffraction can be eliminated if conditions are tailored such that each plane - wave component acquires the same phase shift during propagation . to achieve this ,",
    "it has for example been suggested that several specially - shaped beams with spatially - dependent phases such as airy  @xcite , bessel  @xcite , and mathieu beams  @xcite , can propagate without diffraction in free space , since the phase differences between the different components are exactly compensated by the initially spatially dependent phases .",
    "it has also been recognized that optical diffraction can be greatly suppressed or even eliminated by using atomic coherence effects such as electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite , coherent population trapping ( cpt )  @xcite , or saturated absorption techniques  @xcite in multilevel atomic systems .",
    "most of these methods can be understood by noting that the spatially - dependent probe and coherent control fields couple to the atomic transition in such a way , that the probe field experiences a spatially dependent refractive index depending on the intensity of the control fields . as an example",
    ", a suitable spatially dependent control field can optically induce a waveguide - like structure .",
    "when the probe field propagates in the induced waveguide inside the atomic medium , it is mostly confined in the waveguide due to total reflection , resulting in the elimination of the diffraction for the probe .",
    "a more interesting and counterintuitive approach , which is fundamentally different from previous methods , has been developed by firstenberg _",
    "they have theoretically proposed and experimentally verified that atomic motion and collisions can be utilized to eliminate the paraxial diffraction of arbitrary image .",
    "the underlying physics is that the phase difference acquired during propagation for each plane - wave component of the image is exactly compensated by an additional phase shift induced by the atomic motion , thus leading to the elimination of diffraction .",
    "however , this method is plagued by strong absorption .",
    "recently , li _ et al . _",
    "@xcite experimentally demonstrated that the spatial shape of a control beam can be cast onto a weak probe beam via coherent population trapping in a three - level lambda atomic system . in their experiment ,",
    "the transmitted intensity of the probe beam had a similar spatial profile as that of the control beam , no matter what the input probe is . moreover , the size of the transmitted probe beam was half of that of the diffraction - limited input probe .",
    "manipulation of the susceptibility along the transverse direction is the key idea behind mapping the spatial shape of the control beam onto the probe beam .",
    "it has been used for focusing , defocusing , and self - imaging @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the probe field is typically treated as a weak field and the control field as a strong field , such that perturbation theory can be employed to derive the linear effect of the atomic medium on the probe field propagation .",
    "there have been theoretical and experimental studies where the probe is not necessarily weak @xcite . in this situation ,",
    "the effect of the atomic coherence on the propagation dynamics of the control field need to be taken into account @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we theoretically investigate the possibility of cloning of an arbitrary image carried on an control field to another probe beam .",
    "the two control and probe beams are coupled to a three - level atomic lambda system to form a cpt configuration .",
    "we assume the two laser fields to be of comparable strength , such that perturbation theory for the probe field is not valid any more to describe the effect of the atomic medium on the two fields .",
    "we start by calculating the susceptibilities including linear and nonlinear effects for both fields by solving the related density - matrix equations . as expected , we find that a spatially - dependent refractive index for the probe field is generated , structured by the spatial intensity profile of the control beam",
    ". in particular , the generated structures enable one to transfer the transverse distribution of the control field onto the transmission profile of the probe field . in order to study the full propagation dynamics",
    ", we then numerically solve the paraxial propagation equations for both fields by using a higher order split operator method  @xcite .",
    "we begin our analysis with a gaussian control and a super - gaussian probe field and observe the gradual mapping of the control field onto the probe field throughout the propagation .",
    "we in particular find that in the case of a strong probe field , the transmitted probe beam is focused more tightly by a factor of two compared to the weak probe field case .",
    "next , we consider a control field with a spatial two - peaked hermite - gaussian profile , and demonstrated cloning of the profile onto the probe beam with feature size reduced by a factor of about 2.5 . in order to verify that our method can serve as an universal tool for cloning of arbitrary image",
    ", we finally simulate the three - dimensional light propagations for both fields , in which the spatial profile of the control field carries the three letters  cpt \" .",
    "we show that also this structure can be cloned onto the probe beam which initially has a simple plane - wave profile , even though the control field is severely distorted throughout the propagation due to diffraction .",
    "again , we observe a reduction of the feature size by a factor of about 2 in the probe field .",

    "later , we will show that this in turn leads to a smaller feature size of the image cloning scheme .",
    "the transparency of the medium to the probe field can be understood as arising from coherent population trapping ( cpt ) or electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) , depending on the relative strength of the two applied fields . in both cases",

    "therefore , at red detuning , the transverse profile of the control field allows one to imprint a fiber - like refractive index gradient onto the atomic medium .",
    "this parabolic refractive index variation causes focusing of the probe field towards the center of the control field and also guides the probe field propagation along the propagation axis .",
