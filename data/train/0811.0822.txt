    "it is important to note that some of the earlier results obtained for velocity spectra studies using velocity centroids , are likely to be in error for high mach number turbulence in molecular clouds in view of the recent insight into the properties of velocity centroids ( see esquivel & lazarian 2005 , esquivel et al .",

    "however , the dissipation scales can be estimated approximately from the velocity spectra . in the case of our models",
    "we estimated the dissipation scale @xmath34 at 30 for high resolution .",
    "we present 3d numerical experiments of compressible ( mhd ) turbulence for a range of mach numbers .",
    "we understand the mach number to be defined as the mean value of the ratio of the absolute value of the local velocity @xmath35 to the local value of the characteristic speed @xmath21 or @xmath5 ( for the sonic and alfvnic mach number , respectively).we divided our models into two groups corresponding to sub - alfvnic ( @xmath36 ) and super - alfvnic ( @xmath37 ) turbulence .",

    "we show in figure  [ fig : saturation ] the full development of global quantities magnetic , kinetic , and total energy .",
    "this figure shows that 1 dynamical time unit ( time normalized by the crossing time ) is sufficient for saturation of energies . since the saturation level is similar for all models and we solve the isothermal mhd equations , the sonic mach number is fully determined by the value of isothermal sound speed , which is our control parameter .",
    "the different initial conditions led to three values of sonic mach number , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , and two alfvnic mach numbers , @xmath43 and @xmath41 .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     finally , we present a table of select log - log correlation coefficients with error bars in tables  [ tab : coefficients1 ] and  [ tab : coefficients2 ] to see quantitatively the degree of correlation in our plots . ultimately , we seek to set an order on which models show the highest correlations .",
    "these correlation coefficients tell us the degree of the polynomial equation fitted to quantities plotted . in order to obtain these coefficients",
    "we computed the linear least - squared fit of the correlations , with error bars determined from the 1-sigma uncertainty estimates . for magnetic energy vs. density ,",
    "highly supersonic cases show positive correlations while subsonic present anti - correlation . however , it is of interest to note that the cases with the largest correlation differ in sonic mach number , but both have @xmath9=2.0 .",
    "we see that from our results that both the @xmath7 and @xmath9 play a roll in the correlation of b and @xmath17 , due to shocks creating density clumps in supersonic cases .",
    "the @xmath9=2.0 , @xmath9=0.7 case shows the closest to alfvnic perturbations ( @xmath44 ) . in general ,",
    "magnetic energy can not be correlated with @xmath17 with a simple polynomial expression . for kinetic energy vs. density , all show negative correlations with supersonic cases being correlated the greatest , showing that no strong correlation trend was obtained . for magnetic field",
    "parallel to los vs. x column density ( @xmath45 ) , the table shows that the most important factors in obtaining a strong correlation is the sonic mach number and the strength of the field .",
    "supersonic cases with large magnetic field are generally linear while supersonic cases with small magnetic field show an @xmath46 trend .",
    "looking at magnetic field perpendicular to los , it is apparent all models are near linear .",
    "the orientation of the field perpendicular to the los creates correlations that are more nearly linear and this is evident in both the plots and the coefficients of @xmath47 vs. @xmath48 .",
    "we also show the correlation coefficients for @xmath49 vs. @xmath17 .",
    "no polynomial relationship is seen for any model . for velocity dispersion and @xmath48 ,",
    "a strong linear relationship is established which is not seen for the models that are along @xmath50 ( parallel to the magnetic field ) .",
    "it is evident that the orientation of the field with respect to the los is very important in obtaining a strong correlation with dispersion .",
    "as turbulent vortexes evolve , they transfer energy from large to small scales . in this case ,",
    "wave - wave interactions generate a hierarchical turbulent cascade as @xmath51 . for incompressible flows , under kolmogorov s assumptions",
    ", we have @xmath52 and @xmath53 . for compressible and magnetized flows ,",
    "this becomes more complicated and nonlinear wave - wave interactions may take place , mainly for @xmath54 .",
    "also , we expect mhd turbulence to present more wave modes than purely hydrodynamical flows and , in this case , the energy cascade can be much more complicated . in order to study this phenomenon and characterize both amplitude and phase in the turbulent cascade , the analysis of the three - point correlation function , or bispectrum , is required ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the bispectrum technique characterizes and searches for nonlinear interactions , which makes it a timely study for interstellar mhd turbulence .",
    "however , unlike the standard power spectrum , the bispectrum is a complex function and carries phase information . in order to compute either the power spectrum or bispectrum , one must first compute the fourier transform of the signal . in the case of either a discrete or continuous fourier",
    "transform we are left with information that includes both the magnitude and the _ phase _ of the signal at a given frequency .",
    "the power spectrum measures solely the magnitude as a function of the frequency and discards the phase information .",
    "the power spectrum gives information about power distributions over all frequencies and looses information about wave - wave interactions and phase .",
    "signals containing multiple frequencies and phases are better described by the bispectrum .",
    "the bispectrum is closely related to the power spectrum .",
    "the fourier transform of the second - order cumulant , i.e. the autocorrelation function , is the power spectrum while the fourier transform of the third order cumulant is known as the bispectrum . in a discrete system , the power spectrum is defined as :    @xmath55    in a similar way , the bispectrum can be defined as :    @xmath56    where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the wave numbers of two interacting waves , and @xmath59 is the original discrete time series data with finite number of elements with @xmath60 representing the complex conjugate of @xmath59 . as is shown in equation  [ eq : bispectra ] ,",
    "the bispectrum is a complex quantity which will measure both phase and magnitude information between different wave modes .    in practice ,",
    "our calculation of the bispectrum involves performing a fast fourier transform of density or column density and the application of equation  [ eq : bispectra ] .",
    "although we are primarily interested here in density fluctuations , the bispectrum can also be calculated for other fields as well .",
    "we randomly choose wavevectors and their directions , @xmath57 and @xmath58 and iterate over them , calculating @xmath61 , which depends on @xmath57 and @xmath58 since @xmath62 .",
    "we limit the maximum length of the wave vectors to half of the box size .",
    "we normalize direction vectors to unity , calculate positions in fourier space , and finally , compute the bispectrum , which yields a complex number .",
    "we then average this bispectrum over all frequencies and plot bispectral amplitudes .",
    "this gives us information on the degree of mode correlation in the system .    in this section",
    "we will explore the bispectrum of density and column density for the data cubes . because this is the first application of the bispectrum to ism related studies and we would like to have a comparison with observations , exploring fields other then density and column density is beyond the scope of this paper . although the application of the bispectrum to velocity and magnetic fields would be interesting and provide a beneficial follow up to densities , we focus here only on density and column density maps in order to make our study comparable with observational column densities .",
    "bispectral analysis can be applied to observational data in a similar way as the synthetic data presented in this paper utilizing equation  [ eq : bispectra ] .",
    "our model does not include self - gravity or external gravity , and only considers the interplay between the gas pressure and magnetic pressure of isothermal gas . by examining the bispectrum of density and comparing it with column densities",
    ", we can characterize turbulent flows on resolutions that are realistically seen in observational data .",
    "we will look at different models of turbulence including a gaussian , pure hydro , and different mhd regimes .",
    "we will examine differences between the bispectrum of density and column density and discuss what information about the sonic mach number and magnetic field that might be gained by applying the bispectrum to observable data .",
    "we ran the bispectrum analysis for the last snapshots of the density and column density cubes on x and y - directions for all mhd models .",
    "we also performed the bispectrum calculation for two comparison models : a supersonic hydrodynamical simulation and a random synthetic gaussian distribution of density .",
    "the density and column density integrated along x and y bispectra are shown in figure  [ fig : bispectra ] , on the left , center and right columns , respectively . in the the first row we present the results obtained for the gaussian distribution , followed by the hydrodynamical case and then the mhd models .",
    "the models are labeled for the different turbulent regimes with varying values of @xmath9 and @xmath7 .",
    "we plotted contours and their corresponding color amplitudes in order to see both differences in the shape and magnitude of the bispectrum .                        upon examination of figure  [ fig : bispectra ]",
    "one sees a general correspondence between the bispectrum of the column density and the underlying 3d bispectrum .",
    "all cases show a prominent amplitude of the bispectrum and thus a high correlation of modes , at @xmath63 .",
    "this is to be expected since this is a trivial case where wave numbers will always show correlation .",
    "however , the amplitudes at @xmath54 are different for each turbulent regime .",
    "the more circularly shaped the isocontours and stronger the amplitudes are , the more highly correlated the modes are .",
    "the gaussian distribution shows almost no correlation ( very weak amplitudes ) for @xmath54 and the distribution is mostly localized in the diagonal line ( i.e. where @xmath63 ) .",
    "this is because the distribution of density is entirely random and thus modes should lack association .",
    "the supersonic hydro model is similar to a super - alfvnic supersonic mhd model , as expected , and is more strongly correlated then the gaussian density distribution .",
    "the mhd models also present broader distributions over the @xmath64 plane , thus showing high correlation .",
    "the bispectrum of mhd density is shown in the first column starting at the third map down .",
    "larger wave numbers ( representing larger frequencies and smaller wavelengths ) are less correlated in all models , since higher wave numbers are present near the end of the energy cascade when more of the systems energy has dissipated . for the models with the same @xmath9 but",
    "varying @xmath65 , we found an increase in the wave - wave coupling under the supersonic regime .",
    "this phenomenon is expected , as interactions between different modes generate small scale shocks .",
    "shocks in supersonic models greatly increase wave - wave correlations over subsonic models , which are incompressible .",
    "the supersonic models of density ( 1st column , last and second to last rows ) show such strong correlations that the strength of the @xmath54 is comparable to the @xmath63 line .",
    "interestingly , comparing models with same sonic mach number , the sub - alfvnic cases show increased wave - wave coupling for @xmath54 . here",
    ", non - linear coupling is increased by the magnetic field . comparing density models with @xmath66 we see that a stronger magnetic field shows slightly higher amplitudes and has a more circular isocontour profile . comparing @xmath67 models , it is easy to see that stronger amplitudes exist for the cases with @xmath68 .",
    "looking specifically at the second and third columns for the supersonic models , the amplitudes of the @xmath68 models are much stronger then that of the @xmath69 models .",
    "it is clear from these models that a stronger magnetic field causes enhanced correlation of modes . for super - alfvnic models , the large scale ( low k ) magnetic field configuration is destroyed and the mhd modes operate at smaller scales .",
    "both effects reveal that the energy cascade , generated or amplified by @xmath54 interactions , may work differently on the turbulent regimes , and kolmogorov scalings may not well - characterize them .    regarding observable parameters",
    ", the column density bispectra do not show such prominent differences compared to the density analysis .",
    "however , the column density bispectra present larger noise because of worse statistics ( 512@xmath70 maps compared to the @xmath0 density cube ) .",
    "however , the supersonic and sub - alfvnic model shows a notably different distribution , with larger amplitudes for @xmath54 , similarly to the density bispectrum .",
    "smaller amplification is seen in the subsonic cases , particularly the subsonic super - alfvnic model .",
    "it is clear from the bispectra of density and column density that supersonic models present the highest correlation of modes while models with a high magnetic field also enhances mode correlation .",
    "if this is true for synthetic data then the bispectrum technique could be used to characterize magnetized turbulence in the ism .",
    "interestingly , the broadening of bispectrum distribution by the magnetic field is mostly independent on the orientation of the magnetic field lines regarding the line of sight , however differences are clear for supersonic sub - alfvnic cases .",
    "the bispectrum is slightly broader for the x direction since the mean magnetic field is along this axis .",
    "the column density bispectra present larger noise because of worse statistics ( 512@xmath70 maps compared to the @xmath0 density cube ) . from our studies",
    "it is obvious that the bispectrum requires very high resolution data in order to yield meaningful results .",
    "noise and other outside influences can completely mask a desired signal information in the bispectrum .",
    "noise will produce a false bispectral map , showing higher correlations for larger wavenumbers .",
    "therefore , bispectral analysis of observational maps can be used to reveal the turbulent regimes operating in molecular clouds , but only if high resolution maps with minimal noise are available .",
    "quantitative studies of compressible mhd turbulence in cho & lazarian ( 2002 , 2003 ) , concentrated on decomposition of turbulence perturbations into slow , fast and alfvnic modes and studies of their spectra .",
    "such a decomposition requires the knowledge of the local magnetic field , which is not the case for the data averaged along the line of sight .",
    "therefore from observations the total spectra of turbulent perturbations are available .",
    "the density spectrum is readily available from column density measurements , while the velocity spectrum requires more sophisticated techniques , like velocity channel analysis ( vca ) or velocity coordinate spectrum ( vcs ) to be used ( see lazarian & pogosyan 2000 , 2006 , 2008 ) .",
    "different numerical studies show that for mhd turbulence , the velocity spectrum gets steeper for velocity and shallow for density @xmath17 as the @xmath11 increases stays invariant to @xmath11 both in hydro ( kritsuk et al .",
    "2006 ) and mhd ( kowal & lazarian 2006 ) turbulence . ] .",
    "klb showed that the dependences of the density spectrum on @xmath12 is less prominent than on @xmath11 .",
    "above we studied the bispectrum of density and noticed the dependence of the measure of @xmath11 . we see that the variations of the bispectrum with @xmath12 for all @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and find that the phases of the turbulent fluctuations are more correlated in the presence of the dynamically important magnetic fields .",
    "klb presented an extensive statistical analysis of mhd density for cubes of resolution @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "however , they only examined the skewness and kurtosis for the lower resolution model ( @xmath71 ) . in this work",
    "we study cubes of @xmath73 resolution in order to compare with the statistics of lower resolution models .",
    "klb examined a larger range of @xmath7 values and noticed that the asymmetry grows with @xmath7 , but only if @xmath74 . in this work , we study models with @xmath75 and we find that statistical moments such as skewness and kurtosis are easy to obtain and are very useful for characterizing sonic mach number in a magnetized turbulent system .",
    "we confirm the results of klb in finding that the moments all have strong dependence on the sonic mach number . as turbulence becomes increasingly supersonic , the skewness of density and column density increases , which is agreement with klb .",
    "we also see a very rapid growth in kurtosis of density and column density with sonic mach number .",
    "both column density and density show increasing asymmetric distributions with increasing @xmath7 .",
    "if one observes a given skew and kurtosis of column density , the value of @xmath7 can be inferred and related to density , which could be very useful when applied to observational data .",
    "it seems that in both our study and in klb , @xmath9 does not affect the moments of density .",
    "our study of magnetic fields and column density correlations in isothermal nonlinear mhd waves has similarities to that of passot & vzquez - semadeni(2003 ) who found that the relation of magnetic field strength b on density @xmath17 depends on whether the mhd wave is a slow or fast mode .",
    "their results confirmed that , except for cases of insufficient field fluctuations , the magnetic pressure behaves as : @xmath76 for slow modes ( low @xmath9 ) and @xmath77 for fast modes .",
    "however , while this study incorporated a large variety of values for the alfvn mach number ( @xmath78 , they lacked sampling of sonic mach numbers , only focusing their analysis on supersonic values , @xmath79 .",
    "they also only investigated 2d models , while in this study we use 3d simulations of magnetic energy and density as well as 2d correlations of magnetic field and column density at higher resolutions . in this study",
    "we also explore subsonic as well as supersonic cases and find that the sonic mach number is a critical parameter in determining how b and @xmath17 correlate , since it determines whether or not density clumps will develop . in agreement with passot & vzquez - semadeni(2003 ) , we also find that a larger value of @xmath9 yields a tighter correlation between density and magnetic pressure , especially at higher density .",
    "this effect can easily be seen by comparing the 3d correlations in figure  [ fig : dens_emag ] , the @xmath66 cases .",
    "however , figures  [ fig : cden_bpar_x]-[fig : cden_bper_z ] confirm a more linear relationship for slow modes ( i.e. low @xmath9 ) over larger @xmath9 , which contain both slow and fast modes .",
    "we also see that the orientation of the field along the los can effect these results and we confirm passot & vzquez - semadeni s result that the angle between the magnetic field and the wave propagation will play a role in determining the importance of the modes .",
    "subsonic models generally show little correlations , yet in the 2d correlations we show that when the los is perpendicular to the magnetic field and mean field ( figure  [ fig : cden_bper_z ] ) , subsonic correlations begin to show a degree of linearity .    while higher order moments show virtually no dependence on @xmath9 , correlations , on the other hand , can yield information regarding the dynamical importance of the magnetic field in the evolution of densities . according to padoan and norlund(1999 ) , cloud dynamics only become strongly affected by magnetic field in very dense regions and on small scales .",
    "it was also further stated in padoan et al.(2004 ) that , while the volume averaged magnetic field strength in a molecular cloud has never directly been measured , there is evidence from the power spectrum of gas densities that super - alfvnic turbulence is dominate in these star forming regions . from the 3d correlation in figure",
    "[ fig : dens_emag ] it is clear that magnetic fields play an important role in shaping density .",
    "this is especially true of supersonic models where a correlation of magnetic energy and density exists .",
    "higher density regions are good candidates for star formation , thus it may seem promising that higher magnetic field strength could indicate more star forming regions . also , from figure  [ fig : dens_malf ] it is clear that even though turbulence may be globally super or sub - alfvnic , dense _ clumps _ influence magnetic field to a point where the local alfvn mach number can change greatly . in the case of super - alfvnic turbulence , high density results in smaller values @xmath9 ( although they generally remain super - alfvnic ) while in sub - alfvnic turbulence , @xmath9 steadily increases with density to the point where turbulence becomes super - alfvnic .",
    "however , even though clumps in globally sub - alfvnic clouds are able to become locally super - alfvnic , this does not mean that the cloud as a whole becomes super - alfvnic .",
    "we do not see any evidence that the cloud as a whole is unaffected by a strong magnetic field , although we do see that indeed a magentic field has a strong impact on small scale turbulence .",
    "therefore , our globally super - alfvnic models support padoan and norlund(1999 ) s claim that magnetic field plays a leading role in the dynamics of very dense clumpy regions ( i.e. as density increases , @xmath80 ) , however there is no evidence for this in our sub - alfvnic models , which show that on small scales density clumps are increasingly super - alfvnic , and thus have a lower b field .",
    "overall , these correlations only give us information on how the magnetic field effects local density clumps and not whole cloud .",
    "however , it is perhaps promising that our results tend to be locally super - alfvnic for high densities , despite the global magnetic field .",
    "more studies will be needed in order to confirm padoan and norlund(1999 ) results .    while density statistics are improtant to understanding turbulent processes ,",
    "the observational velocity information provided by radio spectroscopic data should be utilized in order to gain a broader study of turbulent interactions .",
    "the difficulty in directly comparing synthetic velocity dispersions with observational spectral velocities lies in the fact that the emissivity of a spectral line has dependence on velocity and density . in order to better understand this ,",
    "we calculate correlations of velocity dispersion vs. column density and also investigate how dispersion of velocity correlates with the measures available through doppler shifted spectral lines .",
    "lazarian et al.(2001 ) studied emissivity statistics and the density - velocity correlation to better understand how density and velocity interact in a turbulent media . in this study",
    ", we confirm that a moderate correlation between column density and velocity exists , specifically seeing that higher velocities indicate higher compression of matter .",
    "however , we further find here that these correlations gain strength when the los is @xmath81 to the magnetic field .",
    "the lazarian et al .",
    "study used lower resolution cubes and only examined 3d cases , while here we investigate 2d cases at higher resolutions .",
    "in general , further studies must be made in order to understand how best to relate observational velocity line profiles to simulated velocity dispersions .      in order to compare correlations of 3d densities to quantities more similar to what",
    "is avaliable through observations ( i.e. column density , velocity dispersions ) , we provide 2d column density correlations .",
    "we do indeed see several similarities between 3d correlation maps and their 2d counterparts .",
    "for instance , when comparing the correlation of density and magnetic energy ( figure  [ fig : dens_emag ] ) with correlations of magnetic field and column density ( figures  [ fig : cden_bpar_x]-[fig : cden_bper_z ] ) , we see that for supersonic cases , magnetic energy ( @xmath82 ) and magnetic field both increase with density and column density .",
    "this implies that for 2d and 3d cases , magnetic fields become trapped in high density clumps .",
    "however , because figure  [ fig : dens_emag ] is a volume plot and we plot magnetic energy instead of field , we see differences .",
    "most notably , we see a @xmath83 for 2d maps and @xmath82 increases more exponentially with @xmath17 for supersonic cases .",
    "we can see this trend from table  [ tab : coefficients2 ] , with 2d correlations being linear with cases with the field perpendicular to the los being the most linear .",
    "therefore , although the magnetic field and energy both see a similar growth with density for supersonic turbulence , the rate of growth is different .",
    "subsonic cases for both 3d and 2d correlations both showed the least correlation .",
    "specific kinetic energy ( @xmath84 ) vs. density showed no special relationship .",
    "however , the kinetic energy weighted by density ( @xmath85 ) shows a nearly linear correlation for supersonic cases .",
    "we see a similar behavior for velocity dispersions vs. column density .",
    "these dispersions are also weighted by density , since observers must also account for the column density when a measure of velocity dispersion is made . because of density clumps , both 2d and 3d quantities increase with dispersion and kinetic energy , respectively . for both correlations , subsonic models",
    "show less linear correlations . however , despite many similarities , it is not necessarily straightforward to compare the two , since the velocity dispersion seems to be effected by the orientation of the magnetic field with the los .",
    "we have not tested this effect on kinetic energy density .",
    "it is obvious from the 2d correlations that the field orientation effects how correlated dispersions are with column density . when the field is perpendicular to the los , the most linear correlations are obtained , as is evident from table  [ tab : coefficients2 ] .",
    "dense clumps can drag the field lines and , therefore , present a more isotropic velocity field .",
    "this effect results in an increase in the dispersion of the velocity measured along the los",
    ".      the bispectrum can give us valuable information regarding how the modes of a nonlinear system correlate .",
    "the power spectrum has been used in numerous papers to analyze observations , ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in section  [ sec : bispectrum ]",
    "we analyzed the bispectrum for densities and column densities and we have found several interesting features which may provide new ways of analyzing data .",
    "different turbulent parameters display very different bispectra , and thus the bispectrum maybe be used to characterize mach number and magnetic field in observational data .",
    "for instance , the bispectrum of density and column density gives information as to how shocks and magnetic fields affect turbulence .",
    "it has been shown by klb and beresnyak et al.(2005 ) that in supersonic turbulence , shocks produce compressed density and a shallower spectrum . looking at figure  [ fig : bispectra ] for density ( first column ) it is clear that these shocks play a crucial role in the correlation of modes .",
    "the subsonic cases show little correlation between any points except the case of @xmath6 .",
    "the compressed densities from supersonic turbulence are critical for correlations between wavenumbers , since waves will be compressed together and therefore have more interactions .",
    "also interesting to consider is the differences in sub - alfvnic and super - alfvnic cases for density .",
    "we find excellent agreement with klb in that density structures are well correlated to the presence of magnetic fields . for super - alfvnic cases ,",
    "it is clear from figure  [ fig : bispectra ] that the system lacks the stronger correlations that are a characteristic of the sub - alfvnic models .",
    "for super - alfvnic simulations , correlations in frequency are not as readily made due to large dispersion of density structure .",
    "the bispectrum of supersonic hydro models is similar to the super - alfvnic , supersonic cases .",
    "it is clear from these cases that the presence of a magnetic field assists in the correlation of modes .    in order to relate to observations ,",
    "the bispectrum of column densities is provided in order to compare with density .",
    "it should be noted that while our model does not include self or external gravity , it has been shown by @xcite that self - gravity partitions the gas into clouds which contributes to scale - free motions generated by turbulence .",
    "thus , self - gravity enhances small scale structure and our results should be relatively unaffected , as we are primarily concerned with large scale turbulent cascades . for both density and column density ,",
    "strongest correlations are found in the case of supersonic sub - alfvnic turbulence .",
    "differences in image quality between density and column density maps arise from the fact that density cubes have higher resolution ( @xmath86 vs. @xmath87 ) . because the magnetic field enhances correlations ,",
    "the bispectrum could be used to characterize the magnetic field in studies similar to goodman et al.(1995 ) ; padoan & nordlund ( 1999 ) .",
    "the bispectrum has proved to be an important addition to the tools of statistical studies of mhd turbulence .",
    "this new tool could be used to characterize the mach number of gas in the interstellar medium as well as the magnetic field .",
    "however , it should be noted that very high quality data is required since the multipoint statistics are known to increase noise . for the interstellar medium",
    "it has been suggested in @xcite to compare various regions of the sky using the bispectrum to search for like signals .",
    "these studies are to be done elsewhere .",
    "in this paper we investigated several different statistics of density structure of compressible mhd turbulence .",
    "we examined the skewness and kurtosis of the data as well as studied several different measures of correlations .",
    "in particular , we examined the bispectrum of compressible mhd turbulence .",
    "we found :    * we confirm klb s results with higher resolution cubes that sonic mach number has dependence on the 3rd and 4th order moments .",
    "* correlations of kinetic energy density vs. density are linear for supersonic cases and show no correlation for subsonic cases * magnetic energy increases with density clumps for supersonic turbulence . * for the super - alfvnic cases , the local alfvn mach number , i.e. @xmath88 , of clumps increases up to the mean density then falls of as b increases with increasing density clumps . * for sub - alfvnic cases , the local @xmath89 increases with density for both supersonic and subsonic cases .",
    "* correlations of magnetic field vs. column density are linear for supersonic turbulence and are strongest when the field is perpendicular to the los .",
    "* correlations of velocity dispersion vs. column density show a degree of linearity and are strongest when the mean magnetic field is perpendicular to the los .",
    "* subsonic velocity dispersions are not strongly effected by density fluctuations . * applying the bispectrum to density fields of mhd turbulence we find that : 1 .",
    "there are strong correlations for cases where @xmath6 2 .",
    "there are virtually no correlations for @xmath8 for subsonic cases .",
    "supersonic models show the strongest @xmath8 correlations .",
    "4 .   the introduction of a magnetic field enhances correlations for all @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",

    "<S> we present a number of statistical tools that show promise for obtaining information on turbulence in molecular clouds and diffuse interstellar medium . for our tests we make use of three - dimensional @xmath0 compressible mhd isothermal simulations performed for different sonic , i.e. @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the injection velocity , @xmath3 is the sound velocity , and alfvnic @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the alfvn velocity , mach numbers . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the bispectrum , a new tool for statistical studies of the interstellar medium which , unlike an ordinary power spectrum of turbulence , preserves the phase information of the stochastic field . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the bispectra of the 3d stochastic density field and of column densities , available from observations , are similar . </S>",
    "<S> this opens good prospects for studies of molecular clouds and diffuse media with the new tool . </S>",
    "<S> we use the bispectrum technique to define the role of non - linear wave - wave interactions in the turbulent energy cascade . </S>",
    "<S> we also obtained the bispectrum function for density and column densities with varying magnetic field strength . as expected , a strong correlation is obtained for wave modes @xmath6 for all models . </S>",
    "<S> larger values of @xmath7 result in increased correlations for modes with @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this effect becomes more evident with increasing magnetic field intensity . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the different mhd wave modes , e.g. alfvn and magneto - acoustic , which arise in strongly magnetized turbulence , may be responsible for the increased correlations compared to purely hydrodynamical perturbations . in addition to the bispectrum , we calculated the 3rd and 4th statistical moments of density and column density , namely , skewness and kurtosis , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we found a strong dependence of skewness and kurtosis with @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , as @xmath7 increases , so does the gaussian asymmetry of the density distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we also studied the correlations of 2d column density with dispersion of velocities and magnetic field , as well as the correlations of 3d density with magentic and kinetic energy and @xmath9 for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that column density is linearly correlated with magnetic field for high @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this trend is independent of the turbulent kinetic energy and can be used to characterize inhomogeneities of physical properties in low density clumps in the ism . </S>"
