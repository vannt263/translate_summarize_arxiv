    "this pulsar is bright ( @xmath8jy ) , young ( characteristic age @xmath9kyr ) , and energetic ( @xmath10 , for a neutron star moment of inertia @xmath11 ) .",

    "this proximity means that the spindown energy flux at earth , @xmath13 , is second only to that of the crab pulsar and ensures that vela is among the most intensely studied neutron stars , particularly at high energies .    pulsed @xmath0-ray emission from vela was first detected during the _",

    "the source spectrum is hard with an average photon index @xmath15 with evidence of a cut - off above 24gev .",
    "the most detailed study , to date , of the @xmath0-ray pulsations is that of fierro et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , which produced a high signal - to - noise pulse profile and evidence for phase - resolved spectral variations .",
    "as the present work was being prepared for submission , the agile team reported their initial results on @xmath0-ray pulsars , including vela ( pellizoni et al .",
    "2008 ) ; the results , given the more limited count rates and energy resolution , are broadly consistent with our conclusions described below .",
    "with the successful launch of the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope , formerly glast , observatory on june 11 , 2008 , we have a new opportunity to examine the high energy behavior of the vela pulsar and to study this archetype of the young , energetic pulsars in detail . during launch and early operations phase ( l&eo )",

    "the instrument axis is offset north and south of the zenith during alternate orbits to provide near - uniform sky coverage every three hours .",
    "one main purpose of these early observations was to tune the large area telescope ( lat ) performance on celestial @xmath0-ray sources .",

    "the vela pulsar is young and exhibits substantial timing irregularities .",
    "this means that the optimal use of the vela @xmath0-ray photons , which arrive at an orbit - averaged rate of one every 4 minutes during lat sky survey observations , requires a simultaneous radio ephemeris .",
    "the radio ephemeris is obtained using observations made with the 64-m parkes radio telescope as part of the overall program for pulsar monitoring in support of the _ fermi _ mission ( smith et al .",
    "a total of 27 times - of - arrival ( toas ) were obtained at a frequency of 1.4ghz over the period of the lat observations . the median error in each toa is 1.7@xmath22s .",
    "fits to the toas were made with the pulsar s rotational frequency and frequency derivative as free parameters and the ephemeris created from these data maintains phase with an rms residual of 90@xmath22s , or @xmath23 of pulsar phase , throughout the lat observations .",
    "no large timing irregularities or glitches were detected .",
    "an accurate determination of the pulsar s dispersion measure of @xmath24 was obtained by measuring the delay in the toas of the pulse across the 256 mhz bandpass of the 1.4 ghz receiver .",
    "this allows extrapolation of the radio ephemeris to infinite frequency with an error of @xmath1460@xmath22s .",
    "photon arrival times were referred to the solar - system barycenter and pulse phases were assigned using the standard pulsar timing software tempo2 ( hobbs et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "we thus can assign a pulsar phase to the @xmath0-ray photons referenced to the radio with high confidence .",
    "gamma - ray events recorded with the lat have timestamps that derive from a gps clock on the _ fermi _ satellite .",
    "pre - launch ground timing measurements using cosmic muons seen coincidentally in the lat and in an independent counting system demonstrated that the lat measures event times relative to the spacecraft clock with a resolution of better than 300ns .",
    "on orbit , satellite telemetry indicates a comparable resolution .",
    "the contribution to the barycenter times from uncertainty in the lat s position is negligible .",
    "it is also useful to confirm the absolute timing using celestial signals ; as of this writing the six classical pulsars detected by egret have provided good quality lat pulse profiles .",
    "the phasing of the radio and @xmath0-ray peaks is consistent with the best egret results , ensuring absolute timing relative to the radio time system better than @xmath25ms .",
    "the lat instrument on _ fermi _ is described by atwood et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and references therein .",
    "the lat is an electron - positron pair production telescope featuring solid state silicon trackers sensitive to photons from @xmath26mev to @xmath27gev .",
    "it has a large @xmath142.4sr field of view , and compared to earlier @xmath0-ray missions , has a large effective area ( @xmath28 on axis ) , improved resolution ( @xmath29 , 68% containment radius at 1gev for events collected in the ` front ' section with thin radiator foils ) and small dead time ( @xmath30s / event ) .",
    "we report here on the lat s initial observations of the vela pulsar , using data collected during 35 days of on - orbit verification tests and the initial @xmath31 days of the on - going first year sky survey .",
    "these data already suffice to illustrate the power of the lat for astronomical observations and , indeed , show several new features in the radiation of this well - known @xmath0-ray pulsar .",
    "table 1 contains a journal of the vela coverage , along with numbers of photons with measured energy above @xmath32gev recorded within a radius of 5@xmath33 of the pulsar , including background photons . for both pointed and survey observations we exclude events within @xmath34 of the earth s limb to minimize contamination by ` earth albedo ' photons .    during the l&eo period",
    ", the instrument configuration was being tuned for optimum performance .",
    "accordingly , the knowledge of the energy scale and effective area are more limited than for routine operations .",
    "we discuss how these data verify the lat photon selection , effective area , timing , photon energy measurement and the variation of the point spread function ( psf ) with energy .",
    "these results may be of use to researchers seeking to predict _ fermi _ capabilities during longer exposures of fainter sources , in both sky survey and pointed mode .",
    "after calibration of the lat pointing axis on a large set of identified high latitude @xmath0-ray sources , we find that the best fit position of the vela point source is within 0.5@xmath35 of the radio pulsar position with a statistical error of 0.4@xmath35(95% ) ; the lat has unprecedented accuracy for localization of bright hard @xmath0-ray sources , although some systematic uncertainties remain .",
    "the vela pulsar is embedded in the bright @xmath0-ray emission of the galactic plane , which is particularly strong at low energies .",
    "further , the lat , like all pair production telescopes , has an angular resolution dominated by scattering at low photon energies @xmath36 ( see below ) .",
    "thus selection of photons from an energy - dependent region of interest ( roi ) around vela is important ; the best selection depends on the desired product . here ,",
    "we seek pulse profiles with good signal to noise over a broad energy range , so we select photons within an angle @xmath37$]deg of the pulsar position .",
    "this includes a larger fraction of the psf at high energies , where the background is relatively faint .",
    "we use ` diffuse ' class events , those reconstructed events having the highest probability of being photons .    in this energy - dependent aperture",
    "we have 32,400@xmath38242 pulsed photons and @xmath39 background photons with measured energy @xmath40gev .",
    "figure 1 shows the 0.1 - 10gev pulse profile from this roi with the peak of the radio pulsar signal at phase 0 . to highlight the fine structure we plot in figure 1 the pulse profile using variable - width bins , each containing 200 counts .",
    "these counts , divided by the bin width , give the photon flux in each phase interval ; these phase bin fluxes thus have a @xmath41 poisson statistical error of 7% .",
    "the pulse profile is normalized to 100 at the pulse peak .",
    "three insets show structure near the first peak ( p1 ) , second peak ( p2 ) and ` off - pulse ' window at a finer scale .",
    "these peaks are at pulsar phases @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "the peaks are asymmetric .",
    "in particular p2 has a slow rise and a fast fall .",
    "p1 also has a steep outer edge with the fall somewhat slower .",
    "we fit each peak in figure 1 with two half - lorentzian functions ( with different widths for the leading and trailing sides ) over phase intervals which avoided the complex bridge flux ( @xmath44 for p1 , @xmath45 for p2 ) .",
    "the outer edges of the two peaks had consistent lorentzian half - widths of @xmath46 .",
    "extra structure at the pulse peaks made the half maximum widths somewhat smaller ( @xmath47 ; 0.8ms ) .",
    "the falling edge of peak 1 has a lorentzian half width of @xmath48 , while the rising edge of p2 has a width @xmath49 .",
    "both peaks show apparently significant structure on scales as small as @xmath50 ( @xmath51s ) , but additional counts are required to fully probe the pulse profile at this scale .",
    "we also show an inset of the ` off pulse region ' ( @xmath52 ) , with 50 counts / bin to show fine structure . here and in the main panel ,",
    "the dashed line shows the estimated residual unpulsed background counts in our energy - dependent roi , as measured from the pulse minimum .",
    "this is in good agreement with a background level estimated from @xmath53 around the pulsar .",
    "we see that , as for other non - radio vela pulse profiles , there is a faint tail of pulsed emission in this region , reaching non - detectability only near @xmath54 .",
    "we estimate that this ` off pulse ' window contains 235@xmath3815 pulsed photons ( @xmath55 of the pulsed flux ) .         the evolution of the p1/p2 pulse peak ratio ( open circles ) and the p3 pulse peak phase ( solid squares ) with energy . ]",
    "there is dramatic energy evolution in the @xmath0-ray pulse profile .",
    "figure 2 shows pulse profiles from six energy bins , covering three decades of the lat data , drawn from our energy - dependent aperture . note that the relatively large aperture at low energies leads to larger off - pulse flux from the surrounding background .",
    "we should also caution that , with the present limited accuracy in energy measurement below 0.1gev , some higher energy photons may leak into the lowest energy bin .",
    "the most prominent pulse feature is a decrease of p1 relative to p2 with increasing energy ; p1 is not detectable above @xmath1410gev ( figure 2 ) .",
    "this confirms a trend seen in the egret data for the crab , vela and geminga pulsars ",
    "the second pulse dominates at the highest energies ( thompson 2001 ) .",
    "interestingly , at the lower energies , below @xmath56mev , the trend is reversed with p1 weakening again with respect to p2 .",
    "we do not find any statistically significant evidence for shifts in the phases of the narrow p1 and p2 pulse components with energy .",
    "these structures , spanning together @xmath57 of the rotational phase , contain emission dominating over three decades of the pulsar photon output .",
    "the ` bridge ' region between the peaks also shows appreciable structure with a trailing shoulder of p1 shifting to later phase . at @xmath171gev",
    "it is clear that this is a distinct pulse component ( p3 ) with a peak at @xmath58 in the 3 - 10gev band ( figure 2 ) .",
    "note that this peak shifts in phase by @xmath59 between 0.2 and 15gev ( figure 3 ) .        to compare with the lower energy structure ,",
    "we show at bottom left of figure 2 the 8 - 16kev non - thermal x - ray pulse measured by",
    "( harding et al .  2002 ) . on the right",
    "we similarly show the 4.1 - 6.5ev nuv _ hst _ stis / mama pulse profile of romani et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . the 1.4ghz radio pulse profile",
    ", whose peak defines phase @xmath60 , runs across the bottom two panels .",
    "both the optical / uv and the hard x - rays are dominated by non - thermal magnetospheric emission .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath61kev soft x - ray flux is dominated by thermal emission from the neutron star surface ( e.g. manzali , de luca & caraveo 2008 ) , making it much more difficult to trace the non - thermal peaks through this intermediate energy band .",
    "we may compare components in the uv and hard x - ray pulse profiles shown with those of the non - thermal @xmath0-ray pulsations .",
    "in particular , we should note that the @xmath0-ray p1 component is dominant in the non - thermal x - rays .",
    "this component is absent in the optical / uv , but pulse profiles at these energies have a strong peak in the bridge region at @xmath62 , well matched in phase to the p3 structure in the @xmath17gev pulse profiles .",
    "this possible connection between optical pulses and the @xmath0-ray bridge emission was already noted by kanbach et al .",
    "note that the profile for uv energies has a distinct sharp pulse coincident with the radio at @xmath63 .",
    "while the general slope of the faint @xmath64 @xmath0-ray emission matches that of the uv , no sharp @xmath0-ray pulse components are yet visible in this phase interval .",
    "figure 1 makes it clear that the vela extraction region is strongly dominated by the pulsed emission .",
    "however there are substantial phase windows where the pulsar is very faint .",
    "figure 4 presents _ fermi _ @xmath0-ray images of the vela pulsar in three energy bands in the lat range separated into the on- ( @xmath65 ) and off- ( @xmath66 ) pulse phase regions . the images ( except for the low count high energy off - pulse frame )",
    "are smoothed by gaussians ( with @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 for the low to high energy images , respectively ) .",
    "the off - pulse images show the bright diagonal band of the galactic diffuse emission , with appreciable structure . comparison with the psf contours ( red ) show that this is resolved in the vicinity of vela at the higher energies .",
    "while a clump of extended emission surrounds the pulsar position on the few degree scale , it is at present not possible to associate this flux with known vela pwn structures ( e.g. the vela - x tev pwn , contours in the middle energy band ) .",
    "we have subtracted these off- pulse images ( scaled by @xmath70 to normalize exposure ) from the on- pulse images and plotted ( error bars ) the profile of the resulting point source ( bottom panels ) .",
    "the lines show simulations of the expected psf from pre - launch calibrations ( ` pass6 ' ) , computed for a source with a vela - like spectrum and off - axis angles similar to the actual observations .",
    "the agreement is quite good .    as a first attempt at constraining unpulsed ( e.g. pwn ) emission from vela",
    "we have attempted to fit for a point source in the off - pulse phase window , fixed at the position of the pulsar .",
    "using 0.110gev photons in an @xmath34 roi in the @xmath71 phase interval , we derive a 95% cl upper limit on the flux of @xmath72 . after subtracting the estimated remnant pulsed flux in this window ( 0.73% of the phase - averaged flux ) and scaling to the full pulse phase",
    ", this provides a limit on an unpulsed point source at the position of vela of 2.8% of the @xmath73mev pulsed emission count - rate .",
    "more photons , especially at higher energy , will be required to search for a resolved pwn correlated with the tev or radio structures .",
    "to study the phase - averaged spectrum of vela , we used the standard maximum - likelihood spectral estimator ` gtlike ' to be provided with the _ fermi _ ssc science tools .",
    "this fits a source model to the data , along with models for the isotropic ( instrumental and extragalactic ) and structured galactic backgrounds .",
    "the instrumental background was comparable to estimates from pre - launch simulation ( atwood et al .",
    "we used data from the observation spans indicated in table 1 , selecting photons with @xmath74gev within 15@xmath33 of vela .",
    "our basic model for the spectrum of vela is a simple power - law with an exponential cut - off .    with the large number of events collected for vela , the statistical errors are very small .",
    "systematic errors for the lat are still under investigation ( abdo et al .",
    "2009 ) . here",
    "we adopt conservative estimates of the systematic uncertainty in the lat effective area , derived from the on - orbit estimation of the photon selection efficiency as function of energy and off - axis angle .",
    "this estimation has been made by comparing vela on - pulse event selection to event selection in the off - phase bins .",
    "this allows an estimate of the efficiency for a pure photon sample , which is compared with our current simulation of the lat response .",
    "we conducted this exercise for a range of energy and off - axis angle bins , and use the precision of the resulting effective area estimates and the difference from the simulated effective area as an estimate for the uncertainty in the lat effective area as a function of incident photon energy .",
    "this varies from @xmath75 near 1 gev to as much as 20% for energies below 0.1 gev and 30% for energies greater than 10 gev .",
    "the gtlike fit for @xmath76gev is unbinned , and results in a spectrum of the form @xmath77 with @xmath78 in gev , @xmath79 and @xmath80gev .",
    "the first errors are the statistical values for the fit parameters , while the second errors are our propagated systematic uncertainties .",
    "the latter are particularly large for our spectral index parameter @xmath81 because of the large uncertainty at present in the effective area at high and low energies . to explore the stability of this result",
    ", we also fit using three other spectral estimators .",
    "we used a standard xspec analysis with our best model response matrices , a binned maximum likelihood estimator which computes the on - pulse photon counts in a point source weighted aperture in excess of off - pulse background counts ( ` ptlike ' ) and a method which propagates the model spectrum through simulated instrument response to compare with observed pulsed source counts . for additional tests of the stability of the spectral fits , the data were also analyzed separately for ` pointed ' and ` survey ' observations , as well as for events in the front ( thin radiator foil ) and back ( thick radiator foil ) sections of the lat detector .",
    "the fit parameters for the various data sets and analysis techniques , do have some statistically significant variation , but all were well within our presently - estimated systematic errors , as listed in equation ( 1 ) .",
    "we believe that as our understanding of the lat performance improves we should be able to substantially decrease these systematic uncertainties .",
    "figure 5 presents the spectral power @xmath82 along with this best fit model .",
    "the binned spectral points are drawn from the ptlike analysis and show both the statistical error flags ( bars with caps ) and the inferred systematic error flags ( bars without caps ) ; the systematic errors dominate for all energies below 7 gev .",
    "we also plot the egret data points of kanbach et al .",
    "these are discrepant with the lat points , particularly above a few gev .",
    "some studies have indicated that the egret response was incorrectly estimated ( baughman 2007 , stecker et al 2008 ) .",
    "we have also attempted to fit the data with a generalized cut - off model of the form exp[@xmath83 .",
    "we find @xmath84 so that models with a hyper - exponential behavior are well excluded . taking into account the systematic errors the spectrum is fully consistent with the simple exponential @xmath85 cut - off . to check the exclusion of a given hyper - exponential model we compute the probability of incorrect rejection of a given @xmath86 value using the likelihood ratio test . for example",
    ", if only statistical errors are included @xmath87 is rejected at 16.5@xmath88 ; inflating the errors to the level of our estimated systematic uncertainty leads to a small , but not negligible , 0.29% chance of incorrectly rejecting the @xmath87 model .",
    "the analyses of kanbach et al .",
    "( 1980 ) , grenier et al .  ( 1988 ) and fierro et al .",
    "( 1995 ) already showed that there is significant spectral variation through the pulse , with the bridge region harder than the peaks .",
    "clearly , in figure 2 we see that the situation is even more complicated , with three or more overlapping physical components contributing to the energy - dependent pulse profiles .",
    "also , in figure 5 , one sees that there may be emission in the highest energy bins in excess of a simple exponentially cut - off model .",
    "this likely arises from the extended hard spectrum of the p2 component , and drives the best - fit value for @xmath86 below 1 .",
    "clearly the phase - averaged spectrum is a superposition of emission from a variety of distinct physical regions , and we can not expect a simple cut - off power - law spectral model to be an exact representation of the data .",
    "reduced systematic errors and the photons of a year or more of lat data will be required to explore the phase - resolved spectral structure .",
    "the early lat data have already greatly clarified the @xmath0-ray emission of the vela pulsar and , even before detailed phase - resolved spectral measurements and model comparisons , significantly constrain the origin of high energy pulsar emission .",
    "pulsar particle acceleration is believed to occur in the open zone , on the field lines above each magnetic pole which extend through the light cylinder .",
    "these subtend @xmath89 of pulsar phase at high altitude , so with a total phase in the narrow pulses of @xmath90 one would expect a comparable fraction of the open zone , and hence fraction of the spin - down power , to contribute to the @xmath0-ray emission . the narrow peaks are often interpreted as caustics ( morini 1983 ; romani & yadigaroglu 1995 , dyks et al .",
    "2004 ) , where the combination of field retardation , aberration and time delay causes emission from the boundary of an acceleration zone ( gap ) to pile up in pulsar phase .",
    "a simple pulse from a 1-d fold caustic would increase to a maximum as @xmath91 $ ] as one approaches the destruction of an image pair at phase @xmath92 or fall off in mirror form after image pair creation .",
    "p2 structure with a slow rise and abrupt fall looks like a trailing ( image pair destruction ) caustic , albeit with a steeper increase to the maximum , suggesting intensity variation along the emission surface or a higher - order catastrophe .",
    "the shape of p1 is less clear , but the apparent fast rise and slow fall would indicate a leading ( image pair creation ) caustic ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the broad structure of the p3 interpulse region suggests a beam of emission from a bundle of field lines bracketed by the two caustic - forming zones .",
    "the similarity between the @xmath0-ray p3 phase structure and that of the lower frequency optical / uv emission at @xmath93 suggests a common origin ",
    "they both cover similar phase intervals and the peak shifts to later phase at higher energy .",
    "one appealing possibility is to associate the optical / uv p3 with synchrotron emission from relatively low altitude pair cascades produced by the few - gev curvature radiation dominating the @xmath94 spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "these @xmath95e@xmath96 pairs , with electron energy @xmath97 , will produce synchrotron emission with characteristic peak energy @xmath98kev as they radiate away their pitch angle @xmath99 radians in a magnetic field of @xmath100 g .",
    "for vela , we have @xmath101 , so to produce @xmath102 ev photons the pairs would reside at @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the neutron star radius . if the synchrotron emission is outward beamed , along with the pairs , then the compton scattered flux would appear at @xmath105gev , matching the lat p3 component .",
    "this suggests that the pulse of seed photons at ir to uv energies should have energy - dependent phase shifts tracking their compton - up - scattered p3 progeny .",
    "while the vlbi parallax provides a well - determined distance of @xmath106pc , the pattern of the @xmath0-ray beam and hence the true @xmath0-ray luminosity are uncertain . to compute the true luminosity",
    "@xmath107 we need a correction factor @xmath108 from the observed phase - averaged energy flux f@xmath109 at the earth line of sight ( at angle @xmath110 to the rotation axis ) to an average over the sky . for a given model ,",
    "the correction depends on the geometry , so we have @xmath111 where the model for a given magnetic inclination @xmath112 from the rotation axis gives @xmath113 , the pulse profile as a function of phase @xmath114 seen at viewing angle @xmath115 .",
    "@xmath116 is the expected phase - averaged flux for the actual earth line - of - sight @xmath110 . in general highly - aligned models , such as the polar cap scenario ,",
    "have small sky coverage and @xmath117 , while outer - magnetosphere models have much larger @xmath108 ( romani & yadigaroglu 1995 ) . for vela",
    ", the viewing angle is estimated to be @xmath118 from the geometry of the _ chandra x - ray observatory_-measured x - ray torus ( ng & romani 2008 ) . the magnetic impact angle @xmath119 is constrained by the radio polarization data .",
    "together , these allow us to compute the high energy beam shape ( assuming uniform emissivity along gap surfaces ) .",
    "for the outer gap ( og ) picture we compute @xmath120 for @xmath121 .",
    "for the two - pole caustic ( tpc ) model appropriate to the slot gap picture , we find @xmath122 ( watters et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the observed energy flux obtained by integrating @xmath123 times the photon number flux in equation ( 1 ) over the range 0.1@xmath710gev is ( 7.87@xmath124)@xmath12510@xmath126ergs/@xmath127/s .",
    "for a distance of 0.287 kpc , the @xmath0-ray luminosity of vela is then 7.8@xmath125 10@xmath128ergs / s .",
    "thus the observed @xmath0-ray flux implies an efficiency of @xmath129 with @xmath130 for both the og and tpc models .",
    "note that this is a substantial fraction of the geometrical bound on the efficiency from the peak widths noted above .",
    "three general classes of models have been discussed for @xmath0-ray pulsars . in polar cap models",
    "( daugherty & harding 1994 , 1996 ; sturner & dermer 1995 ; harding & muslimov 2004 ) , the particle acceleration and @xmath0-ray production takes place in the open field line region within one stellar radius of the magnetic pole of the neutron star . in outer gap models ( cheng , ho & ruderman 1986 ; romani 1996 ; hirotani 2005 )",
    ", the interaction region lies in the outer magnetosphere in vacuum gaps associated with the last open field line .",
    "other recent models hark back to the ` slot - gap ' picture of arons ( 1983 ) , with the polar cap rim acceleration extending to many stellar radii ( harding & muslimov 2004 ) .",
    "the appreciable offset from the radio peak , coupled with the presence of only one radio pulse , suggests that the @xmath0-rays arise at high altitude .",
    "this is also supported by the lack of hyper - exponential absorption in the spectrum , which is a signature of @xmath0-b pair attenuation of low altitude emission .",
    "the remaining two geometrical models can produce the general double peak profile of vela ( and many other @xmath0-ray pulsars ) .",
    "in ` outer gap ' models emission starts near the ` null charge ' @xmath131 surface at radius @xmath132 and extends toward the light cylinder @xmath133 .",
    "one magnetic pole dominates the emission in each hemisphere and the two peaks represent leading and trailing edges of the hollow cone of emission from this pole . if on the other hand emission extends well below the null charge surface toward the neutron star , both magnetic poles can contribute toward emission in a given hemisphere",
    "this is the two - pole caustic model of dyks & rudak ( 2003 ) which might be realized in ` slot gap ' acceleration models . in this case",
    "the leading ` image pair creation ' caustic from high altitudes should not be visible , and the first @xmath0-ray pulse represents the trailing caustic from emission at @xmath134 below the null - charge surface ( the radio magnetic pole ) while the second pulse represents a trailing caustic at higher altitudes from the opposite pole ; both pulses should generally show a slow rise and steeper fall .",
    "detailed @xmath0-ray pulse profiles and , especially , phase resolved spectra can help distinguish these scenarios .",
    "another geometric difference in the two scenarios is the origin of the emission outside the main pulse .",
    "low altitude field lines in the two - pole model tend to produce emission along all lines of sight . in the outer gap picture",
    "high altitude field lines can contribute faint emission extending through the off pulse region .",
    "further , as noted above , the energy spectrum also presents challenges for near - surface emission .",
    "in the polar cap models , a sharp turnover is expected in the few to 10gev energy range due to attenuation of the @xmath0-ray flux in the magnetic field ( daugherty & harding 1996 ) .",
    "the spectral change at @xmath142.9gev does not appear to fit this model .",
    "we conclude that low altitude radiation subject to @xmath0-b pair production can not account for the bulk of the vela @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "indeed we can use the observed cut - off to estimate a minimum emission height as @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the unabsorbed photon energy , @xmath6 is the spin period and the surface field is @xmath137 g ( baring 2004 ) .",
    "using vela parameters ( @xmath138s , @xmath139 ) we see that our cut - off implies that the bulk of the emission arises from @xmath140 .",
    "since we see pulsed photons up to @xmath141gev , this emission must arise at @xmath142 .",
    "a similar conclusion has been recently made for the crab pulsar by the magic team , who observe pulsed @xmath143gev emission , using the imaging air cerenkov technique ( aliu et al .",
    "finally , it should be noted that while typical radio pulsar emission is inferred to arise at relatively low altitudes , for vela - type pulsars recent radio models infer emission heights of as much as @xmath144 ( karastergiou & johnston 2007 ) .",
    "all of these factors point to a high - altitude origin of the vela @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "the early lat observations of vela serve to show that the instrument is performing very well , with effective area comparable to expectations , good psfs and excellent source localization , especially at high energies .",
    "the time - tagging of events is excellent and our pulse profile reconstruction is limited primarily by the accuracy of the radio - derived pulsar ephemeris .",
    "this presently has an accuracy of @xmath14100@xmath22s over our analyzed data span .",
    "the energy response and effective area calibration are currently being validated , but are at present known to @xmath145% near 1gev , with uncertainties increasing to @xmath146% at @xmath147gev and @xmath148% at @xmath149gev .",
    "these data also substantially improve our knowledge of the pulse properties of the vela pulsar ( psr b0833@xmath745 ) and are now placing important constraints on theoretical models . already in these data we see :      \\2 .",
    "although the p1 and p2 phases are very stable across the @xmath0-ray band , the the p1/p2 ratio decreases with energy .",
    "there is a distinct third peak in the ` bridge ' component which sharpens and moves to later pulsar phase with increasing energy .",
    "\\3 . while faint emission appears within @xmath150 of the pulsar in the off - pulse phase , association if any with vela is still unclear , due to the bright galactic background in the vicinity .",
    "we thus quote an upper limit on the unpulsed point source flux , at 2.8% of the phase - averaged pulsed flux .",
    "a true pwn association will require additional data , allowing resolution at higher energies and a match to the radio and tev images .",
    ". the phase - averaged @xmath0-ray energy spectrum can be represented by a power law , with a exponential cut - off at @xmath151 gev .",
    "the hyper - exponential cut - off index @xmath152 is not significantly different from the simple exponential value @xmath85 .",
    "large values of @xmath86 , as expected for models radiating from the near - surface polar cap zone , are excluded .    during the first - year sky survey",
    ", we expect to collect approximately @xmath153 additional pulsed vela photons .",
    "this will allow a substantial increase in sensitivity to narrow pulse components .",
    "we also expect improvements in our understanding of the instrument that will allow us to significantly reduce systematic errors .",
    "these two improvements will allow derivation of high accuracy spectral properties in more than 100 bins of pulsar phase .",
    "these are the observational results that should let us pin down the location and energy distribution of the radiating particles . in turn",
    "this should help us ` reverse - engineer ' this @xmath0-ray machine and should provide substantial insight into the physics of pulsar magnetospheres .",
    "the glast lat collaboration acknowledges the generous support of a number of agencies and institutes that have supported the development of the lat .",
    "these include the national aeronautics and space administration and the department of energy in the united states , the commissariat  lenergie atomique and the centre national de la recherche scientifique / institut national de physique nuclaire et de physique des particules in france , the agenzia spaziale italiana , the istituto nazionale di fisica nucleare , and the istituto nazionale di astrofisica in italy , the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology ( mext ) , high energy accelerator research organization ( kek ) and japan aerospace exploration agency ( jaxa ) in japan , and the k. a. wallenberg foundation and the swedish national space board in sweden ."
