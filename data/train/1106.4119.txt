    "as is well - known , there is a @xmath12-adic , or more general nonarchimedean , analogue of uniformization of riemann surfaces by schottky groups , namely , mumford s theory of uniformization by nonarchimedean schottky groups ( cf .",

    "let @xmath19 be such that @xmath20 , i.e. , let @xmath21 , with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "then the following equation describes a so called artin - schreier - mumford curve over @xmath17 : @xmath24 the reduction of this curve , i.e. , the curve modulo @xmath16 over the residue field , which in this example is the finite field @xmath25 , is given by @xmath26 the solution of this equation forms a `` chess board '' of @xmath27 horizontal an @xmath27 vertical copies of @xmath28 .",
    "this object is what is called the special fibre of the curve .",
    "the very same mumford curve can also be obtained by a uniformization process .",
    "the uniformizing space is the nonarchimedean analytic space @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the limit set of a schottky group @xmath31 , which acts by mbius transformations properly discontinuously on @xmath32 , having a limit set contained @xmath33 .",

    "let us first explain why an obvious analog of the complex analytic statement is false .",
    "a nonarchimedean schottky group @xmath50 is also a group of automorphisms of the tree @xmath60 spanned by the limit set as a subtree of the bruhat - tits tree over the residue field of @xmath18 .",
    "this limit set indeed carries a patterson - sullivan measure of dimension @xmath61 ( see section [ trees ] ) , but absolute continuity of a boundary map for two such groups will only imply conjugacy of schottky groups in the isometry group of the tree , _ not _ inside @xmath62 .",
    "now @xmath63 is much larger than its `` linear cousin '' @xmath62 , and conjugacy of schottky groups inside @xmath63 is , as we will see , only equivalent to an isomorphism of the _ special fibers _ of the two curves .",
    "there are many non - isomorphic curves with isomorphic special fibers  actually , for any given curve , uncountably many .",
    "another manifestation of this fact is the statement that the group @xmath64 has uncountably many conjugacy classes inside @xmath62 , but only countably many inside @xmath65 ( this observation was communicated to us by lubotzky , compare @xcite ) .    to remedy this problem",
    ", we suggest to consider , in addition to patterson - sullivan measure , the so - called _ harmonic measures of weight @xmath66 _ on the boundary , in the sense of schneider and teitelbaum ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "* the special fibers of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are isomorphic if and only if there is an isometry @xmath85 which conjugates the schottky groups @xmath86 , if and only if the corresponding patterson - sullivan measures are of the same conformal dimension and the map @xmath6 is absolutely continuous for these measures .",
    "+ if this is the case , then pullback by @xmath87 induces an isomorphism of the spaces of harmonic measures @xmath88 * suppose that the curves @xmath89 are not hyperelliptic .",

    "the relations in @xmath95 are only necessary if @xmath47 is trigonal ( i.e. , admits a map @xmath96 of degree 3 ) , or if @xmath47 is isomorphic to a plane quintic .",
    "the theorem says that when the usual measure - theoretic property of absolute continuity with respect to patterson - sullivan measure is enhanced to include preservation of linear relations in three finite - dimensional vector spaces of harmonic measures , then rigidity of mumford curves follows .",
    "note that mumford proved in ( @xcite , corollary 4.11 ) that two mumford curves with schottky groups in @xmath62 are isomorphic over @xmath17 if and only if the corresponding schottky groups are conjugate over @xmath18 .",
    "we do not know at present how to deal with the hyperelliptic case .",
    "the proof of the theorem uses the theorem of petri et al .  on the equations for the image of the canonical embedding of a non - hyperelliptic curve .",
    "the poisson kernel theorem of teitelbaum is used to translate this algebro - geometric statement back into a statement about harmonic measures .",
    "the contents of the paper is as follows : in the first part , we prove a version of coornaert s ergodic rigidity theorem for two different trees ( the original theorem was for one tree ) , and apply it to the intersection dual graph of the special fibre of two mumford curves  this will prove the first part of the theorem .",
