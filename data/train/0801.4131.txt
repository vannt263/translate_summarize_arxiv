    "much recent work has been devoted to the detailed experimental , simulational and theoretical analyses of the dynamics of low temperature plasticity in amorphous systems @xcite .",
    "the systems of interest include noncrystalline solids well below their glass temperature @xmath1 , dense granular materials , and various kinds of soft materials such as foams , colloids , and the like . in spite of these efforts there",
    "remain fundamental open questions that call for further investigation .",
    "some of the most important emerging new results pointed to the central role played by the concept of an effective disorder temperature @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that although conventional thermal fluctuations are of little importance for thermal temperatures well below the glass transition temperature @xmath1 or absent in purely athermal systems , the state of configurational disorder of the deforming system can be characterized by an effective disorder temperature @xmath0 that controls configurational fluctuations @xcite . however ,",
    "a well - established equation of motion for @xmath0 is still missing .",
    "the aim of the present work is to discuss such an equation of motion and to rationalize its structure based on general considerations .",
    "the recent steady state simulations by haxton and liu ( hl ) @xcite are shown to be consistent with the equation and are used to determine important ingredients of the theory .",
    "predictions for transient dynamics are presented and shown to agree with experimental findings . finally , open questions are discussed",
    ".    there has been some recent discussion in the literature regarding the mathematical rigor , validity and generality of the concept of an effective temperature .",
    "it turns out that some measures of an effective temperature agreed numerically with one another , while others did not @xcite .",
    "furthermore , an exact solution of a simple non - equilibrium model shows that there exists a full hierarchy of effective temperatures , that although might agree rather well numerically , have different analytic forms @xcite .",
    "therefore , it seems that for non - equilibrium systems there are many ways to define a temperature that quantifies deviations from thermal equilibrium , many of which yield numerically consistent values ( for reasons that are not yet well understood ) , but some do not .",
    "it is thus natural to ask how can one proceed to develop a theory based on a concept that is not yet completely well - founded ?",
    "my answer is that there exists ample evidence for the existence and importance of an intensive macroscopic state variable that characterizes the state of disorder of driven amorphous systems ( see below ) and therefore one should try to make progress in a phenomenological way based on general considerations and experimental / simulational findings . in saying so ,",
    "i do not mean that we should give up trying to develop a rigorous effective temperature formalism . on the contrary , this is a major and fundamental challenge .",
    "my main point is that one can make significant progress even in the absence of such an exact formalism .    from a fundamental point of view",
    "it is clear that a deformation theory of amorphous systems must include a measure of disorder as a basic dynamical ingredient ; structural disorder is an essential feature of these systems .",
    "furthermore , we have a lot of evidence for structural evolution during deformation @xcite .",
    "we also know that deformation history depends on the system preparation procedure , which is naturally accounted for by assigning different states of initial disorder to different preparation procedures @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are experiments in which significant structural differences between a material within a shear band and a material outside the band were observed , indicating a structural sensitivity to the rate of deformation ( or the rate of energy dissipation ) @xcite . in fact , there is evidence for structural softening , in addition to thermal softening , within shear bands @xcite .",
    "recent experiments show that macroscopic quantities like the shear modulus are functions of the deformation @xcite , a point that will be elaborated on later .",
    "an excellent example of these effects was given recently in a series of simulations by demkowicz and argon @xcite .",
    "these authors were able to identify and quantify local structural features of their deforming simulated amorphous silicon .",
    "they followed the evolution of these structural measures and demonstrated beautifully the effect of the system preparation procedure on transient dynamics as well as the approach to a unique steady state ( independent of initial conditions ) under persistent deformation .",
    "similar evidence for the existence of steady state of the disorder was found earlier @xcite . in my opinion",
    ", all this accumulating evidence is pointing towards the need to develop a description of the evolution of disorder in driven amorphous systems and its relation with plastic deformation along physically sensible guidelines , even prior to the availability of an exact non - equilibrium formalism .",
    "the term `` athermal '' is used in this work to refer to situations in which spontaneous thermal fluctuations are incapable of inducing structural rearrangements .",
    "therefore , in these situations plastic deformation occurs only in response to external driving forces .",
    "for example , such conditions are relevant for glasses well below their glass transition temperature or for granular media and foams where thermal fluctuations are practically nonexistent . by using this term",
    "we by no means imply that thermal vibrations or dissipative mechanisms like friction in granular media or viscosity in foams are not important ; on the contrary these processes are crucial for our discussion below , where they provide a means to remove energy irreversibly from the deforming system once structural rearrangements induced by the external driving forces take place .",
    "the ideas developed hereafter are presented in a way that makes explicit reference to vibrational motion .",
    "however , the resulting framework applies equally well to systems where thermal vibrations are completely absent .    in the next section an athermal dynamics for @xmath0",
    "are proposed and discussed in relation to a deformation theory .",
    "the resulting dynamics are compared to the steady state haxton and liu ( hl ) data @xcite in sect .",
    "[ simulation ] . in sect .",
    "[ transient ] we go beyond the steady state analysis to predict some transient effects . section [ sum ] offers a summary and some discussion .",
    "the basic starting point for the discussion of the effective temperature dynamics is the separation of the total amount of degrees of freedom of the system under consideration to fast vibrational and slow configurational ones .",
    "this separation , known as the `` inherent states '' formalism @xcite , was shown to provide a proper framework to describe glassy dynamics ; the phase space dynamics are such that the system remains in the basin of a single minimum in the potential energy landscape ( an `` inherent state '' or a `` configuration '' ) for a long time compared to the particles vibration timescale until it makes a transition to another basin @xcite .",
    "our goal here is to extend these ideas to dissipative , driven ( out of mechanical equilibrium ) amorphous systems .    in the athermal limit considered in this work the transitions between the `` inherent states '' occur only as a result of the applied forces and not due to spontaneous thermal fluctuations that are assumed to be inefficient at low enough temperatures .",
    "the response of such systems to the application of external driving forces typically contains a reversible ( elastic ) and an irreversible ( plastic ) components .",
    "the plastic component , usually termed the plastic part of the rate of deformation tensor , is denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "the plastic work density per unit time is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the deviatoric part of the stress tensor . at low temperatures , well below the glass transition one ,",
    "non of this energy can be stored reversibly , implying that @xmath3 is all dissipated @xcite .    in light of the separation of degrees of freedom",
    "we can write the total heat flux @xmath5 as @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 stand for vibrational and configurational respectively . generally speaking ,",
    "@xmath9 is the energy flux that is being removed irreversibly from the deforming system to its surroundings . in atomic or molecular systems at a finite @xmath10 , it is being transferred to the heat bath by thermal vibrations . in systems where thermal vibrations are absent ,",
    "some other physical mechanism like internal friction in granular media or viscosity in foams , is responsible for irreversibly removing energy from the deforming system .",
    "@xmath11 is the rate of change of the energy density stored in the configurational degrees of freedom .",
    "the energy dissipation rate equals the total heat flux , therefore @xmath12 following langer @xcite we propose that the configurational degrees of freedom are characterized by an effective disorder temperature @xmath0 , possibly different from the bath temperature @xmath10 , such that @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the configurational specific heat of units @xmath15 per unit volume . using eqs .",
    "( [ total_heat])-([teff_dot ] ) we obtain @xmath16 the quantity @xmath9 , as explained above , represents the rate at which energy is removed irreversibly from the deforming system to the heat bath . in general , a first principles calculation that accounts for the detailed processes that involve heat exchanges with the bath is well beyond the scope of the present work and is anyway an extremely difficult task .",
    "however , the athermal limit implies some simplifications . in that limit",
    ", @xmath9 vanishes in the absence of plastic deformations , i.e. when @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , @xmath9 is a scalar that is related to dissipation and has the dimension of energy density per unit time .",
    "these properties are naturally accounted for by assuming that @xmath9 is proportional to the plastic power density @xmath3 , i.e. that @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a dimensionless function . this function has a clear physical meaning as it represents the fraction of the plastic power density @xmath3 that is being transformed into regular heat .",
    "for example , when it equals unity all the plastic power density @xmath3 is converted into regular heat and non of it is being stored in the configurational degrees of freedom .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ vib_heat ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ teff_dot ] ) we obtain @xmath20 \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the structure of this equation is consistent with the original equation proposed by langer @xcite .",
    "following these ideas , we can write the total entropy density @xmath21 as @xmath22 and identify @xmath23 the last relation implies that @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the configurational energy density ( `` inherent states '' energy density ) .",
    "( [ teff_der ] ) can serve as a definition of the effective temperature ( also called the configurational temperature ) and in fact was used in relation to edwards hypothesis @xcite in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that a generalized statistical mechanics for the `` inherent states '' can be developed .",
    "more important to our discussion here are the results of @xcite that show that eq .",
    "( [ teff_der ] ) yields values of @xmath0 that are consistent with standard thermodynamic relations applied to out of equilibrium systems . note also that the above relations imply that for out of equilibrium situations , i.e. when @xmath26 , we have @xmath27 which is an expected violation of a standard thermodynamic relation .",
    "the development up to now focused on a quasi - thermodynamic interpretation of the effective temperature @xmath0 . in this spirit , it is natural to ask whether gradients of @xmath0 drive a configurational heat flux from high to low @xmath0 regions , in analogy with a regular temperature behavior .",
    "alternatively , we can ask whether a diffusion term of the form @xmath28 should be added to the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ teff_dot1 ] ) , where @xmath29 is an effective diffusion coefficient . from the discussion above it is clear that if @xmath0 diffuses , it must be associated with plastic flow , i.e. with @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , dimensional analysis suggests that @xmath31 .",
    "the most natural phenomenon in which this behavior should be observed is shear banding .",
    "when shear banding occurs , we expect a high @xmath0 region ( inside the band , where @xmath32 is large ) to coexist with a low @xmath0 region ( outside the band , where @xmath32 is small ) , see for example @xcite .",
    "indeed , the shear banding simulations of @xcite suggest that the width of the shear band broadens diffusively , i.e. as a function of strain ( or time ) to the power @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "this also implies that the rate of broadening is proportional to @xmath32 in the band .",
    "a systematic analysis of such effects is needed in order to provide further support for the diffusivity of @xmath0 . in this work",
    "we focus on homogeneous situations , such that we can omit a possible diffusion term in eq .",
    "( [ teff_dot1 ] ) .",
    "( [ teff_dot1 ] ) becomes useful only if @xmath34 and @xmath19 are known .",
    "we first discuss @xmath34 in the framework of the recently proposed shear - transformation - zones ( stz ) theory @xcite .",
    "building on early `` flow - defect '' ideas @xcite , this theory views the plastic deformation of an amorphous solid as consisting of finite strain , localized , irreversible rearrangements that take place in response to applied forces .",
    "a major theoretical challenge is the calculation of the probability of occurrence of these these irreversible `` events '' , the so - called shear transformations , or more precisely the rate of events which gives rise to a macroscopic plastic rate of deformation @xmath34 .",
    "the stz theory culminates in the following expression for @xmath34 @xcite @xmath35 which is valid in the absence of extremely fast transients @xcite .",
    "the validity of this form was demonstrated recently in a shear banding simulation @xcite .",
    "let us discuss the physical meaning of this expression .",
    "the boltzmann - like factor constitutes the configurational part of @xmath34 , a part that is proportional to the probability to find a local configurational fluctuation that might enable a plastic event to take place .",
    "more explicitly , in light of eq .",
    "( [ teff_der ] ) and in the spirit of ref .",
    "@xcite , we postulate that the probability to observe a free energy fluctuation @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 the free energy @xmath38 represents the existence of a minimal free energy fluctuation below which a shear transformation can not occur at all , making the cumulative probability to find a potential site for a plastic event proportional to @xmath39 as appears in eq .",
    "( [ dpl ] ) .    the additional multiplicative term @xmath40 represents that fact that the existence of a potential site for a plastic event does not immediately imply the occurrence of an event .",
    "there are also dynamic factors that determine the actual rate of irreversible events .",
    "first , the time scale @xmath41 determines the basic attempt period and was proposed to be of the order of the vibration time scale for atomic systems @xcite . for other systems ,",
    "this time scale is the characteristic relaxation time ; such a time scale always exists , even when thermal fluctuations are absent .",
    "the other factor @xmath42 quantifies the explicit dependence of @xmath2 on the deviatoric stress @xmath43 .",
    "the existence of such a term is anticipated on the basis of symmetry as @xmath2 is a tensorial quantity .",

    "( [ dpl ] ) , stz theory provides an expression for the rate of irreversible ( plastic ) events , incorporating both configurational and dynamic factors .",

    "an information of the type we are looking for became available recently through the remarkable steady state simulations by haxton and liu ( hl ) @xcite .",
    "these authors performed molecular dynamics simulations of a purely repulsive binary glass , made of equal proportion of small and large particles and sheared steadily under a fixed area fraction .",
    "we write the tensors in the problem as @xmath47 and similarly for @xmath44 ; we stress the fact that there is only one independent component in each one of them , making the problem effectively scalar .",
    "note also that under fixed area the pressure is expected to vary with deformation . modeling direct pressure effects , for example",
    "the dependence of the yield stress on the pressure , requires additional approximations and assumptions that are not essential for the present discussion .",
    "we therefore keep adopting the assumption made above that plastic deformation is mainly coupled to the deviatoric part of the stress and neglect additional pressure effects .",
    "the ordinary thermal temperature @xmath10 in the hl simulations was varied systematically from well above the glass temperature to well below and three orders of magnitude of imposed total rate of deformation @xmath48 were studied , ranging from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , where @xmath41 is roughly the binary collision time .",
    "the effective temperature was evaluated using a relation between the static linear response and the variance of the pressure .",
    "the crucial point is that this measurement of @xmath0 was shown in @xcite to yield values that are numerically consistent with our definition of eq .",
    "( [ teff_der ] ) , making hl data most relevant for the developed formalism .",
    "since our main interest here is in the athermal limit , we focus on the low temperatures data and take the @xmath51 results , where @xmath52 is estimated from a vogel - fulcher fit of the equilibrium viscosity , as a representative example .",
    "all the results are given in units of @xmath41 , the particle mass , the small particles diameter , the interaction energy scale and @xmath53 .",
    "it is important to note that as the total rate of deformation @xmath48 was controlled in these numerical experiments and only steady states were considered , the deviatoric stress @xmath54 is always larger than the yield stress @xmath55 , which is defined as @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "the steady state deviatoric stress @xmath58 , as well as the steady state effective temperature @xmath59 , were measured as a function of the normalized imposed total rate of deformation @xmath60 .",
    "a relation between the two was found to be of the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are independent of both @xmath10 ( for @xmath64 ) and @xmath65 .",

    "( [ vib_heat1 ] ) presents a physically meaningful result and not merely a fudge factor , in light of role played by @xmath0 in the proposed theory .",
    "this exponential boltzmann - like factor must be related to the distribution of inherent states that determines the probability of increasing / decreasing the energy stored in the configurational degrees of freedom during irreversible plastic rearrangements , though additional theoretical work is needed in order to derive it from first principles .",
    "an important feature of eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) is that the fraction of @xmath3 that is converted to regular heat is an increasing function of @xmath0 .",

    "this dependence is such that @xmath70 decreases with increasing @xmath71 , if we think of @xmath0 as fixed ( which is not the case ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath70 in eq .",

    "this kind of non - analyticity was criticized in @xcite as being unlikely to arise from any first principles analysis of molecular mechanisms .",

    "first , we expect @xmath88 to be a monotonically increasing function of @xmath71 .",
    "furthermore , following @xcite , we expect that for small stresses the dynamics of plastic rearrangements involve barrier crossings between different inherent states in the energy landscape .",

    "figure [ cycle_s ] shows the normalized deviatoric stress @xmath130 as a function of the external strain @xmath131 .",
    "the figure exhibits a rather generic behavior where there exists a stress peak followed by strain softening in the first half cycle and a softer response in the second half cycle due to memory effects associated with @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , fig .",
    "[ cycle_teff ] shows the corresponding plot for the effective disorder temperature @xmath0 as a function of the imposed strain @xmath132 .",
    "the qualitative new feature observed is that during transients @xmath0 might exhibit a _",

    "@xmath0 overshoots the steady state value @xmath59 , while during the second half cycle it undershoots @xmath59 .",
    "this effect becomes more pronounced as the imposed rate of deformation is increased .",
    "the physical origin of the non - monotonic behavior is the dependence of @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) on the stress @xmath71 , in addition to @xmath0 . if @xmath70 were a function of @xmath0 alone , then for all cases in which the initial value of @xmath0 is smaller than the steady state one , eq .",
    "( [ teff_dot1 ] ) would predict a monotonic increase of @xmath0 , irrespective of the dynamics of the stress @xmath71 .",
    "however , the dependence of @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) on the stress @xmath71 , allows for a non - monotonic behavior of @xmath0 during transients .",
    "for example , during the first half of the loading cycle discussed above , @xmath133 becomes unity while the stress is still decreasing in the strain softening part observed in fig .",
    "[ cycle_s ] .",
    "that implies that @xmath133 in eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) temporarily overshoots unity such that @xmath134 becomes _",
    "negative_. this behavior suggests a somewhat surprising physical phenomenon in which during deformation transients energy stored in the configurational degrees of freedom is released , i.e. @xmath135 , and converted into regular heat such that the amount of heat being removed from the system to its surroundings is _ larger _ than the plastic power @xmath3 .",
    "the predicted non - monotonic behavior of @xmath0 during transients can be tested directly in laboratory experiments . for that aim ,",
    "consider the heat equation for the regular temperature @xmath10 @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the thermal diffusion coefficient and @xmath8 is the thermal specific heat of units @xmath15 per unit volume .",
    "note that thermoelastic effects were neglected here . under sufficiently fast deformation",
    "the heat conduction term can be neglected , leading to adiabatic conditions .",
    "therefore , a direct time - dependent measurement of both @xmath138 and @xmath3 allows the determination of @xmath133 .",
    "in fact , such a procedure was realized and reported in @xcite . in this work",
    "the temperature rise during high strain rates deformation of a glassy polymer was measured .",
    "the real - time temperature measurements were obtained by using embedded thermocouples and transient high strain rates of up to @xmath139 were obtained by impact boundary conditions .",
    "the plastic power was evaluated by subtracting the elastic power from the total one .",
    "then , the time - dependent temperature record and the known value of @xmath8 in eq .",

    "the most striking result was that @xmath70 became _ larger _ than unity during fast transients .",
    "moreover , the effect took place during the strain softening part of the stress - strain curve and was more pronounced as the strain rate was increased , all in perfect agreement with the predictions of the proposed theory . therefore , the results reported in @xcite clearly demonstrate an important physical effect that emerges from our equations .    the discussion that follows eq .",
    "( [ heat_equationt ] ) points to a possible limitation of the hl simulations .",
    "the idea is that if strain rates of @xmath141 already lead to adiabatic conditions and therefore to a non - negligible temperature rise , then the enormous rates of deformation reached in hl simulations ( up to @xmath142 per unit atomic vibration , see fig .",
    "[ hl ] ) must lead to melting of their glass due to the inability of the material to conduct heat sufficiently fast .",
    "this physical effect was most probably avoided in the simulations by allowing the numerical thermostat to pump energy from the deforming system at whatever rate needed in order to keep @xmath10 fixed , effectively using an unrealistic thermal diffusion coefficient .",
    "another manifestation of the same problem can be seen in fig .",
    "[ c_s ] where the stress can reach values more than an order of magnitude larger than the yield @xmath55 .",
    "this observation may question the relevance of the high rates of deformation part of the hl data to understanding plasticity of real materials .",
    "however , even if we neglect the very high rates of deformation ( and very high stresses ) part of the hl data , the remaining part still provides an excellent test for the ideas presented in this work and can be used to isolate novel and important physical aspects of plasticity of amorphous systems .",
    "the novel non - monotonic transient effects , which are supported by the available experimental results of @xcite is one of them .",
    "it is important to stress that the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath0 during transients might be very important for understanding strain localization . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that shear banding initiation takes place only during transients , while the steady states are linearly stable .",
    "however , the authors of @xcite used an equation for @xmath0 that precludes a non - monotonic behavior and a strain rate dependent @xmath59 . redoing the calculation with the @xmath0 dynamics proposed in this work , i.e. eq .",
    "( [ heat1 ] ) , might shed some new light on this important phenomenon .",
    "moreover , using eq .",
    "( [ heat1 ] ) the authors of @xcite found a linear instability in which an expanding circular cavity becomes unstable against the formation of crack - like localized fingers , a result that might be relevant for understanding `` brittle '' versus `` ductile '' behaviors .",
    "this clean linear instability was not found for a @xmath0 equation that allows only for a monotonic approach to steady state and see also @xcite for details .",
    "in this work an attempt to formulate and rationalize an equation of motion for an effective disorder temperature @xmath0 was made , building on earlier ideas of langer @xcite .",
    "the resulting equation , coupled to the predictions of the stz theory @xcite , suggests a compact deformation theory for athermal amorphous systems .",
    "one of the results obtained is that this theoretical structure is consistent with the steady state simulations of @xcite , for low temperatures .",
    "however , the functions @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ teff_dot1 ] ) and @xmath88 in eq .",
    "( [ fstz ] ) were not derived from first principles , but were extracted from the numerical data instead . understanding how to derive these functions from a more fundamental point of view is a major challenge . the present work focused on athermal conditions ; understanding how to treat theoretically the contributions of ordinary thermal fluctuations and the interaction of the deforming system with the heat bath for higher temperatures @xmath10 is yet another challenge .",
    "some steps in this direction were made in @xcite .",
    "several recent works proposed alternative @xmath0 dynamics . we have already mentioned that an equation very similar to the one proposed here was suggested in @xcite . moreover , the equations used in @xcite are fully consistent with the general structure of eq .",
    "( [ teff_dot1 ] ) , but with @xmath143 instead of our eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) . here",
    "@xmath144 is the function plotted in fig .",
    "in fact , in @xcite it was shown that this choice is consistent with the very same hl data analyzed here , implying that neither the choice of eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) nor that of eq .",
    "( [ gjim ] ) is unique .",
    "however , our transient dynamics analysis provides a way to distinguish between the two approaches .",
    "( [ gjim ] ) immediately implies that @xmath0 reaches its steady state value monotonically , whereas we have demonstrated explicitly that eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) may lead to non - monotonic transients that were observed experimentally in @xcite .",
    "this difference , as explained above , may be very important for understanding strain localization that was shown to occur during transients @xcite .",
    "more importantly , there is a fundamental difference between the two approaches . when using eq .",
    "( [ gjim ] ) , the function @xmath144 is an _ input _ to the theory and is not calculated within the theory . however , in our approach , using eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) , @xmath144 is determined by the theory once @xmath88 is known , making the stress dependent rate function @xmath88 a fundamental quantity . therefore , we still have to understand whether the function @xmath144 is a fundamental and general quantity , depending only on @xmath84 , but not on the details of the rearrangements , as was claimed in @xcite ; or that the stress dependent rate function @xmath88 that captures much of the microscopic physics of the irreversible rearrangements is more fundamental , as implied by our approach .",
    "the present work provides further support for the role of the concept of an effective disorder temperature in understanding the irreversible deformation of amorphous systems . in light of these results ,",
    "based heavily on computer molecular dynamics simulations , one must ask how these ideas are to be tested in laboratory experiments .",
    "this raises the question of how to measure @xmath0 in real experiments .",
    "in fact , a beautiful example for such a laboratory measurement was give in @xcite where the mobility and self - diffusion of tracer particles within a dense granular flow were used to evaluate @xmath0 through an einstein relation .",
    "this measurement is directly related to the work presented here since in @xcite it was shown explicitly that such an einstein relation between the self - diffusion coefficient and the mobility coefficient yields a @xmath0 that is consistent with our definition of @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( [ teff_der ] ) .",
    "other possibilities for laboratory measurements of @xmath0 include coupling the system to a low - frequency harmonic oscillator and measuring its fluctuations @xcite or measuring the barrier crossing rate of a two - level system weakly coupled to the system of interest , as demonstrated recently in a simulation @xcite .    an entirely different and new possibility for measuring @xmath0 is related to the quasi - thermodynamic role of @xmath0 , as stressed in @xcite . in these works",
    "@xmath0 was used as a state variable in equations of state for different physical quantities .",
    "for example , in @xcite an equation of state relating the mass density @xmath145 to @xmath0 was proposed for simulated amorphous silicon .",
    "once such equations of state become theoretically available one can obtain simple `` @xmath0-thermometers '' by measuring standard macroscopic quantities as a function of the deformation and relating them to @xmath0 through the equation of state @xcite .",
    "an indication for this possibility was given recently in @xcite where the shear modulus @xmath116 was shown to be a function of the rate of deformation .",
    "this quantity can be in principle related to @xmath146 once an equation of state of the form @xmath147 is known .",
