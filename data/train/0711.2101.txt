    "many numerical simulations of gas motion in the bar potential show that bars can accumulate gas toward the central region ( e.g. , athanassoula 1992 ) .",
    "observational evidence of gas accumulation toward the central kilo - parsec region has also been shown .",
    "for example , sakamato et al . ( 1999 ) and sheth et al .",
    "( 2005 ) showed that barred spiral galaxies have higher central concentration of molecular gas than non - barred spiral galaxies .",
    "furthermore , kuno et al . ( 2007 ) showed that the higher central concentration in barred spirals is made by gas accumulation within a region on the order of the bar length and found a correlation between bar strength and the degree of central concentration .    on the other hand , observations of molecular gas with high angular resolution sufficient to resolve",
    "the central structure less than 100 pc are still limited ( e.g. , schinnerer et al .",
    "2003 ; garca - burillo et al .",
    "such observations are necessary to understand how the gas flows into the nucleus and relates with central activities .",
    "for example , the size of the twin peaks often seen in the central region of barred galaxies is less than several hundred pc ( kenney et al .",
    "therefore , we need such high angular resolution to investigate the distribution and dynamics of molecular gas in the central region .",
    "maffei 2 is a barred spiral galaxy that belongs to the ic 342/maffei group .",
    "since maffei 2 is located behind the galactic plane , its optical features are not clear .",
    "however , the bar and spiral structures can be seen clearly in a near infrared image ( jarrett et al . 2003 ) .",
    "many co observations have so far been done ( ishiguro et al . 1989 ; kawabe et al .",

    "the co map obtained with the nobeyama 45-m telescope shows structures typical of the distribution of molecular gas in barred spiral galaxies ; central peak , offset ridges along the leading side of the large - scale bar , condensations of molecular gas at the end of the bar , and spiral arms from the end of the bar .",
    "they are symmetric against the center .",
    "the motion of molecular gas in the bar is also consistent with that seen in barred spiral galaxies .",
    "namely , the large velocity change is seen across the bar implying that the gas moves along the offset ridges toward the center .",
    "since maffei 2 is one of the nearest barred spiral galaxies , we can investigate the distribution and dynamics of molecular gas in the center and the bar in detail .",
    "furthermore , since maffei 2 has a moderate starburst at the center as suggested from ir and radio observations ( rickard , harvey 1984 ; turner , ho 1994 ) , observations of maffei 2 with high angular resolution are helpful to understand the mechanism of the gas fueling toward the galactic center by bars and relation with a starburst phenomenon in barred spiral galaxies .    in this paper , we present the results of @xmath0co(10 ) , @xmath0co(21 ) , cs(21 ) lines and 103 ghz continuum observations of maffei 2 with the nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) .",

    "although the @xmath0co(10 ) map is consistent with the previous map ( ishiguro et al . 1989 ; kawabe et al .",

    "the width of the ridge ( fwhm ) deconvolved with the beam size is @xmath22 which corresponds to 50 pc at the distance of maffei2 .",

    "since the inclination angle of maffei 2 is fairly large ( @xmath27 : hurt et al .",
    "1996 ) , some structures overlap along the line of sight . such structures mixed in the peaks can be separated in the velocity domain , as shown in section 3.2 .    the distribution of @xmath0co(21 ) emission is consistent with that of @xmath0co(10 ) emission .",
    "the curve of the ridges at the peaks is more apparent in @xmath0co(21 ) , especially in the southern ridge .",
    "although the size of the peaks is about the same as that in @xmath0co(10 ) , they are closer to the center . in both lines ,",
    "the emissions are weak at the center .    assuming a conversion factor from co(1  0 ) intensity to column density of h@xmath28 @xmath29h@xmath30 of @xmath31 @xmath32 [ k km s@xmath8]@xmath8 ( nakai , kuno 1995 ) , the molecular gas mass within the field of view ( @xmath34 pc ) is estimated to be about @xmath35 .",
    "this is smaller than the values reported in the previous observations ( e.g. , ishiguro et al . 1989 ) because of the difference in the adopted distance and the conversion factor .",

    "the peak flux of @xmath0co(10 ) is 47.3 jy beam@xmath8 km s@xmath8 which corresponds to the column density of @xmath36 @xmath32 or the surface density of about 2700 @xmath37 pc@xmath38 .",
    "since the width of the ridges ( fwhm ) in the map is about 50 pc , the thickness must be smaller than that .",
    "if we assume that the thickness and inclination angle of the gas disk are 50 pc and 67 deg , respectively , a lower limit of the average volume density within the beam is derived to be @xmath39 @xmath7 .",

    "we will discuss the physical properties of molecular gas including observations of other lines in a forthcoming paper .",
    "figure 3 shows the integrated intensity map of cs(21 ) .",
    "the cs map also show twin peaks .",
    "the peaks coincide with the co peaks .",
    "the northern peak is much stronger than the southern side .",

    "the 3 mm continuum is thought to trace star - forming regions , since it is dominated by free - free emission ( condon 1992 ) .",
    "actually , these structures coincide with those in other tracers of star - forming activity , such as the 2 cm and 6 cm continua ( turner , ho 1994 ) , 10.8 @xmath46 m ( telesco et al . 1993 ) . however , the correlation with h@xmath47 is not good .",
    "the h@xmath47 peak in ishiguro et al .",
    "( 1989 ) is located about @xmath48 north of the 103 ghz peak .",
    "the reason for the bad correlation between free - free emission and h@xmath47 is thought to be dust extinction in h@xmath47 .",
    "a similar trend is seen in m82 ( matsushita et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the total flux density of the 3 mm continuum is 38 mjy .",
    "the peak flux density within the @xmath15 beam is about @xmath49 of the total flux density .",
    "therefore , most of the emission is concentrated in the peak .",
    "we estimate the production rates of lyman continuum photons , @xmath50 , using the flux according to condon ( 1992 ) .",
    "the result derived from the total flux density is @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are electron temperature and distance , respectively .",
    "this is about two times larger than that derived from the 6 cm continuum ( turner , ho 1994 ) after correcting the difference of the adopted distance .",
    "as compared with the starburst galaxy m82 , the derived @xmath50 of maffei 2 is comparable with that of an individual peak in m82 measured with the @xmath54 beam ( matsushita et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the massive star formation rate ( @xmath55 ) derived from the production rate of lyman continuum photons using the equation ( 24 ) in condon ( 1992 ) is @xmath56 . on the other hand ,",
    "the star formation rate derived from the infrared luminosity of @xmath57 ( rickard , harvey 1984 ) using the equation ( 26 ) in condon ( 1992 ) is @xmath56 , if the distance we adopted is used .",
    "they show good agreement .",
    "figures 5 and 6 are the channel maps of @xmath0co(10 ) and @xmath0co(21 ) .",
    "they show quite similar features . near the systemic velocity of maffei 2 ( -24 km",
    "s@xmath8 : kuno et al .",
    "2007 ) , two peaks are seen north and south of the center , shown by a cross in the figures . for a circular motion , the emission should be observed near the minor axis at systemic velocity .",
    "the peaks , however , are located near the major axis , indicating large non - circular motion .",
    "the peaks move toward the north with decreasing radial velocity keeping the separation of the peaks almost constant . on the other hand , they move toward the south with increasing radial velocity .",
    "position - velocity diagrams are helpful to understand the complex velocity structure in maffei 2 .",

    "= @xmath58 : hurt et al .",
    "it is apparent that the central structure is separated into two parallel components in the p  v diagrams ( b - c - d , b-c-d ) .",

    "the radial velocities at the center of both components are not systemic velocity of maffei 2 ( -24 km s@xmath8 ) .",
    "there is no emission at systemic velocity at the center .",
    "the parallel components are clearly separated in the p ",
    "v diagram along the minor axis as shown in figure 8 .",

    "for the northern component ( upper side ) in figure 7(c ) , a ",
    "b corresponds to the offset ridges of the large - scale bar ( a  b in figure 7(a ) for the southern component ) .",
    "if we assume that the spiral arms of maffie 2 are trailing arm , the eastern side against the major axis of the galaxy is far side and the large - scale bar approaches us closing to the center for the northern side of the galaxy ( figure 1 ) . therefore , if the gas moves along the large - scale bar , the observed blue - shift of the radial velocities from the systemic velocity means inward motion .",
    "the offset ridge connects to the parallel structure at b ( b for the southern component ) .",
    "the radial velocity along the parallel structure changes from blue - shift to red - shift before the structure crosses the minor axis ( b  c ) , although the point should be on the minor axis for a circular motion .",
    "the same feature but in the opposite sense can be seen for the southern component .",
    "furthermore , the parallel components are connected by a weak oval structure , as indicated in figure 7b .",
    "there are bifurcations in the oval structure at c and c. the radial velocity increases closing to the center from the points to d and d.",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the p  v diagrams along the major axis ( figure 7 ) shows two components almost overlapping along the line of sight .",
    "these structures can be regarded as a spiral structure embedded in a weak oval structure .",
    "we made integrated intensity maps of each component of the parallel structure in figure 7 separately using the channel map .",
    "figure 9 shows the integrated intensity map overlaid on the hst image ( f814w ) obtained from the hst archive .",
    "they look like the two - arm spiral structure continues from the offset ridges along the large - scale bar in the co map obtained with the nro 45-m telescope .",
    "the structure can be seen in both @xmath0co(10 ) and @xmath0co(21 ) .",
    "the spiral structure is symmetric against the center determined from the 2mass data .",
    "the northern arm coincides with the dust lane in the hst image very well near the center , while the dust lane along the southern arm is not clear .",
    "this is because the northern arm is on the near side ( western side against the major axis of the galaxy ) near the center .",
    "it is apparent that the oval structure in figure 7b is not an expanding ring .",
    "the part of the oval structure that overlaps with the northern arm is on the near side near the center , as mentioned above .",
    "the radial velocity of the part is red - shift from the systemic velocity of maffei 2 ( around c in figure 7c ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the ring is shrinking , the velocity toward the center must be higher than 50 km s@xmath8 . in that case , the oval structure collapses into the nucleus in less than @xmath59 yr .",
    "this seems to be unlikely .",
    "the oval structure can be naturally understood as an oval motion of molecular gas .",
    "the oval structure connects the spiral structure .",
    "the schematic figure of the spiral and oval structures is shown in figure 10 . here , we assume inclination and position angle derived for the galactic disk",
    ". similar structures with the offset ridges and oval structure are often seen in numerical simulations ( e.g. , athanassoula 1992 ) .",
    "these structures are made from @xmath11 and @xmath12 orbits in a bar potential .",
    "similar structure has been found in ngc 4303 ( schinnerer et al .",
    "2002 ; koda , sofue 2006 ) .",
    "the complex p  v diagrams can be understood with our interpretation .",
    "the offset ridges along the large - scale bar contact with the x2 orbit at b and b in figure 7 .",
    "the constant gradient of the radial velocity b ",
    "c and b  c in figure 7 is attributed to the flow of the molecular gas along the spiral arms around the center .",
    "the spiral arms diverge from the oval structure toward the center .",
    "this corresponds to c  d and c  d in the p  v diagrams .",
    "the deviation from the systemic velocity becomes max there , since the gas stream line closes to the line of sight .",
    "the sizes of the structure shown in figure 10 were derived from the p  v diagrams along the major and minor axes and the channel map as follows : ( 1 ) the separation along the major axis between the spiral arms derived from figure 7(b ) ( @xmath25 pc ) .",
    "( 2 ) the separation along the minor axis between the spiral arms derived from figure 8 ( @xmath60 pc ) . ( 3 ) the separation along the major axis direction between the positions where radial velocity equals to the systemic velocity .",

    "( 2003a ; 2003b ) show from hst images that galaxies with strong bars often have a grand - design nuclear dust spiral structure , which appears to be the continuation of the dust lanes along the leading edges of a large - scale bar toward the center .",
    "on the other hand , observations of such spiral structures of molecular gas are still rare .",
    "the distribution of molecular gas in maffei 2 can be regarded as such a spiral structure . although maffei 2 is classified as sab(rs ) in rc3",
    ", it seems to be due to the unclear optical image . according to buta and block ( 2001 ) , maffei 2",
    "should be classified as sb(rs ) .",
    "therefore , our result is consistent with martini(2004 ) s finding that grand - design spiral structure is only found in sb(s ) or sb(rs ) .",

    "it is desirable to obtain the inner rotation curve with higher spatial resolution and higher sensitivity observations to know the mass distribution in the inner region .",
    "the molecular gas changes the direction of motion with a large velocity change when it enters the offset ridge along the large - scale bar .",
    "then , the gas flows toward the center along the offset ridge .",
    "since the radial velocity is almost constant along the straight ridges , as seen in figure 7 , the streaming velocity along the ridge seems to be constant .",
    "( the component of the pattern speed of the bar is relatively small as compared with the velocity along the bar . )",

    "the size of the co peak is more than hundreds pc , while the condensations in maffei 2 are comparable to the galactic gmcs . therefore , the molecular clouds should be treated as particles in ngc 6951 . in that case , since the viscosity of the gas is small , shock may not play an important role in dense gas formation at the @xmath11/@xmath12 orbit - crowding region , while the gravitational instability does . on the other hand ,",
    "the clump of molecular gas whose size is comparable with a gmc is compressed at the crossing point in maffei 2 . as a result , strong shock may occur and dense gas is formed at a burst there .",
    "we made @xmath0co(10 ) , @xmath0co(21 ) , cs(21 ) lines and 103 ghz continuum observations of maffei 2 . using the data set , we investigated the distribution and kinematics of molecular gas in the central region .",
    "the results are summarized as follows : + ( 1 ) we revealed the spiral structure of molecular gas in the central region .",
    "the offset ridges of molecular gas along the leading side of the large - scale bar continue to the spiral structure embedded in the weak oval structure which is regarded as a x2 orbit .",
    "the size of these structures is less than @xmath3 100 pc .",
    "the spiral structure continues toward the center at least until @xmath3 35 pc diverging from the oval structure .",
    "+ ( 2 ) the central mass within @xmath3 35 pc is estimated to be @xmath4 from the rotation curve , which corresponds to 0.5 % of the dynamical mass of maffei 2 .",
    "the percentage is consistent with the theoretical predictions to make such a spiral structure of molecular gas .",
    "+ ( 3 ) the amount of the molecular gas which flows along the offset ridges of the large - scale bar is estimated to be 712 @xmath66 .",
    "this is an upper limit of the mass flow of molecular gas into the nucleus .",
    "+ ( 4 ) our results imply that dense gas is formed at the crossing points of @xmath11 and @xmath12 orbits .",
