    "asymptotically flat electrovac black holes in four spacetime dimensions are remarkably simple objects .",
    "they are comprised in the kerr - newman ( kn ) family , and uniquely characterized by their global charges : the mass , the angular momentum and the electromagnetic charges @xcite .",
    "their simplicity and beauty led to the conjecture , that the properties of this electrovac family of black holes were generic properties of black holes and that the theorems holding for them should remain true in the presence of other fields , as well .",
    "in particular , black holes should not carry hair and thus not possess any special features beyond those that would be fully determined by their global charges .    towards the end of the last century ,",
    "the consideration of non - abelian fields coupled to einstein gravity had a major impact on our understanding of the properties of black holes in four dimensions .",
    "the first hairy black holes constructed at the time were black holes with a particular set of non - abelian scalar fields , i.e. , black holes carrying skyrme hair @xcite .",
    "these static hairy black holes emerge from gravitating skyrmion solutions , when the presence of a small horizon is imposed in the interior of the solitonic configurations . however , the horizon size of these hairy black holes is bounded from above .",
    "so large static black holes in einstein - skyrme theory can only be schwarzschild black holes .",
    "soon thereafter , the discovery of the globally regular bartnik - mckinnon solutions @xcite in su(2 ) einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) theory led to the quest for black holes with yang - mills hair @xcite .",
    "the resulting static spherically symmetric eym black holes possess a purely magnetic gauge field and a single global charge , their mass . for a given horizon radius",
    "there is an infinite number of black holes , all differing in their metric and field configurations .",
    "in particular , these black holes can be labelled by an integer @xmath0 , counting the number of nodes of the single gauge field function .",
    "obviously , the global charges no longer determine these non - abelian black holes uniquely . while there is",
    "no limit on the mass and the size of these black holes , with increasing integer @xmath0 these magnetically neutral solutions tend towards some limiting configuration , which in its outer part corresponds to an extremal reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) black hole with unit magnetic charge @xcite .",
    "however , besides their infinite non - uniqueness , these eym black holes held further surprizes . for electrovac black holes israel s theorem states that static black holes are spherically symmetric @xcite . in eym",
    "theory this is no longer true . indeed ,",
    "static eym black holes exist , which possess only axial symmetry @xcite .",
    "when the circumference of the horizon is measured along the poles and compared to the circumference measured along the equator , their ratio differs from one .",
    "such deformed static black holes can be obtained by including a winding number @xmath1 w.r.t .  the azimuthal angle , leading to prolate horizon shapes .",
    "by including an integer w.r.t .",
    "the polar angle , one obtains a further type of static eym black holes @xcite .",
    "all these configurations can be interpreted as bound states of black holes and solitonic configurations @xcite .    in this review",
    "we will first focus on rotating eym black hole solutions @xcite ( for a review on the static case see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "these black holes represent generalizations of the kn solutions , since they carry mass , angular momentum and a small electric charge , which is induced by the rotation @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note , that whereas the static axially symmetric eym black holes possess globally regular counterparts @xcite , the rotating eym black holes do not @xcite .",
    "when trying to obtain such solitonic rotating configurations with a regular center the fall - off conditions at spatial infinity can not be met when only massless fields are present .",
    "the eym black holes can be generalized by including a dilaton field . in its presence",
    "a smarr type mass formula holds @xcite .",
    "moreover , such rotating einstein - yang - mills - dilaton ( eymd ) black holes need not carry an electric charge in the presence of rotation @xcite .",
    "subsequently , we will discuss the solutions obtained by including a higgs field , giving mass to ( some of ) the gauge fields . in the case of a higgs triplet ,",
    "gravitating monopole solutions @xcite , monopole - antimonopole pairs and systems arise @xcite , which can be endowed with a black hole at their center @xcite .",
    "while all of these black holes can be put into rotation , by giving their horizon a finite angular velocity @xcite , only the globally regular solutions without a global magnetic charge can carry angular momentum @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the rotating hairy black holes bifurcate with kn black holes .",
    "thus kn black holes are unstable w.r.t .  growing yang - mills - higgs ( ymh ) hair . in the presence of a dilaton",
    "again a smarr type mass formula holds @xcite .    from a physical point of view the einstein - yang - mills - higgs ( eymh ) black holes with a higgs triplet",
    "might be relevant in the early universe around a grand unified theory ( gut ) phase transition , since a ymh theory with a higgs triplet may be embedded in relevant guts .",
    "later , during the electroweak phase transition , the standard model ( sm ) gauge and higgs fields play a prominent role . here",
    "a complex doublet of higgs fields is needed to give the electroweak vector bosons mass , while the photon remains massless .",
    "the globally regular solutions of this theory are electroweak sphalerons and their generalizations @xcite .",
    "coupling them to einstein gravity and endowing them with a black hole at their center , leads again to bound states of static black holes and globally regular solutions @xcite .",
    "we will address their rotating generalizations towards the end of this review @xcite .    whereas all of these rotating hairy black hole solutions involve non - abelian fields , recently also rotating hair black holes of a different kind were found @xcite .",
    "these are based on the presence of a single complex scalar field and thus a u(1 ) invariance of the theory . unlike the non - abelian black holes addressed in this review , they possess no non - rotating limit .",
    "but they may be interpreted as bound states of black holes and solitons , as well , representing black holes inside rotating boson stars .",
    "many of their properties have been studied by now in detail including their ergosurfaces , their shadows or their iron - k@xmath2 lines @xcite .",
    "the explicit time - dependence of the complex scalar field seems to make them generically different from the eym and eymh black holes .",
    "however , for the latter an analogous time - dependence signalling a rotation in internal space will arise in a different gauge , when the black holes carry electric charge . likewise ,",
    "if one were to rotate black holes with skyrmion hair , the scalar field would need an explicit time dependence @xcite .",
    "note also the recent review article on black holes with scalar hair @xcite .    in section 2 of this",
    "review rotating black holes with ym and ym dilaton ( ymd ) hair are addressed . in section 3 a higgs triplet is included , and the new features of the resulting rotating black holes are discussed . for a higgs doublet only static black holes have been studied so far .",
    "we conclude in section 4 .",
    "here we present the current status of asymptotically flat rotating einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) and einstein - yang - mills - dilaton ( eymd ) black holes . starting with the action and field equations for the general case",
    ", we then address the physical properties and exhibit a number of interesting results for these rotating non - abelian black holes , first for the case of eym black holes obtained for vanishing dilaton coupling constant @xmath3 , and subsequently for eymd black holes with arbitrary @xmath3 .",

    "in hindsight , this former belief seems surprizing , since many localized finite energy solutions were known in these theories , solitons and sphalerons , which can be coupled with gravity and endowed with a small black hole in their interior .",
    "arguments for the existence of such black holes within monopoles or sphalerons could have been put forward long ago .",
    "merely the existence of regular solutions without a flat spacetime limit , such as the bm solutions of pure eym theory , and their associated black holes was less straightforward to anticipate .",

    "in contrast , in eymd theory , the presence of the dilaton allows for solutions of the second type , which possess a finite angular momentum and vanishing non - abelian charge .",
    "the third type of solutions , which should possess a vanishing angular momentum while being non - static , does not seem to exist in eymd theory , either .",
    "many features of these rotating eym and eymd black holes are analogous to those of their static counterparts . for instance , there is no upper bound for the size of these black holes , and the sequences of radially excited rotating black holes tend ( in their outer region ) to embedded abelian black holes .",
    "moreover , these rotating non - abelian black holes should inherit the instabilities of their static counterparts .",
    "interestingly , in eymd theory a smarr - type mass formula holds for these non - abelian rotating black holes , since the dilaton term can comprise the mass contribution originating from the magnetic fields , when a magnetic charge itself is missing .",
    "the presence of a higgs field has a number of significant consequences for the existence and the properties of the black holes @xcite .",
    "first of all , the horizon size of eymh black holes is bounded from above . considering these configurations as black holes within solitons , i.e. , black holes within regular solutions with a localized finite energy density , the finite of extent of these solitons seems to limit the size of the black holes they can contain .",
    "this observation looks rather general , holding not only for eymh theory with triple and with doublet higgs fields , but also for theories with other types of matter fields , like einstein - skyrme theory .    in the case of a triplet higgs ,",
    "the eymh black holes carry electromagnetic charge(s ) .",
    "but unlike eym theory , rotation induces only a dipole moment and not an electric charge of the black holes .",
    "in order to have electrically charged black holes one has to choose a particular boundary condition for the electric component of the gauge field .",
    "this involves a parameter @xmath187 , which can be interpreted as describing a rotational frequency in internal space .",
    "interestingly , this parameter enters the smarr - like mass formula for these non - abelian black holes ( which can be obtained , when a dilaton is included ) .",
    "formally this term in the mass formula has a counterpart in the mass formula of rotating black holes within boson stars .",
    "the presence of the embedded rn and kn black holes allows the branches of genuinely non - abelian black holes to merge and end in such embedded abelian black holes .",
    "clearly , this signals the presence of an instability of the abelian black holes .",
    "indeed , rn and kn black holes in eymh theory become unstable in a certain parameter region with respect to developing non - abelian hair .",
    "when genuine non - abelian black holes can no longer exist , only embedded abelian black holes remain .    in principle , a plethora of static and rotating black hole configurations is possible in these non - abelian theories .",
    "stationary axially symmetric configurations can be characterized by three integers , @xmath1 , @xmath49 and @xmath0 .",
    "while @xmath0 labels the radial excitations , @xmath49 denotes the number of ` components ' of composite solutions , e.g. , a monopole - antimonopole pair has @xmath188 , and @xmath1 represents the magnetic charge of the components .",
    "all regular configurations can be endowed with a black hole at their center , and all static black holes can be set into rotation .",
    "an interesting open question here is , whether in eymh theory also genuinely non - abelian systems of rotating black holes can exist , which are completely regular outside their horizons .",
    "while einstein - maxwell theory does not allow for systems of rotating solutions ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) , the presence of non - abelian fields might result in a balance of forces and thus regularity .",
    "finding such solutions would be another highlight and important example , showing once again that established abelian theorems can not be extended to the non - abelian case .",
    "last but not least let us briefly address the generalization of such non - abelian solutions in the presence of a cosmological constant , yielding anti - de sitter ( ads ) or de sitter ( ds ) black holes .",
    "eym solutions in asymptotically ads space exhibit new interesting features . in particular , they need a further parameter for their characterization , and there are stable spherically symmetric black hole solutions , not present in asymptotically flat space @xcite .",
    "topological eym black holes which possess a nonspherical event horizon topology were also shown to exist in eym theory with a negative cosmological constant @xcite . while static ads eym black holes with axial symmetry only",
    "have been obtained recently @xcite , rotating generalizations of ads eym black holes are still missing . only globally",
    "regular rotating configurations have been obtained so far @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of a positive cosmological constant leads to black hole solutions which possess a cosmological horizon .",
    "however , static spherically symmetric ds eym solutions were shown to be unstable @xcite .",
    "( see the review @xcite for further details on ads and ds eym black holes . )",
