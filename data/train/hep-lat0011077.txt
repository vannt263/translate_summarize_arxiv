    "many interesting problems in non - equilibrium field theory are non - perturbative .",
    "one could hope that they can be put on a lattice and then be solved by a computer .",
    "however , lattice simulations of quantum field theory ( qft ) work in euclidean time and nobody knows how to perform real time simulations .",
    "a considerable simplification occurs for systems which are in partial ( or incomplete ) equilibrium ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it means that some slowly relaxing quantities @xmath0 differ significantly from their equilibrium values , while all other degrees of freedom are thermalized .",
    "the most extreme example are hydrodynamic modes , their relaxation times diverge when their wavelengths go to infinity ( other examples will be discussed in sec .  [",

    "the non - equilibrium problem can then be reduced to evolution equations for the @xmath0 .",
    "these equations contain so called transport coefficients , and the task of non - equilibrium field theory is to determine them from the underlying qft .",

    "i have already mentioned that a serious difficulty of thermal field theory is the fact that one has to deal with real time .",

    "a well known special case of the classical field approximation ( usually not referred to as such ) is the dimensional reduction of a @xmath10 dimensional thermal qft in the imaginary time formalism to the @xmath11 dimensional theory for the zero matsubara frequency modes of the bosonic fields @xcite .",
    "this is the formal classical limit because for @xmath12 the non - zero modes become infinitely heavy and decouple .",
    "the thermodynamics of qft can be studied with 4-dimensional lattice simulations , which is the only reliable way to access the properties of hot qcd near the critical temperature .",
    "dimensional reduction is convenient for very high temperatures when there is a large separation of the scale @xmath13 and the screening length(s ) of the system . in non - equilibrium field theory",
    "the role of the classical field approximation is much more important since there is no tractable analogue of the 4-dimensional euclidean theory",

    "the lattice system thermalizes , but the improved hartree approximation fails to reproduce this behaviour @xcite .      starting from a high temperature , a first order phase transition proceeds through the nucleation of droplets , which then grow and eventually fill the whole space with the low temperature phase .",

    "most calculations of the nucleation rate use the formalism due to langer @xcite which is based on a saddle point approximation around the the critical droplet .",

    "the best agreement was found when the 2-loop effective potential for the higgs field @xcite together with the field dependent wave function renormalization @xcite is used .",
    "[ sc : hartree ] the classical field approximation is clearly restrictive , and it is not capable of treating genuine quantum effects . for example , the thermalization of the universe after preheating ( cf.sec .  [",

    "it is sometimes possible to obtain effective classical theories when the non - classical modes are weakly interacting and can be integrated out in perturbation theory ( see sec .  [",

    "the hartree approximation was discussed in the talk by j.  vink @xcite and there are several related approaches .",
    "usually the basic idea is to work directly with non - equilibrium green functions or , alternatively , with the generating functional of 1-pi green functions @xcite .",

    "it is possible to formulate such truncations as a systematic expansion in @xmath18 , where @xmath9 is the number of some fields @xcite .",

    "[ sc : close ] as i mentioned in the introduction , there are interesting non - equilibrium processes in which most of the degrees of freedom are equilibrated and only some slowly relaxing ones are not . the task of non - equilibrium field theory is then to determine the relevant diffusion coefficients .    in weakly coupled theories it is possible to compute some transport coefficients using perturbation theory .",
    "this is not an easy task .",
    "typically one has to sum an infinite set of diagrams , which was done for the shear and bulk viscosity in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional scalar theory with cubic and quartic self interactions @xcite .",
    "the result of @xcite is equivalent to the solution of the classical boltzmann equation with appropriate coefficients .",
    "other transport coefficients were calculated starting directly from the boltzmann equation , which is technically much simpler than a diagrammatic analysis @xcite .",
    "another application of the boltzmann equation of current interest is the generation of a lepton asymmetry due to heavy majorana neutrinos @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it is not clear whether the classical boltzmann equation is the leading order effective theory in some systematic weak coupling expansion which would allow to go beyond the leading order .",
    "there are problems where this is necessary , like for example in electroweak baryogenesis @xcite .",
    "there are transport coefficients which are not computable in ( appropriately resummed ) perturbation theory even when the coupling constant is small .",
    "a famous example is the rate @xmath20 for baryon ( @xmath21 ) plus lepton number ( @xmath22 ) dissipation in the standard electroweak theory @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian of the electroweak theory has a u(1 ) symmetry which would imply that @xmath23 is conserved .",

    "it then gets washed out according to @xmath25    there is a fluctuation dissipation relation stating that @xmath26 is proportional to the chern - simons diffusion rate @xmath27 of the weak su(2 ) gauge fields .",
    "@xmath28 is dominated by soft gauge field modes with typical momenta of order @xmath29 .",
    "this is the so called magnetic screening scale at which perturbation theory for hot yang - mills theory breaks down @xcite .",

    "the occupation number of the bosonic field modes can be estimated from the bose - einstein distribution function @xmath30 which is of order @xmath31 for the soft ( @xmath32 ) modes .",
    "the question how to calculate @xmath28 has a long history .",
    "one reason for this long lasting interest is that the @xmath23 dissipation rate is a fundamental quantity of the standard model of electroweak interactions ( sm ) and extensions thereof .",
    "it plays an important role in particle physics scenarios for generating the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "the use of classical lattice field theory for calculating @xmath28 was first suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional model was studied .",
    "originally it was assumed that the naive classical field approximation correctly describes the dynamics of the soft modes in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional yang - mills theory .",

    "it is suggestive because it is true for the thermodynamics of hot yang - mills fields : at leading order in @xmath39 the soft non - perturbative modes are described by the 3-dimensional pure yang  mills theory of dimensional reduction , and the only role of high momentum modes is to make the coupling constant equal to its renormalized value .

    "they are particularly ugly , they are non - local in space and time and on the lattice they are sensitive to the lattice geometry ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the occurrence of such divergences in lattice field theory is possible due to the lack of lorentz invariance which is explicitly broken by the presence of the thermal bath . as a consequence ,",
    "green functions with external momenta @xmath43 depend not only on the lorentz invariants @xmath44 but on frequencies and spatial momenta separately .",
    "gluonloop    ( 60,60 )    @xmath45    ( 60,60 )    @xmath45    ( 60,60 )    since such divergences are probably not familiar to most of the audience , let me describe them in some more detail .",
    "they are due to the one - loop polarization tensor ( see fig .  2 ) .",
