    "quantum corrections can qualitatively change the analytic structure of the green function or the symmetry properties of a classical field - theoretical system .",
    "qualitatively new features compared to the tree level picture may emerge already at finite orders of perturbation theory for green functions while some effects can only appear as a result of summing up an infinite number of perturbative terms .",
    "an effect of non - conservation of the abelian axial current reveals itself at leading order as a result of the calculation of an one - loop triangle diagram  @xcite while spontaneous symmetry breaking or bound state formation can not be observed at any finite order of perturbation theory and requires an infinite summation of relevant subsets of diagrams . for problems related to an investigation of the symmetry properties of quantum systems ,",
    "such an infinite summation can be readily done by introducing an effective action for the system and calculating it as a loop expansion series .",
    "such an approach reorders the perturbation series with respect to the lines of diagrams related to external fields and allows one to take into account the entire dependence on external fields exactly within a given order of the loop expansion .",
    "an effective action can be considered as a generating functional for the vertex ( one - particle irreducible , or proper ) green functions ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "the treatment of external fields beyond finite order of expansion was done in ref .",
    "the efficient method of calculating the effective action is based on the legendre transform of the generating functional for connected green functions and heavily uses the functional techniques  @xcite .",
    "one can also use a practical calculation technique by substituting the shifted fields in the original lagrangian of the system  @xcite . the part of the effective action which is constructed from the constant field is usually called an effective potential and is used to analyze the fundamental symmetry properties of the theory beyond the plain perturbation theory where the effect of the external fields is resummed to all orders .",
    "the expansion leading to the effective potential is , in fact , an expansion in planck s constant @xmath5 , i.e.  the correction accounts for the deflection from the classical limit .",
    "therefore new effects which are absent in the classical approximation may appear within such an approach .",
    "an example for this kind of new quantum effects is the light - by - light scattering which emerges as a quantum correction to the photon dynamics due to the interaction with virtual electrons . in the low - energy limit",
    "it can be seen as a nonlinearity of the equations for the strong electromagnetic fields in the vacuum .",
    "the behaviour of the electromagnetic fields with such a correction can be described by the euler - heisenberg lagrangian  @xcite .",
    "the generalization to non - abelian fields is discussed in ref .",
    "the effective potential is also a powerful tool for investigating effects of spontaneous symmetry breaking by quantum corrections  @xcite and for analyzing the properties of particle systems at finite temperature and density  @xcite .",
    "a special advantage of using the external field technique in gauge theories is an explicit gauge invariance of the effective action that allows to drastically simplify the computation and to reduce the number of necessary diagrams  @xcite .",
    "it is generally believed that in non - abelian gauge theories the nonperturbative fluctuations ( instantons )  @xcite create a complex vacuum structure that eventually explain ( or is responsible for ) the low - energy observable spectrum of particles  @xcite .",
    "the technique of calculating in external fields was heavily used for the calculation of quantum corrections to the effective action of gauge fields in the classical instanton background  @xcite . in practical applications to qcd",
    "the complex vacuum structure could explain a phase transition from the quark - gluon representation of green functions at high energies to the hadron picture at low energies .",
    "while the problem of a full description of this transition remains unresolved , wilson s operator product expansion which is one of the key tools for calculating the correlation functions at short distances is used for describing hadronic properties at low energies in a semiphenomenological way using sum rule techniques  @xcite .",

    "we calculate the low - energy limit of heavy quark current correlators within the @xmath0 expansion where @xmath6 is a heavy quark mass .",
    "the induced low - energy currents corresponding to the heavy quark initial operators are obtained from an effective action for gauge fields of the @xmath1 model in the one - loop approximation at leading order of both the coupling constant and the @xmath0 expansion .",

    "i.e.  for the analysis of @xmath126-resonances the dependence on the cutoff @xmath142 is numerically essential for moments at large @xmath78 and for @xmath142 as large as @xmath148 which is still small according to the estimates of radiative corrections in gluonic channels .",
    "we would like to remind the reader that coulomb poles which are essential for the analysis of the @xmath126-resonance and @xmath147-production near threshold give contributions which are formally of the @xmath83 order ( for the value of the coulombic wave function at the origin see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) , an order which coincides with the order of corrections considered here ( see eq .  ( [ piqvec ] ) ) .",
    "the theoretical expressions for the correlators in the scalar channel where below threshold corrections start at the @xmath138 order are more sensitive to these special below threshold contributions .",
    "however , data in the scalar channel are considerably worse than those in the vector channel and there is no possibility of a high precision analysis on the scalar channel at present .",
    "we have presented corrections to the heavy quark currents induced by a virtual heavy quark loop and expressed through the gluon operators .",
    "we have considered the electromagnetic current and the tensor current closely related to it .",
    "heavy quark loop induced corrections first appear at @xmath83 order of perturbation theory and are given by the @xmath57 term of the mass expansion in case of the electromagnetic current and by the @xmath135 term in case of the tensor current .",
    "the spectra of the correlators of such induced currents start at zero energy .",
    "this fact makes impossible the standard analysis of the moment sum rules at @xmath83 order of perturbation theory for @xmath134 in case of the electromagnetic current and for @xmath136 in case of the tensor current .      the work is partially supported by the russian fund for basic research under contracts 99 - 01 - 00091 and 01 - 02 - 16171 .",
