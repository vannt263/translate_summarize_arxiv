    "plans and designs for the next generation of accelerators need to be formulated in the near future , since the construction of these machines spans many years . the `` best '' machine to build for the post - lhc era will only become clear , however , when we see what surprises the lhc holds .",
    "faced with our imperfect knowledge , we must examine possible scenarios for lhc physics and determine the machine most likely to answer the physics questions remaining in the years following completion of the lhc and the fulfillment of its physics promise .    here",
    ", i will consider the physics of electroweak symmetry breaking at a high energy @xmath0 collider .",
    ", a @xmath1 collider operating at the higgs resonance can make extremely precise measurements of the higgs mass and couplings .",
    "i will not discuss the physics potential of a muon collider here.@xcite ] this discussion must be made in the context of potential discoveries at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "i begin by reviewing the current experimental status of electroweak symmetry breaking , both from direct higgs boson searches at lep2 and from precision electroweak measurements .",
    "theoretical expectations for the higgs boson mass are then reviewed , with emphasis on the implications for physics at higher mass scales .",
    "next , i review the discovery prospects for the higgs boson at both the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "the working hypothesis is that a weakly interacting higgs boson will be discovered , if it exists , at the tevatron or the lhc , and so the role of the next generation of accelerators will be to study the properties of a higgs boson .",
    "precision measurements of the mass , decay widths , and production rates will all be necessary in order to verify that a particle is the higgs boson of the standard model .    aside from the couplings to fermions and gauge bosons , we would also like to know that the higgs boson self - interactions result from the spontaneously broken scalar potential of the standard model .",
    "in order to do this , the three- and four- point self - couplings of the higgs boson must be measured .",
    "these couplings can only be probed by multi - higgs production , which has extremely small rates , both at the lhc and at a high energy @xmath0 collider .",
    "the focus in this note is on verifying the properties of the standard model higgs boson . in order to do this ,",
    "it is helpful to compare with the predictions of a supersymmetric model since these predictions may be quite different from those of the standard model . distinguishing between the standard model and a supersymmetric model is an important test of our understanding of the electroweak sector .",
    "if a higgs boson is not found at the tevatron or the lhc , the electroweak symmetry breaking sector must be strongly interacting .",
    "i end with a brief discussion of strong electroweak symmetry breaking and a view towards the future .",
    "-.5 in    -1.5 in    the standard model of electroweak interactions has been verified to the @xmath2 level through precision measurements at lep and sld.@xcite in fact , the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking remains the only unconfirmed area of the standard model .",
    "the standard model predicts the existence of a physical scalar particle , termed the higgs boson .",
    "the search for this particle is therefore a fundamental goal of all current and future accelerators since its discovery is needed to complete our knowledge of the electroweak sector .",
    "the mass is a free parameter of the theory and so the higgs boson must be systematically sought in all mass regions .",
    "the couplings of the scalar higgs boson , however , are completely specified in terms of the higgs vacuum expectation value , @xmath3 . hence branching ratios and production rates",
    "can be computed unambiguously in terms of the mass .",
    "measurements of ratios of branching rates can then be used to test the validity of the model .",
    "since the higgs boson contributes to electroweak radiative corrections at one loop , precision measurements from lep and sld can be used to infer a prefered value for the higgs mass .",
    "the contribution of the higgs boson to electroweak observables is logarithmic and so the limit on the higgs mass is not nearly as precise as the indirect limit on the top quark mass from precision measurements .",
    "the current @xmath4 confidence level limit is,@xcite @xmath5 it is important to understand that this limit assumes the validity of the standard model . quantum loops containing new particles can change this limit , as can new operators beyond those of the standard model .",

    "1 can be evaded.@xcite    the higgs boson mass is the only free parameter of the electroweak theory . although we can not compute its mass , there are certain theoretical restrictions following from the consistency of the theory .",
    "the scalar potential for an @xmath7 scalar doublet @xmath8 is , @xmath9 after the electroweak symmetry breaking has occured , there remains the physical scalar higgs boson @xmath10 .",
    "the quartic coupling , @xmath11 , is related to the higgs boson mass , @xmath12 now @xmath11 is not a fixed parameter , but scales with the relevent energy , @xmath13 , and so eq . [ potew ] is the potential at the electroweak scale . if @xmath11 is large , ( corresponding to a heavy higgs boson ) , then at a scale @xmath13,@xcite @xmath14 which can be solved to obtain , @xmath15 a sensible theory will have @xmath16 finite at all scales , ( @xmath17 is termed the landau pole ) , or correspondingly @xmath18 .",
    "this yields an upper bound on @xmath11 and hence on @xmath19 , @xmath20 if the standard model is valid to the gut scale , @xmath21 , then we have an approximate upper bound on the higgs mass,@xcite @xmath22 for any given value of @xmath23 , there is a corresponding upper bound on @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath23 is often termed the `` scale of new physics '' since above this scale , the standard model interactions are not valid .",
    "this bound is the upper curve on figure 1 .",
    "there is also a theoretical lower bound on @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath11 is small ( light @xmath24 ) , then @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the higgs - top quark yukawa coupling , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is a function of the gauge coupling constants , @xmath29 .",
    "we see that the large top quark mass tends to drive @xmath11 negative . in order for electroweak symmetry breaking to occur",

    "there have been many theoretical improvements to the naive bounds presented above , but the bottom line is the same : if the standard model is valid to the gut scale , then @xmath36 a higgs boson outside this mass region would be a signal for new physics at the corresponding scale @xmath23 .",

    "[ rangmh ] is particularly interesting since it could potentially be probed at the tevatron with an upgraded luminosity .",

    "unitarity of the @xmath37 elastic scattering amplitudes requires @xmath38 , while lattice calculations obtain a similar bound , @xmath39.@xcite all of the theoretical bounds of this section predict a higgs boson comfortably within the discovery range of the lhc and so if the standard model is correct , a higgs boson discovery should be just around the corner .",

    "the minimal supersymmetric model has two neutral higgs bosons , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , a charged higgs , @xmath44 , and a pseudoscalar , @xmath45 . the structure of the supersymmetric potential dictates that at lowest order all the couplings can be expressed in terms of two parameters , which are typically taken to be the pseudoscalar mass , @xmath46 , and the ratio of higgs vacuum expectation values , @xmath47 .",
    "all masses can then be expressed in terms of these two parameters.@xcite    the experimental limit on the higgs boson mass in a supersymmetric theory typically depends on @xmath47 .",
    "if we require that the limit be valid for all @xmath47 , there is a slightly lower @xmath4 confidence level limit than for the standard model higgs boson,@xcite @xmath48    the minimal supersymmetric theory has the remarkable feature that there is an upper bound on the lightest higgs boson resulting from the structure of the scalar potential .",

    "a standard model higgs boson should be discovered at the tevatron or the lhc . due to the small rate",

    "the lhc will see a higgs signal in multiple channels for all possible masses .",
    "the observation in multiple channels will allow preliminary measurements of the higgs coupling constants , as discussed in the next section .",
