    "a challenge placed before @xmath1cdm hydrodynamic cosmological simulations is to form realistic galaxies while matching such quantities as the stellar - mass to halo - mass relation and average star formation history as a function of halo mass and redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the interplay between stellar feedback processes , originating in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and filamentary and galaxy accretion , originating in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , give rise to extended metal - enriched gaseous structures surrounding galaxies , i.e. , the circumgalactic medium ( cgm ) .",
    "the exact role of the cgm in governing the observed properties of galaxies is not yet well established ; however , it is quite possible that the cgm is a highly regulating component of galaxies and , if better understood , could provide powerful insights into global galaxy relations ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )    thus , it is an additional challenge for successful simulations to also statistically match the observed distributions of gas density , temperature , kinematics , and chemical and ionization conditions of the cgm . in general , there are two main approaches to simulating galaxies and the cgm . the first uses smoothed particles hydrodynamics ( sph ) , which discretizes gas mass into particles , and the second uses adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) , which spatially discretizes the gas using grid cells .",
    "sph simulations generally trade off high spatial and mass resolution in favor of modeling the hydrodynamics in thousands of galaxies in a simulation box",
    ". a great strength of sph simulations is that the statistical characteristics of the cgm can be studied over a wide range of halo mass and cosmological environment .",
    "the draw back is that the detailed physics of stellar formation and feedback are generally in the form of scaling relations , such as constant velocity winds , or winds with launch velocities proportional to the stellar velocity dispersion , which scales with the gravitational potential ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these relations do not directly address the underlying physics of feedback .",
    "a strength of amr simulations is that the star formation and feedback models directly target the underlying physical processes of star formation and feedback . though the processes are still unresolved , the physics is highly detailed and the simulations can be employed to study star formation at the scale of molecular cloud physics and stellar feedback at the scale of radiation pressure physics and photo - heating physics @xcite . with such detail ,",
    "the draw back is that only a few galaxies can be simulated at a time .",
    "however , with amr , greater insight into the complex interplay between star formation and feedback that regulates the cgm , and therefore galaxy formation and evolution , can be gleaned .",
    "observationally , the primary method for studying the gas properties of the cgm is the technique of quasar absorption lines .",
    "the most commonly studied cgm absorption lines are  @xmath2 ( ) and  @xmath3 ( ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and the sodium isosequence zero - volt resonant doublet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "virtually all of the physical conditions we have learned about the cgm are derived from absorption line analysis . as such , studying the cgm properties of simulated galaxies and",
    "quantitatively comparing these properties to those derived from observations is clearly best accomplished using absorption line measurement and analysis methods ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    absorption line analysis of simulations will not only directly increase our knowledge of the cgm and its role in galaxy evolution , but will provide a profound insight into how effective and accurate commonly applied observational analysis methods recover the `` true '' gas properties ( densities , temperatures , chemical and ionization conditions , and kinematics ) . to accomplish these objectives , we must quantitatively compare the inferred gas properties derived from observational techniques applied to synthetic absorption lines in simulations directly to the physical properties of the simulation gas from which the absorption arises .    for example , ionization models ( e.g. , cloudy , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are used to determine the gas density , @xmath4 , and metallicity , as well as the ionization parameter , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the number density of hydrogen ionizing photons .",
    "many assumptions are invoked in applying these models , such as single - phase absorbing clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or simple two - phase absorbing clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "how appropriate are these assumptions ?",
    "quantifying the relationships between absorption profiles , the inferred properties of the absorbing gas from the absorption line data , and the true  properties of the gas giving rise to the absorption in the simulations can provide insight to this question .",
    "a second example is the inferred kinematics , which is either assumed to be provided by the profile of the column density with velocity via the apparent optical depth ( aod ) column density method ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or reflected in voigt profile ( vp ) decomposition of the absorption profile ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , inferring the properties of the gas using either the aod profile method and vp decomposition implicitly relies on the assumption that gas at a given velocity arises from a single unique spatial location along the line of sight .",
    "furthermore , vp decomposition models the data as isothermal clouds , each having a different peculiar velocity . using simulations , the relative spatial locations of the absorbing gas along the los can be examined to quantify the degree to which absorption with similar ( or aligned ) kinematics arises in the same spatial gas structures .",
    "this latter information has important implications for the assumptions applied to the ionization modeling and kinematic analysis of observed data .    to be effective",
    ", the application of absorption line analysis to simulations should emulate observational work as closely as possible so that the selection methods , spectral resolution , sensitivity limitations , and analysis techniques of various absorption - line surveys can be accurately duplicated . in general ,",
    "surveys target a limited number of absorption line transitions , each which probe a relatively narrow range of gas phase , i.e. , they arise in gas with favorable density , temperature , ionization conditions , and metallicities .",
    "this will also be true for absorption lines in synthetic spectra obtained by passing sightlines through the cgm in hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "for example , along a single sightline , some gas structures may contribute to and/or absorption , whereas other unique gas structures may contribute to absorption , but not to or absorption .",
    "but , importantly , all our knowledge of the cgm from absorption line analysis is filtered through the instruments that modify the data .",
    "which instrument and telescope facility is used to observe a given absorption line depends upon the rest wavelength of the transition and the redshift of the absorbing structure , and this strongly governs the design , sensitivity , and data quality for observational surveys . since which absorption lines get observed depend upon which facilities capture the wavelength range of the redshifted transition , this governs which gas phases can be probed and to what level of sensitivity they can be probed .    furthermore , the range of physical gas properties that contribute to detectable absorption will differ as a function of the detection thresholds of the spectra , which depends on the signal - to - noise ratio , resolution , and pixelization of the data . shallower detection thresholds result in probing gas with higher column densities , which presumably means that higher density , higher metallicity gas , or favorable ionization conditions are preferentially being studied .",
    "this holds true for both real - world observations and synthetic spectra from simulations , provided that the synthetic spectra are carefully designed to emulate real - world spectra .    with the aforementioned considerations in mind , in this paper we describe the methods we developed to generate `` realistic '' synthetic spectra through simulated galaxies in amr cosmological simulations and to analyze the spectra , all in a manner that emulates real - world observations . in section  [ sec : sims ] we describe the simulated galaxy we employ for this study . in section  [ sec : ionmodel ] , we briefly review the ionization model @xcite used to obtain the gas ionization conditions .",

    "physical processes implemented in the code include star formation , stellar feedback , type ii and ia metal enrichment , thermal and radiation pressure , and metallicity - dependent cooling and heating .",
    "gas is self - shielded , advects metals , is heated by a homogeneous ultraviolet background , and can cool to 300 k due to metal and molecular line cooling .",

    "the star particles form in the dense , cold molecular phase ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 k ) .",
    "the star formation rate is proportional to the gas density divided by the free fall time of the molecular cloud .",
    "we use an observationally motivated low ( 2% percent ) efficiency per free fall time for converting gas into stars . compared to previous methods",
    "@xcite , this treatment results in a greater number of individual star particles , but with smaller masses , between @xmath14 and @xmath15 m@xmath16 .",
    "runaway young , hot stars are included according to @xcite by providing one third of the newly - formed star particles with a random velocity kick .",

    "this non - coincidence of and absorption - selected gas would not be perceptible in real - world observations .",
    "since some of the absorption has los velocities coincident with the absorption , it is likely that when employing common observational analysis methods some fraction of the column density would be attributed to the absorbing gas phase ( what fraction depends upon a somewhat subjective educated estimate or `` artfully '' modeling of the absorption , such as vp decomposition ) .",
    "therefore , it is almost assured that the metallicity of the absorbing phase would then be underestimated in observational studies .",
    "this would suggest that there may be systematic bias in the metallicity determinations derived from observed systems that exhibit low - ionization absorption conditions , since the column density might arise only within the low - ionization phase .",

    "the vp component column densities for the absorption are fairly consistent with the cell column densities , though the @xmath300   component is @xmath301 dex below the dominant absorbing cells .",
    "the column densities of the vp components are also @xmath302 dex higher than the peak column densities of the absorbing cells .",
    "if we examine the inferred temperatures of the gas from the vp components [ figure  [ fig : aod - times](d ) ] , we see that the component temperatures are also overestimated .",
    "since the lower ionization profiles are decomposed into only two components , the doppler @xmath189 parameters are likely to be systematically large ; that is , the kinematic morphology of the absorption is due to a steep velocity gradient across the los ( see the @xmath198 panels of figure  [ fig : los ] ) , which has been modeled as two thermally broadened `` clouds '' .    for the and absorption ,",
    "the vp component column densities and temperatures are significantly overestimated , roughly by @xmath303 dex and @xmath302 dex , respectively .",
    "in fact , the inferred temperatures from the vp components are @xmath304 , and are approaching temperatures commonly assumed to be indicative of collisional ionization for these two ions ( in the following subsection , we show that the and absorbing gas is dominated by photoionization equilibrium ) .",
    "the very broad component suggests @xmath305 , but the vp component broadening is clearly modeling the bulk velocity flow .",
    "these considerations serve as a warning that vp decomposition can be highly misleading about the ionization condition of the gas , and may simply be a flawed approach to modeling and absorbing gas ( as we discuss further below ) .    these discrepancies with the vp decomposition would undoubtedly systematically skew estimated of the gas density and metallicity inferred from ionization modeling of the vp components . however , when we examine the _ total _ column densities , we find good agreement between the aod columns , @xmath306 , the vp column densities , and the absorbing cell column densities .    in table",

    "[ eq : naod ] , and the total for the `` cells '' is the sum of the absorption selected cell column densities . that the totals are in good agreement is promising , for the consistency between observational methods for obtaining the total column densities and the actual total column density of the gas selected by absorption would imply that mass estimates of the cgm using integrated aod profiles and summed vp column densities accurately recover the gas mass for both the low and high ionization cgm ( for example , as done by * ? ? ?",

    "the same can not be said for the gas giving rise to and absorption .",
    "for these ions , we see that multiple absorbing gas structures arise with virtually identical velocities and that these structures can have up to a @xmath8 dex spread in column densities .",
    "that is , the flux decrement at any given velocity can result from the sum of the column densities from multiple cells that happen to have the same los velocity .",
    "when we further consider the spatial locations of absorbing cells with the same los velocity , we find that the assumption underlying standard observational analysis of the absorption profiles is not validated by the kinematic - spatial distribution of the absorbing gas for all ions .",
    "as mentioned above while discussing figure  [ fig : aod - times](f ) , the absorption and the absorption is distributed over a range of velocities in gas that forms a single contiguous structure at @xmath319 ( i.e. , a single `` cloud '' ) . however , at most los velocities , the and absorbing gas originates from multiple groupings of cells with physical separations ranging from a few to 150 kpc .",
    "for example , the absorption in the range of @xmath320   arises in six physically distinct los locations spread over 100 kpc with typical los separations of @xmath321 kpc , whereas the cells in each of these spatial groupings are contiguous over one to a few kpc .",
    "not only does the absorption arise in gas distributed over @xmath14 kpc , the gas is characterized by a complex velocity field that reverses direction along the los several times that results in los velocity caustics where the column densities of physically unconnected gas structures are summed .",
    "the absorption exhibits similar behavior .",
    "we note that in a double line - of - sight experiment , @xcite concluded that the absorption arises in large extended structures that are consistent with our simulation results .",
    "the fact that and arise in these extended structures with complex spatial and velocity fields is no doubt the reason that the vp component doppler @xmath189 parameters yield inferred temperatures that are @xmath8 dex too high [ see figure  [ fig : aod - times](d ) ] .    in summary",
    ", current observational analysis techniques may be valid for low - ionization gas .",
    "as mentioned above , the and absorption arises in a single contiguous gas structure .",
    "the density and temperature ranges of this structure are @xmath322 and @xmath323 , respectively . based upon standard observational techniques and cloudy modeling applied to cos spectra , ( * ? ? ?",

    "* @xmath325 galaxies ) constrained the properties of the cool / warm photoionized cgm to reside near these values and to be generally consistent with the phase diagrams of and absorbing gas shown in figure  [ fig : phases ] .",
    "however , becasue of the complex spatial - kinematic distrbution of the higher - ionization gas , current observational techniques of and absorption likely do _ not _ correctly model the underlying physics of the absorbing gas .",
    "the implication of the kinematic - spatial distribution of the absorbing gas is that observational analysis techniques ( i.e. , aod column density and/or vp decomposition coupled with ionization modeling ) that are founded on the absorbing gas at a given los velocity arising in a physically contiguous gas structure may be quite invalid ( especially for high - ionization species ) .",
    "it remains to be determined to what degree of accuracy the inferred densities , temperatures , and metallicites from observational modeling techniques are recovered when applied to the simulated spectra and compared to the gas cell properties . in the near future , we aim to undertake such a study ( vander vliet 2014b , in preparation ) .",
    "we now turn to the question as to whether cgm absorbing gas can be modeled with equilibrium ionization models .",
    "we also investigate methods for determining if the absorbing gas is photoionized or collisionally ionized .",
    "since most all ionization modeling of observational data is based upon the assumption of ionization equilibrium , it is important to understand to what degree this assumption holds .",
    "our ionization modeling , and therefore all subsequent absorption line analysis of the simulations , is also is based upon this assumption .",
    "investigations into non - equilibrium ionization had been investigated by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "non - equilibrium collisional ionization results in a reduction of the column density relative to the equilibrium solution , though @xcite find that non - equilibrium effects are not as pronounced when photoionization is taken into account .",
    "whether the gas is predominantly photoionized or collisionally ionized has implications for correctly estimating the density , temperature , physical size , cooling time , and estimated mass of the absorbing gas ( in otherwords , understanding the physical nature of the cgm , and subsequently its role in galaxy evolution ) . in observational work one can not directly deduce whether the gas is dominated by photoionization or collisional ionization .",
    "often , inferences of collisional iopnization are based upon the presence of large thermal velocity widths in the absorption profiles , or the column density ratios of different ions in different ionization stages ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , from the ionization modeling one can directly examine the degree to which the ionization balance in the absorbing gas is dominated by photoionization or collisional ionization .",
    "the method we employ can also be applied to observational work .",
    "the condition of ionization equilibrium is that the gas must be thermally stable over the time required for the photoionization , recombination , and collisional ionization rates to achieve a steady - state balance . if the time required to achieve ionization equilibrium is denoted @xmath326 , the condition is often expressed , @xmath327 where @xmath328 is the cooling timescale . here",

    "both @xmath333 and @xmath334 are functions of the spectral energy distribution of ionizing photons , the gas density , @xmath4 temperature , @xmath35 , and the relative abundances of the metals .",

    "thus , the ionization timescales are the @xmath343-folding time for a change in the numder density .",

    "we also plot the cooling timescales ( black @xmath110 symbols ) .",
    "the h@xmath119 ion is clearly in photoionization equlibrium .",
    "the photoionization and recombination timescales are equal and both of these are roughly three orders of magnitude shorter than the collisional ionization timescales",

    "[ eq : eqcool ] for ionization equilibrium .",
    "the collisional ionization processes of hydrogen do not achieve equilibrium , since the gas cools on similar timescales , but photoionization completely dominates the ionization of hydrogen .",
    "the mg@xmath120 ion , on the otherhand , is in near balance between photoionization , collisional ionization , and recombination .",
    "however , the assumption of ionization equilibrium is well satisfied for the majority of gas in that the cooling timescales exceed the ionization timescales .    in the cases of c@xmath66 and o@xmath67 , the ions are in equilibrium between the recombination and photoionization timescales . for both ions ,",
    "the collisional ionization timescales exceed @xmath363 gyr ; the gas giving rise to and absorption is clearly dominated by photoionization .",
    "furthermore , the assumption of ionization equilibrium is well supported by the long cooling timescales . at los velocities of @xmath364",

    "this lends a great deal of confidence that observational data can be accurately analyzed using ionization equilibrium for these ions .",
    "futhermore , we have shown that it is straight forward to determine whether a given ion is photoionized or collisionally ionized in the absorbing gas of the simulated cgm . in principle , the method can be applied to observational data if the photoionization , collisional ionization , and recombination rate coefficients from the ionization modeling are retreivable .",
    "however , we caution that using column densities of individual vp components may not yield an ionization model that reflects the absorbing gas conditions ( see section  [ sec : kin - space ] ) .",
    "we have presented a case as to why a comprehensive understanding of the cgm via absorption line studies requires objective absorption line analysis of high resolution hydrodynamic cosmological simulations that mirrors observational absorption line methods .",
    "most importantly , we argued and demonstrated that the synthetic absorption line spectra of the simulated cgm should emulate the observed spectra in all of its characteristics , as should the analysis of the absorption line measurements obtain directly from the spectra .",
    "primarily , this assures that the gas selected by absorption in the simulated cgm is directly comparable to the gas selected by absorption in the observed cgm .",
    "the point is that , when comparing the simulated cgm gas properties ( densities , temperatures , kinematics , ionization and chemical conditions , and spatial distributions ) to the properties of the cgm gas inferred from observational absorption line studies , only the gas that is selected by the simulated absorption lines should be compared . only in this fashion",
    "are direct insights into observational analysis and the physical nature of the cgm gleaned .",
    "we generated absorption profiles for the and transitions , and for the spectra of and , @xmath365 , @xmath156 , @xmath366 and @xmath157 , , , and metal - line transitions for 1000 los through the cgm of a simulated dwarf galaxy from the work of @xcite .",
    "though in this paper we focused on a single los for illustrating the relationships between commonly observed absorption lines and the underlying properties of the absorbing gas , the results discussed for this los are generally true from los to los .",
    "highlights of our findings for the cgm of this simulated galaxy are :    0.1 in ( 1 ) the simulations indicate that low ionization gas , as probed in absorption with ions having ionization potentials near the hydrogen ionization edge , likely arise from what might be called `` clouds '' . along the los",
    ", these structures are characterized by a narrow range of densities and temperatures , suggesting they can be modeled as single phase structures .",
    "in addition , the absorption lines arise in gas that is localized along the los ( the grid cells in the simulations are spatially contiguous ) . as such , commonly applied observational analysis methods that incorporate aod column densities , vp decomposition , and single phase ionization modeling are likely to be sound .",
    "0.1 in ( 2 ) the simulations indicate that higher ionization gas likely arises in extended structures that sample gas distributed up to 50100 kpc along the los .",
    "furthermore , the absorption at a given los velocity can arise in several smaller scale regions of the gas separated by tens of kiloparsecs that circumstantially align in los velocity .",
    "the gas phases ( densities and temperatures ) that give rise to absorption at a given los velocity can vary up to an order of magnitude or more .",
    "as such , aod profiles and vp decomposition do not properly reflect the high - ionization absorbing gas properties .",
    "ionization modeling of higher ionization gas as `` cloud''-like structures should be viewed with healthy skepticism",
    ". however , aod profiles and vp decomposition can accurately reflect the total gas mass and average gas properties , because the _ total _ column densities from these methods are highly consistent with the total gas column along a los .    0.1 in ( 3 ) higher ionization gas , such as absorption selected gas , can have los absorption velocities that overlap with the los absorption velocity of absorption selected gas , but the simulations indicate that in not all cases is the absorption associated with the higher ionization absorbing gas . in addition to the caveats for point ( 2 ) above , this presents further challenges for ionization modeling and metallicity estimates of the high ionization cgm .",
    "0.1 in ( 4 ) estimates of the ionization timescales and the cooling timescales of the gas that gives rise to detected absorption indicate that the gas can be successfully modeled as being in ionization equilibrium .",
    "broad absorption in high - ionization ions does not necessarily indicate high temperature gas that is often taken to imply collisional ionization dominates .",
    "in fact , we found that vp decomposition of and absorption yielded temperatures consistent with collisional ionization when in fact the absorbing gas is roughly 1 dex cooler and the broadening is due to the complexity of the spatial and velocity fields over the extended absorbing structure .",
    "indeed , analysis of the ionization modeling showed that the and absorbing gas is photoionized .    0.1 in to the extent that the cgm of this simulated galaxy reflects the real world",
    ", the points we have discussed here provide our first qualitative insights into the effectiveness or possible misapplication of standard absorption line analysis methods applied to studies of the cgm .",
    "however , we have studied the simulated cgm of a single isolated low - mass ( dwarf ) galaxy .",
    "the star formation history is highly stochastic and `` bursty '' @xcite , and there are no satellite galaxies and filamentary accretion is negligible .",
    "the effects of both these characteristics are certainly manifest in the global cgm properties of this simulated galaxy .",
    "it remains to be seen if the cgm of higher mass galaxies in more complex cosmological environments presents a substantially different or broader set of insights .    in the future",
