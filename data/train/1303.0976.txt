    "the triplet contact process with diffusion ( tcpd ) model belongs to a set of closely related models of `` fermionic '' particles on a lattice that follow very simple dynamical rules . with _ fermionic _",
    "we mean in this context that only one particle can be present at each site .",
    "these models have been studied extensively , because they were conjectured by grassberger @xcite and janssen @xcite to belong to a relatively small number of dynamical universality classes , determined by coarse features such as the dimensionality , symmetries in the model , and conservation laws ; in close analogy to universality classes in equilibrium statistical physics .    historically , the first of these models to be studied extensively is the directed percolation ( dp ) model .",
    "this model lends itself extremely well for computer simulations , and its exponents are therefore known with high accuracy .",
    "for example , using exact enumeration techniques , the exponent @xmath7 was found to be 0.159464(6 ) @xcite , where @xmath7 is defined through the time dependence of the particle density @xmath0 of the system , starting from a state with a uniform high density :    @xmath9    even though this model is very easy from a numerical point of view , there are no theoretical predictions for these exponents , not even in one dimension . since the grassberger ",
    "janssen conjecture says that the dp model belongs to a larger class of models with the same critical exponents , much effort has been undertaken to verify numerically the exponents in models that are also expected to be in the same universality class .    in one interpretation of the dp model , particles are placed on a lattice , and follow two reactions : with a statistical rate @xmath10 , each particle annihilates , and with a statistical rate @xmath11 , each particle creates a new particle on an adjacent site , provided that it is vacant . sometimes , the particles can also hop to neighboring lattice sites with a diffusion rate @xmath12 .",
    "an extension of the dp model that has been studied thoroughly in literature is the pair contact process with diffusion ( pcpd ) model , in which the annihilation and procreation reactions can only take place if two particles are placed next to each other ( and with @xmath13 ) .",
    "there has been a lot of discussion about the critical exponents , mainly @xmath7 , with estimates ranging from the dp - value @xmath14 @xcite to @xmath15 @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we performed simulations of the pcpd model in which the triple product @xmath16 , where @xmath17 independent simulations are performed with a lattice of size @xmath18 over a time range @xmath19 , is much larger than in previous studies .",
    "the resulting data showed that in the case of the pcpd model , finite - time corrections are particularly severe , and with careful analysis we found more evidence suggesting a value close to the dp value , than the contrary .    here",
    ", we simulate the tcpd model , which makes annihilation and procreation conditional on triplets of particles . currently , the claim in literature is that tcpd is fundamentally different from both the pcpd and dp models , as evidenced by different values for exponents , e.g. @xmath20@xcite and @xmath4@xcite .",
    "we use the same efficient algorithm , described in @xcite , to reach a triple product ( @xmath21 ) which is almost three orders of magnitude larger than in these previous studies .",
    "we find that for shorter times , the exponent @xmath7 is very close to its mean field prediction of @xmath22 , but for very long times , this exponent starts to drift .",
    "we attribute this to finite - time effects that are even stronger than in the case of pcpd . even with our fast algorithm and long simulations , we were not able to reach time scales that make it possible to retrieve an accurate estimate for @xmath7 .",
    "importantly , however , we find that the dp value can not be excluded , meaning that it is not yet proven that the tcpd model falls outside the dp universality class .",
    "several slightly different versions of the tcpd model have been studied .",
    "we use a version with the reactions @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which is described by the following reactions and rates :    @xmath25    in a straightforward implementation of this model , first the type of reaction is selected , based on a random number @xmath26 , and depending on its value , one of the reactions is proposed ( but not always carried out ) :    * if @xmath27 , a random pair of neighboring sites @xmath28 is selected ; in case one site is occupied and the other is empty , the particle hops from the occupied site to the empty one . * else if @xmath29 , a random triplet of sites @xmath30 is selected ; if all three sites are occupied , they are all made vacant . * else if @xmath31 , a random triplet of sites @xmath32 is selected ; if all three sites are occupied and site @xmath33 is vacant , a particle is placed on this last site . * else",
    ", a random triplet of sites @xmath32 is selected ; if all three sites are occupied and site @xmath34 is vacant , a particle is placed on this last site .",
    "irrespective the type of reaction and its success , the time scale is incremented by @xmath35 .",
    "these steps are then iterated many times .",
    "as noted in the introduction , for the results presented here , we used as a basis an algorithm that leverages the power of graphics processing units ( gpus ) , which is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "before one can actually measure the exponent @xmath7 , a prerequisite is to determine the critical annihilation rate @xmath36 . for low annihilation rates ( @xmath37 ) ,",
    "the system will , given enough time , settle with extremely high probability for a more or less constant particle density .",
    "this regime is called the active regime . on the other hand , in the inactive regime with high annihilation rates ( @xmath38 )",
    ", the particles will quickly die out . in between ,",
    "exactly at @xmath39 , there is the critical regime , where the density decreases slower than in the inactive regime , following a power - law decay with a critical exponent @xmath7 .",
    "thus , it is necessary to first identify an estimate for the critical point @xmath36 , before we can estimate the critical exponent @xmath7 . to this effect",
    "we use as our main tool the effective exponent @xmath40 as a function of time , defined as :    @xmath41    and a similar expression for the effective exponent @xmath42 for the pair density . substituting the asymptotic behavior as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho ] ) , we retrieve that @xmath43 as @xmath44 goes to infinity .",
    "the procedure is equivalent to numerical differentiation of @xmath45 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : numdif ] ) shows that there is still freedom in choosing @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the trade - off is as follows : if we choose @xmath46 closer to @xmath47 , the plot is generally more accurate , in the sense that features present in the analytical @xmath40 curve are less smoothed out and lost that way . on the other hand , the curve is much more noisy .",
    "we found that in our case choosing @xmath48 gives good results .",
    "we find an estimate for @xmath36 by a manual binary search , which sounds more cumbersome than it is , because far from @xmath36 the @xmath40 plots are very clearly recognizable as either sub- or super - critical . closer to @xmath36 it gets much harder to estimate @xmath36 , because of the drift in the effective exponent , which gives our estimate for @xmath36 a larger error bar . apart from the density @xmath0 of the system",
    ", we can also measure the pair density @xmath1 .",
    "this is especially useful for testing the validity of mean field theory , as it predicts that @xmath49 , and thus also @xmath50 .    for each value of @xmath10 we performed at least @xmath51 independent simulations of runs up to @xmath52 , with a lattice size of @xmath53 .",
    "we simulated at annihilation rates between @xmath54 and @xmath55 : 0.095 , 0.09504 , 0.09508 , 0.09511 , 0.09512 , 0.095125 , 0.09513 , always with @xmath56 .",
    "our estimate for the critical annihilation rate is @xmath57 .",
    "( black curves ) and the pair density @xmath1 ( gray curves ) as a function of time in a double logarithmic plot .",
    "the lattice size is @xmath58 , with 200 independent runs for each value of @xmath10 and @xmath59.,width=377 ]    first , in figure [ fig : rho ] we present the raw simulation data of the average particle density @xmath0 and the pair density @xmath1 as a function of time , starting from a random initial state with density @xmath60 ( and @xmath61 ) .",
    "the particle density shows an approximately straight line in a double logarithmic plot , indicating power - law behavior . at the same @xmath10 values , the pair density shows strong curvature , which indicates strong finite - time corrections to power - law behavior .",
    "we note that curves close to the critical point look qualitatively similar to the ones found in ref .",
    "@xcite , although the slope is different : we find @xmath62 , whereas they reported @xmath63 . in our opinion , this discrepancy can be attributed to differences in finite - time corrections , due to details in the models .",
    "because our data has very small error bars , we can use @xmath40 to investigate the `` power - law '' like behavior of the density and the pair density in more detail .     as obtained for both the particle density @xmath0 ( colored black ) and the pair density @xmath1 ( gray ) , as a function of @xmath64 .",
    "the lattice size is @xmath58 , with 200 independent runs for each value of @xmath10 and @xmath59.,width=377 ]    the effective exponents @xmath40 and @xmath42 , describing the decay of particles and of pairs of particles , are plotted against @xmath65 in figure [ fig : delta_eff ] , with values for @xmath10 close to @xmath36 .",
    "we chose @xmath66 , as this is a rough estimate for the exponent governing the leading finite - time corrections . as we will not use any extrapolation method ,",
    "the choice for @xmath67 does not affect our conclusions .",
    "it is clear from the plot that @xmath68 , even at short times @xmath44 , and thus we conclude that mean field theory does not correctly describe the tcpd model .",
    "the figure also shows that some curves first ascend to a value for @xmath40 of mean field theory ( @xmath22 ) , then turn slightly downwards to values of around @xmath69 , and then ascend above @xmath22 again .",
    "we interpret this behavior as a signature of a @xmath10-value which is close to , but slightly below @xmath36 , as the data roughly follow the critical curve , before reaching the inactive regime .",
    "our main reason is that we find it very unlikely that the critical curve makes more than one bend on these time scales .",
    "thus , we find a lower bound : @xmath70 .",
    "obviously , if our assumption is not correct this lower bound is also not correct .",
    "however , were this the case we believe that any attempt at numerical analysis will be impossible with the current simulation approach and state of software and hardware . another important aspect to note is that @xmath40 and @xmath42 are closing in on each other in a way very similar to that in the pcpd model @xcite .     between the pair density @xmath1 and the particle density @xmath0 as a function of @xmath65 , with @xmath66 .",
    "the precise value of @xmath67 is not important here . at criticality",
    "the curve seems to arrive at the vertical axis at a value higher than @xmath71 , which means that eventually @xmath72 will reach a constant value.,width=377 ]    the ratio @xmath6 is plotted in figure [ fig : ratio ] against @xmath65 , again with @xmath66 , for different values of @xmath10 , including ones that are above @xmath36 .",
    "we have to be more careful here in our choice of @xmath67 , because we are trying to make a conclusion about the extrapolated value .",
    "if we assume that @xmath73 , then the choice @xmath74 combined with linear extrapolation yields the correct constant for @xmath75 . on the other hand , choosing @xmath76 yields an overestimation , whereas @xmath77 gives us a prediction lower than the true value . since we are not interested in the exact value of the ratio at @xmath78 , but only in whether it is equal to 0 or higher , we try to choose @xmath77 . since @xmath79 is unknown , we chose a value for @xmath67 , such that the critical curves seem to arrive close to horizontally at the x - axis , which is indicative of @xmath80 . in figure",
    "[ fig : ratio ] , all curves are approaching the vertical axis ( corresponding to @xmath78 ) in a way that strongly suggests that it will go to a finite value .",
    "thus , we conclude that the ratio @xmath6 approaches a non - zero value as @xmath78 .",
    "we have performed extensive simulations of the one - dimensional tcpd model , using a highly efficient gpu - based simulation approach .",
    "we find that the tcpd model is not described by mean field theory , as evidenced by the convergence of the ratio of the pair density and the particle density @xmath6 to a non - zero value at criticality , instead of going to zero as expected by mean field theory .",
    "given the similarities between the pcpd model and the tcpd model with regards to finite - time corrections , we find it not unlikely that they both belong to the dp universality class .",
    "numerical evidence for the pcpd model belonging to the dp universality class was given by us in ref .",
    "we emphasize that there is no solid numerical evidence propositioning a value of @xmath7 for the tcpd model .",
    "however , we do find an upper bound @xmath70 , which excludes most previous literature values for this exponent in tcpd , and is also less than mean field .",
    "thus a safer conclusion is that numerical data does not exclude the possibility that tcpd and pcpd belong to the dp universality class , and that this should still be considered as a serious possibility .    computing time on the  little green machine \" , which is funded by the dutch agency nwo , is acknowledged .",
