    "many papers have been devoted along the years to the various biases that can arise in the determination of stellar luminosities from trigonometric parallaxes . the advent of the hipparcos catalogue , with its unprecented accuracy and homogeneous data , could have been the occasion to efficiently take these biases into account .",
    "it seems , on the contrary , that in the majority of recent papers the sample selections have been mostly based on the parallax relative precision ( based on @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes the hipparcos parallax and @xmath2 its formal precision ) while it is well known that sample truncations on the parallax relative error lead to biased estimates of quantities derived from the parallax .",
    "furthermore , the various adopted limits on @xmath0 are merely a balance between the expected precision on the resulting absolute magnitude and the size of the sample and thus are not based on any statistical criteria . some illustrative examples are shown in section [ literature ]    the effects of random errors will be thoroughly discussed in the following sections , but it is interesting to summarise here what a truncation on the `` observed '' relative error @xmath3 implicitly implies for the resulting sample :    * the truncation on @xmath4 should produce an approximate volume - limited sample , but the error on @xmath4 is correlated with the error on the absolute magnitude , implying a bias on this quantity ; * for a given @xmath4 , the precision @xmath2 is mainly due to photon noise , so that brighter stars will be preferentially selected ; * for a given apparent magnitude @xmath2 also depends on the ecliptic latitude ( due to the hipparcos scanning law ) thus adding a spatial selection ; * the values of @xmath2 used are not the `` real '' values of the precision but its estimates .",
    "thus , @xmath3 is the combination of two random variables , making the truncation more statistically complex ; * it should also be taken into account that the initial sample ( before truncation ) represents the content of the hipparcos catalogue .",
    "apart from the `` survey '' , which is rather well defined , the other selections from which the catalogue was built are not always clear ( e.g. a kinematical bias for nearby stars ) . further observing problems may have also happened , leading to the rejection of other stars .",
    "the final effect is that there is in fact _ no _ knowledge of the representativeness of the sample with respect to the parent population .",
    "any statistics computed from this sample using parallaxes will probably be a biased estimate of the quantity which one would like to obtain for the parent population . furthermore",
    ", if a generic ( in the sense of not specifically adapted to the characteristics of the sample ) bias correction is applied , the accuracy of the result is hardly predictable .",
    "this is e.g. the case for the lutz - kelker ( 1973 ) correction , which assumes an uniform stellar density , whereas this assumption may not be realistic .",
    "even if it is adequate , the confidence interval of the correction may be very large ( koen , 1992 ) , so that the precision on absolute magnitude will be rather poor .",
    "in general , truncating in parallax relative error in the hope of benefiting from smaller random errors finally gives greater systematic errors .",
    "moreover , the rejection of stars with high relative errors wastes a large amount of data , from which the random errors could have been reduced . anticipating the conclusion of this paper ,",
    "it must be noted that no selection on the observed parallaxes should be done .",
    "it should also be remembered that the observing list of the brighter stars in the hipparcos catalogue ( survey ) was defined on purpose , in order to benefit from clearly defined samples . when it applies , the selection on apparent magnitude",
    "may then be taken into account in the estimation procedure .",
    "the effect of this selection ( malmquist bias ) is discussed in section  [ malmquist ]",
    "since the effect of random parallax errors on derived quantities will be discussed in section  [ effects ] , we review in this section the general properties of hipparcos errors .      it has been shown in various papers ( e.g. arenou , 1995 , 1997 ) that in general the random errors of the hipparcos parallaxes may be considered gaussian .",
    "this may be seen for instance when these parallaxes are compared to ground - based values of similar precision , or to distant stars using photometric estimates , using the normalised differences ( parallax differences divided by the square root of the quadratic sum of the formal errors ) .",
    "this nice property of the parallax errors may then fully be used in parametrical approaches which make use of the conditional law of the observed parallaxes given the true parallax .",
    "the particular case of systematic errors at small angular scale will be discussed in section [ smallscale ] ; for an all - sky sample , one may safely consider that the global systematic error is small ( @xmath5mas ) , that the formal errors are good estimates of the random error dispersions and that the random errors are uncorrelated from star to star .",
    "due to their gaussian behaviour , random errors in the hipparcos catalogue are of course expected to produce a number of stars whose astrometric parameters deviate significantly from the @xmath6 error level so that , of course , some hundredths of stars are expected to have an observed parallax which deviates , say , 3 mas from the true parallax value .",
    "this is a logical consequence in a large catalogue like hipparcos .    in a few cases , however",
    ", it may happen that the error on the hipparcos data is much higher than expected .",
    "although these are probably rare cases , they have been mentioned for the sake of completeness in the hipparcos documentation and illustrated here .",
    "apart from the double and multiple star annex ( dmsa , see esa 1997 ) , most of the hipparcos catalogue is constituted by stars assumed to be single .",
    "one obvious source of outliers may thus be undetected short period binarity , since in this case the astrometric path of the star will not exactly follow the assumed single star model ( 5 parameters : position , parallax , linear proper motion ) .",
    "two extreme cases of astrometric binaries are discussed below , which may have been biased respectively in parallax and proper motion .",
    "it must be stressed that these cases are statistically rare and chosen for the purpose of illustration , and that the duplicity had in fact been detected by hipparcos and flagged in the catalogue .",
    "the first example concerns hip 21433 , one of the 1561 hipparcos stochastic solutions ( dmsa / x ) , where an excess scatter of the measurements may be interpreted as the signature of an unknown orbital motion . indeed , this star is a spectroscopic binary .",
    "the interesting fact is that the period is 330 days , i.e. close to one year , so that there may have been a confusion between the parallactic and orbital motion . adopting the 4 known orbital elements ( @xmath7,@xmath8,@xmath9,@xmath10 ) from tokovinin ( 1994 ) ,",
    "the intermediate astrometric data has been re - reduced taking into account the 5 astrometric parameters and the 7 orbital parameters , and the new parallax found is @xmath11 mas , instead of @xmath12 mas as in the published stochastic solution .",
    "the parallax from the hipparcos solution , which does not take into account the binarity , has thus possibly been biased , due to the @xmath13 year orbital motion .",
    "the second example concerns hip 13081 , one of the 2622 acceleration solutions ( dmsa / g ) , where the motion has not been linear during the mission , interpreted as a binary of longer period .",
    "when accounting for the orbital motion , using data from tokovinin ( 1992 ) , a new solution has been computed .",
    "the inclination angle @xmath14 is near @xmath15 so that the path on the sky is nearly linear .",
    "the proper motion of the barycentre is @xmath16 mas / yr instead of the published solution , @xmath17 mas / yr . strictly speaking , this is not a bias , since hipparcos measured the photocentre of the system , not the barycentre .    in both examples ,",
    "compared to the `` true '' value , the published solution is significantly different from what could be expected in the case of gaussian errors .",
    "although these examples are unfavourable cases , it must be pointed out that they were detected during the hipparcos data reduction .",
    "the same effects may also be present for some other stars where the binarity has not yet been detected , but this implies at the same time that the astrometric perturbation is smaller .",
    "the operation mode of the hipparcos satellite implied that the stars within a given small field were frequently observed together with the same complementary set of stars in the other field of view .",
    "this introduces correlations between the astrometric parameters of stars within some square degrees but , due to the rather low sky density of hipparcos , it is not a problem , except for open star clusters .",
    "this effect was studied before the satellite launch by lindegren ( 1988 ) and confirmed using the final results by lindegren ( 1997 ) and arenou ( 1997 ) .",
    "a special data reduction process had then to be used for cluster stars .",
    "this has been done in van leeuwen ( 1997a , b ) and robichon ( 1997 ) , and for this purpose the angular correlations have been calibrated , as detailed in van leeuwen & evans ( 1998 ) and robichon ( 1999 ) .",
    "although the correlation effect was known and taken into account , it was possibly not realized that , for a single realisation of a given cluster , this could mean a systematic error for the individual cluster members .",
    "it must however be remembered that the hipparcos data was reduced by two different consortia , and the systematic error is probably not the same for both , so that the merging of the two sets ( arenou , 1997 ) probably reduced the effect .    in order to illustrate this correlation",
    ", one may take the extreme example of ngc 6231 , where all 6 hipparcos stars have a negative parallax , whereas the photometric estimate is @xmath18 mas ( dambis , 1998 ) .",
    "a straight weighted average of individual parallaxes would give @xmath19 mas ; even taking into account the correlations , the mean cluster parallax is @xmath20 mas , which is still significantly different from the photometric estimate .",
    "apart from this extreme example , the question is whether the correlation effect has correctly been accounted for in the estimation of the hipparcos mean parallax of each cluster .",
    "although this is not easy to prove for one given cluster , an indirect statistical evidence may be obtained using a sample of distant clusters . to carry out this test ,",
    "clusters farther than 300 pc with at least 2 hipparcos members were used : 66 clusters in dambis ( 1998 ) catalogue and 102 clusters in loktin & matkin ( 1994 ) were found . concerning the latter , a 5% parallax relative error has been adopted .",
    "the mean photometric parallax error of these samples is about 0.04 mas , so that the comparison with hipparcos parallaxes shows mainly the hipparcos errors .",
    "the normalised differences between the mean hipparcos parallaxes , taking into account the angular correlations , and the photometric parallaxes are shown figure  [ histoamas ] .",
    "it appears that the small - scale systematic errors are 0 on the average , and the unit - weight about 1.15 .",
    "if the loktin & matkin distance moduli are corrected , taking into account the new hyades distance modulus ( 3.33 instead of 3.42 ) , the zero - point , the unit weight ( 1.17 ) and the asymmetry are reduced . since the cluster memberships have not been thoroughly investigated , the 15% underestimation of the formal error on hipparcos mean parallaxes seems to be an upper limit .",
    "pinsonneault ( 1998 ) suggested that a systematic error existed in the mean hipparcos parallax of the pleiades , due to the correlations between the right ascension and parallax , @xmath21 . for each star of the distant clusters ,",
    "the difference between hipparcos and dambis parallaxes is plotted figure  [ rhodamb ] as a function of @xmath21 .",
    "there are significant differences , due to some clusters ( ngc 6231 has a @xmath22 ) , but not a linear trend .    from these graphs , a 1 mas",
    "systematic error for the pleiades seems unlikely .",
    "we may thus assume for the following discussion that there is no significant systematic error in the hipparcos parallaxes , even at small - scale .",
    "the astrometric elements of a star are of not much interest in themselves for an astrophysical purpose . instead , the quantities of interest are the distance , the absolute magnitude , the radius , the age or the spatial velocity . given an observed parallax and proper motion , with its associated errors , unbiased estimates of these quantities are not easy to obtain .",
    "for instance , it has been shown by lutz - kelker ( 1973 ) that a sample selection based on the observed parallax relative error would introduce a bias on the mean absolute magnitude .",
    "in fact lutz - kelker considered that the bias occurs at each value of the parallax , but we will focus on sample selection only .",
    "this bias is due to :    * the non - linear relationship between absolute magnitude ( or distance , etc . ) and parallax , * the truncation based on the observed parallax , the true parallax distribution not being uniform .",
    "these two points are discussed below , and the influence of parallax errors is shown through the use of examples from the literature .",
    "it should be noted that what is true for the absolute magnitude is equally true for the other mentioned quantities .",
    "although obvious , it is worth remarking that @xmath23 so that the `` observed '' relative error suffers a bias , high dispersion and skewness proportional to those of the `` observed '' distance .",
    "the so - called lutz - kelker bias occurs because the random error present in the `` observed '' relative error is correlated with the error on the `` observed '' absolute magnitude .",
    "starting from a symmetric error law for the parallaxes , the error law on derived quantities such as distance or absolute magnitude looses this property . due to their non - linearity with respect",
    "to parallax , a bias is expected , and this is amplified by the fact that the corresponding estimates are not defined when the observed parallax is 0 or negative , leading to a rejection of such data .    given the true parallax @xmath24 , and assuming a gaussian law for the error on the observed parallax , @xmath25 , the expected bias of the `` observed '' distance @xmath26 in absence of any truncation is @xmath27 -{1\\over\\pi } & = & { 1\\over\\pi}{1\\over\\sqrt{2\\pi } } \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\left({1\\over{1+u\\spipi}}-1\\right ) e^{-{{u^2}\\over{2 } } } du \\label{biais}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the bias for the `` observed '' absolute magnitude @xmath28 is @xmath29 - m & = & { 5\\over{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty } \\log(1+u\\spipi)e^{-{{u^2}\\over{2 } } } du\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] apart from the fact that these integrals are not always defined , in both cases a bias will be present when @xmath30 is not negligible . assuming no truncation on negative or null parallaxes , and for small relative errors , the biases may be approximated by , respectively , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , negligible for relative errors smaller than , say , 10% .",
    "this bias is due to the asymmetry of the error distribution for @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and is what would still be present if an average of these quantities is computed ; other statistics ( based on the mode or the median ) would possibly give a result closer to the true value .",
    "for higher relative errors , the biases and variances are depicted as a function of the true relative error in brown ( 1997 ) , figure  1 and 2 for the distance and the absolute magnitude respectively .      whereas the bias due to the non - linearity would systematically happen ( but with a limited effect for small relative errors ) , the bias due to the truncation on the `` observed '' relative error , which is the major effect , could be avoided  if no truncation was done .",
    "an important part of studies in the recent literature based on hipparcos data have used a truncation procedure , usually based on the relative parallax error and sometimes rejecting only the negative parallaxes . in the hope of selecting only the most precise absolute magnitudes , not only their mean is biased , due to the lutz - kelker effect , but moreover the obtained precision on this mean is worse .    a simple  though extreme  simulation may help to understand this fact .",
    "we have randomly drawn magnitude - limited samples of 1000 stars ( e.g. rr - lyr ) of constant absolute magnitude=1@xmath35 with an uniform spatial distribution . thus , any bias will come from non - linearity and parallax truncation ] .",
    "these large samples contain on the average only 10 stars with `` observed '' relative error better than 30% , and the best weighted mean of the corresponding `` observed '' absolute magnitudes is @xmath36 , whereas using all stars and the estimate discussed in section  [ asymp ] , the mean absolute magnitude found is @xmath37 .",
    "if an unweighted mean had instead been used for the truncated sample , the bias would have reached 0.8 magnitudes .    in this example , the truncation on `` observed ''",
    "relative error gives a 30% systematic error , of the same amount as the mean error , which is itself 3 times greater than what would be obtained without truncation .",
    "the truncation thus appears as a perverse , and successful , way to obtain both biased and unprecise results .",
    "although the lutz - kelker effect is widely known , there seems however to be some confusion about its origin .",
    "since we know that the parallaxes are individually unbiased , the average value for a _ random _ sample of observed parallaxes will be the same as the average value of the underlying true parallaxes , with no bias @xmath38&=&\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty } { \\pi_{\\mathrm h}}f({\\pi_{\\mathrm h } } ) d{\\pi_{\\mathrm h}}=",
    "\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty } { \\pi_{\\mathrm h}}\\int_0^{+\\infty } f({\\pi_{\\mathrm h}}|\\pi ) f(\\pi )   d\\pi d{\\pi_{\\mathrm h}}\\nonumber\\\\   & = & \\int_0^{+\\infty } \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty } { \\pi_{\\mathrm h}}f({\\pi_{\\mathrm h}}|\\pi ) d{\\pi_{\\mathrm h}}f(\\pi ) d\\pi = \\int_0^{+\\infty } \\pi f(\\pi ) d\\pi = e[\\pi]\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the contrary , if a truncation is done on the observed parallax distribution ( integration of @xmath1 from some limit @xmath39 in the previous equations ) , there will be a bias .",
    "its value will depend on the parallax distribution : for a classical magnitude - limited sample , the measured parallax will be either too large or too small depending on whether the truncation is done on one side or another of the mode of the parallax distribution , as may be deduced from @xmath40 $ ] in equation  [ dyson ] .",
    "it must however be pointed out that @xmath40 $ ] is _ not _ the true parallax , but an estimate with also a dispersion .",
    "thus , a sentence like `` _ this statistical effect causes measured parallaxes to be too large _ '' ( oudmaijer et al . , 1997 ) is likely to mislead the reader .",
    "in fact , for one given star , few can be said when no other information than the observed parallax is available .",
    "let us consider for instance a star with observed parallax of , say , 3 mas , which belongs to two different samples ( e.g. with different limiting magnitude ) , the modes of the distributions of two samples being respectively at e.g. 2 mas and 4 mas : will the observed parallax expected to be too small or too large ?",
    "since the publication of the hipparcos catalogue , there have been numerous papers inferring from samples of hipparcos stars the properties of some populations , or comparing the new data with external data . in some cases",
    ", the effect of random errors may be misleading , and this is mainly due to the existing correlations between `` observed '' parallax relative errors , `` observed '' absolute magnitudes and `` observed '' distance .    a first example is taken from tsujimoto ( 1997 ) , where the absolute magnitudes of rr - lyr are calibrated .",
    "although the authors follow a rigorous statistical approach , their figure  2 may be misunderstood by the unaware reader . in this figure ,",
    "the `` observed '' absolute magnitude seems to go fainter with increasing ( true ) distance , the stars with `` observed '' parallax relative errors greater than 100% being systematically brighter .    what could be interpreted as a systematic error in the parallax is _",
    "exactly _ what is expected from parallaxes with random errors - and without systematic errors",
    ". a simulation of 174 distant stars , assuming a constant absolute magnitude = 1 , is shown figure  [ moto ] , excluding obviously those with a negative parallax .",
    "the magnitude dispersion increases with distance ( due to the increase of true parallax relative errors ) ; the errors bars become more and more asymmetrical , shifting some `` observed '' absolute magnitude towards the brightest end ; and a positive random parallax error implies both a fainter `` observed '' absolute magnitude and a smaller `` observed '' parallax relative error , producing the correlation between these two data .",
    "a second example is taken from oudmaijer ( 1998 ) , where the authors discuss the lutz - kelker effect and apply the correction to a sample of cepheids .",
    "they first compare the `` observed '' absolute magnitudes computed using ground - based parallaxes ( with a large random error ) to those computed with precise hipparcos parallaxes as a function of the ground - based parallax ( their figure  1 , lower panel ) .",
    "the authors do not seem to realise that the random errors are correlated and misinterpret this effect as being due to a `` _ completeness effect in the data _ '' .",
    "then , from a sample of 220 stars , only 26 stars are selected according to the `` observed '' parallax relative error .",
    "the difference between `` observed '' and true absolute magnitudes is plotted in their figure  4 .",
    "as expected , the same effect is present , and this is not due to missing faint stars : a volume - limited simulation will exactly reproduce the correlation effect .    their result in itself will not be further discussed here . as the authors quote , koen ( 1992 ) showed that for @xmath41 , the 90% confidence interval of the lutz - kelker correction could span over more than 1.77 magnitudes ! since almost all of the stars used by oudmaijer have a high parallax relative error one may however wonder how their result may be as precise as 0.02 mag .",
    "the two above examples illustrate the fact that the comparisons should always be done in the plane of the measured quantities ( the parallaxes ) , where the errors may safely be assumed symmetrical , and not in the plane of the derived quantities , where the effect of the random errors is not always clear .    in the following example , however ,",
    "although the comparison is done is the parallax plane , the effect of asymmetrical errors may be significant .",
    "the figure  2 from jahrei et al .",
    "( 1997 ) shows the differences between the hipparcos parallaxes and those deduced from photometric clla parallaxes ( carney et al . ,",
    "1994 ) versus the clla parallaxes .",
    "if there is a systematic shift of the photometric absolute magnitudes , then it should be seen as a slope in this graph , and the photometric parallaxes should be corrected by a factor ( 1+slope ) .",
    "this method could also provide an estimate of the hipparcos zero - point .",
    "although there is probably such an absolute magnitude zero - point error in that case , it should be pointed out that there are random errors ( assumed symmetrical ) in the calibrated photometric absolute magnitude , so both the resulting asymmetrical random error of the photometric parallaxes and the correlation between both axes may produce a similar effect ( lindegren , 1992 ) .",
    "the way random errors may mimic a systematic error is shown figure  [ jahr ] , where 275 stars have been simulated , assuming a constant density , a linear relation between colour and absolute magnitude , a 0.4 mag random error on absolute magnitude for the photometric estimate , and an observed parallax computed from the true absolute magnitude .    denoting @xmath42 the photometric parallax",
    ", the theoretical effect may been computed under the assumption of unbiased astrometric and photometric parallaxes : @xmath43= { { \\int_0^{+\\infty}{\\pi f({\\pi_{\\mathrm p}}|\\pi ) f(\\pi ) d\\pi}}\\over \\int_0^{+\\infty}{f({\\pi_{\\mathrm p}}|\\pi ) f(\\pi ) d\\pi}}-{\\pi_{\\mathrm p}}\\ ] ] assuming a gaussian law for the distribution of the error on the photometric absolute magnitude , with associated variance @xmath44 @xmath45 and assuming a magnitude - limited distribution for the true parallaxes , the shape of what may be expected from only the random errors only is shown in figure  [ jahr ] for different values of the random dispersion of the photometric parallaxes .    in summary ,",
    "if the random errors on the photometric absolute magnitude are not properly taken into account in the estimation procedure , one could wrongly deduce from such a graph both a systematic error of the absolute magnitude and a zero - point error on the trigonometric parallaxes .",
    "one can not however infer from this statement that there is no systematic error in the clla absolute magnitudes .",
    "any finite sample of stars is , by definition , limited in apparent magnitude . in some cases",
    "this limit can be ignored if there is another more constraining truncation , like a limit in @xmath46 . however ,",
    "if one wants to avoid as much as possible to introduce any censorship when constructing a sample of stars , one would be left with at least an apparent magnitude limit .",
    "it it thus important to understand the effects that such a truncation can have on the estimation of astrophysical quantities .",
    "the simplest case of an apparent magnitude truncation is the case of a sample with a clean apparent magnitude limit .",
    "this case was first studied by malmquist ( 1936 ) under some restrictive hypothesis :    * a gaussian distribution of the individual absolute magnitudes : @xmath47 * a uniform spatial distribution ( space density as @xmath48 ) .    under these two hypothesis the joint distribution of absolute magnitudes and distances of the base population has the shape depicted in figure  [ joint_1 ] . however , when the apparent magnitude limit @xmath49 is introduced this joint distribution is drastically changed , as depicted in figure  [ joint_2 ] .",
    "while the mean absolute magnitude of the base population is @xmath50 , the mean absolute magnitude of the truncated sample @xmath51 differs from this value , it is biased . thus , if one uses such a sample to estimate the absolute magnitude of the base population , even if the use of the trigonometric parallaxes is correct the value obtained will be biased .",
    "this bias in the mean absolute magnitude of a sample due to apparent magnitude truncation is known as the malmquist bias .",
    "malmquist ( 1936 ) calculated its value under the above cited hypothesis : @xmath52 there is , however , some confusion in the literature when using this correction . as pointed above ,",
    "the malmquist correction is valid under the two given hypothesis .",
    "if one of the two does not hold , the value of the malmquist bias may differ from eq .",
    "[ malmquist_formula ] .",
    "for instance , in the ( rather common ) case of an exponential disk spatial distribution the value of the malmquist bias depends on @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the scale height of the exponential disk ( luri , 1993 ) .",
    "an example is given in figure [ malmquist_z ] .",
    "thus , malmquist correction should not be blindly applied when an apparent magnitude truncation is present .",
    "the correction may vary depending on the absolute magnitude distribution and the spatial distribution of the base population .",
    "furthermore , if the apparent magnitude truncation is not clean - cut the effect will also be different .",
    "this is where the hipparcos survey may come handy .    on the other hand , as can be seen in figures [ joint_1 ] and [ joint_2 ] , the mean distance of the sample is also biased with respect to the base population .",
    "this can be important when studying the mean distance of a cluster , for instance .    finally , a further warning .",
    "all the discussion in this section has been centred in the case of a sample truncated _ only _ in apparent magnitude . in the case of combined truncations",
    "the joint effect should be analysed and taken into account .",
    "for instance , as pointed out above , a stringent truncation in @xmath46 ( e.g. 10% ) may eliminate the effects of the apparent magnitude truncation , but that may not be the case for a less stringent truncation ( e.g. 100% ) .",
    "since dyson - eddington ( 1926 ) , who corrected the observed parallax distribution in order to get the true absolute magnitude distribution , several methods have been used in order to get unbiased estimates of absolute magnitudes or distances . a first approach uses either a transformation of these quantities , or a correction of the biases .",
    "another approach uses all stars in order to give a smaller bias .",
    "finally a parametrical approach together with supplementary information fits a model to the observed quantities , taking explicitly into account the selection biases .",
    "the methods using a galaxy model and simulations ( e.g. bahcall & soneira , 1980 , or robin & crz , 1986 ) pertain in some sense to this latter approach but will not be discussed here .",
    "recently , smith & eichhorn ( 1997 ) have tackled the problem of distances derived from trigonometric parallaxes .",
    "assuming gaussian errors for the parallaxes , they demonstrate the presence of bias on the `` observed '' distance and the fact that its variance can be infinite . in this case",
    "it would be useless to do a bias correction .",
    "moreover the bias depends on the true parallax relative error , which is unknown .",
    "they propose two different methods , using either a transformation based on the observed parallax and its formal error , rendering a positive parallax , or a weighting of these parallaxes , eliminating the zero parallaxes .",
    "each method has advantages and disadvantages depending on whether the bias or the variance of the resulting estimate is considered .",
    "the other problem of the `` observed '' distance being its asymmetrical error law , kovalevsky ( 1998 ) has proposed a transformation which would give a gaussianized distance error law for small ( true ) parallax relative errors .",
    "it is however important to keep in mind the right use of these corrected distances .",
    "for instance , let us assume that we have to compare the distances deduced from hipparcos parallaxes to the distances deduced from ground - based parallaxes , in order to test if there is a systematic effect in one of the data sets . whereas the correct comparison would be in the plane of parallaxes , one perverse way to do it would be to compute for the two sets the `` observed '' distance , then to apply one of the above correction , and finally to obtain a comparison of distances where biases are unclear and where the high variance may prevent any safe conclusion ",
    "when one needs to obtain a mean parameter on a sample , such as a mean distance , mean absolute magnitude , etc , all parallaxes may in fact be used , instead of computing biased estimates for each star .",
    "concerning distance estimation , a simple example is the mean distance of a cluster , neglecting the cluster depth and assuming ( which is not the case for hipparcos ) that no correlation exists between individual parallaxes .",
    "two possible estimates , @xmath55 and @xmath56 would look at first sight equivalent . from equation  [ biais ] , however , the best of these two distance estimates is obvious : in the first case , the bias will still be present in the average since it occurs for each inverse of parallax , although it would be difficult to know its value since it depends on the true parallax relative error .",
    "whereas , in the second case , the precision of the mean parallax will be @xmath57 , so that the bias on the mean will be a factor @xmath58 smaller .",
    "asymptotically , the second estimate is thus unbiased and should be preferred over the first , since its variance is also smaller .",
    "although a bias will remain , it is in general very small compared to all the other uncertainties : typically , a cluster at 500 pc with only 9 hipparcos stars will have a distance bias smaller than 3% , whereas an average of individual distance could give a bias greater than 30% .",
    "concerning the mean absolute magnitude of a star sample , asymptotically unbiased estimates are also used at least since roman ( 1952 ) , and detailed in turon & crz ( 1977 ) .",
    "this method has recently been used by feast & catchpole ( 1997 ) or van leeuwen & evans ( 1998 ) using hipparcos intermediate astrometric data .",
    "the method is summarised at the end of this section .    however , this method concerns the mean absolute magnitude , not individual absolute magnitudes .",
    "the question is thus how to handle some individual stars with poor parallax relative precision . in general ,",
    "these absolute magnitudes are used in an h - r diagram , e.g. for age determination or luminosity calibrations .    instead of focusing on the absolute magnitude @xmath59 ,",
    "let us consider the quantity @xmath60 where the apparent magnitude @xmath61 has been corrected for extinction and the parallax is in arcsec ( or @xmath62 with @xmath24 in mas ) .",
    "missing a denomination for @xmath63 , we will refer in what follows to abl ( astrometry - based luminosity ) .",
    "the abl , the inverse of the square root of a flux , is much more easy to handle than the absolute magnitude when dealing with stars with a high parallax relative errors or even negative parallaxes ( i - e when the dispersion due to parallax random errors is much larger than the intrinsic dispersion of absolute magnitudes ) .    in a classical h - r diagram ,",
    "the absolute magnitude is plotted versus colour ; in what we call an `` astrometric '' h - r diagram , the abl is plotted versus colour . for illustration purposes ,",
    "a sample of 1000 stars of age 10 gy , with [ fe / h]=-1.4 and an 0.5 mag dispersion in absolute magnitude , has been simulated .",
    "no variations in metallicity or random errors in colours have been added .",
    "the classical h - r diagram for all stars with a 30% truncation on parallax relative error is represented on the left of figure  [ astrohr ] ( 116 stars ) .",
    "the so - called lutz - kelker effect appears clearly , showing the trend to get stars below the reference line , the true position of the stars being indicated by squares . since for each star the parallax relative error is not very large , the error bar asymmetry is not well seen .    using the abl ,",
    "the `` astrometric '' h - r diagram is represented on the right of figure  [ astrohr ] . for the sake of comparison",
    ", the same number of stars has been kept ; this has been obtained by using @xmath64 . in general , there is however no reason to reject the other stars , their high number compensates the greater error bars .",
    "consider for instance a program computing the age and metallicity for a sample of stars through interpolations between isochrones in an h - r diagram : the truncation effect on the parallax relative error may possibly bias the result . on the contrary , we could get unbiased and more precise estimates making use of the `` astrometric '' h - r diagram .",
    "another application concerns all the luminosity calibrations , the abl being calibrated as a function of photometric indices .",
    "the use of abl instead of absolute magnitude has the following advantages :    * the error bars on @xmath63 due to parallax errors are symmetrical * there is no lutz - kelker bias * all stars may be used , even those with negative parallaxes * the higher number of stars allows a gain in precision for mean values    coming back to the simple case where a mean absolute magnitude has to be computed from a sample of stars , and following jung ( 1971 ) or turon & crz ( 1977 ) , the first step is to estimate the best weighted mean abl for the sample @xmath65 or possibly a less precise but more robust estimate , then an asymptotically unbiased mean absolute magnitude is obtained with @xmath66 in the case where there is an intrinsic dispersion in absolute magnitude ( assumed small ) , it has to be taken into account in the weights of @xmath67 . as indicated above , all the stars may ( should ) be used , although a selection on @xmath68 may be applied . however , since this is a selection on luminosity , a malmquist - type bias should be accounted for .",
    "this may be also true for the whole sample .",
    "it must be pointed out that a symmetrical error in apparent magnitude will become asymmetrical in @xmath63 , thus causing a bias .",
    "however , given the good photometric precision of hipparcos , the bias coming from the errors in the apparent magnitudes is negligible and only the errors in the extinction correction may constitute a problem in some cases .",
    "the approaches described above make use only of the parallax in order to derive the distance or absolute magnitude .",
    "another approach makes use of all the available information : assuming some parametrical probability density functions ( pdf ) , a maximum likelihood estimation allows to find the optimal parameters corresponding to the studied sample . an early application of this method",
    "may be found in young ( 1971 ) , and in a more modern way by ratnatunga & casertano ( 1991 ) , arenou ( 1995 ) and luri ( 1996 ) .",
    "given the observables @xmath69 , the parameters @xmath70 being the coefficients of absolute magnitude as a function of colour , the galactic scale length and scale height , the velocity ellipsoid , etc , are estimated by maximising @xmath71 where each pdf @xmath72 takes into account a possible censorship , and are assumed to be independent ; typically @xmath73 is chosen gaussian around the true parallax , @xmath74 is a gaussian law for the absolute magnitude around the mean absolute magnitude , @xmath75 is the velocity ellipsoid , and @xmath76 is an exponential law in the galactic plane and in @xmath77 .",
    "the measurement error on apparent magnitude @xmath78 and extinction should be taken into account in @xmath74 , as for the proper motion @xmath79 or radial velocity @xmath80 in @xmath75 .",
    "an application to classical cepheids is given in a paper in this volume by luri ( 1998 ) .",
    "as a by - product , the distance and absolute magnitude may be estimated through e.g. the expectation : @xmath81=   { { \\int_0^{+\\infty } { 1\\over\\pi}g(\\obs|\\pi;\\theta)p(\\pi)d\\pi }   \\over h(\\obs;\\theta)}\\\\   \\widehat{m}&=&e[m+5 + 5\\log\\pi|\\obs;\\theta]=   m+5 + 5{{\\int_0^{+\\infty}{\\log\\pi}g(\\obs|\\pi;\\theta)p(\\pi)d\\pi }   \\over h(\\obs;\\theta)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the equations above use all the known information about one given star , and the parameters assumed for it , so that _ individual _ estimates of distance , absolute magnitude , etc , may be found , even e.g. if the concerned star has a zero or negative observed parallax . as for all bayesian estimations ,",
    "the drawback is of course that the laws must be adequate , otherwise the final result may be biased .    for completeness",
    ", it must be noted that there is one special case where an estimation may be used without any law for the true parallaxes , assuming only a gaussian error law for the random parallax errors , and making use only of the pdf of the observed parallaxes @xmath82 .",
    "this is the expectation of the true parallax given the observed parallax , a result found by dyson ( 1926 ) .",
    "the precision on the obtained estimate may be also be computed : @xmath83={\\pi_{\\mathrm h}}+   { \\sigma_{{\\pi_{\\mathrm h}}}}^2{{f'({\\pi_{\\mathrm h}})}\\over{f({\\pi_{\\mathrm h}})}}\\label{dyson}\\\\   \\sigma_{\\widehat{\\pi}}&= &    { \\sigma_{{\\pi_{\\mathrm h}}}}\\sqrt{1 + { \\sigma_{{\\pi_{\\mathrm h}}}}^2\\left({{f'({\\pi_{\\mathrm h}})}\\over{f({\\pi_{\\mathrm h}})}}\\right)'}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is in general smaller than @xmath84 for unimodal parallax distributions . a more detailed discussion on the estimation of the true parallax distribution may be found in lindegren ( 1995 ) .",
    "the hipparcos catalogue illustrates the various statistical problems one has to face when fundamental parameters have to be deduced from trigonometric parallaxes .",
    "the hipparcos errors may be considered gaussian , at least at large scales , with no noticeable bias . at small - scales ,",
    "the correlation effect between measurements must be taken into account .",
    "although the random parallax errors are symmetrical , with zero mean and dispersion as given by the formal error , a few outliers are however expected , e.g. due to binarity , in some rare cases .    the random errors may be misleading if improperly taken into account .",
    "in particular the transformation of parallaxes to distance or absolute magnitude should be done with caution .",
    "moreover , truncations based on the observed parallax should be avoided : although corrections to the induced bias exist , they have large confidence intervals .    in order to estimate distances and absolute magnitudes",
    "several methods may be used . either a transformation of the observed parallaxes , the use of asymptotically unbiased estimates , or a bayesian approach , which takes efficiently into account the selection biases , but which rely on laws .",
    "apart from its numerous astrophysical applications , one of the roles of the hipparcos catalogue will be to assess the validity of these pdfs .",
    "it will also assess the ground - based trigonometric parallaxes , which will expand our knowledge to fainter stars , until new spatial projects such as sim or gaia , are launched .",
    "in all cases , however , random measurement errors will still have to be taken into account .",
    "dr lindegren , who pointed out and described an effect similar to the one depicted figure  [ jahr ] is greatly acknowledged .",
    "we also thank dr kovalevsky who pointed to us an error in the jacobian of distance in luri & arenou ( 1997 ) leading to an incorrect figure  2 , and dr halbwachs who provided the spectroscopic orbital data .",
    "an extensive use has been made of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france , and of the base des amas ( mermilliod , 1995 ) .",
