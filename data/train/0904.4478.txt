    "the statistical properties of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation can be used to probe the very earliest stages of the universe s history , and provide valuable information on the mechanisms which ultimately gave rise to the existence of structure within the universe .",
    "this may include evidence for inflation , the process by which the rapid expansion of the universe is thought to have arisen . in standard inflationary models ,",
    "the fields in the early universe should be very close to random gaussian fields , so a detection of large non - gaussianity would be highly significant , and may indicate a different history , such as warm inflation or multiple - field inflation , or a completely different mechanism such as those arising from topological defects .",
    "a difficulty for methods designed to detect non - gaussianity in the cmb is that other processes can contribute , such as gravitational lensing , unsubtracted point sources , and imperfect subtraction of galactic foreground emission ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the challenge therefore is to provide evidence that any detection of non - gaussianity is primordial in origin , and not a result of these other effects .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide an optimised framework not just for detecting non - gaussianity , but for assessing the contributions from various sources .",
    "non - gaussianity from simplest inflationary models based on a single slowly - rolling scalar field is typically very small @xcite , ( see @xcite and references there in for more details ) .",
    "variants of simple inflationary models such as multiple scalar fields @xcite , features in the inflationary potential , non - adiabatic fluctuations , non - standard kinetic terms , warm inflation @xcite , or deviations from bunch - davies vacuum can all lead to much higher level of non - gaussianity",
    ". early observational work on the bispectrum from cobe @xcite and maxima @xcite was followed by much more accurate analysis with wmap @xcite . with the recent claim of a detection of non - gaussianity @xcite in the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe 5-year ( wmap5 ) sky maps , interest in non - gaussianity",
    "has obtained a tremendous boost .",
    "much of the interest in primordial non - gaussianity has focussed on a phenomenological ` _ local _",
    "@xmath0 ' parametrisation in terms of the perturbative non - linear coupling in the primordial curvature perturbation @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the linear gaussian part of the bardeen curvature and @xmath0 is the non - linear coupling parameter .",
    "a number of models have non - gaussianity which can be approximated by this form .",
    "the leading order non - gaussianity therefore is at the level of the bispectrum , or in configuration space at the three - point level .",
    "many studies involving primordial non - gaussianity have used the bispectrum , motivated by the fact that it contains all the information about @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it has been extensively studied @xcite , with most of these measurements providing convolved estimates of the bispectrum .",
    "optimised 3-point estimators were introduced by @xcite , and have been successively developed @xcite to the point where an estimator for @xmath0 which saturates the cramer - rao bound exists for partial sky coverage and inhomogeneous noise @xcite .",
    "approximate forms also exist for _ equilateral _ non - gaussianity , which may arise in models with non - minimal lagrangian with higher - derivative terms @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the largest signal comes from spherical harmonic modes with @xmath3 , whereas for the local model , the signal is highest when one @xmath4 is much smaller than the other two  the so - called _ squeezed _ configuration .",
    "reducing the cmb data to a single lossless estimate for @xmath0 is extremely elegant , but it suffers from the disadvantage that a single number loses the ability to determine the extent to which the estimate has been contaminated by non - primordial signals .",
    "what we seek to to perform a less aggressive data compression of the cmb data , not to a single number , but to a function , which has known expected form for primordial models , and for which the contributions from other signals can be estimated .",
    "the purpose of this is to be able to demonstrate that a non - gaussian signal is indeed primordial , or alternatively accounted for by non - primordial signals .",
    "we do this in a way which is still optimal for local or equilateral @xmath0 models , although the formalism is general .",
    "the function we choose is the integrated cross - power spectrum of pair of maps constructed from the cmb data .",
    "mathematically , it is closely related to previous estimators , but the interpretation of the output is different , and offers very significant advantages .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : section $ [ sec : infl_models ] provides a small review of available models of primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "section $ [ sec : cmb_bispec ] relates the projected - bispectrum to the corresponding primordial bispectrum .",
    "section $ [ sec : all_sky ] presents the optimised bispectrum - related power spectrum estimator for the idealised case of an all - sky survey with homogeneous noise .",
    "this is not optimal for partial sky coverage or inhomogeneous noise , but is straightforward and shows the connection with the @xmath0 estimator of @xcite .",
    "here we present the theoretical expectation for the local @xmath0 model , and show the link between the @xmath0 estimator based on one - point statistics and its two - point counterpart .",
    "section $ [ sec : part_sky ] provides a method which can handle partial sky coverage and non - uniform noise in an approximate way using monte - carlo simulations . in section $ [ sec : generalcase ] we provide the full optimal weights for bispectrum analysis in the presence of sky - cuts and the inhomogeneous noise .",
    "the full inverse - covariance of the data is introduced which makes the estimator an optimal one .",
    "the final section is devoted to discussion and future plans for numerical implementation .",
    "deviations from pure gaussian statistics can provide direct clues regarding inflationary dynamics .",
    "the single - field slow - roll model of inflation provides a very small level of departure from gaussianity , far below present experimental detection limits @xcite .",
    "many other variants however will produce a much higher - level of non - gaussianity which will be within the reach of all - sky experiments such as planck .    in general models",
    "can be distinguished by the way they predict coupling between different newtonian potential modes : @xmath5 the function f encodes the information about mode - mode coupling and @xmath6 ensures triangular equality in @xmath7-space .",
    "different models of inflation are typically divided into two different groups . the first class of model is known as the `` local model '' , where the contribution from @xmath8 is largest when the wavevectors are in the so - called `` squeezed '' configuration , where e.g. @xmath9 .",
    "the local form of non - gaussianity is predominant in models where there is non - linear coupling between the field driving inflation ( the inflaton ) and the curvature perturbations @xcite , such as the curvaton model @xcite and the ekpyrotic model @xcite .",
    "the primordial bispectrum in the local model can be written as : @xmath10 , \\ ] ] where the power spectrum of inflationary curvature perturbations is given by @xmath11 , in general for deviation from harrison - zeldovich power - spectra one has @xmath12 .",
    "the other main class consists of models where the contribution from @xmath8 is maximum for configurations where @xmath13 .",
    "the equilateral form appears from non - canonical kinetic terms such as dirac - born - infield ( dbi ) action ( alishahiha et .",
    "al . 2004 ) , the ghost condensation ( akrani - hamed et al . 2004 ) or various single - field models where the scalar field acquires a low sound speed @xcite .",

    "we will present a general analysis of secondary bispectra as well as the one induced by quasi - linear evolution of gravitational perturbations @xcite .",
    "the angular bispectrum can be defined as the three - point correlation in the harmonic domain . with temperature fluctuations as a function of solid angle @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and the three - point function",
    "may be written @xmath19 this form preserves the the rotational invariance of the three - point correlation function in the harmonic domain .",
    "the quantity in parentheses is the wigner 3j - symbol , which is nonzero only for triplets ( @xmath20 ) which satisfy the triangle rule , including that the sum @xmath21 is even , ensuring the parity invariance of the bispectrum .",
    "the reduced bispectrum @xmath22 was introduced by @xcite which will be helpful ( see @xcite for elaborate discussion ) : @xmath23 the reduced bispectrum @xmath22 can be expressed in terms of the kernel @xmath8 for various models that we will be considering : @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the transfer function which relates the inflationary potential @xmath26 to the spherical harmonics @xmath27 of the temperature perturbation in the sky ( e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath28 using these definitions one can express the reduced bispectra for the local and equilateral case as follows : @xmath29 \\\\ & & b_{l_1l_2l_3 } = 6 f_{nl}^{eq}\\int r^2 dr \\left [ -\\alpha_{l_1}(r ) \\beta_{l_2}(r ) \\beta_{l_3}(r ) - 2\\delta_{l_1}(r ) \\delta_{l_2}(r ) \\delta_{l_3}(r ) + \\beta_{l_1}(r)\\gamma_{l_2}(r ) \\delta_{l_3}(r ) + { \\rm cyc.perm . }",

    "we list the explicit expressions for the functions @xmath31 etc . for completeness @xcite : @xmath32 numerical evaluations of these functions can be performed by using the publicly available software such as camb or cmbfast .",
    "in this section , we compute the main statistic which will be used to estimate primordial non - gaussianity , and which can also be used to assess whether a non - gaussian signal is indeed primordial .",
    "we call the statistic the _ bispectrum - related power spectrum _ , as it derives from the cross - power spectrum of certain maps constructed from the cmb map data , and which , as we will see , is related to the primordial nongaussianity .",
    "the analysis in this section is optimal for detecting primordial non - gaussianity in the case of all - sky coverage and homogeneous noise .",
    "these assumptions will not hold in practice , but we present this simpler case for clarity first , and to show the connection with previous work .",
    "we relax the assumptions later , and give optimised estimators for realistic cases in later sections .      following @xcite",
    ", we first construct the 3d fields @xmath33 and @xmath34 from the expansion coefficients of the observed cmb map , @xmath27 .",
    "the harmonics here @xmath35 and @xmath36 are simply weighted spherical harmonics of the temperature field @xmath27 with weights constructed from the cmb power spectrum @xmath37 and the functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively : @xmath40 the function @xmath41 represents beam smoothing , and from here onward we will absorb it into the harmonic transforms . using these definitions @xcite define the one - point mixed - skewness for the fields @xmath42 and @xmath43 : @xmath44 @xmath45 can be used to estimate @xmath46 , but such radical data compression to a single number loses the ability to estimate contamination of the estimator by other sources of nongaussianity . as a consequence ,",
    "we construct a less radical compression , to a function of @xmath47 which can be used to estimate @xmath48 , but which can also be analysed for contamination by , for example , foregrounds .",
    "we do this by constructing the integrated cross - power spectrum of the maps @xmath33 and @xmath49 .",
    "expanding @xmath50 in spherical harmonics gives @xmath51 and we define the cross - power spectrum @xmath52 at a radial distance @xmath53 as @xmath54 integrating this over @xmath53 gives : @xmath55 this integrated cross power spectrum of @xmath49 and @xmath33 carries information about the underlying bispectrum @xmath56 , as follows : @xmath57 similarly we can construct the cross power spectrum of the product map @xmath58 and @xmath34 , which we denote as @xmath59 ; @xmath60 using these expressions , and the following relation , we can write this more compactly in terms of the estimated cmb bispectrum @xmath61 from which we compute our new statistic , the _ bispectrum - related power spectrum _ , @xmath62 as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the bispectrum for the local @xmath0 model , normalised to @xmath65",
    ". we can now use standard statistical techniques to estimate @xmath48 . note that",
    "if we sum over all @xmath47 values then we recover the estimator @xmath66 of @xcite , which is the cross - skewness of @xmath67 :    @xmath68    = 6 .",
    "cm    we show in fig .",
    "1 the form of the bispectrum - related power spectrum for the local model .",
    "if the signal observed is inconsistent with this form , it would indicate a departure from this form of primordial non - gaussianity , and/or a significant contamination by foreground sources . in the right hand panel",
    "we show the expected form of contamination of the @xmath62 statistic by a simple foreground source : unsubtracted point sources , randomly distributed .",
    "the contamination scales with the number density .",
    "this contamination is expected to be very low @xcite , but we show it as an illustration of how foreground effects may be detected . since its structure is very different from the local primordial signal , it should be relatively easy to decouple .",
    "note that the point source contamination here is the contribution to the local model bispectrum - related power spectrum - i.e. it is equation ( [ bips ] ) with one local @xmath69 and one point source @xmath69 ( constant @xmath22 ) , not two point source @xmath69 terms .",
    "the form for the reduced bispectrum for the equilateral model as mentioned above is an approximation to the real bispectrum generated in theories with higher - order derivatives in the lagrangian .",
    "in addition to the quantities @xmath70 and @xmath69 we have constructed analogous fields @xmath71 and @xmath72 with corresponding weights @xmath73 and @xmath74 : @xmath75 from these fields and using @xmath70 and @xmath69 previously defined a one - point statistic can be constructed @xcite : @xmath76.\\ ] ] the associated power spectrum will have a composite structure with many contributing terms . @xmath77 following the same procedure outlined above one can now write : @xmath78 and finally we can recover the one - point statistic or the cross - skewness of @xcite .",
    "@xmath79 individual contributions to the final skewness following relations , which can be useful diagonistics for numerical checks : @xmath80 given the signal - to - noise ratio of current estimates of @xmath45 or equivalently @xmath0 from wmap surveys , it may not be possible to use many narrow bins to evaluate the @xmath37s associated with the primordial bispectra .",
    "however , with the increase in experimental sensitivity of future cmb experiments , it will be possible to divide the @xmath47 range in narrower bins .",
    "the important point here is that the data must show consistency with the theoretical @xmath81 to make a convincing case that the non - gaussianity is primordial .",
    "however , these expressions are only optimal for all - sky coverage and homogeneous noise ; we relax these assumptions in the next sections .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that in the presence of partial sky coverage , e.g. due to the presence of a mask or because of galactic foregrounds and bright point sources , as well as , in the case of non - uniform noise , spherical symmetry is destroyed .",
    "the estimator introduced above will then have to be modified by adding terms linear in the observed map .",
    "the linear terms for the local model can be written in the following form : @xmath82 the linear terms therefore are constructed from correlating the monte - carlo ( mc ) averaged @xmath83 product maps with the input @xmath69 map .",
    "the mask and the noise that are used in constructing the monte - carlo averaged product map are exactly same as the observed maps and the ones derived from them such as @xmath70 or @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath84 mode - mode coupling is important at low angular modes , and we consider the full case later , but for higher frequency modes , we can approximate the linear correction to the local shape : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the sky fraction observed .",

    "likewise , the term @xmath89 denotes the average cross - correlation computed from mc averaging , of the product map constructed from the observed map @xmath90 multiplied with a mc realisation of map @xmath91 against the same mc realisation @xmath91 .",
    "@xmath92.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xcite showed via numerical analysis that the linear terms are less important in the equilateral case than in the local model .",
    "the use of such monte - carlo maps to model the effect of mask and noise greatly improves the speed compared to full bispectrum analysis .",
    "the use of linear terms was found to greatly reduce the scatter of the estimator , thereby improving its optimality .",
    "the estimator was used in @xcite also to compute the @xmath0 from combined @xmath93 and @xmath94 maps . the analysis presented above for both the one - point statistics and the power - spectral analysis is approximate , because it uses a crude @xmath86 approximation to deconvolve the estimated power spectrum to compare with analytical prediction .",
    "a more accurate analysis should take into account the mode - mode coupling which can dominate at low @xmath47 . the general expression which includes the mode - mode coupling will be presented in the next section .",
    "however it was found out by @xcite that removing low @xmath47s from the analysis can be efficient way to bypass the mode - mode coupling .",

    "a factor of @xmath98 can be introduced with the sum @xmath99 , if we choose not to introduce the @xmath97 normalization constant .",
    "this will make the estimator equivalent to the one introduced in the previous section .",
    "clearly as the data is weighted by @xmath100 , or the inverse covariance matrix , addition of higher modes will reduce the variance of the estimator .",
    "in contrast , the performance of sub - optimal estimators can degrade with resolution , due to the presence of inhomogeneous noise or a galactic mask .",
    "however , a wrong noise covariance matrix can not only make the estimator sub - optimal but it will make the estimator biased too . the noise model will depend on the specific survey scan strategy .",
    "numerical implementation of such inverse - variance weighting or multiplication of a map by @xmath101 can be carried out by conjugate gradient inversion techniques . taking clues from @xcite , we extend their estimators for the case of the bispectrum - related power spectrum .",

    "<S> we address the dual challenge of estimating deviations from gaussianity arising in models of the early universe , whilst retaining information necessary to assess whether a detection of non - gaussianity is primordial . </S>",
    "<S> we do this by constructing a new statistic , the bispectrum - related power spectrum , which is constructed from a map of the cosmic microwave background . </S>",
    "<S> the estimator is optimised for primordial non - gaussianity detection , but can also be useful in distinguishing primordial non - gaussianity from secondary non - gaussianity , such as may arise from unsubtracted point sources , or residuals from component separation . </S>",
    "<S> extending earlier studies we present unbiased non - gaussianity estimators optimised for partial sky coverage and inhomogeneous noise associated with realistic scan strategies , but which retain the ability to assess foreground contamination .    </S>",
