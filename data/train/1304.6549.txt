    "multi - phase - field approaches developed in the recent years were practically applied to the simulation of the three - phase transformation in eutectic and peritectic alloys .",
    "the wide range of such realistic microstructure studies was reported ( see the review article @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "however , the investigation of four- and multi - phase transformation reactions is not fully covered .",
    "one of the reason is the complexity of the models and the emerging challenges in terms of the understanding of multi - phase interactions .    in the last decade ,",
    "two main concepts of the multi - phase modelling have been established .",
    "the first one is the multi - phase concept of steinbach , which considers the change of any phase @xmath1 as the sum of other phase contributions due to the interaction between the phase @xmath1 and other phases on all individual interfaces , whereas the interaction between more than two phases are neglected .",
    "therefore , the kinetic of individual interfaces can be considered separately with different interface energies and mobility parameters @xcite . the physical constraint on phase fields , that the sum of all phase fields is equal to one ,",
    "is kept in this model automatically .",
    "the main works in this area are @xcite , where the main focus is the coupling of the kinetic equations to the diffusion equations in the multi - component systems .",
    "the second concept supposes that the physical constraint on phase fields can be resolved by the formal application of the method of lagrange multipliers to the free - energy functional , it works as the geometric projection of the driving force vector onto the plane of constraint .",
    "the main representatives of this concept are folch and plapp@xcite .",
    "they developed a qualitative phase - field model for three phases with a smooth designed model function in the free energy functional that should ensure the stability of the solution and the absence of `` ghost '' phases on the interfaces between two phases . in this model the equations of motion for each interface can be mapped to the standard phase - field model of pure substances , where the thin - interface asymptotic analysis was applied @xcite .",
    "moreover , it exploits the idea of second order expansion of the free energy functional@xcite , that simplifies the structure of the phase - field equations .",
    "later , in the work of kundin and siquieri @xcite , the total free energy functional proposed by folch and plapp was extended by using different thermodynamic factors of phases , whereas the evolution of the phase field was modeled according to the multi - phase concept of steinbach .",
    "then the model was refined by the inclusion of cross terms in the thermodynamic factor matrix in multi - component systems @xcite . the same authors @xcite applied the original model of folch and plapp to investigate the kinetics and morphology of the eutectic growth , where the difference in the thermodynamic factors was taken into account , too .",
    "they also shown that the nucleation of new lamellae on the boundary of the partner solid phase is rather an physical phenomena than an `` artifact '' of the model and the probability of this nucleation is defined by the the undercooling and the surface tension that is in agreement with the classical nucleation theory .",
    "the second concept was further exploited in the field of multicomponent alloy solidification @xcite .",
    "the authors used the lagrange multiplier method and wrote the model in common form leaving out of consideration the stability requirements . to prevent the existence of the third phase on the individual interfaces the authors added the third order term to the obstacle potential which hardly can be applied in more general cases .",
    "moreover , no thin - interface analysis of such models is available .",
    "an intermediate approach between the first and second concept was proposed , which combines the different interface kinetics with the formal account for the change of the all phases in the multiple junctions @xcite . in the study",
    "@xcite it was shown that the reformulated model predicts the angles between the phases close to the analytical values except of small deviation in the 3d simulations .",
    "but by that approach the authors can not overcome the criticism of folch and plapp about the instability of the solution for the chosen model functions @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we use the method of lagrange multipliers and the idea of flatness and stability for model functions suggested by folch and plapp @xcite and then extend it to the @xmath0-dimensional phase - field model ( see section [ section_formulation ] ) .",
    "we construct the phase - field model functions step by step and show the implementation of different interface energies and mobility parameters for each individual interface .",
    "the numerical tests presented in section [ test_young ] were carried out to show how the model fulfills young s law and how the mobility parameters influence the dynamic evolution of the corresponding individual interfaces . in section [ al - cu - ni ]",
    "we verify the model by the qualitative simulations of the solidification in an al - cu - ni alloy with a four - phase transformation reaction . in this section",
    "we explained the physics of four - phase solidification and write a full system of the model equations .",
    "we present the numerical simulations of the microstructure evolution and show the nucleation effects which can be observed .",
    "finally , in conclusion we shortly summarize the main result of this paper .",
    "we assume that our physical system can be fully described by @xmath0 phase fields @xmath2 $ ] , @xmath3 and by @xmath4 concentration fields @xmath5 $ ] , @xmath6 .",
    "we identify a vector of phase fields as @xmath7 , where every phase field @xmath8 means the volume fraction of @xmath1-th phase .",
    "therefore , we demand that in every time our system should follow the physical constraint , that is the sum of all phase fields should be equal to one @xmath9    the total free energy functional of the system is written as @xmath10 where a total free energy density is expanded into the following terms @xmath11 here , @xmath12 sets a free energy cost depending on gradients of phase fields , forcing interfaces to have finite width .",
    "a constant @xmath13 has the dimension of energy per unit length and a constant @xmath14 has the dimension of energy per volume .",
    "@xmath15 is a dimensionless barrier function , which is analog to the double well potential in the theory for two phases .",
    "@xmath16 has the dimension of energy per volume and is the chemical part of the free energy which depends on concentration vector @xmath17 and the temperature @xmath18 .    for the evolution equations we chose model c according to the classification given in ref .",

    "get the projection of driving force onto the gibbs simplex @xmath23\\}$ ] .",
    "this automatically ensures @xmath24 .      the first formulation of stability and flatness requirements for free energy model functions was made by folch and plapp in @xcite as @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively . in the following",
    ", we will use requirements which are equivalent to folch and plapp @xcite in three dimensional phase - field space but weaker in general @xmath0-dimensional space .",
    "namely , we require on all interfaces @xmath27 the stability condition @xmath28 and the flatness condition @xmath29 and analogical conditions on vertexes @xmath30 @xmath31    we start the construction of model functions with choosing the free energy gradient term in the form @xmath32 it is easy to check that @xmath33 satisfies the flatness conditions ( [ flatness1]),([flatness2 ] ) . and the flatness requirement is the main reason why we are limited to such simple form ( [ fg ] ) .    then , we construct the barrier function @xmath34 in such a way that we have an arbitrary positive interface energy @xmath35 for any individual interface @xmath36 .",
    "moreover , @xmath34 should satisfy our stability and flatness conditions ( [ stability1]-[flatness2 ] ) . for this aim",
    "we define a set of barrier functions @xmath37 it is the polynomial of minimum power which follows stability and flatness conditions and @xmath38 @xmath39 . also if @xmath40 and @xmath41 , @xmath42 , then @xmath43 .",
    "finally , we can represent @xmath44 where @xmath45 will provide us the surface energy @xmath35 for each individual interface @xmath36 .    to determine constants @xmath45 we should consider the evolution equation of phase fields ( [ eqlagrangemulti ] ) on an interface @xmath36 . using ( [ stability1]-[flatness2 ] )",
    "it can be shown that only @xmath1-th and @xmath46-th component of driving force are non zero .",
    "then , taking into account that all terms @xmath47 on @xmath36 except @xmath48 , we will see that only @xmath48 has a contribution in eq .",
    "( [ eqlagrangemulti ] ) .",
    "analogically we can analyze the @xmath33 term .",
    "therefore , without the chemical free energy term @xmath16 we can write for the static solution of eq .",
    "( [ eqlagrangemulti ] ) @xmath49 in equilibrium the total free energy will turn to @xmath50 where we use only one dimension for the sake of simplicity .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eqstatic ] ) can be expressed as @xmath51.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] then we have @xmath52 and can express the surface energy as @xmath53 then , @xmath45 can be written as @xmath54 and we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ fb ] ) as @xmath55 then constants @xmath14 and @xmath13 can be determined through a model interface width @xmath56 and a maximal interface energy @xmath57 .",
    "that is @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "using the above definitions we can write the barrier function as @xmath60 therefore in our model we have different numerical interface widths @xmath61 . if we change the interface energies @xmath35 , then each particular interface width @xmath62 will be changed automatically .",
    "we can also change the model interface width @xmath63 in accordance to the need of the numerical method .",
    "finally , we construct model functions @xmath64 which will be used in the formulation of @xmath16 .",
    "these functions should be equal to one on a vertex @xmath65 and 0 on other vertexes .",
    "they also should satisfy stability and flatness requirements ( [ stability1]-[flatness2 ] ) .",
    "then we add a condition @xmath66 for @xmath40 , which comes from the thin - interface analyses .    we have found the model functions as polynomials of minimal power @xmath67 on all individual interfaces @xmath36 the functions @xmath68 reduce to @xmath69 by taking into account the constraint @xmath70 .    to construct model functions @xmath71 ( 12 ) and @xmath72 ( 23 ) in @xmath0 dimensional phase - field space we suggest to reduce the flatness ( 7 - 10 ) requirement to finite number of conditions .",
    "therefore we assume that all our model functions should be respective symmetric polynomials of minimal power , where the symmetry is taken only such @xmath73 , that @xmath74 for @xmath68 and @xmath75 for @xmath48 .",
    "we used the fundamental theorem for symmetric polynomial .",
    "that is , for every fixed power @xmath76 of polynomials @xmath68 and",
    "@xmath48 we can represent them as finite expansion in terms of basic symmetric polynomials of power @xmath77 . due to the symmetry of respective derivatives we write lagrange multiplier in a finite form .",
    "then , from the flatness conditions ( 7 - 10 ) we get just a few equations instead of an undetermine number @xmath0 . thus solving the linear system of equations for respective coefficients of expansion",
    ", we were able to find @xmath68 and @xmath48 which satisfy all requirements ( 7 - 10 ) .      here",
    ", we propose a system mobility parameter @xmath78 which takes constant values @xmath79 on any individual interface @xmath36 and smoothly varies on the gibbs simplex @xmath76 and in neighborhood .",
    "the use of the mobility parameter @xmath80 allows to consider any immobile interface @xmath36 with a mobility parameter equal to zero @xmath81 instead of a relaxation time going to infinity @xmath82 .",
    "let us identify a distance @xmath83 between a point inside the gibbs simplex @xmath76 and an interface @xmath36 as @xmath84 then we can write the mobility parameter of the system as a function of @xmath83 in the form @xmath85 the result is plotted in fig .  1 , where it can be seen that the function ( [ eqtau ] ) has prime lines on each dual interface as local minima .",

    "we identify an equilibrium composition vector as @xmath93 with components @xmath94 and equilibrium chemical free energies of phases @xmath95 .",
    "these parameters can be defined by the common plane construction to the free energy functions of individual phases . if there are more then one equilibrium composition for a phase @xmath1 with respect to all other phases @xmath96 we will take a mean value of them .    for the definition of the driving force of the phase transformation",

    "we found that both systems have the same dynamic evolution with a good accuracy as it was expected . in the static equilibrium we got in the three - phase junction angles of 120@xmath134 with a high accuracy , which satisfies the young s law .",
    "we can also see clearly in these figures that the numerical interface widths are constant and we do not have `` ghost '' phases on each individual interface .    in fig .",
    "4 the dynamic of triple points is shown for tests 1 and 2 .",

    "[ fig2 ]    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     notice that we can insert a nuclei arbitrary on a solid / liquid interface and the nucleation will occur if the driving force for the nucleation is large enough .",
    "but in the present model the nucleation occurs at the right place and at the favorable energetic conditions .",
    "moreover , the additional terms in the model allow to reduce or increase the nucleation barrier , in particular the barrier can be increased in the triple point and prevent the nucleation of the fourth phase in this points as it was shown in numerical tests above .",
    "in this work we have formulated a general phase - field model in @xmath0-dimensional phase - field space .",
    "the main point of the model is a spatial constructed smooth total free energy functional for an arbitrary number of phases which satisfies the requirements of the stability and flatness on all individual interfaces and vertexes . for this aim",
    "the special model functions being responsible for the interface energy barrier and for the chemical driving force of the transformation are proposed which satisfy these requirements and allow to take into account the anisotropy of the interface energies and mobility parameters .",
    "the ability of the model to follow the young s law and the dynamics of the system evolution is tested by the investigation of the phase - field interactions at the interfaces and the multiple junctions .",
    "it was found that the nucleation of new phases can be controlled by the additional terms in the phase - field evolution equations .",
    "the applicability of the model to multicomponent and multiphase systems was verified by the quantitative simulation of the microstructure evolution in a ternary al - cu - ni alloy in the presence of the four - phase peritectic - like reaction .",
    "it was shown that after the four - phase reaction the three - phase reaction occures and a morphology similar to the lammelar structure is developed .",
    "furthermore , the type of morphology and growth rate of the crystals can be controlled by the thermal noise term added to the phase - field evolution equation .    in our future work",
    "the presented model will be used for the investugation of the microstructure evolution for various alloy compositions during cooling with various cooling rates and temperature gradients .",
