    "soft - hadronic observables measured in the relativistic heavy - ion experiments are well reproduced by perfect - fluid hydrodynamics or by viscous hydrodynamics with a small viscosity to entropy ratio @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the use of such approaches at the very early stages of the collisions encounters conceptual difficulties .",
    "thermalization times shorter than a fraction of a fermi ( used in the perfect - fluid approaches ) can not be explained within microscopic models of the collisions . on the other hand , viscous hydrodynamics",
    "is based on an implicit assumption that one can make an expansion around an isotropic background .",
    "if the shear correction is large , a new framework incorporating large momentum - space anisotropies into the leading order of the approximation may be useful .",
    "such a new approach has been introduced in @xcite and we refer to it below as to the _ anisotropic hydrodynamics_.",
    "anisotropic hydrodynamics is based on the equations @xmath0 which express the energy - momentum conservation and entropy production laws . the energy - momentum tensor @xmath1 has the structure @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the longitudinal pressure and @xmath4 is the transverse pressure . in the limit @xmath5 ,",

    "similarly , the entropy production law ( [ engrow ] ) is reduced to the entropy conservation law , if we take @xmath6 .",
    "the four - vector @xmath7 describes the flow of matter , while @xmath8 defines the beam ( @xmath9 ) axis . in the general case ,",
    "we use the parameterizations @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the transverse components of the four - velocity field and @xmath14 is the longitudinal fluid rapidity .",
    "the entropy flux @xmath15 equals @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the non - equilibrium entropy density .",
    "one can show @xcite that instead of @xmath3 and @xmath4 it is more convenient to use the entropy density @xmath17 and the _ anisotropy parameter _ @xmath18 as two independent variables ( one may use the approximation @xmath19 ) .",
    "similarly to standard hydrodynamics with vanishing baryon chemical potential , the energy density @xmath20 , the entropy density @xmath17 , and the anisotropy parameter @xmath18 are related through the _ generalized _ equation of state @xcite @xmath21 , \\label{pt2b }    \\\\",

    "we use the form proposed in @xcite @xmath30 where the time - scale parameter @xmath31 controls the rate of equilibration . in this work",
    "we use the constant value @xmath31 = 1 fm . in refs .",
    "@xcite the medium dependent @xmath31 was used , which was inversely proportional to the typical transverse momentum scale in the system . if a constant value of @xmath31 is used , the system approaches the perfect fluid behavior for @xmath32 .    in the limit of small anisotropy eq .",
    "( [ entropys ] ) is consistent with the quadratic form of the entropy production in the israel - stewart theory @xcite .",
    "far from equilibrium , hints for the form of @xmath29 are lacking , although we may expect some suggestions from the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "thus , for large anisotropies the formula ( [ entropys ] ) should be treated as an assumption defining the dynamics of the system .",

    "we fix the initial starting time to @xmath36 fm . similarly to other hydrodynamic calculations , we assume that there is no initial transverse flow , @xmath37 and that the initial longitudinal rapidity of the fluid is equal to space - time rapidity , @xmath38 . in this text",
    "we present the results for two scenarios : i ) the initial source is strongly _ oblate _ in momentum space , @xmath39 , and ii ) the source is _ prolate _ in momentum space , @xmath40 ; the latter value is chosen since @xmath41 .",

    "the model results describing the pseudorapidity distributions , transverse - momentum spectra , the elliptic and directed flow coefficients , and the hbt radii have been obtained with different initial anisotropies of pressure ; @xmath54 ( dashed blue lines ) and @xmath55 ( dotted green lines ) . in all of the considered cases we find good agreement between the model results and the data . moreover , we find that the results obtained with different initial anisotropies are practically the same .",

    "a larger ( smaller ) initial energy density is used for the initially prolate ( oblate ) system .",

    "our results indicate that the final hadronic observables are not sensitive to the early anisotropy of pressure .",
    "the flows are built up during the whole time evolution of the system , hence the relatively short early anisotropic stage does not influence the results . in our opinion",
