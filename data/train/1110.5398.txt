    "the discovery and determination of properties of new particles beyond the standard model at high - energy colliders depends on accurate knowledge of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the hadrons involved in the collisions . with the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern now taking data at unprecedentedly high energies , the effort to control backgrounds in searches for the higgs boson and other putative particles is taking on paramount urgency .",

    "has also been discussed recently in fixed - target experiments , particularly for the @xmath3 quark distribution in the region of large parton momentum fractions @xmath2 ( @xmath9 ) @xcite . because both proton and deuterium deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) data are required to constrain the @xmath3 quark pdf , uncertainties in the nuclear corrections in the deuteron at large @xmath2 translate into significant and growing uncertainties on the @xmath10 ratio as @xmath11 . through @xmath12 evolution , this can impact cross section calculations at smaller @xmath2 and larger @xmath12 @xcite , especially in regions where the rapidity is large .",
    "in addition to higgs boson cross sections , other processes studied at the lhc or the tevatron at fermilab that may be sensitive to pdf uncertainties include the production of heavy @xmath4 and @xmath5 bosons associated with additional su(2)@xmath13u(1 ) gauge groups",
    ". these are predicted in various extensions of the standard model , such as the so(10 ) and e@xmath14 grand unified theories , or supersymmetric models , some with @xmath4 and @xmath5 boson masses at the tev scale ( for reviews see , _ e.g. _ , refs .",
    "their production cross sections at large rapidities will involve products of pdfs evaluated with one value of @xmath2 small and the other large , thereby exposing them to uncertainties in pdfs at large @xmath2 , particularly near the kinematic limits .    in this paper",

    "the cj analysis @xcite was a dedicated global nlo fit of proton and deuteron dis and other high - energy scattering data , which critically examined the effects on pdfs of nuclear corrections in the deuteron @xmath18 structure function .",
    "nuclear corrections were estimated using a smearing function computed within the weak binding approximation @xcite , taking into account nuclear binding and fermi motion , as well as a range of models describing the possible modification of the nucleon structure function off - shell @xcite .",
    "several deuteron wave functions were considered , based on high - precision nucleon ",
    "nucleon potentials , including the nonrelativistic cd - bonn @xcite and av18 @xcite wave functions , and the relativistic wjc-1 and wjc-2 wave functions @xcite , as well as the older paris @xcite wave function for reference .",
    "the off - shell corrections were estimated from a relativistic quark spectator model @xcite , and from a phenomenological model proposed by kulagin & petti @xcite but modified for the specific case of the deuteron ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "combinations of deuteron wave functions and off - shell models giving the smallest and largest nuclear effects were identified , and used to define the range of the nuclear corrections from the minimum ( wjc-1 wave function and no off - shell corrections ) to the maximum ( cd - bonn wave function and largest off - shell corrections ) nuclear corrections .",
    "the central values , which are used as a reference , were obtained using the av18 wave function and an intermediate off - shell correction .",
    "the resulting fitted @xmath10 quark distribution ratio is shown in fig .",

    "significant uncertainties appear also in the gluon pdf in the region of @xmath2 not directly constrained by data , as well as in the @xmath21 and @xmath22 distributions due to correlations with the @xmath3 quark , induced in the global fits by moderate-@xmath2 jet and dilepton production data , respectively .",
    "several experiments to directly measure @xmath10 up to @xmath23 are planned at the 12  gev energy upgraded jefferson lab in the near future @xcite , which it is hoped will reduce the uncertainties significantly .",

    "in this section we discuss the effects of pdf uncertainties at large @xmath2 on the @xmath0 and @xmath1 boson cross sections , and possible constraints on these obtained from measurements at large rapidities .",
    "earlier studies probing the sensitivity of weak boson production to pdf uncertainties were explored in refs .",
    "the discussion here is not meant to provide an exhaustive account of detailed aspects of @xmath0 boson production , but simply highlight the fact that nuclear corrections in deuterium are an important source of pdf uncertainty at large @xmath2 that has not been addressed in earlier analyses . to begin with we",
    "shall review the general formulas for the inclusive weak boson production cross sections in hadronic collisions relevant to current collider experiments .",

    "the enhancement of the @xmath40 cross section at large @xmath70 for the cj pdfs with maximum nuclear corrections , and corresponding suppression of the cj pdfs with minimum nuclear corrections , relative to the central cj fits essentially follows the trend of the @xmath3 quark pdf in fig .",

    "each parametrization shows good agreement with the tevatron cdf data , with the exception of the abkm fit , which overestimates the asymmetries at intermediate rapidities , @xmath85 .",

    "[ fig : w_asym ] , and the combined spread between them would subsequently be significantly larger .",

    "the limited sensitivity of the lepton asymmetries to large-@xmath2 pdfs is not surprising , given that the lepton asymmetry is computed by convoluting the @xmath0 boson cross sections with the @xmath0 boson decay distributions , which dilutes the sensitivity to regions where the pdfs are small .",
    "although the lepton asymmetry data are clearly valuable for constraining global pdf fits in general , greater sensitivity to the large-@xmath2 behavior of the @xmath10 ratio may be possible through the reconstruction of the @xmath0 boson asymmetries themselves .",
    "note , however , that the reconstruction of @xmath0 boson asymmetries is limited by theoretical uncertainties such as the modeling of the @xmath105 distributions and higher - order resummation corrections ( which also affect the lepton asymmetries ) , as well as the choice of pdfs used to compute the event reweighting coefficients in the reconstruction .",
    "the production rate of any new heavy boson beyond the standard model will naturally depend on its internal properties such as the spin .",
    "many possibilities have been canvassed for how such heavy bosons can arise @xcite , including as scalar excitations in @xmath106-parity violating supersymmetry @xcite , spin-1 kaluza - klein excitations of standard model gauge bosons in the presence of extra dimensions @xcite , or as spin-2 excitations of the graviton @xcite . on the other hand ,",

    "this is not surprising given that total cross sections are dominated by contributions from low values of @xmath122 , where the pdf uncertainties are generally smaller than at high values of @xmath122 , at which the contributions are suppressed by the steeply falling pdfs as @xmath11 . at larger @xmath125 values",

    "[ fig : ywz ] is mostly washed out in the integrated cross section .    because the @xmath4 cross sections in @xmath7 collisions at the tevatron are determined by the products @xmath147 and @xmath153 for @xmath135 and @xmath136 , respectively , integrating over rapidity samples all accessible values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , so that the total @xmath135 and @xmath136 cross sections are equivalent .",

    "in this paper we have explored the sensitivity of weak boson production in hadronic collisions to parton distributions at large values of @xmath2 . at present",
    "there are large uncertainties in the @xmath3 quark distribution , particularly above @xmath20 , arising from the model dependence of nuclear corrections used when analyzing deuteron dis data in global pdf fits , which can impact cross section measurements at large rapidities .",
    "the pdf uncertainties can also affect production cross sections of heavy @xmath4 and @xmath5 bosons beyond the standard model at central rapidities .",
    "using pdfs extracted from the recent cj global fit @xcite , we find increasing sensitivity to the large-@xmath2 region for @xmath1 boson production in @xmath154 collisions at the tevatron for @xmath1 rapidities @xmath172 , and in @xmath6 collisions at the lhc for @xmath173 .",
    "precision measurements of @xmath1 boson cross sections at these rapidities , at the tevatron and particularly at the lhc with the lhcb experiment , will be required to impact global fits of the @xmath3 quark and constrain nuclear model uncertainties .    for charged weak bosons ,",
    "the @xmath36 cross sections are mostly independent of pdf uncertainties due to their preferential coupling to @xmath19 quarks , whereas the @xmath40 cross sections display strong dependence on the @xmath3 quark uncertainties for @xmath0 rapidities @xmath174 at tevatron and @xmath75 at lhc kinematics .",
    "measurements of @xmath0 boson charge asymmetries at large rapidities , such as those from the cdf collaboration at fermilab @xcite , thus provide strong constraints on the behavior of the @xmath10 ratio at large @xmath2 , although such measurements are very challenging given the low rates expected in the relevant regions of kinematics .",
    "direct reconstruction of @xmath0 boson asymmetries in the lhcb experiment for @xmath114  tev would also be extremely valuable in providing access to pdfs at @xmath175 .",
    "we have also compared charged lepton asymmetries with data from d0 @xcite , and from the cms @xcite and lhcb collaborations @xcite at the lhc , finding good overall agreement with the cj pdfs , but weak sensitivity to large-@xmath2 pdfs .",
    "the large-@xmath2 pdf uncertainties also affect the production rates of heavy @xmath4 and @xmath5 bosons , and the impact of these was studied as a function of the boson mass for standard model couplings . at high rapidity ,",
    "the @xmath135 cross section in @xmath6 and @xmath7 collisions is mostly sensitive to the @xmath19 quark pdf at large @xmath2 and therefore well constrained .",
    "the @xmath5 cross section displays a mild sensitivity to the @xmath3 quark pdf at large @xmath2 , reaching upwards of 40% uncertainty at the kinematic rapidity limit .",
    "the effects are even more pronounced for @xmath136 cross sections , where the uncertainties exceed 100% at large @xmath70 .    at central rapidity the @xmath5 cross section is well constrained , with weak sensitivity to @xmath21 and @xmath22 quarks at the lhc for @xmath158  tev . the @xmath4 central rapidity cross sections , on the other hand , display sensitivity to large-@xmath2 pdfs of the order @xmath176 for @xmath177  tev at the lhc ( due to @xmath22 and @xmath21 ) and 0.75  tev at the tevatron ( due again to @xmath3 quarks ) .",
    "the uncertainties at central rapidity directly propagate to the integrated cross sections , which show @xmath157 effects for @xmath5 production , while somewhat larger for @xmath4 production , amounting to @xmath178 for @xmath135 and @xmath179 for @xmath136 at the lhc for @xmath180  tev , and @xmath181 for @xmath135 and @xmath136 at the tevatron for @xmath182  tev .",
    "these considerations place important limits on the ability to accurately measure heavy @xmath4 and @xmath5 cross sections in hadronic collisions , particularly at large rapidities and boson masses near the kinematic thresholds of current colliders .",
    "although our analysis is , for illustration , restricted to heavy vector bosons with standard model couplings , and the quantitative effects of the pdf uncertainties would be different in other models , our main point is that caution must be exercised when using pdfs in regions where these are not directly constrained , or their uncertainties underestimated , as is the case at large @xmath2 .",
    "the uncertainties in the production cross sections can be reduced by obtaining better constraints on pdfs at large @xmath2 , especially for the @xmath3 quark .",
    "several experiments aimed at determining the @xmath3 quark pdf up to @xmath23 are planned at jefferson lab following its 12  gev energy upgrade @xcite .",
    "uncertainties in cross sections at central rapidity , and hence in the integrated cross sections , will also be reduced with improved determinations of antiquark distributions at large @xmath2 , such as the e-906/seaquest experiment at fermilab @xcite which plans to measure @xmath183 up to @xmath184 .",
    "the flavor dependence of weak boson production could also be studied with @xmath185 collisions at the lhc or at the relativistic heavy - ion collider , with the neutron provided by a beam of deuterons @xcite . unlike for fixed target experiments ,",
    "in a collider one can study @xmath186 collisions at large positive and negative rapidities .",
    "therefore , partons in the beam at large @xmath27 can scatter from partons in the target at small @xmath28 , and vice versa .",
    "in particular , measurements at large negative rapidity would be sentitive to quarks in the deuteron at large momentum fractions , offering a probe of nuclear corrections complementary to deuterium dis , and constraining the nuclear uncertainties studied in this paper .",
    "finally , while we have focussed on the @xmath57  tev energy at which the lhc currently operates , in future this is planned to increase to @xmath187  tev .",
    "the behavior of the cross sections illustrated here will not change qualitatively at the larger energy .",
    "however , for physical @xmath0 and @xmath1 bosons , the region in rapidity where sensitivity to nuclear models is greatest will be shifted outside of the acceptance of current experiments , limiting the usefulness of 14  tev data for large-@xmath2 pdf studies . on the other hand ,",
    "the higher center of mass energy will increase the accessible @xmath170 mass range ( up to @xmath188  tev ) over a larger range of rapidities .",
