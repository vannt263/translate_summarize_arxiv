    ", we neglect the helical structure , and instead of the double helix we consider only parallel rods each having the form of the straight line@xcite . assuming that the twist and the bend motions are independent and only taking into account the first of the above motions , we have the mentioned torsional model .",

    "this fact can be explained because for greater distances the inhomogeneity has not influence on the discrete states of the eigenvalue problem for the stability analysis , namely its solution reduces to the translational mode which is stable .",
    "this change in the stability can only to be due to a releasing of energy , i.e , a rupture of the stronger bond . + the critical distance at which a rupture of the stronger bond occur , can be obtained from the eq.([a9 ] ) .",

    "in this section we briefly discuss some aspects concerning to the energetic contributions that appear in the presence of the inhomogeneities and it is a proposed field in order to model the motion of solitons as a point - particles as is usually done @xcite .",
    "the total energy for this mechanical model without to take into account the contribution due to inhomogeneities is given by the following expression :    @xmath69    where @xmath70 , @xmath71 are the energies due to elastic force between the cylinders of different chains and the torsional force between the cylinders of the same chain respectively .",

    "+ in order to build the potential function we have taken into account that for distances lower than the critical distance between the center of soliton and the inhomogeneity the elastic energy becomes zero because of the rupture of the bond at this distance . in a general form",
    "the potential function is :    @xmath78 ^ 2 \\hspace{1 cm }      \\xi - z_{0 } > d_{crit } \\\\ \\ 0\\hspace{10 cm } |\\xi - z_{0}| < d_{crit } \\nonumber \\\\",

    "+ in our model the stronger bonds distributed along the chain correspond to static inhomogeneities .",
    "the static inhomogeneities have been considered as perturbations in many nonlinear models@xcite . by using a perturbative procedure we can estimate the effect of inhomogeneities on solitons dynamics if the characteristic size of the impurities is either much larger or much smaller than the soliton size . for take into account only the zeroth - order approximation",
    "we suppose that the influence of the inhomogeneities on the soliton gives rise only to a change in their parameters , like the center position , velocity , ect .",
    "it is usually named adiabatic approach@xcite .",
    "+ for the eqs([todas7 ] ) , taking the antisymmetric solutions , the coupled equations become : @xmath82    this is the perturbed sine - gordon equation which for @xmath65 has a kink - like solution given by :    among the quantities that are conserved during the evolution there is the momentum    @xmath83    in the presence of inhomogeneities the momentum is no longer conserved by using eq(4.6 ) it is possible to show that it varies according to@xcite :    @xmath84    the adiabatic theory is defined by the assumption that for small enough values q , the kink shape will not be affected and its coordinate @xmath85 and its velocity @xmath19 will become slowly changing functions of time . within this hypothesis",
    "it can be shown that , in the non - relativistic limit @xmath86 , the kink center obeys the following evolution law .    @xmath87    where the potential function is    @xmath88    and @xmath89 , @xmath24 are the positions of the mass center and the inhomogeneity respectively .",
    "+ the eq.([27 ] ) is a dimensionless function , multiplying it by the term @xmath90 this becomes @xmath91    by comparing both eq.([22 ] ) and eq.([28 ] ) it is easy to(see fig.2)that there exist a great differences between the profiles of the two curves . +  such differences are explained , on the one hand , because the calculation of the standard potential was done with the zeroth - order approach , which only produces changes in parameters like center position , velocity , without altering the shape . on the other hand ,",
    "our proposal is a renormalized function which takes with a good approximation the deformation due to the interaction with the inhomogeneity .",
    "however the great difference owes its cause to the fact that the inhomogeneities on the contrary of other models , are localized in the bonds between the chains , therefore when the solitons ( rupture of bonds in a localized region along the coupled chains)are situated from the inhomogeneity below the critical distance it is removed because the bond is broken . from the energetic analysis and taking into a account this last issue we derive two implications , first , the maxima elastic potential energy is reached for this critical distance and second , a potential well is formed whose width is given by twice the critical distance , such as is depicted in the ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the existence of this potential well could given place to interesting dynamics for example localized traps for the solitons distributed along the couple chains .",
    "beside dna being a low dimensional system these results could give many possibilities in its applications for the develop of new nanoelectronic devices as reported for such systems@xcite .",
    "we have extended the model of yakushevich@xcite for the dna torsional dynamics , to take into account the presence of inhomogeneities in the molecular chains .",
    "the stability of certain kind of solitons that can propagate through the molecule , simulating the dynamics of open states , are studied .",
    "the obtained results are more general than those reported in the literature@xcite and include them as particular cases .",
    "we have found that for distances larger than 1.606 times the soliton s radius , the effect of the inhomogeneities in the structural stability of the open state can be neglected .",
    "furthermore we analyzed the motion of dna torsional solitons as the motion of point - particles through a renormalized potential function expressed in terms of the critical distance , which could give interesting dynamics .",
    "+ our study has been done considering the presence of only one inhomogeneity and for the antisymmetric solitons reported in@xcite as exact analytical solutions for the unperturbed model .",
    "subsequent studies can be directed to analyze the behavior of solitons between two inhomogeneities in terms of soliton s radius and the distance between inhomogeneities ratio .",
    "the more general case including a well - determined distribution of those bonds along the double helix will be considered in a future work .",
