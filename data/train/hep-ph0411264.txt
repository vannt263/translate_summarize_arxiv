    "within the next decade the mechanism responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) will hopefully be revealed by the lhc . for theoretical physicists this is a time at which many attempt to conjecture every possibility before experimental data ultimately chooses the correct one ( or at least narrows the list ) .",
    "the standard paradigm for weakly coupled ewsb is the higgs mechanism , however in the standard model ( sm ) there are quadratically divergent diagrams which contribute to the higgs mass .",
    "if new physics to cut off the quadratic divergences to the higgs mass does not occur at approximately the tev scale , the sm will be a finely tuned theory .",
    "as long as one takes naturalness as a guide for model building this implies that there should be new physics at the tev scale associated with the physics of ewsb . for two decades the standard for new physics at the tev scale , which cancels the quadratic divergences of the sm higgs , was supersymmetry . with the turn on of the lhc drawing near there",
    "have recently been many attempts at coming up with viable alternatives to supersymmetry .",
    "the alternative that will be focused on in this paper will be the little higgs mechanism  @xcite .    the origin of the little higgs idea dates back almost as far as supersymmetry to the papers of georgi et al .",
    "@xcite that attempted to realize the higgs as a pseudo - goldstone boson ( pgb ) .",
    "these original papers were unsuccessful due to the fact that they reintroduced a fine tuning to keep the symmetry breaking scale that generates the goldstone separate from the electroweak scale .",
    "the new mechanism that makes the higgs  little \" in the current reincarnation of the pgb idea is collective symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "collective symmetry breaking protects the higgs by several symmetries under each of which the higgs is an exact goldstone .",
    "only if the symmetries are broken collectively , i.e. by more than one coupling in the theory , can the higgs pick up a contribution to its mass and hence all one loop quadratic divergences ( which involve one coupling alone ) to the higgs mass are avoided .",
    "the generic structure of little higgs models  @xcite is a global symmetry broken at a scale @xmath0 which is around a tev . at the scale @xmath0",
    "there are new gauge bosons , scalars , and fermions responsible for cancelling the one loop quadratic divergences to the higgs mass from sm particles ( for a brief review of the gauge and global symmetries of most little higgs models see  @xcite ) .",
    "even though there are no direct experimental signatures that guide model building beyond the sm , there are many indirect constraints that a model of new physics must satisfy .",
    "whenever one tries to introduce new particles around the tev scale which couple to sm particles there is usually a tension with precision ew measurements which typically favor the scale of new physics to be @xmath1-@xmath2 tev .",
    "this tension between having to introduce new physics at the tev scale for naturalness , and ew precision tests ( ewpt ) preferring the scale of new physics to be a factor of @xmath3 higher is the so called  little \" hierarchy problem .",
    "the original little higgs models unfortunately did not relieve the tension caused by ewpt .",
    "the scale @xmath0 had to be raised significantly above a tev , which reintroduced a fine tuning to the higgs mass  @xcite .",
    "new little higgs models  @xcite were introduced with much larger symmetry structures that could incorporate a custodial @xmath4 symmetry which then ameliorated most of the problems from ew constraints . in keeping with the idea of looking for alternatives to susy a more economical solution to the  little \"",
    "hierarchy problem was proposed in  @xcite .    in trying to find alternatives to the mssm",
    "one should examine the model critically to find what are the keys to its success .",
    "the mssm is unarguably the most theoretically well motivated extension of the sm , including a stable hierarchy between the weak and planck scales , as well as gauge coupling unification .",
    "however the key to the mssm is @xmath5-parity , a discrete symmetry introduced by hand , without which the mssm would be ruled out by experiment .",
    "the motivation for @xmath5-parity is normally to forbid operators that would lead to rapid proton decay , but with the introduction of @xmath5-parity it also forbids dangerous four - fermion operators and contributions to z - pole observables .",
    "the @xmath5-parity also governs the signatures of the mssm in colliders since the conservation of @xmath5-parity requires all @xmath5-odd particles to be pair produced .",
    "if the lightest parity odd particle in the mssm is neutral , the signal in detectors will be missing energy .",
    "if the leading candidate for new physics at the tev scale relies upon a discrete symmetry to be phenomenologically acceptable it is quite plausible that its alternatives could incorporate a discrete symmetry as well  @xcite . introducing a discrete symmetry called  t - parity \" into little higgs models was done first in  @xcite , and applied to other little higgs models in  @xcite .",
    "t - parity is a natural symmetry of most little higgs models where sm particles are even under the symmetry while most of the new particles at the tev scale are odd .",
    "most of the constraints from ewpt on little higgs models  @xcite come from tree level mixing of heavy and light mass eigenstates which t - parity forbids .",
    "t - parity therefore solves the little hierarchy problem for the models in which it can be implemented  @xcite .",
    "t - parity also has a further benefit , if the lightest parity odd particle is neutral and t - parity is conserved it will be a candidate for a dark matter wimp ( just as r - parity provides a candidate wimp under the same circumstances for supersymmetry ) .",
    "in this paper we will study the phenomenology of the littlest higgs model  @xcite with the addition of t - parity  @xcite .",
    "there have been many studies of the phenomenology of the littlest higgs model  @xcite ; however with the introduction of t - parity most of these studies do not apply since the t - odd particles can not be singly produced .",
    "we begin with reviewing the littlest higgs model with t - parity in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "it turns out that there are several different approaches to incorporating t - parity into the littlest higgs model and we discuss in section  [ alternatives ] how most reduce to a similar low energy effective spectrum that we study . in section  [ darkmatter ]",
    "we investigate the phenomenology of the dark matter candidate in the littlest higgs model which is a heavy neutral gauge boson . in section  [ collider ]",
    "we explore the discovery possibilities for the littlest higgs with t - parity at the lhc . in appendix",
    "[ app : fourfermi ] , we discuss four fermion operators in the model that we chose to study . in appendix",
    "[ app : feyn ] we list feynman rules for the littlest higgs with t - parity to facilitate further study of the model .",
    "there are currently three known ways to implement t - parity in the littlest higgs model  @xcite .",
    "the first approach uses the technology of callan , coleman , wess , and zumino ( ccwz )  @xcite , where the model is almost identical to the original littlest higgs model except for the fermion sector .",
    "the other approaches  @xcite to implementing t - parity in the littlest higgs rely on enlarging the global and gauge symmetry structure but are similar to the ccwz littlest higgs model with t - parity in the low energy limit . for the sake of studying a concrete model",
    "we will first discuss in detail the ccwz approach that the calculations in this paper are based upon .",
    "we will then discuss the other ways to implement t - parity and how the low energy phenomenology of all three implementations are approximately the same .",
    "the original littlest higgs model was based on a non - linear @xmath6 model describing an @xmath7 symmetry breaking  @xcite and serves as the starting point for including t - parity  @xcite .",
    "the symmetry breaking can be thought of as originating from a vacuum expectation value(vev ) of a symmetric tensor of the @xmath8 global symmetry .",
    "a convenient basis for this breaking is characterized by the direction @xmath9 for the vev of the form @xmath10 the lie algebra made up of the broken generators , @xmath11 , and unbroken generators , @xmath12 , has an automorphism where @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which can be expressed as @xmath15 for any generator @xmath16 .",
    "this @xmath17 automorphism of the symmetric space @xmath7 will be a useful guide in implementing t - parity .",
    "the goldstone fluctuations are described by the pion fields @xmath18 .",
    "the non - linear sigma model field is then @xmath19 where @xmath0 is the value of the vev that accomplishes the breaking .",
    "an @xmath20 ^ 2 $ ] subgroup of the su(5 ) global symmetry is gauged , where the generators of the gauged symmetries are given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the pauli @xmath6 matrices .",
    "the @xmath23 s are @xmath24 matrices written in terms of @xmath25 , 1 , and @xmath26 blocks .",
    "the vacuum breaks the @xmath20 ^ 2 $ ] gauge symmetry down to the diagonal subgroup , giving one set of @xmath27 $ ] gauge bosons masses of order @xmath0 , while the other set are left massless , and are identified as the @xmath28 gauge fields of the standard model .",
    "the goldstone boson matrix @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the little higgs doublet @xmath32 and @xmath33 is a complex triplet under @xmath34 which forms a symmetric tensor @xmath35 with components @xmath36 and a pseudoscalar @xmath37 as defined in  @xcite .",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath37 are both real scalars .",
    "the goldstone bosons which are eaten to become the longitudinal modes of the partners of the standard model gauge fields are set to zero in the pion matrix , as we have gone to unitary gauge .    the underlying idea for implementing t - parity",
    "is to assign all non - sm particles odd parity , and all sm particles even parity , thus avoiding tree level constraints from ewpt .",
    "it turns out that there will be one case in which this assignment is not possible when we discuss the top quark sector of the model , however for the gauge and scalar sectors all non - sm particles are t - odd . to implement t - parity in the gauge sector one",
    "notices that the @xmath9 vev separates the gauged generators into a broken set @xmath39 and an unbroken set @xmath40 of generators . using the action of the @xmath41 inner automorphism discussed earlier , @xmath42 for unbroken generators , and @xmath43 for broken generators , a natural action of t - parity on the gauge fields",

    "the kinetic terms for the sigma field and gauge bosons are invariant under t - parity as written down originally in the littlest higgs model with the additional proviso that @xmath54 and @xmath55 . since t - parity exchanges the gauge fields ( [ tpargauge ] )",
    ", the gauge couplings must be equal for the lagrangian to be invariant .",
    "we identify @xmath56 and @xmath57 with the sm @xmath4 and @xmath58 gauge couplings respectively .    in the gauge sector before ewsb there is a linear combination of gauge bosons that acquire a mass of order @xmath0 from ( [ eq : sigkin ] ) , @xmath59 while the linear combinations @xmath60 remain massless and",
    "are identified with the sm gauge bosons . from the t - parity transformation ( [ tpargauge ] )",
    "the heavy gauge bosons are odd under t - parity while the sm gauge bosons are even .",
    "after ewsb the vev of the higgs , @xmath61 , will shift the mass eigenstates in the heavy gauge boson sector .",
    "the new mass eigenstates in the neutral heavy sector will be a linear combination of the @xmath62 and the @xmath63 gauge bosons , producing an @xmath64 and a @xmath65 .",
    "the mixing angle introduced into the neutral heavy sector by ewsb will be of order @xmath66 : @xmath67 the new heavy neutral mass eigenstates are given by @xmath68 while a set of heavy charged gauge bosons can be written as @xmath69    in the scalar sector from the t - parity transformation ( [ tparscalar ] ) one can see that the higgs doublet has positive parity under this transformation , and that the @xmath34 triplet @xmath33 has odd parity . we will briefly recall that in a little higgs model , ewsb is generated radiatively through the coleman - weinberg potential .",
    "the difference from  @xcite in this sector with the addition of t - parity is that the coupling @xmath70 is forbidden by t - parity .",
    "the absence of the @xmath70 coupling forbids a dangerous non - zero triplet vev@xcite after ewsb .",
    "the mass of @xmath33 can be related to the mass of the higgs from the coleman - weinberg potential  @xcite to give @xmath71 where all components of the triplet are degenerate at the order we are examining .",
    "it summary , the implementation of t - parity for the gauge sector has essentially decoupled the light and heavy sectors by setting @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "t - parity has also forbidden the vev of the triplet @xmath33 .",
    "most constraints from ewpt on the original littlest higgs  @xcite vanish in this limit .    to fully implement t - parity in a consistent way we must now turn our attention to the fermion sector .",
    "we would like to introduce sm fermions that transform linearly under the gauge symmetries to avoid large contributions to four fermion operators that would require the scale @xmath0 to be large  @xcite . since t - parity exchanges @xmath74 and @xmath75 one must introduce two doublets @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , which transform linearly under @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively .",
    "these doublets are mapped into each other under the action of t - parity . to obtain the sm at low energy we would like to give an @xmath0 scale mass to the t - odd linear combination of these doublets . in giving mass to only the t - odd linear combination , at this stage",
    "one should introduce a  mirror \" fermion with odd parity and write down a mass term with the t - odd linear combination of @xmath76 and @xmath77  @xcite . since t - parity exchanges the two @xmath4 s , to avoid introducing an additional copy of the mirror fermion , it must have a non - linear symmetry transformation .",
    "we will now explain in detail how to make a gauge invariant term that only gives mass to the t - odd linear combination of @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "for those readers only interested in the phenomenology it is not crucial to understand where in the end the expression ( [ heavyyuk ] ) comes from , but it is important to note that there will be additional interactions apart from just mass terms in ( [ heavyyuk ] ) .",
    "a set of mirror fermions @xmath78 is introduced in a complete multiplet of @xmath79 , whose transformation under @xmath8 is non - linear .",
    "the mirror fermions must be introduced in a complete multiplet in order to eliminate potential quartic divergences in the higgs mass  @xcite . in order to give this @xmath78 multiplet interactions with other fields which obey linear transformation laws ,",
    "we introduce a field @xmath80 .",
    "this technology , for those readers familiar with it , is reminiscent of introducing baryons in a nonlinear chiral @xmath81 model  @xcite . in terms of @xmath82 ,",
    "the field @xmath49 can be expressed as @xmath83 . from the linear transformation of @xmath49",
    ", we infer that the field @xmath82 has the following transformation under a global @xmath8 rotation @xmath84 : @xmath85 where @xmath86 takes values in the lie algebra of the unbroken @xmath79 subgroup , and is a function of both @xmath84 and the pion fields .",
    "it is this same @xmath86 under which the @xmath78 multiplet transforms : @xmath87 the fermion doublets @xmath88 can be embedded into incomplete representations @xmath89 of @xmath8 , and the field content can be expressed as follows : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a singlet and @xmath92 is a doublet under @xmath75 .",
    "the transformation laws for @xmath93 and @xmath94 are as follows : @xmath95 the action of t - parity on the multiplets takes @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "one can now write down a yukawa - type interaction to give masses to the mirror fermions , @xmath98 which is invariant under a global @xmath8 rotation , and also under the action of t - parity . from ( [ heavyyuk ] )",
    "one fermion doublet @xmath99 acquires a mass @xmath100 , while the other combination @xmath101 remains massless and is identified with the sm doublets . to give masses to the remaining fields @xmath91 and",

    "after introducing the yukawa coupling ( [ heavyyuk ] ) which gives the mirror fermions mass we need to introduce kinetic terms for the fermions in this model .",
    "since @xmath93 and @xmath94 transform linearly , their kinetic terms are straightforward to write down : @xmath106 where @xmath107 and the @xmath108 charges @xmath109 are given in table [ tb : charges ] which will can be determined from gauge invariance of the yukawa couplings and t - parity .",
    "re - expressing ( [ lkinsm ] ) in terms of the mass eigenstates found from ( [ heavyyuk ] ) one obtains @xmath110 which contains the usual kinetic terms for the sm doublet fermions where @xmath111 is the usual sm covariant derivative , as well as kinetic terms for the heavy fermions .",
    "in addition to the standard kinetic terms in  ( [ lkinsmmass ] ) there are interaction terms of the form @xmath112 where @xmath113 is a gauge coupling and @xmath114 is a heavy gauge boson .",
    "these new interactions between heavy and light fields come from expressing  ( [ lkinsm ] ) in mass eigenstates .",
    "to write down an invariant kinetic term for the @xmath78 field we must make use of the @xmath82 field in the following way @xmath115 where @xmath116 @xmath117 is the t - parity transformed covariant derivative .",

    "there are dangerous four fermion operators arising at the one loop level which the t - odd partners of the standard model left handed doublets serve to cut off , thus these fermions can not be taken to be arbitrarily heavy .",
    "we discuss this in more detail in appendix a. for the purposes of studying a simpler , and model independent phenomenology , we neglect these fermions in this paper , leaving their study for future work .    in order to avoid dangerous contributions to the higgs mass from one loop quadratic divergences ,",
    "the third generation yukawa sector must be modified so that it incorporates the collective symmetry breaking pattern of @xcite . in order to do this , the @xmath93 and @xmath94 multiplets for the third generation must be completed to representations of the @xmath118 and @xmath119 subgroups of the full @xmath8 .",
    "these are @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 obey the same transformation laws under t - parity and the @xmath8 symmetry as do @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "it should be noted that the quark doublets are embedded such that @xmath123 one must also introduce additional singlets @xmath124 and @xmath125 which transform under t - parity as @xmath126 so the top sector masses can be generated in the following t - parity invariant way @xmath127 u_{3r } { \\nonumber \\\\ } & & \\hspace{1 in } + \\lambda_2 f ( \\bar{t}'_1 t'_{1r } + \\bar{t}'_2 t'_{2r})+ h.c.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we point out that this is a slightly different implementation of the top yukawa coupling than in  @xcite ; t - parity and gauge invariance require the couplings of @xmath128 and @xmath129 to be equal and leads to new phenomenology for the heavy top quarks .",
    "this yukawa term generates a mass for the top quark given by @xmath130 while the t - even combination of @xmath128 and @xmath129 has mass @xmath131 and the t - odd combination has mass @xmath132 with @xmath133 .",

    "we have found bounds on the scale @xmath0 from the analysis of the dark matter candidate ( under the assumption that t - parity is conserved ) , however , a full analysis of ew precision constraints including loop contributions needs to be done to find complementary constraints .",
    "the discovery channels that we have discussed need to be further investigated beyond our simple treatment of the background to see if this model can really be distinguished or not from the ubiquitous background of the lhc .",
    "one might also investigate the t - odd fermion spectrum , which is quite interesting from the standpoint of phenomenology .",
    "we analyzed only the gauge , scalar , and top sectors , however in principle all the new fermions could be within reach of the lhc making the parameter space much larger and give other opportunities for discovery .",
    "a study of how to distinguish the littlest higgs with t - parity from the mssm ( or other models designed to fake susy ) at the lhc is also of paramount interest .",
    "the @xmath203 would be an obvious distinguishing characteristic of t - parity however it could be out of the discovery reach of the lhc .",
    "although the existence of t - parity greatly complicates deciphering the data of the lhc , it provides an interesting solution to the little hierarchy problem that deserves further study .",
    "we would like to thank maxim perelstein for useful discussions as well as reading the manuscript and making helpful comments .",
    "we would like to thank ian low for clarification of some aspects of the t - parity models .",
    "we would also like to thank csaba cski and konstantin matchev for reading the manuscript and making helpful comments .",
    "p.m would like to thank the university of colorado at boulder tasi program , and p.m would like to thank the t-8 group at los alamos national lab for hospitality and support while this work was in progress .",
    "the research of j.h . and",
    "p.m. is supported in part by the nsf under grant phy-0355005 .",
    "the four fermion operators that ruled out the models of @xcite are absent in this model , since the standard model fermions transform linearly .",
    "however , there are still finite diagrams which are potentially dangerous , and must be checked . in the model that we discuss ,",
    "the types of diagrams are shown in figure [ 4fdiag ] . by nda , these diagrams give effective four - fermion contact terms which are approximately given by : @xmath262 respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath263 refers to the ratio of the pion mass to the breaking scale , @xmath0 .",
    "we have taken @xmath263 to be larger than @xmath56 . in order to avoid bounds on such contact terms",
    ", these must be less than @xmath264 .    , @xmath65 , or @xmath265 .",
    "the fermion lines in the loops represent exchange of the heavy t - odd fermions . ]",
    "one might expect that these can be easily suppressed by taking @xmath266 to be large , however a more careful analysis is required .",
    "the interactions involving the coupling @xmath267 originate from the heavy fermion yukawas @xmath268 where the fermion multiplets are given by @xmath269 it is from this term that the diagrams with goldstone boson exchange in the loop emerge . however , this term is also generating a mass term @xmath270 for the dirac pair @xmath271 .",
    "this could potentially give a fixed relation between @xmath267 and @xmath266 that would force the parameter @xmath267 to be relatively small , prohibiting a decoupling limit .",
    "for example , if the mass of the heavy fermion is @xmath270 , then the contact operator would be @xmath272 in this case , we would require @xmath273 for @xmath230 tev .",
    "most of the interactions in ( [ heavyyuk2 ] ) , however , do not lead to amplitudes where we have such a relation , and many of the fermion masses can be made quite heavy .",
    "in particular , it is only the right handed doublet , @xmath274 which must be kept close to the breaking scale @xmath0 .",
    "the four - fermion operator that involves @xmath274 exchanges the goldstones which are eaten by the heavy vector fields @xmath143 and @xmath65 , and these operators can not be suppressed since it is @xmath274 which gets its mass from the yukawa interaction in eq .",
    "all of the vertices appearing in figure [ 4fdiag ] that involve the triplet , @xmath33 couple the standard model fermion to the doublet @xmath92 , rather than @xmath274 .",
    "the parameters @xmath266 that appear in the four fermion diagrams above are then independent of @xmath267 .",
    "simply taking @xmath275 suppresses the dangerous amplitudes .",
    "we note , though , that we do not take @xmath266 to the strong coupling limit .",
    "first , this would be dangerous for potential quartic divergences in the higgs mass @xcite .",
    "second , we are attempting to avoid taking any parameters in the theory into a non - perturbative regime .",
    "we have shown here that we can in fact raise the masses of the many of the additional fermions above the minimal little higgs spectrum .",
    "in example , for an @xmath0 of @xmath145 tev , the masses of most t - odd fermions are all at @xmath276 tev , safe enough to neglect in collider and dark matter phenomenology , yet light enough to avoid theoretical issues involving large contributions to the higgs mass through two loop quartically divergent diagrams .",
    "the couplings required to raise the masses sufficiently are still within the perturbative regime , so we have not resorted to a strong coupling limit . with the resulting tev scale spectrum , we compute the phenomenology of a littlest higgs with t - parity which is similar to the low energy limit of the other models which incorporate this discrete symmetry .",
    "we leave an analysis of the lighter t - odd partners of the standard model doublets for future research .",
    "in this appendix we will provide a list of feynman rules specific to the t - parity littlest higgs as a reference to facilitate further study of the model .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec : model ] implementing t - parity in the littlest higgs for the gauge and scalar sectors does not require a drastic change to the structure of the original littlest higgs .",
    "the effect in the gauge sector is to set the gauge couplings , @xmath277 , in the original littlest higgs to be @xmath54 , and likewise for the @xmath57 couplings . in the scalar sector",
    "the effect is essentially to forbid a vev for the triplet @xmath33 by forbidding the t - odd coupling @xmath278 . with this in mind a great many of the feynman rules",
    "can be obtained from  @xcite which listed all the feynman rules for the littlest higgs .",
    "we will give a guide to how to obtain the t - parity feynman rules from the feynman rules in  @xcite .",
    "we then will list the additional feynman rules specific to the t - parity littlest higgs .",
    "if one uses tables i - viii in  @xcite for the feynman rules in the scalar and gauge sectors , it is necessary to apply the following rules for the parameters in  @xcite to obtain the correct vertices for the t - parity littlest higgs model : @xmath279 however when using ( [ taorules ] ) with the tables referred to in  @xcite certain t - even interactions will naively be set to @xmath280 since t - parity will cause certain interactions to start at a higher order in a @xmath212 expansion than taken into account .",
    "these interactions that can not be found in  @xcite need to be included for studying certain phenomenological processes . as an example certain components of the @xmath33",
    "would be unnaturally long lived since most decay channels are missing if one does not include the higher order interactions . in table",
    "[ tparityzero ] we list the feynman rules for t - parity even interactions that are zero in the order considered by  @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath281 and @xmath282 refer to the sine and cosine of the weak mixing angle @xmath283 , while @xmath284    the fermion sector of the littlest higgs with t - parity is radically different than the original littlest higgs model , therefore the feynman rules of  @xcite do not apply .",
    "the sm fermions of the first two generation of quarks and all three generations of leptons have their usual sm couplings .",
    "however , in the third generation the new yukawa interactions required to cancel the quadratic divergences of the top quark will shift some sm couplings at @xmath285 .",
    "the @xmath203 and @xmath202 couplings are also new in the t - parity littlest higgs so we will include all these feynman rules in table  [ newfeyntab ] and table  [ newfeyngauge ] .",
    "the phenomenology of the littlest higgs with t - parity could be markedly changed by the inclusion of the additional fermions around the tev scale .",
    "there exist interactions of heavy fermions with sm particles that come from re - expressing the kinetic terms in mass eigenstates , and are generally of the form @xmath286 as shown in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "these interactions potentially can be flavor changing depending on the implementation of the heavy mirror fermion yukawa term  ( [ heavyyuk ] ) .",
    "there are also interactions similar to  ( [ vecint ] ) which involve heavy scalars instead of heavy vector bosons which come from  ( [ heavyyuk ] ) .",
    "finally there are interactions of heavy fermions with sm gauge bosons coming from ( [ lkinsmmass ] ) and ( [ kinmirror ] ) .",
    "we do not include the feynman rules for these interactions , since they were not necessary for the sectors studied in this paper , and they are dependent upon the implementation ( in terms of flavor ) of the mirror fermion mass terms .",
    "for the reader interested in investigating the fermion sector of the model in more detail , one must choose an implementation of flavor for the heavy mirror fermion yukawa s  ( [ heavyyuk ] ) and work out the interactions .        h.  georgi and a.  pais , phys .",
