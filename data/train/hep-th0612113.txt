    "many authors argue that superluminal fields are not causal@xcite ( but see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "this is not true , unless one refers to an indefensible notion of causality . indeed , as the notion of causality evolves from newtonian dynamics to special relativity ( sr ) , one must as well reconsider the notion of causality from special or general relativity ( gr ) , in which spacetime is only endowed with the flat ( resp .",
    "gravitational ) metric , to the case where it is endowed with a finite set of lorentzian metrics ( notably then , if there are superluminal fields ) .    in this short communication based on the more detailed paper@xcite",
    ", we thus look for an expression of causality in such a multi - metric framework . the gravitational metric field",
    "is denoted by @xmath0 , and @xmath1 is a four - dimensional differentiable manifold .",
    "the analysis of the notion of causality leads in particular to the following : * observation 1 * : since causes must precede effects , causally connected events must be time - ordered .",
    "causality thus needs a notion of chronology to be expressed .",
    "* observation 2 * : any lorentzian metric over @xmath1 defines a local chronology ( in the tangent space ) , through the special relativistic notions of absolute future and past .    gluing these two points together , we get the following * main point * : in relativistic field theories , there are _ as many _ notions of causality as there are non - conformally related metrics over @xmath1 .",
    "these metrics @xmath2 are the one along which the various fields @xmath3 propagate , with velocities @xmath4 .",
    "this plurality of the notion of causality is the crucial feature of multi - metric theories .",
    "_ indeed , it does not make any sense to assert that a given theory is -or not- causal , if one does not define to which metric ( i.e. to which chronology ) he refers to_. a theory which appear to be non causal w.r.t some metric may be causal w.r.t another metric .    to face this issue ,",
    "one may be tempted to assume that there exists a preferred metric field over @xmath1 .",
    "in other words , one may fix a preferred chronology and its associated causal structure .",
    "most of the literature on causality and superluminal fields is based -often implicitly- on this first approach . in their famous textbook @xcite , hawking and ellis recognize explicitly that their notion of causality is defined w.r.t the gravitational metric .",
    "this constitutes a `` _ _ postulate _ _ which sets the metric * g * apart from the other fields on @xmath1 and gives it its distinctive geometrical character''@xcite ( p.60 ) . as a consequence , fields that propagate faster than gravitons are not causal .",
    "thus , `` the null cones of the matter equations [ must ] coincide or lie within the null cone of the spacetime metric @xmath0''@xcite ( p.255 ) .",
    "although such an attitude does not pose any problem when spacetime is endowed with only one metric , as is the case of gr plus matter fields that couple to @xmath0 , it becomes highly problematic in the multi - metric case .",
    "first , indeed , there is no way to find which metric should be favored , and which should not .",
    "thus , by invoking causality , different authors may find opposite requirements on the theory@xcite .",
    "second , let us consider two fields @xmath3 propagating along the metrics @xmath2 ( @xmath5 ) , such that @xmath6 travels faster than @xmath7 . following the above reasonning , we can define causality w.r.t the metric @xmath8 . then",
    "two observers that are spacelike related w.r.t @xmath8 ( and hence , non time - ordered ) but timelike related w.r.t @xmath9 must be considered as causally disconnected , whereas they can interact thanks to the field @xmath6 .",
    "the only way to avoid so an absurd conclusion is to define causality w.r.t to the metric that defines the wider cone in the tangent space ( see below ) .",
    "third , any choice of a preferred metric is equivalent to a choice of preferred coordinates which , locally , diagonalize it .",
    "but the existence of preferred coordinates , or equivalently , of preferred rods and clocks@xcite , is in great conflict with the whole spirit of gr , namely diffeomorphism invariance ; coordinates are meaningless in gr .",
    "the above attitude is thus irrelevant in the multi - metric case . as an application",
    ", one should not invoke such a notion of causality to put constraints on the theory ( notably in order to fix various signs ) , contrary to what is done in the literature@xcite .",
    "there is only one relevant notion of ( extended ) chronology that does not refer to a given metric .",
    "this consists@xcite in defining the extended future of a point @xmath10 as the union of the futures of @xmath10 defined by each metric @xmath2 .",
    "the corresponding ( extended ) notion of causality is thus in accordance with the notion of interaction .",
    "it would however allow non - causally connected observers to interact , as in the previous section . ] .",
    "it is very permissive in the sense that , by construction , any field theory is _ a priori _ causal provided that the various fields propagate along lorentzian metrics , so that the ( extended ) spacelike region is never empty .",
    "moreover , interactions can not threaten this causal behavior , since , by construction , the extended future and past are defined at _ each _ point of @xmath1 . which metric defines the wider cone may thus depend on the location on spacetime .",
    "in particular , superluminal fields are _ a priori _ causal .",
    "of course , this construction is not sufficient .",
    "causality also requires , first , that the whole theory has an initial value formulation .",
    "this is generically the case if the field equations form a quasilinear , diagonal and second order hyperbolic system@xcite .",
    "beware however that initial data must be assigned on hypersurfaces that are spacelike in the extended sense , that is spacelike w.r.t to _ all _ metrics @xmath2 .",
    "all the difficulties in the cauchy problem of superluminal fields found in the literature arise from an irrelevant choice of initial data surfaces@xcite .",
    "second , a _ local _",
    "chronology is not enough .",
    "we must have at hand a global chronology over spacetime , in order to prevent , e.g. the existence of closed timelike curves . in the multi - metric case",
    ", we shall also require that our extended chronology is a global one , that is that no closed extended - timelike curves exist .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that a particular superluminal scalar field may suffer from such a global pathology .",
    "this is however not enough to kill this theory , for the very reason that gr itself may suffer from such causal anomalies .",
    "therefore , difficulties at a global level _ do not _ signal an intrinsic disease of superluminal fields .",
    "rather , they originate from the fact that the global topology of the universe is not imposed by local field equations .",
    "it is therefore necessary to _ assume _ that spacetime does not involve any closed ( extended ) timelike curves to ensure causality .",
