    "emerging technological capabilities to control femtosecond pulse durations and down - to - one - hertz bandwidth resolutions provide novel probes on vibrational dynamics and excitation relaxation which were elusive in the past @xcite .",
    "recently , developments in ultrafast laser physics and technologies allow us to study the nonequilibrium carrier / exciton dynamics that was previously inaccessible to traditional linear optical spectroscopy .",
    "in contrast , modeling of polaron dynamics has not received much deserved attention .",

    "two kinds of exciton - phonon interactions can be included in the holstein model , namely , the diagonal coupling ( marked by an arrow attached to a single site ) as a nontrivial dependence of the exciton site energies on the lattice coordinates , and the off - diagonal coupling ( marked by an arrow attached to two nearest - neighboring sites ) as a nontrivial dependence of the exciton transfer integral on the lattice coordinates @xcite . simultaneous presence of diagonal and off - diagonal coupling seems crucial to characterize solid - state excimers , where a variety of experimental and theoretical considerations imply a strong dependence of electronic tunneling upon certain coordinated distortions of neighboring molecules in the formation of bound excited states @xcite .",
    "however , in the literature , little attention has been paid to the hamiltonians containing the off - diagonal exciton - phonon coupling due to inherent difficulties to obtain reliable solutions @xcite , especially for the polaron dynamics @xcite .",
    "early treatments of off - diagonal coupling include the munn - silbey theory @xcite which is based upon a perturbative approach with added constraints on canonical transformation coefficients determined by a self - consistency equation . the global - local ( gl)_ansatz _ @xcite , formulated by zhao _",

    "various numerical approaches were developed in the past few decades , including the exact diagonalization ( ed ) @xcite , quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulation @xcite , variational method @xcite , density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite , the variational exact diagonalization ( ved ) @xcite , and the method of relevant coherent states @xcite .",
    "most of these approaches were designed to probe the ground - state properties .",
    "for excited - state properties and dynamics of the polaronic systems , however , few of them provide a satisfactory resolution .",
    "for example , a time - dependent variant of dmrg , i.e. , t - dmrg @xcite , was developed to elucidate the polaron dynamics .",
    "yet , it can not accurately simulate the system dynamics from an arbitrary initial state , since high - lying excited states can not be adequately described by dmrg .",
    "fortunately , the variational approach is still effective in dealing with polaron dynamics so long as a proper trial wave function is chosen .",

    "time - dependent variational parameters which specify the trial state are obtained from solving a set of coupled differential equations generated by the lagrangian formalism of the dirac frenkel variation .",
    "validity of this approach is carefully checked by quantifying how faithfully the trial state follows the schrdinger equation @xcite .",
