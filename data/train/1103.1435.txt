    "hot subdwarf b ( sdb ) stars are horizontal branch stars with masses about 0.5 m@xmath1 and very thin , in mass , hydrogen envelopes .",
    "their average effective temperature and surface gravity are about 30000  k and @xmath25.5 , respectively .",
    "although the future evolution of the sdb stars to the white dwarf cooling track is generally accepted , their formation prior to the sdb stage is under debate resulting in several mechanisms that involve single - star or binary evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the detection of pulsations in sdb stars opened a way to study their interiors and may help to understand their evolution prior to the horizontal branch .",
    "first , short period oscillations were found by @xcite in ec14026 - 2647 ( now officially named v391hya ) . according to theoretical models ,",
    "these pulsations are attributed to pressure modes and are driven in the outer part of the star @xcite .",
    "several years later , @xcite announced another kind of variability in sdb stars . in this case , however , the pulsations were identified with gravity modes .",
    "following @xcite they are driven deeper in the sdb stars than the pressure ones .",
    "short - period sdbv ( sdb variable ) stars are located at higher , while long - period sdbv stars at lower effective temperatures .",
    "the pulsation modes of the two kinds of sdbvs probe different regions , and stars displaying both types are particularly interesting since their interiors can be better constrained .",
    "such hybrid pulsations were first found in dw lyn @xcite and another three objects with clear pulsations at both short and long periods have so far been recognized ; balloon090100001 @xcite , v391peg @xcite and rat0455 + 1305 @xcite .",
    "another star , cs1246 , has similar @xmath3 and @xmath4 and one high amplitude short periodicity detected .",
    "unfortunately , because of noisy data , the detection threshold in the low frequency region is too high .",
    "the best data are in the r filter , and the amplitude spectrum calculated from these data contains some excess signal in the low frequency region , but more data are needed to confirm if cs1246 is a hybrid pulsator",
    ". this should encourage others to obtain more observations of cs1246 .",
    "extremely high precision photometry obtained with the kepler spacecraft has revealed several long period sdbvs @xcite and one short period sdbv @xcite that appear to also show hybrid modes , at least intermittently , that are so weak that they can only be detected using satellite data .",
    "an unusual hybrid pulsator in an eclipsing binary , 2m1938 + 4603 , was found to show an exceptionally large number of weak ( @xmath50.5mma ) pulsation modes spanning all frequencies from the long period to the short period regime @xcite .",
    "typical amplitudes of sdbv stars showing high frequency oscillations are below 1% , which corresponds to 10mma .",
    "most hybrid stars have unusually high amplitudes ( few per cent ) , making them extremely desirable .",
    "since sdbv stars tend to be faint ( @xmath6mag ) high amplitude pulsators are easier to observe , even with 1 m class telescopes .",
    "as was shown by @xcite , for hybrid stars the dominant modes in both frequency domains appear at very similar frequencies . these are @xmath7 0.3mhz for gravity modes and",
    "@xmath7 2.8mhz for pressure modes . as for gravity modes",
    ", it may not be so surprising as the peaks are detected in a very small range , but for the pressure modes it is more astonishing .",
    "this may indicate that these stars are alike in internal structure and/or evolutionary status on the horizontal branch . in this paper",
    "we present our discovery of a new hybrid sdbv star with a high amplitude short period mode .",
    "we obtained data on four nights , including the discovery one .",

    "* ais ) observation obtained on february 2 , 2006 . after comparing the uv magnitudes with visual photometry in the nomad survey ( @xmath8=13.88 , @xmath9=14.23 , @xmath10=14.83 ) , we flagged the target as a likely sdb star , and it entered a list of bright spectroscopy targets that served as a poor weather backup for a photometric observation run in the not search for pulsating sdbs in january 2009 @xcite .",
    "the extracted spectrum was fitted to a model atmosphere spectrum , using the same procedure as for the other sdbs observed during the search program .",
    "the derived effective temperature of 28,877(@xmath0202)k and surface gravity of 5.34(@xmath00.03)dex along with its encouraging brightness made it a priority target for the next observing season .",
    "recently , @xcite have published their first results from a survey of uv - excess stars in the galex archive , and j08069 + 1527 is included in their sample .",

    "we performed time - series spectroscopy on the night starting on 7 jan 2010 .",
    "we used alfosc at the nordic optical telescope ( not ) to obtain 472 low resolution spectra .",
    "we used grism#16 and , for all but the first few exploratory spectra , we used a 1.3-arcsec wide vertical slit .",
    "our dataset spans a total of 6 hours and 40 minutes .",
    "we used a small window and 2@xmath122 binning in the spatial direction to minimize readout - overheads ; the window allowed for 28arcseconds of sky on either side of the stellar spectrum . to avoid under - sampling and to not smear the dominant variability too much , we set the exposure time to 30sec , achieving a 42-sec cycle time .",
    "in the course of our run we obtained spectra of a helium arc lamp to calibrate the wavelength .    unfortunately , since the brightness of this star is about 14mag in the b filter only , we could not achieve very high s / n ratio . for single spectra we had typical s / n@xmath715 in the 440 - 480 nm region , while we reached s / n@xmath7150 in the average spectrum shown in fig.[averspec ] .",
    "we used standard _",
    "iraf _ procedures to reduce and calibrate the spectra , leading to 472 extracted spectra .",
    "we normalized the average spectrum to unity , using a low - order polynomial fit .",
    "the resulting spectrum was then fitted with a model spectrum , and the resulting model spectrum was used for guidance in the final normalization of the average spectrum .",
    "the stellar parameters we derived from the average spectrum ( @xmath13 , @xmath4 and @xmath14 in fig.[spfit ] ) were consistent for different normalization / rectification methods that either employ straight - line fits around each balmer line or a multi - order polynomial fit that rectifies the complete spectrum at once . then all individually extracted spectra were rectified using the fit that was needed to normalize the average spectrum . finally the individual spectra were scaled to get their continuum at unity , using a simple parabolic fit in the regions with no absorption lines .",
    "we derived @xmath13=28,063@xmath0163k , @xmath4=5.39@xmath00.02 and @xmath15=-2.971@xmath00.064dex .",
    "these values are different than those derived from spectrum taken in january 2009 so we adopt an average value for all three parameters : @xmath13=28,500@xmath0400k , @xmath4=5.37@xmath00.05dex and @xmath15=-2.96@xmath00.10",
    ". the reader should be aware , though , that systematic effects from the model grid can give shifts on the order of 2000k and 0.2dex in @xmath13 and @xmath4 , respectively .    to look for radial velocity ( rv )",
    "displacements we used the _ iraf _ cross - correlation routine _ fxcor _ , finding the radial - velocity shift of each individual spectrum with respect to that of the average spectrum .",
    "we included only the wavelength regions around 7 balmer lines ( h_@xmath16_-h_10 _ ) in the cross - correlation .",
    "we fitted a gaussian function to find the center of the cross - correlation function , which we adopted as a measure of the radial - velocity shift . as a result we obtained heliocentric julian date along with rv shifts and their errors .",
    "we present the radial velocity curve in fig.[rv ] .",
    "this result was subject to fourier analysis in order to extract any periodicity from the data .",
    "the amplitude spectrum is shown in fig.[not - ft ] . by means of non linear",
    "least square fitting , we detected only one peak which satisfies s / n@xmath174 .",
    "its frequency , amplitude and phase with errors are : 2.8202(42)mhz , 6.1(1.0)km / s and 5.69(17)rad , respectively .",
    "the phase is given at hjd=2455204.577483 .",

    "in this paper we presented our discovery of a new hybrid pulsating subdwarf b star , j08069 + 1527 .",
    "effective temperature and surface gravity place this object in the instability strip among other hybrid subdwarfs . from our analysis of photometric data we detected four peaks , including two in the low frequency domain , confirming our prediction .",
    "as the star is relatively faint , spectroscopic data is not sufficient to detect more than just the dominant mode we found in the discovery data .",
    "however , it proved that time - series spectroscopy at 2 m class telescope can support our analysis with radial velocity shifts down to 14mag hot subdwarf stars , particularly when data are taken over several nights",
    ".        as it turns out , physical parameters are not the only similarities j08069 + 1527 has to other hybrid sdbv stars . as shown in (",
    "* in fig.9 ) , some hybrids share a common frequency for their dominant variation and j08069 + 1527 also has this characteristic",
    ". it might be that these stars are in very similar evolutionary state and/or have very similar stellar structure .",
    "if so , we could use the result obtained by @xcite to constrain the degree of the dominant mode to @xmath18=0 .",
    "balloon090100001 has photometrically constrained pulsation modes using multiplets @xcite .",
    "the dominant periodicity in balloon090100001 , associated with an @xmath19 mode , has a photometric amplitude in a b filter of 53mma and a radial velocity ( rv ) amplitude of 19.2km / s .",
    "the amplitude ratio of rv / b is 0.362 .",
    "the dominant periodicity in j08069 + 1527 has an amplitude of 27mma in a b(geneva ) filter and rv=6.1km / s which results in a ratio of 0.226 .",
    "the difference in ratio is substantial , however , the amplitude spectrum of j08069 + 1527 might be unresolved and the amplitude of the dominant mode affected by poor resolution .",
    "more data of j08069 + 1527 taken over several days may help to better compare results on these two interesting stars .",
