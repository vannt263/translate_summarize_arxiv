    "coalescing compact binaries consisting of black holes and/or neutron stars are among the most promising sources for ground - based interferometric gravitational wave ( gw ) detectors .",
    "one of the main challenges of the data analysis for this kind of sources is to create a template bank with which the detector output may be optimally filtered .",
    "this , in turn , requires an accurate description of the time - evolution of the gw phase .",
    "binary coalescences are the end state of a long period of adiabatic dynamics in which the orbital frequency of the system changes as a result of gravitational radiation reaction but the change in frequency per orbit is negligible compared to the orbital frequency itself",
    ". then the inspiral orbit can be thought of as an adiabatic perturbation of a number of circular orbits ( with a specific _ conserved _ energy associated with each of them ) .",
    "given the binding energy @xmath2 and gravitational wave luminosity @xmath3 of the binary , the phasing @xmath4 of the waves can be calculated in the _ adiabatic _ approximation using the following ordinary , coupled differential equations :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the total mass of the binary .",
    "the binding energy @xmath2 and gravitational wave luminosity @xmath3 are calculated , in general , as post - newtonian ( pn ) expansions in terms of an invariantly defined velocity parameter @xmath8 . = @xmath9 = 1 . ] the phasing of gws obtained by numerically solving the above phasing formula is called _ taylort1 _",
    "approximant @xcite .",
    "the standard approach to the gw phasing is based on the pn expansions of the binding energy ( energy function ) and gw luminosity ( flux function ) truncated at the _ same relative _ pn order @xcite . at the lowest order ,",
    "it uses only the leading terms in the energy ( newtonian ) and flux ( quadrupolar ) functions . for higher order phasing ,",
    "the energy and flux functions are retained to the same relative pn orders .",
    "we refer to this usual physical treatment of the phasing of gws computed in the adiabatic approximation as the _ standard adiabatic _ approximation .    with a view to go beyond the adiabatic approximation ,",
    "we must think of this in terms of the dynamics of the binary under conservative relativistic forces and gravitational radiation damping . in the conservative dynamics of the binary , wherein there is no dissipation , the energy is expressed as a post - newtonian expansion in @xmath10 , with the dynamics involving only even powers of @xmath8 .",
    "when radiation reaction is added to the dynamics , then the equation of motion will have terms of both odd and even powers of @xmath8 .",
    "the radiation reaction is a correction to the dynamics that first appears at the 2.5pn ( i.e. @xmath11 ) order and not at 1pn or 1.5pn order .",
    "it is possible to construct the phasing of gws from the direct integration of the equations of motion , without relying on the adiabatic approximation . at leading order , the _ standard non - adiabatic _ approximant uses the 0pn and 2.5pn terms in the acceleration ( equivalent to using newtonian conserved energy and quadrupolar flux ) , neglecting the intervening 1pn and 2pn terms .",
    "but a complete treatment of the acceleration at leading order should include _ all _ terms up to 2.5pn , without any gaps .",
    "we define the phasing of the gws constructed in this approximation as the _ complete non - adiabatic _ approximant .",
    "in the _ adiabatic _ approximation , the energy / flux functions can be thought of as carrying the information of the conservative / radiative dynamics of the system .",
    "so it is possible to construct adiabatic variants of _ standard _ and _ complete non - adiabatic _ approximants entirely based on energy and flux functions . in this sense , _ standard adiabatic _ approximation is equivalent to neglecting certain conservative terms in the acceleration and thus resulting in gaps in the dynamics . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have proposed a new _ complete adiabatic _ approximant based on energy and flux functions . at the leading order",
    ", it uses the 2pn energy function instead of the 0pn energy function so that , heuristically , no intermediate post - newtonian terms in the acceleration are missed . following the notation used in ref .",
    "@xcite , we denote the _ standard adiabatic _ approximant at @xmath12pn order as @xmath13},{\\cal f}_{n})$ ] and the corresponding _ complete adiabatic _ approximant as @xmath14},{\\cal f}_{n})$ ] , where @xmath15 $ ] denotes the integer part of @xmath16 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the performance of the standard and complete approximants was evaluated in terms of their _ effectualness _ and _ faithfulness _ @xcite .",
    "we first investigated the problem as a general mathematical question concerning the nature of pn templates assuming a flat power spectrum for the detector noise .",
    "we then repeated the study using the initial ligo noise spectrum .",
    "it was found that , at low ( @xmath03pn ) pn orders the complete approximants bring about a remarkable improvement over the standard approximants for the construction of _ effectual _ templates .",
    "however , the standard approximants are nearly as good as the complete approximants at higher orders . in terms of the faithfulness",
    ", it was again found that the complete approximants generally performed better than the standard approximants .    in the present study",
    ", we assess the relative performances of the standard and complete adiabatic approximants for the virgo and advanced ligo noise spectra , as characterized by effectualness and faithfulness .",
    "we first perform this for the case of test - mass templates by comparing them with an exact waveform calculated in the adiabatic approximation of a test mass falling in to a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "we then explore the extension of the results to the comparable mass case , where the approximants are compared with a fiducial exact waveform .",
    "we restrict our study to the inspiral phase of the coalescing binary , neglecting the plunge and quasi - normal ring down phases .",
    "the one - sided noise power spectral density ( psd ) of virgo is given in terms of a dimensionless frequency @xmath17 by @xcite @xmath18\\ ] ] where @xmath19 hz ; while the same for the advanced ligo reads @xcite @xmath20\\ ] ] where @xmath21 hz .",
    "in the case of a test - particle orbiting a schwarzschild black hole , the energy function @xmath2 is exactly calculable analytically , while the flux function @xmath3 is exactly calculable numerically @xcite .",
    "we use these functions to construct the exact waveform in the adiabatic approximation .",
    "the analytical exact energy function can be taylor - expanded to get the approximants of the energy function .",
    "in addition , @xmath3 has been calculated analytically to 5.5pn order  @xcite by black hole perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "these approximants of energy and flux function are used to construct the approximate templates . in this study",
    ", we restrict to taylort1 approximants , since they do not involve any further re - expansion in the phasing formula .",
    "hence there is no ambiguity in constructing the phasing of the waveforms using approximants with unequal orders of the energy and flux functions as required for the complete adiabatic approximant .",
    "the exact waveform is also constructed by the taylort1 method .",
    "the waveforms ( both the exact and approximate ) are all terminated at @xmath22 which corresponds to @xmath23 hz for the @xmath24 binary and @xmath25 hz for the @xmath26 binary .",
    "the lower frequency cut - off of the waveforms is chosen to be @xmath27 hz .",
    "the effectualness and faithfulness of various pn templates for two archetypical binaries with component masses ( @xmath28 ) and ( @xmath29 ) are tabulated in tables [ table : effect - tm ] and [ table : faith - tm ] .",
    "all the results are in perfect agreement with the results of our earlier study @xcite using the initial ligo noise spectrum .",
    "complete adiabatic approximants bring about a remarkable improvement in the effectualness for all systems at low pn orders ( @xmath0 3pn ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the difference in effectualness between the standard and complete adiabatic approximants at orders greater than 3pn is very small .",
    "thus , we conclude that _ standard adiabatic approximants of order @xmath1 3pn are as good as the complete adiabatic approximants for the construction of effectual templates_. this study also confirms our earlier observation @xcite that complete adiabatic approximants are generally less ` biased ' in estimating the parameters of the binary .",
    "faithfulness of complete adiabatic approximants is generally better at all pn orders ( even at very high orders ) studied , which suggests that the complete approximants are closer to the exact solution than the corresponding standard approximants .",

    "* faithfulness of complete adiabatic approximants is generally better at all pn orders studied .",

    "we have shown that , at these pn orders ( 0pn , 1.5pn , 2pn and 3pn ) the early inspiral is better modelled by the standard approximants than the corresponding complete approximants , which explains the better faithfulness exhibited by the standard approximants at these orders .",
    "but complete adiabatic approximants are far superior to the standard adiabatic approximants in modelling the final inspiral .",
    "* complete adiabatic approximants are generally less ` biased ' in estimating the parameters of the binary .",
    "* in the case of comparable - mass binaries , standard adiabatic approximants of order @xmath1 1.5pn provides a good lower - bound to the complete adiabatic approximants for the construction of both effectual and faithful templates . * in the comparable - mass case , standard adiabatic approximants of order 2pn/3pn produce the target value @xmath34 in effectualness ( corresponding to 10% event - loss ) in the case of the bh - bh / ns - ns binaries ."
