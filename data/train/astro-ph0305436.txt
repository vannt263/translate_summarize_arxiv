    "an important  next step \" in the field of extrasolar planet research will be to characterize their atmospheres .",
    "the close - in extrasolar giant planets ( cegps ) will be the first targets ; indeed , the tentative detection of na i in hd 209458b has been reported ( charbonneau et al . 2002 ) .",
    "old cool stars ( like most known cegp hosts ) all have very small fractional linear polarization ( lp ; e.g. , leroy 1993 ) . at the same time , lp measurements are quite sensitive to the properties of scatterers in a planetary atmosphere , and the lp ( as a fraction of the planet s total reflected light ) can be significant ( e.g. , seager , whitney & sasselov 2000 [ = sws ] ) .",
    "thus , lp observations of exoplanets can potentially greatly reduce the star - planet contrast and yield useful data on cegp atmospheres .",
    "since observations will be of the exoplanet - parent star system , it is important to estimate the lp from the host star as well . in the absence of dust disks , lp from cool older stars",
    "is dominated by the ",
    "magnetic intensification \" effect from optically thick lines in a magnetic field ( leroy 1962 ) .",
    "this magnetic lp has distinctive wavelength and rotational phase properties ( huovelin & saar 1991 ; saar & huovelin 1993 ) .",
    "we use the models of saar & huovelin ( 1993 ) together with active region area estimates from saar ( 1996 ) to estimate the maximum broadband lp ( blp ) for selected cegp host stars .",
    "results are in agreement ( within the large observational errors ) with observed values from leroy ( 1993 ; fig .",
    "1 ) ; typically , blp from the host star is on the order of 10@xmath3 .",
    "we model the planetary blp as in sws .",
    "our fiducial model cegp is @xmath4=0.05 au from its star , with a radius of @xmath5 , and a gravity @xmath6 = 3.2 .",
    "it is covered by a uniform mgsio@xmath7 cloud , two pressure scale heights thick , with a log - normal particle size distribution having mean radii of @xmath8 m and @xmath9 m .",
    "the associated scattering phase and lp probability functions are given in figure 2 .",
    "for comparison , we also computed the same functions for fe and al@xmath10o@xmath7 particles ( fig .",
    "3 ) and a rayleigh scattering model ( fig .",
    "4 ) . figure 2 also shows results of the monte - carlo scattering simulation ( see sws for details ) , the light , and the lp phase curves .",
    "these results show lp measurements can better discriminate atmospheric properties than the light curve for several reasons :    * the light curve largely reflects geometric ( % illumination ) effects ( fig .",
    "2b ) , while for fractional lp ( the ratio of polarized to white light ) , these effects cancel out ( fig .",
    "* multiple scattering smooths the light curve , blurring features distinctive to particular particles ( fig .",
    "the lp curve , which is dominated by single scattering , is much less affected in this regard ( fig .",
    "* lp measurements are inherently more sensitive to the composition ( e.g. , fig .",
    "3 ) , size , and shape of particles than the light curve .",
    "lp observations of cegps will be quite difficult ; our fiducial model suggests lp of @xmath1120 - 40% of the reflected cegp light at best ( fig .",
    "but considerable diagnostic information is gained for this extra detection difficulty , and the contrast between star and planet is improved ( in the @xmath12 band ) from @xmath13(cegp)/@xmath13(star ) @xmath14 ( fig .",
    "2b ) to @xmath15(cegp)/@xmath15(star ) @xmath16 ( few@xmath17)/(few @xmath18 , i.e. , a factor of @xmath19 .",
    "the contrast improvement , and differential nature of the lp measurement , should aid detection at these low flux levels .",
    "detection could be carried out by blp polarimetry : searching for a weak ( few % of the total ) @xmath15 signal phased to the planet s orbital period .",
    "this method would work best in systems which are not tidally locked ( e.g. , @xmath20 and ) .",
    "another method would be to obtain lp spectra and use some multi - line method to detect the reflected , doppler shifted spectrum ( e.g. , collier - cameron et al .",
    "the two spectra will be quite distinctive : the star will display an lp spectrum with lines characteristic of those in strong magnetic fields ( i.e. , stokes q and u profiles ) , while the planet will display a reflected ( and linearly polarized in the process ) spectrum of the star , and thus appear as a copy of the _ unpolarized _ stellar spectrum ( stokes i ) . the striking difference between the two superposed spectra",
    "should aid the identification of the exoplanet s signature .",
    "sensitive polarimeters and lp - capable spectrographs on large telescopes may make such observations feasible in the near future ."
