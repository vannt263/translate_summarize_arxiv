    ", mobile data traffic is explosively and continuously rising due to smart phone and tablet users and it is expected that next - generation ( a.k.a . the 5th generation )",
    "cellular networks will offer a 1000x increase in network capacity as well as a 1000x increase in energy - efficiency in the following decade to meet such an excessively high user demand @xcite .",
    "the most prominent way to increase the network capacity is the _ network densification _",
    "@xcite by either implementing more antennas at base stations ( bss ) called large - scale antenna system ( lsas ) @xcite or adding more small cells at hot spot areas called ultra - dense network ( udn ) @xcite . by using a lot of antennas at each bs",
    ", the lsas can exploit massive spatial dimension to generate a sharp beam and thus it can provide higher spectral efficiency and also lower power consumption @xcite .",
    "however , the performance of the lsas is highly limited by the accuracy of channel state information ( csi ) and varies over the geographical locations of users . on the other hand ,",
    "the udn exploits spatial reuse obtained from deploying more small bss so that it can offer geographically uniform performance to each user due to the reduction of the access distance between users and bss @xcite , @xcite",
    ". however , its performance is limited by uncoordinated out - of - cell interference so that an efficient interference management is a key challenge for the udn , while managing the costs in terms of the front / backhaul overhead and computational complexity for a network operator .    large - scale cloud radio access network ( ls - cran ) is recently regarded as a novel wireless cellular network architecture to unify the above two architectures and is able to implement the interference handling mechanisms introduced for the long - term evolution ( lte ) or lte - advanced , such as the enhanced inter - cell interference coordination @xcite and the coordinated multi - point transmission @xcite , @xcite . in the ls - cran",
    ", lots of bss each with a massive antenna array are connected to a virtualized central processing unit ( cpu ) via dedicated front / backhaul link and some of the baseband processing functionality of each bs is migrated to the cpu . as a result , it is expected that the performance of the ls - cran is much higher than that of a conventional network .",
    "a natural objective of the ls - cran is to maximize the number of supporting users while preserving their quality - of - service ( qos ) requirements under practical constraints .",
    "if the ls - cran can manage the inter - user interference and inter - bs interference ideally , the network can be transformed into a multi - access ( ul ) or broadcast ( dl ) channel without any interference @xcite . however , unfortunately in practical systems , such an ideal situation is hard to be realized due to various practical limitations so that the maximum number of supporting users with a qos requirement is carefully considered under such practical constraints .",
    "there are three dominant practical constraints in the ls - cran .",
    "first , the network total transmit power should be maintained at an appropriate level not only for saving power consumption ( and operating cost ) @xcite , but also for adopting cheap radio - frequency ( rf ) components in each bs and user @xcite .",
    "second , the capacity of the front / backhaul links connecting the bss and the cpu is usually limited as pointed out in @xcite and installing dedicated high - capacity front / backhaul link for every bs causes too much cost , especially in a dense deployment @xcite .",
    "last , the pilot resource for the ls - cran to acquire the csi and handle the interference caused from a large number of bss , antennas , and users by using the maximum ratio transmission ( mrt ) @xcite or the zero - forcing ( zf ) @xcite operation , needs to be limited .",
    "then , a naturally raised question is that how many users can be supported by the ls - cran with a qos requirement under these three practical constraints ?",
    "also , how do the target qos and the number of users satisfying the target qos simultaneously grow as the network size increases ?",
    "the answers are ready to be addressed in this paper .",
    "although the performance of an ls - cran has been widely investigated in literature @xcite , @xcite via simulations , an intuitive analytic result considering practical limitations is not available yet .",
    "the exact distribution of the signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) of the mrt or zf operation is derived in @xcite for the case of two distributed bss and its laplace approximated distribution is derived in @xmath2 for a general ls - cran . in @xcite , a simpler form of the sinr distribution is derived by approximating the sinr as a gamma random variable . as parallel works ,",
    "the average achievable rate of the mrt or zf operation is derived in @xcite for a single bs case , and in @xcite for the case of fully - distributed or fully - colocated antennas as a function of the bs and user locations . in order to understand the network behavior",
    "more intuitively , stochastic geometry has been recently adopted to remove such dependency and describe important network metrics in a probabilistic way . in @xcite-@xcite ,",
    "the sinr distributions of cooperative transmission schemes are provided by adopting stochastic geometry , but the analysis resorts on multiple numerical integrals . in @xcite , an asymptotic analysis on the tail of the sinr distribution",
    "is provided by applying large - deviation theory and stochastic geometry . in @xcite ,",
    "the average achievable rate of the mrt and zf successive interference cancellation is investigated and its scaling laws are obtained in a dense random network with multiple receive antennas . however , the effects of the limited transmit power , the limited front / backhaul capacity , or the limited pilot resource have not been jointly considered .    as the network is densified",
    ", the effect of erroneous csi becomes more crucial because all of users and antennas are jointly processed in the cpu so that small csi error can dramatically degrade the overall network performance . in an ls - cran , there exist three main sources causing erroneous csi : the limited transmit power or the limited pilot resource in the process of csi acquisition and the limited capacity of front / backhaul links . in @xcite , the effect of the csi acquisition error on the energy and spectral efficiency is analyzed for the dl single - cell lsas using the mrt or zf operation . in @xcite , an information - theoretic capacity bound is derived for ul cran by modeling the csi error as an additive gaussian noise . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the average achievable rate and its asymptotic analysis are obtained in multi - antenna relay networks by considering the effect of the csi acquisition errors . in @xcite , authors model and study the front / backhaul link by using stochastic geometry .",
    "the achievable rate with various front / backhaul data compression strategies is analyzed in the ul scenario @xcite and this result is extended to the dl scenario @xcite . in @xcite , the achievable rate of a cooperative transmission scheme is derived by considering backhaul burdens .",
    "however , these results become quite intractable if applied to the ls - cran with large number of antennas and users so that more insightful and intuitive analysis for the ls - cran is required .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to characterize the asymptotic behavior of the ls - cran under three practical constraints : ( 1 ) the limited total transmit power , ( 2 ) the limited front / backhaul capacity , and ( 3 ) the limited pilot resource .",
    "the major contributions of this paper are summarized as follows .    *",
    "the scaling exponents of the signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) defined and derived as a function of the numbers of bs , bs antennas , and single - antenna users , and the ul / dl transmit power for the interference - free ( if ) , mrt , and zf operations , which are stated in theorems 1 - 3 . * based on the derived scaling exponents , four fundamental regimes are distinguished according to the ul transmit power ( or the csi acquisition error ) : ( i ) the extremely high ( ul transmission ) power regime ( ) , ( ii ) the high power regime ( ) , ( iii ) the medium power regime ( ) , and ( iv ) the low power regime ( ) .",
    "the scaling exponents of the three operations are derived according to the four regimes with insightful discussions .",
    "* the limited front / backhaul capacity can be successfully transformed into partial associations , where each bs serves only users affordable with its front / backhaul capacity .",
    "the analytical result shows that such limited front / backhaul capacity and pilot resource constrain the network behavior in a similar way as the limited transmit power , as stated in theorems 4 and 5 . *",
    "in order to characterize the network - wise performance of the ls - cran , we define the number of supportable users as the maximum number of users satisfying a pre - determined sinr requirement .",
    "then , we derive the tradeoff in the scaling exponents of them as the network size increases under the practical limitations , as stated in theorem 6 .",
    "the reminder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the ls - cran system model is described and the scaling exponent of the sinr is defined as a network performance measure .",
    "section iii provides some candidate operations suitable for practical implementation and the corresponding scaling exponents are analyzed by considering practical limitations to provide an intuitive understanding on the ls - cran in section iv . in section",
    "v , the number of supportable users is defined as another important network metric and analyzed to provide an insight on the asymptotic network behavior of the ls - cran .",
