    "<S> _ percolation ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) is a natural concept that emerges in the description of spreading processes in the presence of medium imperfections . </S>",
    "<S> percolation effects in quantum networks have recently been the subject of increasing interest @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most of the attention has been restricted to the generation of large scale networks with maximally entangled states between elementary nodes to allow for quantum communication applications , starting from initial imperfect , _ i.e. _ non - maximally entangled state networks . </S>",
    "<S> the interesting central new insight introduced in @xcite is that local quantum operations may be used not only to purify entanglement but , simultaneously , to change the topology of the lattice to a new one with lower percolation probability threshold . </S>",
    "<S> this idea has been developed for different states @xcite and lattice dimensions @xcite . in a different context </S>",
    "<S> , percolation concepts also appeared in quantum information theory ( qit ) in the study of cluster state generation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the capacity of a network determines its utility in the domain of communication . </S>",
    "<S> the development of qit has led to the uncovering of interesting quantum effects on channel capacities , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ superadditivity of quantum ( q - type ) channel capacity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this result followed the intuition developed in the bound entanglement activation effect @xcite ( where two weak resources activate each other becoming collectively useful for some task ) continued further in refs . @xcite and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> independently , the first superadditivity effect of classical ( c - type ) capacity in quantum multi - access channels has been described @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both q - type and c - type superadditivities have been proven even for entanglement breaking channels @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we consider percolation effects in quantum networks from a channel perspective . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that channel superadditivity can be used to enhance percolation of information through networks . </S>",
    "<S> the schemes are based on network models of classical information transfer through quantum multipartite channels ( macs ) , which can be mapped to certain types of _ directed _ bond percolation problems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we first consider a simple layered communication scheme ( a ) to demonstrate the basic idea of percolation assisted by superadditive capacities and then describe a more complicated scheme of multidirectional communication ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the percolation problem in case b does not seem to have been studied elsewhere in the literature .    </S>",
    "<S> the basic ingredients of the quantum networks are : a _ passive _ fixed underlying network built up of elementary entanglement breaking macs , and an _ active _ auxiliary incomplete network consisting of randomly generated ( open ) bonds . </S>",
    "<S> the term passive means that no bond in the network allows _ a - priori _ high capacity communication ( hcc ) , whereas elements of the active network are high capacity channels . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the active channels can serve to activate hcc through the passive channels .     </S>",
    "<S> model a - layered communication network : a ) passive network ; users are located at nodes of a square lattice , the lattice is filled with butterfly shaped primitives , information flow is directed from layer @xmath0 ; b ) butterfly primitive consists of two macs ( solid and dashed wedges ) from ref .  </S>",

    "<S> _ the elementary channel of the passive network is chosen in this paper as a 2-sender 1-receiver _ noisy _ quantum mac depicted as the wedge shaped channels in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : model_a](b ) : the slanted line is a two - qudit ( @xmath5dimensional ) input pertaining to one user ; the vertical line is a single qudit input of the second user . </S>",
    "<S> the single qudit system is modified by one of a chosen set of ( orthogonal ) @xmath5 unitary operations fired by the logical value of the two - qudit system ( see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> this single qudit line is further modified by a depolarizing channel and is the sole output system at the receiver s end . for moderate to large depolarization  the working regime considered here  this channel has poor classical capacity @xmath6 for any user @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the maximal attainable capacity for a single qudit output , corresponding to an identity channel . </S>",
    "<S> communication can be improved by adding a high capacity active channel , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ an ideal channel , along the vertical transmission line . </S>",
    "<S> inputting a two - party maximally entangled state to the ideal channel and vertical line of a wedge channel increases the capacity along the slanted line of the wedge channel to a much higher value @xmath9 ( see eq.([rpab ] ) )  a manifestation of superadditivity of channel capacities @xcite ( for high depolarization when the channel becomes entanglement breaking , @xmath10 @xcite ) . we define hcc as transmission at a rate @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> the structure of the wedge channel induces a sense of direction of communication . in the network context </S>",
    "<S> , we first consider the scenario where only forward communication is allowed ( see fig.[fig : model_a ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the passive channel inputs are shared by nearest neighbour pairs of sites in horizontal layers giving rise to a butterfly shaped fixed network . </S>",
    "<S> the active channels are only placed on vertical bonds . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that these are available with probability @xmath12  one can assume that identity channels are initially available at all vertical bonds , yet due to fragility w.r.t . </S>",
    "<S> noise either remain useful ( ideal ) with probability @xmath12 or become unuseful random operations with probability @xmath13 effectively erasing information . in our scheme </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a setup where a triple of identity channels is the basic active channel @xcite this allows the possibility of simultaneous hcc between a given sender and his vertically placed receiver as well as between the sender s two horizontal nearest neighbours and that receiver ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : model_a ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the question of establishing long range hcc in such a network is a directed percolation problem . </S>",
    "<S> one asks , under what conditions , is it possible for any user to be able to perform directed hcc , through intermediate nodes , with a user or users located at a distance scaling with the length of the network . </S>",
    "<S> one may compare two scenarios - ( a ) entanglement - free or classical , where no entanglement is allowed in the protocol used at any node and ( b ) entanglement - assisted ( ea ) , which takes full advantage of the superadditive effect described earlier . </S>",
    "<S> the former case corresponds to communication only along 1dimensional paths and the percolation threshold probability is @xmath14 , rendering the network useless for hcc for finite loss probability of active channels . </S>",
    "<S> the ea scheme involves changing the geometry of the hcc network and is mapped to a _ correlated _ directed bond percolation problem where with probability @xmath12 three directed bonds ( forming an arrow shape ) are placed on the lattice ( fig.[fig : model_a](e ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the threshold probability is significantly suppressed due to entanglement induced increased connectivity . </S>",
    "<S> we performed a standard monte carlo simulation ( see @xcite ) and found the percolation threshold to be @xmath15 with accuracy @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked that the studied percolation transition lies , as expected , in the directed percolation ( dp ) universality class , by computing a complete set of critical exponents and found them to be in agreement with those obtained for the uncorrelated directed bond percolation problem . </S>",
    "<S> the important basic characteristic of directed percolation is that the connected clusters of nodes are geometrically highly asymmetrical and are restricted to acute cones ( with cone angle @xmath17 when @xmath18 ) with axes along the vertical lines passing through the starting nodes . near the critical point the clusters are very narrow and essentially quasi 1-dimensional , as the probability of obtaining a connection with a site a large distance away from the source and at an angle @xmath19 from the axis , @xmath20 for @xmath21 ( see _ e.g. _ dhar and barma @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ea scheme beats the classical scheme in that there is a wide window in @xmath12 for hcc , and that the horizontal extent of connections @xmath22 at a distance @xmath23 away changes from @xmath24 to @xmath25 as @xmath12 increases from @xmath26 to 1 .     for percolation process on randomly oriented square lattice ( classical scheme ) and butterfly network ( ea scheme ) . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : rys_3_model_b+activation ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> now each node can communicate in _ both _ directions with its nearest neighbours ( main bonds ) on a square lattice as well as all of its next nearest neighbours ( diagonal bonds ) through the passive network . </S>",
    "<S> the configuration leading to this possibility is shown in fig.[fig : rys_3_model_b+activation ] ( a ) and ( b ) . </S>",

    "<S> hcc between distant nodes is now a multidirectional bond percolation problem . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the case where upward , left - to - right oriented identities are present with probability @xmath28 while downward , right - to - left oriented identities are placed with probability @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> note , that bidirectional bonds appear as the independent choice of two oppositely directed channels on a given bond .    </S>",
    "<S> this setup is interesting already for the case when , say , @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> using an entanglement free protocol , capacity @xmath31 can already be obtained through the main bonds of the square lattice along the up or right directions , in contrast to model a. this is the well known square lattice directed bond percolation problem for which the percolation threshold @xmath32 ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> but , in the ea scheme , due to increased and correlated connectivity , the percolation threshold is almost halved w.r.t . </S>",
    "<S> the classical scheme and has been calculated here to be @xmath33 . </S>",

    "<S> the general multidirectional communication problem is the most interesting setup . in the classical scenario , </S>",
    "<S> this reduces to square lattice randomly oriented percolation . </S>",
    "<S> problems of this category were studied in the context of random resistor diode networks ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) mainly using renormalization group calculations . </S>",
    "<S> however not many results seem to be available in the literature on the @xmath37 percolation problem ( see however @xcite for some analytical properties ) .    here , we map out the phase diagram in the @xmath38 plane in fig.[fig : perctresmodelb-3.0 ] using monte carlo simulations ( see appendix ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the diagram is symmetrical w.r.t . </S>",
    "<S> the line @xmath39 due to system symmetry under the interchange @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> this result is to be compared with the multidirectional correlated bond percolation phase diagram for the ea scheme ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : rys_3_model_b+activation](d ) ) . as can be seen in fig.[fig : perctresmodelb-3.0 ] , the ea scheme is drastically better than the classical scheme in the whole parameter plane .    </S>",
    "<S> an interesting feature of both schemes is that they allow switching of universality classes of phase transitions from the dp class to the isotropic percolation ( ip ) class to which standard bond / site percolation belongs . </S>",
    "<S> this is facilitated by the choice of parameters @xmath37 , and as a result one may accordingly change the properties of the long range clusters . to provide evidence for this , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate two universal critical exponents ( fig . [ fig4 ] ) @xmath27 and the fisher exponent @xmath41 ( see @xcite ) as one moves along the critical lines ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : perctresmodelb-3.0 ] ) of the two models . </S>",
    "<S> recall , that @xmath27 determines how the percolation probability @xmath42 increases above the percolation threshold , while the fisher exponent determines how the probability of obtaining a cluster larger than size @xmath43 decreases with @xmath43 at the critical point @xmath44 : @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the values of these exponents in the dp class are @xmath46 @xcite and in ip : @xmath47 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first consider square lattice multidirectional percolation in fig.[fig4 ] ( the classical scheme ) . </S>",
    "<S> both exponents show that as one moves along the critical line , the phase transitions lie in the dp universality class until @xmath48 , since this region inherits the exponents at the dp point @xmath49 . at @xmath50 , which is an isotropic symmetry point , </S>",
    "<S> one obtains values of the exponents corresponding to the ip universality class . in between </S>",
    "<S> , there is a characteristic crossover region between the two types of behaviour . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , this means that for a choice of parameters approaching the isotropic point , one obtains different characteristic growth of clusters ( determined by different critical exponents ) than when in the dp region . secondly the cluster geometrical characteristics change from highly anisotropic to isotropic . </S>",
    "<S> the butterfly network percolation problem ( ea scheme ) basically follows the same pattern ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ) and can be considered a rescaled version of the classical problem , wherein again lies the quantum advantage of the ea scheme . for this network , </S>",
    "<S> the isotropy point is found to be located at @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the slightly lower values of @xmath27 in the dp regime as compared to the square lattice problem do not seem to be significant - and are a result of the extreme sensitivity of the calculated exponents on the accuracy of critical probabilities .    _ concluding remarks . </S>",
    "<S> _ we have described percolation effects in a channel context showing how directed percolation effects ( not considered before ) emerge in the consideration of quantum networks . in the context of percolation theory , to our knowledge , the multidirectional correlated bond percolation problem has not been studied before . </S>",
    "<S> finally , quite remarkably , our results provide a new entanglement percolation effect in the spirit of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . keeping everything else unchanged , </S>",
    "<S> consider the bell measurement ( bm ) channel of fig . 1 of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite instead of the mac used here , with ac ( bc ) playing the role of diagonal ( resp . </S>",
    "<S> vertical ) bond of the square lattice . </S>",
    "<S> then any randomly generated singlet between b and c can be switched , via entanglement swapping , to a singlet on the diagonal ac . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the same geometry as discussed here but now one asks about the possibility of building a long range network of singlets . </S>",
    "<S> note that singlets are directionless . without using the bm channel </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a `` classical '' scheme related to square lattice percolation which has threshold @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> since directionless percolation must certainly be at least as good as directed percolation , an ea scheme making use of the switching mechanism of the bm channel will have threshold at most equal to the calculated threshold at the isotropic point of model b @xmath53 .    </S>",
