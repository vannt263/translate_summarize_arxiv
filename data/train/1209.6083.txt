    "light extra u(1 ) gauge bosons appear very naturally in well - motivated extensions of the standard model ( sm ) . even if the paradigm of a highly symmetric high energy theory is to unify particles into representations of a large - rank local gauge group , the phenomenological fact that at low energies these large gauge symmetries are seemingly broken",
    "possibly leaves us with the existence of many lower rank symmetries .",
    "in particular u(1)s are potentially most numerous since they are the lowest - rank local symmetries .",
    "moreover , some of these u(1)s may be hidden , because the sm particles are not charged under them , and therefore escaped detection until now .",
    "most notably , such hidden sectors often occur in supersymmetric extensions or superstring embeddings of the sm  @xcite .",
    "on general grounds , the dominant interaction of hidden u(1 ) gauge bosons @xmath0 ( hidden sector photons , short hidden photons ) with the sm at low energies generically appears already at the dimension four level through kinetic mixing with the ordinary photon  @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the leading terms of the low energy effective lagrangian of the minimal hidden u(1 ) extension of the sm read , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the field strength of the hidden gauge field @xmath3 , @xmath4 the mass of the hidden photon , and @xmath5 the field strength of the ordinary electromagnetic gauge field .",
    "the hidden photon mass @xmath4 and the kinetic mixing parameter @xmath6 have to be determined either theoretically , by specifying an ultraviolet completion of the theory , or phenomenologically , by comparing with observations . in this context , two very interesting mass regions have been identified recently :    * @xmath7  mev : hidden photons in this mass range may explain the @xmath8 excess of dark radiation in the universe  @xcite , beyond the one from ordinary photons and neutrinos , reported by recent global cosmological analyses  @xcite .",

    "@xmath7  gev : hidden photons in this mass range may explain the observed @xmath9 deviation of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon  @xcite from the value expected in the sm  @xcite .",
    "moreover , they might explain possible terrestrial and cosmic ray dark matter anomalies  notably the possible direct detection of dark matter by dama  @xcite , cogent  @xcite and cresst  @xcite , in contrast to its nonobservation in cdms  @xcite and xenon  @xcite , and the observations of an excess in cosmic ray electrons and/or positrons observed by pamela  @xcite and fermi  @xcite  if dark matter resides in the hidden sector too and is charged under the hidden u(1 )  @xcite .",
