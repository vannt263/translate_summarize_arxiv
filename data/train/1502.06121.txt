    "<S> in this work we extend the etching model  @xcite to @xmath0 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> this permits us to investigate its exponents behaviour on higher dimensions , to try to verify the existence of an upper critical dimension for the kpz equations , with our results sugesting that @xmath1 is not an upper critical dimension for the etching model .    </S>",
    "<S> introduction    among the many equations describing the behaviour of moving surfaces , the kpz equation  @xcite is of special interest , partially motivated by the fact that it describes many physical phenomena , such as flame front propagation @xcite and deposition of thin films @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although its exponents in one dimension are long known  @xcite , the renormalization group technique used for obtaining its values is not usable for higher dimensions . as such , usualy </S>",
    "<S> either numerical simulations or approximate methods are used to obtain exponents for the kpz in higher dimensions , and even then numerical determination of exponents can be tricky  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> such methods give no final answer to the values of these exponents , which combined with the absence of exact solutions leads to the much debated possibility of an upper critical dimension ( ucd ) @xmath2 for the dynamic exponents@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one approach consisted of trying to find a general expression for the exponents depending on the substrate dimension @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> notable examples are those for the rsos model , by kim and kosterlitz  @xcite , for the eden model @xcite by kertsz and wolf , the heuristic approach to the strong - coupling regime by stepanow @xcite , a tentative method based on quantization of the exponents by lssig@xcite and a pertubation expansion of the kpz equation by bouchaud and cates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , further numerical results have shown these results to be incorrect  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> analytical methods such as mapping of the directed polymer @xcite , perturbation expansion @xcite and mode - coupling techniques @xcite among others @xcite observe @xmath7 . a asymptotic weak noise approach by fogedby @xcite suggests @xmath8 . otherwise , some numerical studies found no such limit @xcite , as well as the numerical and theoretical results by scharwartz and perlsman @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we present in this work a version of the etching model by mello et al  @xcite extended to work with @xmath0 spatial dimensions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the one dimensional version of the etching model is known to be compatible with the kpz equation , and as such , is classified in the kpz universality class .    using this version of the model </S>",
    "<S> , we determine exponents for surfaces with @xmath9 , reaching the conclusion that if there is a ucd , it must be such that @xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> the etching model in @xmath3 dimensions    proposed by mello et al  @xcite in 2001 , the etching model simulates a one dimensional crystalline solid submerged in a solvent liquid . </S>",
    "<S> its scaling exponents are very close to those of the kpz equation , namely @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and as such , it is believed do belong to the kpz universality class . this model was object of extensive research in recent years  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we extend the model to @xmath0 dimensions , considering the solid a square lattice exposed to the solvent liquid , with a removal probability proportional to the exposed area . </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm can be described as    1 .   at discrete instant @xmath13 </S>",
    "<S> one horizontal site @xmath14 is randomly chosen ; 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 ; 3 .   if @xmath16 , do @xmath17 , where @xmath18 are the first neighbours .    in the multidimensional version @xmath19 and @xmath20 </S>",
    "<S> are vectors and @xmath20 runs over the @xmath21 first neighbours of the hypercube . </S>",
    "<S> we consider @xmath22 to be the substrate length in each direction , with the total number of sites is @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the normalized time @xmath24 defines the time unity as @xmath23 cellular automata iterations , i.e. , @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> we use periodic boundary conditions on the surface to reduce unwanted finite size length effects . </S>",
    "<S> albeit the model is not a direct mapping of the kpz equation , it generally mimics its dynamics and reproduces its exponents for @xmath26 as well as the general case @xmath0 .     from the etching model as a function of time , for surfaces with ( a ) @xmath27 , ( b ) @xmath28 , ( c ) @xmath29 , ( d ) @xmath1 , ( e ) @xmath30 , and ( f ) @xmath31 , showing only data points for @xmath32 for clarity . </S>",

    "<S> scalling @xcite is visible .    </S>",
    "<S> the family - vicsek scaling is a relation that can be used to model surface rougthness dynamics by considering it composed of two different regimes : one in which it grows in a power - law like function of time , and after a saturation time @xmath34 , it saturates . </S>",
    "<S> the values of the saturation roughness is related to the substrate length , with @xmath35 these properties are expressed in the fv relation : @xmath36    determination of exponents value    using the fv relation , we obtain our exponents by fitting our data to a set of power laws . </S>",
    "<S> we fit values of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 by using the two expressions of ( [ eq : fv ] ) at @xmath40 and @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> determination of @xmath34 is made by analysing the intersection between the functions of the aforementioned regimes .    </S>",
    "<S> the etching model presents a transient time at the beginning of the growth process , and as such data from these times where @xmath42 are discarded from the fitting . </S>",
    "<S> this implies in a @xmath43 that is not independent of @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , the parameter obtained from the fitting is called @xmath38 and a correction is made , in the form : @xmath44 where @xmath45 .    </S>",
    "<S> this correction considers the real value of @xmath43 to be the asymptotic of @xmath38 , eliminating finite size effects .    </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath34 for each value of @xmath3 and @xmath22 were obtained from roughness fitting and plotted in figure [ fig : dim_ws_tx_beta ] .    ) plotted as functions of @xmath22 with @xmath46 . </S>",

    "<S> on table [ table : dfg_results ] we show our results . </S>",
    "<S> it is simple to observe that the expected behaviour for a system with a ucd on @xmath7 is nowhere to be found , with all exponents continualy changing . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that there is not an ucd @xmath53 , in agreement with previous results @xcite obtained through other models .    </S>",

    "<S> a evidence of the precision of these exponents is the value of @xmath54 , which should be 2 . </S>",
    "<S> [ table : dfg_results ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is important to note that although the one dimensional etching model is on the kpz universality class , it is hard to classify it , or for that matter , any multi dimensional model , on the kpz universality class , as there are no known solutions for this case . we can , however , compare our results with with others @xcite , showing great concordance .    </S>",
    "<S> conclusion    we have made a generalized version of the etching model , capable of simulating surfaces on @xmath0 dimensions . using this version of the model </S>",
    "<S> , we were capable of obtaining exponents for systems up to @xmath33 dimensions .    throught the obtained exponents , we have shown that the etching model does not show a upper critical dimension at @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> it is not possible , however , to assert that the same thing is true to the kpz equation , as we still do not have a formal mapping of our model to the kpz equation , although comparison with current literature hints into the same general direction of both the etching model belonging to the kpz universality class and the absence of this ucd on the kpz equation .    </S>",
    "<S> we expect as well that importa results obtained in stochastic process @xcite could be used to give a more complete solution to this problem .    </S>",
