    "detailed examination of the process @xmath7 at the ilc is a crucial one for studying the electroweak gauge symmetry , in particular , electroweak symmetry breaking and the structure of the gauge sector in general , and allows to observe a manifestation of new physics ( np ) that may appear beyond the standard model ( sm ) . in the sm , the process ( [ proc1 ] ) is described by the amplitudes mediated by photon and @xmath2 boson exchange in the @xmath8-channel and by neutrino exchange in the @xmath9-channel .",
    "this reaction is quite sensitive to both the leptonic vertices and the trilinear couplings to @xmath10 of the sm @xmath2 and of any new heavy neutral boson or a new heavy lepton that can be exchanged in the @xmath8-channel or @xmath9-channel , respectively . a popular example in this regard ,",
    "is represented by @xmath1 models @xcite . in particular ,",
    "an effective @xmath11 model , which originates from the breaking of the exceptional group @xmath1 , leads to extra gauge bosons . indeed , in the breaking of this group down to the sm symmetry , two additional neutral gauge bosons could appear and the lightest @xmath3 is defined as @xmath12 and can be parametrized in terms of the hypercharges of the two groups @xmath13 and @xmath14 which are involved in the breaking of the @xmath1 group into a low - energy group of rank 6 : @xmath15 for a sufficiently large vacuum expectation value of the higgs field an effective rank-5 model , which leads to the decomposition ( see , for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath16 can be deduced from the rank-6 model ( see below ) so that one of the new gauge bosons decouples from low energy phenomenology .",
    "the remaining ( lighter ) new gauge bosons @xmath3 is in general a mixture of @xmath17 and @xmath18 and is assumed to lead to measurable effects at the collider , and an angle @xmath19 specifies the orientation of the @xmath20 generator in the @xmath1 group space , where the values @xmath21 and @xmath22 would correspond , respectively , to pure @xmath23 and @xmath24 bosons , while the value @xmath25 would correspond to a @xmath26 boson originating from the direct breaking of @xmath1 to a rank-5 group in superstring inspired models .",
    "another characteristic of extended models , apart from the @xmath3 , is the existence of new matter , new heavy leptons and quarks . in @xmath1 models",
    "the fermion sector is enlarged , since the matter multiplets are in larger representations ( the @xmath27 fundamental representation ) , that contains , in particular , a vector doublet of leptons . from the phenomenological point of view",
    "it is convenient to classify the fermions present in @xmath1 in terms of their transformation properties under @xmath28 .",
    "we denote the particles with unconventional isospin assignments ( right - handed doublets ) as exotic fermions .",
    "we here consider two heavy left- and right - handed @xmath28 exotic lepton doublets @xcite @xmath29 and one @xmath3 boson , with masses larger than @xmath30 and coupling constants that may be different from those of the sm .",
    "these leptons are called _ vector leptons _ because both the left- and right- handed components transform identically under @xmath28 .",
    "we also assume that the new , `` exotic '' fermions only mix with the standard ones within the same family ( the electron and its neutrino being the ones relevant to process ( [ proc1 ] ) ) , which assures the absence of tree - level generation - changing neutral currents @xcite .",
    "current lower limits on @xmath31 obtained from dilepton pair production at the lhc with @xmath32 and @xmath33 fb@xmath34  @xcite range in the interval @xmath35 , depending on the particular @xmath36 model being tested .",
    "already these masses are too high for a @xmath36 to be directly seen at the ilc .",
    "however , even at such high masses , @xmath36 exchanges can manifest themselves indirectly _ via _ deviations of cross sections , and in general of the reaction observables , from the sm predictions .    in this paper , we study the indirect effects induced by heavy lepton exchange in @xmath6 pair production ( [ proc1 ] ) at the ilc , with a center of mass energy @xmath37 and time - integrated luminosity of @xmath38  ab@xmath34",
    ". we also present results for a lower energy run at @xmath39 .",
    "for early papers on these effects , see refs .",
    "we allow for effects due to extra @xmath3 gauge boson exchange .",
    "indirect effects may be quite subtle , both when it comes to distinguishing an effect from the sm , and also as far as the identification of the source of an observed deviation is concerned , because _ a priori _ different np scenarios may lead to the same or similar experimental signatures .",
    "clearly , then , the discrimination of one np model ( in our case the @xmath1 ) from other possible ones needs an appropriate strategy for analyzing the data .",
    "recently , the problem of distinguishing the @xmath36 effects , once observed in process ( [ proc1 ] ) , from the anomalous gauge couplings , has been studied in @xcite . in the agc models",
    ", there is no new gauge boson exchange , but the @xmath40 , @xmath41 couplings are modified with respect to the sm values , this violates the sm gauge cancellation too and leads to deviations of the cross sections .",
    "we consider the cp - conserving set of such couplings , often referred to as @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "an alternative effective - field - theory approach to these effects was recently presented @xcite .    in this note",
    ", we extend the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , considering the possibility of uniquely identifying the effects of heavy neutral lepton exchange from @xmath2-@xmath3 mixing within the same class of @xmath1 models .",
    "this is relevant , since in this class of models lepton mixing and @xmath2-@xmath36 mixing can be simultaneously present .",
    "we also distinguish them from analogous ones due to competitor models with anomalous trilinear gauge couplings in the process ( [ proc1 ] ) by exploiting a double polarization asymmetry that will unambiguously identify the heavy exotic - lepton mixing effects - channel sneutrino exchange against other new physics scenarios described by contact - like effective interactions in high - energy @xmath4 annihilation into lepton pairs @xcite . ] and is only accessible with the availability of both beams being polarized @xcite .",
    "while the high precision observables determined at lep severely constrain the electroweak sector @xcite , they leave room for effects at the energies that are discussed here .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
