    "a neutral boron acceptor in silicon is able to weakly bind an extra hole , resulting in a positively charged ion ( b@xmath0 ) .",
    "this entity is an example of a positively charged acceptor , commonly denoted by a@xmath0 , which is the counter part of the better known negatively charged donor d@xmath2 .",
    "both are related to their atomic - physics analogue , the negative hydrogen ion h@xmath2 .",
    "the energy states associated with these ions are very shallow and spatially large .",
    "when their concentration is sufficiently high , their overlapping wave functions can form an upper hubbard band @xcite and they play an important role in electronic transport in semiconductors at low temperatures . since a few years , electronic states of individual dopant atoms gained renewed interest due to their prospective application in si - based solid state quantum computing @xcite .    neither theoretically nor experimentally much work has been done on the b@xmath0-state .",
    "optical spectroscopy is difficult due to the small ionization energy ( less than 2  mev @xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "the nature of its ground state is not well - established and to our knowledge no results have been published on the magnetic field dependence of the energy levels .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we present a general group - theoretical study of the magnetic field dependence of two - hole states in tetrahedral semiconductors . to our knowledge ,",
    "such an analysis has not been published before .",
    "second , because our analysis includes all possibilities for the b@xmath0 ground state , it enables us to compare our results with our recently published measurements of b@xmath0 in a magnetic field @xcite and to draw conclusions about the nature of the b@xmath0 ground state .",
    "the nature of the energy levels of a _",
    "neutral _ boron acceptor ( b@xmath3 ) in silicon is well - known @xcite and the zeeman effect in b@xmath3 has been studied in detail , both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "the b - impurity is located at substitutional sites of the tetrahedral silicon lattice .",
    "the ( one - hole ) ground - state is a 1@xmath4-like fourfold degenerate state that belongs to the @xmath5 representation of the tetrahedral double group @xmath6 ( for the nomenclature of representations used , see table  [ tab : chartd ] ) .",
    "the bound hole has total angular momentum @xmath7 .",
    "the single - hole wave function is the product of a 1@xmath4 hydrogen - like envelope function and a band - like function . due to spin - orbit interaction in silicon ,",
    "the @xmath8 valence band is split off by @xmath9  mev @xcite and does not need to be considered in first order .",

    "it is much more convenient to use the well - established approach of constructing an _ effective zeeman hamiltonian _ @xcite .",
    "this comprises the construction of a matrix of the required size , exploiting required symmetries to find vanishing elements and relations between elements .",
    "the result is a matrix that usually depends on a small number of unknown phenomenological parameters , in terms of which the level splitting can be expressed .",
    "this approach is especially advantageous in the present situation , where both the values of the parameters occurring in @xmath12 and the unperturbed wave functions are not ( exactly ) known .",
    "in this section , we will investigate the first order zeeman effect of all the double acceptor levels mentioned before .      because @xmath15 occurs in neither of the anti - symmetric direct products @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , the effective hamiltonian matrix @xmath18 vanishes identically for the three levels @xmath14 .",
    "hence , none of these levels experiences a linear zeeman effect .",
    "the linear part of the effective zeeman hamiltonian for a @xmath15 or @xmath19 level is given by @xcite @xmath20 here , @xmath21 is the bohr - magneton and @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are matrix representations of the components of the angular momentum operator with respect to some convenient basis . the components @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) transform according to the @xmath15 representation of @xmath6 .",

    "yields @xmath30 the eigenvalues are independent of the direction of the magnetic field and hence give rise to an isotropic splitting .",
    "the situation where the zero - field splitting of the @xmath31 level is small compared to the zeeman energy must be dealt with separately . because @xmath32 contains @xmath15 ,",
    "there are non vanishing cross - terms in the linear effective zeeman hamiltonian for a @xmath33-level .",
    "therefore , such a level will have a linear zeeman shift different from that of the individual @xmath34 and @xmath19 levels .",
    "the hamiltonian sub - matrix for the @xmath31 level is given by it is possible ( e.g. by using the coupling coefficients for @xmath35 as given in ref . and inverting ) to express all six possible products of @xmath34 and @xmath19 wave functions as a linear combination of @xmath15 and @xmath19 wave functions .",

    "for some of the levels we will also give a second order approach , using the quadratic part of the effective hamiltonian @xmath50 .",

    "conclusions can be drawn neither about the magnitude of @xmath53 nor about its sign ( that is , whether the state is diamagnetic or paramagnetic ) . because @xmath55 , a similar expression holds for a @xmath51 level .      for a @xmath34 level ,",

    "when @xmath63 , there is only one eigenvalue @xmath64 meaning that there is no splitting in second order and the quadratic shift is the same as for @xmath65 .",
    "finally , for @xmath66 , we find the eigenvalues @xmath67 the zeeman effect for this field direction is similar to @xmath61 , but the splitting is twice as small .      because the symmetrized squares of @xmath15 and @xmath19 satisfy @xmath68=[\\gamma_5\\times\\gamma_5]$ ] , the results for the @xmath15 and @xmath19 levels are similar .",

    "the zeeman effect of the levels treated so far is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bcalc ] .",
    "finally we discuss the zeeman effect for two - hole states in the central field approximation . in this approximation",
    ", we must start from the one - hole levels and their behavior in a magnetic field .",
    "the two - hole wave functions are anti - symmetrized products of one - hole wave functions and the energy levels are obtained by examining the various ways to put the two holes in the one - hole levels .",
    "we will present results for the case where both holes are put in a @xmath5 level and @xmath61 only .",
    "similar results for the other types of levels and other directions of the field are easily obtained in an analogous way .    for a magnetic field @xmath79 ,",
    "the single hole @xmath5 ground state is split into @xmath19 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath5-levels of @xmath82 @xcite . because holes are fermions , each of these non - degenerate levels can be occupied by at most one hole . by putting each of the two holes in a different level ,",
    "this gives rise to six two - hole levels @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 , where all representations are of @xmath82 .",
    "the energy shifts of the single - hole levels have been determined experimentally @xcite .",
    "the shifts of the two - hole levels can be calculated as the sum of the shifts of the individual single hole levels from which they are composed .",
    "this results in a linear shift for each two - hole level , given by @xmath89 , with @xmath90 for @xmath51 , @xmath91 for @xmath15 , @xmath92 for @xmath93 , @xmath94 for @xmath34 and @xmath95 for @xmath51 .",
    "the parameters @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the @xmath98-factors for the single hole @xmath7 and @xmath8-levels respectively . experimental values for b@xmath3 in si",
    "are @xmath99 and @xmath100 @xcite . in the above , a small overall shift is neglected .",
    "only states arising from @xmath101 ( see table  [ tab : twohole ] ) are candidates for the b@xmath0 ground state",
    ". these are @xmath1 , @xmath34 , @xmath19 , @xmath31 and the unsplit ( central field ) @xmath101 .",
    "each of these five possibilities for the b@xmath0 ground state will be compared to existing experimental data . from the previous section ,",
    "we conclude that all possible ground state levels behave qualitatively differently in a magnetic field .",
    "therefore , it is in principle possible to determine the nature of the actual ground state of b@xmath0 from the analysis of a sufficiently detailed experiment .",
    "though this approach is hampered by the fact that the value of the parameters are not known , it is possible to draw conclusions based on the qualitative characteristics , such as linear or quadratic splitting / shift and the asymmetry of the splitting .",
    "we refer to our recent experiments reported in ref .   and summarize the main observations .",
    "the ground state energy shifts upwards ( that is , in the direction of the valence band ) and is therefore diamagnetic .",
    "the shift has both a linear and a quadratic component .",
    "the total shift amounts to 1  mev at a magnetic field of 14  t and was equal for the @xmath102 and @xmath103 directions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bmeas ] ) .",
    "the width of the observed peak ( full width at half maximum ) increased from 1.2  mev to 1.5  mev in the same magnetic field range . within the experimental error ( @xmath104  mev ) ,",
    "no splitting of the peak was detected .- state .",
    "the interaction of a b@xmath0 state with neighboring b@xmath3 states is however not expected to change the nature of its ground state . ]",
    "the experimentally observed super linear overall shift , independent from the direction of @xmath13 , best matches the behavior of a @xmath1 state , although this leaves the strong linear component in the measured magnetic field dependence unexplained .",
    "therefore , we believe that the ground state of b@xmath0 is indeed a @xmath1 state .",
    "this hypothesis does imply that the observed linear component in the peak shift and the peak broadening are is due to other processes ( e.g.  the stark effect ) as already suggested in ref .  .",
    "the broadening in the observed peak is linear in the magnetic field and independent of its direction .",
    "therefore , it can not be explained as unresolved splitting of a @xmath34 level .",
    "a @xmath19 or @xmath31 ground state would give rise to linear splitting ( broadening ) , but no overall shift would be expected in first order .",
    "moreover , the magnitude of the splitting in a @xmath31 level would depend on the magnetic field direction .",
    "therefore , these possibilities are not consistent with the experimental observations .",
    "only when the parameter @xmath59 ( @xmath105 ) would much larger than all other relevant parameters ( that is @xmath106 or @xmath107 ) , the magnetic field dependence of the @xmath34 ( @xmath19 ) state would be similar to that of the @xmath1 state . in that case ,",
    "@xmath34 , @xmath19 and @xmath31 states can not be rejected as potential ground state symmetries for b@xmath0 .",
    "the central field approach is unlikely to yield good results for b@xmath0 , for which the wave functions of the two holes are expected to overlap considerably ( due to the small nuclear charge ) .",
    "the peak splitting ( or broadening , due to unresolved splitting ) expected in this approach between the two @xmath51 levels would be given by @xmath108 .",
    "assuming the b@xmath3-values of the @xmath98-factors are valid here , this would amount to 3.6  mev for @xmath109  t. this is much larger than the observed 0.3  mev increase of the fwhm of the measured resonance peak .",
    "moreover , the 1  mev shift observed in the experiment is much larger than the expected overall peak shift in this approach .",
    "therefore , the description of the b@xmath0 ground state in the central field approximation is not consistent with the experimental observations .    in summary , magnetic field dependent measurements",
    "indicate that the b@xmath0 ground state is a non - degenerate @xmath1 state",
    ". it would be interesting to have higher resolution spectroscopy data available , in order to exclude that the observed peak broadening is due to unresolved splitting .",
