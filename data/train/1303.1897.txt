    ", fano @xcite showed that two resonant modes decaying via a common reservoir may yield a quantum destructive interference between the modes mediated by the reservoir .",

    ", a transparency window appears in probe - field absorption spectrum , which can be generally decomposed into two lorentzian terms , together with one ( or several ) fano interference term(s ) .",
    "thus eit line shape displays characters of both ats and fano interference .    in the past two decades ,",

    "even simplest molecules are open systems in which each excited molecular rovibrational level is radiatively coupled to many other energy levels .",
    "furthermore , all related experiments were made by using thermal molecular vapors , which involve doppler broadening and other decoherence effects .",
    "therefore , eit in molecular systems is more challenging not only for experimental observation , but also for theoretical analysis .",
    "because of the difficulty for analytical approach , numerical simulations are usually taken . however , the result of numerical simulations is generally not easy to clarify various eit characters , and also hard to distinguish ats from eit clearly .    in the present work ,",
    "we develop an analytical approach on eit and ats in an open v - type molecular system . by detailed analytical calculations on the absorption spectrum of probe field using residue theorem and spectrum - decomposition method",
    ", we find that eit is possible and there exists a crossover from eit to ats ( i.e. eit - ats crossover ) for hot molecules with doppler broadening .",

    "different from the above two incoherent effects which may occur in two - level systems , the eit is a quantum interference phenomenon occurring in multi ( at least three ) level systems . from the above discussions we see that in the weak control - field region both the saturation and hole burning play no significant role .",
    "thus the main reason of the reduction of probe - field absorption in the weak control - field region is due to another mechanism . as shown clearly in the panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ l_d_co ] , where the absorption spectrum of the probe - field consists of a positive ( i.e. the red dashed line ) and a negative ( i.e. the green dashed - dotted line ) part , the reduction at the center of probe - field absorption spectrum is caused by destructive interference , a typical character of eit .",

    "@xcite , where eit happens in the weak control - field region in the same way ( i.e. im(@xmath99 ) consists of two lorentzians ; one of them is positive and the other one is negative ) .",
