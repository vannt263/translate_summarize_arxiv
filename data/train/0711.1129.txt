    "the shape of the photoemission constant - energy maps is determined by the trigonal warping effect in graphene . in monolayers and bilayers , the iso - energetic line changes from an almost - circular to a triangularly - warped shape as the energy increases : the extent of such warping is controlled by the dimensionless parameter @xmath251 , where @xmath252 is the magnitude of the wave vector measured from the center of the valley and @xmath87 is the lattice constant . in bilayer graphene , strong trigonal warping may also occur at low energy because of @xmath126-@xmath127 interlayer coupling , parameterized by @xmath143 @xcite , and the observation of this latter trigonal warping provides an experimental method to determine the magnitude and sign of parameter @xmath143 .",
