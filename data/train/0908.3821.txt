    "sketch of the experimental setup .",
    "the curved arrows represent the average large - scale motion of the fluid.,width=8 ]    our turbulent flow resembles the von krmn geometry , which is widely used in experiments on turbulence and magnetohydrodynamics ( @xcite for example ) .",
    "8 liters of liquid gallium are contained in a closed vertical cylinder of diameter 20  cm and height 24  cm .",
    "the thickness of the cylindrical wall is 7.5  mm , and that of the top and bottom walls is 12  mm ( fig .",
    "[ setup ] ) .",
    "this tank is made of stainless steel .",
    "gallium melts at about 30@xmath8 .",
    "its density is @xmath9  kg / m@xmath10 and its kinematic viscosity is @xmath11  m@xmath12/s .",
    "its electrical conductivity at our operating temperature ( @xmath13c ) is @xmath14  @xmath15m@xmath16 .",
    "the main difference with the usual von krmn setup is the use of two propellers to drive the flow , rather than impellers or disks .",
    "the two propellers are coaxial with the cylinder .",
    "they are made of 4 blades inclined 45 degrees to the axis .",
    "the two propellers are counter - rotating and the blades are such that both propellers are pumping the fluid from the center of the tank towards its end faces .",
    "the large scale flow is similar to the traditional counter - rotating geometry of the von krmn setup .",
    "the propellers are 7 cm in diameter and their rotation rate @xmath17 ranges from @xmath18  hz to @xmath19  hz .",
    "they are entrained at a constant frequency by dc motors , which drives a large scale flow consisting in two parts : first the fluid is pumped from the center of the vessel on the axis of the cylinder by the propellers .",
    "it loops back on the periphery of the vessel and comes back to the center in the vicinity of the equatorial plane .",
    "in addition to this poloidal recirculation , the fluid is entrained in rotation by the propellers .",
    "differential rotation of the fluid is generated by the counter rotation of the propellers , which induces a strong shear layer in the equatorial plane where the various probes are positioned .",
    "the shear layer generates a very high level of turbulence @xcite : the velocity fluctuations are typically of the same order of magnitude as the large scale circulation .",
    "a stationary magnetic field @xmath20 is imposed by a solenoid .",
    "the solenoid is coaxial with the propellers and the cylinder .",
    "@xmath20 is mainly along the axis of the cylinder with small perpendicular components due to the finite size of the solenoid ( its length is 32  cm and its inner diameter is 27  cm ) .",
    "the maximum magnetic field imposed at the center of the tank is 1600  g.      the fluid is incompressible and its dynamics is governed by the navier - stokes equations : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the flow velocity , @xmath23 is the pressure , @xmath24 is the magnetic field and @xmath25 is the electrical current density .",
    "the last term in the r.h.s . of ( [ eqns ] ) is the lorentz force .",
    "a velocity scale can be defined using the velocity of the tip of the blades .",
    "the radius of the propeller being @xmath26  cm , the velocity scale is @xmath27 .",
    "a typical length scale is the radius of the cylinder @xmath28  cm .",
    "the kinetic reynolds number is then @xmath29 at the maximum speed reported here it reaches @xmath30 .",
    "the flow is then highly turbulent and remains so even for a rotation rate ten times smaller .    in the approximations of magnetohydrodynamics ,",
    "the temporal evolution of the magnetic field follows the induction equation : @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the magnetic diffusivity , @xmath33 being the magnetic permeability of vacuum ( @xmath34  m@xmath12s@xmath16 for gallium so that @xmath35 ) @xcite .",
    "the first term in the r.h.s describes the advection and the induction processes .",
    "the second term is diffusive and accounts for ohmic dissipation .",
    "a magnetic reynolds number can be defined as the ratio of the former over the latter : @xmath36 it is a measure of the strength of the induction processes compared to the ohmic dissipation @xcite . for @xmath37",
    "the magnetic field obeys a diffusion equation . for @xmath38 ,",
    "it is transported and stretched by the flow .",
    "this can lead to dynamo action , i.e. spontaneous generation of a magnetic field sustained by a transfer of kinetic energy from the flow to magnetic energy . in our study",
    ", @xmath1 is about 3 at the maximum speed reported here ( @xmath39  hz ) : induction processes are present but do not dominate over diffusion .",
    "as @xmath17 goes from 3 to 30  hz , the magnetic reynolds number is of order 1 in all cases .    in our range of magnetic reynolds number ,",
    "the induced magnetic field @xmath40 is weak relative to @xmath20 ( of the order of @xmath41 ) .",
    "the lorentz force is @xmath42 where @xmath25 is the current induced by the motion of the liquid metal ( no exterior current is applied ) . from ohm s law , this induced current is @xmath43 and is thus of order @xmath44 .",
    "one can define an interaction parameter @xmath0 that estimates the strength of the lorentz force relative to the advection term in the navier - stokes equation : @xmath45 because of the @xmath46 factor , this quantity could reach very high values for low speeds , but the flow would not be turbulent anymore . in order to remain in a turbulent regime , the smallest rotation rate reported here is 3  hz . the maximum interaction parameter ( built with the smallest rotation frequency and the strongest applied magnetic field ) is then approximately @xmath47 .",
    "many studies on magnetohydrodynamics use the hartmann number to quantify the amplitude and influence of the magnetic field . this number measures the ratio of the lorentz force over the viscous one .",
    "it is linked to the interaction parameter by the relation @xmath48 which gives the typical value @xmath49 for the present experiment .",
    "the influence of the electrical boundary conditions at the end faces is determined by this number and the conductivity ratio @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the electrical conductivity of the walls and @xmath52 their thickness .",
    "a very detailed numerical study on this issue has been performed in the laminar situation on a flow which geometry is very similar to the present one in @xcite . as far as turbulent flows are concerned , eckert et al .",
    "stress the importance of the product @xmath53 , which measures the fraction of the electrical current that leaks from the hartmann layers into the electrically conducting walls .",
    "with 12  mm thick end faces @xmath54 is about @xmath55 so that @xmath56 : the walls have to be considered as electrically conducting .",
    "these boundary effects are of crucial importance in experiments where the boundary layers control the rate of turbulence of the flow .",
    "however , in the present experimental setup the fluid is forced inertially and we have checked that the magnetic field has only little influence on the mean flow ( see section [ indmag ] below ) .",
    "furthermore , the high value of the hartmann number implies that the dominant balance in the bulk of the flow is not between the lorentz and viscous forces but between the lorentz force and the inertial term of the navier - stokes equation : in the following , it is the interaction parameter and not the hartmann number that leads to a good collapse of the data onto a single curve .",
    "for these reasons the present experimental device allows to study the influence of a strong magnetic field on the forced turbulence generated in the central shear layer , avoiding any boundary effect .",
    "the propellers are driven at constant frequency .",
    "the current provided to the dc motors is directly proportional to the torques they are applying .",
    "it is recorded to access the mechanical power injected in the fluid .",
    "schematics of the potential probes .",
    "these probes are vertical and the electrodes are positioned in the mid - plane of the tank , where the shear layer induces strong turbulence.,width=5 ]    as liquid metals are opaque , the usual velocimetry techniques such as laser doppler velocimetry or particle image velocimetry can not be used .",
    "hot wire anemometry is difficult to implement in liquid metals even if it has been used in the past @xcite .",
    "other velocimetry techniques have been developed specifically for liquid metals . among those are the potential probes .",
    "they rely on the measurement of electric potential differences induced by the motion of the conducting fluid in a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the latter can be applied locally with a small magnet or at larger scale as in our case .",
    "we built such probes with 4 electrodes ( fig .",
    "[ pot ] ) .",
    "the electrodes are made of copper wire , 1  mm in diameter , and insulated by a varnish layer except at their very tip .",
    "the electrodes are distant of @xmath57  mm .",
    "the signal is first amplified by a factor 1000 with a transformer model 1900 from princeton applied research .",
    "it is further amplified by a stanford research low noise preamplifier model sr560 and then recorded by a national instrument daq .",
    "note that because of the transformer the average potential can not be accessed , so that our study focuses on the turbulent fluctuations of the velocity field .",

    "more surprisingly , we notice that at a given rotation frequency the experimental points corresponding to different amplitudes of the magnetic field are indistinguishable .",
    "this observation confirms that no change of the global structure of the flow is induced by the magnetic field . the fact that the injected power is independent of the applied magnetic field seems to be in contradiction with results from numerical simulations where",
    "an ohmic dissipation of the same order of magnitude as the viscous one is observed when a strong magnetic field is applied ( the ohmic dissipation is around three times the viscous dissipation for @xmath120 in burattini et al.@xcite ) .",
    "one could argue that there may be a large ohmic dissipation compensated by a drop in the viscous dissipation : the energy flux in the turbulent cascade would then be dissipated mainly through ohmic effect without changing the overall injected power",
    ". however , a rough estimate of the ohmic dissipation @xmath121 gives values which are rather low : with the maximum value of the induced magnetic field @xmath122 , and assuming that the magnetic field is dissipated mostly at large scale , one gets : @xmath123 where we used the values @xmath124 , and @xmath125 .",

    "the same effect is seen on the induced magnetic field spectra .",
    "we identify several features which highlight the very different behaviors of forced and decaying turbulence when they are subject to a strong magnetic field : decaying turbulence is thought to evolve towards a bidimensional structure .",
    "its velocity spectrum displays a @xmath143 exponent which can be attributed either to this bidimensionalization or to a quasi - steady equilibrium between velocity transfer and ohmic dissipation . in the present experiment ,",
    "no such @xmath143 exponent is observed , and the spectra are much steeper ( exponent @xmath139 to @xmath158 ) for values of @xmath0 higher than @xmath159 .",

    "when @xmath0 increases , the decrease of this parameter by a factor 3 is the signature of the elongation of the flow structures along the applied magnetic field .",
    "however , the flow always remains 3d since @xmath132 is non - zero even for the highest value of the interaction parameter reached in this experiment .",
    "these differences between forced and decaying turbulence come from the 3d forcing imposed by the propellers , which rules out the possibility of a 2d statistically steady state of the flow",
    ". it would be interesting to perform the same kind of experimental study of the anisotropy with other forcing mechanisms , such as current - driven mhd flows or turbulent thermal convection in a liquid metal .",
    "we have studied the evolution of the injected mechanical power as the applied magnetic field increases and found almost no influence of the latter : the injected mechanical power remains the same although velocity fluctuations are decreased by an order of magnitude in the central shear layer .",
    "finally , we stress the poor level of correlation between the velocity and induced magnetic fields measured in the vicinity of the same point , and attribute it to the scale separation between the two fields .",
    "the strong damping of turbulent fluctuations by the magnetic field can be invoked as a saturation mechanism for turbulent dynamos : in a dynamo experiment , one observes spontaneous generation of magnetic field when the magnetic reynolds number is above a critical value @xmath161 .",
    "if the turbulent fluctuations are involved in the generating process of the magnetic field ( through @xmath162 or @xmath163 mechanisms for instance ) , there is a critical level of rms turbulent fluctuations @xmath164 above which magnetic field is generated ( @xmath165 for @xmath166 ) . for @xmath167 ,",
    "the initial level of turbulent fluctuations is above @xmath164 , and the magnetic field grows exponentially from a small perturbation : the interaction parameter increases , and the turbulent fluctuations are damped according to figure [ sigvstar ] .",
    "an equilibrium is reached when the damping is such that the rms turbulent fluctuations are reduced to @xmath164 . for small values of @xmath0",
    "we observed that @xmath168 , with @xmath169 .",
    "the saturated value @xmath170 of @xmath0 follows from the equality @xmath171 . as @xmath172 is proportional to @xmath1 , we get @xmath173 , hence the following scaling law for the magnetic field : @xmath174 this is the turbulent scaling law for the saturation of a dynamo , which was originally described by ptrlis et al .",
    "( see @xcite for instance ) .",
    "although the exact geometry of the experimental setup and large scale magnetic fields are different from that of the present experimental study , results from the vks dynamo can be used to test this relationship : using @xmath175  cm , @xmath176  cm , @xmath177  hz , @xmath178  kgm@xmath179 , @xmath180  @xmath181 and @xmath182 , the computed magnetic field amplitude is @xmath183  g for @xmath184 .",

    "<S> vorobev et al.@xcite and burratini et al.@xcite performed dns in a forced regime which are closely related to our experiment . however , the maximum kinetic reynolds number reached in their studies remains orders of magnitude below what can be achieved in the laboratory . </S>",
    "<S> an experimental investigation at very high kinetic reynolds number thus remains necessary to characterize the effect of a strong magnetic field on a fully developped turbulent cascade .    </S>",
    "<S> the flow under study in our experiment resembles the von krmn geometry : counter - rotating propellers force a flow inside a cylindrical tank . </S>",
    "<S> the large scale flow is known to have a strong shear layer in the equatorial plane where one observes the maximum level of turbulence @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we do not observe any bifurcation of the flow as the magnetic field increases nor any drastic change of the large scale recirculation imposed by the constant forcing . </S>",
    "<S> these ingredients strongly differ from the previously reported experiments and allow to study the influence of an applied magnetic field on the turbulent cascade in a given flow geometry . </S>",
    "<S> this issue arises in the framework of turbulent laboratory dynamo studies such as the von krmn sodium ( vks ) experiment @xcite which flow s geometry is similar to ours . in the turbulent dynamo problem , </S>",
    "<S> one issue is to understand the precise mechanism for the saturation of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> once the dynamo magnetic field gets strong enough , it reacts on the flow through the lorentz force . </S>",
    "<S> this usually reduces the ability of the flow to sustain dynamo action . </S>",
    "<S> an equilibrium can be reached , so that the magnetic field saturates . </S>",
    "<S> this backreaction changes the properties of the bulk turbulence . in a situation where an @xmath7 effect takes part in the generation of the dynamo , i.e. </S>",
    "<S> if the turbulent fluctuations have a mean field effect , then the changes in the statistics of turbulence should be involved in the saturation mechanism of the dynamo . </S>"
