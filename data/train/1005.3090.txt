    "@xcite in a single component bose system , upon turning on the lattice .",
    "they too observed that different parts of the cloud were fit better by different temperatures . in order to stay close to equilibrium ,",
    "it is crucial that external parameters be changed slowly compared to the timescale for rearranging the state .",
    "having established the timescale for adiabaticity , we now critically evaluate how adiabatically changing the field gradient can lead to cooling .",
    "this is analogous to the adiabatic demagnetization technique used in solid state physics .",
    "adiabatic cooling is based upon the following idea : for a large initial field gradient , the spin entropy is largely contained in the domain wall , while in the bulk the spins are all either pointing up or down . as we lower the field gradient _ adiabatically _ , the entropy of the system stays constant , and remains concentrated at the domain wall .",
    "this effectively means that the size of the domain wall does not change : the entropy contained in the domain wall is @xmath110 times the number of spins in it .",
    "since the domain wall width is proportional to the ratio of the temperature to the magnetic energy @xmath111 , one concludes that if @xmath6 stays fixed , @xmath0 must go down . hence lowering the field gradient cools the system .",
