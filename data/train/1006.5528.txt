    "coupled map lattices ( cml ) have been introduced in the early 1980 s as space - time discrete models of reaction - diffusion processes and of other spatially extended systems @xcite .",
    "originally designed to ascertain the stability of numerical simulation schemes , cml soon appeared to provide a unique opportunity to extend the theory of dynamical systems to realistic infinite dimensional examples with discrete time . in particular , a large effort has been made to define and prove the existence and uniqueness of the ( infinite - dimensional analogue of ) srb measure for small perturbations of uniformly expanding maps , see @xcite and the expanded list of references therein .",
    "of special interest in dynamical systems with spatial extension is also the definition of dynamical quantifiers such as the entropy @xcite or the escape rate .",
    "the escape rate comes as a natural estimator in presence of holes , _",
    "i.e. _  regions in phase space where the dynamics is not defined or where the orbit is lost .",
    "such types of systems often occur in concrete examples ; billiards , lattice or hard - spheres gases , etc @xcite .",
    "when the generator of the dynamics is expanding , the existence of holes suggests to consider the repeller , _",
    "i.e. _  the invariant set of points for which the orbit never reaches any hole .",
    "a natural problem is then to characterize the exponential rate of escape from a small neighborhood of the repeller .",
    "the goal of this paper is to suggest a suitable definition of the escape rate for infinite lattices of weakly coupled maps with holes .",
    "the theory of ( finite dimensional ) dynamical system contains two distinct approaches to the escape rate , either via the conditionally invariant measure @xcite or by volume estimates @xcite .",
    "none of these approaches has an immediate extension to the infinite dimensional setting .",
    "on one hand , no proof of existence of an absolutely continuous conditionally invariant measure for cml is available in the literature , even in the simplest setting . on the other hand",
    ", the second approach needs to be adapted in order to ensure finiteness of estimated ( lebesgue ) volumes at all times .    for simplicity",
    ", we deal here with cml with convolution couplings and transitive expanding real maps satisfying the pianigiani - yorke conditions @xcite and we consider the perturbative regime where the symbolic dynamics is well under control ( section 2 ) .",
    "we first discuss the existence of conditionally invariant measure and some properties of the related escape rate for spatially periodic approximations ( section 3.1 ) .",
    "a piecewise affine example is analyzed in section 3.2 which shows linear growth of the escape rate with the size of the approximation and also monotonic decay as the coupling intensity increases .",
    "this behavior motivates an alternative approach to escape rate that deals with volume estimates of points remaining in the neighborhood of the repeller ( section 3.3 ) . in this context",
    ", we prove the existence of the escape rate for every spatially periodic approximation of arbitrary systems and its linear growth with the system size .",
    "the corresponding asymptotic slope can be regarded as an escape rate per lattice unit for the infinite system . the proof is given in section 4 and essentially relies on the control of cumulative effects of perturbations within cylinder sets .",
    "a cml on the lattice @xmath2 is a dynamical system generated by a self - map @xmath3 in @xmath4 ( endowed with uniform topology and associated norm @xmath5 ) whose specificity resides in the following expression .",
    "the mapping @xmath3 is given by the composition @xmath6 of the direct product @xmath7 of identical real maps and of a coupling @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "in simplest situations , the coupling is the * convolution operator * associated with an arbitrary non - negative and normalized sequence @xmath9 in @xmath10 , _",
    "i.e. _  we have @xmath11 for every configuration @xmath12 ( see @xcite for properties of convolution operators in @xmath4 ) .",

    "there exists a finite collection @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) of pairwise disjoint bounded and closed intervals with the properties that for each @xmath19    * @xmath20 is of class @xmath21 on @xmath22 and @xmath23 , * there exists @xmath24 such that @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , for every @xmath26 such that @xmath27 , we have @xmath28 . * in addition , we also assume that @xmath20 is * transitive * , _ i.e. _  for every pair @xmath29 there is a @xmath30 such that @xmath31 .",
    "we will denote @xmath32 . in this context , the region @xmath33 plays the role of holes for the dynamical system @xmath34 .",
    "the conditions on @xmath20 imply several properties of the dynamics , see e.g.  @xcite , in particular    * the structural stability with respect to @xmath35 perturbations , * the existence of a repeller @xmath36 on which the dynamics is conjugated to a topological markov chain ( @xmath36 is a cantor set , forward invariant under @xmath20 and defined by @xmath37 ) , * the existence of a conditionally invariant probability measure that is absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure .",
    "the topological markov chain operates in the set @xmath38 of admissible sequences which are constrained by the condition ( ii ) ( _ i.e. _  the sequence @xmath39 is * admissible * iff every pair of consecutive symbols @xmath40 complies with the condition @xmath41 ) . each point in @xmath36 is defined by the intersection @xmath42 for some associated code @xmath43",
    ".    all these properties immediately translate to the uncoupled map lattice @xmath7 ( obtained for @xmath44 , the identity mapping and provided that one only considers periodic lattices when the existence of quasi - invariant measure is concerned ) . in particular , the symbolic dynamics is given by the action of time translations on sequences of symbol configurations in @xmath45 . introducing the notation @xmath46 where @xmath47 is an arbitrary * symbol configuration * in @xmath48 ,",
    "the repeller @xmath49 can be regarded as the set of points defined by @xmath50 for some sequence @xmath51 .",
    "alternatively , we have @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "intuitively , the dynamical properties listed above are expected to extend to weakly coupled map lattices with symbolic dynamics being unaffected . to formally state this result",

    "following @xcite , this suggests to investigate the existence of conditionally invariant measures in periodic cml .",
    "let @xmath69 be a mapping acting on some bounded set @xmath70 .",
    "a probability measure @xmath71 on @xmath70 is said to be * conditionally invariant * ( or quasi - invariant ) if there exists a constant @xmath72 such that @xmath73 on @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "when this measure exists the quantity @xmath74 is called the * escape rate*. as mentioned before , the conditions ( i)(iii ) guarantee the existence for @xmath20 of a unique absolutely continuous conditionally invariant measure @xcite .    when @xmath56 , analogous conditions hold for the restriction of the cml to @xmath75 ( @xmath66 arbitrary ) with the collection @xmath76 ( see appendix [ a - erratum ] ) .",
    "it results that , in the weak coupling regime , a unique absolutely continuous conditionally invariant measure exists for the cml on periodic lattices .",
    "an explicit example is provided below .    furthermore , the same conditions ( i)(iii ) for @xmath77 imply the existence of an invariant measure @xmath78 supported on the limit cantor set that is a gibbs state for the potential @xmath79 @xcite . accordingly",
    ", the following expression for the escape rate applies @xcite @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the sum of ( positive ) lyapunov exponents and @xmath82 is the kolmogorov - sinai entropy associated with @xmath78 .",
    "thus , in principle , one could have access to the escape rate of periodic lattices of weakly coupled maps based on the knowledge of their lyapunov exponents and metric entropy ( or _ vice - versa _ as in the example below )",
    ". however , these quantities are not easily accessible in practice , and their behaviour with the spatial period is mostly unknown . moreover",

    "computing the determinant of the derivative @xmath106 yields the following expression for the corresponding escape rate @xmath107 where @xmath108 . in particular , since the lyapunov exponents are in this case trivially given by @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) this expression shows that the kolmogorov - sinai entropy of the measure supported on the cantor set is given by @xmath111 , _",
    "i.e. _  it corresponds to the topological entropy .",
    "the expression ( [ tauxfuite ] ) suggests the following additional comments .    * as a sum of monotonically decreasing functions of @xmath112 , the escape rate @xmath113 decreases when @xmath112 increases . in other words",

    "the rate @xmath113 is an extensive quantity that linearly diverges with the period of configurations .    as for the definition of the entropy in spatially",

    ". thus an * escape rate per lattice unit * can be defined in the limit of large periods @xmath118 this normalized rate also decreases monotonically when @xmath112 increases .",
    "it is interesting to note that all the arguments above extend to cml with any convolution coupling .",
    "the expression for the escape rate per lattice unit remains unchanged @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the ( discrete ) fourier transform of the sequence @xmath63 .",
    "the explicit computations here crucially depend on the assumption that the derivative @xmath106 is constant in phase space . in order to prove the existence of the escape rate per lattice unit for a broader class of cml",
    ", we use a more direct approach that relies on estimating the volume of the sets of points that remain located in the neighborhood of the repeller .",
    "a direct definition of the escape rate can be formulated as follows @xcite .",
    "given a mapping @xmath69 ( @xmath70 bounded ) with an invariant set @xmath121 , the * escape rate * from an @xmath122-neighborhood @xmath123 of @xmath121 ( @xmath124 ) is the limit ( if it exists ) @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the lebesgue volume of the set @xmath127 of points @xmath128 such that @xmath129 for all @xmath130 . in general , the limit does not depend on @xmath123 provided that @xmath122 is small enough . moreover the escape rate of axiom a attractors of diffeomorphisms on compact manifolds satisfies the following variational principle @xcite @xmath131 eckmann and ruelle @xcite conjectured that this relation should be valid in a more general setting .",
