    "recent studies on lattice show that yang - mills theories develop a mass gap in the low energy limit .",
    "this is seen both in the spectrum @xcite and for the gluon propagator @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "several proposals have been put forward @xcite but none of them reached the status of a rigorous proof . notwithstanding",
    "this difficulty , this fundamental result can be used to understand quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in the infrared limit .",
    "a very good approximation for the gluon propagator in the landau gauge at lower energies is a free massive propagator as can be deduced from aforementioned references .",
    "existence of a mass gap and an analytical equation for the gluon propagator in a given gauge opens up the possibility to perform computations at low energies in qcd both at zero and finite temperature .",
    "we were able to prove in this way that a nonlocal nambu - jona - lasinio ( nnjl ) model describes the low energy phenomenology of hadron physics @xcite .",
    "in ref.@xcite we obtained the critical temperature at zero chemical potential for the chiral transition .",
    "this turns out in close agreement with lattice data @xcite and with preceding theoretical computations @xcite .",
    "nnjl model was extensively studied in ref.@xcite that we will follow in this paper .    in this paper",
    "we aim to analyze a problem arisen when unbalanced chiral quark matter is present in a quark condensate .",
    "the question is how critical temperature changes due to the presence of chiral matter .",
    "this question was faced in @xcite to identify the critical end point of qcd .",
    "the idea is , at the thermodynamic equilibrium , to couple the chiral chemical potential , @xmath0 , to a chiral density quark operator , as also happens for the quark number density @xmath1 to the conjugated quark chemical potential @xmath2 @xcite and references therein .",
    "quantum anomaly and chirality changing processes makes @xmath0 coupled to a not strictly conserved quantity .",
    "so , observation is assumed to take longer times than any chirality changing process .",
    "recent theoretical studies support the idea that the critical temperature should decrease with chiral chemical potential @xcite .",
    "recent lattice data have shown that critical temperature increases with @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this behavior of @xmath3 was predicted for the first time by universality arguments in  @xcite and it has also been found later by solving schwinger - dyson equations at finite @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "ruggieri and peng @xcite draw this conclusion with a quark - meson model .",
    "we will strongly support their conclusions .    with our approach",
    ", we will show that a nnjl model provides a critical temperature increasing with the chiral chemical potential .",
    "we will show that , with the results provided in literature for the gluon propagator , the mass gap equation obtain always a solution both with @xmath4 and @xmath5 and , in the latter case , it will depend on the square of it increasing the temperature .",
    "the mass gap seems to play a role , mostly as a lower threshold .",
    "the paper is so structured . in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] we discuss the infrared limit for qcd obtaining the model we solve in the low - energy limit . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we derive the critical temperature . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] conclusions are given .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we yields here a rederivation of the nonlocal nambu - jona - lasinio model we derived in our preceeding works .",
    "details can be found in @xcite .    in order to present our arguments",
    ", we consider the simplest nonlinear theory : a scalar field with equation @xmath6 this equation has exact solutions @xcite @xmath7 being sn an elliptic jacobi function and @xmath2 and @xmath8 two integration constants .",
    "this solutions hold provided the dispersion relation @xmath9 applies .",
    "this is a free massive solution notwithstanding we started from a massless theory .",
    "mass arises from the nonlinearities provided @xmath10 stays finite rather than going to zero .",
    "indeed , standard perturbation theory just fails to recover it .",
    "we have to solve the equation ( [ eq : cphi ] ) in the limit @xmath11 . for our aims",
    "we consider an approach devised in the 80s @xcite : we assume @xmath12 as a functional of @xmath13 and take a power expansion of it .",
    "we put @xmath14=\\phi_0(x)+\\int d^4x'\\left.\\frac{\\delta \\phi[j]}{\\delta j(x')}\\right|_{j=0}j(x ' )     + \\int d^4x'd^4x''\\left.\\frac{\\delta^2 \\phi[j]}{\\delta j(x')\\delta j(x'')}\\right|_{j=0}j(x')j(x'')+\\ldots\\ ] ] being @xmath15}{\\delta j(x')}\\right|_{j=0}=\\delta(x - x')$ ] a solution to the nonlinear equation @xmath16 ^ 2\\delta(x)=\\delta^4(x)$ ] .",
    "a full theory can be devised with this approach and an exactg propagator can be obtained @xcite .",
    "this analysis shows that the theory is trivial .",
    "the propagator is given by @xcite @xmath17 being @xmath18 and @xmath19 and @xmath20 an elliptic integral .",
    "this holds provided one fixes the phase @xmath8 in the exact solution to @xmath21 to preserve translation invariance in the propagating degrees of freedom .",
    "this identifies an infinite set of scalar field theories with a trivial infrared fixed point in quantum field theory .",
    "this can be immediately applied to yang - mills theories as we have exact solutions also in this case @xcite .",
    "indeed , we start from the equations of motion @xmath22 assuming again a current expansion .",
    "if we fix the gauge to a lorenz gauge that is equivalent ot the landau gauge in quantum field theory , we note that the homogeneous equations can be solved by setting @xmath23 being @xmath24 a set of constants .",
    "then , the homogeneous equations collapse to @xmath25 and we have turned back to the previous scalar field theory ( this is no more true for other gauges where the correspondence is just an asymptotic one @xcite and the exact solutions have not all identical components @xcite ) . in this way",
    ", the gluon propagator in the landau gauge is straightforwardly obtained from eq.([eq : green ] ) setting @xmath26 and with a factor @xmath27 .",
    "these solutions confirm that also yang - mills theories seem to share a trivial infrared fixed point .",
    "this is supported by lattice studies of the running coupling @xcite from lattice at @xmath28 and @xmath29 with @xmath30 where the running coupling is seen to go to zero as momenta lower .",
    "a similar result was obtained in@xcite .",
    "this latter computation shows a perfect consistency with an instanton liquid model in agreement with our scenario .",
    "we now consider quantum field theory . generating functional for the scalar field",
    "can be managed by rescaling the space - time coordinates as @xmath31 taking a strong coupling expansion @xmath32 . at the leading order",
    "we need to solve the equation @xmath33 .",
    "expanding in powers of the current , leading order is just a gaussian generating functional with the propagator given by eq.([eq : green ] ) .",
    "next - to - leading order can be also computed @xcite . turning the attention to yang - mills generating functional",
    "we realize that it also takes the simple gaussian form @xmath34=n\\exp\\left[\\frac{i}{2}\\int d^4x'd^4x''j^{a\\mu}(x')d_{\\mu\\nu}^{ab}(x'-x'')j^{b\\nu}(x'')\\right].\\ ] ] using the current expansion @xmath35 and the propagator in the landau gauge @xmath36 being @xmath37 given by eq.([eq : green ] ) .",
    "this propagator represents a sum of propagators of a free theory and a mass spectrum of glue excitations identical to that of a harmonic oscillator .",
    "ghost field just decouples in this limit yielding a free massless propagator .",
    "all these properties of the quantum yang - mills field correspond to the so - called `` decoupling solution '' @xcite ( see also @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "this kind of propagator is the one recovered in lattice computations @xcite .",
    "we yield a comparison in fig.[fig : cuccmend ]     points.[fig : cuccmend ] ]    the agreement is exceedingly good as expected .",
    "this results permits to derive the low - energy limit of qcd and this coincides with a nonlocal nambu - jona - lasinio model @xcite @xmath38+s_q\\ ] ] where the @xmath39 field arises from the gluon propagator in the gaussian generating functional of the yang - mills action , neglecting higher order excited state in the superimposed harmonic oscillator spectrum being exponential damped .",
    "this is the contribution arising from the mass gap of the theory , being @xmath40 .",
    "we are assuming @xmath41 as the string tension ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "quark fields yield @xmath43q(x ) \\\\         & -&g^2\\int d^4x'\\delta(x - x')\\sum_q\\sum_{q'}\\bar q(x)\\frac{\\lambda^a}{2}\\gamma^\\mu\\bar q'(x')\\frac{\\lambda^a}{2}\\gamma_\\mu q'(x')q(x )        + o\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}g}\\right)+o\\left(j^3\\right ) .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , our nonlocal nambu - jona - lasinio model coincides with that presented in @xcite , directly from qcd , provided the form factor is @xmath44 being @xmath45 obtained from eq.([eq : green ] ) , @xmath46 and @xmath47 the standard nambu - jona - lasinio coupling , fixing in this way the value of @xmath48 through the gluon propagator . in fig.[fig : ff ] , we compare this form factor both with the one from an instanton liquid @xcite that is @xmath49\\right\\}^2\\qquad\\text{with } \\xi=\\frac{|p| d}{2}\\ ] ] being @xmath50 and @xmath51 bessel functions . in the following",
    "we normalize this function to be 1 at zero momenta dividing it by @xmath52 .     and",
    "@xmath53.[fig : ff ] ]    the result is strikingly good for the latter showing how consistently our technique represents yang - mills theory through instantons . in the low - energy limit recovers a nonlocal nambu - jona - lasinio model and maintains the defects of this approximation as a non - confinig behavior .",
    "higher order corrections can grant to recover this property of the theory . with our approach",
    "these can be computed .",
    "so , finally we write down the njl action we will use in the following as was obtained from qcd @xmath54q(x ) \\nonumber \\\\         & + & \\int d^4x\\int d^4x'{\\cal g}(x - x')\\sum_q\\sum_{q'}\\bar q(x)\\frac{\\lambda^a}{2}\\gamma^\\mu\\bar q'(x ' )          \\frac{\\lambda^a}{2}\\gamma_\\mu q'(x')q(x).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this can be bosonized in a standard way @xcite giving the effective field theory .",
    "one introduces the field @xmath55 and @xmath56 and this will yield , after a fierz rearrangement and considering a two flavor qcd , @xmath57 being @xmath58 su(2 ) pauli matrices and neglecting quark masses .",
    "this appears as a well - known quark - meson model and so , we can add the chemical chiral potential as in @xcite @xmath59 finally , we will perform all the computations at finite temperature .",
    "the potential has the form @xcite",
    "@xmath60 \\nonumber \\\\      & + & \\int d^4x\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(g^{-1}+m_0 ^ 2)\\sigma^2+\\frac{1}{2g}{\\bm\\pi}\\cdot{\\bm\\pi}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that yields the gap equation @xcite @xmath61 being @xmath62 the vacuum expecation value of the @xmath39 field .",
    "we introduce a sum on the matsubara frequencies @xmath63 and the gap equation becomes @xmath64 here @xmath65 is given by @xmath66 using eq.([eq : gp ] ) but moving to euclidean .",
    "the restoration of chiral symmetry is given at @xmath67 and so , we have to solve @xmath68 to obtain the critical temperature as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "we consider just one term in the form factor ( [ eq : gp ] ) .",
    "this is so because we want to be consistent with the njl action just obtained , noting that higher excitations are exponentially damped .",
    "then , we will have @xmath69 having moved to euclidean and being @xmath40 the mass gap .",
    "we take @xmath70 and then @xmath71 matsubara sum can be performed analytically giving @xmath72 in order to get an understanding , we try to solve the gap equation with @xmath4 and then , we restate it into the equation",
    ". we will have @xmath73 that yields for @xmath74 , after integration on momenta , @xmath75 being @xmath76 a needed cut - off to regularize divergent integrals .",
    "this cut - off must be chosen so that the product @xmath77 is kept constant while @xmath76 runs to infinity .",
    "then , @xmath78 we see that , in this case , the gap equation admits always a solution whatever is the coupling @xmath79 and chiral symmetry is broken",
    ". as expected , temperature runs to infinity as the cut - off itself .",
    "when @xmath0 is turned on , one has , taken limit @xmath74 , @xmath80 and , after integration on momenta , we get @xmath81 this yields @xmath82 this is the main result of the paper showing that the critical temperature increases with the chiral chemical potential in agreement with ruggieri and peng  @xcite , with lattice results   @xcite and solution of dyson - schwinger equations  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note the dependence on the mass gap @xmath83 .",
    "this equation seems to imply that @xmath84 .",
    "using recent studies on lattice , we were able to derive the low - energy limit of qcd .",
    "the result is given by a nonlocal njl model that is amenable to analytical computations . in this way",
    ", we are able to conclude that the critical temperature for chiral symmetry breaking in qcd increases as the square of the chiral chemical potential in agreement with recent lattice studies .",
    "this result supports the conclusions presented in a recent work @xcite supporting a preferential choice of a renormalization scheme .",
