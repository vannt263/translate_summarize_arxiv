    "the study of galaxy formation and evolution relies on imaging and spectroscopy of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "the relevant data are typically limited by the surface brightness of these galaxies , and their spatial size only allows a measurement of the galaxy as a whole , limiting our ability to understand where in the galaxy processes like star formation occur . to reach sufficient levels of signal - to - noise , studies often stack spectra of many galaxies , thus averaging over a population ( e.g. , shapley 2003 , reddy et al .",
    "the only means to study individual high-@xmath0 galaxies in detail , at least until the era of jwst and 30m - class telescopes , is to analyze lensed galaxies whose brightnesses are magnified , and spatial sizes are stretched by the gravitational potential of the lens , making them suitable for spatially - resolved spectroscopy .",

    "et al . ( 2011 ; hereafter r11 ) , we analyze a keck / nirspec spectrum of the brightest part of the arc to determine the physical conditions in this galaxy .",
    "the interpretation of our findings in both papers relied on a preliminary lens model based on ground - based imaging , which did not allow unique identification of arc substructure at the level required for a robust lens model ; this limited our ability to fully understand the lensed , highly distorted arc in terms of its source morphology .",
    "it also compromises the precision and accuracy with which we can determine the average magnification of the galaxy , a property crucial for calculating intrinsic properties such as the star formation rate . in this paper , we use hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) imaging with wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) to uniquely identify features in the lensed galaxy . with the dramatic improvement in spatial resolution ( less then @xmath3 fwhm in the uvis channel ) relative to the ground - based data ( @xmath4 seeing at best ,",

    "the data were acquired using six broad - band filters and one narrow - band filter : f390w ( total exposure time 1401 s ) , f606w ( 1003 s ) , and f814w ( 2133 s ) in the uvis channel , and f098 m ( 1212 s ) , f125w ( 862 s ) , f132n ( 2212 s ) , and f160w ( 862 s ) in the ir channel .",

    "although perturbation from cluster galaxies is an essential component in the model , the proximity of the observed arcs to cluster galaxies is not small enough to constrain their model parameters , meaning that a large region in the galaxy parameter space is allowed by the constraints .",
    "we therefore report the best - fit value , and the range that was set as prior instead of a formal uncertainty .    the best - fit model is found in an iterative manner .",
    "we start with an optimization in the source plane , allowing all the parameters to vary as described above",

    "for now , we choose to not include substructure whose existence is not directly motivated by an observed counterpart .",
    "the source plane reconstruction is done by ray - tracing the pixels in the observed frame through the lensing potential of the best - fit lens model ( see figures  [ fig.2 ] and [ fig.sourceplane ] ) . in the process we preserve the spatial information by allowing de - lensed pixels to have arbitrary shapes and sizes .",
    "the source reconstruction is used as a tool to understand the mapping between the distorted images of the multiply - lensed source and the source itself .",
    "the location of the source galaxy with respect to the source - plane caustics determines the geometry , multiplicity and parity of each of its lensed images . as in many cases of giant arcs ,",
    "the source galaxy is positioned such that a caustic crosses it , resulting in a high magnification . in the case of rcsga 032727 - 132609 , as can be seen in figure  [ fig.2 ] , the caustic that corresponds to the ne tangential critical curve separates the source into two general parts . the part that lies inside the caustic is multiply - imaged five times : its instances are images 1 , 2 , and part of images 3 , 4 and 5 .",
    "the part of the source that remains outside the caustic is multiply - imaged only three times , in images 3 , 4 and 5 , and `` vanishes '' in the merging pair images 1 and 2 .",
    "the bright region that extends to both sides of the critical curve between images 1 and 2 is in fact mapped to an extremely small area in the source , directly inwards to the caustic .",
    "this source - plane to image - plane mapping may be best understood from figure  [ fig.sourceplane ] , which shows four separate reconstructions of the source , each one from a different lensed image . in figure",
    "[ fig.source_labeled ] ( and the inset in figure  [ fig.1 ] ) , we merge these four reconstructions , by combining the best - resolved segments of the source into one frame .",
    "notice that a faint area at the `` left '' edge of the source , which crosses back into the critical curve ( designated by label a in figure  [ fig.source_labeled ] ) , is also highly magnified to form the faint tangential arc labeled as a in figure  [ fig.2 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig.magnific2 ] shows image - plane magnification contours for a source at @xmath74 , derived from the best - fit model . due to the extended nature of the source , and its location in proximity to the source - plane caustics ,",
    "the magnification is highly nonuniform along the giant arc , ranging from @xmath75 far from the critical curves to hundreds at the critical curve .",
    "we note that the effect of spatially varying magnification must be considered when interpreting measurements of the physical properties of strongly lensed galaxies , and can produce erroneous estimates of star formation rate if not accounted for ( see   [ s.spec ] ) .",
    "for example , blain ( 1999 ) demonstrated that differential magnification of strongly lensed sub - mm galaxies can confuse measurements of the dust temperatures of those objects .    to avoid nonlinearity and pixelization issues close to the critical curve",
    ", we measure the magnification of the arc by comparing the observed size of the image with the size of the model - reconstructed source .",
    "the magnification is the ratio of areas .",
    "since some parts are highly magnified , it is instructive to measure the magnification separately for segments of the giant arc as well as the total magnification .",
    "we estimate the magnification uncertainty through a simulation , in which we compute many lens models , in each one drawing a set of model parameters from steps in the mcmc that are within [ @xmath76,@xmath77 . this range encompasses the @xmath78 uncertainty in the parameter space .",
    "we then measure the magnification as described above in each model , and report the magnification according to the best - fit model , and the range of magnifications found in the simulation , which is equivalent to a @xmath78 confidence interval .",
    "we find that the total magnification of the source , measured as the total area of all of its images devided by the area of the model - generated source , is @xmath79 .",
    "the average magnification across the giant arc is @xmath80 , and the counter image is magnified by @xmath81 .",
    "the fifth image , close to the bcg , is de - magnified , i.e. , it appears smaller on the sky than the source would have appeared had it not been lensed .",
    "its magnification is @xmath82 . breaking the giant arc into its three separate images , we find magnifications of @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85   for images 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .",
    "note that images 1 and 2 do not represent the entire source galaxy , and therefore the total magnification of the source is not a simple linear summation of the magnifications .",
    "figure  [ fig.longslit ] shows a part of the giant arc that was targeted for longslit spectroscopy in r11 , and the de - lensed location of the slit in the source plane .",
    "we find that the portion of the arc that is covered by the slit is magnified by @xmath86 .",
    "the simulations used to assess the uncertainties allow us to explore the dependence of the magnification on model parameters , and degeneracies and correlations between these parameters .",
    "similar to jullo et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , we find that the strongest correlation between model parameters is between @xmath52 and @xmath51 : higher values of @xmath52 result in higher values of @xmath51 .",
    "the ellipticity is anti - correlated with both @xmath51 and @xmath52 . a similar correlation exists between these parameters and the source magnification .",
    "figure [ fig.correlations ] shows the dependence of the total magnification on some of the model parameters ( other parameters show no significant correlations , and are not shown ) .",
    "the magnification increases linearly with @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and decreases with the cluster ellipticity .",
    "interestingly , we find a correlation with the model - predicted redshift of s7 , meaning that securing the redshift of this arc through spectroscopy will reduce the magnification uncertainty .",
    "in r11 we used 1.3 hr of keck / nirspec spectroscopy to determine physical properties of the source , including extinction , electron temperature , oxygen abundance , and the n / o , ne / o , and ar / o abundance ratios .",
    "most of these properties are independent of the lensing magnification .",
    "the exception is the star formation rate ( sfr ) , which was measured from the flux divided by the average magnification .",
    "this average magnification has now been better measured from our new lens model , warranting a re - examination of the star formation rate measured in r11 .",
    "furthermore , the much higher spatial resolution of our new lensing map compared to that available to r11 enables us to better contextualize their results .",
    "figure  [ fig.longslit ] shows the de - lensed r11 nirspec slit on the source plane . the new lens model and source reconstruction shows that the slit targets a very small portion of the source galaxy , which is highly magnified due to its location close to the caustic .",
    "it is therefore not representative of the galaxy as a whole , but nevertheless provides a unique opportunity to probe 100 pc scale areas in the galaxy .",
    "wuyts et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and r11 measured the star formation rate for rcsga 032727 - 132609   in multiple ways : from the broad - band optical photometry ; from the 24@xmath87 flux ; and from the h@xmath9 flux measured by nirspec . they reported a discrepancy : the sfr derived from the balmer lines is much higher than inferred from broadband photometry or 24@xmath87 flux .",
    "indeed , the h@xmath9 flux measured for rcsga 032727 - 132609   is eight times higher than was measured by teplitz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for ms 1512-cb58 .",
    "our new lensing model solves this problem .",
    "r11 assumed a magnification of 17.2 , which was the average magnification of the entire giant arc reported by wuyts et al .",
    "our new lens model shows that the portion of the galaxy captured by the nirspec slit has a much higher magnification , @xmath86 .",
    "the sfr inferred from h@xmath9 must thus be scaled down , to @xmath88 ( @xmath86 ) @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) @xmath91 ( not corrected for extinction ) .",
    "this new measurement is now consistent with the sfrs inferred from the broadband sed and from the mid - ir .",
    "we use new _ hst_/wfc3 imaging data to construct a robust lens model for the lensing cluster rcs2 032727 - 132623 . using the new lens model",
    ", we map out the magnification of the highly - magnified arc rcsga 032727 - 132609 , and construct a de - lensed image of the source galaxy . due to the location of the galaxy in the source plane with respect to the lensing caustics ,",
    "parts of the source are multiply - imaged five times , while other parts are multiply - imaged only three times in a merging - pair configuration . in particular , we find that the brightest parts of the giant arc , which were targeted for rest - frame optical spectroscopy by r11 , are lensed images of a small region of the source galaxy ( @xmath72 of the spatial size of the galaxy ) .",
    "the resolution of the _ hst _ data allows us to uniquely identify features in the different lensed images of the source , and identify additional lensed galaxies .",
    "the resultant lens model is superior to the previously published lens model ( wuyts et al .",
    "2010 ) based on ground - based data . to quantify this claim , we compare the magnification uncertainty between models , a value that is crucial for understanding the physical conditions in the source galaxy through a measurement of the intrinsic , unlensed , luminosity",
    "( see figure  [ fig.magnific_comp ] ) . since the ground - based lens model was not robust enough to measure the magnification of the giant arc directly , we concentrate on the easier to measure , less sensitive magnification of its counter image . in the top panel ,",
    "we plot a histogram of the magnifications that were derived from a suit of simulated lens models , with parameters drawn from mcmc steps in this work . the same is shown in the bottom panel , for the model published in wuyts et al .",
    "the magnifications in each set are divided by the magnifications from the best - fit models , to enable the comparison .",
    "we find that even in the case of the counter image , the magnification uncertainty improves by a factor of four when using high - resolution _ hst _ data .",
    "we emphasize that the model presented in wuyts et al .",
    "( 2010 ) is based on wrong assumptions about the mapping of the counter images to each other ; in particular , the brightest emission knot marked g in figure  [ fig.1 ] was assumed to have a counter image in images 1 ( aa ) and 2 ( ab ) of the giant arc , whereas we now understand that this is not the case .",
    "thus , the magnification that was derived from it was not accurate , and the uncertainty was probably under - estimated .",
    "we use the new model to estimate the average magnification within the r11 nirspec aperture , @xmath86 . based on this magnification , we find that the average sfr within the aperture is @xmath90 , significantly lower than the value we reported in r11 , a value that was estimated under the assumption that the source is uniform and the sampled region is representative of the entire source .",
    "we remind the reader that this knowingly - wrong assumption was the only possible assumption at the time , with only a preliminary mass model in hand . in r11 ,",
    "the sfr was estimated by multiplying the flux by the luminosity - weighted fraction of the galaxy that is covered by the slit , and dividing by the average magnification of the giant arc .",
    "this procedure results in an effective magnification which is several times too small , and implies an extremely high sfr for the entire source . in practice",
    ", the region sampled by the slit , as illustrated in figure  [ fig.longslit ] , represents only about 10% of the physical size of the source ; it does not cover the brightest part of the source , and is probably not representative of the entire galaxy , as we suspected in r11 .",
    "the higher value of this updated magnification reinforces the usefulness of rcsga 032727 - 132609   for probing down the luminosity function at high redshift , particularly with alma .",
    "the results shown in this paper allow the precise mapping of the knots in the arc to the source plane for the first time .",
    "this work enables many other investigations . in an upcoming paper",
    "we will analyze spectra on a knot - by - knot basis , to study the degree to which physical conditions vary across the arc .",
    "we also intend to use the high - resolution _ hst _ imaging presented in this paper to map on a pixel - by - pixel basis the spectral energy distribution , star formation rate , and extinction of the source , which we defer to a future paper .",
    "further spectroscopy should provide secure redshifts for one or more of the secondary arcs , which will reduce the uncertainty in model parameters and the magnification to the few - percent level , making rcsga 032727 - 132609   one of the best understood lensed high-@xmath0 galaxies .",

    "<S> we present new _ hst_/wfc3 imaging data of rcsga 032727 - 132609 , a bright lensed galaxy at @xmath0=1.7 that is magnified and stretched by the lensing cluster rcs2 032727 - 132623 . using this new high - resolution imaging , </S>",
    "<S> we modify our previous lens model ( which was based on ground - based data ) to fully understand the lensing geometry , and use it to reconstruct the lensed galaxy in the source plane . </S>",
    "<S> this giant arc represents a unique opportunity to peer into 100-pc scale structures in a high - redshift galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> this new source reconstruction will be crucial for a future analysis of the spatially - resolved rest - uv and rest - optical spectra of the brightest parts of the arc . </S>"
