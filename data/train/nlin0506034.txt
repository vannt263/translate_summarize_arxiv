    "note that the complex eigenvalues @xmath313 persist throughout the entire existence domain of the 2nd family , which is @xmath314 at @xmath309 .",

    "this _ exponential instability _ induced by the real eigenvalue @xmath319 has been reported in @xcite .",
    "since it was claimed in @xcite that @xmath56 in the entire existence domain of the 2nd family of vector solitons , we conclude that the instability bifurcation at @xmath320 falls into the scenario of appendix a.1 with @xmath197 . in the interval @xmath321 , the oscillatory instability is overshadowed by the exponential instability from the eigenvalue @xmath319 .",
    "however , in the interval @xmath322 , this oscillatory instability is the only instability experienced by vector solitons .",

    "when @xmath306 decreases further , one pair of these imaginary eigenvalues ( denoted as @xmath332 in fig .",
    "6 ) always remain imaginary , but the other pair of imaginary eigenvalues ( @xmath333 in fig .",

    "similar to the @xmath309 case above , this narrow interval of oscillatory instability was missed in @xcite , but the exponential instability was captured there .    finally , we have mapped out the regions of exponential and oscillatory instabilities in the entire domain of existence for the 2nd family of vector solitons .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "the almost - straight boundary lines show the local and nonlocal bifurcation boundaries @xcite .",
    "the large domain of exponential instability away from the local bifurcation boundary corresponds to the one computed in fig . 2 of @xcite .",

    "we have applied the closure theorem for the negative index of the linearized hamiltonian to multi - hump vector solitons in the general coupled nls equations ( [ nls ] ) .",
    "unstable eigenvalues of the linearized problem ( [ l ] ) are approximated with the perturbation series expansions and found numerically with the shooting method .",
    "not only the numerical results are in excellent agreement with the closure relation ( [ closure ] ) , but also the closure relation ( [ closure ] ) shows that all unstable eigenvalues are recovered with the numerical shooting method . these analytical and numerical results establish that all multi - hump vector solitons in the non - integrable coupled _ cubic _ nls equations are linearly unstable , while multi - hump vector solitons in the coupled _ saturable _ nls equations can be linearly stable in certain regions of the parameter space . in the latter case , we have also discovered a new oscillatory instability which was missed before .",
    "this oscillatory instability significantly reduces the stability domains of vector solitons .",
    "we note that the closure theorem is applied differently in sections 3 and 4 . for coupled cubic nls equations , we compute the closure relation ( [ closure ] ) from the right - hand side @xmath342 at the local bifurcation boundary and then match it with the number of unstable eigenvalues of the linearized problem ( [ l ] ) . for coupled saturable nls equations",
    ", we compute the closure relation ( [ closure ] ) directly from the left - hand side @xmath343 at the local bifurcation boundary and continue it in the entire existence domain .",
    "while the negative index theory is well understood in @xcite and well illustrated in @xcite and this paper , the following problem still remains a challenge : _ how do we understand the stability of vector solitons in sign - indefinite coupled - mode equations , such as the nonlinear dirac equations ? _ the closure theorem is obviously invalid for the dirac equations as the continuous spectrum has both positive and negative energies .",
