    "many potentials have been proposed to describe the meson properties @xcite . despite of this diversity ,",
    "the central part of the interaction used in usual models presents similar characteristics : an attractive short range part with a confining long range interaction .",
    "the prototype for these potentials is the so - called cornell potential  @xcite which can be used to describe a large body of the meson masses except the masses of the pseudoscalar states for which a spin dependent and a flavor mixing interaction is necessary .",

    "@xcite have a phenomenological nature : whereas the general behavior of potentials are often dictated by physical considerations , the values of their parameters are most of the time obtained by trial and error from a comparison with some experimental data .",
    "the values of various observables which can be generated from potential models will be strongly constrained by this general behavior of potentials and by the values of their parameters ; however , despite of the ease with which the numerical values of these observables can be obtained , the exact nature of these constraints is often very difficult to infer from the numerical results .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to show that the use of a bohr - sommerfeld quantization ( bsq ) approach can provide unexpected insight into potential models .",
    "we use this method to obtain some general characteristics of constituent quark models .",
    "in particular , we will show that it is possible to obtain analytical expressions for the spectra , root mean square radii , decay widths , electromagnetic mass splittings or electric polarizabilities , which closely approximate the numerically exact results obtained from full quantum schrdinger or spinless salpeter approaches , and which can thus be used , e.g. , to derive accurate predictions for the dependence of the observables on the quantum numbers .",
    "we will study the constraints imposed by these formulae on the dynamics of the quark - antiquark interaction within a potential model .",
    "the basic quantities in the bsq approach @xcite are the action variables , @xmath0 where @xmath1 labels the degrees of freedom of the system , and where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the coordinates and conjugate momenta ; the integral is performed over one cycle of the motion .",

    "the properties of various observables are representative of those which can be obtained from the usual constituent quark models",
    ". in particular , conclusions about asymptotic behaviors ( large value of quantum numbers ) of these quantities will be quite reliable since most of the potential models use a linear confinement .",
