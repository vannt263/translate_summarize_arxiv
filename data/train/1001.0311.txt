    "to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a hamiltonian operator @xmath33 , we can use a general operational procedure called the factorization method . in this method",

    "these operators are used to obtain the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian .",
    "in contrast to the simple harmonic oscillator , one ladder operator is usually not sufficient to form all the hamiltonian s eigenfunctions and another ladder operator is needed for each eigenfunction .    this method",

    "the form of these operators depends on the form of the potential @xmath36 and the factorization energy .",
