    "the simplest example of a cat(0 ) cube complex @xmath0 is a simplicial tree ; the midpoint of a vertex is the analogue of a _ hyperplane _ for a general cat(0 ) cube complex .",
    "hyperplanes separate @xmath0 into two connected components , called _ halfspaces _ , the collection of which is denoted by @xmath11 .",

    "furthermore , the exclusion of a finite orbit on @xmath33 excludes the existence of a euclidean factor in the essential core ( see corollary  [ no euclidean factors ] ) .",
    "a key object in this paper is the _ roller boundary _ @xmath34 of a cat(0 ) cube complex , defined in   [ subsec:2.1 ] .",
    "it arises naturally from considering the hyperplane ( and hence halfspace ) structure of @xmath0 .",
    "the vertex set of @xmath0 , together with its roller boundary , can be thought of as a closed subset of a bernoulli space ( with @xmath11 as the indexing set ) and is hence compact and totally disconnected .",
    "although in the case of a tree the roller boundary and the visual boundary coincide , we remark that in general , there is no natural map between them . in proposition",
    "[ prop : visual - to - roller ] we prove nevertheless a result relating , to the extent to which it is possible , finite orbits in the roller boundary to finite orbits in the cat(0 ) boundary .",
    "the dichotomy that we obtain is analogous to the one in the case of a group @xmath1 acting on a symmetric space @xmath35 of non - compact type ; in this case , if @xmath1 fixes a point at infinity in the cat(0 ) boundary of @xmath35 , the image of @xmath1 is contained in a parabolic subgroup , via which it acts on the symmetric space of non - compact type associated to the semisimple component of the parabolic .",
    "the latter action may very well be non - elementary .",
    "the dichotomy in proposition  [ prop : visual - to - roller ] leads to the following converse of theorem  [ thm_intro : main ] :    [ thm : converse ] let @xmath0 be a finite dimensional cat(0 ) cube complex with an elementary @xmath1-action .",
    "then :    either there is a finite orbit in the roller compactification @xmath36 of @xmath0 and hence the median class @xmath30 of the @xmath1-action on @xmath0 vanishes for all @xmath26 ;    or there exists a finite index subgroup @xmath37 and a @xmath38-invariant subcomplex @xmath39 ( of lower dimension ) on which the @xmath38-action is non - elementary . in this case",
    "any median class @xmath30 , @xmath26 , of the @xmath1-action on @xmath0 restricts to a median class of the @xmath38-action on @xmath40 and , in particular , it does not vanish .",
    "one of the benefits of the roller boundary is its robustness when considering products . because of this",
    ", the median cocycle can be defined for each irreducible factor of the essential core of @xmath0 .",
    "we refer the reader to proposition  [ prop : decomposition ] for a description of the cocycle in the case in which the cat(0 ) cube complex is not irreducible and hence of the naturality of behavior of the median class with respect to products .",
    "this , together with theorem  [ thm_intro : main ] yields immediately the following :    [ cor : dim ] let @xmath0 be a finite dimensional cat(0 ) cube complex with a non - elementary action @xmath2 .",

    "we show moreover in proposition  [ prop : restriction ] that the median class of @xmath0 behaves naturally also with respect to taking appropriate sub complexes .",
    "recently bestvina ",
    "fujiwara have announced the proof of the non - vanishing of the second bounded cohomology with general uniformly convex banach spaces as coefficients and for weakly properly discontinuous actions on cat(0 ) spaces in the presence of a rank one isometry ( that is an isometry whose axis does not bound a half flat ) .",
    "however , in theorem  [ thm_intro : main ] , we are neither assuming that the action of @xmath2 is proper or weakly properly discontinuous , nor that the cat(0 ) cube complex is proper or has a cocompact group of automorphisms .",
    "moreover in the cat(0 ) cube complex is a product , then there are no rank one isometries .",
    "sageev proved @xcite that there is always a decomposition of a cat(0 ) cube complex analogous to the decomposition of symmetric spaces into  irreducible \" ( or  rank one \" ) factors .",
    "our result is not sensitive to this decomposition and hence also applies to products .",
    "we want to emphasize that the existence of a well behaved and concrete bounded cohomological class goes well beyond the mere knowledge that the bounded cohomology group does not vanishes and is the starting point of a wealth of rigidity results ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore our coefficients reflect geometric properties of the cat(0 ) cube complex , and this is essential to draw conclusions about the action .",
    "an example of this is the following superrigidity result :    [ thm : appl_intro ]",
    "let @xmath44 be an irreducible finite dimensional cat(0 ) cube complex and @xmath45 an irreducible lattice in the product of @xmath46 locally compact groups .",
    "let @xmath47 be an essential and non - elementary action on @xmath44 .",
    "then the action of @xmath1 on @xmath44 extends continuously to an action of @xmath6 , by factoring via one of the factors .    here",
    "the group @xmath48 is a topological group endowed with the topology of the pointwise convergence on vertices .",
    "this theorem is proven in ",
    "[ sec : appl ] , to which we refer the reader also for an analogous result that does not require @xmath44 to be irreducible and the action to be essential .",
    "we remark that requiring that the action is essential is necessary if one wants an irreducible cat(0 ) cube complex , as there is no guarantee that the essential core will be irreducible even when @xmath0 is . a result similar to theorem  [ thm : appl_intro ]",
    "was proven by monod ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorems  6 and 7 ) in the case of an infinite dimensional cat(0 ) space , with conditions both on the action and on the lattice @xmath1 .",
    "for example , if @xmath1 is not uniform , then in order to apply monod s version of theorem  [ thm : appl_intro ] , @xmath1 has to be square - integrable and weakly cocompact . although these conditions are verified for a large class of groups ( such as for example kazhdan kac ",
    "moody lattices and lattices in connected semisimple lie groups ) , they are in general rather intractable . to give a sense of this ,",
    "let us only remark that already finite generation ( needed for example for square integrability ) is not known for a lattice @xmath49 , not even by imposing strong conditions on the closure of the projections on @xmath1 in @xmath50 to insure irreducibility .",
    "furthermore the more specific nature of a cat(0 ) cube complex versus a cat(0 ) space allows us to extend the action to the whole complex .    as an illustration we have the following corollary :    [ cor : finiteorbit ] let @xmath1 be an irreducible lattice in the product @xmath51 of @xmath46 locally compact groups with a finite number of connected components .",
    "then any @xmath1-action on a finite dimensional cat(0 ) cube complex is elementary , and has a finite orbit in the roller compactification @xmath52 .    indeed , since @xmath6 has finitely many connected components and for any cat(0 ) cube complex @xmath0 the group @xmath21 is totally disconnected , a continuous map from @xmath6 to @xmath21 must have finite image . in view of theorem",
    "[ thm : appl_intro ] , this implies that every @xmath1-action on a finite - dimensional cat(0 ) cube complex is elementary .",
    "notice that every finite index subgroup @xmath53 is itself a lattice in @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , the closure of the projection of @xmath38 to each factor @xmath54 is a closed subgroup of finite index in @xmath54 .",
    "it is thus open , and therefore contains the connected component of the identity of @xmath54 .",
    "this shows that @xmath38 is itself an irreducible lattice in the product of @xmath46 locally compact groups with a finite number of connected components . by theorem  [ thm :",
    "converse ] , this implies that every @xmath38-action , and thus also every @xmath1-action , has a finite orbit in the roller compactification of @xmath0 .",
    "combining corollary  [ cor : finiteorbit ] with a description of the structure of a point stabiliser in the roller boundary , established by pierre - emmanuel caprace in appendix  [ sec : appb ] , one obtains the following fixed point property for lattices in semisimple groups , which was pointed out to us by him .",
    "[ cor : lie ] let @xmath1 be an irreducible lattice in a semisimple lie group of rank at least  @xmath55 . then every @xmath1-action on a finite - dimensional cat(0 ) cube complex @xmath0 has a fixed point .",

    "otherwise , we apply corollary  [ cor : rigidity ] from appendix  [ sec : appb ] below : condition ( a ) holds as a consequence of margulis normal subgroup theorem , while condition ( b ) holds by corollary  [ cor : finiteorbit ] .",
    "it is conjectured that the conclusion of corollary  [ cor : lie ] holds without the hypothesis that @xmath0 is finite - dimensional , see @xcite .",
    "in fact , yves de cornulier shows in @xcite that this is indeed the case provided the ambient semisimple lie group has at least one simple factor of rank at least  @xmath55 .    on a different tone ,",
    "recall that the concept of measure equivalence was introduced by gromov as a measure theoretical counterpart of quasi - isometries .",
    "the vanishing or non - vanishing of bounded cohomology is not invariant under quasi - isometries ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 1.7 ) ) ; on the other hand , monod  shalom proved that vanishing of bounded cohomology with coefficients in the regular representation is invariant under measure equivalence @xcite and hence introduced a class of groups @xmath56 .",
    "they also proved for example that if @xmath57 and @xmath58 is measure equivalent to @xmath59 , then @xmath58 and @xmath59 are commensurable .",
    "we can add to the groups in this list :    [ cor : creg_intro ] let @xmath1 be a group acting on a finite dimensional irreducible cat(0 ) cube complex . if the action is metrically proper , non - elementary and essential , then @xmath60 , for @xmath20 , and hence in particular @xmath57 .",
    "we remark that the same result does not hold if @xmath0 is not irreducible ( and hence the action is not essential ) .",
    "in fact , it can be easily seen using ( * ? ? ? * theorem  16 ) , that if @xmath61 is an irreducible lattice in the product of locally compact groups , then @xmath62 , provided @xmath63 and @xmath64 are not compact .",
    "an example of such a group is any irreducible lattice @xmath1 in @xmath65 , while it is easy to see that it acts non - elementarily and essentially on the product of two regular trees @xmath66 .    a result similar to corollary  [ cor : creg_intro ] has been proven by hamenstdt in the case of a group @xmath1 acting properly on a proper cat(0 ) space , also under the assumption that there exists a rank one isometry and that the group @xmath1 is closed in the isometry group of @xmath0 , @xcite .",
    "similarly , hull and osin proved that every group @xmath1 with a sufficiently nice hyperbolic subgroup has infinite dimensional @xmath67 , for @xmath20 , @xcite .",

    "fujiwara `` weakly properly discontinuous '' condition .",
    "we emphasize that our cat(0 ) cube complex are allowed to be locally countable and that , again , irreducibility is equivalent to the existence of a rank one isometry , @xcite .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm_intro : main ] uses the functorial approach to bounded cohomology developed in @xcite ; the main point here is to be able to realize bounded cohomology via essentially bounded alternating cocycles on a _",
    "strong @xmath1-boundary_. recall from @xcite that a strong @xmath1-boundary is a lebesgue space @xmath68 endowed with a measure class preserving @xmath1-action that is in addition amenable and doubly ergodic `` with coefficients '' ( see @xcite for the precise definition or ",

    "an example of a strong @xmath1-boundary is the poisson boundary of any spread out non - degenerate symmetric probability measure on @xmath1 , @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the approach using a strong @xmath1-boundary is that the second bounded cohomology is not a quotient anymore ( hence allowing to determine easily when a cocycle defines a non - trivial class ) ; the disadvantage is that the pull - back via a representation has to be realized by a boundary map ( with consequent technical difficulties , @xcite ) .",
    "the amenability of a strong @xmath1-boundary implies immediately the existence of a boundary map into probability measures on the roller compactification of @xmath0 , but going from probability measures to dirac masses is often the sore point of many rigidity questions . in the case of a proper cat(0 )",

    "the first step in the identification of a poisson boundary in @xcite is the proof that the set of non - terminating ultrafilters is not empty , under the assumption that the action is essential and the cat(0 ) cube complex is cocompact .",
    "the same assertion with the cocompactness of @xmath0 replaced by the non - existence of @xmath21-fixed points in the cat(0 ) boundary follows from our proof that the boundary map takes values into the set of the non - terminating ultrafilters .",
