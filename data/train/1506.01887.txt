    "the famous hadwiger - nelson problem asks for the minimum number of colours required to colour the euclidean plane @xmath2 in such a way that no two points at distance 1 from each other have the same colour .",
    "the question can be equivalently stated in the graph theory language : recall that a _ colouring _ of a graph @xmath17 is a function @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 is a set of colours ) such that every two adjacent vertices @xmath20 satisfy @xmath21 .",
    "the _ chromatic number _",
    "@xmath22 of @xmath10 is the minimal cardinality of the set of colours to colour @xmath10 .",
    "therefore the hadwiger - nelson problem is about determining the chromatic number of the graph on the set of vertices @xmath2 with vertices in distance one adjacent - it is called _ unit distance graph _ and in this article will be denoted by @xmath14}$ ] ( the notation will be justified shortly ) .",
    "the problem was originally proposed by edward nelson in 1950 and was made publicly known by hugo hadwiger @xcite .",
    "pionners on the topic observed the following bounds : nelson first showed that at least @xmath23 colours are needed ( see the proof by mosers @xcite which uses the so - called moser spindle ) and john isbell was first to prove that @xmath24 colours are enough ( this result was published by hadwiger @xcite ) .",
    "somehow surprisingly , the aforementioned bounds remain unchanged since their origin in 1950 s , i.e. for more than 60 years nobody has found nothing sharper than @xmath25 - as long as we consider the full generality .",
    "nevetheless , advanced studies on the question , its subproblems and other related topics provide some understanding .",
    "for example , if we consider only measurable colourings ( i.e. with measurable colours ) then at least @xmath26 colours are necessary @xcite and if colouring of the plane consists of regions bounded by jordan curves then at least @xmath27 colours are required @xcite .",
    "generally , across the decades the hadwiger - nelson problem inspired many interesting results in the touchpoint of combinatorics and geometry , a vast number of challenging problems and various applications .",
    "one of possible ways to generalise the first question was presented by exoo @xcite .",
    "he considered graphs on the set of vertices @xmath2 with vertices in distance in the interval @xmath3 $ ] , we denote such graphs by @xmath1}$ ] .",
    "how many colours would be enough to colour such a graph , depending on @xmath5 and @xmath6 ?",
    "are there some important ranges of those parameters ?",
    "the other path for research leading from the hadwiger - nelson problem concerns different models of graphs colouring . in the majority of this article we investigate fractional colourings , in some sense a generalisation of the classic colouring : every vertex gets a @xmath8-elemental set of colours from the set of colours ( of size @xmath13 ) and the sets for adjacent vertices have to be disjoint .",
    "the quality of such a colouring is measured by the fraction @xmath12 and the fractional chromatic number is the infimum of such fractions ( one can also ask for the best fraction with a fixed @xmath8 ) . it can be seen as in this case every single colour is just a @xmath28-size part of a complete colour , so we divide complete colours from the classic colouring to somehow save a bit by combining partitioned colours in a clever way .",
    "it turns out that in fact we can save much using fractional colouring : fractional chromatic number is always lower or equal to chromatic number of a given graph , but the difference can be arbitrarily large .",
    "the fractional chromatic number of the graph @xmath14}$ ] has been studied in the literature .",
    "the best upper bound is due to hochbeg and odonnell @xcite ( based on an idea by fisher and ullman @xcite of looking for a dense subset of the plane which avoids unit distance ) and the best lower bound ( using a finite sugraph of the plane ) can be found in the book of scheinerman and ullman @xcite ( alongside with a good explanation of the upper bound ) : @xmath29})\\leq 4.36 $ ] .",
    "note that the upper bound is much smaller than the upper bound for @xmath30})$ ] .",
    "colouring of such geometrical graphs has also some significant practical motivations in telecommunication .",
    "we will briefly describe an example .",
    "more on this topic can be found in the paper of walczak and wojciechowski @xcite .",
    "consider the following problem : we are given a set of transmitters with equal ranges placed in some area ( assume that ranges are equal to @xmath0 ) - some of them are in each other range , and some of them are not .",
    "if two transmitters are in each other s range , we assume that they can quickly agree on their communication ( there are algorithms for it ) . if two transmitters are not in each other s range but have a common neighbour @xmath31 , then it is possible that @xmath32 and @xmath33 would try to transmit to @xmath31 in the same time - in this case @xmath31 can not listen to both messages .",
    "hence we have a conflict which can not be solved by a direct communication between @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "if two transmitters @xmath32 and @xmath33 are not in each other s range and do not have a common neighbour , then there is no conflict .",
    "the problem is to assign time - slots for transmitters ( in an equitable way ) such that no two conflicted transmitters share a time interval .",
    "how we can use graph colouring in this problem ? we can create the graph @xmath10 of conflicts for this network of transmitters : vertices correspond to transmitters and two vertices are adjacent if the corresponding transmitters @xmath34 , @xmath35 are at distance grater than @xmath0 and have a common transmitter in their respective ranges ( note that it is possible only if @xmath34 and @xmath35 are at distance in the set @xmath36 $ ] ) . hence , using a @xmath13-colouring of @xmath10 , such that each colour corresponds to one time - slot is one of the possible ways of constructing a proper transmission - schedule . by the definition of colouring",
    ", the produced schedule does not contain any pair of conflicted transmitters sharing their time of transmission , and every transmitter gets the same amount of time in one cycle of transmission .",
    "the length of the schedule is @xmath13 .",
    "on the other hand , we can make use of a fractional colouring of @xmath10 .",
    "since we demand that in one cycle of transmission every transmitter gets a unit of time , then every colour in a fractional coloring corresponds to interval of length @xmath28 of the time unit .",
    "both conflict - freeness and equitability are satisfied in this colouring model also , and ( if we used @xmath13 colours ) the length of the schedule is @xmath12 .",
    "the relation between considered colouring models imply that fractional colouring can possibly produce a shorter schedule in comparison to classic colouring , which ( in real world ) means : we can save a bit of time .",
    "however , the technical constraints imply that too big values of @xmath8 are not accepted - too fragmented schedule is not practical .",
    "this issue plays important role in our work - we devote a part of this article to fractional colourings with small @xmath8.    now , consider a graph on the set of vertices @xmath2 with vertices at distance in the set @xmath37 $ ] adjacent , which will be denoted in this article as @xmath16}$ ] . clearly , every conflict graph of a transmitters network as described above is a subgraph of @xmath16}$ ] .",
    "therefore , any colouring or fractional colouring of infinite @xmath16}$ ] induce , respectively , a colouring or a fractional colouring of a given finite conflict graph . hence , we get a universal scheme for any network .",
    "additionally , this universal scheme works also if the transmitters are placed on moving vehicles ( thus changing the conflict graph ) .",
    "this is an indisputable advantage over using standard colouring algorithms for a given conflict graph .",
    "first , we need to formally define fractional and classic colouring of graphs .",
    "colouring of a graph @xmath17 with @xmath13 colours ( or @xmath13-colouring ) is an assignment of colours @xmath38 to the vertices of @xmath10 such that no two adjacent vertices have the same colour .",
    "the smallest number of colours needed to colour a graph @xmath10 is called chromatic number and denoted by @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath39 be a family of all @xmath8-elemental subsets of @xmath40 .",
    "+ @xmath8-fold colouring of graph @xmath17 is an assignment of @xmath8-element sets of colours to the vertices of @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath41  such that for any two adjacent vertices @xmath42 we have @xmath43 .",
    "+ the smallest number of colours @xmath13 needed for a @xmath8-fold colouring of a graph @xmath10 is called the @xmath8-fold chromatic number and denoted by @xmath44 .",
    "the fractional chromatic number is defined to be:@xmath45    since an @xmath0-fold colouring of a graph is just a classic colouring , then @xmath46 .",
    "now , we will present two possible , equivalent notions of graphs on the euclidean plane we are considering in this work .",
    "the first is due to exoo @xcite .",
    "the second is introduced in this paper and is more convenient for our work , except the section [ s_jarek ] .",
    "an @xmath47-unit distance graph denoted by @xmath48 is a graph whose vertices are all points of the plane , in which two points are adjacent if their distance @xmath49 satisfies @xmath50 , i.e. + @xmath51    a graph @xmath1}$ ] is a graph whose vertices are all points of the plane @xmath52 , in which two points are adjacent if their distance @xmath49 satisfies @xmath53 .",

    "the classic hadwiger - nelson problem is considered to be very difficult , in particular giving a better general lower bound than @xmath23 . in his article exoo @xcite looked for values of @xmath47 such that we can determine the chromatic number of @xmath57 and he succeed in finding some such values .",
