    "the discovery of high t@xmath2 superconductivity in lao@xmath3f@xmath4feas has initiated a detailed investigation of these and related iron based compounds with the ultimate aim to identify new high temperature superconductors@xcite .",
    "many binary , ternary and quaternary compounds have been synthesized and investigated experimentally , some of which were quickly found to exhibit high t@xmath2 superconductivity with electron or hole doping or under pressure or intrinsically @xcite . meanwhile , several closely related and physically interesting systems have also been studied .",
    "an interesting example is the bamn@xmath0as@xmath0 compound , which has the same layered tetragonal thcr@xmath0si@xmath0-type crystal structure as the bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 at room temperature@xcite .",
    "bamn@xmath0as@xmath0 is an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) insulator with a small gap ; while bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 , a parent compound of the fe - based high t@xmath2 superconductors , is an afm metal at low temperatures .",
    "the more localized behavior of the ordered magnetic state in the mn - based system suggests that electronic correlations in this system are stronger or more efficient in changing the electronic properties of the material .",
    "a closer , comparative investigation of distinct transition metal ions therefore promises to reveal further whether iron is indeed special among its neighbors in the periodic table .",
    "this is also expected on qualitative grounds on the basis of the hund s rule picture@xcite .    theoretically , the description of the normal states for iron pnictide superconductors is complicated by the multi - orbital nature and the presence of electron correlation effects .",
    "interesting results can be obtained from low energy theories that are primarily concerned with states in the immediate vicinity of the fermi surface@xcite .",
    "however , material specific insight often requires a careful analysis of states over a larger energy window . in the iron pinctide and",
    "chalcogenides the strength of the correlations is controlled by the hund s rule coupling @xmath1 , rather than by the hubbard @xmath5 or the p - d charge transfer energy@xcite .",
    "this makes these materials a new class of correlated metals , different from doped mott or charge transfer insulators .",
    "calculations based on density functional theory ( dft ) usually yield too wide fe 3d bands and too large magnetic moment in the afm ground state@xcite .",
    "recently the afm phase of the iron pnictide parent compounds has been successfully described by using a combination of dft and dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) with full charge self - consistency@xcite .",
    "these investigations clearly demonstrated the important role played by the hund s rule coupling @xmath1 for the magnetic and electronic properties of the iron pnictides .",
    "a systematic analysis of a large class of fe - based materials further demonstrated that the nature and strength of local correlations are rather universal , while material specifics result from changes in the kinetic energy , amplified by the frustrated nature of electron hopping path due to fe - as - fe and direct fe - fe overlaps@xcite .",
    "this universality in the value of the local coulomb interactions @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath1 only exists if one includes in addition to the fe-3d states at least the as 4p orbitals .",
    "downfolding to models with iron states only is sufficient to lead to material specific variations in the local correlations . in view of these insights",
    "is it important to compare the behavior of fe - based systems with systems based on other transition metals , also in view of the ongoing debate whether these systems should be considered weakly or strongly correlated .    on a technical level ,",
    "quite a few efforts have been devoted to study the electronic and magnetic properties of the systems using the gutzwiller variational method@xcite and simplified tight - binding models@xcite with the particular appeal that the gutzwiller approach is computationally cheaper if compared to more sophisticated dmft approaches such as the usage of quantum monte carlo algorithms .",
    "for example .",
    "the experimental magnetic moment was obtained in a three band hubbard model of laofeas which contains only fe 3d @xmath7 orbitals@xcite .",
    "calculations based on the five - band model show that the @xmath8 orbitals are also important and the system exhibits a sharp transition from paramagnetic ( pm ) state to afm state with large magnetic moment when @xmath1  increases , which is different from the results of three - band model@xcite .",
    "another important question is whether , in addition to the fe 3d @xmath8 orbitals , the inclusion of as 4p elections is required for a more quantitative description of the afm and paramagnetic phases . finally , recent calculations for laofeas  based on the lda+gutzwiller approach that includes a fe3d  as4p wannier - orbital basis does indeed reproduce the experimentally observed small ordered magnetic moment over a large region of ( @xmath9 ) parameter space@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we report a comparative study of the bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 and bamn@xmath0as@xmath0  on the electronic and magnetic properties by investigating the fe / mn d - band model and the ddp - model that includes fe / mn 3d , ba 5d , and as 4p orbitals with gutzwiller approximation@xcite which has been shown to be equivalent to a slave - boson mean field theory@xcite . the paramagnetic phase for the two systems",

    "bamn@xmath0as@xmath0 is shown to be a more correlated material than bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "the screening effect of the as 4p electrons is evident by the comparison between the results of the fe / mn d - model and those of the ddp - model or lda+gutzwiller method .",
    "the key difference in the behavior of these systems is shown to be the distinct electron count of the 3d states , a result that is robust against changes in the detailed description of these systems .",
    "while the even number of electrons for an fe site requires that the system undergoes an orbitally selective mott transition , mn with five electrons can more easily localize and therefore has a much stronger tendency towards large moment magnetism and mott localization , even for the nominally same values of the coulomb interactions .",
    "the prospect to tune the tendency towards localization by varying the transition metal ions may therefore play an important role in optimizing the strength of electronic correlations for high temperature superconductivity .",

    "<S> the screening effect of the main as 4p electrons to the correlated fe / mn 3d electrons is evident by the systematic shift of the results to larger hund s rule coupling j side from the ddp - model compared with those from the d - model . a gradual transition from paramagnetic state to the antiferromagnetic ground state with increasing @xmath1  </S>",
    "<S> is obtained for the models of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 which has a small experimental magnetic moment ; while a rather sharp jump occurs for the models of bamn@xmath0as@xmath0 , which has a large experimental magnetic moment . </S>",
    "<S> the key difference between the two systems is shown to be the d - level occupation . </S>",
    "<S> bamn@xmath0as@xmath0 , with approximately five d - electrons per mn atom , is for same values of the electron correlations closer to the transition to a mott insulating state than bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 . here </S>",
    "<S> an orbitally selective mott transition , required for a system with close to six electrons only occurs at significantly larger values for the coulomb interactions . </S>"
