    "electrical impedance tomography ( eit ) , an technique for imaging distribution of the conductivity distribution of conducting objects from surface electrical measurements , is an interesting and important problem which is arising in physics , medical science , material engineering , and so on , all domains highly related with human life .",
    "related works can be found in @xcite and reference therein .",
    "however , due to the ill - posedness and inherent non - linearity of problem , it remains a challenging research area . in recent research , various remarkable imaging techniques proposed , many of them based on the newton - type iteration method , refer to @xcite and references therein . for a successful application of such method , a good initial guess that is close to the unknown target",
    "is essentially required .",
    "if one proceed without a good initial guess , issue such as non - convergence , the occurrence of several minima , and large computational costs may arise .",
    "moreover , iteration method often requires suitable regularization terms that highly depend on the specific problem at hand .    for this purpose ,",
    "various non - iterative methods are also developed as an alternatives , e.g. , a real - time algorithm for finding location of conductivity inhomogeneity @xcite , simple pole method @xcite , and end - point location search algorithm of thin conductivity inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to develop a fast , non - iterative imaging algorithm of small conductivity inclusion embedded in a homogeneous domain from boundary measurement by adopting famous topological derivative concept @xcite . by applying asymptotic expansion formula in the existence of conductivity inclusion of small diameter @xcite , we can easily derive desired derivative and design a fast ( only requires one - step iteration procedure by solving an adjoint problem ) imaging algorithm .",
    "although , the result via topological derivative does not guarantee complete shape of unknown target , it will be a good initial guess of newton - type iteration method .",
    "this paper organized as follows . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    ", we briefly review basic mathematical model of direct conductivity problem and introduce the asymptotic expansion formula due to the existence of small inclusion . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    ", we apply asymptotic expansion formula in order to rigorously and easily derive the topological derivative and develop a one - step iterative imaging algorithm . in the following section [ sec:4 ]",
    "numerical experiments are shown .",
    "section [ sec:5 ] contains a brief conclusion .",
    "let @xmath0 be a smooth , bounded domain that represents a homogeneous medium .",
    "we assume that this medium contains a conductivity inclusion @xmath1 with small diameter @xmath2 represented as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is some fixed bounded domain containing the origin that completely embedded in @xmath5 . throughout this paper , we denote @xmath6 and @xmath7 are two - dimensional vectors and assume that @xmath1 does not touch the boundary @xmath8 , i.e. , there exists positive constant @xmath9 such that @xmath10    assume that every materials are fully characterized by their electrical conductivity .",
    "let @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the conductivity of the domain @xmath5 and inclusion @xmath1 , respectively . by using this notation",
    ", we can introduce the following piecewise constant conductivity : @xmath13 in this paper , for the sake , we assume that @xmath14 .    let @xmath15 be the steady state voltage potential in the presence of the inclusion @xmath1 , that is , the unique solution to @xmath16 with the neumann boundary condition @xmath17 and with the compatibility condition @xmath18 here @xmath19 denote the unit outer normal to @xmath20 at @xmath21 and the function @xmath22 represents the applied boundary current satisfies the compatibility condition @xmath23    let us denote @xmath24 be the background potential induced by the current @xmath25 in the domain @xmath5 without @xmath1 , that is , the unique solution to @xmath26 with the neumann boundary condition @xmath27 and normalization condition to restore uniqueness @xmath28",
    "then asymptotic expansion formula in the presence of @xmath1 can be written as follows :    let @xmath0 be a bounded , smooth domain .",
    "then for sufficiently small @xmath2 , the asymptotic expansion formula due to the presence of small inclusion @xmath29 can be expressed in terms of the magnitude of diameter @xmath2 as : @xmath30 for each @xmath31 on @xmath20 . here the remaining term @xmath32 is uniform in @xmath33 , @xmath34 denotes the neumann function for the domain @xmath5 @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the symmetric matrix associated with the inclusion @xmath1 and the conductivities @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "specially , if @xmath1 is a ball with radius @xmath2 , @xmath36 is given by @xmath39",
    "at this stage , we derive the topological derivative in order to establish an imaging algorithm of small conductivity inclusion @xmath40 . for a more detailed discussion about the topological derivative , we recommend research articles @xcite .    the topological derivative measures the influence of creating a small ball @xmath40 ( or crack , etc . ) with small radius @xmath41 at a certain point @xmath7 inside the domain @xmath5  we denote @xmath42 as the such domain . if we assume that the boundaries @xmath20 and @xmath43 are sufficiently smooth , by considering a cost functional @xmath44 , the topological derivative @xmath45 is defined as @xmath46 where @xmath47 as @xmath48 .",
    "notice that the function @xmath49 is mainly defined by geometrical factors of the created shape ( here , @xmath40 ) . with this definition ( [ topderivative ] )",
    ", we have the asymptotic expansion : @xmath50    suppose that @xmath5 contains a thin inclusion @xmath1 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , be @xmath53 given functions denotes the boundary condition on @xmath20 and @xmath54 is the solution to the problem in the presence of @xmath1 : @xmath55 with this , construct @xmath56 as the solutions to the following problem in the absence of inclusion : @xmath57 let us define following discrepancy function : @xmath58    in order to derive the topological derivative @xmath45 , let us create @xmath40 inside the domain @xmath5 and denote @xmath59 be the solutions of the following problem in the presence of @xmath40 : @xmath60 where a piecewise constant @xmath61 can be defined similarly with ( [ epst ] ) . with this , calculation of the topological derivative can be carried out as follows :    the topological derivative @xmath45 of the discrepancy function @xmath44 of ( [ discrepancy ] )",
    "can be written as follows : @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 here , @xmath65 and @xmath66 denotes the real - part and complex conjugate of @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "adjoint state @xmath68 is defined as the solution to @xmath69    let us apply equation ( [ asymptoticexpansion ] ) to ( [ disfunc ] ) then we can compute @xmath70 as follows : @xmath71 where @xmath72 by applying asymptotic expansion formula ( [ asymptoticexpansion ] ) and equations ( [ neumannfunction ] ) and ( [ forwardadjoint ] ) , @xmath73 can be written : @xmath74 for @xmath52 . therefore , by ( [ matrixm ] ) , @xmath75 finally , by taking real part of ( [ jsigma ] ) , we can obtain equations ( [ functionrho ] ) and ( [ topsigma ] ) .",
    "from now on , we identify the structure of topological derivative ( [ topsigma ] ) and discuss certain properties .",
    "since @xmath76 satisfies ( [ forwardadjoint ] ) , following relations hold for @xmath77 , @xmath78    with them , applying boundary condition of ( [ forwardadjoint ] ) and asymptotic expansion formula ( [ asymptoticexpansion ] ) yields @xmath79 therefore , ( [ topsigma ] ) can be written as follows : @xmath80\\cdot\\overline{\\nabla u_0^{(l)}({\\mathbf{z}})}\\right\\}\\\\    & = \\pi r^2\\mbox{re}\\left\\{\\nabla u_0^{(l)}({\\mathbf{x}})\\cdot\\mathbb{m}({\\mathbf{x}})\\cdot\\overline{\\nabla u_0^{(l)}({\\mathbf{z}})}\\left(\\int_{\\partial\\omega}\\nabla_{{\\mathbf{x}}}\\mathcal{n}({\\mathbf{x}},{\\mathbf{y}})\\nabla_{{\\mathbf{z}}}\\mathcal{n}({\\mathbf{z}},{\\mathbf{y}})ds({\\mathbf{y}})\\right)\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from the fact that in the two - dimensional space , neumann function can be decomposed with the singular and regular parts : @xmath81 where @xmath82 for any @xmath83 and solves @xmath84    particularly , when the domain is a ball with radius @xmath85 centered at origin , neumann function is written by ( see @xcite ) @xmath86    with this decomposition , we consider the following value @xmath87    note that since @xmath82 , there is no blowup of @xmath88 so that there exists a constant @xmath89 such that @xmath90 hence applying hlder s inequality yields @xmath91 where @xmath92 means the length of @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath33 and @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "hence @xmath95 since @xmath77 and @xmath93 , we must consider the singularity in @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "for this purpose , we generate a ball @xmath98 of small radius @xmath99 centered at @xmath31 and separate @xmath20 into @xmath100 and @xmath101 , refer to figure [ fig:2 ]",
    ". then @xmath102 and @xmath103 therefore , we can conclude that since @xmath104 there is no blowup .",
    "therefore , the structure of normalized topological derivative ( [ topsigma ] ) will be of the form : @xmath105     ( red line ) and @xmath106 ( green line).,scaledwidth=30.0% ]      in practice , most of eit systems generally apply constant current sources in several direction so that the boundary condition ( [ boundary ] ) can be written with for a constant vector @xmath107 , @xmath52 , @xmath108 then since background potential @xmath109 is @xmath110 normalized topological derivative ( [ topsigma ] ) becomes @xmath111 therefore , ( [ topsigma ] ) does not offers any information of @xmath33 .",
    "this is a reason that why topological derivative concept can not be applied to the eit problem .",
    "this is motivated from the original idea in @xcite .",
    "we would like to mention @xcite for its application .",
    "suppose that there is only one inhomogeneity @xmath1 exists in @xmath5 .",
    "let us consider the following boundary conditions @xmath112 then it is easy to observe that @xmath113 are satisfy ( [ forwardabsence ] ) when the boundary conditions are @xmath114 and @xmath115 , respectively . here , @xmath116 is a positive real number , @xmath117 is an arbitrary vector on the two - dimensional unit circle @xmath118 and @xmath119 is orthogonal to @xmath120 with @xmath121 . in this paper",
    ", we set @xmath122^\\bot=[\\theta_2,-\\theta_1]$ ] .",
    "we introduce an alternative topological derivatives with respect to @xmath114 and @xmath115 as @xmath123 where @xmath124 and @xmath125 satisfy ( [ forwardadjoint ] ) with respect to @xmath114 and @xmath115 , respectively .",
    "then , if @xmath53 is sufficiently large enough , we can obtain @xmath126 here , following identity used ( see @xcite ) ; for sufficiently large @xmath53 , @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the bessel function of order zero and of the first kind .",
    "therefore , normalized topological derivative will be of the form @xmath129 this gives some certain properties of @xmath130 summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "since @xmath128 reaches its maximum value @xmath131 at @xmath132 , @xmath133 will plot its maximum value at @xmath134 so that we can identify the location of @xmath1 .",
    "2 .   resolution of image is highly depends on the value of @xmath116 and @xmath53 .",
    "based on the property of @xmath128 ( see figure [ plotbesselfunction ] ) , one can obtain a result with high resolution if @xmath116 is sufficiently large .",
    "in contrast , if the value of @xmath116 is small , one can not identify the location of @xmath1 , refer to figure [ result1 ] .",
    "3 .   due to the assumption of ( [ touching ] ) ,",
    "if @xmath1 is ( nearly ) touching the boundary @xmath8 , it is very hard to conclude that @xmath133 yields a good image .",
    "asymptotic expansion formula ( [ asymptoticexpansion ] ) holds for small inhomogeneity in theory .",
    "therefore , when @xmath1 is an extended target , further analysis of @xmath133 is required .",

    "in this section , a numerical result is shown for showing the effectiveness of ( [ atd ] ) . for this , we take the domain @xmath5 to be the unit circle and we insert one inhomogeneity @xmath138 in the shape of ball with the radius @xmath139 , the location @xmath140^t$ ] , and the conductivity @xmath141 .",
