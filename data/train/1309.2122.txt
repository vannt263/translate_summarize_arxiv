    "nonequilibrium systems abound in nature , with examples encompassing different branches of science .",
    "although there has been much recent progress in characterizing and understanding some features of nonequilibrium steady states @xcite , developing a general principle akin to the one due to gibbs - boltzmann for equilibrium has been one of the greatest challenges of modern statistical physics . in this respect , it is instructive to develop and analyze simple models in order to gain insights into features of nonequilibrium steady states that make them distinct from those in equilibrium . often , even for simple models , the steady state distribution has been nontrivial to obtain @xcite , and in many cases , has even remained elusive , thereby requiring one to resort to numerical simulations and approximation methods as only possible tools to analyze the steady states @xcite .    here , we develop a model of particles interacting via long - range interactions and evolving under a stochastic monte carlo dynamics , for which we could characterize exactly the steady state distribution .",
    "this is one of the first examples of engineering such a dynamics in the arena of long - range models interacting with an external heat bath , where all previous studies , to the best of our knowledge , have been based on langevin equations with noise terms that mimic the effect of the heat bath ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the model effectively simulates driven motion of particles in one dimension under the action of a mean - field .",
    "long - range interactions have generated considerable interest in recent years , with examples ranging from plasma physics to gravitational systems @xcite .",
    "these systems are characterized by an interparticle potential which in @xmath0 dimensions decays at large separation , @xmath1 , as @xmath2 , with @xmath3 .",
    "long - range interacting systems are different from the short - range ones in that they are generically non - additive , whereby thermodynamics quantities scale superlinearly with the system size .",
    "this latter feature manifests in properties , both static and dynamic , which are unusual for short - range systems @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we introduce a model of long - range interacting systems involving @xmath4 globally coupled particles moving on a circle , in presence of an external field acting individually on the particles , and in contact with an external heat bath at inverse temperature @xmath5 .",
    "this inverse temperature will coincide with the steady state temperature of the system only in equilibrium .",
    "the system evolves under a stochastic monte carlo dynamics .",
    "thus , a randomly chosen particle decides to move either to the left or to the right of its present position to take up a new location on the circle .",
    "the displacement from the initial position of the particle is a quenched random variable sampled independently from a common distribution for all the particles .",
    "the new location of the particle is accepted with a preassigned transition rate which is chosen in the following way . in the case",
    "the particle jumps symmetrically to the left and to the right , the transition rate is such that the stationary state of the system is the gibbs equilibrium state at the inverse temperature @xmath5 . in the case of asymmetric particle jump to the left and to the right , the system at long times reaches a nonequilibrium stationary state . considering the dynamics in the fokker - planck limit ( i.e.",
    ", only small jumps are allowed ) , we find that even with asymmetric jumps , if the external field is turned off and the jump distribution is a delta function so that all particles jump by the same amount , the steady state is in equilibrium in a suitable comoving frame obtained by performing a galilean transformation . in all other cases , the steady state is out of equilibrium . in the thermodynamic limit @xmath6 , the system is characterized by a single - particle distribution , that we compute exactly in the nonequilibrium steady state .",
    "we find that the distribution has a non - trivial form that reduces to the usual gibbsian distribution in the equilibrium limit .",
    "our results show excellent agreement with @xmath4-particle monte carlo simulations of the dynamics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ] , we give a precise definition of the model and discuss the master equation for the evolution of the @xmath4-particle phase space distribution . in section [ langevin ] , we consider the fokker - planck limit of the dynamics and obtain the exact steady state single - particle distribution in the limit @xmath7 . in section [ numerics ] , we compare @xmath4-particle monte carlo simulation results for the steady state single - particle distribution with our theoretical predictions in the fokker - planck limit , and demonstrate an excellent agreement between the two .",
    "the paper ends with conclusions .",
    "model consider a system of @xmath4 interacting particles moving on a unit circle , with the particles labelled as @xmath8 .",
    "let the angle @xmath9 denote the location of the @xmath10th particle on the circle . a microscopic configuration of the system is denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "the particles interact via a long - range potential @xmath12 $ ] , where @xmath13 is the coupling constant ; we consider @xmath14 in the following .",
    "application of an external field of strength @xmath15 produces a potential @xmath16 , so that the net potential energy is @xmath17 .",
    "the interaction @xmath18 has the same form as in the hamiltonian mean - field ( hmf ) model , a paradigmatic example of systems with long - range interactions @xcite .",
    "the fields @xmath15 s may be considered as quenched random variables with a common distribution @xmath19 .",
    "we now specify the dynamics of the system .",
    "we take hints from one of the first models devoted to studying characteristics of nonequilibrium steady states , the celebrated katz - lebowitz - spohn model @xcite .",
    "the configuration @xmath20 evolves according to a stochastic monte carlo dynamics . in discrete time , the dynamics in a small time @xmath21 involves every particle attempting to hop to a new position on the circle .",
    "the @xmath10th particle attempts with probability @xmath22 to move forward ( in the counter clockwise sense ) by an amount @xmath23 on the circle , @xmath24 , while with probability @xmath25 , it attempts to move backward by the amount @xmath23 , so that @xmath26 . in either case , the particle takes up the new position with probability @xmath27 .",
    "here , @xmath23 is a quenched random variable which for each particle is distributed according to a common distribution @xmath28 , while the quantity @xmath29 is the change in the potential energy due to the attempted hop from @xmath9 to @xmath30 : @xmath31 + h_i [ \\cos \\th_i'-\\cos \\th_i]$ ] .",
    "the function @xmath32 is of the form @xmath33 , where @xmath5 is the inverse temperature .",
    "the dynamics models the overdamped motion of the particles in contact with an external heat bath at inverse temperature @xmath5 and in presence of an external field .",
    "the case @xmath34 for which the particles move asymmetrically forward and backward mimics the action of an external drive that makes the particles to move in one preferential direction along the circle .",
    "note that in the dynamics , the initial ordering of particles on the circle is not conserved in time .",
    "taking @xmath23 s as quenched random variables introduces in the dynamics a different source of noise than the one due to the monte carlo update scheme which is annealed in nature .",
    "there are two sources of quenched randomness in the model through the presence of ( i ) jump lengths @xmath23 s , and ( ii ) field strengths @xmath15 s .",
    "later , we will consider specifically the first of the two sources of randomness , and take the @xmath15 s to be the same for all particles . in the conclusions",
    ", we will comment on how our analytical approach may be easily adapted to consider the randomness due to the @xmath15 s .",
    "let @xmath35 be the probability to observe the configuration @xmath36 at time @xmath37 . in the limit of continuous time",
    ", the evolution of @xmath38 is given by the master equation , which may be derived by considering the change in @xmath38 in a small time @xmath21 according to the dynamical evolution rules given above , and then taking the limit @xmath39 while keeping @xmath23 s fixed and finite . defining @xmath40 , we get the master equation as & & = _ i=1^n [ p(  ,_i - f_i, ",

    "the particles attempt to move forward and backward in a symmetric manner , and the system has an equilibrium stationary state in which the condition of detailed balance is satisfied with the measure @xmath43 . on the other hand , for @xmath44 , the particles have a preferred direction to hop on the circle , and the system at long times settles into a nonequilibrium stationary state , characterized by a violation of detailed balance leading to nonzero probability currents in phase space . in the absence of the external field ,",
    "the dynamics with @xmath42 samples the equilibrium measure of the brownian mean - field model of long - range interacting systems , developed as an extension of the microcanonical dynamics of the hmf model to a canonical dynamics that mimics the interaction of the system with an external heat bath @xcite .",
    "langevin here , we analyze the fokker - planck limit of the dynamics of our model . to this end",
    ", we first obtain the fokker - planck equation corresponding to the master equation ( [ master - eqn ] ) by making the assumption that @xmath45 , so that we may taylor expand functions in powers of @xmath23 s @xcite .",
