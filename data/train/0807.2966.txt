    "there are several methods for constructing discrete counterparts of integrable dynamical systems in classical mechanics .",
    "one is well - known veselov - moser discretization ( see @xcite ) . by this method , based on discrete variational principle ,",
    "many of discrete integrable systems are found ( see @xcite ) . in cases with discrete lagrangian , corresponding discrete map is poisson with respect to certain poisson structure .",
    "usually the discrete map is multi - valued .",
    "recently , hirota and kimura constructed explicit integrable discretizations of the euler and the lagrange cases of motion of a heavy rigid body fixed at a point using hirota s bilinear method @xcite .",
    "they found first integrals of motion and they solved equations in terms of elliptic functions .",
    "suris and petrera in @xcite found bi - hamiltonian structure for discrete euler top .",
    "our goal is to apply hirota - kimura method to the classical nonholonomic suslov problem .",
    "suslov in @xcite considered motion of a rigid body fixed at a point with projection of angular velocity to an axis fixed in the body equal to zero .",
    "solutions in terms of trigonometric and exponential functions are given as well in @xcite .",
    "there are various generalizations of classical suslov problem : integrable potential perturbations ( @xcite ) and higher - dimensional generalizations(@xcite ) . in @xcite fedorov and zenkov",
    "presented certain discretization of suslov problem based on the veselov - moser discretization and its extension to nonholonomic cases suggested in @xcite .",
    "obtained map is multi - valued .",
    "discrete trajectories asymptotically tend to discrete analogies of so - called steady - state rotations , the property characteristic for continuous case considered by suslov .",
    "moreover , fedorov and zenkov @xcite gave the equations in @xmath0-dimensional case and proved similar asymptotic behavior as in three - dimensional case .",
    "in the present paper we use the hirota - kimura method and get explicit discretization of the reduced suslov problem on the linear subspace of algebra @xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding map is not multi - valued .",
    "we gave one first integral which appears to be enough for integration . using a linear change of variables",
    ", we have found explicite solutions in terms of exponentional functions .",
    "( notice , that in the case of discretization given in @xcite , the explicite solutions are not known . ) presented discrete version of suslov case has similar asymptotic behavior as the continuous one .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "basic facts about the classical suslov problem are given . in section 3",
    "we present discrete equations of hirota - kimura type and we construct first integral of motion .",
    "integration procedure for discrete equations is performed in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we give the discrete equations for @xmath0-dimensional suslov case .",
    "the classical nonholonomic suslov problem is defined in @xcite .",
    "configuration space is lie group @xmath2 . in a bases fixed in the body ,",
    "the equations of the motion are : @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the angular velocity , and @xmath5 is the angular momentum , @xmath6 is the inertia operator , @xmath7 is a unit vector fixed in the body and @xmath8 is the lagrange multiplier . in a bases",
    "chosen such that @xmath9 and @xmath10,\\ ] ] the equations become : @xmath11    the first two equations are closed in @xmath12 and @xmath13 . after solving them one finds the lagrange multiplier @xmath8 as a function of time from the third equation .",
    "hence , for complete integrability by quadratures , only one first integral of motion is necessary .",
    "this is the energy integral as follows from easily .",
    "suslov in @xcite gave solutions of the system in terms of trigonometric and exponential functions .",
    "he observed a remarkable fact ( as the referee observed to be known before to walker and routh ) : the motion of the body asymptotically tends to a line of rotations with constant angular velocities which satisfy @xmath14 .",
    "in the spirit of hirota - kimura , a discrete counterpart of the first two equations and nonholonomic constraint of is : @xmath15\\\\ i_2&(\\widetilde{\\omega}_2-\\omega_2)+i_{23}(\\widetilde{\\omega}_3-\\omega_3)=\\epsilon\\big[\\frac{i_3}{2}(\\widetilde{\\omega}_1\\omega_3+\\omega_1\\widetilde{\\omega}_3)\\\\ & -i_{13}\\omega_3\\widetilde{\\omega}_3- \\frac{i_1}{2}(\\widetilde{\\omega}_1\\omega_3+\\omega_1\\widetilde{\\omega}_3)+\\frac{i_{23}}{2}(\\widetilde{\\omega}_1\\omega_2+\\omega_1\\widetilde{\\omega}_2)+ i_{13}\\omega_1\\widetilde{\\omega}_1\\big]\\\\ \\widetilde{\\omega}_3&=-\\omega_3 .",

    ", integral tends to the energy integral divided by constant .",

    "so , we have    [ t1 ] let constant @xmath39 satisfy and @xmath40 be arbitrary constant .",
    "then the function @xmath38 gives solutions of equation .    as a consequence we have the following statement :    let constant @xmath39 satisfy and @xmath40 be arbitrary constant .",
