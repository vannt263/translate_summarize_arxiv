    "finite size effects are important systematic effects in the monte carlo treatment of lattice field theories  @xcite .",
    "they become particularly large when the spectrum contains light particles as it happens for qcd with light quark masses . fortunately",
    ", chiral symmetry allows to investigate this region analytically by chiral perturbation theory ( chpt )  @xcite .",
    "in fact , through the detour of the chiral lagrangian , information about infinite volume qcd may be obtained from finite volume simulations with box size @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "an important restriction is that @xmath3 has to be satisfied , since the chiral theory is a low - energy ( long distance ) expansion .",
    "in addition , one has to distinguish whether @xmath1 is large compared to the compton wave length of the pion or not  @xcite .",
    "we shall here restrict ourselves to the former case but investigate what eq.([e_largel ] ) means quantitatively , by considering more than the leading order ( lo ) in the chiral expansion .    more specifically",
    ", we study the pion mass , @xmath4 , defined as an eigenvalue of the qcd hamiltonian in an @xmath5 box ( periodic boundary conditions ) , as it is extracted on a euclidean lattice for sufficiently large time .",
    "the goal is to calculate the shift @xmath0 with @xmath6 .",
    "0.6 cm    ( 12,6)(0,0 ) ( 0,3)(1,0)6.5 ( 7,3)(1,0)005 ( 6,0)(0,1)6 ( 1,5)(1.5,1.5 ) ( 0.85,4.85)@xmath7 ( 00,3)(1,0)2 ( 10,3)(1,0)2 ( 1.5,2)@xmath8 ( 9.5,2)@xmath9 ( 6,0.5)(0,1)5 ( 5.79,5.5)@xmath10 ( 6.5,1.4 )    90*integration *    the formula that we will use @xcite , @xmath11 relates the finite volume mass shift to the @xmath12-@xmath12 forward scattering amplitude @xmath13 in infinite volume .",
    "the subleading term involves @xmath14 .",
    "an additive piece referring to the 3-particle vertex present in the original formula @xcite does not contribute , because of parity conservation in qcd .",
    "since eq.([luscher ] ) builds on the unitarity of the theory , it holds only in full qcd , while a generalization to the quenched approximation seems impossible .",
    "a particular virtue of the lscher formula is an economic one : inserting on the r.h.s .",
    "the _ one - loop _ expression in chpt for @xmath13 in _ infinite volume _ and integrating along the contour depicted in fig .  1",
    ", one gets the asymptotic part of a formula which , otherwise , would have required a _ two - loop _ computation in a _ finite volume_.",
    "the simple @xmath15 forward kinematics @xmath16 with the crossing variable @xmath17 means that the forward scattering amplitude , after summing over isospin , reads @xmath18 where the isospin - invariant @xmath12-@xmath12 scattering amplitude @xmath19 as defined in @xcite enters .",
    "we now use the expression for @xmath20 at either leading or next - to - leading order @xcite , construct @xmath21 via eq.([forw ] ) , and insert the result into eq.([luscher ] ) . at lo",
    ", this procedure has already been used in @xcite .",
    "the lo chiral expression for the amplitude @xcite @xmath22 depends only on @xmath23 , and henceforth the forward amplitude eq.([forw ] ) is a constant and the relative shift @xmath24 follows in closed form . as noticed by gasser and leutwyler , this expression agrees with their one - loop result @xcite for @xmath4 , when the non - leading terms @xmath25 are dropped in the latter ( here , @xmath26 ) .",
    "in addition , at that order of chpt , one can check explicitly that the non - leading terms get very small around @xmath27 .",
    "we now investigate , whether the subleading chiral corrections in @xmath20 lead to a sizeable modification of the lo mass shift eq.([e_loshift ] ) . at nlo",
    "the chiral expression for the scattering amplitude is more involved than eq.([alo ] ) @xcite , and we evaluated the integral in eq.([luscher ] ) numerically .",
    "the low - energy constants which are needed at nlo are taken from @xcite , and  for the time being  the influence of their uncertainties is not investigated .",
    "it is instructive to first look at the integrand @xmath28 in eq.([luscher ] ) . in fig .",
    "2 we plot it , with @xmath13 constructed via lo and nlo chpt , respectively . since the calculation is based on chpt and the integration variable @xmath29 has the dimension of a mass , either the integrand tends to zero sufficiently fast beyond @xmath30mev or the calculation can not be trusted .",
    "the two integrands are close to each other when the pion is light and the box size sufficiently large . however , in the whole range of @xmath1 and @xmath31 studied in the graphs , the relative difference is substantial .",
    "the reason is that at nlo @xmath32 contains contributions which grow quite strongly with @xmath29 . to suppress these , a large @xmath1 in the kinematic factor @xmath33",
    "is needed .",
    "indeed , one roughly needs @xmath34 and @xmath35 , if one requires @xmath36 to differ only by a few percent from @xmath37 .",
    "note that in the graphs in fig .  2 also values of @xmath38",
    "appear which are too small for the asymptotic formula eq.([luscher ] ) to apply .",
    "we do this in order to check which value of @xmath1 is needed for a precise prediction for the _ integrand _ from chpt .",
    "in addition , it is an attempt to shed some light on the general question , what the condition @xmath39 in eq.([e_largel ] ) means numerically .",
    "this question is relevant also for applications of chpt in the regime @xmath40 , where eq.([luscher ] ) has no basis but where other expansions @xcite are applicable .    the relative mass shift @xmath41 is plotted in fig .",
    "one observes that for @xmath42 and @xmath43fm the predicted mass shift is significantly below 1% and decreases further when @xmath1 is increased . even though the difference between lo and nlo is not so small",
    ", we expect this to hold beyond nlo , on the basis of our preliminary numerical study of nnlo effects .",
    "larger mass shifts are predicted for a pion mass of e.g.  @xmath44mev , and box sizes below @xmath45fm . in this region , one would then like to correct lattice mc results for such effects , but it seems that the mass shifts of nlo chpt may only be trusted within around 20% ( of the very shift ) .",
    "we did not study @xmath46fm , since in this region , the `` distortion of the pion wave function '' due to finite @xmath1 may be large  @xcite , and we expect that higher order chpt contributions will at most describe the onset of such effects .    in summary , it appears that chpt may be applied to find out the region of parameters where the finite size effects are small and negligible compared to other errors of lattice qcd .",
    "we do , however , find that in the region where _ a correction for finite size effects is necessary _ , a _ lo chpt result is not sufficient _ to apply this correction with confidence . in order to really assess the precision of the nlo prediction",
    ", it will be interesting to include yet one more order in the scattering amplitude @xcite , but then the uncertainties in the needed low - energy constants have to be investigated in detail .",
