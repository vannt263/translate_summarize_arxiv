    "ultraluminous x - ray sources ( hereafter ulxs ) are bright x - ray sources with @xmath5  erg  s@xmath6 .",
    "these objects are not associated with the nuclei of galaxies , so are not powered by accretion onto a central super - massive black hole , but are too bright for sub - eddington accretion onto stellar - mass black holes that radiate isotropically .",
    "an obvious solution is therefore an object intermediate in mass between that of stellar mass and super - massive black holes : intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) , of mass @xmath7 10@xmath8 - 10@xmath9  @xmath10 , accreting at sub - eddington rates ( e.g. colbert & mushotzky 1999 ; miller & colbert 2004 ) .",
    "various pathways for the formation of imbhs have been suggested , both primordial ( from the collapse of population iii stars ; madau & rees 2001 ) , and ongoing ( runaway mergers of massive stars , and their subsequent collapse to a massive black hole , in the densest star - formation regions e.g. portegies - zwart et al .",
    "2004 ) , but problems persist in producing sufficient numbers of imbhs to tally with those seen in the local universe ( madhusudhan et al .",
    "thus an alternative must be considered : that the majority of ulxs are single stellar remnant black holes that accrete material from a close companion star , probably at super - eddington rates and/or with their x - ray emission subject to some degree of geometric beaming ( e.g. king et al .",
    "2001 , begelman 2002 ; see also roberts 2007 and references therein ) .",
    "more extreme beaming from relativistic jets seems unlikely due to the number of unbeamed sources that would need to be present in systems such as the cartwheel galaxy ( king 2004 )    either conclusion remains controversial , and the question of what underlies ulxs can only be ultimately solved by a direct mass measurement based on constraints placed by the binary orbit . until this",
    "is achieved , more indirect methods of determining the mass must be used in an attempt to constrain the nature of these accreting systems .",
    "a common method is to use the temperature of the accretion disc emission , together with its luminosity , to determine the mass as shakura - sunyaev models predict the disc temperature @xmath11 kev ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "the highest signal - to - noise spectra of ulxs can often be well fitted by composite models of a disc together with a hard ( @xmath12 @xmath13 2 ) tail , with the low measured disc temperature of @xmath7 0.2  kev implying a high black hole mass of @xmath7 10@xmath14 @xmath15 ( e.g. miller et al .",
    "2003 ; kaaret et al . 2003 ; miller , fabian & miller 2004 ) .",
    "this supports the imbh interpretation , and the resulting very sub - eddington accretion rates ( @xmath13 0.1@xmath16 ) would most likely be associated with the low / hard state in black hole binaries ( bhbs ) , consistent with the observed hard tail .    however , it is also clear from many studies of bhbs that disc models only give reliable results when the x - ray spectrum is dominated by this component ( the high / soft or thermal dominant state ) ( done & kubota 2006 ) .",
    "the derived disc temperature is increasingly distorted as the tail increases in importance , with very low temperature , high luminosity discs ( implying a much larger mass black hole than is known to be present ! ) seen when both tail and disc are strongest , as in the very high or steep power law state ( kubota & done 2004 , done & kubota 2006 ) .",
    "the ulx spectral decompositions of miller et al .",
    "( 2004 ) all have strong tails ( @xmath17 of the 0.3 - 10 kev flux ; stobbart , roberts & wilms 2006 , hereafter srw06 ) , so a straightforward interpretation of the derived disc parameters is unlikely to give a robust mass estimator .",
    "however , the best data also shows the limitations of this simple spectral fitting . there is clear evidence for curvature of the tail at the highest energies , with a deficit of photons above 5  kev ( roberts et al .",
    "2005 ; srw06 ; miyawaki et al .",
    "such curvature is never seen in the low / hard state at these low energies .",
    "only the very high state shows curvature at such low energies , but these generally have spectra which are steep",
    ". the temporal variability also does not correspond to that expected from an imbh in this ( or any other ) state .",
    "the simple disc and tail spectral decomposition shows that the tail dominates the _ xmm - newton _ band pass , so by analogy with the bhbs this emission should be strongly variable .",
    "xmm - newton _ ulx light curves show only upper limits on the variability power consistent with the poisson noise level for the data ( feng & kaaret 2005 ) .",
    "thus neither the spectral nor variability properties convincingly correspond to any of the accretion states known in bhbs , making it unlikely that ulxs are powered by sub - eddington flows onto an imbh ( roberts 2007 ) .",
    "this conclusion is strongly supported by population studies of ulxs .",
    "the sheer numbers observed in starburst galaxies together with their short lifetimes ( implied by their location in regions of active star formation ) mean that an unrealistically large underlying population of imbhs must be present ( king 2004 ) .",
    "instead it is much more likely that the bulk of the population are the most extreme examples of high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) which somehow exceed the eddington limit .",
    "the high mass companion gives a natural origin for the high mass transfer rates required to power the observed luminosities ( rappaport , podsiadlowski & pfahl 2005 ) .",
    "it also explains the association of ulxs with star - forming regions ( fabbiano , zezas & murray 2001 ; lira et al .",
    "2002 ; gao et al . 2003 ) and the unbroken luminosity function connecting ulxs to the standard x - ray binary population ( grimm , gilfanov & sunyaev 2003 ) .",
    "indeed , direct evidence for ulxs possessing high mass donor stars comes from the identification of luminous , blue optical stellar counterparts to several nearby ulxs ( e.g. liu et al . 2004 ; kuntz et al .",
    "2005 ; roberts , levan & goad 2008 ) .",
    "many ulx host galaxies have sub - solar abundances ( e.g. lee et al 2006 ) .",
    "the lower opacity of subsolar material means that massive stars lose less mass through winds during their evolution , so potentially can collapse to form a relatively high mass black hole at the end of their stellar lifetime , with m@xmath18 @xmath19 80  @xmath15 ( fryer & kalogera 2001 ; heger et al .",
    "2003 ; belczynski , sadowski & rasio 2004 ; belczynski et al . 2009 ) .",
    "one such large stellar mass black hole was discovered in ic 10 x-1 , a wolf - rayet black hole binary .",
    "a radial velocity curve was constructed from repeated optical observations , which provided a mass estimate of 23 - 34 @xmath15 ( prestwich et al .",
    "2007 ; silverman & filippenko 2008 ) .",
    "nonetheless , even such massive stellar remnant black holes are required to be accreting at super - eddington rates to explain the observed luminosities of the brightest ulxs .",
    "thus the accretion flows in ulxs may not simply be scaled up versions of those seen in bhbs , as would be the case for the imbh , as suggested by the x - ray spectral modelling of miller et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and subsequent work .",
    "such black holes are not formed at the endpoint of a recent single stellar evolution , but require more exotic origins such as stellar mergers in a young super star cluster ( e.g. portegies - zwart & mcmillan 2002 ) or formation from primordial population iii stars in the high - redshift universe ( madau & rees 2001 ) . ] model where the flows are sub - eddington . instead ,",
    "observation of ulxs may allow us to probe a new regime of accretion physics , a new `` ultraluminous state '' ( roberts 2007 ; soria 2007 ) .    here",
    "we revisit the question of what the x - ray spectra of ulxs can tell us about the nature of their accretion flows , and how this constrains the nature of the accreting object , by utilising the best data currently available in the _ xmm - newton _ public archives .",
    "we choose to use the best available data as previous studies of samples of ulxs ( e.g. berghea et al .",
    "2008 ) , whilst providing interesting results , are ultimately limited in the conclusions they can draw by the moderate signal - to - noise of many ulx spectra . by using only the highest quality data from the widest band pass , highest sensitivity instruments available we can hope to avoid the ambiguity of previous analyses , and make definitive statements on the accretion processes in ulxs . the paper is arranged as follows .",
    "first we outline the sample selection , and the data reduction processes ( sections  [ section : selection ] & [ section : data ] ) .",
    "next we investigate the x - ray spectra using a variety of empirical and physical models , in order to both clarify the morphology of ulx spectra in the putative ultraluminous state , and to investigate the physical processes underlying this phenomenon ( section  [ section : spectral ] ) .",
    "finally we discuss the implications of our results for the nature of ulxs ( section  [ section : discussion ] ) .",

    "we now move on to the final stage in our analysis to further explore the results provided by comptonisation models .",
    "the models above implicitly assume that we can still observe the disc down to its innermost stable orbit .",
    "this assumption requires that the optically thick corona does not intercept our line of sight to the inner disc and that the underlying disc spectrum is independent of that of the corona ( see kubota & done 2004 ) .",
    "yet both assumptions are probably flawed .",
    "an optically thick corona could easily mask the innermost regions ( depending on its geometry : kubota & done 2004 ) .",
    "secondly , we must consider the energetics of both components .",
    "both the disc and the corona must be ultimately powered by gravitational energy release .",
    "if we are observing a powerful corona , this implies less energy is available for heating the disc ( svensson & zdziarski 1994 ) .",
    "the only code currently available that enables us to explore the effect of relaxing these assumptions is dkbbfth ( done & kubota 2006 ) .",
    "this was designed to model the extreme very high state spectra seen in bhbs such as xte j1550 - 564 and grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "it incorporates the energetic disc - corona coupling model of svensson & zdziarski ( 1994 ) , which assumes that the corona extends over the inner disc from @xmath31 to @xmath32 , taking a fraction @xmath33 of the gravitational energy available at these radii .",
    "only the remaining fraction @xmath34 is available to power the inner disc emission , so the inner disc is cooler , but more importantly , less luminous than it would be if the corona were not present .",
    "this distorted inner disc spectrum is the source of seed photons for the comptonisation ( done & kubota 2006 ) .",
    "this model has five free parameters ( only one more than in the purely phenomenological mcd plus power law model and the same as for all the disc plus comptonisation models ) .",
    "the first two are the temperature of the comptonising plasma , @xmath30 , and its optical depth ( parameterised by the asymptotic spectral index , @xmath12 ) .",
    "the disc is assumed to extend from some inner radius , @xmath35 , which is given by the overall normalisation of the model , and with a temperature distribution _ in the limit of no corona being present _ of @xmath36 i.e. as in the diskbb model .",
    "however , the model assumes that the corona extends homogeneously ( constant temperature and optical depth ) in a slab over the disc , from its inner radius to @xmath32 ( in units of the schwartzschild radius , @xmath37 ) . for all radii between this and @xmath35 ,",
    "the calculated disc temperature is @xmath38 where @xmath33 is the fraction of power dissipated in the corona ( assumed constant with radius ) which is self consistently calculated via iteration from the coronal spectral parameters ( done & kubota 2006 ) .",
    "the resulting disc luminosity underneath the corona is reduced by a factor @xmath34 , but only a fraction @xmath39 of this is seen directly , with the remainder being compton scattered by the corona ( done & kubota 2006 ) .    despite being more physically constrained",
    ", the model gives an equivalently good fit to the data as the disc plus comptonisation models discussed above .",
    "figure [ fig : chris ] shows this fit for ho",
    "ix x-1 , with the outer ( un - comptonised ) disc emission ( red solid line ) dominating at soft energies . the inner disc emission ( red dotted line ) is much lower than in standard disc models as much of the energy is powering the corona .",
    "these form the seed photons for the compton scattering , but since this scattering is in an optically thick corona , these photons are _ not _ seen as almost all of them are upscattered to form the comptonised spectrum ( solid green line ) .",
    "figure [ fig : montage ] shows the model fit to all our sources , with the pn data corrected for absorption to show the intrinsic spectral shape .",
    "this clearly shows the difficulties in interpreting the parameters from simple , phenomenological spectral fits .",
    "again , using ho ix x-1 as an example , the data have an inflection at soft energies that characterises the soft excess .",
    "the characteristic energy of this feature is interpreted as the peak of the disc emission in the mcd plus power - law model ( giving a very low temperature : hence imbhs ) , while the high energy break forms the peak of the disc temperature in single component disc models ( giving a very high temperature : too extreme even for stellar mass black holes ) . in these coupled disc - corona models ,",
    "the ` true ' disc temperature is not given by either of these observed features !",
    "the high energy break is from the very low plasma temperature of the comptonising region , while the low energy inflection occurs when the outer , un - comptonised disc emission starts to dominate the spectrum .",
    "the inferred intrinsic inner disc temperatures , recovered from the assumption of disc - corona energy partition , range from 0.3 @xmath13 @xmath40 @xmath13 1.2 kev with 8/12 giving fits where @xmath40 @xmath41 0.5 kev , which lies in the stellar mass black hole regime .",
    "this can be seen explicitly by converting the inferred inner radius into black hole mass assuming that the disc extends down to the last stable orbit around a schwarzschild black hole at @xmath42 .",
    "all these ` hot ' ulxs ( @xmath40 @xmath41 0.5 kev ) have inferred black hole masses @xmath43 , consistent with stellar mass black holes , and consequent derived @xmath44 .    however , a third of these source spectra are best fit by @xmath45 @xmath13 0.5 kev , hence giving black hole masses in the range 80 - 430  @xmath15 and _ sub_-eddington accretion rates assuming that the disc extends down to the last stable orbit .",
    "we propose instead that this very cool temperature and hence large radius is _ not _ associated with the direct disc emission but instead arises as the accretion rate increases beyond that of standard super - eddington accretion . in a super - critical accretion regime",
    ", the inner regions of the disc and corona may be blown off in the form of a wind , forming an optically thick photosphere out to large radii ( e.g. poutanen et al . 2007 ) .",
    "we return to this point in the next section .",
    "we have examined twelve of the highest quality ulx data sets currently available in the public archives of the _ xmm - newton _ telescope .",
    "initial characterisation of the spectrum of these sources reveals the presence of both a soft excess and a break at higher energies ( within the _ xmm - newton _ band pass ) .",
    "the existence of curvature at lower energies is apparent in many of the standard bhb accretion states , and is regularly fit by an accretion disc ( done , gierlinski & kubota 2007 ) .",
    "it is this standard practice which led to the suggestion that these objects were intermediate mass black holes , due to the low temperature of the apparent disc emission .",
    "however , the detection of a break or curvature at higher energies ( @xmath7  5  kev ) brings new insights .",
    "such a feature has been observed in ulxs previously ( e.g. foschini et al .",
    "2004 ; feng & kaaret 2005 ; srw06 ; miyawaki et al 2009 ) , but here we show that it is nearly ubiquitous in the highest quality spectral data , with @xmath46  10,000 counts .",
    "no such break at these low energies is observed in the high energy tail of any of the standard accretion states observed in bhbs ( remillard & mcclintock 2006 ; done , gierlinski & kubota 2007 ) kev and 20 - 30  kev , respectively cf .",
    "mcclintock & remillard ( 2006 ) .",
    "] so this challenges the basic assumption of the imbh model , which is that we are observing standard accretion states that are scaled with the mass of the compact object .",
    "thus we must consider the alternative , that we are observing a different accretion state than those generally seen in bhbs .",
    "a new accretion state would require us to be observing a different mass accretion rate with respect to eddington than those seen in the standard states . since these span @xmath47 ( mcclintock & remillard 2006 ) then this is most likely a super - eddington state , so requires a stellar mass rather than imbh accretor .",
    "we therefore suggest that a new observational state should be defined based on the characteristic signatures of ulxs . the * ultraluminous state * is one in which we observe a new combination of observational signatures ; both a cool disc and a break or roll over at high energies in the band pass of the _ xmm - newton _ telescope .",
    "we caution that high quality data is required for a clear identification ; the high energy break in particular is difficult to identify with less than @xmath48 counts in the x - ray spectrum .    in order to explore the physical origins of this state we applied more physically motivated models to the data .",
    "one theory that has been presented to explain such an accretion state is the ` slim disc ' model , where advection of radiation suppresses the emitted disc luminosity of the innermost regions ( abramowicz et al .",
    "we apply a simplifed model often used for such spectra , where the temperature profile in the disc is assumed to be @xmath49 @xmath50 , with @xmath1 a free parameter rather than fixed at @xmath51 as for standard discs ( watarai et al .",
    "our data give 0.4 @xmath52 @xmath1 @xmath52 0.6 , similar to the @xmath1 @xmath53 0.5 expected for advection dominated discs , but the derived inner disc temperatures are unrealistically high ( @xmath54 @xmath55 6 kev ) for one third of our sample .",
    "figure [ fig : diskpbb ] illustrates this for ngc 1313 x-1 , where @xmath56 @xmath7 8  kev .",
    "plainly , the disc temperature is set by the presence of the high energy break , but such high inner disc temperatures are not expected even for stellar mass black holes ( ebisawa et al 2003 ) .",
    "however , we caution against interpreting these parameters physically as the model fails to account for the inflection that occurs at @xmath7 2 kev .",
    "these slim disc models can not simultaneously produce _ both _ the soft excess at low energies _ and _ the high energy break seen in the high quality data used here , though this deficiency may be hidden in lower signal - to - noise data .    in order to explore the nature of these sources in more detail , we consider a combination of a disc plus comptonisation due to its successes in describing the emission of other accretion - powered bhb systems .",
    "two different comptonisation models are applied to the data , comptt and eqpair , giving two slightly different approximations to thermal compton up - scattering of accretion disc photons ( see figure [ fig : compton ] ) .",
    "irrespective of which model is used , we find evidence for a cool , optically thick corona , where the high energy break is set by the electron temperature of this comptonising plasma",
    ". the parameters of this corona are rather different than anything observed in any of the standard accretion states of bhbs .",
    "it has lower temperature and higher optical depth than even the most extreme optically thick corona seen in the very high state ( done & kubota 2006 ) .",
    "such material must block our view of the inner disc ( kubota & done 2004 ) , and most likely also changes the energy dissipated in the disc ( done & kubota 2006 ) .",
    "we attempt to recover the intrinsic disc spectrum by modelling a corona over the inner disc that both comptonises the inner regions of the disc and is energetically coupled to it .",
    "both corona and disc are ultimately powered by gravity , so increasing the power dissipated in the corona at a given radius must mean that the disc is less luminous than expected at that radius ( done & kubota 2006 ; svensson & zdziarski 1994 ) . again",
    "the parameters indicate a more extreme version of the very high state , but unlike the phenomenological disc plus comptonisation models , these coupled disc - corona models allow us to infer what the source would have looked like without any corona .",
    "the spectral energy distributions derived on the basis of this model can be put into a potential sequence of ulx spectra , as shown in figure [ fig : montage ] .",
    "the first class are those which have spectra which increase monotonically in @xmath57 , with maximum power output at the energy given by the high energy break .",
    "all these sources give a ` hot disc ' ( @xmath58  kev ) in the canonical mcd plus power - law fits , with the ` power - law ' producing the additional flux at the softest energies .",
    "this is probably due to the mcd model providing a poor description of the broader spectra expected from more realistic disc models ( done & davis 2008 ; hui & krolik 2008 ) .",
    "however , these spectra still look fairly similar to the standard disc spectra seen in the disc - dominated state ( ngc 2403 x-1 ; m81 x-6 and m33 x-8 ) .",
    "small amounts of emission from a hot corona can also contribute to the spectrum at the highest energies ( see e.g. the spectral decompositions for the most luminous states on xte j1817 - 330 in figure 4 of gierlinski , done & page 2009 ) .",
    "we note that all of these ulxs have luminosities @xmath59 erg s@xmath6 , so can be close to eddington for moderately massive ( @xmath60 ) stellar remnant black holes , similar to that found in ic 10 x-1 ( see introduction ) .",
    "the next source in the sequence , ngc 1313 x-2 , has a spectrum where the high energy emission seems stronger than expected from a disc dominated state , so this could instead be a type of very high state , again with a moderately massive stellar remnant black hole .",
    "hence , it appears as though the low luminosity end of the ulx population could potentially overlap with sub - eddington processes seen in the bhb , albeit for larger black holes .",
    "we will explore this in a future paper by characterising the properties of the galactic bhbs at high eddington fractions in the _ xmm - newton _ band pass .",
    "the next category are those where there is clearly a soft inflection as well as a high energy break , but where the total power still peaks at the high energy break ( ho ix x-1 ; ic 342 x-1 ; ngc 1313 x-1 ) .",
    "these are the ones where the simple disc plus ( broken ) power - law fits give a cool disc together with a high energy rollover , which we identify with a new _ ultraluminous _ state .",
    "for these data the coupled disc - corona models give an intrinsic disc temperature that is not given by either of these observed characteristic energies , and where the effect of comptonisation in an optically thick , low temperature corona , is most marked .",
    "these spectra do not correspond to any of the known states , but can form from a more extreme ( higher optical depth , lower temperature ) version of the very high state corona .",
    "these are typically brighter than those in the previous class ( though there is also substantial overlap in luminosity ) so are most likely super - eddington accretion flows .",
    "there is then a clear observational sequence of spectral shapes , through the sources where the ratio of power between comptonisation ( the high energy peak ) and the outer disc ( low energy peak ) steadily decreases , from ngc 5204 x-1 and ngc 4559 x-1 , to the most extreme systems , namely ho ii x-1 , ngc 5408 x-1 and ngc 55 ulx .",
    "these are the ones where the inferred intrinsic disc temperature from the coupled disc - corona model is @xmath61  kev , far lower than expected from stellar remnant accretion .    to understand these , we look first at what happens physically to the flow as it approaches and then exceeds the eddington limit .",
    "it has long been known that the eddington limit for a disc is somewhat different than that for spherical accretion ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) . a thin disc , which radiates at the eddington limit at all radii , has an integrated luminosity @xmath62 where @xmath63 = @xmath64 is the mass accretion rate scaled to that which gives the eddington luminosity for spherical accretion .",
    "however , this can only be achieved if excess energy over and above that expected from a constant mass inflow rate , radiating with constant efficiency , is somehow lost from the system .",
    "there are two ways to do this , either by changing the mass accretion rate as a function of radius through expelling the excess mass via winds ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; begelman et al .",
    "2006 ) or by changing the radiative efficiency by advecting the photons along with the flow ( slim discs , as above ) .",
    "importantly , both can operate simultaneously ( poutanen et al 2007 ) , as indeed is shown in the most recent 2d radiation hydrodynamic simulations of super - eddington accretion flows ( ohsuga 2006 ; 2007 ; 2009 ; kawashima et al . 2009 ; takeuchi , mineshige , & ohsuga 2009 ) .",
    "this then gives a possible framework to interpret our results .",
    "it is clear that the objects with @xmath7  1  kev disc emission are probably just more extreme versions of the brightest high and very high spectral states known from bhbs .",
    "the super - eddington , ultraluminous state sources are then distinguished by their cool , optically thick coronae and apparently cooler discs . one obvious source of higher optical depth in the corona is the increasing importance of winds as the source starts to accrete past the eddington limit , and this mass loading of the coronal particle acceleration mechanism leads to lower temperatures of the comptonising electrons .",
    "these winds will become increasingly important as the flows become increasingly super - eddington , completely enveloping the inner regions of the disc - corona out to an increasing photospheric radius ( as in ss 433 , poutanen et al .",
    "hence the observed temperature decreases in line with the stefan - boltzmann law ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; begelman et al .",
    "2006 ; poutanen et al .",
    "the outflow is inherently ( at least ) two dimensional , so viewing angle will change the apparent system luminosity ( ohsuga 2006 ; 2007 ) .",
    "we suggest the most extreme objects seen in our current sample , ngc 4559 x-1 , ho ii x-1 , ngc 5408 x-1 and ngc 55 ulx , are dominated by reprocessing in a wind , and that much of their luminosity output is channeled into kinetic energy .",
    "thus it seems most likely that we are seeing the ulx transit between the brightest high and very high states , through to a super - eddington _ ultraluminous _ state which is similar to the very high state but with lower temperature and higher optical depth in the corona , to a completely new ( hyper - accreting ) state where the wind dominates the spectrum . in none of these states",
    "do we require the presence of imbhs to explain the x - ray spectrum ; all can be explained by stellar mass black holes at high accretion rates , albeit perhaps black holes up to a few times larger than those known in our own galaxy .",
    "the highest quality data has been collated and utilised to both characterise the spectra of ultraluminous x - ray sources and to constrain their nature .",
    "these show that while some ulx ( typically the lowest luminosity ones ) have spectra which are probably similar to the high and ( especially ) the very high state in galactic bhbs , the majority show more complex curvature which can be modelled by a cool disc component together with a power - law which breaks / rolls - over above @xmath65 kev .",
    "this combination of spectral features is not commonly present in any of the known ( sub - eddington ) galactic bhb states , and we therefore propose these features as observational criteria for a new _ ultraluminous state _ and identify it with super - eddington accretion flows .",
    "more physical models for these spectra show they are not well fit by ( approximate , ` @xmath1-free ' ) slim disc models as these can not simultaneously produce both the soft excess and high energy break . instead",
    ", disc plus comptonisation models give a much better description of this complex curvature , indicating that the break above @xmath65  kev comes from a cool , optically thick corona .",
    "this suggests a more extreme version of the coronae seen in the very high state of bhbs , as might be expected for super - eddington flows .",
    "however , such coronae obscure the inner disc and alter its energetics ( done & kubota 2006 ) , so we model these effects to recover the intrinsic disc temperatures .",
    "many of these are in the range expected for stellar remnant black holes , showing that the apparent cool disc temperature derived from simple disc models does not require an imbh . however , there are some objects where the recovered disc temperature ( corrected for the corona ) is cooler than expected for a stellar remnant black hole .",
    "we suggest these are most likely to represent the most extreme super - eddington accretion flows , where the wind from the accretion disc becomes so powerful that it envelops the inner disc out to a large photospheric radius , producing the cool spectral component .",

    "<S> we revisit the question of the nature of ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) through a detailed investigation of their spectral shape , using the highest quality x - ray data available in the _ xmm - newton _ public archives ( @xmath0 counts in their epic spectrum ) . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that simple spectral models commonly used for the analysis and interpretation of ulxs ( power - law continuum and multi - colour disc blackbody models ) are inadequate in the face of such high quality data . </S>",
    "<S> instead we find two near ubiquitous features in the spectrum : a soft excess and a roll - over in the spectrum at energies above 3  kev . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate a range of more physical models to describe these data . </S>",
    "<S> slim discs which include radiation trapping ( approximated by a @xmath1-free disc model ) do not adequately fit the data , and several objects give unphysically high disc temperatures ( @xmath2  kev ) . instead , disc plus comptonised corona models fit the data well , but the derived corona is cool , and optically thick ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is unlike the @xmath4 coronae seen in galactic binaries , ruling out models where ulxs are powered by sub - eddington accretion onto an intermediate mass black hole despite many objects having apparently cool disc temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that these observed disc temperatures are not a good indicator of the black hole mass as the powerful , optically thick corona drains energy from the inner disc , and obscures it . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the intrinsic ( corona - less ) disc temperature , and demonstrate that in most cases it lies in the regime of stellar mass black holes . </S>",
    "<S> these objects have spectra which range from those similar to the highest mass accretion rate states in galactic binaries ( a single peak at 23  kev ) , to those which clearly have two peaks , one at energies below 1  kev ( from the outer , uncomptonised disc ) and one above 3  kev ( from the comptonised , inner disc ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , a few ulxs have a significantly cooler corrected disc temperature ; we suggest that these are the most extreme stellar mass black hole accretors , in which a massive wind completely envelopes the inner disc regions , creating a cool photosphere . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that ulxs provide us with an observational template for the transition between eddington and super - eddington accretion flows , with the latter occupying a new _ ultraluminous _ accretion state .    </S>",
