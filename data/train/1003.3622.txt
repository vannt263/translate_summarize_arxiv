    "recently there has been much interest in exact solutions of the dirac or klein - gordon equations with scalar and vector potentials of equal magnitude @xcite . by the term ` vector potential ' we mean the time component @xmath1 of the energy - momentum four - vector ; the scalar potential @xmath2 is a term added to the mass .",

    "exact solutions of dirac equation with a coulomb - like tensor potential is discussed in @xcite , under spin and pseudo - spin conditions .    for non - relativistic problems where the hamiltonian is bounded below and its discrete spectrum can be characterized variationally , the derivation of a comparison theorem of the form @xmath13 is almost immediate .",

    "can be written @xcite in natural units @xmath17 as @xmath18 @xmath19 is the mass of the particle , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the spherically symmetric vector and scalar potentials , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are dirac matrices , which satisfy anti - commutation relations ; the identity matrix is implied after the vector potential @xmath14 . for stationary states , algebraic calculations in a suitable basis lead to a pair of first - order linear differential equations in two radial functions @xmath22 , where @xmath23 for @xmath24 these functions vanish at @xmath25 , and , for bound states , they may be normalized by the relation @xmath26 we use inner products _ without _ the radial measure factor @xmath27 because the factor @xmath28 is already built in to each radial function . thus the radial functions vanish at @xmath25 and satisfy the coupled equations @xmath29 where @xmath30 @xmath31 , @xmath32 and the symbol @xmath33 represents the operator @xmath34 we note that the variable @xmath35 is sometimes written @xmath36 , as , for example in the book by messiah @xcite , and the radial functions are often written @xmath37 and @xmath38 as in the book by greiner @xcite .",
    "we shall assume that the potentials @xmath14 and @xmath15 are such that there are some discrete eigenvalues @xmath39 and that eqs.([eq3 ] ,  [ eq4 ] ) are the eigenequations for the corresponding radial eigenstates .",

    "however , we note that ( [ eq7 ] ) alone is not sufficient to derive the comparison theorem ; for this it is still necessary to use the original dirac equations .      in this case",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) become @xmath52 again , by differentiation and substitution we obtain a schrdinger equation , namely @xmath53      by using the following parametrization @xmath54 we may write the eigenequation for both cases as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is assumed to be square integrable on @xmath57 and @xmath58 is a discrete eigenvalue corresponding to a radial eigenfunction with @xmath59 nodes .      the principal result of this paper",
