    "this paper continues the rigorous study ( initiated in @xcite ) of a freely floating rigid bodies trapping time - harmonic waves in an inviscid , incompressible , heavy fluid , say water ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we consider the infinitely deep water in irrotational motion bounded from above by a free surface unbounded in all horizontal directions , but unlike the cited papers dealing with the open surface , we assume here that it is totally covered with the brash ice .",
    "the body is supposed to be an infinitely long cylinder which allows us to consider two - dimensional modes orthogonal to cylinder s generators .",
    "we also assume that the body is surface - piercing and unaffected by all external forces ( for example due to constraints on its motion ) except for gravity .",
    "the motion of the whole system is supposed to be of small amplitude near equilibrium , and so the linear model developed by john @xcite is used to describe the coupled motion of water and body .",
    "however , the free - surface boundary condition must be amended to take into account the presence of the brash ice covering the water .",
    "such a condition was proposed by peters @xcite , who considered the brash ice as an infinitely thin mat whose particles do not interact ; that is , the only forces acting on it are those due to gravity and the pressure of the water from below ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "our aim is twofold : first , we apply the so - called semi - inverse procedure for the construction of motionless two - dimensional bodies each trapping a time - harmonic mode ; that is , the water covered by the brash ice and the body oscillate at the same frequency , whereas the energy of water and ice motion is finite .",
    "we recall that a trapped mode in two and three dimensions describes a free oscillation of the system that has finite energy ( see @xcite , p.  17 ) .",
    "this should be distinguished from edge waves and waves trapped around an array of cylinders .",
    "it should be mentioned that the same semi - inverse procedure was used by kuznetsov @xcite for obtaining two - dimensional trapping bodies that are motionless in the open water ( it is outlined in  4.1 ) . however",
    ", there is an essential distinction between the case of the open water and the water covered by the brash ice .",
    "namely , no restriction was imposed on the trapping frequencies in the former case . on the contrary ,",
    "trapping frequencies are bounded by a constant characterising the brash ice and this bound is essential in the latter case .",
    "indeed , our second result shows that if a solution of the problem has finite energy and the frequency exceeds a certain bound , then this solution is trivial . generally , this bound is larger than the constant mentioned above , but these bounds may coincide for some bodies .",
    "it is essential that this result is valid for all bodies .",

    "these are the velocity potential @xmath24 and the vector column @xmath25 describing the motion of the body .",
    "this vector has the following three components :    @xmath26 @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the displacements of the centre of mass in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively from its rest position @xmath29 ;    @xmath26 @xmath30 is the angle of rotation about the axis that goes through the centre of mass orthogonally to the @xmath12-plane ( the angle is measured from the @xmath10- to the @xmath1-axis ) .    on the surface @xmath0",

    "then the governing relations for @xmath36 are as follows : @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the spatial gradient and @xmath39 is the acceleration due to gravity that acts in the direction opposite to the @xmath1-axis ; @xmath40 ( the operation @xmath41 transforms a vector row into a vector column and vice versa ) , where @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 stands for the vector product . in the equations of the body motion , the @xmath45 matrices are as follows : @xmath46 the positive elements of the mass / inertia matrix @xmath47 are @xmath48 { \\mathrm{d}\\kern0.2pt}x { \\mathrm{d}\\kern0.2pt}y , \\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the density distribution within the body and @xmath50 is the constant density of water .",

    "the boundary condition is equivalent to @xmath55 this boundary condition is of the same form as in the case of the open water when the coefficient @xmath56 stands on the right - hand side instead of @xmath57 .",
    "the parameter @xmath56 has the following expression in terms of @xmath57 : @xmath58    as in the problem describing waves on the open water , it is natural to complement the laplace equation and the boundary condition by the following radiation condition ( it means that the potential describes outgoing waves ) : @xmath59 in relations , , and , @xmath60 is a spectral parameter ( into and it is involved through @xmath57 ) , which is sought together with the eigenvector @xmath61 .",
    "since @xmath11 is a lipschitz domain and @xmath34 , it is natural to understand the problem , namely relations , and , in the sense of the integral identity @xmath62 which must hold for an arbitrary smooth @xmath63 having a compact support in @xmath64 , whereas the remaining conditions and specify the behaviour of @xmath65 at infinity .",

    "the last of these requirements yields the stability of the body equilibrium position , which is understood in the classical sense that any instantaneous infinitesimal disturbance causes the position changes which remain infinitesimal , except for purely horizontal drift , for all subsequent times .",
    "it is known ( see , for example , @xcite ) , that a potential satisfying relations , , and has the same asymptotic representation at infinity as green s function , namely @xmath70^{-1 } \\bigr ) \\ \\mbox{as } \\ x^2 + y^2 \\to \\infty .",

[ propos:1 ] let @xmath72 be a solution of problem  , then @xmath74 that is , @xmath75 .",
    "moreover , the following equality holds : @xmath76    here the kinetic energy of the water / body system stands on the left - hand side , whereas we have the potential energy of the coupled motion on the right - hand side .",
    "the latter takes into account that the water is covered by the brash ice , and so the last formula generalises the energy equipartition equality valid when a body is freely floating in the open water .",
    "proposition 1 shows that if @xmath77 is a solution with complex - valued components , then its real and imaginary parts separately satisfy the problem .",
    "this allows us to consider @xmath77 as an element of the real product space @xmath78 in what follows ; an equivalent norm in @xmath79 is defined by the sum of two quantities .",
    "let the subsidiary conditions concerning the equilibrium position ( see   2 ) hold for the freely floating body @xmath14 . a non - trivial real solution @xmath80 of the problem , and",
    "is called a _ mode trapped _ by this body , whereas the corresponding value of @xmath60 is referred to as a _ trapping frequency_.",
    "in @xcite , a semi - inverse procedure was used for the construction of motionless bodies freely floating in the open water of infinite depth and trapping a two - dimensional mode at the frequency @xmath60 given arbitrarily .",
    "the idea of the procedure is to seek bodies for a prescribed trapped mode .",
    "subsequently , this approach was developed in @xcite , where various axisymmetric trapping bodies , motionless and heaving , were constructed as well as sets of multiple bodies some of which are motionless , whereas the others heave . in this section ,",
    "we first apply the same idea to construct a family of motionless bodies trapping waves in the water covered by the brash ice and then consider the effect of the brash ice by comparing these bodies with those trapping waves in the open water .",
    "let @xmath33 be fixed so that @xmath81 satisfies the inequality @xmath82 , where the constant @xmath83 is given , thus restricting the range of admissible frequencies . in order to obtain a family of immersed parts of motionless bodies that trap waves in the water covered by the brash ice",
    "we follow the considerations used in   3 and 4 of @xcite with @xmath56 changed to @xmath84 .",
    "let us consider the following motionless mode @xmath85 , where @xmath86 denotes the zero - displacement vector , @xmath87 stands for the zero angle of rotation and @xmath88 whereas the non - dimensional velocity potential @xmath89 is as follows : @xmath90 \\ , { \\mathrm{d}\\kern0.2pt}k \\ , .",

    "these estimates yield that the kinetic and potential energy is finite for @xmath89 in every domain away from the singularities of this function .",
    "the next crucial point of the inverse procedure is to use streamlines corresponding to the velocity potential in order to define two immersed contours of a freely floating trapping body that is symmetric about the @xmath1-axis and has @xmath97 .",
    "the last property is guaranteed by a proper choice of density distribution which is always possible for a symmetric body .",
    "moreover , it is possible to choose this distribution so that @xmath98 is sufficiently close to the ordinate of the lowest points of the body , thus yielding that all of the subsidiary conditions hold .    taking a harmonic conjugate to @xmath89 in the form @xmath99 \\ , { \\mathrm{d}\\kern0.2pt}k \\ , , \\label{eq : psi0}\\ ] ]",
    "we see that this stream function decays at infinity .",
    "let us list several other properties of @xmath100 ( see their proof in @xcite , pp .",
    "178179 ) used for construction of a family of bodies trapping the mode @xmath101 . since @xmath100 is an odd function of @xmath10 , we formulate these properties only for @xmath102 .",

    "therefore , for every non - dimensional @xmath113 the streamline @xmath114 ( see the right part of figure  2 ) connects two points that lie on the positive @xmath103-axis on either side of the point @xmath115 at which @xmath100 is infinite .",
    "thus , for the chosen @xmath60 and every @xmath113 the domain @xmath7 between @xmath116 and the @xmath10-axis serves as the right immersed part of a single motionless trapping body @xmath14 obtained by connecting @xmath7 with the symmetric domain @xmath6 as shown in figure  2 for the corresponding domains in non - dimensional variables .",
    "indeed , the cauchy ",
    "riemann equations imply that @xmath117 satisfies the homogeneous neumann condition on @xmath118 , and so the coupling condition is fulfilled for the mode @xmath119 .",
    "the coupling condition is also fulfilled for this mode because it reduces to the equality @xmath120 indeed , the other two equalities are trivial by the symmetry of @xmath121 and the fact that the corresponding integrands are odd functions of @xmath10 . the proof that the last integral vanishes is based on the second green s formula and the asymptotic formulae ( see details in @xcite ) .",
    "the procedure described in  4.1 rigorously establishes the existence of trapping bodies , but it does not present pictorially the effect of the brash ice , that is , how these bodies differ from those trapping waves in the open water . in order to do this , we apply rescaling of specially chosen contours from the non - dimensional coordinates @xmath122 to @xmath123 for which purpose the equality @xmath124 serves .",
    "rescaling can be realised in two different manners  by keeping the area of the immersed part fixed and by keeping the length of @xmath125 fixed .",
    "the corresponding results are shown in figures 3 and 4 respectively , where three values of frequency are considered to demonstrate the effect ; the frequency is characterised by the product @xmath126 .    in figures 3 and 4 ( a)(c ) ,",
    "examples of symmetric bodies trapping waves in the water covered by the brash ice are shown .",
    "the bodies are represented by the boundaries of their right immersed parts ; see the left contour in each figure ( cf . figure  2 , where an example of the whole body is shown in the non - dimensional coordinates @xmath122 ) .",
    "the location of the body that traps waves in the open water at the same frequency is indicated for comparison ; it is plotted in bold ( see the contour on the right - hand side of each figure ) .",
    "both bodies have either the same area of the immersed part ( the scaling adopted in figure 3 ) or the same length of @xmath125 ( the scaling adopted in figure 4 ) .",
    "the dashed lines in figures 3 ( b ) and 4 ( b ) show the contours from which the left ones are obtained by the scaling @xmath127 .",
    "thus , figures 3 ( a)(c ) demonstrate the following properties of the obtained symmetric trapping bodies with the fixed immersed area .",
    "the spacing between two immersed parts is less for bodies that trap waves in the water covered by the brash ice than for bodies that trap waves in the open water .",
    "moreover , this spacing decreases as the frequency of trapped waves increases , whereas the length of @xmath125 , on the opposite , increases together with the frequency .",
    "the properties of symmetric trapping bodies with the fixed length of @xmath125 are as follows ; see figures 4 ( a)(c ) .",
