    "thin films of atactic polystyrene ( of thickness 10 - 100 nanometers ) , freely suspended in air , show an extraordinary depletion of their glass transition point @xcite@xcite@xcite . here",
    ", @xmath8 is derived mainly from ellipsometric measurements of the thickness @xmath9 : the low temperature expansion coefficient is smaller than the high temperature coefficient , and they define on the plot @xmath9 two tangents which intersect at one temperature @xmath10 it is assumed that the glass transition point of the film coincides with @xmath11    the depletion of @xmath8 occurs mainly for high molecular weights ( above 500 k ) but saturates at extremely high weights ( above 2 000 k ) .",
    "the thicknesses involved are comparable to the coil size : this induced us to propose that  melting  can occur via two competing scenarios : the first scenario corresponds to the standard bulk transition , related to the freezing - unfreezing of certain local degrees of freedom .",
    "the second scenario involves sliding motions of each polymer chain along its own path @xcite .  in the bulk , this sliding is blocked at the end points .",
    "but , near a free surface , we expect that a thin  skin  ( of thickness @xmath12 1 nanometer ) is fluid , and that the chain arcs which touch this skin at two points a , b , may be fluidized in between .",
    "the fluidity which is described here is _ not complete _ : each chain is still trapped between its two ends .",
    "this agrees with the observation that films below the bulk glass transition point @xmath13 , but above the measured ",
    "transition point ",
    "@xmath14 , can be kept permanently while films at @xmath15 generate holes which grow indefinitely ( to decrease the surface energy ) .",
    "the sliding model leads naturally to some of the observed features @xcite .",
    "but it is not complete  a ) the nature of the sliding motion is unclear : in its simplest version , it would be a simultaneous cooperative motion of all monomers along a long arc ab , and this is unrealistic  b ) the drops in @xmath8 were expected to be very large also for relatively short chains ( m@xmath16 ) while , in fact , they are found to be weak in this limit .    in the present note",
    ", we return to two questions :  a ) in section 2 , we present a modified set of equations describing the onset of sliding which does not require a cooperative motion of all the arc  b ) we argue that the characteristic temperature @xmath14 , derived from the experiments by the construction of fig .",
    "1 , need not be the actual transition point @xmath17 ( fig .",
    "as in ref . [ 4 ] , we consider an arc , or piece of chain , containing @xmath18 monomers between its conntact points with the surface .",
    "we want that a defect ( or  kink  ) be able to move all along this arc .",
    "the defect motions will require certain cavity volumes @xmath19 for its successive steps .",
    "the jump rates 1/@xmath20 are taken of the form :    @xmath21    where v@xmath22 is the free volume , and is written in the simplified form :    @xmath23    ( @xmath24 is the volger fulcher temperature ) .",
    "( note that in eqs  ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , the volumes @xmath25 and v are measured in units of the monomer volume @xmath26 ) .",
    "we now impose that all the jump rates 1/@xmath20 along the arc , be further than a certain rate 1/@xmath27 ( defined by our measuring set up ) .  for the bulk systems ,",
    "the cavity volume is of order @xmath26 , and the jump rates are of the form :    @xmath28    the bulk glass temperature @xmath13 corresponds to @xmath29 and thus to :    @xmath30    where :    @xmath31    the cavity volumes @xmath25 required for the _ sliding _ motion are somewhat smaller .",
    "they are distributed according to a certain stochastic law @xmath32 ) . if the jump at laws ( i ) is further than 1/@xmath27 , we see from eq .",
    "( 1 ) that we must have :    @xmath33    or , equivalently :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is a reduced temperature :    @xmath36    the possibility of a fast jump rate ( @xmath37/@xmath38 ) at site @xmath39 , is thus , from eq . 7 :",
    "@xmath40    the probability of a fast rate for _ all _ the @xmath18 sites is ( assuming independence ) :    @xmath41    ( where we have anticipated the fact that @xmath42 is small in the region of interest ) .    from eq .",
    "( 10 ) , we see that our arc is mobile if @xmath43 is smaller than unity , and is stuck if @xmath44 .",
    "the mobility threshold corresponds to :    @xmath45    ( note that @xmath46 , and @xmath42(@xmath47 as announced ) .",
    "the size of the arc is related to the depth @xmath48 which it reaches from the free surface . since our chains are ideal random walks , we can put @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is again a monomer size .",
    "we thus arrive at the basic formula for the depth of the soft layer @xmath48 as a function of the reduced temperature @xmath51    @xmath52    ( this holds whenever @xmath48 is smaller than the coil radius @xmath53    we shall now make this more concrete by choosing the most natural form for @xmath54 -i.e . a gaussian tail .  from its definition ( eq .",
    "9 ) , we see that @xmath55 and @xmath56we then postulate the following form :    @xmath57    the width of the distribution of the cavity volumes @xmath25 is then proportional to @xmath58 .",
    "we expect @xmath58 to be somewhat smaller than unity , because sliding motions are easier than bulk motions .",
    "typically , we shall require @xmath59  returning to eq.(2 ) , we see that :    @xmath60    the main point of interest is the cross over  from the  sandwich regime  of fig .  2 to the single layer regime .",
    "this occurs when @xmath48 is half the thickness of the film @xmath61 the corresponding reduced temperature is :    @xmath62    ( to use eq .",
    "15 we must satisfy the condition @xmath2 because the mobile layers can not be larger than the coil size @xmath3)@xmath63      the maximum allowed value for the arc length @xmath18 is the total length @xmath64 ( in monomer units ) .  from eq .",
    "( 10 ) , we see that the probability of internal mobility for the whole chain is @xmath65 ) .",
    "let us sit at the bulk glass temperature ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "if @xmath64 is too large , the sliding process becomes non competitive ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "and if it is not competitive at @xmath68 , it will be even less so at lower temperatures ( lower @xmath69 ) , where @xmath70 .",
    "thus , we conclude that there is a maximum length :    @xmath71    and a maximum depth @xmath72 . thus the model does lead to a saturation of high molecular weights .",
    "we do not need very small @xmath58 values to reach very high @xmath0 values .",
    "typically , we might choose @xmath73 , leading to @xmath0 of order 1.7 x 10@xmath74  these moderate values of @xmath58 mean that the sliding process can be important , even if it is not much easier than the bulk process .",
    "a central feature is the temperature @xmath17 at which a film switches from the sandwich structure to the globally semi fluid structure ( fig .",
    "2 ) .  a qualitative plot of @xmath17 , deduced from eq . ( 15 ) , is shown on fig .",
    "3 . for very long chains ( @xmath75 )",
    "the whole curve is meaningful .  for shorter chains ( @xmath76 )",
    "the curve is valid only up to @xmath77 : when @xmath78 , we have a sandwich structure at all temperatures below @xmath79    of course , the cut off at @xmath80 is not sharp : even for @xmath81 ( for instance ) there are still some chains linking the two sides .",
    "but , because of the gaussian statistics of the chain conformations , the cut off is still reasonably sharp , and meaningful .    how does the temperature @xmath17 relate to the experiments",
    "initially , we thought that the  accident  in the expansion plot of fig . 1 was the signature of @xmath17 .  on second thoughts , however , this needs not to be true , as explained on fig .",
    "2 . the intersection scheme used to define an accident may lead to another temperature , which we call @xmath14 .",
    "we analyse @xmath14 in the next section .",
    "we choose a film of thickness @xmath83 , and also impose @xmath2 , so that the sandwich transition point @xmath14 is meaningful .",
    "our discussion is centered on fig .  2 .",
    "we are dealing with these states of polymer matter :    - the melt , with an expansion coefficient @xmath84    - the glass , with a smaller expansion coefficient @xmath85    - the semi fluid state with mobile arcs , for which we postulate a third expansion coefficient @xmath86 .",
    "this is clearly an extreme simplification : a semi fluid layer , in the sandwich state , is really a _ brush _ of flexible polymers rooted in the glassy sublayer : it is strongly anisotropic and this complicate the picture .",
    "but the description , in terms of one single , constant , coefficient @xmath86 , is a natural starting point .    in the present picture , the slopes @xmath87 @xmath88 ( or preferably in reduced units @xmath87 @xmath89 ) are constant for the melt and for a globally semi fluid state .",
    "but the sandwich state is more delicate .",
    "the local slope here is of the form :    @xmath90    in eq . (",
    "7 ) the first two terms represent a weighted expansion for a film with two semi fluid layers of thickness @xmath91 defined by eq .",
    "the last term is novel .",
    "it involves the spontaneous thicknesses ( @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) of a film which is glassy ( @xmath92 ) or semi fluid ( @xmath94 ) at the temperature of interest : when @xmath95 , if the boundary between a dense phase and a less dense phase moves , the overall thickness changes .",
    "of course , the parameters @xmath92 and @xmath96 are related to the dilation coefficients @xmath97 ,  @xmath98 .",
    "but the difference @xmath99 at one chosen temperature ( here at @xmath100 ) is another independent parameter .",
    "the sign of @xmath101 is clear : the semi fluid phase should be more expandable upon heating than the glass phase , and @xmath102 . but the sign of @xmath103 is less clear , and might depend on subtle properties of the semi fluid brushes .",
    "in the following discussion , we shall make two further assumptions :    \\(i ) @xmath104 .",
    "this is equivalent to say that , on the plot of fig .  2 , the slope of thickness versus temperature _ increases _ when we cross @xmath17 , switching from the sandwich to the single layer regime .",
    "\\(ii ) we also assume ( for simplicity ) that @xmath105 is temperature independent in the region of interest .",
    "the temperature regions of interest are shown on fig . 2 :    \\a ) in the single layer regime",
    ", the thickness varies linearly between a lower limit @xmath106 ( corresponding to the sandwich transition ) and an upper limit @xmath107 ( corresponding to the bulk glass transition point ) .",
    "thus , the difference @xmath108 is given by :    @xmath109    \\b ) in the sandwich regime , eq .",
    "( 17 ) holds , and the thickness progressively increases from the glassy limit ( @xmath110 ) up to the transition value @xmath106 ( at @xmath100 , where @xmath111 is defined in eq .",
    "15 ) . of particular interest is the slope of @xmath112 , just below the transition point , which is derived from eq .",
    "( 17 ) :    @xmath113    @xmath114    where we have used eq .",
    "( 15 ) for @xmath115 and defined a dimensionlessparameter :    @xmath116    let us now define an _",
    "_ apparent__@xmath117transition temperature @xmath118 ( in reduced units ) by the following construction ( displayed on fig .",
    "2 ) :    \\(i ) we extrapolate the slope @xmath119 at @xmath120    \\(ii ) we extrapolate the fluid slope @xmath121 at @xmath122    the intersection of these two tangents lies at @xmath123 and @xmath124 algebraically , this corresponds to :    @xmath125    @xmath126    eliminating @xmath127 between ( 22 ) and ( 23 ) , we arrive at :    @xmath128    the resulting relation between @xmath115 and @xmath129 is shown on fig . 4 :    \\a ) if @xmath130  @xmath129 is closed to unity and much larger than @xmath115 ( except near @xmath66 ) . here",
    ", the distinction between apparent and real transitions could be significant .",
    "\\b ) if @xmath131  @xmath129 is close to @xmath115 ( except near @xmath132 ) .",
    "\\1 ) the present version of the sliding model does contain some improvements ,",

    "@xmath134 give ( by eq.16 ) a limiting degree of polymerisation @xmath0 which is very high ( @xmath135 ) and comparable to what is observed .",
    "\\2 ) we now also realise that the apparent glass temperatures @xmath14 derived from the thickness / temperature plots may differ from the actual transition point @xmath17 ( where the system switches from  sandwich  to  globally semi fluid ) .",
    "section 3 describes one particular model for this effect , and is only indicative .",
    "but the effect may be quite general .",
    "\\3 ) the modified version does _ not _ solve one major problem : why do the drops in @xmath8 fade out for molecular weights smaller than @xmath136 @xmath137 ? incorporating the difference between @xmath14 and @xmath17 does not seem to help us here .    _",
