    "as the number of agn surveyed by _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ increases , it is becoming apparent that the vast majority show evidence for a narrow ( unresolved by _ xmm _ )",
    "line at @xmath1  6.4  kev , due to emission from neutral iron ; recent papers describing such lines include gondoin ( 2003 ; ngc  3227 ) , page ( 2003 ; mrk  896 ) , pounds ( 2003 ; mrk  766 ) , petrucci ( 2002 ; mrk  841 ) , turner ( 2002 ; ngc  3516 ) , obrien ( 2001 ; mrk  359 ) , reeves ( 2001 ; mrk  205 ) and many others . in a number of cases ( e.g. , ngc  3783  kaspi 2002 ; ngc  5548  yaqoob 2001 ) the lines",
    "have actually been resolved by _",
    ", with fwhm velocities typically @xmath5  5000  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "iron k@xmath0 emission was first identified as a common feature by _ ginga _ ( pounds 1990 ; nandra & pounds 1994 ) ; observations by _ asca _ tended to find relatively broad profiles , although re - analysis of some of the data indicates that the lines _ may _ be narrower than originally measured ( lubinski & zdziarski 2001 ) .",
    "there is some disagreement over these results , however , with yaqoob ( 2002 ) stating that the _ asca _ calibration changes have a negligible effect on the line profiles .",
    "very few broad lines have been found in _ xmm _",
    "data to date , examples being mcg  @xmath76@xmath730@xmath715 ( fabian 2002 ) , mrk  205 ( reeves 2001 ) and mrk  509 ( pounds 2001 ) . however , not all these line profiles are the same , with mcg  @xmath76@xmath730@xmath715 showing a strongly asymmetric line , presumably due to the strong gravitational forces and high velocity in the inner accretion disc .",
    "mrk  205 , however , is only well - fitted by a relativistic disc - line model if the disc is strongly ionised , since the broad emission peaks at @xmath1  6.7  kev .",
    "this is not the only conceivable explanation , as reeves ( 2001 ) discuss : the emission could come from a spherical distribution of clouds , rather than the planar accretion disc ; alternatively , the broad line may actually consist of a blend of different ionisation narrow lines . the broad line in mrk  509",
    "is also apparently ionised .",
    "the narrow emission lines observed by _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ are interpreted as fe  k fluorescence from cold ( neutral ) matter far from the inner accretion disc .",
    "suggestions for the origin of the narrow line include the putative molecular torus , the broad line region ( blr ) or the very outer - most reaches of the accretion disc .",
    "the baldwin effect is well known for optical / uv emission lines , with baldwin ( 1977 ) first reporting that the ew of the c  iv ( @xmath8  =  1549   ) line decreased with increasing uv luminosity . since then , significant anti - correlations have been found between the luminosity and various other ions , such as n  v , he  ii , c  iii ] , mg  ii and ly@xmath0 ( e.g. , tytler & fan 1992 ; zamorani 1992 ; green , forster & kuraszkiewicz 2001 ; dietrich 2002 ) , although the strengths of these correlations are still unclear .",
    "it should be noted that , although the baldwin effect is generally accepted to be an anti - correlation between equivalent width and luminosity , green ( 2001 ) claim that ew is actually more strongly correlated with redshift than luminosity for their data .",
    "however , croom ( 2002 ) find that , for 12 of the 14 lines tested , the stronger correlation is with absolute magnitude rather than redshift .",
    "iwasawa & taniguchi ( 1993 ) reported an x - ray baldwin effect in the fe  k lines found in _",
    "ginga _ observations of agn .",
    "they find a strong relationship for their seyfert sample , but were unable to conclude that it holds for qsos , due to poor constraints ; there is also a baldwin effect for the broad iron lines found in _",
    "asca _ data ( nandra 1997 ) .",
    "such broad lines are thought to be produced through fluorescence of the accretion disc itself .",
    "nandra suggest , based on an earlier paper ( nandra 1995 ) , that this baldwin effect is due to the presence of an ionised skin on the accretion disc , with the degree of ionisation increasing with luminosity ; see also nayakshin ( 2000a , b ) .",
    "nandra ( 1997 ) also find that the narrow line core drops in intensity as the luminosity increases , but conclude that the entire baldwin effect in their data can be attributed to the broader line alone .    in this paper",
    "we show , and attempt to explain , a baldwin effect for the narrow fe  k@xmath0 lines measured in _ xmm _ data , for a sample including both seyfert galaxies and qsos .",
    "this sample consists of 53 type i agn ( table  [ objects ] ) , these being mainly a combination of our own proprietary targets and public observations obtained from the online _",
    "xmm _ science archive .",
    "a literature search also revealed four more objects for which the relevant data had been published ( ngc  5506  matt 2001 ; ngc  3516  turner 2002 ; 1h  0707@xmath7495  boller 2002 ; ton  s180  vaughan 2002 and vaughan 2003 , private communication ) .",
    ".the type i agn included in this sample , ordered by redshift within the radio - quiet and radio - loud groups .",
    "the luminosities were calculated for the 210  kev rest frame and 90  per  cent errors / upper limits are given for the rest - frame equivalent widths .",
    "@xmath9 narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies ; @xmath10 broad line seyfert 1 galaxies ; @xmath11 qsos [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     figure  [ ew - lum ] plots the rest - frame ew against the de - reddened 210  kev luminosity .",
    "it can clearly be seen that there is a decrease in the ew as the luminosity increases  the ` x - ray baldwin effect ' .",
    "the asurv ( astronomy survival analysis ; feigelson & nelson 1985 ) package can be used in the presence of censored ( upper limit ) data .",
    "this allows the spearman rank ( sr ) statistic to be applied to the complete dataset , and gives an anti - correlation between the ew and luminosity of @xmath4  99.98  per  cent ( @xmath1  98.5  per  cent if the upper limits are dropped ) .",
    "due to selection effects , luminosity and redshift are very strongly correlated , as shown in figure  [ lum - z ] .",
    "hence , it is often difficult to determine whether the correlation in question is with luminosity or redshift . using the simple spearman rank , a weaker correlation ( 99  per  cent ; 79.5  per  cent if the upper limits are excluded ) was found between the line strength and the redshift .",
    "an alternative method for checking involves the partial spearman rank , which gives an indication as to which of the two relationships is stronger . in this case , agreeing with the simple spearman rank , the ew - luminosity correlation appears to be the dominant relationship .",
    "weighted linear regression can be used to find the slope of the best - fit line to the log - log plot of ew against luminosity  that is , the power - law fit .",
    "this was performed using two different methods .",
    "firstly the upper limit measurements were completely removed ; this gave a value of @xmath70.17  @xmath12  0.08 .",
    "the second method used the linear regression option within asurv ; although upper limit values are accounted for , this method does not include the errors on the actual measurements . using this method",
    ", the slope is very similar , with a value of @xmath70.18  @xmath12  0.04 .    as a further check to determine whether the baldwin effect could be due to evolution",
    ", the objects at higher redshifts were progressively removed from the sample .",
    "it was found , however , that even considering only those agn at z  @xmath5  0.1 , there still remained an inverse correlation between ew and luminosity which was consistent in magnitude ( slope of 0.15  @xmath12  0.08 using asurv ) with that found for the complete sample .",
    "this implies that the decrease in line strength is predominantly a luminosity - dependent effect .",
    "there is a possible complication in that the highest luminosity agn tend to be radio - loud , since the average x - ray emission from radio - quiet agn is about three times lower than that from radio - loud objects ( zamorani 1981 ; worrall 1987 ) .",
    "the underlying worry , therefore , is that the ew is very low at the highest luminosities because of dilution through beaming effects .",
    "however , as fig .",
    "[ ew - lum ] shows , there are lower - luminosity radio - loud agn in this sample which have correspondingly higher ews .",
    "conversely , pb  5062 and pg  1634 + 706  radio - quiet agn  at luminosities of @xmath1  10@xmath13  erg  s@xmath6 have low upper limits of ew  @xmath5  63  ev for their lines .",
    "hence , the anti - correlation observed is not simply due to beaming . to show the overall effect more clearly , figure  [ bins ]",
    "was plotted .",
    "this shows the mean ew for a number of luminosity bins considering all the objects ( top plot ) and just the radio - quiet ones ( bottom ) . in both plots ,",
    "the decrease in ew is obvious . to produce figure  [ bins ] , upper limits were taken to be half of the value , together with an equally sized error bar ; a similar decrease in ew is also observed if the upper limits are dropped , although the luminosity range covered is lower .    figure  [ ew - gamma ] plots the ew against the power - law slope measured over the 210  kev rest - frame energy band . since flatter slopes are often taken to be indicative of reflection , it might be expected that they would correspond to stronger emission lines ( since the fluorescence line may come about through reflection processes ) , although the 210  kev band is not very sensitive to reflection components . however , this is clearly not the case ; if anything , there is a slight trend in the opposite direction , with some of the steeper slopes showing the highest ews .",
    "suggestions for the origin of the neutral fe  k@xmath0 line include the putative molecular torus and the blr ; these theories will be investigated in the following sections , considering both the feasibility of the line production and possible explanations for the x - ray baldwin effect .",
    "yaqoob ( 2001 ) give the following equation for the ew of the narrow line in agn , for low optical depths :    @xmath14    @xmath15    where e@xmath16 is the energy of fe k edge ( 7.11  kev for neutral iron ) and e@xmath17 the central energy of the line , both in units of kev .",
    "f@xmath18 is the fraction of the sky covered by blr clouds ; a@xmath19 , the abundance of iron relative to hydrogen , where 4.68  @xmath20  10@xmath21 is the solar value ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) ; n@xmath22 , the column density of the clouds in @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the fluorescence yield (=  0.34 for neutral fe ) .    based on a particular blr model",
    ", yaqoob find that the strength of the fe  k@xmath0 line in ngc  5548 is likely to be too large to come simply from the blr ; the predicted ew is 36  ev , whereas the measured value is almost four times larger , at 133  ev .",
    "they suggest that these differences could be explained by a decline in the continuum level shortly before the observation ; in this event , the line would not have had time to respond to the smaller continuum level and , so , would appear unusually strong .    whatever the explantion for ngc  5548 , if the blr origin is correct , the reason why most of the objects in table  [ objects ] have relatively high ew values compared to those predicted by the above equation must be explained .",
    "it must also be determined whether a variation in the parameters could explain the observed ew - luminosity correlation .",
    "the iron k line is produced by a different physical process ( fluoresence ) from the optical / uv emission lines ( photoionisation ) .",
    "nevertheless , changes in covering factor or abundance , for example , might be reflected in the blr optical / uv lines , so it is briefly examined whether such correlations exist .",
    "one possibility is that the covering fraction of the blr clouds is systematically underestimated in the above formula and decreases with increasing luminosity .",
    "there is no independent evidence for very high blr covering factors , however , and the observed ew of optical / uv lines can be reproduced using modest values ( few 10s of percent ) . for the agn sample used here",
    ", no correlation is found between the ew of the narrow iron line and those of civ @xmath81549 and ly@xmath0 ( values taken from wang , lu & zhou 1998 and constantin & shields 2003 ) .",
    "likewise , no correlation is found with the h@xmath25/civ ratio , which can be used as a ionisation diagnostic , or with the h@xmath25 fwhm ( obtained from dewangan 2002 ; kaspi 2000 ) or ew ( marziani 2003 ; v ' eron - cetty , v ' eron & gonalves 2001 ) ; this is shown in figure  [ hbetafwhm ] .",
    "h@xmath25 line fluxes for the h@xmath25/civ ratio were taken from marziani ( 2003 ) , cruz - gonz ' alez ( 1994 ) and mulchaey ( 1994 ) .    comparing the slope of",
    "the baldwin relation is problematic , as different optical / uv lines show different slopes .",
    "for example , using the same cosmology as in this paper , croom ( 2002 ) find a correlation for the civ line , produced in the blr , of ew  @xmath2  l@xmath26 .",
    "they also find ew  @xmath2  l@xmath27 for the ciii ] blend ( ciii ] , aliii and siiii ] ) .",
    "dietrich ( 2002 ) give a list of baldwin effect slopes for different emission lines , varying between @xmath1  @xmath70.24 and + 0.02 , for h@xmath28  =  65  km  s@xmath6",
    "mpc@xmath6 and @xmath29  =  0 .",
    "they mention that including a cosmological constant of 0.7 changes the luminosities by @xmath5  20  per  cent .",
    "green et al . ( 2001 ) find a similar range , using h@xmath28  =  50  km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6 and @xmath29  =  0 .",
    "the overall impression in the optical / uv is of a correlation between the slope of the baldwin relation and the ionisation potential , suggesting a change in the average continuum shape with luminosity or redshift ( depending which dominates the correlation found in a particular study ) .",
    "it is possible that the x - ray baldwin effect found here is produced by a corresponding variation in the shape of the continuum illuminating the fluorescing material , although one might expect then to see some correlations with the observed optical / uv lines .    the range of luminosities of the agn in this sample over - laps with those investigated by dietrich ( 2002 ) .",
    "upon comparison of all the objects with those with log@xmath8l@xmath30(1450 )  @xmath4  44 , they find little change in the slope of the baldwin relation for the different ranges , so the fact that qsos tend to have larger l@xmath31/l@xmath32 ratios than seyfert galaxies is not likely to be an important factor .",
    "alternatively it could be argued that the iron abundance has been underestimated and varies with luminosity .",
    "predicting the trend of metallicity in agn is complicated since their evolutionary history is not known sufficiently well .",
    "blr metallicities appear to be near - solar , but comparison of blr observations with detailed photoionisation models suggest that blr metallicity does increase with luminosity ( e.g. , hamann & ferland 1993 ; shemmer & netzer 2002 ) .",
    "this is oppposite to the trend expected if the x - ray baldwin effect is to be explained by an abundance effect . deriving the iron abundance from optical line ratios",
    "is made difficult due to the thermostatic effect of fe  ii ( which is a major coolant ) .",
    "for the present sample , there is no correlation between the strength of the x - ray fe  k@xmath0 line and the optical fe  ii feature at @xmath84590 ( figure  [ feii ] ; fe  ii ews from marziani 2003 ) .",
    "the predicted ew is linearly dependent on column density in the above equation , but yaqoob et al .",
    "( 2001 ) note that the approximations are only valid for n@xmath22  @xmath5  5.6  @xmath20  10@xmath33  @xmath23 ( i.e. assuming an fe k absorption optical depth much less than unity ) . although some blr models suggest higher column densities ( e.g. , radovich & rafanelli 1994 ; recondo - gonzalez 1997 ) , values @xmath34 @xmath23 are thought ` normal ' .",
    "typical blr velocities are of the order 5000 km  s@xmath6 , which is resolvable by _",
    "chandra_. to date , the velocity width of the narrow iron line has only been measured a few times , and the results are not entirely consistent .",
    "kaspi ( 2002 ) resolved the line profile of ngc  3783 with the _ chandra _ high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) , finding a fwhm velocity of @xmath1  1700  km  s@xmath6 , which is low for a blr but consistent with originating in the inner part of the torus .",
    "likewise , ogle ( 2000 ) obtain a fwhm value of 1800  @xmath12  200  km  s@xmath6 for the narrow fe  k@xmath0 line detected in ngc  4151 .",
    "the width of the iron lines in mcg@xmath76@xmath730@xmath715 have also been measured with the hetgs .",
    "the situation is complicated by the presence of the various different components of the line in this object , both resolved and unresolved , narrow and broad .",
    "however , lee ( 2002 ) obtain a width of 11 000@xmath35  km  s@xmath6 for the resolved narrow component when considering the full observation ; this drops to 3600@xmath36  km  s@xmath6 for the ` high ' flux state . within the errors , these measurements are consistent with a fwhm of @xmath1  6000  km  s@xmath6 , which would indicate that the line is not formed in the torus .",
    "yaqoob ( 2001 ) measure a fwhm of @xmath1  4500  km  s@xmath6 for ngc  5548 , which also supports an origin in the blr .",
    "it should be noted that , although the measurements are all broadly consistent , and indicate an origin in either the outer blr or torus , there are relatively few grating measurements of the line , so it is unclear how narrow the line core truly is .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the ` narrow ' lines may actually be formed in the accretion disc itself .",
    "nayakshin ( 2000a , b ) discusses how a baldwin effect could be produced by the ionisation of the skin of the disc , as the luminosity increases . a recent paper by yaqoob et al .",
    "( 2003 ) suggests that such narrow lines may come from a disc which is viewed face - on and has a flat emissivity profile .",
    "similar suggestions have been made for optical / uv blr lines .",
    "however , as mentioned above , no correlation is found here between the narrow iron line ew and the h@xmath25 parameters . there is a difference between the blrs found in narrow line and broad line seyfert galaxies ",
    "the nls1s show much narrower emission lines , hence their name .",
    "it has been previously noted that nls1s tend to show weaker h@xmath25 emission ( e.g. , gaskell 1985 ) and this was confirmed upon comparing the h@xmath25 ew of samples of nls1s and bls1s ( taken from marziani 2003 ) ",
    "student s t - test gave a very low probability of the two groups originating in the same population , with the nls1s having a much lower mean ew .",
    "considering the few objects in the present sample , this difference in line strengths is also found .",
    "when comparing the fe  k@xmath0 ews , however , there is no appreciable difference between the narrow- and broad - line samples , shown both by the t - test and asurv ( to account for the upper limits )",
    ".    possible support for the accretion disc origin lies in the variability of the narrow line in mrk  841 ( petrucci 2002 ) .",
    "they find that the line varied between two observations separated by 15 hours , although , within the errors , the change in line flux is not large .",
    "such a rapid variation is hard to explain if the line is formed in distant reprocessing matter , indicating its origin might be closer to the central engine ; the line width is only constrained to be @xmath5  170  ev . to date , mrk  841 is the only object in which this variation has been observed .",
    "overall , while the blr remains a possible source for some of the narrow iron emission , we are unable to explain how the blr alone could produce the strongest observed narrow lines nor why the baldwin relation should exist . in particular , it is unclear why the most luminous objects should have fairly normal blrs compared to the lower - luminosity objects , as judged from their optical / uv blr lines , yet have no detectable narrow 6.4 kev iron line .",
    "krolik , madau & .",
    "zycki ( 1994 ) discuss the production of the iron k@xmath0 line in the torus .",
    "they compute that for a thomson optical depth , @xmath37 , of 0.51 , the ew of the line should be of the order 100  ev , assuming an unobscured view ; for @xmath37  =  2 , this value approximately halves , to 55  ev .",
    "they also find a small decrease in ew for increasing opening angle of the torus .",
    "the value of @xmath1  100  ev , for a low optical depth , is , as they point out , in broad agreement with the ew measured in many seyfert 1 galaxies , suggesting that the fe  k@xmath0 emission line could be due solely to reflection / fluorescence from the torus and not linked to the accretion disc or blr at all .",
    "ghisellini , haardt & matt ( 1994 ) also mention that the torus could produce an emission line of ew  @xmath1  90  ev , if the column density is @xmath38  10@xmath39  @xmath23 .",
    "it should be noted that both of these papers used a value of 3.31  @xmath20  10@xmath21 for the solar abundance of iron , rather than the 4.68  @xmath20  10@xmath21 assumed by yaqoob ( 2000 ) . assuming the ew scales linearly with the abundance , the values from krolik ( 1994 ) and ghisellini ( 1994 ) should be scaled to @xmath1  141 or @xmath1  127  ev , respectively , to compare to yaqoob s result .    as mentioned earlier",
    ", the presence of a neutral reflection component would indicate the existence of cool , compton thick material ( guilbert & rees 1988 ; lightman & white 1988 ; george & fabian 1991 ) , such as the torus .",
    "some of the spectra here show evidence for such reflection , although the values are generally poorly constrained .",
    "this is not entirely surprising though , since most of the objects are at fairly low redshift , meaning that the rest frame bands covered by _ xmm _ do not extend much above @xmath1  10  kev , while the compton reflection hump is expected to peak around 3050  kev ; reflection components may not be detected in the present data , but that is not to say that they do not exist .",
    "_ if _ , however , reflection components are not found in the spectra , this does not necessarily rule out the torus as the origin of the narrow line . instead",
    ", the material of the torus could be compton thin ; if this were the case , no strong reflection component would be expected .",
    "matt , guainazzi & maiolino ( 2003 ) show that , for a compton thin torus with n@xmath22  =  2  @xmath20  10@xmath33  @xmath23 , a fluorescent iron line with ew  @xmath1  80  ev can be formed .",
    "this is , therefore , a further possibility for production of the narrow line .",
    "knigl & kartje ( 1994 ) discuss a dusty disc - driven hydromagnetic wind model for the torus , finding that , if l@xmath40  @xmath38  1.5  @xmath20  10@xmath41(m/10@xmath42 )  erg  s@xmath6 , where l@xmath40 is the 2100  @xmath43 m infrared luminosity , then the radiation pressure force could be expected to flatten the dust distribution ; this causes the opening angle of the torus to increase , leading to a reduction in the covering factor .",
    "this relates to krolik ( 1994 ) , who found that the ew of the fe k@xmath0 line decreases slightly with increasing opening angle . in this way ,",
    "an increase in luminosity and subsequent decrease in covering factor could lead to a smaller ew .",
    "this result is similar to work done by mushotzky & ferland ( 1984 ) , who proposed a luminosity - dependent ionisation parameter and , hence , covering factor to explain the original baldwin effect .",
    "an alternative explanation , suggested by ohsuga & umemura ( 2001 ) , is that relatively low - luminosity agn are more likely to contain dusty walls of gas , supported by radiation pressure from a circumnuclear starburst ; the stronger radiation pressure from the more luminous agn may prevent these from forming .",
    "if the x - ray baldwin effect is , indeed , caused by a decrease in the covering factor of the torus , then this has implications for the number of type-2 qsos .",
    "many seyfert 2 galaxies are known , but very few obscured qsos have yet been discovered ( e.g. , derry 2003 and references therein ) .",
    "a luminosity - dependent drop in the covering factor provides goes some way towards explaining the lack of high luminosity obscured sources , although obscuration should still arise due to mergers and the birth of the qsos .",
    "there is an apparent x - ray baldwin effect for the narrow , neutral iron line observed in many agn : as the 210 kev rest frame luminosity increases , the equivalent width of the line drops .",
    "the reason for this correlation is uncertain , but one possibility is a decline in the covering factor of the putative molecular torus as the luminosity increases .",
    "this decrease in covering fraction could be due to increased radiation pressure flattening the torus , leading to an increased opening angle and , hence , smaller covering factor . although the blr remains a possibility for the origin of some of the narrow line , it is difficult to explain how the strongest lines could be formed , or what it is that leads to the baldwin effect .",
    "the negative correlation between ew of the line and the luminosity of the object is not solely due to a dilution effect by beaming in the radio - loud sources , since the effect is also observed in the radio - quiet objects alone .    given the resolution of epic and the _ chandra _ hetgs , it is not currently possible to rule out the origin of the line being either the blr clouds or reflection off distant matter ( i.e. , the torus ) .",
    "future observations with calorimeter - based x - ray detectors ( such as the x - ray spectrometer on - board _ astro - e2 _ , or _ xeus _ ) will provide sufficient spectral resolution , of the order a few hundred km  s@xmath6 , to be able to resolve this issue .",
    "the work in this paper is based on observations with _ xmm - newton _ , an esa science mission , with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa and nasa .",
    "the authors would like to thank the epic consortium for all their work during the calibration phase , and the soc and ssc teams for making the observation and analysis possible .",
