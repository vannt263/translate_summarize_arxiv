    "the majority of matter in the solar system is subject to pressures above 10 gpa,@xcite which motivates studies of materials such as oxides at high pressures . in the case of @xmath2 compounds , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are , respectively , a divalent cation and halogen atom or a tetravalent cation and oxygen atom , the general effect of increasing the pressure is to distort the anion polyhedra and eventually to increase the coordination number ( cn).@xcite the highest cn observed in metal dioxides is in the pbcl@xmath0-type cotunnite structure with cn=9 .",
    "metal dioxides with large cation radii often form cotunnite phases at high pressures , such as tio@xmath0 , zro@xmath0 , hfo@xmath0 , ceo@xmath0 , pbo@xmath0 , puo@xmath0 , uo@xmath0 , tbo@xmath0 , teo@xmath0,@xcite and tho@xmath0.@xcite the very important oxide sio@xmath0 is predicted to adopt the cotunnite structure above 690 gpa , which may be relevant to the study of extrasolar planets.@xcite the hardest known oxide is the cotunnite structure of tio@xmath0 , which has been synthesised at high pressures and recovered to ambient conditions.@xcite    materials that adopt the cotunnite structure are expected to transform under additional applied pressure into post - cotunnite structures with an accompanying increase in cn to 10 or more , as reported for some dihalides.@xcite in reviewing the high pressure phases of dioxides our attention was drawn to teo@xmath0 which , to the best of our knowledge , is the only dioxide for which a transition to a post - cotunnite phase has been observed.@xcite sato _ _ et al.__@xcite studied teo@xmath0 up to pressures of 150 gpa in a diamond anvil cell .",
    "x - ray diffraction data showed strong evidence for a structural phase transition around 80 - 100 gpa , but the quality of the data was insufficient to allow a determination of the structure of the new phase , although the known post - cotunnite structures of dihalides were eliminated.@xcite identifying the post - cotunnite structure of teo@xmath0 would further our understanding of dioxides at high pressures .",
    "teo@xmath0 is also an interesting material from the point of view of fundamental science and technology.@xcite it has shown promise as a material for nonlinear optical devices , usually in a glassy form but potentially from nanosize crystals.@xcite",
    "first - principles or _ ab initio _ ( ai ) density - functional - theory ( dft ) methods have been widely applied to materials at high pressures , and have provided both confirmation of experimental results and predictions of new phases and their properties .",
    "dft calculations have given very accurate descriptions of the high - pressure phases of @xmath5 bonded materials.@xcite we have studied high - pressure phases of teo@xmath0 using ai dft methods combined with `` random structure searching '' ( the airss approach).@xcite this approach has been used to predict high pressure phases which have subsequently been found experimentally,@xcite and to predict new high - pressure phases of materials such as hydrogen@xcite and ammonia.@xcite    the recipe for a random search commences by generating a set of initial structures , for each of which a random unit cell is created and renormalised to a reasonable volume , and the desired number of each atomic species is randomly distributed throughout . each of these initial configurations is relaxed to a minimum in the enthalpy at a predefined pressure , and the procedure repeated until the lowest enthalpy structures have been found several times .",
    "such random searching is largely unbiased , but it can often be made much more efficient by applying constraints .",
    "any reasonable structure of teo@xmath0 will contain only te - o bonds , and therefore we have performed most of the searches by placing o - te - o molecules within the cells , rather than separate atoms .",
    "another constraint we have employed is to reject initial configurations in which atoms are closer than a defined minimum separation .",
    "we have also generated initial configurations with the space groups which contain a specified number of symmetry operations , and then relaxed the structures while maintaining the symmetry .",
    "our dft calculations were performed using the castep@xcite plane wave code with the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) generalised gradient approximation ( gga ) exchange - correlation functional@xcite and ultrasoft pseudopotentials.@xcite for the searches we used a plane wave cut off energy of @xmath6 ev and a monkhorst - pack@xcite brillouin zone sampling grid spacing of @xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "all of the results reported in this paper were obtained by refining the structures obtained in the searches and calculating their properties using a higher level of accuracy consisting of a plane wave cut off energy of 800 ev and a grid spacing of @xmath9 @xmath8 .",
    "we first performed searches at 150 gpa .",
    "unconstrained searches were performed using @xmath10 and @xmath11 formula units of teo@xmath0 .",
    "another set of searches was performed using initial configurations built by applying the symmetry operations of space groups chosen randomly from those with @xmath12 operations to the randomly chosen positions of a te atom and two o atoms , with @xmath13 @xmath14 , @xmath11 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , all subject to a minimum separation of @xmath17  .",

    "[ cols=\"^ , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     in our experience , the appearance of a very low symmetry structure , such as @xmath31 , as a low enthalpy phase suggests that another structure of even lower enthalpy might exist .",
    "we therefore performed an additional type of search using the cell obtained by doubling that of @xmath31 in each direction , giving a cell containing 48 formula units .",
    "we then performed `` shakes '' of the larger structure in which all atoms were displaced in random directions by a distance chosen randomly between 0 and 0.25  , and then relaxed , but in each case the original @xmath31 structure was recovered .",

    "heating helps in overcoming kinetic barriers which are expected to be large in oxides and can also help to reduce anisotropic stresses .",
    "a temperature of @xmath37 k could , however , affect the coexistence pressure .",
    "the agreement between the measured transition pressure and the theoretical coexistence pressure is satisfactory , given the uncertainty in the experimental transition pressure and the fact that our calculations are at zero temperature .",
    "the maximum stabilization of the @xmath1 phase over cotunnite is about 0.031 ev per teo@xmath0 unit at 175 gpa , which is quite small but easily resolved in our calculations .",
    "such small enthalpy differences are often given quite accurately in dft calculations for @xmath5 bonded materials where the volumes and the nature of the inter - atomic bonding in the two phases are very similar , as is the case here .",
    "[ fig : h_vs_p ] shows that the @xmath31 structure is marginally the most stable in the pressure range 248269 gpa , although the enthalpies of the @xmath31 , @xmath1 , and cotunnite phases differ by less than 0.0023 ev per formula unit in this range .",

    "the region of high compressibility of the cotunnite structure is predominantly associated with compression along the @xmath41 axis , whilst the @xmath42 axis actually increases in length from @xmath43 to @xmath32 gpa , before continuing to decrease steadily with increasing pressure .",

    "the discrepancies in relative peak heights might arise from the form factors used to generate the theoretical data , from the differences in structures due to the approximate dft and from the lack of temperature effects in the theoretical structure .",
