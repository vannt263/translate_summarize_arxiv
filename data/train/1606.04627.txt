    "most close binary systems containing a white dwarf ( wd ) star are thought to be a result of one , or possibly two , episodes of unstable mass transfer producing a common envelope that engulfs both the donor star and its companion , called a common envelope ( ce ) phase @xcite . during the ce phase ,",
    "the core of the donor star and its companion lose angular momentum to the envelope , decreasing the separation of the components of the system .",
    "if sufficient angular momentum and energy can be transferred to the envelope , the envelope can be expelled and spiral - in terminated before merger , resulting in a close post - common envelope binary ( pceb ) , consisting of the core of the donor star and the companion , typically a main sequence ( ms ) star .",
    "in fact , hot subdwarf stars of b ( sdbs ) and o ( sdos ) type can assume the role of the donor in such a system as well .",
    "therefore , depending on the mass of the donor star and its evolution prior to the unstable mass transfer , the pceb can manifest itself as an ms star together with a wd or sdb / sdo star . depending on the type of ms star and the separation of the binary components",
    ", the system can further evolve to become a cataclysmic variable ( cv ) , or undergo a second ce phase resulting in a very compact binary comprising two wds or a wd and a helium star .",
    "a large number of pcebs have been identified observationally . using the observed pceb population ,",
    "comparisons can be made with theoretical estimates of pceb populations via binary population synthesis codes in order to infer characteristics of the ce phase @xcite .",
    "a useful technique for identifying pcebs is to test whether a candidate wd is a member of a binary system by either radial velocity measurements , e.g. using the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or looking for periodic variations in the light curve of the source using large synoptic surveys such as the palomar transient factory ( ptf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and catalina real - time transient sky survey ( crts ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite analysed a sample of 30 pcebs taken from various literature sources and discussed the age and space density of the pceb population .",
    "an updated catalogue of wd+ms binaries from sdss is described in @xcite , and as of 2015 december , the online catalogue lists 203 sources as pcebs , including 89 with period identifications .",
    "the web - based catalogue and @xcite provide additional references for discussions of pcebs found by sdss in a series of 16 articles between 2007 and 2012 .",
    "in particular , a large sample of 58 pcebs with orbital periods was reported by @xcite using sdss data . using crts , @xcite identified 29 eclipsing wd+ms binaries ( 12 new ) and period estimates were provided for an additional 13 non - eclipsing pcebs .",
    "more recently , @xcite identified another 17 eclipsing wd+ms binaries ( 14 new ) from sdss and crts using a colour - selected list that targets binaries with cool wds and/or early m - type ms stars .",
    "in addition , @xcite have found several cool wd+m - dwarf binaries with periods less than 0.22  d , and @xcite reported three eclipsing wd+m - dwarf binaries using ptf data .",
    "more generally , both crts and ptf have been used to search for pcebs not limited to wd+ms systems .",
    "these include eclipsing variables that can be in contact or semidetached  @xcite as well as pcebs with sdb / sdo components rather than wds @xcite .    in this paper , we present a sample of 59 periodic wd binary candidate systems from the ptf , previously unknown . for a more complete phase coverage ,",
    "we cross - checked each object with photometric measurements from the crts .",
    "a period estimate is provided for each of the 59 periodic sources .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : candidates ] outlines the wd catalogues that contribute to the list of candidates and provides the selection criteria for the present periodicity search .",
    "section  [ sec : period ] discusses the methods used to detect periodicity as well as the likely astrophysical origins of luminosity variations in compact binary systems .",
    "the eclipsing variables among them are discussed individually .",
    "section  [ sec : spectra ] describes spectroscopic measurements on a subset of the periodic sources .",
    "section  [ sec : selection ] examines the selection effects and assesses the fidelity of the selection procedure .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] provides a summary of the main conclusions of the paper .",
    "ptf employs the palomar @xmath0-inch oschin schmidt telescope ( p48 ) to search for optical transients and variables and the @xmath1-inch telescope ( p60 ) for photometric follow - up .",
    "the p48 camera has a field of view of @xmath2 @xmath3 with a sky coverage of @xmath4 @xmath5 using cadences from @xmath6  min to @xmath7  d , and the 60-s standard exposure time per frame yields a @xmath8 limiting magnitude of 20.5 in the @xmath9 band @xcite .",
    "we searched for optical variability in ptf aperture photometry data , processed and calibrated as described in @xcite and further adjusted using relative photometric algorithms from @xcite , for sources in the following , three hot star / wd catalogues ",
    "the spectroscopic wd+ms binary catalogue from the eighth data release ( dr8 ) of sdss ( @xcite ) , the spectroscopic wd catalogue from sdss dr7 @xcite , and the catalogue of photometrically selected uv sources and hot wds from galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) uv imaging @xcite . for each source in these catalogues",
    ", we searched for matches in the ptf data base with at least 20 measurements in the @xmath9 band .",
    "the ptf mould @xmath9-band filter is similar in shape to the sdss @xmath10-band filter but shifted @xmath11    redward . for the present survey , we only considered the @xmath9-band photometry since most sources have insufficient @xmath12-band data , but",
    "this is likely to change in the future as additional @xmath12-band observations are carried out . to detect strong periodic candidates",
    ", we used the lomb - scargle ( l - s ) periodogram @xcite , a least - square spectral analysis method for unevenly sampled data , with modifications for detrending .",
    "the periodogram retains simple statistical behaviour when the time series is randomly sampled in time .",
    "we imposed a filtering cut of @xmath8 above the median power spectrum density ( psd ) on a period search grid between 0.1  d and the sampling time range , and the false positives were ruled out by visually parsing the light curves , as described in section  [ sec : period ] . in addition , we examined those objects with an above-1  mag amplitude of photometric variation in the hope of identifying eclipsing binaries .",
    "finally , we ruled out artefacts through visual inspection of ptf images .",
    "table  [ table : sources ] summarizes the number of selected sources by their catalogue of origin .    in total , the selection procedure yielded 218 variable candidates from the three catalogues , excluding repetitions . to improve phase coverage , we supplemented them with crts photometry and the six sources not covered by crts were excluded .",
    "for the 59 periodic variables in our sample , the median number of measurements is 138 for ptf and 300 for crts .",
    "the observation times for both ptf and crts data were converted to modified heliocentric julian date ( mhjd ) for the subsequent analysis .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : obs ]          this source was observed five times with an exposure of 900s each on the night of 2013-july-15 .",
    "the observations were consecutive exposures covering roughly 84min including readout , so we covered roughly 40% of the 0.16d orbit . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] , the spectra resemble that of a hot wd with some balmer emission lines superimposed .",
    "first , we fitted for the radial velocity of the balmer emission lines using narrow gaussians as the template and found best - fitting velocities for each spectrum from @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "we then masked the portion of each spectrum affected by the balmer emission lines and used the remaining data to fit a hot wd atmosphere .",
    "we obtained @xmath15k and @xmath16 , our closest model to the published values of @xmath17 and @xmath18k @xcite .",
    "each model was convolved with the spectral response of our data , described by a gaussian with a full width at half - maximum of 5  set by the typical seeing of 1.8 arcsec and truncated at 1.5 arcsec to mimic the slit ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we then used an 11th order polynomial to fit the continuum .",
    "the fits are good , with typical @xmath19 for 1670 degrees of freedom .",
    "the resulting velocities range from @xmath20 to @xmath21 , with typical uncertainties of @xmath22 .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] that the velocities of the balmer emission lines are not the same as the wd atmosphere fits , suggesting that they originated in different parts of the binary system .",
    "in fact , the emission - line velocities are roughly @xmath23 out of phase with the atmosphere fits .",
    "a likely explanation is that the emission lines can be attributed to the emission from the heated day side of a low - mass companion .",
    "we estimate the wd - to - companion mass ratio to be roughly 2 to 3 from the radial velocity amplitude ratio of the balmer emission lines compared to the wd absorption lines , although given the poor phase coverage , we can not be more precise . the surface gravity and temperature imply a mass of about 0.45@xmath24 for the wd when compared to the da evolutionary models from @xcite , so the companion mass is around 0.2@xmath24 .",
    "ptf1 j2235 + 1428 , observed four times with an exposure of 900s each on the night of 2013-july-15 , was reported by @xcite as a deep ( @xmath25 mag ) eclipsing pceb .",
    "we had two pairs of consecutive exposures separated by roughly 75min , so the total span of the observations is slightly more than half of an orbit . similar to ptf1 j1730 + 3334 , the spectra resemble that of a hot wd with some balmer emission lines superimposed , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : spectra ] .",
    "we fit the data using a wd atmosphere model with @xmath26k and @xmath16 , our closest model to the published values of @xmath27 and @xmath28k @xcite , using an identical fitting procedure as ptf1 j1730 + 3334 .",
    "the fits are good , with typical @xmath29 for 1670 degrees of freedom .",
    "we found that the first pair of exposures have similar velocities of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , while the second pair are significant shifted ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) .    ptf1 j0113 + 2257 is a newly discovered eclipsing binary that has the shortest orbital period ( @xmath34  d ) among the 59 periodic candidates in our catalogue .",
    "this source was observed four times  once on 2014 july 30 for 300s and three times on 2014 october 31 for 600s each , separated by roughly one hour .",
    "it appears to be a subdwarf with visible lines of he  i in addition to the broad balmer lines . using a series of sdb atmospheres covering @xmath35k to k and @xmath36 or @xmath37",
    ", we were able to get a best fit using @xmath38k and @xmath39 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] .",
    "note that the best fit values are at the extreme grid points of our sdbs models .",
    "in particular , this model has a logarithmic helium abundance of @xmath40 = -1 $ ] , the lowest value in our grid , and many of the he  i lines present in the model are not seen or are weaker than predicted .",
    "thomas kupfer ( private communication ) , however , found @xmath41 @xmath42  k and @xmath43 with a helium abundance of @xmath44 using a more extensive range of sdb models .",
    "the fitted radial velocities turn out to span a much smaller range ( @xmath45 to @xmath46 ) compared to ptf1 j2235 + 1428 .",
    "some of the selection criteria used to identify periodic sources are not necessarily strict as they rely on manual inspection and filtering . as a result , it is difficult to quantify the selection effects in our sample and we resort to exploiting qualitative clues on physical grounds .",
    "radial velocity searches favour binaries with a high primary - to - companion mass ratio , whose companion semi - amplitude goes as @xmath47^{1/3},\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the orbital period , and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the masses of the primary ( wd ) and companion , respectively @xcite . on the other hand , this work is based on optical variability originated primarily from ellipsoidal variation and reflection . for both mechanisms ,",
    "a high modulation amplitude strongly favours close binaries , as discussed in section  [ subsection : period_determination ] .",
    "specifically , in contrast to radial velocity searches , they require one of the components ( primarily for ellipsoidal modulation and secondarily for reflection ) to be very close to filling its roche lobe , with additional preference for a high companion - to - primary mass ratio for ellipsoidal modulation as shown in eq .  .    to investigate the selection effects in a more quantitative fashion , we cross - checked our sample of periodic sources with 36 of the 58 pcebs from @xcite , henceforth denoted as ngm , that have more than 20 ptf measurements",
    "it appears that the intersection between the two samples is null save one system , ptf1 j1559 + 0356 .",
    "ngm reported a period estimate of @xmath51  h , whereas we obtained @xmath52  h from l - s periodogram .",
    "the two estimates differ by one part per 500 .",
    "a closer look reveals that the ngm sources have fewer photometric measurements in ptf compared to our sample , with a median of 71 versus 153 .",
    "in addition , they are relatively fainter in ptf with a median magnitude of 18.4 versus 16.7 , resulting in larger photometric errors .",
    "the combined effect made them more difficult to detect in a l - s periodogram , as evidenced by a median peak psd of 8.0 versus 47.0 .",
    "finally , ngm identified 65 of the 79 pcebs via radial velocity measurements instead of photometry , and we expect the detection biases in the foregoing discussion to also contribute to the limited overlap between the two samples .    in table  [ table : p ] , the majority of the periodic variables are in @xcite only , and the lack of classification spectra gives rise to the possibility that the sample may contain sdo / sdb binaries instead of purely wd binaries .",
    "in particular , about @xmath53 of sdbs reside in close binaries , with either a wd or ms companion @xcite . in general , subdwarfs have a larger radius compared to wds and are typically more luminous , resulting in more pronounced reflection effect .",
    "to gain insights into the spectral type of the companion star , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : pc ] the sdss @xmath54 and @xmath55 colours for the periodic variables in our sample , along with the da and db model tracks from @xcite and the ms stellar locus from @xcite . for the sake of comparison",
    ", we also include the 36 ngm objects , which have larger @xmath54 and @xmath55 colours than our sample . the discrepancy is expected since they are wd+ms binaries , which should result in a bias towards redder companions .",
    "quantitatively , we created synthetic wd+ms photometry by combining fluxes of a model m4 star and das of selected masses , all taken from the aforementioned model tracks .",
    "the choice of binary components reflects the dominant spectral type in the ngm sample , as 14 of the 36 sources have been identified as da+m4 systems @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pc ] , the resulting binary tracks are in good agreement with the ngm sources , confirming our intuition .",
    "in addition , it is possible that our sample appears hotter on average , since a significant portion consists of variables potentially exhibiting reflection effect .    in summary , our sample complements those reported by ngm and @xcite but can not be considered complete due to selection effects . however , future quantitative cross - comparison of the samples can serve as steps towards estimating selection effects in the hope of compiling a pceb sample from which population characteristics , such as the intrinsic orbital period distribution , can be more accurately inferred .     for he",
    "wds ( light green : da ; turquoise : db ) from @xcite as well as ms stellar locus ( gray ) from @xcite . a selected number of @xmath56 values and mk spectral type labels are shown along the model tracks . in addition",
    ", synthetic binaries comprising an m4 secondary and a da primary with a mass of @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 are shown in shades of purple , from light to dark .",
    "variables with @xmath60  d are highlighted by bigger markers with black edges , and a reddening vector with @xmath61 magnitude of extinction was computed using extinction coefficients for sdss filters from @xcite . ]",
    "we investigated the false alarm probability of the present search by applying the same selection procedure on a sample of non - variable stars .",
    "the sdss stripe 82 standard star catalogue @xcite contains photometrically identified standard stars located in stripe 82 ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) . since sdss has imaged this region over 10 times , the catalogue is sufficiently homogeneous @xcite .",
    "additionally , since the median magnitude of these standard stars ( 19.61 ) is close to that of the sources from the three catalogues listed in table  [ table : sources ] ( 19.56 ) , we arbitrarily selected 10000 stars from stripe 82 as our control sample . a query in the ptf data base returned 7764 objects with more than 20 data points , of which only 36 passed the machine filtering criteria ( metrics : l - s psd and amplitude ) .",
    "by visually inspecting these 36 objects , we concluded that only one ( ptf1 j20340021 ) is potentially outbursting . even though this object is faint in ptf with a median magnitude of @xmath64 and has only one point in outburst ,",
    "we included it as a potential false positive .",
    "we thus estimated the worst - case false alarm probability as @xmath65 .",
    "furthermore , we computed the probability that a non - periodic source was identified as periodic through a monte carlo simulation . for each periodic candidate in our sample",
    ", we calculated the maximum psd @xmath66 using its ptf light curve . by shuffling the magnitudes while keeping each epoch",
    ", we produced a set of mock light curve and determined the corresponding peak psd , denoted by @xmath67 .",
    "a distribution of the mock l - s peaks was obtained by generating 1000 sets of such data . by comparing @xmath66 and each @xmath67",
    ", we constructed the null hypothesis probability ( @xmath68 : no periodicity ) as @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is defined as the number of mock time series such that @xmath71 .",
    "it turns out that we obtained @xmath72 for all cases .",
    "one caveat is that the simulation would not detect a false period as identified by the l - s periodogram ; it simply determines that the strongest peak in the periodogram is no chance occurrence .",
    "therefore , it is still possible that we have non - periodic signals in our sample due to artefacts such as diffraction spikes and harmonics of the sampling .",
    "we have removed these to the best of our ability through a series of manual checks described in section [ subsection : period_determination ] and therefore believe that the vast majority of the reported periodic variables are genuine .",
    "we have presented a sample of 59 periodic wd and/or sdb / sdo binary candidates from ptf light curves , of which were not previously identified as periodic variables .",
    "the sample also includes three newly identified eclipsing binaries .",
    "our work adds significantly to the roughly 100 previously identified pcebs with orbital period estimates , providing additional individual sources for further characterization of component types , masses , and separations .",
    "knowledge of these binary parameters will aid future work towards estimating a bias - corrected population of pcebs .",
    "the present sample was drawn from published catalogues of spectroscopically and photometrically selected wd candidates and relied on ptf data from higher galactic latitudes ( @xmath73 ) . since 2012 , ptf has initiated an optical variability survey of the galactic plane , and we expect future analysis of these data to yield an additional large sample of pceb sources .",
