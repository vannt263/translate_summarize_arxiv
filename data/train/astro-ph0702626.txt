    "this mismatch between theory and observations may indicate that simple drift time estimates are missing important dynamical effects .",
    "several mechanisms could impede the radial influx of solids .",
    "the increased inertia of solids in a dense midplane sublayer decreases drift speeds as the local gas mass fraction squared @xcite .",
    "since such high densities may trigger rapid gravitational collapse of solids @xcite , sedimentation alone is not a satisfactory explanation of the long lifetimes of pebbles in the disks , even if the turbulence is weak enough to allow the formation of an extremely thin mid - plane layer .",
    "turbulent diffusion in accretion disks will maintain a small fraction of particles in the outer disk @xcite , but this scenario requires a particle reservoir that exceeds by far the observed amount of mm - sized solids and thus implies disk masses that are orders of magnitude larger than minimum mass models .",

    "dense clumps of solids plow through the gas at near the keplerian speed , scooping up more isolated particles that move with the sub - keplerian headwind .",
    "since this particle concentration mechanism relies on two - way drag forces , it was ( and still is ) considered a non - linear manifestation of streaming instabilities .",
    "the current work further explores active concentration , isolating the role of drag feedback by ignoring vertical stratification .",
    "we consider different geometries , both axisymmetric in the radial - vertical plane and fully 3-d , than @xcite , who considered the azimuthal - vertical plane , and we use the higher order interpolation scheme for drag forces described in yj .",

    "turbulent diffusion controls the extent to which particles sediment in the mid - plane @xcite and whether ( or how fast ) self - gravity can collect solids into rings and bound clumps @xcite .",
    "diffusion is the most fundamental parameter governing whether planetesimals can form by gravitational instability ( as originally proposed by @xcite ) , because the oft - mentioned critical density for gravitational collapse is irrelevant when drag forces are included to transfer angular momentum from the solids to the gas @xcite .",
    "passive diffusion of particles in magnetorotational turbulence has been found to be quite strong @xcite , although the schmidt number ( the ratio between the turbulent viscosity of the gas and the particle diffusion ) increases in the presence of a net vertical magnetic field @xcite . in the present work we measure the active particle diffusion in streaming turbulence , by considering the random walk of the particles away from a reference point , and find it to be relatively weak , especially for smaller particles .",

    "the run with the tightest coupling and lowest initial solids - to - gas density ratio , and consequently the lowest linear growth rate , developed very meek non - linear density fluctuations .",

    "further studies of the streaming instability for smaller particles , such as chondrules , would be interesting , but are computationally costly ( see  [ s : tight ] ) .    it is hardly surprising that the solids - to - gas density ratio strongly affects the non - linear state since the streaming instability relies on particle feedback to influence gas dynamics .",
    "however , the sharp transition across particle - gas equality is remarkable , especially for tight coupling  the weak streaming instabilities in the gas - dominated regime become explosive once the solids - to - gas ratio reaches unity .",
