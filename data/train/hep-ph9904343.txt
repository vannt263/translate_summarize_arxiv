    "the integration region is considered to be divided into a number of , say @xmath0 bins , so that it becomes a function of @xmath0 random variables , namely the number of points in each of the bins .",
    "furthermore , the lego discrepancy is defined such that it is exactly the @xmath1-statistic of the binned data points .    in @xcite , we have given criteria for the asymptotic probability distribution of various quadratic discrepancies to become gaussian when a certain free parameter becomes infinitely large .",
    "this parameter often is the dimension @xmath3 of the integration region . in the case of the lego discrepancy , it is the number of bins @xmath0 . in @xcite , it is shown that for the _ fourier diaphony _ a gaussian limit is obtained when both @xmath2 and @xmath3 go to infinity such that @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is some constant larger than @xmath6 .",
    "this theorem clearly gives more information about the behavior of the probability distribution than the statements of @xmath7 , for it relates @xmath3 and @xmath2 , whereas in @xcite the limit of @xmath8 is assumed before considering the behavior with respect to @xmath3 or @xmath0 .    in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we introduced techniques to calculate the @xmath9 expansion of the moment generating function of the probability distribution of quadratic discrepancies , and applied it to the @xmath10-discrepancy , the fourier diaphony ( both for @xmath11 ) , and the lego discrepancy .",
    "such an expansion can be used to calculate corrections to the asymptotic distribution for @xmath8 , but , presented as in @xcite , it can not give information about limits if @xmath0 or @xmath3 become infinite also . in this paper",
    "we use the mentioned technique to calculate limits for the lego discrepancy if @xmath0 as well as @xmath2 become infinite .",
    "first , we will show that the natural expansion parameter in the calculation of the moment generating function is @xmath12 , and calculate a few terms .",
    "we will see , however , that a strict limit of @xmath13 does not exist , and , in fact , this is well known because the @xmath1-distribution , which gives the lowest order term in this expansion , does not exist if the number of degrees of freedom becomes infinite .",
    "we overcome this problem by going over to the standardized variable , which is obtained from the discrepancy by shifting and rescaling it such that it has zero expectation and unit variance .",
    "in fact , it is this variable for which the results in @xcite and @xcite were obtained . in this paper",
    ", we derive similar results for the lego discrepancy , depending on the behavior of the sizes of the bins if @xmath0 goes to infinity .",
    "we will see that various asymptotic probability distributions occur if @xmath14 such that @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "if , for example , the bins become asymptotically equal and @xmath17 , then the probability distribution becomes gaussian .",
    "notice that this includes limits with @xmath18 , which is in stark contrast with the rule of thumb that , in order to trust the @xmath1-distribution , each bin has to contain at least a few , say five ( see e.g. @xcite ) , data points .",
    "our result states that , for large @xmath0 and @xmath2 , the majority of bins is allowed to remain empty !",
    "the @xmath1-statistic for @xmath2 data points distributed over @xmath0 bins with expected number of points @xmath20 for bin @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number of points in bin @xmath24 .",
    "if the data points are distributed truly random , i.e. , if they are independent and if the probability for a point to fall in bin @xmath24 is equal to @xmath25 , then it is distributed along a multinomial distribution : @xmath26 }     \\;=\\ ; \\sum_{\\{{\\mathcal{n}}_m\\}}\\theta(t-\\chi^2)\\ ,            n!\\prod_{m=1}^m\\frac{w^{{\\mathcal{n}}_m}}{{\\mathcal{n}}_m ! }    \\;\\;,\\ ] ] where the sum is over all configurations @xmath27 with @xmath28 . in the limit of an infinite number of data points ,",
    "this becomes the @xmath1-distribution , which has moment generating function @xmath29 a first step in the interpretation of this statistic as a quadratic discrepancy is the insight that it is quadratic in the variables @xmath23 and can be characterized by a matrix with elements @xmath30 so that @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the bins are disjunct subsets of an integration region , and that the data points @xmath32 , @xmath33 are in this integration region .",

    "in the following , we will investigate limits in which the number of bins @xmath0 goes to infinity . note that for each value of @xmath0 , we have to decide on the values of the measures @xmath34 .",

    ", we will consider functions of @xmath0 and their behavior if @xmath13 .",
    "to specify relative behaviors , we will use the symbols `` @xmath50 '' , `` @xmath51 '' and `` @xmath52 '' .",

    "in which @xmath56 we use the third symbol : @xmath57 we will also use the @xmath58-symbol , and do this in the usual sense .",

    "we will , however , never denote the dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath0 explicitly and assume that it is clear from now on . also the upper index at the measures",
    "@xmath34 we will omit from now on .",
    "in @xcite and @xcite we have shown that the moment generating function @xmath62}$ ] of the probability distribution of the lego discrepancy can be written as an integral over @xmath0 ordinary degrees of freedom ( the _ bosons _ ) and @xmath63 grasmannian degrees of freedom ( the _ fermions _ ) .",
    "the integral is not unique and contains a _",
    "gauge freedom_. furthermore , it introduces a natural expansion parameter @xmath64 to calculate the generating function perturbatively .",
    "in one particular gauge , the _ landau _ gauge , the terms are equal to the contribution of _ feynman diagrams _ , that can be calculated according to the following rules : @xmath65 to calculate a term in the expansion series , the contribution of all _ vacuum _ diagrams , i.e. all diagrams without external legs , carrying the same power of @xmath66 has to be taken into account . in the landau gauge , only _ connected _ diagrams have to be calculated , for @xmath67 in the vertices , boson propagators are convoluted as @xmath68 , fermion propagators as @xmath69 , and then these convolutions are multiplied . as a result of this , the bosonic part of each diagram decouples completely from the fermionic part .",
    "the contribution of the fermionic part can easily be determined , for @xmath70      because of the rather simple expression ( [ legeq002 ] ) for the bosonic propagator , we are able to deduce from the basic feynman rules some effective rules for the bosonic parts of the feynman diagrams .",
    "remember that the bosonic parts decouples completely from the fermionic parts .",
    "the following rules apply after having counted the number of fermion loops and the powers of @xmath66 coming from the vertices , and after having calculated the symmetry factor of the original diagram .",
    "when we mention the _ contribution _ of a diagram in this section , we refer to the contribution apart from the powers of @xmath66 and symmetry factors .",
    "this contribution will be represented by the same drawing as the diagram itself .",
    "the first rule is a consequence of the fact that @xmath71 and states that all vertices with only two legs that do not form a single loop can be removed .",
    "the second rule is a consequence of the fact that for any @xmath72-matrix @xmath73 @xmath74 and states that the contribution of a diagram is the same as that of the diagram in which a boson line is contracted and the two vertices , connected to that line , are fused together to form one vertex , minus the contribution of the diagram in which the line is simply removed and the vertices replaced by vertices with one boson leg less .",
    "this rule can be depicted as follows @xmath75 by repeated application of these rules , we see that the contribution of a connected bosonic diagram is equal to the contribution of a sum of products of so called _ daisy _ diagrams  ] , which are of the type @xmath76 they are characterized by the fact that all lines begin and end on the same vertex and form single loops .",

    "diagrammatically , the rule looks like @xmath84 in @xcite we called discrepancies for which eq .",
    "( [ legeq016 ] ) is exact one - vertex decomposable , and have shown that for those discrepancies only the _ one - vertex irreducible _ diagrams contribute , i.e. , diagrams that do not fall apart in pieces containing bosonic parts if a vertex is cut .",
    "the previous rule tells us that , if @xmath48 @xmath49 , then @xmath85 the connected one - vertex irreducible diagrams we call _ relevant _ and the others",
    "we want to determine the contribution of the diagrams in this section , and in order to do that , we need to introduce some notation : @xmath86 these quantities are in principle functions of the diagrams , but we will never denote this dependence explicitly , for it will always be clear which diagram we are referring to when we use the quantities .    with the foregoing , we deduce that the contribution @xmath87 of a connected diagram @xmath88 with no external legs satisfies @xmath89 the feynman rules and basic graph theory tell us that , for connected diagrams with no external legs , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , so that @xmath92 if we furthermore use that @xmath93 , we find that the contribution is given by @xmath94 notice that this expression does not depend on @xmath95 .",
    "furthermore , it is clear that , for large @xmath0 and @xmath2 , the largest contribution comes from diagrams with @xmath96 .",
    "moreover , we see that we must have @xmath97 , for else the contribution of higher - order diagrams will grow with the number of boson loops , and the perturbation series becomes completely senseless .",
    "if , however , @xmath98 , then the contribution of each diagram with @xmath96 is more important than the contribution of each of the diagrams with @xmath99 .",
    "finally , we also see that the contribution of the @xmath100-corrections of a diagram ( eq .  ( [ legeq021 ] ) ) is always negligible compared to the leading contribution of each diagram with @xmath96 .",
    "these observations lead to the conclusion that , if @xmath2 and @xmath0 become large with @xmath101 , then the leading contribution to @xmath102 comes from the diagrams with @xmath96 , and that there are no corrections to these contributions .",
    "if we assume that @xmath12 is small , then the importance of these diagrams decreases with the number of boson loops @xmath78 as @xmath103 .",
    "now we calculate the first few terms in the loop expansion of @xmath102 .",
    "we start with the diagrams with one loop ( remember that it is an expansion in boson loops and that we only have to calculate _ connected _ diagrams for @xmath102 ) . the sum of all @xmath6-loop diagrams with @xmath96 is given by @xmath105 and this is exactly equal to @xmath106 as we know it for the lego - discrepancy ( cf.@xcite ) .",
