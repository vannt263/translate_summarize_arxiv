    "we have added 0.24 dex to the o / h ratio , this correction comes from the average value of 13 well observed extragalactic regions ( esteban et al . 2002 , 2009 ; lpez - snchez et al .",
    "note that the fe / o ratio is almost independent of the temperature structure since it is determined from a ratio of collisionally excited lines that show a similar temperature dependence .",
    "part of the scatter in figure 6 could be due to errors in the determinations of the gas - phase fe / o ratios and part to the different star formation histories of the different galaxies .",
    "the closer in time to a recent burst of star formation the lower the total fe / o ratio in their ism . in the solar vicinity at present all the o abundance is due to core collapse supernovae , while about 40% of the fe is due to core collapse supernovae and the other 60% to type ia supernovae ( e. g. pagel & tautvaisiene 1995 , pagel 2009 ) .",
    "there is a time delay in the fe formation relative to the o formation , and consequently the fe / o ratio depends on the star formation rate , the initial stellar mass function , and the gas flows from and into the intergalactic medium .",
    "there are two well established fe / o ratios from observations : the one when the sun was formed , called the protosolar ratio that amounts to @xmath105 dex ( asplund et al .",
    "2009 ) , and the present value in the solar vicinity based on observations of b stars that amounts to @xmath106 dex ( przybilla et al .",
    "2008 ) ; from the protosolar value plus the modification due to galactic chemical evolution we find a value of fe / o = @xmath107 dex for the present ism ( see table 1 ) . from the average of the previous 2 values we obtain an fe / o = @xmath101 dex .",
    "> from figure 6 and under the assumption that the total fe / o ratio amounts to @xmath101 dex , we obtain that for the galactic and extragalactic regions with abundances in the 8.3 dex @xmath108 o / h @xmath108 8.8 dex range the average fraction of fe in the gaseous - phase is about 10% , with some of them reaching 3% . for the extragalactic regions with abundances in the 7.8 dex @xmath108",

    "the fe / o variation as a function of o / h implies that in the high metallicity high density galactic regions about 97% of the fe atoms are embedded in dust grains .",
    "this fraction diminishes with diminishing o / h and in the metal poorest extragalactic regions , characterized by high electron temperature and low electron density , about 40% of the fe atoms are embedded in dust grains .",
    "the si / o ratio is approximately constant from the o richest to the o poorest regions , implying that for the whole o / h observed range the fraction of si embedded in dust grains amounts to about @xmath109 .",
    "a possible explanation for these two results is that dust grains have a solid core with about 72 % of the si and about 40% of the fe atoms present in the ism , and that in addition they have a softer mantle with about 57% of the fe present in the ism .",
    "the softer mantle is destroyed at higher temperatures and lower densities , while the solid core remains intact in all the regions of the sample .",
    "we have only the estimate of mg@xmath43/h for the orion nebula and for 30 doradus .",
    "the 30 doradus results imply that mg@xmath43/h is similar to si@xmath43/h and a lot larger than fe@xmath43/h . for the orion",
    "nebula the mg@xmath43/h is intermediate between si@xmath43/h and fe@xmath43/h .",
    "jenkins ( 2009 ) finds that in lines of sight dominated by neutral material the mg and si depletions are very similar and considerably smaller than those of fe . from these results",
    "we will explore two possibilities for the region set : a ) that mg@xmath43/h is equal to si@xmath43/h , and b ) that mg@xmath43/h is intermediate between si@xmath43/h and fe@xmath43/h .",

    "the limiting values for the o depletion are : 0.08 dex for the o poorest objects , based on the observations of sbs  0335@xmath0052  e , one of the o poorest objects known ; and 0.12 dex for the orion nebula one of the richest objects with a good determination .",
    "note that the upper limit given by equation ( 1 ) is 0.14 dex if no mg , si , or fe atoms remain the gas phase .",
    "we decided to divide the sample in three o / h groups : a ) 7.3 @xmath108 o / h @xmath108 7.8 dex , b ) 7.8 @xmath108 o / h @xmath108 8.3 dex , and c ) 8.3 dex @xmath108 o / h @xmath108 8.8 dex .",
    "we took the fe@xmath43/o@xmath44 average of all the regions in each interval as representative of each group , and from equation ( 1 ) we computed table 4 .",
    "in the first row of table 4 we present the o depletions , under the assumption that the ism reference values are given by mg / o = @xmath119 dex , si / o = @xmath101 dex , and fe / o = @xmath101 dex , and that mg@xmath43/h is equal to si@xmath43/h ; in the second row of table 4 we have assumed that mg@xmath43/h is intermediate between to the si@xmath43/h and fe@xmath43/h .",
    "finally in the last row of table 4 we present our adopted values .",
    "so far we have not included the systematic error present in equation 1 due the depletion determinations of the orion nebula ( our absolute calibrator ) .",
    "this systematic error is comparable to the trends that we have found , and makes any given absolute determination uncertain , but the differences derived between two objects are not affected by this error .",
    "the systematic error is about one fourth of the estimated o depletion and , including the possible errors in the reference values of mg , si , and fe , translates to a final error of 0.03 dex for each of the 3 intervals discussed in this paper .",
    "from the 3d-4f @xmath114481 recombination line intensities we have derived the mg / h abundance ratio for the orion nebula and for 30 doradus . from this abundance ratio we have estimated that in the orion nebula and in 30 doradus about 9% and 27% of the mg atoms are in the gas phase respectively , and that the rest of the mg atoms are embedded in dust grains .",
    "we have reduced the fors raw data for sbs  0335@xmath0052  e and have measured four of the eight lines of multiplet 1 and from the @xmath4(4639 + 4641 + 4649 + 51)/@xmath4(h@xmath59 value we obtain that 12 + log ( o@xmath16/h@xmath3)@xmath120 and that the total o / h value amounts to @xmath62 dex .",
    "we find that the gaseous fe / h ratio has a typical value of about 6.25 dex with a dispersion of about 0.30 dex for regions with o / h in the 7.3 to 8.8 dex range .",
    "the almost constancy of the gas - phase fe / h ratio reflects the efficiency of the processes of dust formation and dust destruction .",
    "it probably implies that there is a minimum threshold for dust formation given by a gas - phase fe / h ratio of about 5.8 dex .",
    "based on the mg / o , si / o , and fe / o abundances of galactic and extragalactic regions we estimate that : for the 8.3 dex @xmath108 o / h @xmath108 8.8 dex range the fraction of o atoms trapped by dust grains amounts to @xmath121 dex , for the 7.8 @xmath108 o / h @xmath108 8.3 dex range amounts to @xmath122 dex , and for the 7.3 @xmath108 o / h @xmath108 7.8 dex range amounts to @xmath123 dex .",
    "note that if one of the adopted reference values for mg , s , and fe were increased or decreased by 0.1 dex the o depletions mentioned above change by about 0.002 dex .",
    "we also consider that the region abundances derived from the @xmath25(4363/5007 ) method underestimate the o / h ratio by about 0.15 to 0.35 dex ( e. g. peimbert , m. & peimbert , a. 2010b , and references therein ) .",
    "this result together with the fraction of o atoms embedded in dust grains imply that to obtain the gas - phase plus the dust - phase o / h value it is necessary to increase the o / h gas values derived from the @xmath25(4363/5007 ) method by about 0.25 to 0.45 dex",
