    "the area spectral efficiency of wireless networks requires a dense deployment of infrastructure and aggressive frequency reuse  @xcite . with shrinkage of the cell size , the number of cell edges  and the number of cell - edge users  in the network increases .",

    "prior work on network mimo has mainly considered 2d cellular layouts and focused only on the horizontal plane of the wireless channel  @xcite , while ignoring the vertical dimension . because of the 3d nature of the real - world wireless channel , employing network mimo in the horizontal plane as the only ici management strategy in the network seems like an inefficient and complex approach that can not fully exploit all the degrees of freedom offered by the channel .    in a less complex form of multicell cooperation ,",
    "commonly referred to as _ coordinated beamforming _",
    ", only the csi of users is shared among the bss to enable joint beamforming design , while the data for each user is transmitted by a single bs . with no need of data sharing , coordinated beamforming",
    "has significantly reduced signaling requirements compared to network mimo .",
    "one simple coordinated beamfroming strategy is to exploit the vertical plane of the wireless channel for ici management via coordinatively adapting the elevation angle of the bs antenna pattern , denoted as tilt . by appropriately selecting the tilt ,",
    "it is possible to increase the desired signal level at an intended user , while reducing the ici towards a non - intended user . in conventional cellular networks",
    "typically a fixed tilt is used at all bss over all time - slots .",
    "this tilting strategy , denoted as _ cell - specific tilting _ , can not adapt to the particular locations of the scheduled users .",
    "therefore , users at different locations of the cell experience different antenna gains .",
    "for example , users close to the peak of the main beam observe a high antenna gain , while those close to the side - lobes experience a low antenna gain . with advances in antenna technology , it is possible to adapt the tilt rapidly using baseband processing  @xcite .",
    "this makes tilt an important parameter in the design of intercell interference management techniques .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a hybrid multicell cooperation strategy that adaptively exploits either the horizontal plane or the vertical plane of the wireless channel to manage the ici experienced by users , denoted as _ adaptive multicell 3d beamforming_. the key idea consists of partitioning the coverage area into disjoint `` vertical '' regions and adapting the multicell cooperation strategy to serve the users in each vertical region .",
    "csi and data sharing are required only when the ici management is performed in the horizontal plane .",
    "our analytical and numerical results provide useful insights for the design of practical multicell cooperation strategies .",
    "dynamic tilt adaptation as an additional degree of freedom for designing efficient multicell cooperation techniques has recently attracted a lot of interest  @xcite .",
    "the authors in  @xcite , have developed a coordinated beamforming framework in which intercell interference is controlled solely in the vertical plane via joint adaptation of bss tilts to the locations of the users .",
    "this approach requires the knowledge of the users locations at all the bss , which is usually very difficult to obtain .",
    "an alternative tilt adaptation strategy is to divide the coverage area into so - called _ vertical regions _ and use one out of a finite number of fixed tilts at the bs to serve each region . with this tilting strategy , which is denoted here as _",
    "switched - beam tilting _ , it is possible to increase the received signal power at a specific region in the desired cell , suppress the ici at certain regions in the neighboring cells , or a combination thereof . in addition",
    ", switched - beam tilting does not require any knowledge about the locations of the users as a fixed tilt is applied to serve each vertical region .",
    "the work in  @xcite has studied different switched - beam tilting strategies for intercell interference avoidance .",
    "this work is , however , based on system - level simulations and does not provide any design guidelines , e.g. , how to form vertical regions , how to choose the optimum tilts for different regions , or how to fairly schedule the transmission over different regions .",
    "in  @xcite , the authors investigated different methods to form vertical regions and determine the optimum tilt for each region in an isolated cell , but ici was not considered .",
    "one of the challenges in analyzing network mimo performance in the presence of tilt is the lack of analytical performance measures .",
    "available techniques for the ergodic rate analysis of mimo systems mostly assume channel vectors with _ independently and identically distributed _",
    "( i.i.d . ) elements , which simplifies the analysis significantly ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "such techniques , however , can not be directly applied in the network mimo setting . in this case",
    "each user might experience a different pathloss to each bs , and hence the elements of its aggregate channel vector to all bss are _ non - identically _ distributed in general . in  @xcite , using the results from random matrix theory , a large system approximation for the ergodic sum - rate was derived for the uplink of a network mimo system .",
    "closed - form approximations for the user ergodic rate in downlink network mimo transmission were derived in  @xcite .",
    "a limitation of  @xcite is that they assume perfect csi at all bss .",
    "ergodic rate analysis of network mimo under imperfect csi has been recently investigated in  @xcite .",
    "the work in  @xcite considered the single - user scenario in which only one user is served using network mimo .",
    "the author further assumed eigen - beamforming at each bs that makes the beamforming design independent of the pathloss of the user to the bss . in this case , the ergodic rate analysis is performed readily using the existing techniques for i.i.d .",
    "mimo channels .",

    "a lower bound for the user ergodic rate was obtained for the special scenario in which users at fixed and symmetric set of locations in different cells are served .",
    "this symmetry causes the users to be _ statistically equivalent _ , i.e. , they experience the same set of pathloss values to all the bss , which simplifies the ergodic rate analysis  @xcite . in practice , however , users are usually placed in asymmetric locations , which makes the ergodic rate analysis challenging .      in this paper ,",
    "our main aim is to design a practical multicell cooperation strategy that exploits both horizontal and vertical planes of the wireless channel to reduce the complexity and signaling requirements of network mimo , while achieving comparable performance .",
    "note that , in our previous work  @xcite , we studied the adaptive multicell 3d beamforming in a small - cell network under perfect csi assumption .",
    "in contrast , in this paper , we focus on a more practical case of imperfect csi , which includes the previous work  @xcite as a special case .",

    "[ fig : lincell ] under cell - specific tilting . in this tilting strategy",
    "the applied tilts at the bss are fixed at all times and does not adapt to the particular locations of users .",
    "such tilts are usually found by maximizing some desired statistical performance metric which is independent of the particular realization of the users locations .",
    "adapting the tilt to the locations of the users , commonly referred to as _ user - specific tilting _ , can potentially outperform cell - specific tilting  @xcite .",
    "user - specific tilting , however , requires knowledge about users locations ( e.g. , vertical angles ) , which is difficult to obtain . in this paper , we only focus on cell - specific tilting and leave the study of user - specific tilting to future work .",
    "one popular approach for finding optimum tilts is the so - called _ throughput analysis _  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "three different performance metrics are used , namely the _ edge _ throughput , _ average _ throughput , and _ peak _ throughput defined respectively as the 5-percentile , 50-percentile , and 95-percentile of the throughput cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) over the cell area .",
    "the throughput distribution for any given tilt is obtained by sampling the coverage area using a fine grid of user locations and computing the user throughput at each location by employing the analytical expressions derived in the previous section .",
    "we let our simulation parameters follow those in section  [ sec : numexp ] .",
    "the main simulation assumptions are summarized in table  [ table : simass ] .",
    "because of the symmetry in the considered network , we expect the optimal tilts for all bss to be the same . therefore , to reduce the search space we only consider the case where all bss apply the same tilt , i.e. , @xmath179 .",
    "we consider each transmission mode ( i.e. , cst or nmt ) separately and save the throughput distributions for different values of @xmath180 .",
    "we then use these throughput distributions to plot the edge , average , and peak throughput versus tilt as shown respectively in figures  [ fig : edgethr ] ,  [ fig : avethr ] , and  [ fig : peakthr ] .",
    ".main simulation assumptions [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     [ table : simass ]    as can be seen in fig",
    ".  [ fig : edgethr ] , the maximum edge throughput is attained at @xmath181 for cst and @xmath182 for nmt .",
    "the edge throughput is mainly determined by users close to the cell edge .",
    "therefore , to maximize the throughput of these users , the peak of the beam should be pointed more towards the edge of the cell . moreover , we observe that the edge throughput at optimum tilt is significantly improved ( by about @xmath183 ) in nmt compared to cst , showing that nmt is the best of the two transmission modes for edge throughput maximization .    the maximum average throughput is attained at @xmath184 for cst , while it is reached at @xmath181 for nmt as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : avethr ] . the larger tilt in cst",
    "is required to suppress the ici , which is non - existent in nmt .",
    "when each transmission mode is operating at its optimum tilt , we observe that nmt improves the average throughput by @xmath185 compared to cst .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : avethr ] , we observe two peaks on the curves related to nmt . the first peak ( on the left ) occurs at a smaller tilt and corresponds to the scenario where there is an overlap among the main beams from all the bss . in this case , users in the middle of each cell are not necessarily close to the peak of the main beam of any of the bss .",
    "these users receive a significant part of their desired signal power from the neighboring bss .",
    "the second peak ( on the right ) takes place at a larger tilt and relates to the case where the main beam from each bs is inside its own cell and is pointing directly to the users in the middle of the cell .",
    "such users are close to the peak of the main beam of their home bs , and hence receive a major part of their desired signal from that bs .",
    "interestingly , the second peak is larger than the first one , which shows the importance of tilt optimization in achieving the maximum performance gain in network mimo .",
    "[ c][b][0.8]tilt ( degree ) [ c][t][0.8]edge throughput [ bps / hz ]     [ c][b][0.8]tilt ( degree ) [ c][t][0.8]average throughput [ bps / hz ]     [ c][b][0.8]tilt ( degree ) [ c][t][0.8]peak throughput [ bps / hz ]     the peak throughput is usually attained by users close to the bs .",
    "so we expect the maximizing tilt for peak throughput to be larger than that for average throughput .",
    "this is verified in fig .",
    "[ fig : peakthr ] , where we see that the optimum tilt for both cst and nmt is @xmath186 .",
    "interestingly , the peak throughput performance of cst is almost the same as that of nmt for a tilt greater than @xmath187 .",
    "we note that the allocated power to each user is the same in both cst and nmt .",
    "in addition , large tilt already provides enough protection against ici for users close to the bs .",
    "hence , it seems that serving such a user with a given power from the closest bs with the strongest channel in the presence of sufficiently suppressed ici performs equally good as serving it with the same power from multiple geographically bss with disparate channel strengths .",
    "notice that figures  [ fig : edgethr ] ,  [ fig : avethr ] , and  [ fig : peakthr ] have been plotted assuming @xmath188 users per cell .",
    "this choice is motivated by the results in  @xcite indicating that the number of users per cell for multiuser mimo transmission should be less than @xmath12 in the presence of imperfect csi .",
    "our results from separate simulations , however , show that the number of users has a negligible effect on the optimum tilts for different performance metrics .",
    "these results are omitted here due to space limitations .",
    "one important highlight here is that with cell - specific tilting , it is not possible to optimize all the performance metrics , i.e. , edge , average , and peak throughput , at the same time as each of these metrics is maximized at a different tilt .",
    "one low - complexity solution to address this issue is switched - beam tilting in which at each time - slot one out of a set of finite tilts is applied at the bss to increase the received signal power at a specific region in the desired cell , suppress the ici at certain regions in the neighboring cells , or a combination thereof . in the next section , we exploit the idea of switched - beam tilting and propose a novel transmission strategy that is capable of achieving a _ tradeoff _ in maximizing all performance metrics simultaneously .",
    "in the previous section , nmt was shown to be the best transmission mode for edge throughput maximization .",
    "furthermore , the peak throughput performance of cst was shown to be almost as good as nmt for tilts greater than some threshold ( @xmath187 for the considered scenario ) . for average throughput",
    ", we observed that nmt has moderate superiority over cst .",
    "the aforementioned argument eventually leads to the following hypothesis : a multicell cooperation strategy that would serve the users in different regions of the cell , namely , the cell - interior region or the cell - edge region , with an appropriate transmission mode , i.e. , cst or nmt , and a corresponding appropriate tilt could potentially achieve a tradeoff in maximizing all the performance metrics simultaneously .",
    "hence , we propose a hybrid multicell cooperation strategy , denoted as _ adaptive multicell 3d beamforming _",
    ", with the following components :    1 .   a division of the coverage area in fig .",
    "[ fig : lincell ] into two disjoint _ vertical regions _ as follows : i ) a cell - interior region that consists of three disjoint vertical regions each associated with one of the bss .",
    "the vertical region in cell @xmath13 is obtained as the intersection of the coverage area with a circle of radius @xmath189 centered at bs @xmath13 ; ii ) a cell - edge region that is shared among all bss and is obtained by removing the cell - interior region from the coverage area .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : hybmod ] .",
    "2 .   a transmission technique that at each time - slot serves either the cell - interior region using cst or the cell - edge region using nmt .",
    "we emphasize that only one of these transmission modes can be active at each time - slot .",
    "a switched - beam tilting strategy is also employed that applies at each bs @xmath13 , @xmath72 , a fixed tilt @xmath190 when serving the cell - interior region ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hybmodcbt ] ) , or a fixed tilt @xmath191 when serving the cell - edge region ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : hybmodnmt ] ) . in line with the definition of cell - specific tilting , we denote this switched - beam tilting strategy as _ region - specific tilting _ , as the tilts applied at the bss to serve each region are independent of the particular locations of the users in that region .",
    "3 .   a scheduler to share the available time - slots between the cell - interior region and the cell - edge region .",
    "we define the cell - interior region activity factor @xmath192 ( @xmath193 ) as the fraction of the total time - slots in which the cell - interior region is served .",
    "similarly , @xmath194 ( @xmath195 ) is the cell - edge region activity factor such that @xmath196 .",
    "the parameters @xmath192 and @xmath194 depend , for any realization of users locations , on the number of users in each region and hence are denoted as _ user - specific _ parameters .",
    "[ rem : rem1 ] we highlight that the proposed adaptive multicell 3d beamforming contains different elements of coordination among the bss . for example , the bss need to _ coordinatively _ serve the same vertical region at each time slot , i.e. , either the cell - interior region or the cell - edge region .",
    "in addition , in cst , bss exploit the vertical plane of the wireless channel to perform ici suppression as well as throughput optimization via _ coordinatively _ applying sufficiently large tilts .",
    "each bs , however , uses the horizontal plane independently for multiuser mimo transmission within the vertical region in its own cell . in nmt ,",

    "therefore , we expect the edge and peak throughput performance to be at a satisfactory level for appropriate choices of @xmath197 that would maximize the average throughput .    without loss of generality , we focus on the symmetric network in fig .",

    "if @xmath199 becomes too small , most of the users in the interior part of the cell are served using nmt .",
    "since @xmath201 is set so that the peak of the beam is pointing more towards the cell - edge , many of these users are close to the side - lobe of the antenna beam .",
    "such users could potentially achieve a higher throughput if they were served by cst with @xmath203 . in that case , they would be both closer to the peak of the beam of their home bs and very well protected against ici ( see fig .",

    "one way to suppress such interference would be to multiplex the time - slots allocated to serve the cell - interior region and cell - edge region across neighboring clusters such that for each bs in @xmath245 and its two adjacent bss in the neighboring clusters , at least one will serve a different vertical region ( i.e. , cell - interior region or cell - edge region ) than the others .",
    "moreover , because csi sharing among adjacent bss does not incur extra backhaul usage , another way to suppress the out - of - cluster interference from this group would be via some form of coordinated beamforming among each bs in @xmath245 and its two adjacent bss in the neighboring clusters .",
    "the second group consists of all other bss in @xmath246 to @xmath253 .",
    "these bss are located at a distance larger than @xmath254 from the users in @xmath245 and generate out - of - cluster interference mostly through their main lobes .",
    "the interference from this group might be significant only when they serve the cell - edge regions in their corresponding cluster using @xmath201 .",
    "thanks to the directivity of the antenna patterns and the small vertical hpbw , in networks with a dense deployment of bss , such interference can be significantly suppressed by e.g. , slightly increasing @xmath201 . note that when these group of bss serve the cell - interior region of their corresponding clusters , sufficient out - of - cluster interference mitigation is achieved via using @xmath255 .",
    "we finally highlight that there are also other clustering techniques , such as semi - static clustering  @xcite , dynamic clustering@xcite , and hierarchical clustering  @xcite among others , that provide more flexibility to deal with out - of - cluster interference .",
    "the tradeoffs between different techniques are complicated by the need for more csi training and feedback overhead , and additional backhaul signaling .",
    "detailed investigation of these approaches is left to future work .",
    "in this paper , we investigated downlink transmission in a cellular network with small number of cells that employs two well - known transmission modes , namely , conventional single - cell transmission and fully cooperative multicell transmission denoted as network mimo . to facilitate a computationally efficient analysis , we proposed a novel method for approximating the non - i.i.d .",
    "network mimo channel with an equivalent i.i.d .",
    "mimo channel .",
    "we used this method to derive an accurate analytical expression for the user ergodic rate under network mimo transmission with imperfect csi .",
    "we then considered directional antennas with vertically adjustable beams at the bss and studied cell - specific tilting for the two transmission modes separately .",
    "our results showed that upon applying sufficiently large tilts at the bss , the two transmission modes have similar performance in regions close to the bss .",
    "in fact , with sufficient interference isolation provided by applying large tilts , receiving a given desired signal power from the closest bs with the strongest channel seems to perform as good as receiving it from multiple geographically distributed bss with disparate channel strengths . using this conclusion",
    ", we proposed an adaptive multicell 3d beamforming technique that adaptively exploits the horizontal and vertical planes of the wireless channel for interference management as well as throughput optimization .",
    "the proposed technique divides the coverage area into two vertical regions and adapt the multicell cooperation strategy , including the transmission mode and beamforming strategy at the bss , when serving each region .",
    "numerical results showed the superiority of the proposed technique over the uncoordinated conventional single - cell transmission .",
    "the proposed technique also seems to provide a superior performance - complexity tradeoff compared to network mimo transmission .",
    "finally , we presented possible approaches to employ the proposed adaptive multicell 3d beamforming in networks with a large number of cells .",
    "in this appendix , we provide some well - known lemmas that prove useful in the analyses in sections  [ sec : eiid ] and  [ sec : ergrate ] .",
