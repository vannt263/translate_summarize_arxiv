    "the interplay between doping and antiferromagnetism is believed to play an important role in high @xmath2 superconductors .",
    "hence the motion of holes in an antiferromagnetic background has received much attention in the last two decades .",
    "after the pioneering work of brinkman and rice @xcite , where the hubbard model with @xmath3 is considered , many publications on this subject are known @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . often this problem is faced by applying the model t - j hamiltonian , acting on the space with no doubly occupied sites , which is obtained from the hubbard large u model .",
    "one may use , for instance , the holstein - primakoff transformation ( see @xcite ) to rewrite the hamiltonian it terms of interacting spinless holes and spin waves in order to make it similar to that of the polaron problem . then in the self - consistent born approximation the selfenergy may be calculated ( @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath4 and the result is an integral equation for the green s function of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 contains information about the coupling of the holes to the spin excitations and is of the order of @xmath7 , @xmath8 being the hopping rate of the hole ; @xmath9 is the energy of the spin excitations , which is of order of @xmath0 , the antiferromagnetic exchange energy .",
    "this self - consistent integral equation contains all the information about the hole spectrum ; numerical analysis has shown , that it consists of a broad band of incoherent states and near to its bottom - a peak in the density of states ( dos ) , corresponding to a quasiparticle state ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "it is often claimed that the @xmath10-dependence is not too important @xcite , @xcite .",
    "then it is worth to analyze thoroughly the @xmath10-independent case ( the ising limit ) , when ( [ integr ] ) take a simpler form : @xmath11 ( we have absorbed a factor @xmath12 ( the coordination number ) into @xmath7 )    this functional equation ( [ gg ] ) is investigated in the literature in relation with the polaron problem @xcite , @xcite , the problem of the hole motion , described above , but also in other physical problems .",
    "we mention another example here - the one - dimensional anisotropic ferromagnetic chain , which is studied in relation with experiments on the magnetic salt @xmath13 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the resulting dos consists of a series of sharp delta functions , as shown i.e in @xcite by numerical calculations .",
    "this picture is in contrast with the smooth dos of an incoherent band for @xmath14 found in @xcite and it is not clear how the limit @xmath1 can be obtained .    in order to understand the behavior of the system it is useful to realize , that the motion of the hole creates `` strings '' of overturned spins",
    "; their field confine the hole , thus leading to selftrapped states centered at the original hole position@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    here",
    "we present an approximated treatment of eq .",
    "( [ gg ] ) suitable for small values of @xmath0 and which allows us to consider the limit @xmath15 .",
    "we transform the functional equation into a differential equation and we show that the solutions of the latter present a picture of the dos in agreement with the existing numerical calculations .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we discuss the existing solutions of eq .",
    "( [ gg ] ) , taking as a model the investigations on magnetic salts .",
    "then we transform the functional equation into a differential equation and we solve it . at the end",
    "we analyze the resulting dos and outline the changes induced by the interaction @xmath0 .",
    "we show that our solutions are in line with the previous calculations .",
    "in order to outline the simplicity of the method , proposed here , we first recall the exact solution , following in the main the calculation for the case of magnetic salts .",
    "@xcite , @xcite .",
    "first of all notice that the functional equation ( [ gg ] ) is equivalent to the continued fraction : @xmath16 which in turn can be thought of as solution of the series of difference equations : @xmath17 for n = 0 , 1 , 2 , . .",
    "indeed , from ( [ coupled ] ) one obtains @xmath18 the spectrum may be found from the boundary condition @xmath19 .",
    "compare now to the case of magnetic salts @xcite .",
    "the heisenberg hamiltonian with a magnetic field @xmath20 is simplified to reflect the main properties of the system .",
    "so , one starts from the eigenstates of the ising : @xmath21 which consist of single clusters of @xmath22-adjacent spin deviations with respect to the ferromagnetic ground state , with selfenergies @xmath23 and constructs bloch functions .",
    "in this basis is calculated the perturbation due to the anisotropic term , which is the most important in the case of ferromagnetic salts : @xmath24 for the coefficients in the perturbation series one obtains the same type of coupled equations as ( [ coupled ] ) the only difference being due to the fact , that the perturbation @xmath25 couples states with spin deviation differing by 2 @xcite :    @xmath26 with @xmath27 - the interatomic distance and @xmath28 .",
    "the correspondence between the two cases , discussed above , can be expressed as follows : @xmath29    for the simplest case @xmath14 ( or in the absence of magnetic field , when one considers the magnetic salts ) ( [ coupled ] ) may be solved taking @xmath30 .",
    "the `` transfer matrix '' @xmath31 obeys the equation : @xmath32 and we have @xmath33 we obtain continuous spectrum in the region @xmath34 .",
    "this corresponds to the semispherical dos found in @xcite .",
    "let us put @xmath35 , where @xmath36 .",
    "for @xmath31 we have two solutions : @xmath37 , from which we can construct the expressions for @xmath38 , corresponding to the appropriate boundary condition : @xmath39 .",
    "now , let us consider the solution of ( [ coupled ] ) in the general case .",
    "when we realize that the same recurrence relation satisfy the bessel s functions , we can write this solution at once : @xmath40 the boundary condition is then @xmath41 the spectrum can be found as the zeros of the bessel functions are tabulated ( see i.e. @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible to obtain more transparent expressions using the appropriate double asymptotic expansion of the bessel function in both order and argument @xcite , @xcite : @xmath42\\ , , + o(\\mu^{-1/5 } ) } \\ ] ] where @xmath43 .    setting @xmath35 as earlier",
    ", we have @xmath44 i.e @xmath45 and the zeros of the bessel functions can be calculated from the condition : @xmath46 where @xmath47 . from this formula",
    "the spectrum can be calculated numerically .",
    "another type of approximation to the recurrence equation([coupled ] ) consists of considering the coefficients @xmath38 as slowly varying functions of @xmath22 , which is justified in the limit of large @xmath22 and is on the same lines as the calculation in @xcite .",
    "replacing @xmath38 by a continuous function @xmath48 and expanding @xmath49 about @xmath22 , we obtain the following equation : @xmath50 which may be regarded as a one dimensional schrdinger equation , describing the motion of a particle of mass @xmath51 in the linear ( `` wedge '' ) potential @xmath52 . the boundary condition @xmath53 is equivalent to the introduction of an infinite potential wall .",
    "this problem is well known to yield solutions in terms of airy - functions . in wkb approximation",
    "the bohr - sommerfeld condition reads : @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 and one obtains the spectrum @xmath57    the spectrum , found here , consisting of discrete levels , should merge to form a continuous band , when @xmath1 .",
    "but this fact can not be expressed analytically , the limit @xmath1 being singular .",
    "let us write the equation for the self - energy , corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ gg ] ) : @xmath58    for small @xmath0 we can expand the function @xmath59 : @xmath60 } \\",
    ", , \\ ] ] or @xmath61 when @xmath14 the resulting equation @xmath62 has the well known solution @xmath63 which gives a semispherical density of states ( dos ) in the region @xmath64 .",
    "the differential equation ( [ sec ] ) can not be integrated analytically . nor is it possible to treat the terms @xmath65 as a perturbation ; so , in order to find an appropriate solution we proceed as follows :    we will transform first ( [ sec ] ) into a higher order equation , @xmath66 having in mind , that only part of the solutions of the latter are also solutions of ( [ sec ] ) . then we have to choose the integration constants as to reproduce the correct result for the equation of lower order .",
    "we are interested in the solution for the energy region of the quasi - band states , as we want to know how the dos , generated from ( [ sigma ] ) , changes , when one includes a small interaction @xmath0 .",
    "we look for a solution , which is sufficiently smooth .",
    "so we neglect the terms @xmath67 and obtain the following equation ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) : @xmath70 we believe this equation contains the essential part of the information needed to analyse the change of the dos in the band . in the * appendix * we outline the main steps of the calculation .",
    "the solution is obtained in parametric form : @xmath71 @xmath72 where @xmath73 is an integration constant . in order to reproduce the known results without @xmath0 , we have to choose @xmath74 .",
    "indeed , let us take @xmath14 , we have then : @xmath75 whereby , getting off the parameter @xmath76 , we obtain the direct relation between @xmath77 and @xmath78 : @xmath79 and we have again ( [ sigma ] ) .",
    "another useful relation reads @xmath80.\\ ] ] ( the sign is to be chosen properly , as to reproduce at @xmath1 the starting equation @xmath81 ) .",
    "the next step is to transform these relations in some formulae , which enables us to analyze the change in the dos under the influence of @xmath0 .",
    "we rewrite the second equation in ( [ xy ] ) in the form : @xmath82 where @xmath83 ( remember , that @xmath84 ) .",
    "then we introduce a parameter @xmath85 : @xmath86 and find , making use of ( [ use ] ) :    @xmath87 ^ 2}{q(4+q)}+2jx + j^2 }   \\right ] =   \\frac 1 2 \\left [ \\tilde{x } \\left(1 + \\sqrt\\frac{4+q}q \\right ) + \\frac j 2 \\left(1+\\sqrt\\frac q{4+q}\\right ) \\right]\\ ] ] then the parameter @xmath88 is obtained from the equation @xmath89 and the solution for @xmath78 is : @xmath90    it is clear , that the band width is now determined by the value of @xmath91 , which is function of @xmath77 to be calculated from ( [ tt ] ) .",
    "this transcendental equation can be solved numerically , but several properties may be revealed by analytical study of the results .",
    "we will still use for convenience the variable @xmath92 ( a shifted energy ) . from ( [ y - x ] )",
    "we have the self - energy @xmath93 and we can calculate the green s function @xmath94 in terms of the parameter @xmath95 : @xmath96 the parameter @xmath95 plays in this formula a role similar to that of the hopping rate @xmath8 in the absence of the interaction @xmath0 . in the latter case",
    "@xmath8 determines the width of the incoherent band ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "now @xmath95 depends on @xmath98 ( on the energy ) and it is not obvious how the band width changes .    the relation to determine @xmath95 ( [ tt ] ) may be rewritten in the form @xmath99 so , the function @xmath100 can be found graphically using the plot of @xmath101 ( figure [ fig ] ) .",
    "+    first we consider the region above the top of the band . for high energies ( large @xmath102 ) solution is obtained from the curve @xmath103 above the jump at @xmath104 and we have @xmath105 . the physically meaningful solution for @xmath100",
    "is obtained on the left branch of the curve , where @xmath106 as @xmath107 .",
    "once @xmath95 is known , one can calculate the green s function . in this region of @xmath108",
    "our solution satisfies @xmath109 and @xmath110 is real .",
    "we may use the following expression for it : @xmath111    the function@xmath103 - ( [ t - x ] ) - has a minimum in this region and the corresponding value of @xmath112 is to be evaluated from the relation : @xmath113    below the minimum of @xmath114 real solutions of the transcendental equation ( [ t - x ] ) do not exist , so it represents the upper limit ( the top ) of the band .",

    "we have to calculate the complex @xmath125 and then find the complex green s function which gives the spectral function ( and the dos in the band ) . from ( [ t - x ] )",
    "we obtain the following system for the real and imaginary part of @xmath95 : @xmath126 @xmath127 where the following notations are used : @xmath128 in terms of these variables we may write the green s function in the form : @xmath129\\left[{\\displaystyle 1- \\frac{2\\eta}{sin(2\\eta)}\\cosh(\\xi - i \\eta)}\\right ] } \\ , .\\ ] ]    we study analytically @xmath110 in the center of the unperturbed band ( @xmath130 ) and in its vicinity . for @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",

    "consider now the negative values of the energy ( of @xmath108 ) . at @xmath141",
    "we find again @xmath142 , but @xmath143 ( on the left side of the jump of the function @xmath103 ) , as it is expected .",
    "the ratio @xmath144 , so we have real values of the green s function and we are outside the band .    on the other hand , as @xmath145 for @xmath146 , we see from ( [ greal ] ) that the green\"s function has a pole .",
    "hence , we obtain a quasi - particle state .",
    "the corresponding energy is calculated from the condition : @xmath147 and making use of ( [ t - x ] ) : @xmath148 we find @xmath149 for the energy of the quasiparticle level . the calculated energies @xmath150 of this level for 3 different values of the parameter @xmath0 are given in table 1 .    for negative energy smaller in absolute value",
    "we arrive at the point , where the condition @xmath151 is satisfied .",
    "( for small @xmath0 this point is just next to the quasiparticle level ) .",
    "the latter condition is the bound of the real values of @xmath152 .",
    "so , we are at the lower limit ( the bottom ) of the band .",
    "we developed here a different method for solving the functional equation ( [ gg ] ) by transforming it into a differential equation .",
    "this approach may be useful when the exchange interaction @xmath0 is not large . under this approximation",
    "the region of sharp peaks in the dos merge into a smooth band .",

    "also a bound level ( quasiparticle state ) immediately under the incoherent band is found , in agreement with previous numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "so we have a picture of the dos , which is very close to that known from the literature .",
    "we also obtained an explicit expression for the green s function near the center of the band .",
