    "the majority of iron - based superconductors ( ibs ) have a region of coexisting superconductivity and long - range magnetic order ( lrmo ) in their temperature - composition phase diagram , usually at low doping levels .",
    "whereas this leads to some very interesting physics @xcite , it complicates the analysis of the superconducting gap structure @xcite .",
    "fese , on the other hand , only exhibits a structural transition around @xmath10 90 k , but no lrmo at the ambient pressure @xcite .",
    "being a nearly stoichiometric compound with relatively simple electronic band structure @xcite , fese offers a unique opportunity to study iron - based superconductivity without complications of lrmo and elevated scattering , which is always significant in charge - doped compounds @xcite .",
    "the temperature - pressure phase diagram of fese is quite non - trivial .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath1 , is non - monotonic ,  increasing initially up to 0.8 gpa , then decreasing , reaching a minimum at 1.3 gpa and increasing again @xcite . despite the absence of lrmo , a strong nematic response",
    "is found in fese , and has been discussed in terms of both spin and orbital fluctuations@xcite .",
    "additional interest in this material stems from the discovery of high temperature superconductivity with @xmath11 65 k in a single - layer fese grown on a srtio@xmath12 @xcite , as well as the intriguing possibility of being in the regime of a crossover from bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) and bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) coupling due to small fermi energies comparable to superconducting gap values @xcite .",

    "was studied by measuring the low - temperature variation of the london penetration depth , @xmath14 , before and after 2.5 mev electron irradiation . using power - law fitting , @xmath15 , ( @xmath16 ) , we find that the exponent @xmath17 is much greater than the terminal dirty - limit value of 2 in all samples , signaling a nodeless gap .",
    "irradiated samples show an even larger @xmath17 , extending up to a higher temperature of the fitting range . moreover , bcs - like fitting with gap magnitude as free parameter clearly shows an increase of the gap minimum upon introduction of point - like disorder .",
    "both results are consistent with the smearing of the anisotropic part of the gap .",
    "surprisingly , after @xmath18 @xmath19/@xmath13 2.5 mev electron irradiation , @xmath1 has _ increased _ by 0.4 k from 8.8 k , while @xmath3 decreased by 0.9 k from 91.2 k. these opposite trends are similar to the effect of pressure @xcite and also imply that pair - breaking due to non - magnetic disorder is quite small .",
    "overall , our results are consistent with highly anisotropic superconducting gap , which may have accidental nodes in the clean limit . while we can not distinguish between generalized @xmath7  and highly anisotropic multiband @xmath8 pairing , we can limit the former to the case where intra - band pairing dominates the inter - band pairing .    throughout the paper",
    ", we use the following terminology for multiband pairing : @xmath8  is when the superconducting order parameters are of the same sign on different bands , and @xmath7  when some are of the opposite sign . for the latter we distinguish between the case of dominant intraband pairing vs. dominant interband pairing , since these two cases respond very differently to nonmagnetic disorder . for a 2 - band system with interaction",
    "potential @xmath20 , the former is realized when @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are intraband , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are inter - band pairing potentials and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the normalized partial densities of state ( dos ) on two bands and @xmath28 is the total dos @xcite .",

    "it is important to note that even when @xmath30 , the order parameters will have opposite signs and , thus , this is an @xmath7  pairing state .",
    "finally , we note that the term s - wave pairing used throughout this paper refers to the state that has the full symmetry of the lattice just above the superconducting transition . in the case of fese , this is @xmath31 rather than @xmath32 due to the strong nematic symmetry breaking that occurs at the structural transition , and the fermi surface that drives the superconducting gap function is strongly @xmath31 symmetric according to arpes . in terms of the harmonics of the tetragonal system , such a state would be described as an @xmath33 state",

    "we analyze its behavior using two approaches .",
    "first , following our previous studies @xcite , we fit the london penetration depth by the power - law , @xmath56 .",
    "the solid black curve , indicated by an arrow in fig .  [ fig2 ] , shows an example of such a fit .",
    "we examine the dependence of the exponent @xmath17 on the upper limit of the fitting range , @xmath57 , which was varied from 0.05 @xmath1 to 0.3 @xmath1 while the lower - limit was fixed as a base temperature of about 50 mk .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows how the exponent @xmath17 increases with the decrease of @xmath57 reaching the values significantly greater than 2 below 0.1@xmath1 .",
    "this indicates the presence of a small but finite gap , because both accidental and symmetry - imposed line nodes result in @xmath58 . as discussed above , sts experiments on high quality samples",
    "reported evidence for gap nodes in thin films @xcite and single crystals @xcite , and from the theoretical standpoint , a ground state with very shallow @xmath31-symmetric nodes was found within spin fluctuation calculations with orbital ordering@xcite , both in apparent contrast to our small gap result .",
    "however , we know that accidental nodes can be lifted by intraband disorder scattering@xcite",
    ". it may therefore be that our samples are slightly more disordered than those that show nodes .",
    "a similar suggestion was made in recent work on thermal conductivity @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that samples of fese differ from one another not because of small differences in defect concentrations , but due to different concentrations of twin boundaries due to growth conditions .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have shown that even the bulk crystals exhibiting a nodal state show large scale regions of full gap behavior in the neighborhood of twin boundaries .",
    "depending on its irregularity , the twin boundary may act a pair breaker , in which case this effect may be simply another version of the disorder node lifting phenomenon . the long range nature of the effect@xcite suggests , however , that other physics may be in play . at present",
    "we can not make convincing statements about the origin of our small gaps , but it appears clear that the gap is sensitive to small perturbations , which can gap a nodal state , and at present the most natural explanation seems to be that disorder is lifting the nodes in slightly less pure samples .    , of power - law fitting for data shown in fig .",
    "x - axis is the upper - limit of the fitting range . in all samples ,",
    "the exponents increase well above dirty - limit of @xmath592 at low - temperatures , indicating the presence of small , but finite superconducting gap .",
    "after electron irradiation , @xmath17 becomes even higher , probably signaling some reduction of the gap anisotropy .",
    "the @xmath46 axis direction is also gapped.,width=302 ]    our second approach to analyze low - temperature behavior is to use bcs single gap fit , @xmath60 with variable upper temperature limit , @xmath57 , free parameters @xmath61 and @xmath31 , and the value of the gap , @xmath62 also as a free parameter .",

    "figure  [ fig4](b ) presents the ratio of @xmath63 obtained as the best fit parameter for several values of the upper limit of the fitting range .",
    "while there is only a hint of saturation in the pristine curve , the irradiated fits saturate at about @xmath64 indicating a truly exponential behavior .",
    "in addition , we see that the smaller range fits indicate clearly that the minimum gap has increased upon irradiation , a phenomenon analogous to node lifting , which results from the averaging of the gap anisotropy by intraband disorder@xcite .",
    "this is only possible if the anisotropy , and possible nodes , are not imposed by the pairing potential symmetry ( i.e. , anisotropic @xmath65 wave or @xmath7 , but not @xmath66wave ) .     and example of bcs - like fitting of data for sample b for @xmath670.08 before ( lower curve ) and after 1.8 c/@xmath13  electron irradiation ( upper curve ) . also shown an equation and definitions used .",

[ fig5 ] , the superfluid density @xmath71 is plotted with @xmath72 400 nm obtained from microwave cavity perturbation measurements of similar fese crystals @xcite and with @xmath72 330 nm , obtained from the best fit to the anisotropic order parameter described in the following paragraph .",

    "note that both are normalized arbitrarily to 1 at @xmath40 . while it is clear that electron irradiation results in a suppressed superfluid density at all temperatures , we can not make more rigorous conclusions , because @xmath70 definitely increases with disorder , but at the moment we do not know how much .    to describe the data over the whole temperature range , we discuss fits using a single anisotropic order parameter , as well as two isotropic gaps .",
    "neither is really appropriate for a multiband , anisotropic superconductor , but these analyses can give some sense of what properties the true gap function must display . in order to analyze the data with an anisotropic order parameter with the possibility of both gapped and nodal states",

    "all consistent with pairbreaking in an anisotropic @xmath91-wave state  with the remarkable fact that @xmath1 _ increases _ with irradiation .",
    "note that there are several examples in the literature where irradiation  for example by heavy ions",
    " produces essentially no change in @xmath1 .",
    "these effects have been understood in terms of mesoscopic inhomogeneity , in contrast to the spatially uniform disorder produced at the nanoscale by electron irradiation . in pnictides , however , e.g. the bafe@xmath9as@xmath9-based ",
    "ba122 `` compounds , @xmath1 is suppressed fairly rapidly by 2.5 mev electron irradiation @xcite .",
    "for example , in bafe@xmath9(as@xmath92p@xmath93)@xmath9 , essentially the same irradiation dosage applied in this work produced a suppression of 5% of @xmath1 , whereas in fese @xmath1 increases by about the same amount .",
    "this effect is therefore qualitatively different .",
    "some aspects of the defects created by electron irradiation in this system are therefore not consistent with a purely pairbreaking interpretation , but may effectively dope the system , exert chemical pressure , or by some other means enhance the pairing interaction ( ' ' _ pair strengthening _ \" ) . another possibility is if superconductivity in fese is competing with a secondary order that is suppressed more rapidly by disorder than superconductivity itself ; this is analogous to the mechanism proposed for enhancement of @xmath1 by disorder in the spin density wave phase of the ba(fe@xmath94co@xmath95)@xmath9as@xmath9 system @xcite by fernandes _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .    assuming that whatever effect leads to @xmath1 enhancement is rather small , one may ask , how is it able to overcome the pairbreaking effect of disorder ?",
    "there are several situations in which pairbreaking , even in a highly anisotropic superconductor , is fairly minimal .",
    "the first example is a conventional non - sign - changing  @xmath8 \" superconductor , where nonmagnetic disorder is pairbreaking only to the extent that it averages the gap anisotropy @xcite .",
    "this seems unlikely simply because the electronic interactions and fermi surface of fese are so similar to the fe - pnictides , where there is considerable experimental evidence and theoretical justification for an @xmath96 identification@xcite .",
    "the second is an  intraband \" @xmath96 superconductor , which behaves nearly equivalently to ",
    "@xmath8 \" in terms of non - magnetic scattering @xcite . here",
    "also , one would have to assume attractive intraband interactions due , presumably , to phonons , leading to a picture quite different from the other systems .",
    "finally , any sort of @xmath96 pairing is fairly insensitive to disorder , at least as insensitive as the corresponding anisotropic @xmath8 state , provided the disorder scattering is primarily intraband in nature .",
    "it seems to us that this latter possibility is likely to be the case .",
    "if we compare to the example given above , of electron irradiated bafe@xmath9(as@xmath92p@xmath93)@xmath9 , then the effect of pair strengthening or competing order would have to be of roughly the same order but a bit larger compared to the ( opposite sign ) effect of disorder pairbreaking .    of the various scenarios considered to enhance @xmath1 , some seem unlikely .",
    "for example , we measured hall coefficient in bak122 crystals of different doping levels and with different doses , and found that that electron irradiation is not doping the system @xcite .",
    "enhancement of @xmath1 by the suppression of competing order by impurity scattering relies on a scenario whereby the competing order is more sensitive to the disorder than the superconductivity itself .",
    "for example , in the case discussed by fernandes _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , @xmath97 stripe order is sensitive to impurity scattering by both @xmath98 and @xmath97 , but isotropic @xmath96 superconductivity is sensitive only to scattering by @xmath97 .    in fese",
    "there appears to be no long range magnetic order , but significant nematic order is present due to weak orthorhombic distortion below structural transition . assuming a competition between the two states appears reasonable because @xmath3 is suppressed and @xmath1 enhanced both under hydrostatic pressure and , more recently , sulfur doping @xcite .",
    "the effect of disorder on these two competing states is however not as straightforward as in the case of @xmath96 superconductivity competing with the @xmath97 spin density wave , both because the nematic state is a form of @xmath98 order , and because the anisotropic superconducting state is sensitive to small @xmath99 as well as large @xmath99 scattering .",
    "however , it can be shown that a @xmath66wave pomeranchuk instability is weakened  by point - like impurity scattering @xcite .",
    "such a suppression of a @xmath66wave pomeranchuk state is also expected in accordance with imry - ma theorem @xcite .",
    "since @xmath66wave pomeranchuk order leads to deformation of the fermi surface , it can strongly suppress superconductivity .",
    "if nematic order in fese is of this general type , we may expect that as it  deteriorates due to disorder , superconductivity will get a boost , which under some circumstances may overcome the pairbreaking damage done by the disorder .",
    "further work is needed to establish this scenario in context of multiband fe - based superconductors .    for completeness , we mention that the nematic phase of fese has been interpreted in terms of various quadrupolar magnetic  hidden \" long range orders@xcite , which may be quite sensitive to disorder .",
    "thus far neither this sensitivity nor the competition with superconductivity has addressed in the literature .",
    "we now consider the possibility that the frenkel pairs created by electron irradiation change the lattice in a way that mimics some kind of chemical pressure , thereby altering the electronic structure and thereby the pairing interaction itself subtly .",
    "one effect of this type is of course actual hydrostatic pressure , where @xmath1 is observed to increase simultaneously with the decrease of @xmath3 , exactly as observed here . on the other hand",
    ", the creation of frenkel defects should expand rather than collapse the lattice .",
    "nevertheless , similar effects have been seen when the lattice is expanded , e.g. , in the fese intercalate family . as pointed out by noji _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , expanding the lattice in the @xmath46 direction in the range of 5 - 9   increases @xmath1 linearly at a rate of about 14 k /  .",
    "fese itself is at the bottom of this lattice constant range .",
    "this trend in the intercalates was reproduced by spin fluctuation theory with the calculated fermi surfaces as input@xcite , and arises crudely due to the increase of the fermi level density of states as @xmath100 increases . on the other hand ,",
    "uniaxial thermal - expansion measurements show , via thermodynamic relations , that @xmath1  is mostly affected by the in - plane lattice parameters , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , and is much less sensitive to the @xmath46axis lattice constant @xcite . in either case ,",
    "our estimates of the average stretch of the @xmath100-axis lattice lattice constant with irradiation provide an effect that is an order of magnitude too small to influence @xmath1 via chemical pressure mechanism compared to the 5% enhancement observed . with our irradiation dose ,",
    "we create approximately 3.6@xmath3410@xmath103 frenkel pairs per unit cell and even most optimistic estimates give a minuscule volume change , @xmath10410@xmath103 , which at best can result in about 0.1 k change of @xmath1 for any optimistic scenario of either expansion of the @xmath46axis @xcite or hydrostatic pressure .",
    "furthermore , upon warming up to room temperature about 30 % of frenkel pairs recombine as was directly determined from _ in - situ _ resistivity measurements @xcite and it is also believed that most interstitials will migrate from sample interior to surfaces , dislocations and other  sinks \" in the crystal @xcite .",
    "this will make the above estimates even lower and we may safely conclude that pressure due to electron irradiation can not explain our results .",
    "this leaves us with the very plausible possibility that the impurity is pair strengthening , i.e. that it enhances the pair interaction locally , as discussed in several microscopic models @xcite . here",
    "the basic idea is that the electronic structure is modulated locally so that it enhances the magnetic exchange in the strong coupling limit , or drives the system closer to a local stoner instability , in the weak coupling case .",
    "note that the impurity can at the same time possess an electrostatic potential component that is itself pair breaking ; the competition between these two effects decides whether @xmath1 is enhanced locally or not . as discussed in _ supplementary information _",
    ", for the concentration of defects estimated in our irradiated sample , the defects are on the average well within a coherence length of one another , so there is a percolating superconducting path at the enhanced tc , such that it can be detected in transport .",
    "the broadening of the transition by irradiation tends to support an inhomogeneous enhancement of this type .",
    "note that since the above theoretical works considered only hubbard - type 1-band models , considerable further work is necessary to establish the validity of this scenario in the context of the fe - based materials .",
    "the observation of small gaps at low temperatures in some samples may also be due to differences in sample growth , preparation and mounting for measurements that introduce different amounts of strain , and hence result in higher density of twins below the structural transition in some samples .",
    "since twins appear to promote nodeless over nodal behavior@xcite and the effect is long - range , samples with higher twin density may display predominantly nodeless gaps .",
    "it is interesting to note in this context that the difference in resistivity between the nodal samples of kasahara _ et al .",
    "_  and other samples ( ours including ) are mostly visible below the structural transition where twins form @xcite .",
    "we have performed penetration depth measurements down to low temperatures on pristine and electron - irradiated samples of fese . in both samples ,",
    "the low-@xmath90 variation of @xmath105 is consistent with a small minimum gap , which increases from 0.7 k in the pristine sample to 1.3k in the irradiated sample , suggesting the effect of gap averaging by disorder .",
    "there are now reports in the literature claiming both nodal and small full gaps in fese crystals , and it will be important to establish whether the full gap samples are dirtier or cleaner . thus far ,",
