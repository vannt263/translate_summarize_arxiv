    "<S> the critical behaviour of semi - infinite @xmath0-dimensional systems with short - range interactions and an @xmath1 invariant hamiltonian is investigated at an @xmath2-axial lifshitz point with an isotropic wave - vector instability in an @xmath2-dimensional subspace of @xmath3 parallel to the surface . </S>",
    "<S> continuum @xmath4 models representing the associated universality classes of surface critical behaviour are constructed . in the boundary parts of their hamiltonians quadratic derivative terms ( involving a dimensionless coupling constant @xmath5 ) must be included in addition to the familiar ones @xmath6 . beyond one - loop order the infrared - stable fixed points describing the ordinary , special and extraordinary transitions in @xmath7 dimensions ( with @xmath8 ) are located at @xmath9 . at second order in @xmath10 , the surface critical exponents of both the ordinary and the special transitions start to deviate from their @xmath11 analogues . results to order @xmath12 are presented for the surface critical exponent @xmath13 of the ordinary transition . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling dimension of the surface energy density is shown to be given exactly by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the bulk anisotropy exponent .    </S>",
    "<S> lifshitz points , i.e.  multicritical points at which a disordered , a homogeneous ordered , and a modulated ordered phase meet , have been known since the end of the 1970s [ 14 ] . </S>",
    "<S> appropriate @xmath16-vector @xmath4-models representing universality classes of @xmath2-axial lifshitz points were introduced at the same time ; the simplest ones have a hamiltonian @xmath17 with density @xmath18 where the position vector @xmath19 has @xmath2- and @xmath20-dimensional components @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively , @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the corresponding gradients and @xmath25 means the laplacian @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> although the possibility of studying the universality classes of these models in a systematic manner by means of expansions in @xmath0 and @xmath2 about general points on the line of upper critical dimensions @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) had been realized already in 1975 @xcite , the enormous technical difficulties one encounters beyond one - loop order [ 58 ] had prevented a successful implementation of this programme until recently when a full two - loop renormalization group ( rg ) analysis was performed and the @xmath29 expansions of all critical exponents were determined to order @xmath12 [ 913 ] . </S>",
    "<S> here we are concerned with the effects of _ surfaces _ on the critical behaviour at such @xmath2-axial lifshitz points . </S>",
    "<S> the only previous studies of this problem we are aware of are restricted to the uniaxial ( @xmath30 ) ising ( @xmath31 ) case and use either the mean - field approximation [ 1315 ] or monte carlo simulations @xcite for the annni model . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider semi - infinite systems with a boundary plane @xmath32 at @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the cartesian coordinate along the inner normal on @xmath32 . since @xmath21 and @xmath22 scale differently , </S>",
    "<S> two distinct basic orientations of the surface plane exist which we call parallel and perpendicular , depending on whether @xmath35 is orthogonal to the @xmath36 or the @xmath37 subspace . </S>",
    "<S> we restrict ourselves here to the case of parallel surface orientation ; the case of perpendicular orientation requires separate considerations and a distinct analysis @xcite .    for semi - infinite @xmath4 models with an @xmath1 symmetric hamiltonian three distinct types of surface transitions occurring at the bulk critical point can be distinguished @xcite : the ordinary , special and extraordinary transitions . </S>",
    "<S> is sufficiently high so that long - range surface order is possible in the presence of a disordered bulk . ] </S>",
    "<S> analogues of these surface transitions should exist also for the @xmath2-axial bulk lifshitz points described by hamiltonians with the bulk density ( [ eq : ham ] ) ( see footnote ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the uniaxial ising case @xmath38 in @xmath39 dimensions , pleimling s monte carlo results @xcite and the mean field analysis of @xcite lend support to this expectation . </S>",
    "<S> our goal is to pave the ground for systematic field theory analyses of these transitions .    to this end </S>",
    "<S> we need an appropriate semi - infinite extension of the bulk model with the density ( [ eq : ham ] ) . for the short - range interaction case we are concerned with </S>",
    "<S> , it is justified to choose a hamiltonian of the form ( with @xmath40 ) @xmath41 where @xmath42 depends on @xmath43 and its derivatives </S>",
    "<S> . we must now ( i ) find out which contributions have to be retained in @xmath44 , ( ii ) determine the boundary conditions they imply , ( iii ) clarify the renormalization of the field theory and set up a rg approach in @xmath45 dimensions , and ( iv ) derive the fixed - point structure , identifying potential fixed points describing the ordinary , special and extraordinary transitions .    </S>",
    "<S> in the case of a critical point ( corresponding to the choice @xmath11 ) , it is sufficient to include a term @xmath46 in @xmath47 ; other @xmath1 ( or @xmath48 ) invariant contributions can be shown to be redundant or irrelevant @xcite . however , in the ( @xmath49 ) case of a lifshitz point , this is not sufficient ; we must take @xmath50 power counting tells us that @xmath51 is dimensionless . </S>",
    "<S> hence it is scale invariant at the gaussian fixed point and potentially infrared relevant for @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> all other contributions , notably terms @xmath52 , @xmath53 or @xmath54 , can be ruled out by symmetry or shown to be irrelevant or redundant @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the field theory defined by equations ( [ eq : ham])([eq : l1 ] ) satisfies the boundary conditions ( valid in an operator sense @xcite ) @xmath55 this carries over to the free propagator @xmath56 , whose fourier transform , @xmath57 , with respect to the @xmath58 coordinates parallel to the surface reads , in the disordered phase , @xmath59}\\ ] ] with @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the @xmath2-dimensional @xmath36 component of the wave - vector @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> the back transform of the part depending on @xmath63 is the free bulk propagator @xmath64 . at the gaussian lifshitz point @xmath65 </S>",
    "<S> , it takes the scaling form @xmath66 here the scaling function @xmath67 is a generalization of a generalized hypergeometric function ( a fox - wright @xmath68 function , cf equations ( 10)(13 ) of @xcite ) . in the special cases </S>",
    "<S> @xmath69 or @xmath70 at arbitrary @xmath71 , @xmath56 reduces to the neumann or dirichlet propagator , respectively , whose @xmath72 dependent parts reduce to @xmath73 .    </S>",
    "<S> utilizing these results , and employing dimensional regularization in conjunction with minimal subtraction of poles , we have performed a two - loop rg analysis of the model ( 1)(3 ) in @xmath45 dimension .    </S>",
    "<S> its main results are as follows . to renormalize the multi - point correlation functions @xmath74 involving @xmath75 fields @xmath76 off and @xmath77 fields @xmath78 on the boundary , the ` bulk ' re - parameterizations known from @xcite , @xmath79 must be complemented by ` surface ' re - parameterizations of the form @xmath80 where the surface renormalization factors @xmath81 and @xmath82 depend on @xmath83 _ and _ @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> . the function @xmath84 does not vanish at @xmath85 ; although the one - loop coefficient @xmath86 vanishes at @xmath85 , the graph of @xmath87 yields a non - zero @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> thus a contribution @xmath89 to @xmath44 gets generated under the rg even if it was originally absent .    </S>",
    "<S> the fixed points @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 describing respectively the ordinary , special , and extraordinary transitions must lie in the @xmath93 plane at @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the nontrivial root of the bulk beta function @xmath96 , computed to order @xmath97 in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath98 , the beta function @xmath99 turns out to have an infrared - stable root at @xmath100 with a correction - to - scaling exponent @xmath101 thus @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 are the fixed points at @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 displayed in figure [ fig : flow ] .     plane if @xmath105 , showing the fixed points @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 . ]    upon exploiting the rg equations implied by the above re - parameterizations ( [ eq : bulkrep ] ) and ( [ eq : surfrep ] ) in a standard fashion , one concludes that the critical surface exponents of the special transition can be expressed in terms of bulk exponents and @xmath109=(d - m-2+\\eta_{\\rm l2}+\\eta_1^{*,{\\rm        sp}}+m\\theta)/2 = \\beta_1^{\\rm sp}/\\nu_{\\rm l2}\\ ] ] and @xmath110=d - m-2+m\\theta-\\eta_c^{*,{\\rm        sp } } \\;,\\ ] ] the scaling exponents of @xmath111 and the boundary energy density @xmath112 ^ 2/2 $ ] , respectively , where the superscript ` @xmath113 ' means values taken at @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath10 expansions of these exponents , like those of the bulk exponents , turn out to be independent of @xmath2 to order @xmath10 , but can be shown to be @xmath2 dependent at @xmath97 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> results @xmath115 and @xmath116 of @xmath117 and the surface crossover exponent @xmath118 may be gleaned from equations ( 3.156e , b ) of @xcite . ] </S>",
    "<S> these statements about the @xmath2-dependence apply equally well to the surface critical exponents of the ordinary transition . to demonstrate this via explicit @xmath97 results , </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath119 can be expressed quite generally in terms of standard bulk exponents @xmath120 , @xmath121 ( or @xmath122 ) , @xmath123 and a single additional anomalous dimension @xmath124 as @xmath125 our two - loop result for @xmath124 is @xmath126\\big\\}}+\\or{\\big[}{(u^*)}^3\\big]\\;.\\ ] ] here @xmath95 is the fixed - point value whose @xmath10 expansion to @xmath97 is given in equation ( 60 ) of @xcite while @xmath127 , defined by equations ( 49 ) and ( 50 ) of that reference , is one of the four single integrals ( @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 ) in terms of which the two - loop series coefficients of the bulk exponents were written there [ see its equations ( 43)(45 ) and ( 50 ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> finally , @xmath132 is a similar new integral which can be reduced to a single one . </S>",
    "<S> ( upon rewriting @xmath133 as @xmath134 , the latter @xmath135 integration can be performed analytically to obtain a combination of hypergeometric functions . )    combining these results yields @xmath136 + 64\\,(5n+22)\\,j_u(m)\\nonumber\\\\ \\lo + 96(8+n)\\big[j_1(m)-       j_u(m)\\big]\\bigg\\}\\epsilon^2 + \\or(\\epsilon^3)\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    just as for the above - metioned four integrals of @xcite , the values of @xmath137 can be computed analytically for the special choices @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 . </S>",
    "<S> this yields @xmath141 to determine @xmath137 for other values of @xmath2 we had to resort to numerical means of the kind utilized in @xcite . for the uniaxial case @xmath30 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtained @xmath142 . </S>",
    "<S> note also that in the limit @xmath140 , the result ( [ eq : eta1infeps ] ) reduces to the familiar one for the standard semi - infinite @xmath143 model , given in equation ( iv.35 ) of @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us briefly explain how the above results were obtained . </S>",
    "<S> since the fixed point @xmath90 is located at @xmath102 , the ordinary transition can be investigated without having to retain the full dependence on @xmath144 and @xmath5 . to see this , note that the free propagator and the regularized bare @xmath74 become independent of @xmath145 in the limit @xmath146 , and satisfy a dirichlet boundary condition , which carries over to the renormalized theory . </S>",
    "<S> the long - scale behaviour of the @xmath74 with a nonzero number of @xmath147 can be inferred from the theory with @xmath148 and @xmath149 via the near - boundary behaviour of the operator @xmath150 . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , one considers correlation functions involving an arbitrary number of the operators @xmath150 and @xmath151 , and then uses the boundary operator expansion ( boe ) @xmath152 . </S>",
    "<S> the renormalized theory requires in addition to the bulk re - parameterizations , the multiplicative re - parameterization ( [ eq : bulkrep ] ) , @xmath153^{1/2}\\ ,    \\partial_n\\bphi_{\\rm ren}\\ ] ] and an additive surface counter - term subtracting the primitive divergence ( @xmath154 ) of @xmath155 . the resulting rg equations imply scaling and yield the behaviour @xmath156 , where @xmath124 is the fixed - point value of the exponent function associated with @xmath157 . </S>",
    "<S> a straightforward consequence is that the exponents characterizing the leading infrared singularities of the @xmath74 can be expressed in terms of ( 4 independent ) bulk critical indices and a single surface one , namely , @xmath124 or @xmath119 . upon computing @xmath157 and its exponent function to two - loop order and making extensive use of the results of @xcite and @xcite , we arrived at equations ( [ eq : beta1ord])([eq : eta1infeps ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> let us also note that the scaling dimension of the surface energy density at the ordinary fixed point is given exactly by @xmath158=d+m\\,(\\theta-1)\\;.\\ ] ] that is , the leading thermal singularity of @xmath159 has the bulk - free energy form @xmath160 . </S>",
    "<S> the result can be obtained in a variety of ways , namely : ( i ) by generalizing the analysis given in appendix c of @xcite , ( ii ) by showing that the operator with smallest scaling dimension appearing in the boe of the energy density @xmath161 is the component @xmath162 of the stress - energy tensor [ whose scaling dimension is given by equation ( [ eq : delbendens ] ) ] and ( iii ) by proceeding as in the derivation for the @xmath11 case given in section iii.b of @xcite .    the results ( [ eq : eta1inf ] ) and ( [ eq : eta1infeps ] ) can be combined with known bulk results @xcite to estimate the values of surface critical exponents such as @xmath13 for @xmath39 . in the uniaxial ising case @xmath38 , equation ( [ eq : eta1infeps ] ) becomes @xmath163 which gives @xmath164 if we set @xmath165 ( i.e.  @xmath39 ) , truncating the series at order @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> inserting this value together with the bulk estimates @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 of @xcite into equation ( [ eq : beta1ord ] ) and the analogous expressions @xmath169 and @xmath170 for the surface susceptibility exponents yields @xmath171 owing to the low order @xmath12 of the available series expansions and the large value @xmath165 involved , these estimates can not be trusted to be very precise . </S>",
    "<S> ( they inherit , in particular , any uncertainty of the inserted bulk exponents . ) </S>",
    "<S> however , they compare reasonably well with pleimling s recent monte carlo estimates @xcite @xmath172 , @xmath173 and @xmath174 .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have identified the continuum models that represent the universality classes of the considered ordinary , special and extraordinary ( surface ) transitions at @xmath2-axial bulk lifshitz points , clarified their fixed point structure and presented two - loop rg results . </S>",
