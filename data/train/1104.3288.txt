    "microplasmas operated at atmospheric pressure have recently gained very high attention .",
    "a series of review papers and topical issues of leading scientific journals have discussed their technological promises as well as their scientific challenges @xcite . a particularly popular class of microplasmas",
    "are radio - frequency driven plasma jets , originally proposed by selwyn and co - workers in 1998 @xcite .",
    "many groups have investigated their prospect for surface modification ; the studied processes include etching of tungsten , deposition and etching of silicon oxide , and cleaning of thermolabile surfaces from contaminants @xcite . in order to improve the access for optical diagnostics , schulz - von der gathen and co - workers modified the originally axis - symmetric design of the jet to a plane - parallel geometry @xcite .",
    "their device , termed the micro atmospheric pressure plasma jet ( @xmath0appj ) , is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : jetphoto ] .",
    "it is a geometrically and electrically symmetric capacitively coupled discharge driven via an impedance matching network by rf power of nominally 10 w at the frequency of 13.56 mhz .",
    "the plane - parallel stainless steel electrodes are 30 mm long , 1 mm wide , and separated by a gap of 1  2 mm . to allow direct optical access ,",
    "the sides are made of quartz glass .",
    "the jet is operated with helium as the carrier gas and an admixture of oxygen at a relatively high flow rate of about 1 slm .",
    "the electron density is a few 10@xmath3 @xmath4 , the ion densities are up to 10@xmath5 @xmath4 , and the radical densities can reach several 10@xmath6 @xmath4 .",
    "this work expands earlier one - dimensional simulation approaches by waskoenig et al .",
    "we study the @xmath0appj by means of a two - dimensional numerical simulation .",
    "this allows us to study not only the discharge region but also the effluent of the jet which expands freely into the ambient atmosphere . in the effluent",
    "the gas is characterized by the absence of charged particles and a concentration of reactive radicals .",
    "it was found that the concentration of atomic oxygen decays only slowly outside the plasma volume and that the concentration of ozone even increases for a few centimeter .",
    "these phenomena have been found before by experiments @xcite .",
    "( to show the reliability of the simulation results we present a comparison with experimental findings of ellerweg et al .",
    "the simulations of this study are carried out with the fluid dynamics code _ nonpdpsim _ designed and realized by kushner and co - workers . for a detailed description of the code and its application to various types of plasmas and gas discharges ,",

    "the tabulated data are then consulted in dependence of the fluid dynamically calculated electron temperature @xmath25 .",

    "electrically , the walls are either powered or grounded . with respect to the particle flow , they are either solid , or represent inlets or outlets : the flow is specified to a given flux , while the outlet flow is adjusted to maintain the pressure . finally , it is worth mentioning that the actual implementation of the equations poses some difficulties due to the vast differences in the time scales of the dynamics of the plasma and the neutrals .",
    "these difficulties are overcome by the methods of time - slicing and subcycling .",

    "we believe that the corresponding modeling error is not too severe ; it is still possible to resolve the plasma distribution between the electrodes and the evolution along the direction of the gas flow .",
    "the main error of our `` infinitely wide '' model lies in the boundary conditions of the advective velocity of the fluid at the quartz boundaries .",
    "it translates into the coefficient of the hagen - poiseuille equation being off by about 60% , not too severe a problem as we control the total flux through the jet , not the pressure differential between and outlet . )",

    "the outer boundary of the simulation domain is electrically grounded .",
    "the device is operated as a helium - oxygen @xmath0appj in a pure helium atmosphere at 10@xmath45 pa .",
    "the inlet is fed with a gas mixture with a high flow rate of 1 slm , corresponding to a maximum advective velocity of about 1500 cm / s .",
    "the mixing ratio of helium to oxygen is 1000 to 5 ; experiments indicate that these conditions maximize the concentration of atomic oxygen @xcite .",
    "to maintain the outer environment , pure helium is injected at a flow rate of 1 slm at the left side of the simulation domain . the outlet is controlled to maintain a constant pressure .",
    "the following species are taken into account : ground state neutrals o@xmath46 , o , o@xmath1 , and he , o@xmath47 , representing the first four vibrational levels of o@xmath46 , the electronically excited states o@xmath2 , o@xmath48 , o@xmath49 , o@xmath50 , and he@xmath51 , positive ions o@xmath52 ,",

    "as a result of our simulations , we obtain a complete picture of the dynamics of the @xmath0appj under certain conditions . in this manuscript",
    "we focus on phase - averaged quantities .",
    "the results correspond to a total rf power deposition in the plasma of 0.5 w. ( this value is considerably lower than the nominal rf generator power of about 10 w of the corresponding experiments .",
    "the deviation can be explained by parasitic losses in the matching network and the feed cables .",

    "[ fig : chargedline ] and [ fig : teline ] . between the electrodes we notice the typical structure of a capacitively coupled discharge .",
    "the plasma is separated in two distinct regions , the plasma bulk and the sheath .",
    "the maximum of the electron density is approximately 1.9@xmath61 @xmath4 . in the sheaths it decreases to a much smaller value . a strongly electronegative characteristic can be observed .",
    "the charged particles are dominated by the oxygen species .",
    "the positive ion density is almost exclusively due to o@xmath52 ; o@xmath53 and he@xmath53 are negligible .",
    "the negative ions are o@xmath56 , o@xmath54 and o@xmath55 , in descending order .",
    "the electron temperature @xmath25 in the plasma bulk is approximately 2 ev , in the sheath region it is slightly larger due to increased ohmic heating and possibly due to secondaries .",
    "the effluent of the jet has the character of an afterglow . both the electron density and the electron temperature drop abruptly",
    "this can also be seen from the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : nete ] which show the distribution of the two quantities along the middle axis of the simulation . in the jet channel , @xmath60 and @xmath25",

    "8 shows that this feature holds also for all other charged particles except for o@xmath52 and o@xmath56 .",
    "we conclude from these results that the plasma dynamics in the jet is ( with respect to the @xmath42-coordinate ) `` local '' .",
    "generation of plasma is governed by the local electron temperature profile which in turn is a functional of the local field distribution ; losses are dominated by drift and diffusion to the electrodes : the plasma chemistry is so `` fast '' that transport due to the flow plays a minor role and the solutions become essentially one - dimensional .",
    "the agreement of our results with the results performed by waskoenig et al . by means of a 1d - fluid model is thus not a coincidence @xcite . )",
    "the picture changes drastically when we focus on the reactive neutral species .",
    "( see fig . [",
    "fig : reactivespecies ] . ) for the neutrals the chemistry is `` slow '' , and it takes a considerable time ( or distance along the flow ) for the species to build up .",
    "particularly o , o@xmath1 and o@xmath2 increase in the jet channel . in the effluent ,",
    "their destruction is also slow ; they are transported over a distance of a few cm .",
    "the density of ozone even increases slightly and remains constant for a certain length .",
    "the reason for this behavior is that the activated species are not directly generated by the plasma electrons but by heavy particle chemistry .",
    "a particular case are the ions o@xmath52 and o@xmath56 .",
    "the generation of o@xmath52 is via electron impact ionization and therefore fast , the generation of o@xmath56 is slow because it involves ion chemistry .",
    "the destruction is slow for both species , they are transported about 1 cm into the effluent : o@xmath52 and o@xmath56 form the end points of the positive and negative ion chemistry , respectively , and their direct recombination constant is relatively small .    further down in the effluent , therefore , only three species play a role : o , o@xmath1 and o@xmath2 .",
    "their spatial distribution is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : spatialo ] , [ fig : spatialo3 ] , and [ fig : spatialometa ] .",
    "atomic oxygen reacts with molecular oxygen to ozone ; its density thus decays exponentially .",
    "the rate constant , however , is relatively small ; 2 cm behind the nozzle of the jet it still has a concentration of 3@xmath62 @xmath4 .",
    "the densities of ozone ( 2@xmath63 @xmath4 ) and excited oxygen ( 1@xmath63 @xmath4 ) remain nearly constant up to the outlet .",

    "( note that we changed the simulation parameters slightly to accommodate the experiment : the jet gap size was decreased to 1 mm .",

    "in this work we employed the code _ nonpdpsim _ to conduct a numerical simulation of an rf - driven atmospheric pressure plasma jet operated with a mixture of helium and oxygen . in several aspects",
    "our study goes beyond previous work .",
    "the two - dimensional spatial resolution of the simulation allows to investigate not only the profile of the discharge parameters between the electrodes but also their transport through the jet and into the environment .",
    "we found a pronounced difference in the behavior of the charged particles and the neutrals .",
    "the charges  @xmath64 and predominantly o@xmath52 , o@xmath55 , o@xmath54  are governed by a `` fast '' chemistry : in the jet , their production is local in @xmath42 and their losses are dominated by drift and diffusion to the electrodes  this can be understood in a 1d - picture which resolves only the @xmath43-axis @xcite . in the effluent , they are virtually absent .",
    "the neutrals , in contrast , obey a `` slow '' chemistry .",
    "the reactive oxygen species o , o@xmath1 and o@xmath2 build up along the @xmath42-axis of the jet and are then flow - transported far into the effluent ; their distribution is genuinely `` two - dimensional '' .",
    "( actually , it will be `` three - dimensional '' .",
    "we believe , however , that the restriction of our analysis to two dimensions does not introduce more than quantitative errors . )    in summary , our simulation results indicate that the influence of the jet on the environment is primarily of chemical nature . even in the jet ,",
    "the density of the activated oxygen species is four orders of magnitude higher than the maximum density of the charges , and in the effluent the charges vanish completely .",
    "this view is in agreement with the experimental findings established by various other researchers @xcite . in particular ozone with a longer lifetime than atomic oxygen and the very reactive o@xmath2",
    "are able to react with surfaces over a long distance @xcite .",
    "excited atomic oxygen species , in contrast , plays a relatively minor role due to its lower concentration",
    ".    further work on the @xmath0appj will focus on the transient behavior of the device and also on its interaction with a more complex environment .",
