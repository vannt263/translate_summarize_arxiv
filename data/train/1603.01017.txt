    "a large fraction of main sequence stars are found in binary systems @xcite .",
    "it is expected that @xmath225 per cent of all main sequence binaries are close enough to begin mass transfer interactions when the more massive star becomes a red giant or an asymptotic giant star @xcite .",
    "this has been observationally verified e.g. by @xcite and by @xcite . because the mass transfer rate generally exceeds the eddington limit",
    ", the secondary star is not able to accrete the transferred material and the system evolves through a common envelope phase .",
    "that is , the core of the giant and the main sequence companion orbit within a common envelope formed by the outer layers of the giant star .",
    "drag forces between the two stars and the envelope lead to the shrinkage of the orbit and therefore to the release of orbital energy .",
    "the orbital energy is deposited into the envelope and is eventually used to eject it @xcite .",
    "the outcome of common envelope evolution is hence a close binary formed by the core of the giant star ( which later becomes a white dwarf ) and a main sequence companion , i.e. a close white dwarf - main sequence ( wdms ) binary .",
    "these are commonly referred to as post - common envelope binaries ( pcebs ) .",
    "the remaining @xmath275 per cent of main sequence binaries are wide enough to avoid mass transfer interactions . in these cases",
    "the more massive stars evolve like single stars until they eventually become white dwarfs .",
    "the orbital separations of such wdms binaries are similar to those of the main sequence binaries from which they descend .    during the last years",
    "we have mined the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) spectroscopic data base to build up the largest , most homogeneous and complete catalogue of wdms binaries @xcite , which contains 2316 systems as for data release ( dr ) 8 .",
    "observational studies led by our team have resulted in the identification of 1050 wide sdss wdms binaries and 206 pcebs @xcite , for which we have measured the orbital period of 90 @xcite .    the analysis of the entire sdss wdms binary sample , as well as the sub - samples of close pcebs and widely separated wdms binaries have led to numerous advances in several fields of modern astrophysics .",
    "these include for example : constraining current theories of close compact binary evolution @xcite ; demonstrating in a robust way that the majority of low - mass white dwarfs are formed in binaries @xcite ; constraining the pairing properties of main sequence stars @xcite ; providing robust observational evidence for disrupted magnetic braking @xcite ; constraining the rotation - age - activity relation of low - mass main sequence stars @xcite ; studying the statistical properties of the pceb population using monte carlo techniques @xcite ; analysing why the average mass of white dwarfs in cataclysmic variables is significantly larger than the average mass of single white dwarfs @xcite ; testing hierarchical probabilistic models used to infer properties of unseen companions to low - mass white dwarfs @xcite ; detecting new gravitational wave verification sources @xcite ; analysing the interior structural effects of common envelope evolution on low - mass pulsating white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "in addition , many eclipsing sdss pcebs have been identified @xcite which are being used to test theoretical mass - radius relations of both white dwarfs and low - mass main sequence stars @xcite , as well as the existence of circumbinary planets @xcite .",
    "the motivation of this paper is to update our spectroscopic catalogue of sdss wdms binaries by searching for new identifications within the third survey generation of the sdss ( sdssiii , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to thus increase the number of systems available for follow - up studies .",
    "in this work we search for wdms binaries within the spectroscopic data base of the sdssiii , i.e. the ninth @xcite , tenth @xcite , eleventh and twelfth @xcite drs of the sdss",
    ". in particular , we mined the optical ( @xmath32000 ) spectra obtained by the sloan exploration of galactic understanding and evolution 2 survey ( segue-2 ; c. rockosi et al . 2015 , in preparation ) and the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ; * ? ? ?",
    "boss uses a new set of spectrographs with 1000 fibres available per exposure .",
    "the main goal of the survey is to obtain spectra for galaxies and quasars selected from the sdss imaging data to study the baryon oscillation feature in the clustering of galaxies and lyman-@xmath1 absorption along the line of sight to distant quasars .",
    "boss uses a different target selection criteria for targeting quasars @xcite than the one employed by the sdssi / ii surveys .",
    "thus , whilst sdssi / ii targeted objects with @xmath4 19.1 , boss went down to @xmath5 22.0 in order to give a significantly higher surface density of targets than in sdssi / ii @xcite .",
    "boss has obtained a total number of 4,571,520 spectra .",
    "because wdms binaries and quasars overlap in colour space @xcite , we expect a large number of wdms binaries being ( most likely accidentally ) observed by the boss survey .",
    "segue-2 used the sdssi / ii spectrographs to obtain spectra of stars at high and low galactic latitudes to study galactic structure , dynamics , and stellar populations .",
    "segue-2 gathered a total of 155,520 spectra .",
    "-sn ( left ) and wt ( right ) methods .",
    "bottom panel : the same but considering only spectra of sn@xmath65 . ]    in @xcite we developed a routine based on reduced @xmath7 and signal - to - noise ( sn ) ratio constraints ( @xmath7-sn method hereafter ) to identify spectroscopic sdss wdms binaries . as in our previous works",
    ", we use this method here for identifying wdms binaries observed by the sdssiii survey .    in a first step",
    "we @xmath7-fit all sdssiii spectra with a grid of 163 wdms binary templates covering a wide range of white dwarf effective temperatures ( 6000100000k ) and surface gravities ( 6.59.5 dex ) , and secondary star m - dwarf spectral types ( m0m9 ) and represent the reduced @xmath7 values as a function of sn ratio for each template .",
    "we then define an equation of the form @xmath8 and consider as wdms binary candidates all objects below this curve ( @xmath9 ) , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are free parameters defined for each template and @xmath12 is the @xmath7 that results from fitting a considered spectrum with a given template ( see @xcite for a complete description of the method ) .",
    "the form of eq.(1 ) is defined to account for systematic errors between template and observed spectra , which become more important the larger the sn ratio is .",
    "this exercise resulted in 9,593 wdms binary candidate spectra which were visually inspected .",
    "we also inspected their sdss images for morphological problems and made use of the galex ultraviolet @xcite and ukidss infrared @xcite magnitudes to probe for the presence of excess flux at the blue and red ends of the sdss spectra , respectively .",
    "we found 872 of the 9,593 selected spectra to be genuine wdms binaries and we considered 47 spectra as wdms binary candidates . in",
    "what follows , we flag an object to be a wdms binary candidate when the spectrum is that of a white dwarf ( main sequence star ) displaying some red ( blue ) flux excess which can not be confirmed to arise from a companion due to the lack of galex ( ukidss ) magnitudes .    the above outlined @xmath7-sn method has been proven to be very efficient at identifying wdms binaries , achieving a completeness ( defined as the ratio between the number of sdss wdms binary spectra we have successfully identified and the total number of sdss wdms binary spectra observed ) around 96 per cent @xcite .",
    "however , it is important to keep in mind that the limiting magnitude of the quasar survey has been modified from @xmath1319.1 in sdssi / ii to @xmath1422 in sdssiii .",
    "we therefore expect a considerable fraction of sdssiii wdms binary spectra to generally be of lower sn ratio than those from sdssi / ii .",
    "low sn ratio spectra ( @xmath15 ) are challenging to classify for any method , including our @xmath7-sn routine .",

    "the spectroscopic catalogue of sdss wdms binaries now contains 3294 systems from dr12 .",
    "979 are additions from the here presented work , 646 of which have not been published before .",
    "this is by far the largest , most complete and most homogeneous catalogue of compact binaries currently available .",
    "we have provided stellar parameters ( white dwarf effective temperatures , surface gravities and masses , and secondary star spectral types ) and rvs for the here identified wdms binaries .",
    "we have also applied 3d corrections to the derived white dwarf parameters of all sdss wdms binaries .",
    "the stellar parameter distributions corresponding to wdms binaries observed by the different surveys of sdss ( legacy , boss , segue , segue-2 ) are statistically different due to the different target selection criteria used .",
    "this clearly reveals that the sdss wdms binary sample , though being the largest , is heavily affected by selection effects .",
    "in particular , we find indications for these selection effects to be responsible for the overall scarcity of observed sdss wdms binaries containing late type ( @xmath16m6 ) companions .",
    "the rvs of 98 of our here studied sdss wdms binaries ( 62 of which are new identifications ) display significant variation and we flag these systems as close binaries . for three of them",
    "the rv data are sufficient to estimate their orbital periods .",
    "we have also identified seven wdms binaries as eclipsing , although all of them have been published before .",
