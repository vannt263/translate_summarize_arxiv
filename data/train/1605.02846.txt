    "along with the development of observational cosmology , including the recent gravity - wave detection , the theoretical study of compact objects is actively advancing apace . thus far",

    "the study of self - gravitating systems is very interesting because the characteristics of general relativity or the modified gravity appear in the physical quantities of the system .",
    "for example , brihaye , hartmann , and collaborators argued about a boson star solution in a higher - dimensional spacetime @xcite .",
    "from the perspective of particle cosmology , the boson star @xcite is one of the candidates for dark matter @xcite .",
    "the ( @xmath0)-dimensional boson star was studied as the simplest model of a self - gravitating system and the newtonian treatment of gravitating bosons has been often discussed @xcite .",
    "although the difference between the newtonian treatment and the general relativistic model is significant , the newtonian treatment is known to enable the evaluation of the mass of the boson star qualitatively .",
    "it is necessary to examine the newtonian approximation in higher - dimensional boson systems , since a substantial understanding is important to check whether a universal property of compact objects exists even in the modified gravity theory .",
    "we discuss the qualitative behavior of models such as a four - dimensional rotating boson star ( which has been studied in the general relativistic model @xcite ) , a boson star in dimensions with compactified space and five - dimensional boson stars using newtonian approximation .",
    "we study the system of a scalar field with large self - interaction @xcite in this paper .",
    "a deep understanding of the basic aspects of self - gravitating systems , which is independent of a possible correction in the gravity theory , is expected from this study .",

    "although they attributed this instability to the power of the long - range tail of the gravitational potential , it is obvious that the stability depends on the balance between the self - interaction of the scalar field and the gravity .",
    "therefore , the newtonian approach in the higher dimensions will be a useful as well as significant method to study boson stars in models with general scalar potentials .",
    "in this paper , newtonian boson stars in the large coupling limit have been studied by means of various approximation methods . in summary , we found the qualitative behavior of the boson star parameters : 1 ) the newtonian binding energy is determined by the particle number and the value of the gravitational potential , in addition to the energy from the rotation .",

    "we used mathematica 4.2 @xcite on a personal computer for numerical calculations .",
    "of course , elaborate calculation on a large system would yield better results in terms of quality as well as quantity . in the present paper , since we used the minimal number of parameters to describe the deformation of the rotating boson star , we limit ourselves to a qualitative conclusion .",
    "the most important subject to be examined is the introduction of more parameters which determine the shape of the boson star in detail .",
    "this also depends on the computational environment .",
    "the boson stars with finite self - coupling can also be approximated analytically by connecting the exponential tail in the asymptotic region of the boson star @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to study the stability of the boson star in higher dimensions with analytical approximations in the newtonian limit .",
    "we wish to solve the configuration of the binary of the boson stars in a similar methods shown in this paper .",
    "the newtonian treatment of the system would shed light on a possible relation among the physical quantities of the binary boson stars and provide an initial state for the dynamical calculation with general relativity or other theories of gravity .",

    "the study of such systems with the newtonian approximation is interesting and may reveal an essential nature of gravity .",
    "finally , we anticipate that the newtonian approach to the boson star would be valid for a multi - scalar system with many @xmath210 charges , such as the ` multi - state boson star ' @xcite , and the boson - fermion system @xcite , in order to extract its inherent characteristics in an efficient manner .",
