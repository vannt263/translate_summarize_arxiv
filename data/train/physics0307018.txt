    "the density of states ( dos ) is a fundamental quantity from which many macroscopic quantities can be derived . indeed , once the dos is known , the partition function can be computed yielding the free energy of the system .",
    "it follows that the heat capacity , forces , etc can be derived .",
    "a well - known example of a macroscopic quantity that follows immediately from the knowledge of the electromagnetic dos is the casimir force@xcite .",
    "other examples are shear forces @xcite and heat transfer @xcite between two semi - infinite dielectrics .",
    "recently , it has been shown that unexpected coherence properties of thermal emission at short distances from an interface separating vacuum from a polar material are due to the contribution to the density of states of resonant surface waves @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that the casimir force can be interpreted as essentially due to the surface waves contribution to the dos @xcite .",
    "calculating and measuring the local density of states ( ldos ) in the vicinity of an interface separating a real material from a vacuum is therefore necessary to understand many problems currently studied .",
    "the density of states is usually derived from the green function of the system by taking the imaginary part of the green s function@xcite . in solid - state physics",
    ", the electronic local density of states at the fermi energy at the surface of a metal can be measured with a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm )  @xcite .",
    "this has been proved by several experiments , in particular the so - called quantum corral experiments  @xcite .",
    "although one can formally generalize the definition of the electromagnetic ldos by using the trace of the imaginary part of the green s tensor@xcite , it turns out that this definition does not yield the correct equilibrium electromagnetic energy density .",
    "recently , it has been shown theoretically that the stm and the scanning near - field optical microscope ( snom ) have strong analogies  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , in the weak tip - sample coupling limit , it was demonstrated that a unified formalism can be used to relate the stm signal to the electronic ldos and the snom signal to electromagnetic ldos .",
    "snom instruments  @xcite have been used to perform different kinds of emission spectroscopy , such as luminescence  @xcite , raman spectroscopy  @xcite or two - photon fluorescence  @xcite . for detection of infrared light , apertureless techniques  @xcite",
    "have shown their reliability for imaging  @xcite as well as for vibrational spectroscopy on molecules  @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent calculations and experiments have shown that an optical analog of the quantum corral could be designed , and that the measured snom images on such a structure present strong similarities with the calculated electromagnetic ldos  @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that the electromagnetic ldos could be directly measured with a snom .",
    "the purpose of this article is to show how the electromagnetic ldos can be related to the electric green - function , and to discuss possible measurements of the ldos in snom .",
    "we first introduce a general definition of the electromagnetic ldos in a vacuum in presence of materials , possibly lossy objects .",
    "then , we show that under some well - defined circumstances , the ldos is proportional to the imaginary part of the trace of the electrical green function .",
    "the results are illustrated by calculating the ldos above a metal surface .",
    "we show next that the signal detected with a snom measuring the thermally emitted field near a heated body is closely related to the ldos and conclude that the natural experiment to detect the ldos is to perform a near - field thermal emission spectrum .",
    "we discuss the influence of the tip shape .",
    "we also discuss whether standard snom measurements using an external illumination can detect the electromagnetic ldos  @xcite .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , the ldos is often defined as being the imaginary part of the trace of the electric - field green dyadic .",
    "this approach seems to give a correct description in some cases  @xcite , but to our knowledge this definition has never been derived properly for electromagnetic fields in a general system that includes an arbitrary distribution of matter with possible losses .",
    "the aim of this section is to propose an unambiguous definition of the ldos .",
    "let us consider a system at equilibrium temperature @xmath0 .",
    "using statistical physics , we write the electromagnetic energy @xmath1 at a given _ positive _ frequency @xmath2 , as the product of the dos by the mean energy of a state at temperature @xmath0 , so that @xmath3 where @xmath4 is planck s constant and @xmath5 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "we can now introduce@xcite a _ local _ density of states by starting with the local density of electromagnetic energy energy @xmath6 at a given point @xmath7 in space , and at a given frequency @xmath2 .",
    "this can be written by definition of the ldos @xmath8 as    @xmath9    the density of electromagnetic energy is the sum of the electric energy and of the magnetic energy . at equilibrium",
    ", it can be calculated using the system green s function and the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "let us introduce the electric and magnetic field correlation functions for a stationnary system @xmath10 note that here , the integration over @xmath2 goes from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath13 is the electric current density in the system , the electric field reads @xmath14 . in the same way , the magnetic field",
    "is related to the density of magnetic currents @xmath15 by @xmath16 . in these two expressions , @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    "are the dyadic green functions of the electric and magnetic field , respectively .",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation theorem yields  @xcite that @xmath19}\\frac{\\mu_0\\omega}{2\\pi}im g^{e}_{ij}({{\\bf r}},{{\\bf r}}',\\omega ) \\\\",

    "in fact , one has @xmath22.{{\\stackrel{\\leftrightarrow}{\\bf g}}}^e({{\\bf r}},{{\\bf r}}',{\\omega}).\\left[\\nabla_{{{\\bf r}}'}\\times\\right]\\ ] ] a comparison of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : defldos ] ) and ( [ eq : imtr ] ) shows that the ldos of the electromagetic field reads @xmath23 = f({{\\stackrel{\\leftrightarrow}{\\bf g}}}^e )      \\label{eq : ldosimtr}\\ ] ] in which @xmath24 is an operator which will be discussed more precisely in the next section .",
    "the goal of this section is to study the ldos behavior for some well - characterised physical situations , based on the result in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ldosimtr ] ) .      in a vacuum , the imaginary part of the trace of the electric and magnetic field green functions are equal .",
    "indeed , the electric and magnetic field green functions obeys the same equations and have the same boundary conditions in this case ( radiation condition at infinity ) . in a vacuum , the ldos",
    "is thus obtained by considering the electric field contribution only , and multiplying the result by a factor of two .",
    "one recovers the familiar result @xmath25 which shows in particular that the ldos is homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "let us consider a plane interface separating a vacuum ( medium 1 , corresponding to the upper half - space ) from a semi - infinite material ( medium 2 , corresponding to the lower half - space ) characterised by its complex dielectric constant @xmath26 ( the material is assumed to be linear , isotropic and non - magnetic ) .",
    "inserting the expressions of the electric and magnetic - field green functions for this geometry @xcite into equation ( [ eq : ldosimtr ] ) , one finds the expression of the ldos at a given frequency and at a given height @xmath27 above the interface in vacuum .",
    "in this situation , the magnetic and electric green functions are not the same .",
    "this is due to the boundary counditions at the interface which are different for the electric and magnetic fields . in order to discuss the origin of the different contributions to the ldos",
    ", we define and calculate an electric ldos ( @xmath28 ) due to the electric - field green function only , and a magnetic ldos ( @xmath29 ) due to the magnetic - field green function only .",
    "the total ldos @xmath30 has a clear physical meaning unlike @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "note that @xmath28 is the quantity which is usually calculated and considered to be the true ldos . in the geometry considered here , the expression of the electric ldos is  @xcite @xmath31\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\left.\\int_{1}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\kappa d\\kappa}{|p| } \\left[im(r_{12}^s)+\\left(2\\kappa^2 - 1\\right)im(r_{12}^p)\\right]e^{-2|p|{\\omega}z / c}\\right\\ } \\label{ldoselec}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expression is actually a summation over all possible plane waves with wave number @xmath32 where @xmath33 if @xmath34 and @xmath35 if @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 are the fresnel reflection factors between media 1 and 2 in @xmath39 and @xmath40 polarisations , respectively , for a parallel wave vector @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "@xmath42 corresponds to propagating waves whereas @xmath36 corresponds to evanescent waves .",
    "a similar expression for the magnetic ldos can be obtained  : @xmath43\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\left.\\int_{1}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\kappa d\\kappa}{|p| } \\left[im(r_{12}^p)+\\left(2\\kappa^2 - 1\\right)im(r_{12}^s)\\right]e^{-2|p|{\\omega}z / c}\\right\\ } \\label{ldosmagn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] adding the electric and magnetic contributions yields the total ldos  : @xmath44\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\left.\\int_{1}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\kappa^3 d\\kappa}{|p| } \\left[im(r_{12}^s)+im(r_{12}^p)\\right]e^{-2|p|{\\omega}z / c}\\right\\ } \\label{ldos}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is important to note that the electric and magnetic ldos have similar expressions , but are in general not equal .",
    "the expression of @xmath45 is obtained by exchanging the @xmath39 and @xmath40 polarisations in the expression of @xmath46 . as a result",
    ", the two polarisations have a symmetric role in the expression of the total ldos @xmath47 .",
    "the vacuum situation can be recovered from the previous expression by setting the values of the fresnel reflection factors to zero .",
    "the same result is also obtained by taking the ldos at large distance from the interface , i.e , for @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the wavelength .",
    "this means that at large distances , the interface does not perturb the density of electromagnetic states .",
    "in fact , @xmath50 becomes negligible for the evanescent waves and @xmath51 is a rapidly oscillating function for the propagating waves when integrating over @xmath52 .",
    "the result is that all the terms containing exponential do not contribute to the integral giving the ldos in the vacuum .",
    "conversely , at short distance from the interface , @xmath53 is drastically modified compared to its free - space value . equations ( [ ldoselec])-([ldos ] ) show that the fresnel coefficients and therefore the nature of the material play a crucial role in this modification .",
    "for example , as pointed out by agarwal @xcite , in the case of a perfectly conducting surface , the contribution of the electric and magnetic ldos vanish , except for their free - space contribution . in this particular case",
    ", one also retrieves the vacuum result .",
    "we now focus our attention to real materials like metals and dielectrics .",
    "we first calculate @xmath54 for aluminum at different heights .",
    "aluminum is a metal whose dielectric constant is well described by a drude model for near - uv , visible and near - ir frequencies @xcite : @xmath55 with @xmath56 10@xmath57 rad.s@xmath58 and @xmath59 10@xmath60 rad.s@xmath58 .",
    "we plotted in fig.[ldosz ] the ldos @xmath53 in the near uv - near ir frequency domain at four different heights .",
    "we first note that the ldos increases drastically when the distance to the material is reduced .",
    "as discussed in the previous paragraph , at large distance from the material , one retrieves the vacuum density of states .",
    "note that at a given distance , it is always possible to find a sufficiently high frequency for which the corresponding wavelength is small compared to the distance so that a far - field situation is retrieved .",
    "when the distance to the material is reduced , additional modes are present : these are the evanescent modes that are confined close to the interface and that can not be seen in the far field .",
    "moreover , aluminum exhibits a resonance around @xmath61 . below this frequency ,",
    "the material supports resonant surface waves ( surface - plasmon polaritons ) .",
    "additional modes are therefore seen in the near field .",
    "this produces an increase of the ldos close to the interface .",
    "the enhancement is particularly important at the resonant frequency which corresponds to @xmath62=-1 $ ] .",
    "this behavior is analogous to that previously described in ref.@xcite for a sic surface supporting surface - phonon polaritons .",
    "also note that in the low frequency regime , the ldos increases .",
    "finally , fig.[ldosz ] shows that it is possible to have a ldos smaller than that of vacuum at some particular distances and frequencies .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the propagating and evanescent waves contributions to the ldos above an aluminum sample at a distance of 10 nm .",
    "the propagating contribution is very similar to that of the vacuum ldos .",
    "as expected , the evanescent contribution dominates at low - frequency and around the surface - plasmon polariton resonance ) , where pure near - field contributions dominates .",
    "we now turn to the comparison of @xmath63 with the usual definition often encountered in the literature , which corresponds to @xmath64 .",
    "we plot in fig.[fig3 ] @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 above an aluminum surface at a distance @xmath68 . in this figure , it is possible to identify three different domains for the ldos behaviour .",
    "we note again that in the far - field situation ( corresponding here to high frequencies i.e. @xmath69 ) , the ldos reduces to the vacuum situation . in this case @xmath70 . around the resonance ,",
    "the ldos is dominated by the electric - field green contribution .",
    "conversely , at low frequencies , @xmath29 dominates .",
    "thus , fig.[fig3 ] shows that we have to be very careful when using the expression @xmath71 . above aluminum and at a distance @xmath72 , this approximation is only valid on a small range between @xmath73 and @xmath74 .        in order to get more physical insight ,",
    "we have calculated the asymptotic ldos behaviour in the three regimes mentioned above .",
    "as we have already seen , the far - field regime ( @xmath77 ) corresponds to the vacuum case . to study the near - field situation , we focus on the evanescent contribution as suggested by the results in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "when @xmath78 , the exponential term @xmath79 is small only for @xmath80 . in this ( quasi - static ) limit , the fresnel reflection factors reduce to @xmath81 asymptotically , the expressions of @xmath64 and @xmath82 are latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath154 . comparing this expression and ( [ erecfourier]),then @xmath155 where @xmath156 .",
    "furthermore , using the fact that @xmath157 and defining @xmath158 @xmath159 let us denote @xmath160 the field radiated by the reciprocal current in @xmath161 .",
