    "this corresponds to a crossing of the g - band with the @xmath47-band of two strongly aligned @xmath48 quasiparticles .",

    "in fact , a sharp level crossing of the ground state band @xmath49 and a two - quasiparticle band @xmath50 with very different angular momenta can not be described properly at constant angular velocity @xmath7 using a single slater determinant @xmath6 . in reality",

    "unfortunately this method is numerically rather involved .",
    "there are , however , many successful applications based on simple separable models@xcite .    summarizing this section",
    "we can say that the backbending phenomenon in rotational bands of deformed nuclei presents a rather complicated interplay of collective and single particle degrees of freedom .",
    "the coriolis force tries to align the single particle angular momenta in the direction of the rotational axis .",
    "it counteracts the pairing forces favoring pairs with opposite angular momenta .",
    "the resulting coriolis anti pairing effect , however , does not cause a collective alignment with pairing collapse , as one finds it in simple degenerate models@xcite .",
    "high-@xmath39 intruder orbits feel a stronger coriolis force and align first and one observes a band crossing between the ground state and the lowest aligned band .",
    "if the residual interaction between these two bands is small one has a sudden transition and backbending , otherwise a smooth alignment with a slowly increasing moment of inertia .",
    "because of self - consistency the collective properties of the nucleus are also involved in this transition@xcite . in the aligned band one of the pairs",
    "does not participate in pairing and therefore , because of the blocking effect , pairing is reduced by roughly 20 % .",
    "the alignment also causes small triaxial @xmath36-deformations .",
    "it requires , however , rather high spin to align more and more pairs in order to generate substantial triaxiality and only for the terminating bands@xcite , where all the particles in the valence shell are aligned , does one find transitions to oblate shapes .      over the years , many rotational bands have been found , but as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] not all of them show backbending . from the previous considerations it is clear that backbending occurs only , if the interaction between the two crossing bands is weak enough . for strong interactions",
    "one observes a smooth increase of the moment of inertia .",
    "of course , the phenomenon would be most pronounced for vanishing interaction , i.e. for a sharp crossing of the two levels with the same signature as in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . according to the _ no - crossing rule _ of von neumann and wigner@xcite two eigenvalues with the same symmetry should never cross .",
    "this is , however , not a theorem but only a rule .",
    "there are exceptional points , in particular for hamiltonians depending on two parameters as shown schematically in fig .",
    "each eigenvalue @xmath54 forms a surface and there are _ diabolic points _ ,",
    "where two of these surfaces touch .",
    "in the neighborhood of such a point , the two touching surfaces have the structure of a double cone , which reminded berry@xcite of an italian toy called a `` diabolo '' .      long before berry had introduced this nomenclature , bengtsson , hamamoto and mottelson@xcite had , in 1978 , found that there are such exceptional points in the spectrum of the rotating hfb hamiltonian ( [ hfb - rot ] ) which depended on two parameters @xmath9 and @xmath7 . as shown by nikam and ring@xcite they are distributed in the ( @xmath55)-plan according to a very characteristic pattern , which is determined by the single particle angular momentum @xmath39 of the intruder shell . in the rare earths",
    "this is the @xmath56-orbit .",
    "the corresponding pattern is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . in the nuclear potential of prolate shape",
    "this intruder orbit with positive parity is split and the two - fold degenerate sub - levels having the magnetic quantum numbers @xmath57 are distributed between the remaining neutron levels of different parity . with increasing neutron number , i.e. with growing chemical potential @xmath9 , these levels are filled pairwise according to their energy in the order @xmath58 .",
    "we observe sharp backbending close to the diabolic points , where the interaction between the levels is small , and a smooth increase of the moment of inertia in the area far from these points .",
    "this leads to the _ oscillating behavior of backbending@xcite_.    beside the row of 5 diabolic points having small @xmath7-values we have further diabolic points so that we can expect further backbending phenomena at higher spin values . in order to understand the pattern , at least in a qualitative way",

    "they are 1 , but with increasing angular velocity they are reduced , and , in many cases , they oscillate .",
    "such a behavior can best be understood within a one - dimensional oscillator model , in which @xmath73 is replaced by the pushing operator @xmath74 . in this case",
    "the single particle wave functions can be obtained analytically as oscillator functions shifted in momentum space by @xmath75 . for the ground state",
    "these functions are gaussians and the overlap decreases monotonically .",
    "for the first exited state we have one node in the wave function and therefore also one node in the overlap , for the second excited state there are two nodes , and this goes on accordingly for higher excited states .",

    "they are connected with vanishing matrix elements between states with positive and negative signature . for small @xmath27 , only the diagonal matrix elements @xmath76 are important .",
    "the specific pattern occurs , because they are proportional to the spatial overlap matrix elements @xmath68 . for increasing @xmath27 the pair transfer is enhanced and off - diagonal elements can not be neglected , however , the pattern of zero s does not change .",

    "there are certainly many ways to establish definite phase relations on this bundle @xmath80 but the most natural way is through parallel transport @xmath81 the vanishing of linear terms leads to the differential equation for @xmath82 @xmath83 starting with the function @xmath84 on the closed path @xmath78 we find on returning to the same point the wave function @xmath85 which differs from the starting function @xmath86 by the berry phase @xmath87 .",
    "it is a characteristic non - integrable phase , a purely geometrical property of the line bundle @xmath88 which is understood in mathematical physics@xcite as an anholonomy and which has been observed in many areas of physics@xcite .",
    "it can be shown that this phase is -1 for a real hamiltonian in a two - dimensional case with two touching surfaces .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we apply this concept of a berry phase to the spectrum of the rotating hfb equation ( [ hfb - rot ] ) . for each set of parameters ( @xmath55 )",
    "we have a set of generalized slater determinants @xmath89 .",
    "they are characterized by a specific occupation pattern of the quasiparticle levels of fig .",

    "since the lowest quasiparticle energy becomes negative for @xmath95 both bands are nearly degenerate in the region of the diabolic point .",
    "we have to keep in mind the physical meaning of a closed a path in this surface : changes in @xmath9 at constant @xmath7 correspond to changes in the particle number @xmath69 , i.e. to a particle transfer ( @xmath96 ) for constant angular momentum @xmath3 and changes in @xmath7 at constant @xmath9 correspond to changes in the angular momentum @xmath3 for constant particle number , i.e. to transitions with @xmath97 within the rotational band . in reality",
    "we have only integer values for @xmath69 and @xmath3 and our path is discrete , but as long as we stay within the classical limit of continuous changes in @xmath9 and @xmath7 we encounter no problem in defining phase relations through parallel transport ( [ parallel - transport ] ) . following a closed path around the diabolic point we find a berry phase -1 for the intrinsic wave functions .",
    "so far we have considered only the topological structure of the intrinsic cranking hamiltonian ( [ hfb - rot ] ) whose eigenfunctions @xmath98 are generalized slater determinants . as discussed in section  [ sec3 ] , the cranking model fails to describe the details of a sharp level crossing properly .",
    "it is therefore by no means clear , that the topological considerations of the last section also apply to wave functions in the laboratory frame having good particle number and angular momentum .    in order to clarify the question of berry phases in the laboratory frame , we consider , in the following , the wave functions given in eq .",
    "( [ psm ] ) making use of the projected shell model introduced by hara and sun@xcite . as in the experiment",
    ", we have in this case no continuous parameters @xmath9 and @xmath7 , but only discrete integer values of the quantum numbers @xmath69 and @xmath3 which form a lattice ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "a closed path around a possible diabolic point on this lattice corresponds to a quantized path @xmath99 having good particle number and angular momentum the wave functions of this lattice are orthogonal and the concept of parallel transport ( [ parallel - transport ] ) fails .",
    "a new concept has been introduced@xcite to establish phase relationships and to connect the wave functions along this path by considering the matrix elements @xmath100 of a suitable _ connection operator _ @xmath101 .",
    "a reasonable choice for this operator is @xmath102 , i.e. the quadrupole operator @xmath103 for states within a rotational band and the pair transfer operators @xmath104 and @xmath105 for states with constant angular momentum .",
    "this is a natural definition for the connection operator on the yrast surface of superfluid nuclei .",
    "starting from the ground state of one nucleus , each point on this surface can be reached either by the excitation of collective rotations in gauge space ( pairing rotations@xcite ) or in @xmath106-space ( normal rotations ) and experimentally these excitations occur primarily through pair transfer or quadrupole excitations .",
    "we then have to choose the three relative phases along our discretized path ( [ path ] ) in such a fashion that all three matrix elements @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 are positive .",
    "the phase of the last matrix element @xmath110 on this closed path is then no longer open .",
    "it has to be calculated , and we have to distinguish two cases : ( i ) if it is positive , which is the normal case , we obviously have no berry phase and no diabolic point within the path , ( ii ) if it is negative , we have a berry phase -1 .",
    "we call such a case a diabolic plaque .",
    "this is the definition of a diabolic point in the discrete case of a lattice .",
    "it obviously makes no sense to define a specific point inside the plaque .",
    "obviously this definition of a diabolic point for the many - body wave functions with discrete quantum numbers is in complete agreement with the considerations of the last section where we found in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] a sign change for the pair transfer matrix elements at the diabolic point .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we show realistic applications@xcite of the projected shell model for pair transfer matrix elements in the hf - chain . the diabolic points in @xmath111hf and @xmath112hf are clearly seen .",
    "these calculations are in very good agreement with mean field results in the cranking model .",
    "it shows that the berry phase and the reduction of the pair transfer matrix elements at the diabolic point is reproduced at the mean field level rather well .    of course the phase relations defined along the discrete path ( [ path ] ) by the connection operator @xmath101",
    "can also be determined by requiring that the two transfer matrix elements @xmath108 and @xmath113 are positive . in this case",
    "we find a sign change and zero s in the quadrupole matrix elements indicating a complete mixture of the wave functions in the area of a diabolic point .",
    "the fact that the pair transfer matrix element changes sign in the region of the diabolic point has been called _",
    "diabolic pair transfer_@xcite . in theoretical investigations@xcite of coulomb excitations ,",
    "connected with pair transfer , one finds a strong reduction of the transfer cross section in this region .",
    "of course the real proof of the existence of this change in phase would require the observation of an increase of this cross section after the diabolic region .",
    "on the other hand , in this region , there is considerable mixing and the probability for excitations within the band is also reduced@xcite .",
    "this might be the reason that , in experiment , diabolic pair transfer has , so far , not been observed  @xcite .",
    "strong @xmath114- and @xmath115-interactions in nuclei with open proton and neutron shells lead to considerable correlations between the valence particles .",
    "one observes phase transitions to deformed shapes and to superfluid condensates of @xmath105-pairs with angular momenta pointing in opposite directions .",
    "since the coriolis field behaves similarly to a magnetic field and tries to break the pairs and to align them along the rotational axis , one originally expected a sudden phase transition from superfluid to normal fluid connected with a strong increase of the moment of inertia .",
    "in fact , in 1971 , the backbending phenomenon was found indicating such an enhancement . however , it turned out that , because of the finiteness of the system , the nucleus contains particles with rather different angular momenta .",
    "pairs in high-@xmath39 intruder orbits break first .",
    "no collective pair collapse is observed , but rather a transition to an aligned two - quasiparticle band .",
    "it turns out that these alignment processes show very interesting details .",
    "the violation of rotational symmetry by the @xmath114-correlations and of gauge symmetry by the @xmath115-correlations goes along with two types or rotational excitations , conventional rotations in @xmath116 and rotations in gauge space@xcite .",
    "they are characterized in a classical way through the angular velocity @xmath7 and the chemical potential @xmath9 .",
    "therefore the intrinsic rotating hfb hamiltonian depends on these two parameters and shows exceptional `` diabolic '' points in its spectrum .",
    "they violate the no - crossing rule and show specific topological properties resulting in non - integrable berry phases .",
    "they follow a very specific pattern in the ( @xmath55)-plane .",
    "the origin of these diabolic points can be understood from the details of the alignment process in the rotating field .",
    "one finds , for the spatial overlap integral between the two single particle wavefunctions , oscillations , as a function of the angular velocity .",
    "they vary with the degree to which the intruder shell is filled in the nucleus and show a very specific pattern , which does not depend on the size of the pairing correlations , but only on the property of the intruder level .",
    "the fact , that the alignment process itself is not properly described in details in this semiclassical intrinsic picture of the cranking model , and that a proper treatment needs angular momentum projection , has no influence on the pattern of diabolic points and its consequences as for instance the sign change of the interaction matrix element between the two bands as well as the sign change of the pair transfer matrix elements and its strong reduction in size in this region ( diabolic pair transfer ) .",
    "all these phenomena also occur in the shell model , where the symmetries are treated properly , and where one deals with wave functions in the laboratory system .    on the experimental side",
    "the pattern of diabolic points has been observed .",
    "it leads to the oscillating behavior of backbending . on the other hand , so far , the strong reduction of pair transfer ( diabolic pair transfer ) as well as quadrupole transition matrix elements in the region of the diabolic points has not been observed uniquely in experiment : the strong reduction of the transition probabilities has , so far , not allowed one to populate these bands beyond the diabolic region  @xcite and to measure the subsequent increase of these transition probabilities",
    ". however , the fact , that one has not been able to populate these states until now is already a strong hint , that diabolic pair transfer exists ."
