    "description of interacting many body quantum system it is a very difficult task .",
    "except of a few rather academic problems exact solutions are not accessible and some approximated methods are necessary .",
    "recent attempts of description of a bose - einstein condensate at finite temperature @xcite-@xcite showed that it is possible to significantly simplify theoretical methods of solving quantum dynamics .",
    "this is due to the assumption of macroscopic occupation of single particle modes .",
    "it is worth noticing that bose - einstein condensate is not the only system with macroscopic occupation of quantum states .",
    "historically the first and the best known system with such properties is electromagnetic field . as long as intensity is large classical approach based on maxwell s equations is valid .",
    "the classical point of view was the only one used until the beginning of the twentieth century .",
    "however this approach turned out to be inadequate to describe experiments with small intensities and therefore the concept of photon had to be introduced . on the other hand , physical phenomena involving macroscopically large field amplitudes ( or equivalently large number of photons ) are successfully described by the classical electric and magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "although quantization of electromagnetic field is a well established procedure , the inverse procedure , i.e. substitution of a quantum field by a classical one is often heuristic and based on physical intuition rather than formal arguments . at this point",
    "we should mention the glauber theory of coherent states @xcite of electromagnetic field .",
    "if the field is in a coherent state then electric and magnetic filed operators can be substituted by their non - vanishing mean values in this state .",
    "these mean values are interpreted as classical fields .",
    "although coherent states provide a link between classical and quantum theories the situation is not that simple in case of particles with non - zero mass .",
    "superselection rules do not allow for superposition of states with different number of particles .",
    "therefore , one can not introduce coherent states for such fields .",
    "such a situation takes place in the case of atomic bose condensates , where the number of particles is fixed .    in bose condensates at low temperatures",
    "only few lowest energy levels are macroscopically occupied .",
    "one might expect that discrete structure of the matter field is not essential and description of the system by a ` classical wave ' should be valid .",
    "this expectation has no rigorous justification .",
    "however an ingenious idea of bogoliubov consisting in substitution of the annihilation operator of a particle in the condensate mode by a c - number amplitude @xcite is extremely successful and widely used .",
    "this approach leads to a mean field description of the system in terms of a classical fields satisfying the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "thus the standard theory of bose condensate at zero temperature is based on the bogoliubov method .",
    "recently this idea was extended to finite temperatures and is called the classical fields method .",
    "it is successful in describing equilibrium properties of bose condensate at finite temperatures , excitations spectrum , dissipative dynamics of vortices and many other finite temperature phenomena @xcite .",
    "the classical fields method is based on heuristic substitution of bose operators by c - number amplitudes",
    ". this substitution can be easily justified at very low temperatures since practically all particles occupy the condensate mode . on the other hand it seems questionable at temperatures close to the critical temperature .",
    "nevertheless the classical fields method works quite well up to the condensation point .",
    "it is known that the bose - einstein condensation is a quantum phenomenon and the critical temperature depends on the planck constant .",
    "the planck constant is usually introduced into theory through commutation relations for the field operators .",
    "those however are violated in the classical fields approach .",
    "nevertheless this approach preserves some bosonic features of the system .",
    "therefore it is justified to ask which features of the quantum system are taken into account in the classical field methods and which assumptions leads to correct prediction of the condensation temperature .",
    "in particular one may ask how does the planck constant enter into the classical field method .    in order to answer these questions , at least partially , we choose the following approach . we start with a classical system of interacting harmonic oscillators and study its dynamics . at a later stage",
    "we include some quantum ingredients and pinpoint the moment where the planck constant appears .",
    "this approach justifies the classical fields method and shows its limitations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the model .",
    "we discuss the numerical techniques that we use and main features of numerical solutions .",
    "a particular form of interactions between oscillators leads to nonlinear equations similar to those studied by fermi , pasta and ulam @xcite . unlike the fermi - pasta - ulam results the dynamics given by our model leads to thermalization of the system . in sec .",
    "iii we analyze the state of thermal equilibrium reached by the system , we study energy equipartition , and define the temperature of the system . in sec .",
    "iv we analyze the system in terms of quasiparticles and occupation of single particle state .",
    "we show that elementary excitations ( phonons ) are distributed according to the low frequency part of bose statistics .",
    "high frequency part is introduced by hand with the help of properly chosen cut - off . in this way",
    "we mimic quantum statistics in the whole range of frequencies . in sec .",
    "v we conclude by summarizing our results and showing their implications for the classical fields method .",
    "in this section we are going to introduce the model and its basic equations .",
    "we consider a one dimensional elastic string of length @xmath0 and linear mass density @xmath1 . in order to find dynamical equations of motion",
    "we divide the string into @xmath2 elements of length @xmath3 and mass @xmath4 .",
    "each element is replaced by a point - like particle interacting with the nearest neighbor via harmonic forces .",
    "the restoring force @xmath5 acting on each particle is proportional to displacement @xmath6 from its equilibrium position , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the young modulus .",
    "thus the string can be viewed as @xmath9 particles moving on a line , each of them connected to two neighbors by a spring with equilibrium length @xmath10 and elastic constant @xmath11 .",
    "we denote equilibrium positions of each particle ( oscillator ) by @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) and their displacements from equilibrium ( along the axis of the string ) by @xmath14 .",
    "the newton equations of motion for the displacements are : @xmath15 for the future convenience we assume periodic boundary conditions , i.e. @xmath16 .",
    "( [ l n e ] ) is used in different areas of physics , e.g. in description of vibration of one - dimensional crystal lattice .",
    "analytic solutions of ( [ l n e ] ) are available in terms of plane waves , @xcite .",
    "let us remark , that in the limit of continuous medium , @xmath17 ( i.e. @xmath18 ) eq.([l n e ] ) takes the form of wave equation : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the velocity of sound . in the language of classical field theories equation",
    "( 1 ) describes free scalar field of zero charge . in the following",
    "we will use the discrete version of the model .",
    "we will now take into account a nonlinearity . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the nonlinear interaction is of short range ( local ) and the dynamical equation is : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a real parameter .",
    "this form of interaction is widely used in various areas of physics , in particular in the so called @xmath23 field theory , @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ nonlinear ] ) is very similar to the one which appears in the famous fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) problem @xcite .",
    "there are , however , two differences .",
    "first , in the fpu case displacements of the first and the last oscillators are set to zero ( as opposed to periodic boundary conditions assumed here ) .",
    "secondly , the nonlinear term in the fpu equation is of a different form .",
    "the authors considered non - local nonlinear forces , for example of the form @xmath24 , where @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",
    "the results of fpu calculations show that the system shows ` very little , if any , tendency toward equipartition of energy among degrees of freedom ' , @xcite . on the contrary , as we are going to show in the following , the system described by eq.([nonlinear ] ) reaches a state of thermal equilibrium characterized by equipartition of energy .",
    "let us introduce natural units : 1 ) unit of length @xmath0 , 2 ) unit of time @xmath27 and 3 ) unit of energy @xmath28 .",
    "the set of coupled nonlinear equations takes the form : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the nonlinear coupling constant .",
    "we assume that @xmath31 , does not depend on @xmath10 . therefore coefficients in eq.([nn n e ] ) do not depend on the number of oscillators @xmath9 .",
    "( [ nn n e ] ) leads to energy conservation : @xmath32=const .",
    "\\label{h}\\ ] ]    we solve the set of equations ( [ nn n e ] ) numerically for various initial energies and various number of oscillators @xmath9 .",
    "all initial displacements @xmath14 and velocities @xmath33 are generated from uniform probability distribution on the interval @xmath34 $ ] , where @xmath35 is a parameter .",
    "its value has to be adjusted according to the value of initial energy .",
    "in general , the larger initial energy the larger the value of @xmath35 . in our numerical simulations",
    "we adjusted the time step , and therefore accuracy of numerical procedure , to ensure energy conservation .    due to",
    "assumed boundary conditions it is convenient to analyze the results of our simulations in the basis of plane waves @xmath36 where the dimensionless wave vector @xmath37 takes the values @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "note that modes with @xmath40 are not present in ( [ ex ] ) .",
    "the cut - off of large @xmath41 is introduced in our model by discretization of space .",
    "we will show that the cut - off position ( or equivalently the number of spatial grid points @xmath9 ) plays a very important role in our description . complex amplitudes of different plane waves @xmath42 are subject to a constrain : @xmath43 because the displacement field @xmath44 is a real function .",
    "this condition is automatically satisfied in numerical implementation .",
    "the most important observation which follows from numerical solutions is that the system reaches a state of equilibrium after some transient time .",
    "we checked this observation by choosing many different initial conditions corresponding to the same initial energy .",
    "the equilibrium state is characterized by randomly - looking oscillations of each plane wave amplitude @xmath45 .",
    "its modulus @xmath46 oscillates in time from zero to some maximal value .",
    "the mode with @xmath47 has the largest amplitude . in general , the larger the wave vector @xmath41 , the smaller the amplitude of oscillations of the corresponding mode .",
    "we will now analyze the stationary state .",
    "it depends on the energy @xmath48 and the number @xmath9 .",
    "let us analyze the frequency spectrum of each plane wave amplitude @xmath49 .",
    "it turns out that the randomly looking oscillations of @xmath50 have a very regular spectrum .",
    "typical frequency spectra of plane wave amplitudes with @xmath51 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ widmo ] .",
    "the spectrum of each mode is composed of two peaks centered around @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the peaks have finite width which is relatively small as compared to the central frequency .",
    "therefore , in the first approximation , it is justified to neglect the width of peaks in the frequency spectrum and assume that each plane wave amplitude oscillates in time with two frequencies .",
    "the frequency @xmath52 is defined as the weighted mean value of frequencies corresponding to the positive frequency peak : @xmath54 while effective amplitude @xmath55 is : @xmath56 in this way we defined an unique frequency @xmath57 and amplitude @xmath58 for every mode @xmath37 .",
    "thus the amplitude @xmath59 has the following time dependence : @xmath60    we checked that the frequencies @xmath57 fulfill the following dispersion relation @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the frequency of the @xmath47 mode .",
    "numerical fit shows that : @xmath63 and @xmath64 is close to @xmath65 . in fig .",
    "[ dyspersja ] we show the dispersion relation obtained from numerical simulations ( points ) and compare it to the analytic formula ( [ f ] ) .",
    "comparison shows remarkably good agreement .    in the continuous limit , where eq .",
    "( [ nn n e ] ) becomes a nonlinear wave equation the @xmath66 term becomes simply @xmath67 .",
    "this difference is due to discretization of space and the simplified form of the discrete version of the second spatial derivative .    in the state of thermal equilibrium",
    "the dispalacment @xmath68 can be approximated by @xmath69 normal modes of the system are plane waves .",
    "every mode @xmath37 oscillates with two opposite frequencies @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "amplitudes corresponding to these frequencies are related , @xmath70 . using the language of the field theory we can say that the positive frequency part corresponds to particle - like modes while the negative frequency component corresponds to antiparticle - like excitations .",
    "the total energy of the interacting system can be expressed in terms of amplitudes @xmath58 and frequencies @xmath57 similarly as in the linear case : @xmath71 factor two which appears in the above formula comes from the fact that each plane wave oscillates with two frequencies of opposite sign and each of them gives the same contribution to the energy .",
    "we check that disagreement between values of energy given by eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) and ( [ h a ] ) is not larger than @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , the total energy is a sum of energies of independent modes .",
    "the hamiltonian expressed in terms of plane waves is diagonal .",
    "one of the most important results of our numerical calculations is that total energy is evenly distributed among all plane wave modes .",
    "the equilibrium state reached during nonlinear evolution is characterized by equipartition of energy : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the energy per mode .",
    "obviously @xmath75 .",
    "( [ ekwipartycja_fig ] ) illustrates the equipartition of energy .",
    "let us remind that no equipartition of energy is observed in fpu problem .",
    "having the equipartition of energy we can define a temperature of the system : @xmath76 where temperature is expressed in unit of @xmath77 ( @xmath78 is the boltzmann constant ) .",
    "in the previous section we have shown that the nonlinear hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) can be expressed in the diagonal form ( [ h a ] ) for each particular state of thermal equilibrium .",
    "note that it can not be done ` globally ' , i.e. independently of the total energy of the system .",
    "this is because the eigenfrequencies depend on the energy .",
    "the diagonal hamiltonian ( [ h a ] ) is a sum of energies of @xmath9 independent harmonic oscillators of frequencies @xmath57 .",
    "the interaction strength @xmath31 enters this hamiltonian through the eigenfrequencies @xmath57 only .",
    "this picture is purely classical . in what follows we will reformulate our results in the language of quantum many body theory .",
    "our goal is to reach a better understanding of foundations of the classical fields method .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h a ] ) can be quantized with the help of canonical quantization procedure , i.e. by defining position and momentum in terms of amplitudes @xmath58 , and then imposing canonical commutation relation between them .",
    "however , bosonic commutation relations are violated in the classical fields method  classical amplitudes do commute .",
    "thus we will choose a different approach .",
    "first we will define dimensionless amplitudes .",
    "these amplitudes are the only dynamical objects appearing in the classical field method . in order to define them we have to rewrite eq.([h",
    "a ] ) using quantities with their proper dimensions : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the frequency and @xmath81 is a classical amplitude of each harmonic oscillator . to define dimensionless",
    "amplitudes we need some _ universal _ quantity which has dimension of an action .",
    "such a quantity does not exist in the classical theory .",
    "therefore we have to introduce this constant by hand .",
    "we will use symbol @xmath82 for this elementary action . at this moment",
    "its value can be arbitrary .",
    "so far we have not mentioned any physical condition which could , at least in principle , determine its value . at a later stage",
    "this constant will be identified with the planck constant .",
    "let us define units of amplitudes : @xmath83 and dimensionless amplitudes for each oscillator : @xmath84 and express the hamiltonian eq.([z jednostkami ] ) in terms of @xmath85 : @xmath86 this form of the hamiltonian eq.([q hamiltonian ] ) is a familiar one .",
    "the energy of each plane wave mode is equal to the energy of elementary quantum of a given frequency @xmath87 times some positive real number : @xmath88 which can be called a number of phonons .",
    "we want to stress once more that number of phonons defined above is not an integer . therefore it can have a physical meaning of the number of quasiparticles only if its value is large as compared to one .",
    "moreover , the value of @xmath89 depends still on the ( arbitrary ) value of the elementary action @xmath82 . because there is no limitation on the maximal amplitude of a harmonic oscillator",
    ", the value of @xmath89 can be arbitrarily large .",
    "our classical field can not therefore correspond to particles obeying fermionic statistics .",
    "however it can correspond to highly excited bose field .",
    "equipartition of energy eqs .",
    "( [ ekwipartycja ] ) , ( [ ekwipartycja 1 ] ) , discussed in the previous section , can be expressed in terms of @xmath90 : @xmath91 where @xmath78 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath92 where @xmath93 is known from our numerical simulations . on the other hands if @xmath89 corresponds to the number of phonons ( in the ` classical limit ' ) than in the thermal equilibrium it should obey bose statistics : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a chemical potential . in the limit of low frequencies",
    "@xmath87 , the equilibrium occupation of the mode @xmath37 can be approximated by : @xmath96 comparison of eq .",
    "( [ temp ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ ekwi ] ) shows that occupation of normal modes obtained in our calculations agrees with a low frequency limit of bose statistics provided that @xmath97 .",
    "equipartition of energy defines the energy per mode .",
    "all modes with wave vectors @xmath98 are occupied by phonons while other modes are empty because of the momentum cut - off used in the implementation of the model .",
    "this distribution of energy is a @xmath99 analogue of the planck distribution of the blackbody radiation .",
    "the planck distribution says that energy density grows with frequency up to some maximal value and then falls exponentially to zero .",
    "this initial growth is related to the phase space volume which increases with @xmath37 as @xmath100 and is absent in the @xmath99 model studied here .",
    "the exponential decay of the blackbody energy density in replaced by a sharp cut - off at @xmath101 in our calculations .",
    "we will use the similarities described above to determine the value of @xmath82 which will allow us to find the absolute value of the number of phonons @xmath90 . following the planck idea",
    "we determine the value of @xmath82 by equating the temperature of the system to the energy corresponding to the position of the maximum in the energy distribution . in our case",
    "this ` maximum ' corresponds to the cut - off : @xmath102 eq .",
    "( [ hbar ] ) plays a crucial role in establishing a link between classical fields approach and the quantum theory of bose system .",
    "it gives the value of the planck constant up to a numerical factor of the order of one .",
    "this fact establishes a limitation of accuracy of the method , in particular the accuracy of the number of particles , or equivalently the value of the temperature of the system . by comparing eq.([hbar ] ) and eq.([ekwi ] ) we see that number of particles occupying the mode with the largest energy is equal to one : @xmath103 this means that occupation of all modes with @xmath37 smaller than @xmath104 is macroscopic , @xmath105 , which is in agreement with a common understanding of the classical limit of the quantum field . indeed in",
    "the classical fields method the number of modes used in numerical implementation has to be carefully adjusted .",
    "as suggested in @xcite it should be such that the occupation of the highest mode is equal to 1 .    in what follows",
    "we give an illustrative example of application of the defined above procedure of ` quantization of a scalar field ' studied in this paper .",
    "we solve the dynamical equations for various total energy of the system and various number of grid points @xmath9 . in our calculations we used rather small values of @xmath9 ranging from @xmath106 up to @xmath107 .",
    "we check if the system reached the state of thermal equilibrium by determining a frequency spectrum @xmath52 and amplitudes @xmath55 at various stages of time evolution .",
    "when the stationary state is reached we control equipartition of energy and determine the temperture .",
    "finally , occupation of different eigenmodes is obtained from the following relation : @xmath108 evidently @xmath109 , what is equivalent to the condition ( [ hbar ] ) . if total number of phonons @xmath110 is different than assumed we have to repeat the calculations changing the number of grid points . in general",
    "the smaller the energy the smaller @xmath9 has to be used in order to keep the same number of phonons .",
    "this way we are able to get occupations of all normal modes as functions of temperature for a fixed total number of phonons .    in fig.([1d ] ) we present occupation of @xmath47 mode as a function of temperature for nonlinear interaction strength @xmath111 and two different total number of phonons .",
    "the solid line represents a fit to the numerical results .",
    "the results show that relative occupation of the spatially uniform @xmath47 mode grows quite rapidly at temperatures close to zero .",
    "there is no phase transition in the studied system because , first of all , our system is one - dimensional , and also elementary excitations are massless .",
    "the main goal of these calculations was to illustrate how the classical field method works in practice .",
    "in this paper we started from the description of a purely classical system .",
    "our numerical simulations proved that nonlinear interactions drive the system towards an equilibrium .",
    "energy in the equilibrium is evenly distributed among all modes of @xmath112 .",
    "modes corresponding to @xmath40 are not excited and do not contribute to the total energy .",
    "they are absent in our approach because of the cut - off which is an essential ingredient of the method . in order to ` quantize ' the dynamics we introduced the planck constant .",
    "then we could define dimensionless amplitudes of each oscillator and the number of excitation quanta of each mode  phonons .",
    "however , the number of phonons depends on the value of @xmath82 which , at this stage of the approach , can be arbitrary . in order to assign a value to @xmath82 we followed the planck s idea .",
    "we used the fact that planck s distribution of energy leads to its equipartition for small values of @xmath37 and exponential drop for large @xmath37 .",
    "energy distribution reaches a maximum at frequency @xmath113 close to this satisfying the relation @xmath114 . in our approach",
    "the same condition was used to determine the value of @xmath82 and thus the number of phonons @xmath115 .",
    "we believe that our studies shed more light on the classical fields method used for description of a weakly interacting bose - einstein condensate .",
    "the way of reasoning goes the opposite way in ` derivation ' of this method .",
    "one starts with quantum many body theory of a bose gas with short range interactions .",
    "two particle interaction energy is @xmath116 where @xmath117 is proportional to the s - wave scattering length and @xmath118 is the volume .",
    "the number of macroscopically occupied modes is being assumed _ a priori _ by choosing a value of the cut - off momentum @xmath104 .",
    "annihilation operators of these selected modes are then substituted by classical amplitudes @xmath119 and heisenberg operator equations transform into equations for classical amplitudes @xmath120 : @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the total number of particles .",
    "this quantity corresponds to the number @xmath115 of phonons i the discussed classical model .",
    "note that @xmath122 does not enter dynamical equations alone  it is multiplied by the interaction strength @xmath117 .",
    "relative occupation of different @xmath37 modes is closely related to the classical amplitudes : @xmath123 let us observe that the planck constant appears in the equations right from the beginning .",
    "but its value can be _ arbitrary _  the classical amplitudes @xmath119 are a direct analogue of amplitudes @xmath85 of our model .",
    "dynamics of classical fields leads to the equipartition of energy : @xmath124 only the value of @xmath125 is known from numerical calculations , therefore ( [ xxx ] ) allows for determination of the ratio of @xmath126 but not the values of @xmath127 , @xmath128 separately .",
    "note that both @xmath128 and @xmath117 are not uniquely determined because only product @xmath129 is an initial control parameter .",
    "according to the present studies this problem can be resolved if the value of @xmath82 is determined by the requirement that the energy distribution of classical fields mimics the quantum distribution  the position of maximum ought to be approximately given by @xmath130 this equation together with the equipartition relation allows for determination of the particle number : @xmath131 in the classical fields method the above condition is justified on a basis of heuristic arguments by saying that all classical modes have to be macroscopically occupied .",
    "the approach we used gives a new interpretation of this reasoning .",
    "moreover , our studies show limits of the ` predictive power ' of the classical fields method .",
    "because the planck constant is determined with limited accuracy all predictions about the total number of particles or temperature of the system are accurate up to a numerical factor of the order of one .",
    "it seems therefore that attempts of more accurate determination of the temperature @xcite can not be free of the ambiguity related to the position of the cut - off .",
    "in addition the classical fields method can not be used for description of very subtle effects such as a shift of the critical temperature of bose - einstein condensation due to interactions . for a typical system",
    "this shift is very small .",
    "some efforts @xcite of obtaining the shift of critical temperature using classical fields method must be inevitably biased by the approximate character of eq.([planck ] ) .",
