    "recent interest in topological aspects of electron states has led to a large number of experimental and theoretical works .",
    "the study of the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) @xcite has developed the idea of the adiabatic geometric phase to understand their topological properties .",
    "the most remarkable one is that it is dissipationless transport because a dissipative longitudinal current vanishes in the qh phase .",
    "however such a dissipationless transport is not only the hall current .",
    "actually , in a time reversal broken system , a dissipationless viscosity coefficient related to transverse momentum transport can be discussed @xcite while the conductivity corresponds to charge transport .",
    "it is called `` asymmetric viscosity '' @xcite , `` hall viscosity '' @xcite , and also `` lorentz shear modulus '' @xcite . to obtain the hall viscosity",
    ", we can use the kubo formula with a correlation function of a stress tensor as well as the dissipative shear viscosity .",
    "it means that the viscosity indicates a response to a metric perturbation . on the other hand , as the case of the hall conductivity , the hall viscosity is also given by the berry curvature on the parameter space . for the viscosity , it turns out to be the moduli space of the torus @xcite , while we should consider the brillouin zone for the conductivity @xcite .",
    "it reflects that the metric of the system can be parametrized by the modulus of the torus .    in earlier works , mainly",
    "the hall viscosity of the lowest landau level ( lll ) has been computed for non - interacting @xcite and interacting electron states , such as the laughlin state and generalized conformal blocks @xcite .",
    "they correspond to the integer qhe ( iqhe ) and the fractional qhe ( fqhe ) , respectively .",
    "the adiabatic property for the higher ll state has been actually considered in @xcite , but the connection with the hall viscosity has not been explicitly referred in that paper .",
    "all the previous results are restricted to the non - relativistic systems although there are various applications of the relativistic dirac fermion in the context of condensed - matter physics . thus in this paper",
    "we will discuss the hall viscosity of the dirac fermion , and consider applications to graphene @xcite and topological insulators @xcite , which have been remarkable topics in recent years .    to discuss topological insulator models",
    ", we will start with haldane s zero - field qh model @xcite . in the topological phase of the haldane model , which turns out to be @xmath0 qh phase , density of states itself vanishes because no net external magnetic field is applied to this model .",
    "indeed incompressible electron fluid can not be realized since there are no landau levels . as a result",
    ", the hall viscosity also goes to zero even in the topological phase because viscosity is the hydrodynamical quantity , and proportional to the density or the magnetic field .",
    "it means that the naive definition of the hall viscosity can not capture the topological property of the haldane model .",
    "thus we have to consider a novel viscosity associated with one - particle state , which can characterize the topological phase of the haldane model , analogous to the filling fraction .",
    "it will be shown that a hint to resolve this difficulty can be found in string theory .",
    "recent progress of string theory has provided us with a remarkable method to approach the strongly correlated system , which is called _ ads / cft correspondence _",
    "indeed there are a large number of applications ranging from particle physics to condensed - matter physics .",
    "then the shear viscosity for the strongly coupled system was actually calculated in @xcite , and universal behavior of the viscosity to entropy density ratio , @xmath1 , was proposed in @xcite .",
    "it suggests that a ratio of viscosity is more fundamental quantity than viscosity itself , thus we will consider a ratio for the hall viscosity and discuss some analogous properties .",
    "recently it has been shown that the topological phase can be observed even in the time reversal invariant systems @xcite , which is characterized by @xmath2 invariant @xcite .",
    "its discovery has a significant influence on both of experimental and theoretical sides of condensed - matter physics .",
    "the effective theory of such a system is well described by the dirac fermion , and thus we will also generalize the discussion of the hall viscosity to the time reversal invariant systems . however , as discussed in @xcite , the hall viscosity is observed only in the time reversal broken system .",
    "thus we will consider another kind of viscosity in such a system , which is analogous to the spin hall conductivity .",
    "we will show it characterizes a stress induced by a spin current while the hall viscosity gives the relation for a current of particles .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way .",
    "we begin in section [ sec : visco ] with the theory of dirac fermion as preliminaries to discuss topological insulators , and then its application to graphene system is discussed . in section [ sec :",
    "ratio ] we treat topological insulator models with / without time reversal symmetry .",
    "we introduce a novel quantity , a ratio for the hall viscosity , to discuss these models , and some common properties with a similar quantity , which is considered in the context of ads / cft correspondence .",
    "we also discuss a spin hall analogue of the viscosity ratio in the time reversal invariant systems .",
    "section [ sec : summary ] is devoted to summary and discussions .",
    "let us start with how to calculate the hall viscosity .",
    "as the case of the usual dissipative viscosity , the hall viscosity is obtained by response to metric perturbation , which is related to the shear stress mode .",
    "we now introduce the metric perturbation as follows : @xmath3 here @xmath4 is a complex form of the perturbation parameter , which is interpreted as the modulus of the torus , and @xmath5 stands for the inverse of @xmath6 .",
    "the euclidean metric is recovered with @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "then the stress tensor is given by response to the metric perturbation , @xmath10 .",
    "according to the kubo formula , one obtains the usual viscosity from a correlation function of @xmath11 \\right\\rangle$ ] .",
    "furthermore , in the presence of external magnetic field , the time reversal symmetry of the system is broken , and thus another transport coefficient can be considered @xcite , which we call _ hall viscosity_.    the hall viscosity is actually given by correlators , such as @xmath12 \\right\\rangle$ ] .",
    "however it is shown in @xcite that the quantity is related to the berry curvature on the moduli space of the metric perturbation parameters @xmath13 , while the hall conductivity is given by that on the momentum space .",
    "the hall viscosity is given by @xmath14 to recover the physical units , it is required to multiply the factor of @xmath15 .",
    "this is just a contribution of an eigenstate @xmath16 to the viscosity , where @xmath17 denotes a label of the particle state , e.g. the landau level index . in general",
    ", we should consider a whole contribution of all the eigenstaes under the fermi surface .",
    "here we remark the difference between the hall viscosity and conductivity .",
    "the hall conductivity is quantized because it is given by the integral over the brillouin zone of the berry curvature @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the curvature on the specific point , corresponding to the euclidean metric , is required for computing the hall viscosity of the unperturbed state .",
    "this means that the hall viscosity is not given by the integral of the curvature , and is not expected to be quantized .      as a preliminary to discuss the topological insulator models ,",
    "we now consider the hall viscosity of the two dimensional dirac fermion model with external magnetic field .",
    "the unperturbed dirac hamiltonian is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the fermi velocity .",
    "to consider the modification of ( [ dirac01 ] ) under the metric perturbation ( [ metric01 ] ) , we should find a representation of the clifford algebra satisfying @xmath20 .",
    "the metric ( [ metric01 ] ) can be written with the `` zweibein '' , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the euclidean metric . in the matrix form , it becomes @xmath23 this helps us to obtain the representation of the clifford algebra : they are given by a linear combination of the pauli matrices , @xmath24 hence the dirac hamiltonian with the metric ( [ metric01 ] ) yields @xmath25 this is just the dirac operator in a flat , but non - standard metric spacetime ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    to discuss the landau quantization for this model ,",
    "let us take into account the magnetic field .",
    "we choose the landau gauge @xmath26 , and thus the momentum is modified as @xmath27 .",
    "then the hamiltonian becomes @xmath28 with @xmath29 . here",
    "the creation and annihilation operators , satisfying @xmath30=1 $ ] , are defined as @xmath31    we then search for eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ dirac02 ] ) .",
    "the dirac zero mode , corresponding to the lll state , is obtained by the equation of @xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath17 labels the degenerated lll state , @xmath33 , because the magnetic field is quantized as @xmath34 .",
    "then the higher ll states are also given by @xmath35 hence the eigenvalues and the eigenstates of the hamiltonian yield @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 where the normalization condition for the ll state is given by @xmath39 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the lll wavefunction can be written in a form of @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the theta function depending on either of @xmath42 or @xmath43 .",
    "the property of the theta function yields the normalization constant @xmath44 .",
    "in general , the berry curvature on the moduli space is related to the holomorphic structure of the eigenstate .",
    "actually the lll state consists of the ( anti-)holomorphic and non - holomorphic parts .",
    "the latter one is just the normalization factor depending on both of @xmath42 and @xmath43 . as a result",
    ", it is shown that the contribution to the curvature comes only from the normalization factor @xcite .",
    "actually the zero mode , in this case , turns out to be anti - holomorphic function of @xmath43 . according to the berry curvature of the lls obtained in @xcite",
    ", we obtain that of the eigenstates of ( [ dirac03 ] ) , @xmath45 @xmath46 therefore the hall viscosity is obtained from the curvature on the moduli space with the degeneracy of each ll state .",
    "the ll state is @xmath47-fold degenerated , but the zero mode turns out to be half filled because of the parity anomaly @xcite .",
    "thus contributions to the hall viscosity coming from the curvature ( [ curvature01 ] ) is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the density of particles and the magnetic length is defined by @xmath50 .",
    "we remark the result ( [ visco01 ] ) depends on the level index @xmath51 , while the contribution to the hall conductivity does not .",
    "it has been shown this level dependence indeed reproduces the classical result @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the cyclotron frequency @xcite .",
    "the most desirable application of the relativistic @xmath54-dimensional dirac fermion theory in condensed - matter systems might be the graphene system @xcite .",
    "the low energy behavior of graphene is well described by two dirac fermions at two valleys , @xmath55 and @xmath56 points , and each valley has _ up _ and _ down _ spin degrees of freedom .",
    "hence we often treat it as the four flavor dirac fermion system .",
    "indeed the anomalous qhe of graphene is well explained by the four flavor theory @xcite .",
    "we shall discuss the hall viscosity of the graphene system .",
    "first of all , it should be noted , as discussed in @xcite , it might be nonsense for the system where translational symmetry is violated at short length scales , since viscosity is the transport coefficient related to momentum transport . therefore we have to consider the system such that it is well described by the continuum effective theory , i.e. the magnetic length , which characterizes the extent of the wavefunction , is much larger than the lattice spacing @xmath57 of the system .",
    "furthermore , in the case of graphene , we also deal with the low energy region where the dirac fermion description is suitable .",
    "we then introduce the effective hamiltonian for the monolayer graphene @xcite , @xmath58 where the cyclotron frequency for this system is defined as @xmath59 , and @xmath60 is the hopping amplitude between the nearest neighbor sites . here",
    "the annihilation / creation operators are defined as @xmath61 , @xmath62 satisfying @xmath63=\\xi$ ] where @xmath64 and @xmath65 refer to the @xmath55 and @xmath56 valleys , respectively .",
    "this is just the model discussed in section [ sec : dirac ] , and we can apply the result of the dirac fermion to this system by considering the metric perturbation .",
    "however , since the dirac zero mode is shared by both of @xmath55 and @xmath56 valleys reflecting the anomaly , we must not doubly count the contribution of the zero mode .",
    "hence the hall viscosity of the graphene system yields @xmath66 for @xmath67 .",
    "the sign corresponds to whether it is associated with particle states or hole states as the anomalous hall conductivity of the graphene @xcite . on the other hand , in the non - interacting and non - relativistic system",
    ", it becomes @xmath68 for @xmath69 , since the contribution of each ll is given by @xmath70 for @xmath71 , as shown in @xcite .",
    "in this section we then apply the argument of the hall viscosity to some topological insulators @xcite .",
    "all the topological insulator models have a band gap , but there are some ways to generate a gap : it is generated by magnetic field in a time reversal symmetry broken system , and spin - orbit interaction causes it in a time reversal symmetric system .",
    "although the origin of the gap is different , indeed topological aspects of such systems are well described by the effective dirac fermion model discussed in section [ sec : visco ] .",
    "first we consider the model proposed by haldane @xcite .",
    "the remarkable property of this model is that the topological phase is caused by only breaking time reversal symmetry while there is no net external magnetic flux .",
    "indeed it is shown that anomalous contribution of the dirac zero mode , relating to the parity anomaly , plays an important role in it .",
    "now let us discuss how to obtain the hall conductivity for the model without external magnetic field .",
    "it is given by a derivative of charge density with respect to magnetic flux , @xmath72 , which is called widom - steda formula @xcite and available even in the zero field limit .",
    "it can be interpreted as lhopital s rule to evaluate an indeterminate form of the filling fraction in the limit of @xmath73 .",
    "indeed the charge density becomes @xmath74 by taking into account infinitesimal magnetic field in a certain phase of the haldane model .",
    "therefore it turns out to be @xmath0 qh phase .",
    "we then consider the hall viscosity of the topological phase in the haldane model . according to the result of the dirac fermion model discussed in section [ sec : visco ]",
    ", it yields @xmath75 in the topological phase with infinitesimal magnetic flux .",
    "we now remark that not charge , but particle number density is used in the expression of the hall viscosity ( [ visco01 ] ) .",
    "however , taking the zero field limit , the hall viscosity goes to zero as the particle density vanishes .",
    "this reflects that viscosity is the hydrodynamical quantity which depends on the density . in the haldane model the incompressible fluid state on the lls can not be found , and thus the naive definition of the hall viscosity can not capture the topological property of the model . to resolve this difficulty , we now introduce a novel quantity , a ratio of the hall viscosity to particle density , @xmath76 this is similar quantity to _ kinematic viscosity _ , which is defined as the ratio of viscosity to mass density .",
    "the reason why we prefer the quantity ( [ visco02 ] ) to kinematic viscosity is that it is not well defined for the massless dirac fermion . hence , by using lhopital s rule as the case of the hall conductivity in the zero field limit , which can be interpreted as alternative formula for the hall viscosity ratio of widom - steda formula , we see that it can takes non - zero value , @xmath77 in this sense , it stands for @xmath78 with effective one - particle spin @xmath79 because the hall viscosity is represented as @xmath80 @xcite",
    ".    we now comment universal behavior of the hall viscosity for the lll state .",
    "the hall viscosity of the lll state , which is discussed in @xcite , and that of the dirac zero mode shown in ( [ visco01 ] ) are given by @xmath81 , yielding @xmath82 .",
    "furthermore it is shown in @xcite that the hall viscosity of @xmath83 laughlin state becomes @xmath84 with @xmath85 .",
    "although the value of the hall viscosity itself is different from the above , after all dependence on the magnetic field provides the universal value , @xmath86 . on the other hand , this universality is not observed in the excited state . indeed the hall viscosity for more generalized conformal blocks is obtained in @xcite , @xmath87 , with a conformal weight @xmath88 .",
    "similarly , the @xmath51-th ll state gives @xmath89 as discussed before .",
    "these results give a larger value of the ratio @xmath90 compared with the lll state because an excited state has higher spin .",
    "we also remark similarity of the hall viscosity ratio @xmath91 to the viscosity to entropy density ratio , @xmath92 .",
    "according to ads / cft correspondence , the usual dissipative viscosity for the strongly coupled system is obtained in @xcite , and its universal behavior , @xmath93 , called _ kss bound _ , is discussed in @xcite . in the context of ads",
    "/ cft , the hawking temperature of the black hole is interpreted as that of the dual field theory at boundary .",
    "although the temperature goes to zero in the extremal black hole limit , the residual entropy is observed in some cases .",
    "actually it is discussed in @xcite that this universality is still available in the extremal case , corresponding to the zero temperature limit although the entropy also goes to zero in the limit . on the other hand ,",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the kss bound can be violated in generalized holographic model , e.g. gauss - bonnet gravity , which includes higher order curvature terms . in the case of hall viscosity , the shift of the hall viscosity , coming from the effect of the geometry , is also pointed out @xcite .",
    "these results suggest the geometrical effect should not be neglected for arguments on viscosity .",
    "as discussed above , there are some common properties in both of the viscosity ratios .",
    "however these universal behaviors mean that viscosity itself might not be universal quantities .",
    "the reason why is the natural unit of the viscosity should be @xmath94 times density as discussed in @xcite .",
    "this density dependence suggests viscosity relates to the characteristic scale of the system , e.g. the magnetic length .",
    "thus it is preferred that we consider the ratio of quantities rather than viscosity itself .",
    "it is well known that the hall conductivity occurs if and only if time reversal symmetry is broken . as the case of conductivity ,",
    "it is pointed out in @xcite that the hall viscosity can be also observed in a system without time reversal symmetry . on the other hand , spin hall conductivity induced by spin - orbit interaction",
    "is found in time reversal symmetric systems @xcite .",
    "we then consider application of the idea of the hall viscosity to the time reversal system , and spin hall analogue of viscosity .",
    "the most fundamental model for the topological insulator with time reversal symmetry is the kane - mele model , which is proposed in @xcite . in this model",
    "the spin - orbit interaction is taken into account on honeycomb lattice , which corresponds to the next nearest neighbor ( nnn ) hopping term of the haldane model .",
    "thus the kane - mele model can be interpreted as the _ doubled _ haldane model , because the signs of the nnn hopping amplitude is opposite for up and down spins .",
    "actually the time reversal symmetry of the haldane model is explicitly broken , which is equivalent to up / down spin sector of the kane - mele model .",
    "however the kane - mele model preserves the time reversal symmetry by considering both of up and down spin sectors .",
    "hence a quantized hall conductivity of the haldane model induces a spin current , @xmath95 , thus it yields a spin hall conductivity @xmath96 . in this sense",
    ", we can consider spin hall analogue of the hall viscosity ratio @xmath97 which we will call _ spin hall viscosity ratio_. as the case of the haldane model , the quantity ( [ visco04 ] ) is just for the one - particle state .",
    "although some generalizations of topological insulators for correlated electron systems have been considered @xcite , an effect of many - body interaction is not yet obvious .",
    "if certain aspects of highly correlated topological insulators are understood , we would be able to discuss the spin hall viscosity for such systems .",
    "we then study a physical meaning of the spin hall viscosity . in the presence of magnetic field and a current the hall viscosity gives a relation between the current and the stress tensor , @xmath98 , where @xmath99 stands for the current in @xmath100-direction @xcite .",
    "in the case of the spin hall system , it corresponds to @xmath101 where @xmath102 represents @xmath100-component of a spin current .",
    "this means the spin current induces the stress in the kane - mele model as shown in fig .",
    "[ stress_fig ] while the charge current does not .",
    "it is dissipationless because the stress is perpendicular to the current as the cases of hall and spin hall conductivity .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the hall and spin hall viscosity in some topological insulator models . in section [ sec : visco ]",
    "the metric perturbation for the dirac fermion model is studied .",
    "the berry curvature on the moduli space , which gives the hall viscosity of the dirac fermion , is computed , and its application to the graphene system is also discussed . in section [ sec :",
    "ratio ] we have proposed the novel quantity , the hall viscosity to particle density ratio , to study the viscosity of haldane s zero - field model for qhe .",
    "it is analogous to the ratio of viscosity to entropy density , which is discussed in the context of ads / cft correspondence , and some common properties are found .",
    "we have also studied the spin hall viscosity of the kane - mele model .",
    "although the hall viscosity is observed only in the time reversal broken systems , the spin hall viscosity can be found even in the time reversal invariant systems .",
    "it is then pointed out that the spin current induces the dissipationless stress in the topological phase of the kane - mele model .",
    "we now comment some open problems on this topic .",
    "one of them is the relation between the hall viscosity and the edge state .",
    "it is well known that the edge state plays an important roll on the transport phenomena in the qh and qsh systems : the hall conductivity is actually obtained by different ways , due to the bulk / edge correspondence @xcite . in this sense , the hall viscosity should be computed from the edge state .",
    "next is a generalization to the three dimensional topological insulators , which are also characterized by @xmath2 invariant @xcite , e.g. the fu - kane - mele model @xcite .",
    "three dimensional anomalous viscosity induced by the external field was indeed considered in @xcite , and its classical computation was also given .",
    "since the surface state of the three dimensional model can be described by dirac fermions , the results discussed in this paper would be related to it .",
    "furthermore the four dimensional generalization would be also discussed . the anomalous contribution in the four dimensional hydrodynamics",
    "is recently considered in @xcite .",
    "it is related to the triangle anomaly , and corresponds to the non - linear response coefficient . indeed , in the four dimensional qh system @xcite , the non - linear coefficient is quantized while the linear part is not .",
    "therefore it is expected that the four dimensional anomalous contribution can be found in the four dimensional qh system ."
