    "ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are point - like , accreting x - ray sources with apparent isotropic luminosities @xmath9 a few @xmath10 erg s@xmath1 , that is , greater than the eddington limit of a stellar - mass black hole ( bh ) .",
    "their nature remains unexplained .",
    "in particular , for the large majority of ulxs , two fundamental questions remain unsolved : whether the emission is isotropic or beamed towards the observer ( either as a mild geometrical beaming , or as a collimated , relativistic jet ) ; and whether the accreting compact objects are young , perhaps formed in recent starburst episodes , or are instead old relics of a primordial stellar population .",
    "studying the ulx counterparts at other wavelengths may offer clues on their ages , mechanisms of formation , isotropic luminosities ( through their effect on the interstellar medium ) and sources of fuel .",
    "in particular , it has recently become clear that there is a strong connection between x - ray and radio properties of accreting bhs .",
    "this connection has been successfully applied to bh x - ray binaries in our galaxy , providing a physical interpretation to their state transitions ( fender , belloni & gallo 2005 ) .",
    "similar studies for accreting bhs in nearby galaxies ( e.g. , fender , southwell & tzioumis 1998 ) are , however , hampered by the faintness of the radio counterparts .",
    "the ulx in the nearby ( @xmath11 mpc : karachentsev et al .",
    "2002 ) dwarf starburst galaxy ngc5408 ( henceforth , x-1 ) is an ideal test case for our study .",
    "its position is known to @xmath12 , from a series of _ chandra _ observations .",
    "the source is among the brightest ulxs in the local universe , with an isotropic x - ray luminosity @xmath13 erg s@xmath1 in the @xmath14@xmath15 kev band . always detected in an active state also by _",
    "einstein _ , _ rosat _ and _ xmm - newton _",
    ", x-1 has shown a pattern of flux variability over a few weeks or months ( kaaret et al .",
    "2003 ) , as well as on shorter timescales ( soria et al .",
    "2004 ) , inconsistent with an x - ray supernova remnant ( snr ) .",
    "thus , there is no doubt that the x - ray emission is due to accretion onto a compact object .",
    "most importantly , it is one of the very few ulxs with a radio counterpart ( kaaret et al .",
    "the possibility that it is a background object ( radio galaxy or quasar ) can be ruled out due to the extremely high x - ray to optical flux ratio ( kaaret et al .",
    "2003 ) ; a background blazar is also very unlikely , because their radio spectral indices are much flatter than determined for this source ( kaaret et al .",
    "2003 and section 2 of this work ) .",
    "two alternative scenarios have been suggested for x-1 ( kaaret et al .",
    "2003 ; soria et al .",
    "it could be a stellar - mass microblazar ( i.e. , a microquasars with its relativistic jet oriented along our line of sight ) . in this case",
    ", its extreme brightness would be due to doppler boosting ; its radio emission would be synchrotron from the jet ; its x - ray spectrum could be produced by synchrotron self - compton or external compton scattering of low - energy photons ( including uv / optical photons from the disk or the donor star ) by the relativistic jet ( krding , falcke & markoff 2002 ; georganopoulos , aharonian & kirk 2002 ; georganopoulos & kazanas 2003 ) .",
    "alternatively , the x - ray emission could be isotropic , implying a mass @xmath16 for the accreting bh , if the eddington limit is not persistently violated . applying conventional phenomenological models ,",
    "the @xmath14@xmath17 kev spectrum is dominated by a rapidly - varying power - law component with photon index @xmath18 , plus a non - varying soft thermal component or `` soft excess '' ( @xmath19 kev ) , often found in ulxs .",
    "we re - observed the system in the radio , with a more extended spectral coverage ( four instead of two bands ) , to measure its spectral index , and to determine whether there has been a long - term variation in the radio flux compared with the previous observations in march 2000 ( stevens , forbes & norris 2002 ) . using these new results , we want to determine whether the radio emission is coming directly from the accreting bh ( for example , from a relativistic jet ) or is instead",
    "only spatially associated with it ( for example , it may come from an underlying snr ) . in either case",
    ", we shall obtain important information on the geometry of emission or on the immediate environment of the ulx .",
    "more generally , we want to determine whether the associated radio and x - ray emissions in x-1 are consistent with the correlations found in galactic bh binaries , as a function of spectral state ( fender et al .",
    "we observed ngc5408 on 2004 december 911 , with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , located at narrabri , new south wales .",
    "the array was in the 6-km configuration .",
    "two sets of observations were carried out : simultaneously at 1.344 ghz ( 20 cm ) and 2.638 ghz ( 13 cm ) ; and simultaneously at 4.840 ghz ( 6 cm ) and 6.208 ghz ( 5 cm ) , with a continuum bandwidth of 128 mhz .",
    "observations of the target galaxy were alternated with those of the primary flux calibrator pksb1934@xmath20638 , and of the secondary phase calibrator pksb1320@xmath20446 . in total , we had about 13 hr spent on source for each of the two configurations .",
    "the data were processed and analysed using the miriad package ( sault , teuben & wright 1995 ) .",
    "images were cleaned with 1000 iterations of gain 0.1 .",
    "the clearest image of the radio counterpart to the ulx is available at 4.8 ghz ( figure 1 ) , in which the source is clearly resolved from the nearby starburst and has a flux density of @xmath21 mjy ( consistent with kaaret et al .",
    "the best - fit radio coordinates of the source associated with the ulx , obtained from the peak of the emission in the 4.8 ghz map , is r.a .",
    "= @xmath22 , dec = @xmath23 with an error @xmath24 .",
    "this is consistent ( within @xmath25 ) with the x - ray position of the ulx ( r.a .",
    "= @xmath26 , dec = @xmath23 ; kaaret et al .",
    "2003 ) , which we also re - checked by analysing the _ chandra _ observations available in the public archive .    from the images at other wavelengths it was immediately apparent that the relative faintness of the target , combined with its proximity to the starburst region , was resulting in strong uncertainties in the measured flux density . in order to quantify this ,",
    "we have varied the beam size at each frequency by adjusting briggs robust parameter between -2 and + 2 , corresponding to a smooth transition from uniform ( highest angular resolution , lowest signal - to - noise ) to natural ( lowest angular resolution , highest signal to noise ) . for each resultant map",
    "we have fit a point source model , with the coordinates fixed to those established from the 4.8 ghz map .",
    "the variation of the apparent source flux as a function of beam size , for each frequency , is presented in figure 2 .",
    "beam size is clearly a strong effect at 1.3 and 2.4 ghz , less so at 4.8 ghz and has no significant effect at 6.2 ghz : hence , it is hard to confidently ascribe a well measured flux density to the radio counterpart of the ulx , particularly at low frequencies .",
    "a 4.8-ghz radio flux density of @xmath27 mjy corresponds to a radio luminosity of @xmath28 erg s@xmath1 . as noted above",
    ", the measured flux is consistent with the 4.8-ghz flux inferred from the march 2000 atca observations ( kaaret et al .",
    "2003 ; stevens et al .",
    "2002 ) , suggesting that the source has not varied significantly between the two epochs .    between the highest two frequencies , the marginal detection at 6.2 ghz ( in the naturally weighted maps , the point source fit at the position fixed from the 4.8 ghz image is @xmath29 mjy ) suggests at face value a very steep spectrum with spectral index @xmath30 , and we use @xmath31 or @xmath32 to avoid confusion between the radio and x - ray spectral slopes . using the notation",
    "more commonly adopted in x - ray studies , the x - ray photon index @xmath33 . ] .",
    "this is an extreme value for synchrotron emission : it may suggest that the break due to ageing of the electron populations is located between those two bands .",
    "we shall discuss  and essentially rule out  this possibility in section 3.6 .",
    "alternatively , it may be taken as a hint that we are starting to resolve the source at those higher frequencies , which would imply a characteristic size @xmath34 , or @xmath35 pc at the assumed distance of ngc5408 . at lower frequencies ,",
    "contamination by the flux from the starburst starts to dominate .",
    "this makes determining the radio spectrum associated with the ulx problematic .    in another approach to estimate the radio spectral index at the ulx position and in the surrounding region , we obtained radio images of the field by combining the 1.3 and 2.4 ghz maps ( figure 3 , top panel ) and the 4.8 and 6.2 ghz maps ( figure 3 , bottom panel ) .",
    "the radio source associated with the ulx clearly stands out as a discrete ( and possibly resolved ) blob in the combined high - frequency map , with hints of emission trailing back to the nearby bright starburst region . in the low - frequency map",
    ", there is clearly radio emission at the ulx location , apparently as the end of an elongated region emanating from the starburst complex , but our spatial resolution is not sufficient for a more detailed analysis .",
    "we then took the ratio of the low - frequency and high - frequency maps ( figure 4 ) . from this , we note that the bright starburst region is clearly strongly resolved out on its outer edges , which is why the spectral index in these regions appears steeper than @xmath36 .",
    "instead , both the core of the starburst region and the site of the ulx are not resolved out , and have spectral indices @xmath2 between these two combined bands .",
    "so , while a qualitative approach based on the measured flux densities at four frequencies for the ulx is problematic , there is strong evidence that the radio emission at the site of the ulx has a steep spectral index , consistent with optically - thin synchrotron emission , and in agreement with the march 2000 observations ( kaaret et al .",
    "incidentally , the flux - ratio map also suggests that the radio emission in the core of the starburst region is dominated by snrs ( steep spectrum ) rather than free - free emission from h regions ( flat spectrum ) .",
    "given that the evidence for a spatially resolved radio source is still only marginal , we shall consider both the scenario of a point - like source ( core emission ) and that of an extended source .",
    "we start by considering the possibility that the radio emission is directly produced by the accreting bh , on spatial scales comparable to the accretion disk .",
    "radio emission from galactic bh x - ray binaries is known to occur  with different physical properties  in two spectral states : the `` low / hard '' state ( lhs ) and the `` very - high '' state ( vhs ) ( fender et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the lhs is characterised by a steady jet , with moderately low bulk lorentz factor ( @xmath37 : fender et al .",
    "2004 ; gallo , fender & pooley 2003 ) . in a steady state",
    ", there is a `` fundamental - plane '' correlation between radio luminosity , x - ray luminosity and bh mass ( falcke , krding & markoff 2004 ; see also merloni , heinz & dimatteo 2003 ; fender et al .",
    "2004 ) , of the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 ( markoff et al .",
    "2003 ) . taking this relation at face value  or , equivalently , using the empirical relation @xmath40 ( merloni et al .",
    "2003)we would infer a bh mass @xmath41 , well in excess of any estimates of other ulx masses , including the strong intermediate - mass bh candidate in m82 ( strohmayer & mushotzky 2003 ; fiorito & titarchuk 2004 ) .    however , there are at least two reasons why we rule out this result as unphysical .",
    "firstly , the observed radio spectral index ( @xmath42 ) is too steep to be consistent with an lhs steady jet , which is typically optically thick ( core - dominated ) , with flat or slightly inverted radio spectrum ( fender et al .",
    "secondly , the x - ray spectrum ( soria et al .  2004 ) is itself inconsistent with an lhs .",
    "the x - ray spectrum in a lhs is dominated by a power - law of spectral index @xmath43 ( i.e. , photon index @xmath44 as more commonly defined in x - ray literature ) . instead",
    ", the observed x - ray spectrum of x-1 is much steeper ( softer ) , with @xmath45 ( i.e. , @xmath18 ) .",
    "we conclude that the radio emission is not consistent with a steady jet from an accreting bh in the lhs .",
    "the x - ray spectrum ( soria et al .  2004 ) is consistent with the classical vhs of galactic x - ray binaries , also called the `` steep power - law '' state , using the revised state classification of mcclintock & remillard ( 2003 ) . steady jets with a flat or inverted radio spectrum are sometimes observed in the `` hard '' sub - division of the vhs : this can be considered a high - luminosity extension of the lhs discussed ( and ruled out ) in section 3.1 .",
    "stronger radio flares are observed in galactic sources at the transition between the `` hard '' and `` soft '' subdivisions , as the sources become softer and cross the `` jet line '' ( see figure 7 of fender et al .",
    "these flares are interpreted as discrete relativistic radio ejections , with a higher bulk lorentz factor than in an lhs jet ( @xmath46 a few : gallo et al .",
    "one explanation for the steep - spectrum radio emission is optically - thin synchrotron , from internal shocks in the jet , consequence of the sudden increase in the lorentz factor during the state transition ( fender et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "well - known examples of galactic bh binaries with a radio flaring behaviour in their vhs include grs 1915@xmath47105 , gro j1655@xmath2040 , and xte j1550@xmath20564 ( table 1 ) .",
    "if moved to the distance of ngc5408 , even at their peaks they would appear two to three orders of magnitude fainter than the radio counterpart of x-1 .",
    "moreover , the radio to x - ray flux ratio is at least an order of magnitude higher in x-1 , compared to those galactic sources ( figure 5 ) .",
    "again , one might suggest that the enhanced radio luminosity , and radio - to - x - ray flux ratio are due to a much higher bh mass in x-1 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     however , even if x-1 is interpreted ( based on its x - ray properties ) as a bh binary in the vhs , quantitative comparisons with radio - flaring galactic bhs are highly problematic .",
    "the vhs is a short - lived transient state , and a major ejection is a brief ( rise time @xmath48 day ) , sporadic event ( once every few months or years ) , as the source undergoes a hard to soft transition , associated with a change in the accretion disk inner radius . in our case ,",
    "the radio flux was the same on the two occasions in which the source was observed , almost five years apart . catching x-1 during a major flare",
    "once would be a remarkable coincidence ; observing it twice in exactly the same state would be too unlikely .",
    "moreover , there is no evidence of any x - ray spectral state transitions over a series of _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations spanning the years 20012004 . hence , it is more likely that the observed radio emission is a persistent feature of this source .",
    "the only marginally viable alternative is that the source is persistently in the vhs , oscillating in a `` dip - flare '' cycle like grs 1915@xmath47105 , crossing the jet line back and forth in the process ( fender et al .",
    "1999 ; fender & belloni 2004 and references therein ) ; this state is characterized by moderate x - ray and radio flaring on timescales of a few hundred seconds .",
    "repeated flaring on similar timescales is indeed observed in the power - law component of the x - ray spectrum of x-1 ( soria et al .",
    "finding the source in that same dip - flare cycle in 2000 and 2004 ( and in a similar x - ray spectral state consistent with the vhs in all observations between those two epochs ) could perhaps suggest that this ulx has a different spectral - state behaviour than classical galactic x - ray binaries .",
    "the peak radio flux density of grs 1915@xmath47105 in the oscillatory state is three orders of magnitude lower than the radio flux of x-1 , scaled to the same distance ( table 1 ) .",
    "taken at face value , the intensity of the radio emission from x-1 in 2000 and 2004 make this ulx very peculiar , in comparison with typical galactic bh x - ray binary , in which the radio emission is believed to come from a compact jet ( figure 5 ) .",
    "however , we must also consider the possibility that the radio source associated to x-1 is enhanced by doppler boosting , as we shall discuss in section 3.3 .",
    "relativistic doppler boosting is a possible mechanism to reconcile the brightness of x-1 with those of galactic bhs , as originally suggested by kaaret et al .",
    "the amplification of the rest - frame emission due to doppler boosting @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 depending on whether it is a continuous jet or sporadic ejections .",
    "having already ruled out ( section 3.2 ) both a steady jet in the lhs and a single major flare , we only need to estimate the doppler boosting required for a persistent dip - flare cycle . in grs 1915@xmath47105 , the lorentz factor @xmath52 in this state is @xmath53 and perhaps as high as @xmath54 ( fender et al .  2004 ) ; at a viewing angle @xmath55 , the observed @xmath54-ghz flux is @xmath56 mjy at 11 kpc , corresponding to @xmath57 @xmath58jy at 4.8 mpc . to enhance this value by a factor @xmath59 , a viewing angle @xmath60 ( for @xmath61 ) or @xmath62 ( for @xmath63 ) is required , for a source identical to grs 1915@xmath47105 and @xmath64 . allowing for an intrinsic radio luminosity an order of magnitude stronger than in grs 1915@xmath47105 ( justified by the fact that the apparent x - ray luminosity is also a factor of 10 higher ) , only @xmath65 ( for @xmath61 ) or @xmath66 ( for @xmath63 )",
    "are required . as an aside",
    ", we note that in order to allow for persistent dip - flare ejections with lorentz factors @xmath67 , the microquasar would have to reside in a large low - density bubble , otherwise the jet - ism interaction would rapidly reduce the jet speed .    for the x - ray emission , strong beaming",
    "is disfavoured by the presence of a soft , non - variable thermal component at @xmath68 kev , with unabsorbed luminosity @xmath69 erg s@xmath1 in the @xmath14@xmath70 kev band ( soria et al .",
    "it is still unclear whether this soft component , typical of many ulxs ( miller , fabian & miller  2004 ; feng & kaaret 2005 ) , comes from the accretion disk or from a downscattering corona or outflow ( e.g. , laming & titarchuk 2004 ; king & pounds 2003 ) , or perhaps from a combination of reflection and absorption ( chevallier et al .",
    "2006 ; crummy et al .",
    "2006 ) ; but in any case , it is difficult to reconcile with relativistically beamed emission . thus , it is more likely that at least the soft component of the x - ray emission is isotropic , requiring a bh with a mass @xmath16 to satisfy the eddington limit .",
    "it is possible , instead , that the power - law component is beamed , for example produced by inverse - compton scattering of disk photons by the jet ( e.g. , bosch - ramon , romero & paredes 2005 ; georganopoulos et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "we conclude that doppler boosting by a relativistic jet can in principle explain the observed radio flux and is not inconsistent with the x - ray properties .",
    "however , we consider this scenario somewhat contrived because it relies on the source spending most of its time in a `` persistent '' vhs with steep - spectrum dip - flare oscillations over many years .",
    "this is unlike the typical spectral state behaviour of galactic x - ray binaries and microquasars ; no other sources with the same behaviour have been found yet .",
    "the other difficulty is that we have at least speculative evidence to believe that the radio source is extended over @xmath71 pc ( section 2 ) , which would rule out point - like core emission .      in all the scenarios discussed  and in most cases ruled out  so far , the radio emission would be coming from the innermost region around the bh , and would be directly related to its current state of accretion .",
    "we shall now consider the possibility that the emission comes , instead , from a larger region in the interstellar medium around the bh .",
    "the association with free - free radio emission from a star - forming region was already ruled out ( kaaret et al .",
    "2003 ) due to the observed steep spectrum , inconsistent with thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "a steep optically - thin synchrotron spectrum would instead be consistent with an underlying shell - like snr : remnants in this class have typical radio spectral indices @xmath72 .",
    "on the other hand , we can rule out filled - center ( plerionic , or pulsar - wind - nebula ) snrs  such as the crab  because their spectral indices are much flatter ( @xmath73 ; e.g. , weiler & panagia 1978 ) .",
    "our observed index @xmath42 would be among the steepest , but not unique .",
    "for example , at least three , and possibly five of the 14 shell - like snr candidates in ngc300 have a spectral index @xmath74 ( pannuti et al .",
    "2000 ) ; three of the 15 shell - like snr candidates in ngc6946 have an index between @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( hyman et al .",
    "2000 ) ; two of the 53 snrs in m33 ( including both plerion and shell - like snrs ) have an index @xmath77 ( duric et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the radio flux of our source in ngc5408 ( @xmath3 mjy at 4.8 ghz ) would also be among the highest for snrs in nearby galaxies , but not unique .",
    "the brightest radio snrs in ngc300 would only reach a flux density @xmath78 mjy at the distance of ngc5408 .",
    "however , 6 of the 15 radio snr candidates in ngc6946 would have a 5 ghz flux @xmath79 mjy ( hyman et al .",
    "2000 ) ; the brightest snr in that galaxy would have a flux @xmath80 mjy .",
    "all five of the candidate snrs in ngc4258 ( hyman et al .",
    "2001 ) are also brighter , with fluxes @xmath81@xmath82 mjy at the distance of x-1 . in ngc7793 , four of the five brightest radio snrs would have fluxes @xmath83@xmath84 mjy at the distance of ngc5408 ( pannuti et al .",
    "2002 ) ; however , the brightest candidate snr in that galaxy , ngc7793-s26 , has a spectral index @xmath85 and would have a 5 ghz flux @xmath81 mjy .",
    "the brightest shell - like snr in our galaxy , cas a , would be seen with a 5 ghz flux of @xmath57 mjy ( reynoso & goss 2002 ) and a diameter of @xmath86 .",
    "one explanation for such exceptionally bright snrs is that they are produced by very massive stars with strong winds ; hence , the explosion occurred in a dense circumstellar environment ( dunne , gruendl & chu 2000 ) .",
    "alternatively , the remnants may be the result of multiple sn explosions , perhaps inside a star cluster ( pannuti et al .",
    "either scenario would be consistent with a direct physical association between the snr and the process of formation of the ulx x-1 .",
    "in addition , a relatively young age may play a role . in summary ,",
    "a bright shell - like snr would be consistent with the measured fluxes and spectral index , would explain why the flux has been approximately the same between 2000 and 2004 , and would be a natural candidate for the formation of the ulx .",
    "if , as we speculate , the radio source in ngc5408 is marginally resolved with a diameter @xmath87@xmath88 pc , we can apply the purely empirical correlation between age and diameter , found in galactic snrs ( xu , zhang & han 2005 ) : we obtain an age @xmath89 yr , with a best - fit age @xmath7 yr ( but with a large scatter ) .",
    "thus , the source would be too large to be a very young or historical snr ( like cas a ) . in sections 3.5 and 3.6",
    "we shall try to find more stringent tests to the snr scenario , based on the minimum - energy condition , and suggest an alternative explanation .",
    "the snr scenario was initially rejected ( kaaret et al .",
    "2003 ) because there appeared to be no evidence of optical emission lines at the x-1 position ( upper limit of @xmath91 erg s@xmath1 @xmath92 derived for h@xmath90 by kaaret et al .",
    "2003 , from a broad - band _ hst_/wfpc2 image in the f606w filter ) .",
    "although the ulx appears to be well separated from the starburst region , in broad - band optical images ( e.g. , the @xmath93-band _ subaru _ image in figure 6 , top panel ; and the _ hst_/wfpc2 image in kaaret et al .",
    "2003 ) , a narrow - band h@xmath90 image ( figure 6 , bottom panel ) shows instead that most of the galaxy is filled by a tangled web of h filaments and knots . for this study , we downloaded and analysed public - archive h@xmath90 and r - continuum images taken from the eso 3.6 m telescope ( efosc camera ) by m. pakull and l. mirioni .",
    "in particular , an h@xmath90-emitting knot is visible at the ulx position ( figure 7 ) ( as noted in mirioni 2003 , pakull & mirioni 2003 ) : it has a slightly elongated shape , with a size of @xmath35 pc , matching the upper limit ( and possibly the true size ) of the radio - emitting blob .",
    "we checked that the slight displacement between the h@xmath90 knot and the radio and x - ray positions is within the error in the astrometry of the optical image ( @xmath94 ) ; therefore , the h@xmath90 , radio and x - ray emission are consistent with being coincident .",
    "the h@xmath90 knot is connected to the main starburst region through a network of filaments and cavities ( figure 7 ) .",
    "we estimate a flux @xmath95 erg @xmath92 s@xmath1 from that knot , corresponding to a luminosity @xmath96 erg s@xmath1 in the line ( or @xmath97 h@xmath90 photons s@xmath1 ) , that is @xmath98 times the total h@xmath90 emission from ngc5408 .",
    "the peak surface brightness @xmath99 erg @xmath92 s@xmath1 arcsec@xmath100 .    if the h@xmath90 line emission is due to recombination , its estimated luminosity requires a flux of @xmath101@xmath102 ionizing photons s@xmath1 intercepted by the nebula ( osterbrok 1989 ; cf .",
    "also similar calculations for other photo - ionized nebulae in pakull & angebault 1986 , and soria et al .",
    "this is a relatively modest requirement .",
    "subaru _ and _ hst _ images show three massive stars near the peak of the radio and h@xmath90 emission , with absolute @xmath93 magnitudes @xmath103 and bluish colors , @xmath104 ( kaaret et al .",
    "2003 ; copperwheat et al .",
    "2006 , in prep . ) .",
    "they are consistent with main - sequence o stars , or , more likely , blue supergiants .",
    "three such stars with initial masses @xmath105 would provide enough ionizing photons to explain the h@xmath90 emission ( sternberg , hoffmann & pauldrach 2003 ; schaerer & de koter 1997 ) . as a consistency check , the size of a strmgren sphere at a characteristic temperature @xmath106 k is @xmath107 pc , where @xmath108 is the photo - ionizing flux in units of @xmath109 photons s@xmath1 and @xmath110 is the hydrogen number density in units of @xmath70 @xmath111 .",
    "this is in agreement with the observed size of the h region at the ulx position times fainter than the non - thermal emission measured at the ulx position ( dickel , harten & gull 1983 ; lazendic , dickel & jones 2003 ) .",
    "hence , the thermal contribution is absolutely negligible in our case , and does not affect our estimate of the radio spectral index . ] .",
    "we stress that this h@xmath90 nebula is not at all unique or remarkable for this galaxy , and is fainter than many other knots and filaments ( figure 6 ) , which are probably due to ob photo - ionization or local density enhancements in the outflowing warm gas .",
    "it is only its association with strong x - ray and synchrotron radio emission that makes it remarkable .",
    "hence , we also need to consider the possibility that the local enhancement in the h@xmath90 emission is directly caused by the ulx .",
    "we used xspec to re - analyze the _ xmm - newton _ x - ray spectra of the ulx from 20012003 ( soria et al .",
    "2004 ) , using variable - abundance , ionized absorbers in addition to the galactic line - of - sight term .",
    "we found that intrinsic absorption ( column density @xmath112 @xmath92 ) removes @xmath113 photons s@xmath1 with energies above @xmath114 ev , assuming a thermal comptonization model ( bmc ) for the x - ray spectrum .",
    "plausible local interstellar gas densities @xmath115 a few @xmath111 are consistent with a significant fraction of the intrinsic absorption coming from @xmath116 pc from the ulx . hence ,",
    "photoionization from the ulx may contribute a similar amount of h - ionizing photons as the few ob stars in the surrounding region .",
    "finally , part of the h@xmath90 emission may be due to shock - ionization from an snr .",
    "most identified radio snrs in nearby galaxies are associated with much brighter h@xmath90 emission , from @xmath117 a few @xmath118 erg s@xmath1 @xmath92 up to @xmath117 a few @xmath119 erg s@xmath1 @xmath92 at the distance of x-1 ( hyman et al .",
    "2000 ; pannuti et al .",
    "2000 ; deharveng et al .",
    "this is partly due to a selection bias ( e.g. , pannuti et al .",
    "2000 ) : unresolved , non - thermal ( steep - spectrum ) radio sources without optical line emission would generally be discarded as background agn . however , radio synchrotron and h@xmath90 emission in snrs come from different processes , and are not strongly correlated ; in fact , there are a few radio - bright candidate snr in nearby galaxies , with h@xmath90 emission below the level inferred for the source in ngc5408 : for example , some sources in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) ( figure 1a in filipovic et al .  1998 ) .",
    "flux and 4.8 ghz radio flux density from the source in ngc5408 would be @xmath120 erg @xmath92 s@xmath1 and @xmath121 jy , respectively , translated to the distance of the large magellanic cloud . ] other examples of h@xmath90-faint snrs are found in ngc300 ( table 4 in payne et al .",
    "2004 ) . in summary",
    ", we conclude that the snr scenario for the radio synchrotron emission remains viable , although probably not the most likely .",
    "we shall also see in section 3.6 that the radio source would require an explosion energy unusually high for a normal sn . in the optical band ,",
    "more narrow - band imaging and spectral studies are needed to distinguish between the main competing scenarios ( h region , x - ray ionized nebula , shock - ionized snr ) .",
    "specifically , the most important constraints will come from the presence or absence of nebular [ o ] and he emission , and from the [ s]/h@xmath90 and [ o]/h@xmath90 line ratios .",
    "finally , we consider the possibility that the optically - thin synchrotron radio emission comes from extended radio lobes associated with the ulx .",
    "while core emission from a radio jet ( sections 3.13.3 ) traces the instantaneous accretion power and spectral state of the bh , emission from radio lobes depends on the accretion activity integrated over the source lifetime ( e.g. , scheuer 1974 ) , even if the core were not currently active .",
    "hence , we do no expect significant variability over a few years , in agreement with the observations .",
    "almost all radio - loud agn show a lobe structure , which dominates the radio emission in frii sources . on the other hand , while most x - ray binaries are thought to release part of their accretion power in a jet , only a few sources have been found so far with persistent lobe - like emission : cyg x-1 ( gallo et al 2005 ) ; cir x-1 ( tudose et al .",
    "2006 ) ; the galactic microquasars 1e 1740.7@xmath202942 and grs 1758@xmath20258 ( mirabel et al .",
    "1992 ; hardcastle 2005 ) .",
    "in addition , in ss433 , a radio - lobe structure may coexist with an underlying snr ( downes , pauls & salter 1996 ; dubner et al .",
    "1998 ) ; it has been noted that ss433 may be classified as a ulx if we could see it face - on ( fabrika & mescheryakov 2001 ) .",
    "the size of the steep - spectrum radio - lobe structure in ss433 is @xmath122 pc , very similar to the source in ngc5408 ; however , the radio luminosity density is an order of magnitude lower .",
    "the main difference between radio galaxy and microquasar lobes is due to the environment : while some quantities , such as all characteristic time - scales , length - scales and energies , scale as @xmath123 , others , such as the density of the ambient medium , do not ( e.g. , heinz 2002 ) .",
    "in particular , radio lobes in stellar - mass microquasars tend to be much more over - pressured with respect to the external medium ; therefore , they have a shorter lifetime due to adiabatic expansion ( hardcastle 2005 ; hardcastle & worrall 2000 ) .",
    "nonetheless , pakull & mirioni ( 2002 ) discovered that many ulxs are indeed surrounded by large optical nebulae possibly powered by the interaction of a jet with the interstellar medium .",
    "the spectral index and total radio power alone do not give us enough information to determine the physical parameters of the lobes  in particular , the energy density of the particles and the magnetic field .",
    "however , if the size of the lobes ( hence , their surface brightness ) is known , one can minimize the total energy density to get a rough constraint on the particle and field energy and pressure ( e.g. , pacholczyk 1970 ) . in our case , the radio source may be marginally resolved ( section 2 ) , although its detailed spatial geometry is unknown . for simplicity",
    ", we take a spherical lobe with a radius of @xmath124 pc ( @xmath125 ) , a power - law distribution of relativistic electrons with spectral index @xmath126 ( corresponding to @xmath127 ) , and we assume that the electron distribution extends between lorentz factors of @xmath70 and @xmath128   mgauss , the synchrotron cooling timescale of relativistic electrons is @xmath129 yr , where @xmath52 is the lorentz factor . taking instead an upper limit @xmath130 for the electron distribution does not significantly affect our results : for our rather steep spectral index @xmath2 , the minimum energy depends more strongly on the low - energy cut - off of the electron distribution .",
    "for example , a lower cut - off at @xmath131 would reduce the estimated energies by a factor of 3 . ] .",
    "we also assume a magnetic field randomly distributed with respect to the line of sight , and a volume filling factor @xmath132 .",
    "see appendix a for a brief summary of the formulae we used to estimate the minimum - energy magnetic field .",
    "the matter content of a quasar or microquasar jet is still a hotly debated issue ( romero 2005 ) .",
    "for example , the galactic microquasar ls 5039 has been variously modelled with leptonic ( bosch - ramon et al .",
    "2005 ; dermer & bttcher 2006 ) or hadronic jets ( romero et al .  2003 ;",
    "aharonian et al .",
    "an electron - positron plasma was suggested for the jet in nova muscae ( grs1124@xmath20684 ) ( kaiser & hannikainen 2002 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a significant hadronic contribution could explain why synchrotron emission is not detected within the free - free emitting bubble of cyg x-1 ( gallo et a.  2005 ) .",
    "hadronic jet models are also favoured for the microquasars ss 433 ( migliari , fender & mendez 2002 ) , and ls i@xmath4761303 ( romero , christiansen & orellana 2005 ) .",
    "a leptonic model was instead suggested for the powerful quasar 3c 279 ( wardle et al .",
    "1998 ) , based on the detection of circular polarization .    from the observed 4.8 ghz flux , for an electron - positron plasma",
    ", we obtain : a minimum energy density @xmath133 erg @xmath111 for a random magnetic field @xmath134 mgauss , the minimum - energy condition also implies energy equipartition , while for a spectral index @xmath135 the energy density of the magnetic field would be @xmath136 of the particle energy density . ] ; a minimum pressure @xmath137 dynes @xmath92 ; and a total energy @xmath138 erg .",
    "alternatively , taking two lobes with radii of @xmath139 pc @xmath140 , the minimum pressure is @xmath141 dynes @xmath92 and the total energy is @xmath142 erg .",
    "most quantities depend strongly on the adopted value of @xmath31 .",
    "taking @xmath143 as a strong upper limit , we infer a total energy @xmath144 erg for a single @xmath124-pc electron - positron bubble , or @xmath145 erg for two @xmath139-pc lobes .",
    "if energy and pressure in the synchrotron - emitting bubble are dominated by relativistic protons , the total energy can be up to a factor of 10 higher than in the leptonic case , for the same sets of parameters .",
    "for example , if hadrons carry @xmath146 of the energy , the minimum - energy condition implies a magnetic field @xmath147 mgauss and a total energy @xmath148 erg for a @xmath124-pc synchrotron bubble with a spectral index @xmath149 ; our limit @xmath150 implies an energy @xmath151 erg .",
    "hence , the leptonic - jet assumption can be used as a conservative lower limit to the energy in the bubble .    on the other hand , relativistic hadrons",
    "do carry most of the energy in snrs ( known sources of cosmic rays ) .",
    "therefore , if the radio source in ngc5408 is interpreted as an snr , we need to use the higher range of energy estimates .",
    "energies @xmath152 erg are implausibly high for a single `` standard '' sn . following this argument leads us to conclude that a snr interpretation is less likely than a radio lobe scenario , but we can not rule out the possibility of a more energetic hypernova remnant .",
    "conversely , we could assume that the source is an snr with a standard energy @xmath153 erg , and infer its size from the minimum - energy condition .",
    "it turns out that the remnant should be @xmath154@xmath155 pc in radius , for the observed flux and spectral index .",
    "hence , deeper high - frequency radio observations will be crucial to unequivocally determine the size of the radio source ( or at least a more stringent upper limit ) and test the snr scenario .",
    "one might suggest that the injection spectral index was flatter ( @xmath156 ) , and the steeper index currently observed at high frequencies may simply be due to an ageing population of relativistic electrons inside the expanding bubble ( `` spectral ageing '' ) , as the higher - energy electron population is depleted by synchrotron losses .",
    "if this is the case , the total energy in a @xmath124-pc bubble would be lower , @xmath157 erg ( corresponding to a magnetic field @xmath158 mgauss ) , consistent with a normal sn .",
    "the presence of a spectral break in the radio continuum would , in principle , provide another criterion to distinguish between an snr and a jet - inflated lobe .",
    "for an snr , we expect an exponential cut - off in the spectrum above the break frequency @xmath159 ( jaffe & perola 1973 ) ; for a jet bubble , characterized by continuous injection , the spectrum would be a broken power law with an index @xmath160 above the break frequency ( kardashev 1962 ) .",
    "the problem with the spectral break scenario is that a relatively old age is required for the break to occur at frequencies as low as @xmath161@xmath162 ghz .",
    "following murgia ( 2003 ) , and using the previous order - of - magnitude estimate of the magnetic field , we obtain a characteristic age @xmath163 yr for an expanding @xmath124-pc bubble .",
    "snrs of that age are unlikely to be still so bright .",
    "this age is also longer than the characteristic age we shall estimate for the radio - lobe scenario ( section 4 ) .",
    "however , even in this case we can not entirely rule the break scenario , for example if @xmath93 is well above equipartition in a magnetically dominated outflow .",
    "in section 3.6 we have treated the size of the bubble simply as an arbitrary input parameter .",
    "we can learn more about the time evolution of a jet - inflated bubble if we express its radius self - consistently as a function of the total energy injected into it , thus coupling a radial expansion equation with the energy density equation .",
    "to do so , we describe the supersonic ( but sub - relativistic ) expansion and radio emission from the bubble with a set of self - similar solutions ( castor , mccray & weaver  1975 ; falle 1991 ) , often adopted to model radio lobes in agn and galactic micro - quasars ( heinz , reynolds & begelman 1998 ; willott et al .",

    ", we use a density @xmath167 , valid for a pure hydrogen gas ; in any case , the main results from the self - similar solutions do not have a strong dependence on the mean atomic weight .",
    "the self - similar equations governing the expansion of the bubble are ( e.g. , heinz et al .  1998 ) : @xmath168 @xmath169 where @xmath170 is the total energy injected by the jet into the radio cocoon , and @xmath171 is the time - averaged jet power , assuming that it is either approximately constant , or with a duty cycle much shorter than the time @xmath172 . the emitted flux density at a frequency @xmath173 is then @xmath174 see appendix b for an outline of the derivation of eq.(5 ) .",
    "we followed willott et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to obtain the normalization of the relations between jet power and age and radio flux of the cocoon ( equations 3 and 5 ) , definitely ruled out in our case . ] .",
    "the normalization factors are based on the estimated ages , ambient gas densities and @xmath175-mhz flux densities for the frii radio galaxies in the 7c redshift survey .",
    "they also depend on the adopted value of a scaling factor @xmath176 ( as defined in willott et al .",
    "1999 ) for the total energy inside the cocoon , inferred from the minimum - energy condition .",
    "the factor @xmath176 parameterizes our ignorance of the exact geometry of the cocoon , low - energy cut - off in the electron distribution , filling factor , deviations from equipartition , and proton contribution .",
    "the assumptions we adopted in section 3.6 to estimate the total energy correspond to a choice of @xmath177 , which is a plausible number for qso radio lobes ; it was estimated in blundell & rawlings ( 2000 ) that @xmath176 is most likely to vary between @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "therefore , our normalization coincides with the one adopted by punsly ( 2005 ) , that is @xmath180 erg s@xmath1 for @xmath181 erg s@xmath1 hz@xmath1 sr@xmath1 .",
    "this choice of normalization may easily vary by a factor of 2 at the reference flux , and larger uncertainties may be introduced as we scale the solution from the parameter range suitable for radio - loud qsos ( e.g. , @xmath182 @xmath111 , @xmath183 yr , @xmath184 erg s@xmath1 ) , to the range suitable for microquasars ( e.g. , @xmath185 @xmath111 , @xmath186 yr , @xmath187 erg s@xmath1 ) .",
    "another caveat is that sources with a radio spectral index @xmath2 are outliers in the frii sample : most have indices between @xmath188 and @xmath189 ( e.g. , figure 5 in willott et al .",
    "1999 ) . inserting the observed flux ( @xmath190 mjy at @xmath191 ghz ) and speculative size ( @xmath192 pc ) of the radio - emitting bubble into equations ( 35 ) , for an electron - positron plasma",

    "we recall that we estimated ( section 3.6 ) a total pressure @xmath197 dynes @xmath92 inside the lobes ; this is much larger than the thermal pressure of the undisturbed ism , which is @xmath198 dynes @xmath92 , with a sound speed @xmath199 km s@xmath1 for @xmath106 k. the expansion of the bubble into the ism is supersonic , with mach number @xmath200 .",
    "hence , we expect the expanding cocoon to drive a strong shock into the ism",
    ". pressure balance should occur between the pressure inside the cocoon ( @xmath201 ) and the thermal plus ram pressure of the shocked ambient gas , swept up in a shell outside the cocoon .",
    "applying standard rankine - hugoniot conditions ( e.g. , spitzer  1978 ) , we expect a thermal pressure in the shocked gas @xmath202 dynes @xmath92 , a density of the shocked gas @xmath203 times the ambient ism density , and a ram pressure @xmath204 dynes @xmath92 .",
    "thus , even though our simple spherical model is only a crude approximation of a real radio lobe , we obtain that the total pressure inside the cocoon is balanced by the thermal plus ram pressure of the swept - up interstellar medium , as we should expect .",

    "the total energies and pressure inside the bubble are an order of magnitude higher than in the leptonic case ( @xmath209 ) .",
    "the internal pressure is still roughly balanced by ram plus thermal pressure in the shocked gas ( @xmath210 ) .",
    "finally , from the rankine - hugoniot equations we also predict a temperature in the swept - out shell @xmath154 times the ambient ism temperature , i.e. @xmath7 k. the shell thickness should be @xmath211 pc .",
    "we infer a cooling timescale for the shocked gas @xmath212 yr , that is , longer than the estimated lifetime of the radio cocoon .",
    "this may explain why we do not see stronger balmer line emission from that region .",
    "the total synchrotron energy radiated over the lifetime of the bubble is also negligible ( @xmath213 ) compared with the injected energy @xmath214 ( willott et al .",
    "this explains why the value of @xmath170 in equation ( 4 ) can be treated as the total energy inside the bubble at present time .",
    "considering the various sources of uncertainty mentioned earlier , the scenario outlined in this section can only represent one possible solution in agreement with the ( few ) observed parameters .",
    "nonetheless , it is a plausible scenario , consistent with existing models for microquasars . as already mentioned in section 3.1 , a steady radio jet is thought to dominate the power output in the lhs , and a transient jet may be present in the vhs , while it is suppressed in the hs . in the conventional definition of lhs , the x - ray luminosity @xmath215 , and the jet power @xmath216 , with @xmath217 ( fender , gallo & jonker 2003 ; fender et al .",

    "the holmberg ii radio source is resolved ( size @xmath56 pc ) and has a flux density @xmath248 mjy at 5 ghz ( miller et al .",
    "2005 ) , corresponding to @xmath57 mjy at the distance of ngc5408 ; hence , the two sources may be very similar ( the x - ray luminosity and spectral properties of the corresponding ulxs are also similar : dewangan et al .",
    "2004 ; soria et al .",
    "2004 ) . in that case",
    ", the pure snr scenario appears inconsistent with the optical line spectrum ; the most likely interpretation is that the synchrotron bubble is powered by the ulx jet ( miller et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "finally , should we expect to find many more microquasar lobes in nearby galaxies , perhaps misidentified as snr ?",
    "taking ngc5408 and holmberg ii as typical cases , such lobes would require a jet injection power @xmath249 erg s@xmath1 over @xmath250 yr , in order to be detected by existing radio surveys of nearby galaxies .",
    "if we assume that the jet power @xmath251 , such systems should be associated with potential ulxs . in some cases ,",
    "the x - ray source may not be currently active ( or active at ulx level ) , yet there would still be a bright synchrotron radio source , formed by the integrated source activity over its lifetime .",
    "therefore , finding the number ratio between microquasar lobes with or without a currently active ulx core could in principle provide a constraint on the average duty cycle of ulx microquasars . as an example , two bright radio sources , consistent with synchrotron bubbles with minimum - energies @xmath252 erg ( hence , candidate microquasar lobes or hypernovae ) have recently been discovered in ngc7424 ( soria et al .",
    "one is associated with a transient ulx , the other has no corresponding x - ray source , down to a completeness limit @xmath253 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "thus , one could speculate that the ulx responsible for latter radio source is currently in the off state .",
    "further discussion of these issues is beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "two alternative formulations are used in the literature to estimate the minimum energy associated with a radio source ( e.g. , tudose et al .",
    "one choice ( e.g. , pohl 1993 , bicknell 2005 ) , arguably the more physical , is to assume an energy range @xmath254 for the relativistic electrons . in this framework , following bicknell ( 2005 ) , a useful way of expressing the minimum - energy magnetic field is : @xmath255^{2/(p+5 ) }       \\nonumber\\\\      & \\times &      \\left[h(p,\\gamma_{\\rm min } , \\gamma_{\\rm max})\\ ,        \\frac{i_{\\nu } \\nu^{-\\alpha_{\\rm r}}}{2r_{\\rm c}}\\right]^{2/(p+5 ) }      \\nonumber\\\\      & \\approx & 5.687 \\times 10 ^ 8 \\times ( 3.291 \\times 10^{37})^{2/(p+5 ) }       \\nonumber\\\\      & \\times & \\left [ \\frac{p+1}{2 } \\ , ( 1+k ) \\",
    ",      c_1^{-1}(p)\\,h(p,\\gamma_{\\rm min } , \\gamma_{\\rm max } ) \\right]^{2/(p+5 ) }       \\nonumber\\\\      & \\times & \\left[\\left(\\frac{i_{\\nu}/2r_{\\rm c}}{{\\rm erg~s}^{-1 }      { \\rm~cm}^{-3}{\\rm~hz}^{-1}{\\rm~sr}^{-1}}\\right ) \\ ,      \\nu^{-\\alpha_{\\rm r}}\\right ]      ^{2/(p+5 ) } \\nonumber\\\\      & & \\ \\ { \\rm gauss},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the energy spectrum of the electrons is @xmath256 , @xmath257 , @xmath258 and @xmath259 are the electron mass and charge , @xmath260 the speed of light , @xmath261 the specific surface brightness ( flux per angular beam area ) , @xmath262 is the characteristic source diameter , and @xmath263 is the ratio between the energy of protons and electrons . we have assumed a filling factor of 1 , for simplicity .",
    "the functions @xmath264,\\ ] ] @xmath265 and @xmath266 is the gamma function .",
    "the corresponding total ( minimum ) energy density is ( bicknell 2005 ) : @xmath267 in our analysis , we adopted @xmath268 , @xmath269 . for a steep spectrum",
    ", the minimum energy depends only very weakly on the high - energy cut - off . as for the low - energy cut - off , there are theoretical arguments and observational evidence for the presence of low - energy electrons in a radio lobe ( e.g. , blundell & rawlings 2000 , their section 11.1 ) .",
    "the alternative choice ( e.g. , burbidge 1956 ; pacholczyk 1970 ; longair 1994 ; willott et al .",
    "1999 ) is to assume a frequency range @xmath270 of the radio emission . in that case , the magnetic field for which the energy density is minimized is ( longair 1994 ) : @xmath271 where @xmath272 is the volume of the bubble , and we have assumed a unit filling factor . the functions @xmath273 \\,\\nu^{(p-1)/2}}{a(p ) ( p-2 ) } ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath274 and @xmath266 is again the gamma function .",
    "the minimum energy density is then ( e.g. , tudose et al .",
    "2006 ) : @xmath275    the physical connection between the two formalisms is that for an electron of energy @xmath52 , the peak of its synchrotron emission is at a frequency @xmath276 in some cases ( e.g. , willott et al .  1999 ; punsly 2005 ) , the minimum - energy quantities are estimated for a conventional lower cut - off at @xmath277 mhz ( lowest frequency accessible to earth - based radio observations ) , and then the energy density is corrected by a numerical factor @xmath278 to account for low - energy electrons emitting below 10 mhz , and for hadronic contributions . in our case , setting a low - frequency limit of 10 mhz would imply an implausibly high @xmath279 for a leptonic plasma . empirically , it was shown ( blundell & rawlings 2000 ; punsly 2005 ) that the energy in the lobes of radio galaxies is @xmath154@xmath179 times the minimum - energy estimated from a leptonic plasma with a 10-mhz cut - off . for a radio spectral index @xmath2 , our choice of a leptonic plasma with @xmath280 , @xmath281 corresponds to a correction factor @xmath282 , consistent with the observations ( see also section 4 )",
    "we outline here the derivation of equation ( 5 ) from equations ( 3,4 ) and the minimum - energy condition . adopting falle ( 1991 ) s self - similar solution , the radius @xmath164 of an expanding cocoon scales as @xmath283 where the density @xmath284 . for a constant ism density ( @xmath285 ) , eq.(b1 )",
    "reduces to eq.(3 ) .",
    "the bubble size is also related to the total energy @xmath286 , and from eq.(4 ) : @xmath287 in the minimum - energy approximation , @xmath288 .",
    "hence , from equations ( a1,a5 ) , @xmath289^{4/(p+5)}\\ ] ] with simple algebraic manipulations , the system of equations ( b1,b2,b3 ) can be solved as : @xmath290 which is identical to eq.(5 ) for @xmath285 and @xmath291 . similarly to heinz ( 2002 ) ( who discussed the case @xmath292 ) , the normalization coefficient in front of eq.(b4 ) was fixed to be consistent with willott et al .  ( 1999 ) s study of radio lobe properties in radio galaxies ( section 4 ) ."
