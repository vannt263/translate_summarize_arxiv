    "the recent technological advancement in the conformal bootstrap program has made it an indispensable tool in the non - perturbative study of higher - dimensional ( @xmath3 ) conformal field theories ( cfts ) .",
    "the central idea is to examine the constraints on correlation functions from their basic requirements such as unitarity and crossing symmetry @xcite@xcite , which has been put into practical use recently @xcite . by truncating the problem to a finite convex - optimization one",
    ", they succeeded in deriving a rigorous bound on the conformal dimensions of certain operators without assuming the explicit form of the hamiltonian ( or lagrangian ) . soon after , the technique has been generalized to constrain other parameters in cfts such as operator product expansion coefficients @xcite and central charges @xcite@xcite .    while these constraints are non - trivial and their complete generality is a significant achievement , what is astonishing is that a certain class of interacting cfts , whose existence is known from the other methods , seem to show up as a singular behavior of the bound such as `` kinks '' saturating the constraint there @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "although the fundamental reason for such phenomena is not yet clear to us , we are convinced that these cfts do lie at the extreme corners of the conformal bootstrap constraints .",
    "in particular , the hypothesis that there exists a unitary cft at the singular point of the bound has led to the most numerically accurate prediction for the critical exponents of the @xmath4 ising model in @xcite .    meanwhile the previous studies have been focusing on space - time dimensions @xmath5 .",
    "one underlying theoretical presumption may be that we have much less knowledge for cfts in @xmath6 , where in the hamiltonian ( or lagrangian ) formulation , it is harder to prescribe stable ( i.e. bounded from below ) , uv - complete , and unitary interactions . despite the difficulty , in a recent paper @xcite they have argued that there exist @xmath0-symmetric cfts in @xmath7 dimension based on the @xmath8 expansion in @xmath9 dimension , which can be thought of as analogues of the critical @xmath0 vector models in @xmath10 dimension .    these models , if they exist in particular in @xmath11 dimension , are of physical interest in several contexts .",
    "the first is their unusual asymptotic safe behavior under the renormalization group flow , where these theories can be characterized as uv interacting fixed points of the @xmath0 symmetric hamiltonian , rather than the more conventional ir ones .",
    "the second is the ads@xmath12/cft@xmath13 correspondence , where the dual theories in the ads@xmath14 bulk include higher - spin fields in the large @xmath2 limit as the dual theories of critical @xmath0 vector models in @xmath15 dimension did in the ads@xmath16/cft@xmath17 correspondence @xcite ( for a recent review , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , setting @xmath18 in the asymptotic @xmath8 expansion would require careful treatment and nave expectation might fail .",
    "it is highly desirable to provide further evidence from non - perturbative methods such as the conformal bootstrap .    in this paper",
    ", we perform the conformal bootstrap program for @xmath0 symmetric cfts in @xmath11 dimension .",
    "the large @xmath2 prediction tells us that unlike what happens in @xmath15 dimension studied in @xcite , the proposed fixed point of the @xmath0 vector models in @xmath11 dimension can not saturate the bound for the conformal dimensions of the first scalar operator in the singlet as well as the symmetric traceless tensor representation .",
    "our strategy therefore is to investigate the other quantities such as the energy - momentum tensor central charge and the current central charge instead .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we collect some relevant aspects of the conformal fixed points proposed in @xcite and the conformal bootstrap program with the @xmath0 symmetry . in section 3",
    ", we present our numerical results of the conformal bootstrap in @xmath11 dimension . in section 4",
    "we present the results for the analogous computation in @xmath15 dimension for comparison . in section 5",
    ", we interpret our results with further discussions .",
    "in the hamiltonian formulation , the critical @xmath0 vector model is realized as the universality class of the @xmath0 symmetric hamiltonian : @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "this hamiltonian admits a natural @xmath8 expansion in @xmath21 dimension with the perturbative ir fixed point for @xmath22 , which is identified with the heisenberg fixed point in @xmath15 dimension ( at @xmath23 ) .",
    "our focus is the unconventional regime : @xmath24 ( @xmath25 or @xmath11 eventually ) . the hamiltonian becomes non - renormalizable in the power - counting sense , yet we may expect the existence of an asymptotic safe uv fixed point .",
    "the perturbative uv fixed point for small negative @xmath8 , however , leads to a negative value of @xmath26 , which may call for the question of instability while the anomalous dimensions still appear to be consistent with the unitarity bound .    on the other hand",
    ", we may perform the large @xmath2 expansion of .",
    "the analysis made perfect sense in @xmath27 as well as in @xmath28 .",
    "for sufficiently large @xmath2 , the known properties of the hypothetical uv fixed point do not contradict with the unitarity constraints of the cft .",
    "for later purposes , we collect the large @xmath2 predictions for critical @xmath0 vector models in @xmath15 and @xmath11 dimensions available in the literature @xcite@xcite ( see also @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "the conformal dimension of the scalar operator in @xmath0 vector representation ( i.e. @xmath29 in ) is @xmath30 for the first scalar operator in the @xmath0 singlet ( s ) representation , @xmath31 for the @xmath0 symmetric traceless tensor ( t ) representation , @xmath32 as observed in @xcite , the asymptotic behavior of the @xmath33 expansion in @xmath11 dimension is significantly worse than in @xmath15 dimension . assuming the @xmath34 prediction to be compatible with the unitarity bound @xmath35",
    ", @xcite predicted that unitary conformal fixed points exist for @xmath36 in @xmath11 dimension .",
    "@xmath33 corrections to the energy - momentum tensor central charge and the current central charge are available in @xcite : @xmath37 and @xmath38 which we have normalized by the values at the gaussian fixed point .    in @xcite , they have proposed an alternative uv complete description based on the hamiltonian @xmath39 where @xmath40 is an @xmath0 singlet . the hamiltonian allows a perturbative search of the fixed point in @xmath41 dimension . for sufficiently small @xmath8 , they found that for large @xmath42 , there is an ir stable fixed point corresponding to the critical @xmath0 vector models we have described above .",
    "they also found the other ( unstable ) fixed points for any @xmath2 that do not have the conventional @xmath33 expansions ( rather @xmath43 expansions ) .    in the following",
    ", we would like to investigate the conformal bootstrap program for @xmath0 symmetric cfts in @xmath11 dimension . before doing any numerical analysis",
    ", we immediately realize that in the large @xmath2 limit the critical @xmath0 vector models in @xmath11 dimension can not be seen as a  kink \" in the bound for the conformal dimensions in either s or t sector ( unlike the study in @xmath15 dimension @xcite ) because the conformal dimensions of these operators in the large @xmath2 limit are predicted to be smaller than those in the generalized free theories . indeed",
    ", the preliminary numerical conformal bootstrap confirms this .",
    "our strategy , therefore , is to study the lower bound of the energy - momentum tensor central charge and the current central charge .    before presenting the results ,",
    "let us briefly comment on the conformal bootstrap program for cfts with global @xmath0 symmetry , assuming the presence of a scalar field @xmath44 in the @xmath0 vector representation . the detailed prescription to obtain the lower bound of the energy momentum tensor central charge from the four point function @xmath45 has been given in @xcite for any @xmath46 , so we will not delineate them here , and we follow their notation . see also @xcite@xcite@xcite for further details on the bootstrap program with general global symmetries . to obtain the lower bound of the current central charge ,",
    "all we have to do is to change the normalization point of the linear functional @xmath47 from the energy - momentum tensor to the @xmath0 current @xcite ( see @xcite for a similar approach to current central charges in @xmath48 @xmath49 supersymmetric theories ) . in the actual computation ,",
    "the intermediate states with spin @xmath50 and @xmath51 are taken into account ( the latter is to include the asymptotic effects ) , and no assumption is made for the spectra other than the unitarity bound unless otherwise stated . to obtain a partial fractional approximation of the conformal blocks , we employed the algorithm of @xcite to generate the residues .",
    "all the results in this paper are derived from @xmath52 or @xmath53-dimensional search space which was sufficient in @xcite to see the kinks corresponding to the critical @xmath0 vector models in @xmath15 dimension .",
    "our ` sdpa - gmp`@xcite@xcite implementation is the same as in @xcite , except that the parameter ` precision ` is 350 here .",
    "let us now present our numerical results of the conformal bootstrap for the lower bound of the current central charge with @xmath54 in figure [ fig:1 ] along with the prediction of the @xmath55 and @xmath56 from the large @xmath2 expansion in ( [ eq : largen - deltaphi ] ) and ( [ eq : largen - currentcc ] ) . as we can see , the curves show sudden changes in their slopes after their local minima , and for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , their locations agree with the large @xmath2 predictions within our horizontal precisions , @xmath59 .",
    "for @xmath60 the behavior is similar , but there seems to be a small discrepancy between the location of the minimum and the large @xmath2 prediction . at this point , it is not clear to us if this discrepancy comes from the poor asymptotic @xmath33 expansions in @xmath11 dimension , or the possibility that the minimum does not correspond to the actual cft .    for reference",
    "we note that substituting @xmath60 into the @xmath61 term in ( [ eq : largen - deltaphi ] ) gives the value @xmath62 , which is comparable with the discrepancy here .     for @xmath11 @xmath0 symmetric cfts with @xmath63 .",
    "the dots are the large @xmath2 predictions of the @xmath64 in ( [ eq : largen - deltaphi ] ) and ( [ eq : largen - currentcc]).,width=302 ]    we continue to present the results for smaller values of @xmath2 in figure [ fig:2 ] .",
    "the disagreement between the locations of the local minima and the large @xmath2 predictions becomes even worse .",
    "while in @xcite they claim the absence of the unitary conformal fixed points for @xmath65 , we do not find any qualitative changes of the curves .",
    "in particular the local minima persist for any @xmath2 .     for @xmath11 @xmath0 symmetric cfts with @xmath66 .",
    "the dots are the large @xmath2 predictions of the @xmath67.,width=302 ]    finally , we present the lower bounds of the current central charge for @xmath68 in figure [ fig:3 ] along with those of the energy - momentum tensor central charge . for these values of @xmath2 , we also find non - trivial local minima for the lower bounds of the energy - momentum tensor central charge at the range close to where the lower bounds of the current central charge show the local minima . as we can see , the locations of the minima for the lower bounds of the energy - momentum tensor central charge do not necessarily coincide with those of the current central charge .     for @xmath11 @xmath0 symmetric cfts with @xmath69",
    "the solid lines are the lower bounds of the current central charge while the dashed lines are those of the energy - momentum tensor central charge with the corresponding colors .",
    ", width=302 ]    the large @xmath2 asymptotic slope for the bounds of the current central charge in the smaller @xmath70 region agrees with the large @xmath2 predictions from and .",
    "however , the similar asymptotic slope for the lower bounds of the energy - momentum tensor central charge disagrees with the large @xmath2 predictions of and",
    ". we will give possible interpretations of these facts in section 5 .",
    "one may further attempt to improve the above results by assuming additional conditions for the intermediate states in the conformal bootstrap .",
    "for example , in the literature @xcite@xcite@xcite , the conditions @xmath71 for spin @xmath72 intermediate states were imposed in @xmath15 dimension while the unitarity bound is weaker : @xmath73 .",
    "the additional assumption should be consistent with the cfts we would like to find : we know that the available spectra for the critical @xmath0 vector models ( either from the other sectors of the conformal bootstrap or from the other methods ) satisfy @xmath71 , so it should make the bound stronger without excluding them .    in our conformal bootstrap approach to the critical @xmath0 vector models in @xmath11 dimension for smaller @xmath2",
    ", however , we have less knowledge of the operator contents of the cfts we are looking for , nor there seems no other bootstrap sectors that give the prediction of the spectra ( as far as we have tried ) . therefore , a priori",
    ", we do not know what kind of extra assumptions make the bound stronger without excluding the non - trivial cfts .",
    "for an experiment , we have derived the lower bounds of the current central charge in the @xmath74 symmetric cfts with the assumptions @xmath75 for spin @xmath72 intermediate states by changing @xmath76 , whose results are shown in figure [ fig;5dso2-varyingcutoff ] .",
    "the bound is rather stable against shifting @xmath77 from @xmath78 to @xmath79 and then starts to move .",
    "however such a behavior does not immediately imply that there is an actual cft at the observed minimum saturating the lower bounds for @xmath80 or @xmath79 with a spin @xmath72 intermediate state whose conformal dimension is @xmath81 . to see what is happening",
    ", we will compare the situations in @xmath15 dimension in the next section .     for @xmath11 @xmath74 symmetric cfts obtained by assuming @xmath82 with @xmath77 running over @xmath83.,width=302 ]",
    "in order to better understand the situations in @xmath11 dimension , we have performed the similar analysis of the lower bounds of the current central charge in @xmath15 dimension for @xmath0 symmetric cfts . in particular",
    ", we would like to address the question if the local minima of the lower bounds of the current central charge can be associated with the critical @xmath0 vector models .    to keep the story in parallel with that in @xmath11 dimension",
    ", we have first derived the lower bounds from the conformal bootstrap program without assuming any additional conditions for the spectra of the intermediate states other than the unitarity bound ( which is @xmath84 for spin @xmath72 operators in @xmath15 dimension ) . for sufficiently large @xmath2 , figure [ fig:4 ]",
    "shows that the lower bounds of the current central charge possess the local minima as in @xmath11 dimension , and their locations in the large @xmath2 limit coincide with the large @xmath2 predictions of @xmath70 of the critical @xmath0 vector models .",
    "however , for smaller @xmath2 , we see that the location of the minimum begins to deviate from the @xmath70 predicted in the other sectors of the conformal bootstrap ( e.g. s or t sector ) in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath85 , the minimum of the lower bound of the current central charge disappears .     for @xmath15 @xmath0 symmetric cfts with @xmath86 .",
    "the bounds are completely general  i.e. no assumption other than the unitarity bound is made .",
    "the dots are the large @xmath2 predictions of @xmath87 for @xmath88 critical vector models from the left .",
    "[ fig:4],width=302 ]    for comparison we note that the location of the local minimum of the lower bound of the energy - momentum tensor central charge for @xmath1 , if any , does not coincide with either the @xmath70 predicted from the kinks in the @xmath89 and @xmath90 sectors or the minimum of the lower bound of the current central charge we obtained ( see fig 4 of @xcite ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the energy - momentum tensor central charge was successfully chosen as a good trial function for the precision conformal bootstrap program in the @xmath4 ising model .",
    "our results suggest that neither the energy - momentum tensor central charge nor the current central charge by themselves may be good candidates for the precision conformal bootstrap of the critical @xmath0 vector models in @xmath15 dimension except in the large @xmath2 limit for the latter . as stated at the end of the previous section , one may attempt to improve these bounds by examining the conformal bootstrap program with additional conditions , i.e. @xmath82 rather than the unitarity bound @xmath73 .",
    "while we have some knowledge of the spectra of operators here in @xmath15 dimension , we again vary @xmath76 to compare the situations in @xmath11 dimension .",
    "the results for the lower bound of the current central charge in the @xmath74 symmetric cfts are presented in figure [ fig:3dso2-varyingcutoff ] .",
    "the behavior under changing @xmath76 is similar to that in @xmath11 : at first stage it is rather stable and then starts to move , and it begins to show a  kink \" .",
    "although the bounds with the assumption @xmath91 and @xmath92 show a rather sharp `` kink '' around the values which we have expected in the critical @xmath74 vector model from our a - priori knowledge , we are forced to conclude that the critical @xmath74 vector model saturates _ none _ of these bounds because the other methods @xcite@xcite strongly suggest that the critical @xmath74 vector model does satisfy @xmath93 and thereby its current central charge must be bounded from below by the curve with @xmath94 .",
    "our results then imply that without a further input from the other sectors to tune the assumptions of the intermediate states , it seems difficult to use the current central charge itself as a trial function for the precision conformal bootstrap of the critical @xmath0 vector models .     for @xmath15 @xmath74 symmetric cfts with assuming @xmath95 for the spin @xmath72 intermediate states , with @xmath76 running over @xmath96.,width=302 ]",
    "in this paper , we have studied the conformal bootstrap program for @xmath0 symmetric cfts in @xmath11 dimension with particular emphasis on the lower bound on the current central charge . in the large @xmath2 limit ,",
    "given the agreement with the large @xmath2 analysis together with the more solid results in @xmath15 dimension , we are confident that the observed local minima correspond to the critical @xmath0 vector models discussed in @xcite .",
    "we , however , did not find any evidence for the conformal window proposed in @xcite .",
    "there are a couple of possible scenarios here .",
    "( 1 ) the conformal window does not exist : the critical @xmath0 vector models are unitary cfts for any @xmath1 . ( 2 ) at finite @xmath2 , there exist crossovers with the other fixed points such as the ones predicted in @xcite from the @xmath8 expansion in @xmath41 dimension .",
    "( 3 ) the conformal window does exist , but the lower bound of the current central charge did not capture it : the observed local minima do not correspond to any unitary cft .    in the first scenario , the discrepancy for finite @xmath2 in @xmath11 dimension could be explained by the poor asymptotic behavior of the large @xmath2 expansion . in the second scenario ,",
    "the discrepancy between the location of the local minimum in the lower bound of the energy - momentum tensor central charge and that of the current central charge could be understood as the existence of two ( or more ) distinct conformal fixed points within the same universality class .",
    "it would also explain the observed asymptotic slope of the lower bound of the energy - momentum tensor central charge that differs from the large @xmath2 prediction . in the third scenario ,",
    "the possible absence of cfts at the local minima of the bounds may have the same origin of the situations in @xmath15 dimension for smaller @xmath2 where the critical @xmath0 vector models do not saturate the bounds of the current central charge at the minima ( without tuning the extra assumptions for the intermediate states ) .",
    "it would be interesting to see if these puzzles in smaller @xmath2 can be resolved within the conformal bootstrap program .",
    "alternatively , to test these scenarios directly in @xmath11 dimension independently from the conformal bootstrap , we may perform the higher loop @xmath8 expansions with a careful resummation .    finally ,",
    "since our results appear to be robust in the large @xmath2 limit , the analysis of higher - spin current operators from the conformal bootstrap may be of practical use to establish its connection to the ads@xmath14/cft@xmath97 correspondence with higher - spin fields propagating in the bulk .",

    "<S> we investigate the conformal bootstrap approach to @xmath0 symmetric cfts in five dimension with particular emphasis on the lower bound on the current central charge . </S>",
    "<S> the bound has a local minimum for all @xmath1 , and in the large @xmath2 limit we propose that the minimum is saturated by the critical @xmath0 vector model at the uv fixed point , the existence of which has been recently argued by fei , giombi , and klebanov . </S>",
    "<S> the location of the minimum is generically different from the minimum of the lower bound of the energy - momentum tensor central charge when it exists for smaller @xmath2 . </S>",
