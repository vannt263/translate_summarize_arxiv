    "although the quantum manifestation of chaos has been extensively studied over the past few decades , to define `` quantum chaos '' is still the main problem in this field .",
    "the direct extension of the definition applicable to classical chaos seems to fail because of the linearity of the schrdinger equation .",
    "since quantum mechanics contains classical mechanics as a limit , however , there must be something in quantum mechanics that produces classical chaos in the classical limit .",
    "there have been many attempts to define a measure of quantum chaos .",
    "there are some measures using the level statistics , but much more information could be obtained from analysises of individual quantum states",
    ". we can classify measures of complexity of quantum states into two types :    1 .",
    "complexity of pure states 2 .",
    "complexity of an ensemble of quantum states    for example , the von neumann entropy of the density matrix belongs to type ( 2 ) . in this paper , we focus on complexity of type ( 1 ) .",
    "some quantities defined in terms of the expansion coefficients are often used in numerical calculations .",
    "for instance , suppose a quantum state is expanded in an appropriate basis @xmath0 : @xmath1 .",
    "then the information ( shannon ) entropy @xmath2 and moments of the distribution @xmath3 are measures of localization ( or delocalization ) with respect to this basis . in particular , the inverse of the second moment @xmath4 is called the number of principal components ( npc ) : it becomes unity when the state has only one component , while it becomes @xmath5 when the probability is equally distributed over @xmath5 basis vectors .",
    "such quantities are easy to calculate . however , an obvious defect is that the definition depends on the basis .",
    "wehrl has proposed a good measure of complexity of quantum states based on the husimi distribution function @xmath6 @xcite@xcite .",
    "he called it `` classical entropy '' , @xmath7 while in his paper `` quantum entropy '' denotes the von neumann entropy of a density matrix .",
    "note that the classical entropy is applicable and takes various values also for pure states , while the quantum entropy always vanishes for them .",
    "although wehrl introduced the classical entropy as an approximation to the quantum entropy , their values are not necessarily close even in the limit @xmath8 .",
    "( see the discussion in @xcite . )",
    "according to our classification , we discuss the classical entropy to describe complexity of type ( 1 ) , i.e. of pure states .",
    "chaoticity in classical mechanics can be characterized by the delocalization of orbits . in integrable systems",
    ", there are many constraints from symmetries , such that orbits are confined to low - dimensional tori .",
    "as the system becomes chaotic , the tori are destroyed and orbits can spread to higher dimensional space . in highly chaotic systems , orbits spread uniformly over the equi - energy surface .",
    "such systems are called ergodic . among the several conditions to characterize chaoticity of classical mechanics ,",
    "the ergodicity is a rather weak one .",
    "for example , any one - dimensional time - independent hamiltonian system is ergodic , but never chaotic .",
    "however , in physically natural situations of many - dimensional systems , the ergodicity works as a definition of classical chaos .",
    "we can expect a similar behavior in quantum mechanics .",
    "the husimi function is a function on phase space , and takes only non - negative values while the wigner function can be negative and is usually violently oscillating @xcite .",
    "hence the husimi function can be regarded as a probability distribution in phase space , and its order of delocalization can be a measure of chaoticity of quantum states . in that sense ,",
    "wehrl s classical entropy seems to be a good candidate measure .    however , wehrl s entropy is defined as an integral over phase space , and is not easy to calculate numerically . to the best of the authors knowledge , there is no calculation for a more than one - dimensional system .",
    "( a calculation for a one - dimensional time - driven system is in @xcite . )",
    "the difficulty mainly comes from the redundancy of the husimi function : the husimi function of @xmath9 dimensional system is a function on @xmath10 dimensional space , while a function on @xmath9 dimensional space is enough to keep the same information in either coordinate or momentum representation .",
    "complex pure quantum states are usually represented as sets of expansion coefficients with respect to a basis",
    ". this will be the case also in our following discussion .",
    "when we calculate wehrl s entropy of a quantum state , the normal procedure is the following :    1 .",
    "calculate the husimi function @xmath11 on many sampling points @xmath12 .",
    "2 .   take an average @xmath13 over the sampling points",
    ".    however , this procedure seems to be overly excessive because we have all the information about the quantum state in the set of expansion coefficients .",
    "there must exists some formula to calculate the average directly from the coefficients .",
    "the main concern of this paper is to avoid the redundancy of the husimi function in numerical evaluation of a suitable measure of complexity . in other words ,",
    "we wish to know how to get some averages related to the husimi function without actually calculating the husimi function itself .",
    "it seems difficult to derive a simple formula for the entropy because of the transcendental logarithmic function .",
    "however , a simple formula is possible for an algebraic function .",
    "the second moment , which is the average of the square of the distribution function , is especially easy to calculate .",
    "we will show later a formula in which the second moment of the husimi distribution is expressed directly in terms of expansion coefficients in the harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "( if the quantum states are given by expansion coefficients in another basis , we should calculate the transformation matrix and change the basis to the harmonic oscillator basis . )",
    "the numerical effort is of order @xmath14 for a quantum state where @xmath15 is the number of basis vectors .",
    "if we calculate the second moments for all quantum states given by diagonalization of a @xmath16 matrix , the numerical effort is of order @xmath17 , which is the same as the order of the diagonalization of the matrix .",
    "we represent the inverse of the second moment by @xmath18 : @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath18 represents the effective phase space volume occupied by the husimi function .",
    "for example , if @xmath11 takes the same value over a region with volume @xmath21 and takes zero value outside of it , @xmath22 .",
    "the unit of @xmath18 is the planck cell volume .",
    "next we summarize the main points of this paper .",
    "we use the second moment of the husimi distribution to define complexity of quantum states .",
    "it is a measure of delocalization of the husimi distribution in phase space .",
    "it is defined in a base - independent way and has a good correspondence with complexity of classical mechanics .",
    "moreover , we can calculate it directly from expansion coefficients , without calculating the redundant husimi function .",
    "therefore it is not so difficult to evaluate numerically .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ husimi ] we summarize the definition and some properties of the husimi distribution function . in section [ second ]",
    "we derive the formula to calculate the second moment of the husimi distribution directly from expansion coefficients in the harmonic oscillator basis . in section",
    "[ numerical ] we introduce a model hamiltonian and show numerical results which illustrate the meaning of @xmath18 as a measure of complexity .",
    "the final section is devoted to a summary . in appendix",
    "we show details of semiclassical calculations of the second moment of the husimi distribution in integrable and ergodic limits .",
    "in this section , we review some properties of the husimi function @xcite . we restrict ourselves to a one - dimensional system for simplicity , but the generalization to many - dimensional systems is straightforward .    the husimi function of a quantum state @xmath23 is defined as @xmath24 here , @xmath25 is a coherent state defined as an eigenstate for a complex eigenvalue @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 is an operator with @xmath29 as an arbitrary parameter @xmath30 the real and imaginary parts of @xmath26 are related to the phase space point @xmath31 by @xmath32    it is not difficult to derive the relation @xmath33,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the wigner function @xmath35 a state @xmath36 represents an eigenstate of the coordinate representation .",
    "there we see that the husimi function is a kind of the coarse - grained wigner function .",
    "the main advantage of the husimi function is that it is non - negative , as is obvious from the definition ( [ def ] ) .",
    "hence the husimi function can be formally regarded as a probability distribution , whereas the wigner function can not .",
    "in this section , we consider the second moment of the husimi distribution @xmath37 here and in the following we omit @xmath29 for simplicity .",
    "suppose the quantum state @xmath23 is represented in the harmonic oscillator basis @xmath38 then @xmath39 can be expanded as @xmath40 here , we used the following formulas @xmath41 and @xmath42 as a result , we obtain the formula @xmath43 where @xmath44 since there is a truncation @xmath45 in the expansion ( [ expand ] ) in any real calculation , the sum ( [ sum_m2 ] ) is also finite .",
    "the numerical effort is of order @xmath14 for a quantum state .",
    "the generalization to many - dimensional systems is straightforward .",
    "the result is @xmath46 where @xmath9 is the dimension of the system and @xmath47 here , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are @xmath9-dimensional vectors whose components are non - negative integers .",
    "the factorial of those vectors means the product of all factorials of the vector components .",
    "for example , @xmath50 the absolute value denotes @xmath51 and @xmath52 means @xmath53 for @xmath54 .",
    "the model hamiltonian we are considering here is that of a two - dimensional quartic oscillator @xmath55 which has been adopted by many authors for the studies of level statistics and wave functions @xcite .",
    "we put @xmath56 and regard all quantities as dimensionless .",
    "this model has the simple scaling property , @xmath57 which means that the energy of the system does not essentially change the dynamics .",
    "however , the parameter @xmath9 changes the nature of the system .",
    "the system is separable and integrable at @xmath58 , and becomes chaotic as @xmath9 increases .",
    "it is unbound for @xmath59 .",
    "meyer @xcite has shown that for large @xmath9 values ( @xmath60 ) the classical phase space structure is almost completely chaotic .",
    "this system has a discrete symmetry called @xmath61 : the hamiltonian is invariant with respect to reflections about @xmath62-axis , @xmath63-axis and also about the line @xmath64 . in this paper",
    "we treat only quantum states which are symmetric under all reflections .",
    "( this symmetry class is labeled @xmath65 in @xcite . )",
    "fig.[section ] shows the poincar surfaces of section of this system at @xmath66 and @xmath67 . at @xmath68 , the phase space is completely occupied by tori .",
    "these tori are partially destroyed at @xmath69 , and most of them seem to vanish at @xmath70 . however , there are still many islands of stability .",
    "the two most significant islands are at @xmath71 .",
    "these correspond to the stable linear orbits on @xmath64 and @xmath72 . at @xmath73",
    ", we can not recognize any structure . in this case , more than 90% of the orbits are unstable according to @xcite .",
    "we diagonalize the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) in the harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "the procedure we used is essentially the same as that of zimmermann _ et al .",
    "the bases belonging to @xmath65 can be written as @xmath74 and @xmath75 are even non - negative integer and @xmath76 .",
    "matrix elements of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) can be calculated analytically , and we obtain eigenenergies and eigenstates by the diagonalization of this matrix .",
    "the truncated hilbert space is spanned by the basis vectors with @xmath77 , whose dimension is 4692 .    among the 4692 eigenstates we obtain by the diagonalization , those having very large energies are not reliable because of the truncation error .",
    "since the range of the validity very much depends on the oscillator frequency @xmath78 of the harmonic oscillator basis , we should choose @xmath78 to optimize the diagonalization . because of the variational principle , eigenvalues obtained in the restricted hilbert space are always higher than the real values , and the level density in that space is always smaller than the real one .",
    "therefore the minimization of @xmath79 ( the sum of the eigenvalues ) can be a criterion to choose the optimal @xmath78 .",
    "we put @xmath80 , which is chosen roughly to optimize the diagonalization for @xmath73 , for all @xmath9 . the comparison between the obtained level density and the semiclassical",

    ".    there may be several reasons for this .",
    "one reason we can think of is that the wigner function in the berry - voros hypothesis does not satisfy the pure state condition of the density matrix @xmath96 .",
    "therefore we might obtain better estimates of @xmath18 by taking into account the pure state condition by successive iterations .",
    "( see chapter 8 in @xcite . )",
    "another reason , which seems more important , is that there are weak localization phenomena like _ scars _ @xcite .",
    "we found many scarred eigenstates with small @xmath18 at @xmath73 .    at low energies ( @xmath97 ) ,",
    "@xmath18 of some eigenstates reach the ergodic limit irrespective of the value of @xmath9 , but the figures of these wave functions does not seem chaotic . the reason for this is probably that the semiclassical approximation we used here is not good in this region . our approximation is based on the idea that the local volume occupied by the husimi distribution is the volume element of the invariant manifold ( invariant torus or equi - energy surface ) multiplied by the thickness factor of order @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the codimension of the manifold .",
    "( see appendix [ semi ] . ) however , this approximation fails when the scale of the invariant manifold is comparable to the planck constant .",

    "[ im2k4 ] and [ npc ] ( c ) .",
    "however , the values of the npc are not so small , and there are many states lower than the series which seem to have no clear structure .",
    "therefore , in general , @xmath18 seems more reliable than the npc as a measure of complexity of quantum states .",

    "importance of these eigenstates in the response function has been reported in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we proposed the second moment of the husimi distribution as a definition of complexity of quantum states .",
    "its inverse ( we represent it by @xmath18 ) shows the effective volume occupied by the husimi distribution function , and serves as a measure of delocalization in phase space .",
    "we calculated it for a quartic oscillator model , and showed that it has a good correspondence with chaoticity of the classical system .",
    "we can calculate it directly from expansion coefficients without numerical integration .",
