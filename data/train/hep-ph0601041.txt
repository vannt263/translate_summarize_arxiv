    "the natural prediction of thermal - relic dark matter is usually considered as one of the most attractive features of models with low - energy supersymmetry .",

    "here we want to argue that , although dark matter was certainly a natural prediction of supersymmetry in the pre - lep epoch , it is generically no longer true , at a quantitative level , after lep data are taken into account . to illustrate the problem , let us consider the supersymmetric extension of the standard model with minimal field content , and with general soft terms .",

    ", a description of the neutralino in terms of current eigenstates is becoming increasingly appropriate .",
    "we will then start our discussion with the case in which the neutralino is pure bino , wino or higgsino and later generalize to mixed states .",
    "the bino is a gauge singlet whose annihilation in the early universe occurs through squark and slepton exchange . since sleptons are usually lighter than squarks and right - handed sleptons have the largest hypercharge , the bino annihilation cross section and its contribution to the present @xmath6 are well approximated by _",

    "then , requiring that dark matter is constituted by relic binos , we find that implies @xmath15 at 95% cl .",
    "present lep limits  @xcite require @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 at 95% cl ( for neutralino mass of 40  gev ) .",
    "therefore , while before lep a pure bino appeared as an adequate dark - matter candidate in broad range of parameters , after lep the typical prediction is that the bino relic density is too large .",
    "as it is well known , agreement with dark - matter observation can still be achieved under special conditions on the supersymmetry soft terms .",
    "one well - studied possibility  @xcite is that the bino and the lightest slepton ( usually the stau ) are nearly degenerate in mass , so that co - annihilation  @xcite reduces the relic abundance .",
    "this requires a rather precise correlation among parameters , @xmath19 .",
    "another possibility to reduce the relic abundance is to exploit an almost - resonant @xmath20-channel annihilation  @xcite .",
    "this requires @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the mass of the cp - odd or the heavy cp - even higgs boson .",
    "the occurrance of resonant light - higgs exchange is almost ruled out by data .",
    "there are also alternative ways to reduce the bino relic density , which however depend somehow on the cosmological history . if the reheat temperature after a period of entropy production @xmath23 is lower than the freeze - out temperature @xmath24 , than the actual dark - matter relic density can be much smaller than what is estimated by the usual thermal calculation  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the final abundance has a steep dependence on @xmath23 .",
    "a different possibility is to assume that the bino is only the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) , allowing for its decay .",
    "if the true lsp is sufficiently weakly coupled to have a negligible thermal relic abundance , but strongly - enough coupled for the bino decay to be cosmologically harmless , then @xmath25 can be reconciled with data , for an appropriate value of @xmath26 .",
    "the gravitino is the most motivated candidate for this scenario  @xcite , but the more exotic cases of axino or modulino have also been considered  @xcite .",
    "a difficulty often encountered in this approach is that the late bino decay can upset the usual nucleosynthesis predictions .",
    "take the case of a gravitino with mass @xmath27 .",
    "if we require that the bino decay occurs before the onset of nucleosynthesis , then @xmath28 . to obtain a sufficient @xmath29 from bino decay with such a low value of @xmath27 , it is necessary to have @xmath30 .",
    "otherwise the impact of the decay on nucleosynthesis has to be carefully studied , and indeed the case of a nlsp neutralino is excluded  @xcite . the situation is better for a @xmath31 nlsp  @xcite , but a recent analysis  @xcite claims that , in the context of the minimal supergravity model , a dark - matter gravitino coming from @xmath31 decay is also excluded . a way out is to rely on a thermal population of gravitinos , but then the relic - abundance prediction is sensitive on initial cosmological conditions , through @xmath23 .      the higgsino is traditionally considered a less favourable dark - matter candidate , because it is not the lsp in constrained supersymmetric models and because its annihilation cross section is very efficient .",
    "the first argument is very much tied to the assumption of universality where a large higgsino mass @xmath32 is necessary to cancel the positive contribution to @xmath33 from all other soft terms , in the radiative electroweak mechanism .",

    "such large values of @xmath32 require a significant fine - tuning in order to reproduce the weak scale and are at odds with the original motivation of supersymmetry .",
    "they are acceptable in the case of split supersymmetry  @xcite , where supersymmetry is not required to solve the hierarchy problem .",
    "moreover , such large values of the lsp mass typically bring the supersymmetric spectrum beyond the reach of the lhc .    as in the case of the bino , by invoking solutions that depend on initial cosmological conditions",

    "the prediction for @xmath5 could certainly vary with the parameters , and the physical value could be obtained only for particular choices .",

    "why then should we expect to have an extra tuning to get well - tempered neutralinos ?",
    "it is difficult to answer this question without having a more precise notion of what the physical measure of tuning actually is , but we can at least identify a competition between two factors .",
    "if we scale up the wino to 2.5   tev as the lsp , so there is no tuning for dark matter , we are making the scalars heavier too , which makes electroweak breaking more tuned .",
    "if we leave winos in the hundreds of gev range , the scalars are lighter and electroweak breaking is less tuned but there is more tuning to get the dark matter . at any rate , a 2.5  tev wino make split supersymmetry invisible at the lhc ( for conventional gaugino mass relations )",
    ". therefore the collider detectability of split supersymmetry relies on the existence of well - tempered neutralinos .",
    "of course this conclusion depends on our assumption that the dark matter is entirely composed of the thermal relic .",
    "it is possible that the cosmological history is more involved .",
    "for instance , in the minimal version of split supersymmetry with gravitinos near @xmath209 , for a high reheating temperature the gravitinos are produced with sufficient abundance so that their ( safe ) decay before nucleosynthesis nonetheless significantly dilutes the lsp abundance .",
    "depending on the presence of other light moduli fields with masses around @xmath210 , the lsps can be repopulated , and so lighter lsps can form the dark matter , with a visible gluino at the lhc @xcite .",
    "alternately , there may be more than one source of dark matter , for instance not just our lsp but also axions .",
    "it is further plausible that the dark - matter abundance is  environmentally \" selected for @xcite . in this case , both the initial amplitude of the axion as well as the scale of gaugino masses need to be lowered in order to get a small enough dark - matter abundance , but it is reasonable to expect comparable abundances from each one . this would again mean that we could have a lighter lsp , now providing an @xmath211 fraction of the dm , but again with a spectrum visible at the lhc",
