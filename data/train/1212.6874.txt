    "the deceleration parameter , @xmath0 , is poorly known at present .",
    "this is why many parameterizations of this key quantity , such as @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and more complex than these , has been proposed to reconstruct @xmath6 from observational data ( see e.g. refs .",
    "- ) . however , the first parameterization is appropriate for @xmath7 only , and the others diverge in the far future ( as @xmath8 ) .",
    "here we propose three model independent parameterizations of @xmath6 with two free parameters only , valid from matter domination ( @xmath9 ) onwards ( i.e. , up to @xmath10 ) , based on practical and theoretical reasons and independent of any cosmological model .",
    "they obey by construction the asymptotic conditions , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and a further condition , @xmath13 , which is valid at least when @xmath14 .",
    "the first one arises because at sufficiently high redshift the universe was matter dominated .",
    "the other conditions are based on the second law of thermodynamics when account is made of the entropy of the causal horizon .",
    "the latter dominates over all other entropy sources@xcite and is proportional to the horizon area , @xmath15 .",
    "then , the second law of thermodynamics@xcite imposes @xmath16 at all times , and @xmath17 at least at late times ( derivatives are taken with respect to the scale factor ) .",
    "this translates into @xmath18 ( at any redshift ) , and that @xmath14 and @xmath19 as @xmath20 ( see ref .   for details ) .",
    "usually one parameterizes a function in any specific interval by interpolating it between the two end points of the interval ( modulo one first knows the value taken by the function at these two points ) . in actual fact",
    ", the parameterizations of @xmath6 proposed so far have just one fixed point : the asymptotic value at high redshift ( @xmath21 must converge to @xmath22 when @xmath9 ) . the other , @xmath23 , is not in reality a fixed point because the value of the deceleration parameter at @xmath24 is not very well known and it is therefore left free . the parameterizations proposed here have two fixed points , one at the far past ( @xmath25 ) , and other at the far future ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the second fixed point conforms to the thermodynamical constraints imposed by the second law .",
    "we believe this means a clear advantage over previous parameterizations of @xmath6 , with just one fixed point .",
    "while in the literature it can be found parameterizations that also fix @xmath21 at @xmath10 they do so arbitrarily , i.e. , not grounded on sound physics .",
    "we propose three parameterizations of @xmath6 , namely : @xmath27 @xmath28 and @xmath29 all of them satisfy the conditions stated above .",
    "their two free parameters , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , were constrained using data from sn ia ( 557 data points ) , bao combined with cmb ( 7 data points ) and the history of the hubble factor ( 24 data points ) .",
    "table [ aba : tbl1 ] shows their best fit values and their 1@xmath32 confidence levels .",
    "likewise , figure [ aba : fig1 ] depicts the corresponding @xmath6 graphs and that of the @xmath33cdm model fitted to the same sets of data .",
    "details can be found in ref . .",
    "[ aba : tbl1 ]    table [ aba : tbl2 ] gives hubble s constant , @xmath34 ( in km / s / mpc ) , the age of the universe , @xmath35 ( in gyr ) , the deceleration parameter , @xmath23 , and the redshift , @xmath36 , of the transition deceleration - acceleration predicted for the three parameterizations , and the flat @xmath33cdm model .",
    "the latter is included for comparison .",
    "[ aba : tbl2 ]",
    "the three parameterizations proposed here rest solely on the assumptions that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic at large scales and on the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "they agree very well with each other ( especially the first and third ) and with the @xmath33cdm model .",
    "likewise , they also concord with the measurements reported by daly _",
    "et al . _ ,",
    ", in the redshift interval @xmath37 .",
    "it is worthy of mention that , as argued in ref .  , our restriction to spatially flat models ( @xmath38 ) is , in reality , very light and well justified .",
