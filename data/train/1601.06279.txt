    "the purpose of this paper is to give , in the @xmath0-scenario of uniform hyperbolicity , a characterization of those invariant measures that satisfy pesin s entropy formula in terms of their physical - like properties .",
    "our main result works , for @xmath0 anosov diffeomorphisms , as ledrappier - young characterization @xcite of the measures @xmath2 that satisfy pesin s entropy formula ( which holds in the @xmath3 context but not in the general @xmath0 context ) , by substituting the property of absolute continuity of the unstable conditional decomposition of @xmath2 , by the weak pseudo - physical property of its ergodic decomposition .",
    "pesin theory @xcite gives relevant tools and results of the modern differentiable ergodic theory .",
    "it works for @xmath3 ( or at least @xmath0 plus hlder ) dynamical systems .",
    "for instance , for @xmath3 hyperbolic systems , pesin s entropy formula computes exactly the metric entropy of a diffeomorphism in terms of the mean value of the sum of its positive lyaypunov exponents . in the @xmath3 scenario ,",
    "pesin s entropy formula holds if and only if the invariant measure has absolutely continuous conditional decomposition along the unstable manifolds .",
    ".    through the properties of absolute continuity of invariant measures , and mainly through the absolute continuity of the holonomy along the invariant foliations , pesin theory gives the tools to construct physically significant invariant measures for @xmath0-plus hlder systems . among these measures , the so called sinai - ruelle - bowen ( srb ) measures @xcite ,",
    "have particular relevance to describe the asymptotic statistics of lebesgue - positive set of orbits , not only for @xmath0 plus hlder uniform and non - uniform hyperbolic systems , but also for @xmath0 plus hlder partially hyperbolic systems @xcite .",
    "precisely , one of the most relevant properties of ergodic srb measures for @xmath0 plus hlder hyperbolic systems , is that they are _ physical ; _ namely , their basins of statistical attraction have positive lebesgue measure , even for lebesgue non - preserving systems . _ _    in particular , for transitive anosov @xmath0 plus hlder systems , the theorem of pesin - sinai ( see for instance @xcite ) states that there exists a unique physical measure : it is the unique invariant probability measure that satisfies pesin s entropy formula , and so , the only one with absolutely continuous conditional measures along the unstable foliation .",
    "besides , its basin of statistical attraction covers lebesgue all the orbits . in other words , for a @xmath0 plus hlder anosov system , the definition of physical measure , srb measure , and measure that satisfies pesin s entropy formula , are equivalent .    nevertheless , in the @xmath0-scenario , the above results do not work , because the theorems of pesin theory that ensure the absolute continuity of unstable conditional measures , and of the holonomies along invariant foliations , fail .",
    "even the existence of the unstable manifolds , along which one could construct the conditional unstable measures , fails in the @xmath0 context @xcite . in the particular case of @xmath0-anosov diffeomorphisms ,",
    "invariant @xmath4 foliations with @xmath0 leaves do exist ( see for instance @xcite ) , but the holonomies along the invariant foliations are not necessarily absolutely continuous @xcite .    as a consequence , for @xmath0 systems ,",
    "if one defined srb measures by the existence of their absolutely continuous unstable conditional measures , one would lack the hope to construct them .",
    "nevertheless , one can still define srb or srb - like measures , if one forgets for a while the properties of absolute continuity , and focus the attention of the properties of statistical attraction . in other words , one can try to look directly at their physical properties , dodging the lack of conditional absolute continuity . for that reason , in the @xmath0-scenario , we look for the lebesgue abundance of points in their statistical basins ( or , more precisely , in the @xmath5-approach of their statistical basins ) .",
    "this search was used in @xcite to construct the srb - like or pseudo - physical measures for @xmath4 dynamical systems on a compact riemannian manifold .",
    "the notion of srb - like or pseudo - physical measures , even in a non differentiable context , translate to the space of probability measures the concept of statistical attraction defined by ilyashenko @xcite in the ambient manifold .    in @xcite",
    "it is proved that @xmath0 _ generically , _ transitive and uniformly hyperbolic systems do have a unique measure satisfying pesin s entropy formula . besides this measure is physical and its basin of statistical attraction covers lebesgue almost all the orbits . in the general @xmath0-scenario with non uniform hyperbolicity ,",
    "pesin s entropy formula was first proved considering systems that preserve a smooth measure ( we call a measure @xmath2 smooth if @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the lebesgue measure ) .",
    "in fact , for @xmath0 generic diffeomorphisms that preserve a smooth measure @xmath2 , @xcite proved that @xmath2 satisfies pesin s entropy formula .",
    "later , in @xcite , this formula was also proved for any @xmath0 partially hyperbolic system that preserves a smooth measure . _ _    if no smooth measure is preserved , in @xcite is proved that the pseudo - physical or srb - like measures still exist and satisfy pesin s entropy formula , provided that the system is @xmath0 partially hyperbolic .",
    "recently , and also for @xmath0 partially hyperbolic systems , @xcite derived a proof of shub s entropy conjecture @xcite from their method of construction of measures that satisfy pesin s entropy formula .",
    "in this paper we focus on @xmath0 anosov systems to search for a converse of the result in @xcite .",
    "namely , our purpose is to characterize all the invariant measures that satisfy pesin s entropy formula .",
    "first , we need to generalize the concept of pseudo - physical or srb - like measure .",
    "so , we define the _ weak pseudo physical _ measures @xmath2 , by taking into account only the @xmath5-approach of its basin of statistical attraction up to time @xmath8 , which we denote by @xmath9 , and the exponential rate of the variation of the lebesgue measure of @xmath9 when @xmath10 ( definition [ definitionweakpseudophysicalmeasure ] ) . in theorem [ propositionweaklypseudophysicalmeasures ]",
    "we study general properties of the weak pseudo physical measures , which do always exist .",
    "we prove that for any @xmath0 anosov diffeomorphism , the weak pseudo - physical measures satisfy pesin s entropy formula ( part a ) of theorem [ maintheo ] ) . besides , we prove a converse result , to conclude that the set of invariant measures that satisfy pesin s entropy formula is the closed convex hull of the weak pseudo - physical measures ( theorem [ maintheo ] ) . _ _",
    "so , theorem [ maintheo ] characterizes all the measures that satisfy pesin s entropy formula in terms of the statistical properties that define the weak pseudo - physical notion .",
    "nevertheless , as far as we know , no example is still known of a @xmath11 anosov diffeomorphism for which weak pseudo - physical measures are not physical . in other words , there are not known examples of @xmath0-anosov systems such that an ergodic measure satisfies pesin s entropy formula and is non physical .",
    "the proof of theorem [ maintheo ] is based on the construction of local @xmath0 pseudo - unstable foliations , which approach the local @xmath4 unstable foliation , and allow us to apply a fubini decomposition of the lebesgue measure of the @xmath5-basin @xmath9 , for any ergodic measure @xmath2 .",
    "the pseudo - unstable foliations are constructed via hadamard graphs whose future iterates have bounded dispersion .",
    "this method was introduced by ma in @xcite to prove pesin s entropy formula in the @xmath0 plus hlder context .",
    "much later , it was applied also to @xmath0 systems in @xcite and @xcite .    as said above , in theorem [ maintheo ] of this paper",
    ", we prove that the weak pseudo - physical condition for the ergodic components of an invariant measure , is necessary and sufficient to satisfy pesin s entropy formula .",
    "the sufficient condition is just a corollary of the results in @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "the proof of the necessary condition is new , although it is also strongly based on ma s method to construct , via hadamard graphs , the @xmath0-pseudo unstable foliations .    as a subproduct of the proof of theorem [ maintheo ] , we also obtain an equality for any ergodic measure of a @xmath0-anosov diffeomorphism , even for measures that do not satisfy pesin s entropy formula .",
    "this equality , which is stated in theorem [ maintheorem3 ] , considers the exponential rate @xmath12 according to which the lebesgue measure of the @xmath5-basin @xmath13 of each ergodic measure @xmath2 varies with time @xmath8 .",
    "theorem [ maintheorem3 ] equals the exponential rate @xmath14 with the difference @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the metric entropy and @xmath17 are the positive lyapunov exponents .",
