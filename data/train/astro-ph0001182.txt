    "in the current cosmological picture , galaxies , clusters and large - scale structures have grown from initial small perturbations in the density of the universe via gravitational collapse .",
    "cosmological models are required to meet two basic observational constraints : on the one hand the universe at @xmath1 was very smooth , as the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is seen to have anisotropies of amplitude @xmath2 ; on the other hand local mass inhomogeneities measured through the distribution of galaxies exhibit fluctuations of the order @xmath3 on scales @xmath4 .",
    "different cosmologies , however , predict highly discrepant ways in which structures on different scales grow up to the current state from the cmb initial conditions .",
    "the largest discrepancies occur at redshifts @xmath5 which is when galaxies began to collapse and to form stars . accessing these intermediate redshifts",
    "will provide crucial tests for the cosmological models .",
    "the isotropy of the cosmic x - ray background ( xrb ) on large angular scales ( @xmath6 less than a few % on scales of degrees and larger ) suggests that most of the x - ray photons we receive from the universe must have been originated in the distant universe .",
    "surveys at different depths carried out with @xmath7 have revealed that 50 - 70% of the ( soft ) xrb is resolved into point sources , mostly active galactic nuclei ( agn ) of different classes .",
    "although there are still some discrepancies in the determination of the x - ray luminosity function and its redshift evolution , there is no doubt that most of the xrb originates at redshift @xmath8 .",
    "boyle et al ( 1994 ) and page et al ( 1996 ) who find their samples of x - ray selected agn consistent with pure luminosity evolution models , predict a peak in the x - ray volume emissivity around @xmath9 .",
    "miyaji et al ( 1998 ) instead find better consistency with luminosity dependent density evolution , in which case the x - ray volume emissivity in agn more luminous than @xmath10 ( which for the broken power - law shape of the luminosity function account for most of the x - rays emitted by agn ) rises steeply from @xmath11 to @xmath12 with no evidence for a decline at higher redshifts . in both cases",
    "it is clear that soft x - ray emission from the extragalactic sky comes mostly from redshifts @xmath12 or larger , in a situation very similar to the star formation in the universe ( madau et al 1996 , boyle & terlevich 1998 ) .",
    "studying the x - ray universe is then likely to provide a major handle to understand the evolution of the universe at intermediate redshifts and therefore it is an issue of prime cosmological relevance .",
    "there are other reasons to prefer x - rays to carry out cosmological studies . on the one hand",
    "the high - latitude x - ray sky is ` clean ' , at least at photon energies above 2 kev , galactic absorption has negligible effects and the contribution of the galaxy to the xrb is less than a few % ( iwan et al 1982 ) .",
    "a further reason is the small content in stars of high galactic latitude surveys , ranging from 25% at bright fluxes down to probably less than 10% at the faintest fluxes .    in this paper",
    "we review the current status of studies of the large - scale structure of the universe , which up to now has produced relevant but certainly not spectacular results .",
    "the two main questions that we address are :    * do x - ray sources ( and the xrb ) trace mass in the universe and what is their bias parameter ? * what are the best observational approaches to obtain information on the large - scale structure of the universe at intermediate redshifts with x - rays ?",
    "except when otherwise stated we use @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the distribution of the xrb fluctuations on the largest scales and their link to inhomogeneities in the distribution of matter has been an active field of research for many years .",
    "the observational resources have been mostly limited to the heao-1 a2 experiment which scanned the sky with a resolution of @xmath16 at photon energies 2 - 60 kev .",
    "since the galaxy is moving with respect to the frame where the cmb would be isotropic towards @xmath17 , there must be an overdensity of sources which are pulling us towards that direction .",
    "the distribution of x - ray sources in the sky should therefore exhibit an approximate large - scale dipolar distribution pointing towards the same direction .    using the agns in the piccinotti et al ( 1982 ) flux - limited sample of x - ray sources ( 2 - 10 kev flux limit @xmath18 )",
    ", miyaji & boldt ( 1990 ) and miyaji ( 1994 ) found the dipole of these sources to point towards @xmath19 with a large error circle ( @xmath20 radius ) .",
    "the dipole appears to saturate at @xmath21 and is roughly aligned with the cmb dipole . within the framework of linear theory , this allows the bias parameter of the x - ray selected agn to be estimated , giving a somewhat large value ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "uncertainties come primarily from the indetermination of the redshift at which the dipole saturates .",
    "plionis & kolokotronis ( 1998 ) and kolokotronis et al ( 1998 ) have measured the dipole of an x - ray flux - limited sample of galaxy clusters .",
    "this is again in rough alignment with the cmb dipole , but it appears to saturate at @xmath23 . as expected in all popular scenarios where clusters arise in extreme peaks of the underlying dark - matter distribution , they exhibit a large bias parameter ( @xmath24 , see table 4 ) .",
    ".dipoles of x - ray source populations and the xrb .",
    "references are fixsen et al ( 1996 ) ; mb80 : miyaji & boldt ( 1980 ) ; pk98 : plionis & kolokotronis ( 1998 ) ; pg99 : plionis & georgantopoulos ( 1999 ) ; s99 : scharf et al ( 1999 ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     as expected , clusters are a largely biased population ( @xmath24 ) compared to agn ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the multipoles of the xrb are expected to be dominated by agn , as these objects are the main sources of the xrb .",
    "the bias parameter derived from the xrb multipoles is consistently in agreement with the bias parameter derived from agn clustering ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the exception to this is the xrb dipole which implies a larger value of @xmath25 .",
    "this could be partly due to a larger cluster contribution , as the lowest order multipoles are most sensitive to nearest ( and brightest ) sources , where the cluster contribution to the source counts ( @xmath26 on average in the deep extragalactic surveys ) is @xmath27 for the piccinotti et al ( 1982 ) sample .",
    "x - ray astronomy is now in a position to address cosmological studies .",
    "x - ray selected agn which produce most of the x - rays in the universe , appear to trace mass with a moderate bias parameter @xmath0 , but that has to be better defined as a function of scale and redshift .",
    "@xmath28 and xmm will carry out several deep ` pencil beam ' surveys which , after subsequent identification of the serendipitous sources discovered , will define the redshift evolution of the agn x - ray luminosity function at photon energies @xmath29 and therefore the x - ray volume emissivity as a function of redshift .",
    "however , these surveys will not map sufficiently large areas of the sky which are necessary to trace the large - scale structure of the universe at the redshifts where the xrb was produced .",
    "the obvious way to go would be to survey very large areas of the sky ( the whole sky even better ) for x - ray sources , in order to have a most complete picture .",
    "unless hard x - rays are produced at significantly lower redshifts than soft x - rays ( which is doubtful in view of the @xmath30 and _ bepposax _ surveys ) , to reach @xmath31 where a significant fraction of the x - ray emissivity in the universe resides , these surveys will have to go at least down to @xmath32 .",
    "there is an alternative which is to perform high sensitivity observations of the xrb with a beam corresponding to the linear scale to be probed ( barcons , fabian & carrera 1998 ) .",
    "as the peak of the power spectrum of the density field of the universe occurs at comoving wavenumbers @xmath33 , for a standard geometry a @xmath34 resolution is well matched to this at @xmath35 .",
    "all - sky measurements of the xrb intensity on that angular scale with a precision of a few % could then be used to detect the excess fluctuations due to source clustering which are expected to be just below 1% in amplitude .",
    "controlling all other possible sources of excess fluctuations well below that level requires a stable large - area detector ( to reduce photon counting noise ) and probably an x - ray monitor which images simultaneously the brightest sources in the field ."
