    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) quite well meet the requirements of a systematic study of supernova remnants ( snrs ) , in view of the facts concerning the known distance ( 50 kpc ; feast 1999 ) and the small absorption because it is the nearest face - on galaxy to us . over 30 snrs",
    "have been discovered in the lmc so far , and categorized @xcite .",
    "besides , due to the limited spatial resolution of previous observations , it is reported that only six of pulsar / snr associations in the lmc , psr b0540@xmath069 in n158a @xcite , psr j0537@xmath06910 in n157b @xcite , a pulsar in n206 @xcite , sgr 0526@xmath066 in n49 @xcite , xmmu j053559.3@xmath0673509 in dem l241 @xcite , and a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) in snr b0453@xmath068.5 @xcite . a pwn is a synchrotron emission from high pressure plasma swept by the pulsar s relativistic wind .",
    "even though all of pwne are powered by a pulsar , there is a case of a pwn without detection of a pulsar @xcite .",
    "the pulsar / snr or pwn / snr associations provide meaningful information , such as the age of the systems , and the type of remnants .",
    "the snr n23 ( 0506@xmath068.0 ) is one of the snrs in the lmc that @xcite identified as an snr with radio observations at 5 and 14.7 ghz for the first time .",
    "it is classified by its morphology as being a middle - aged ( @xmath103000 year ) and an irregular - shaped snr in @xcite .",
    "snr n23 has not been well studied , so there is still no absolute solution for its explosion type ( a core - collapse or a ia ) .",
    "@xcite insisted the possibility that n23 is a remnant from a massive star sn , since a co cloud with high - density ob stars was observed within @xmath1030 pc of n23 . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite suggested that the remnant does not have any association with others according to their own observations with better spatial resolutions than that of the cohen survey .",
    "we present the results of an x - ray observation of n23 with _",
    "chandra _ in this paper .",
    "the observation details are summarized in @xmath112 , and the analysis results in @xmath113 . using those results",
    ", we discuss the source discovered at the center of the remnant in @xmath114 , and @xmath115 is a summary of this paper . @xcite reported the same results based on their independent analysis .",
    "an observation of snr n23 was performed with the _ chandra _ @xcite acis - s detector @xcite on december 29 , 2002 ( observation i d = 2762 ) .",
    "the operation was in a timed exposure very faint mode , and it provided a time resolution of 3.24 sec .",
    "data reduction was done using _",
    "chandra _ interactive analysis of observation ( ciao ) version 3.1 and caldb version 2.28 . from the level 1",
    "processed events that _ chandra _ x - ray center gives , _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics _ ( _ asca _ ) grades of 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 were selected .",
    "after that , the data was filtered for good time intervals and , consequently , the total usable exposure time was 37 ksec .",
    "figure  [ fig : img ] shows acis x - ray images in the ( a ) 0.52.0 kev and ( b ) 2.08.0 kev bands .",
    "it demonstrates that the diffuse emission extend @xmath12 ( 15 pc @xmath7 19 pc for a distance of 50 kpc ) in the soft x - ray band .",
    "the eastern part of the snr is quite bright , whereas the northern and western parts are not .",
    "the lack of uniformity of the morphology might be due to a molecular cloud sitting southeast of n23 @xcite .    in the hard x - ray image , a compact source ( cxou j050552.3@xmath0680141 )",
    "is found in the snr , although diffuse emission is not .",
    "it was detected by the wavdetect command in ciao with a significance of 11 @xmath13 in the 2.0@xmath08.0 kev band .",
    "the contour of 3 @xmath13 detection has an elliptical shape ( 15 @xmath7 13 ) , and is slightly larger than the point spread function size at the source position of acis ; however , it can not be concluded that the source significantly extends , since there are non - uniform and complicated diffuse emissions over the source .",
    "its location was identified as r.a.= 05@xmath14523 , decl.=@xmath06801412 ( j2000 ) with an uncertainty of less than a pixel size ( 0.5 arcsec ) . no counterpart object in this position has been found with the simbad data base ; in addition , there is no report about the compact source in either optical @xcite or radio @xcite band observations .",
    "an optical and a radio limits are magnitude @xmath1 17 and @xmath2 @xmath102mjy respectively @xcite .",
    "we concentrate our discussion on this compact object in this paper , and call it `` source '' hereinafter .",
    "we obtained the spectrum of source with photons in the elliptical region at source , described in @xmath11[sec : imgana ] ( figure [ fig : img ] ( a ) ) .",
    "there were 285 and 37 events in the region in the 0.52.0 kev and 2.08.0 kev bands , respectively , and the corresponding count rates were 4.4 and 0.57 counts sec@xmath9 arcmin@xmath15 with an exposure time of 37 ksec .",
    "because the background of source surely consists of the thermal emission of snr itself , we tested three backgrounds : the first was a circle that included the whole snr ( bgd 1 ) , the second was a circle from an extraneous region ( bgd 2 ) , and the third was a circle that had almost the same surface brightness as the surrounding region of source ( bgd 3 ) , as shown in figure [ fig : img ] ( a ) .",
    "we fitted three spectra with an absorbed power - law function , blackbody model , and plasma ( mekal ) model @xcite , assuming that photons are absorbed in galaxy ( @xmath16 ) and the lmc ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the calculation of absorption columns was done using cross sections obtained by @xcite for @xmath16 and @xcite for @xmath18 , under the assumption that the abundances are 1 solar for @xmath16 @xcite and 0.3 solar for @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "we froze @xmath16 to 5.6 @xmath19 @xcite , while we left @xmath17 a free parameter .",
    "table [ tbl : fit_results ] gives the results of the fittings .",
    "even though we tested three models with three different background regions , it did not matter for the results of the absorption - corrected flux , @xmath20 ergs cm@xmath15 s @xmath9 .",
    "however , only the power - law fitting of the spectrum with the bgd 1 gave an acceptable reduced @xmath22 .",
    "figure [ fig : spec ] represents the best - fit power - law model and data with bgd 1 .      coherent pulsations of source were searched . selected photons are from the region of source ( see @xmath11[sec : specana ] ) and in the 2.08.0 kev band .",
    "the arrival times of photons were corrected with the axbary command in ciao .",
    "figure  [ fig : powspec ] gives a power - density spectrum of source made based on a fast fourier transform ( fft ) algorithm .",
    "even the highest peak dose not protrude significantly from the white noise ; thus , we consider that no significant pulsation was detected .",
    "note that the time resolution of acis is only 3.24 sec in this observation .",
    "we also searched for the time variability of source .",
    "we made a light curve of the entire observation time , as demonstrated in figure  [ fig : lc ] . a statistical analysis with the kolmogorov - smirnov test shows 53% for the probability of its constancy . as a result",
    ", we have concluded that source has no significant time variability .",
    "although a physical association between source and the snr n23 is strongly supported by the fact that the source location is almost at the center of the snr , our fitting results of the @xmath23 do not determine whether source is in lmc or not due to the error .",
    "we thus verified the case that source is ( 1 ) an object in galaxy , ( 2 ) the object in lmc is unrelated with snr , ( 3 ) a background active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , ( 4 ) the stellar remnant of n23 .",
    "if source is in galaxy , possible candidates are an active rs cvn binary ( @xmath24=29@xmath032 ) , a cataclysmic variables ( cv ; @xmath24=30@xmath033 ) , a young stellar object ( yso ; @xmath24=29@xmath031 ) , or a low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ; @xmath2530@xmath039 ) , because their luminosities are consistent with the source luminosity , assuming that source is in galaxy .",
    "since plasma models with any of three backgrounds did not provide an acceptable reduced @xmath22 , we concluded that source is unlikely to be a rs cvn , a cv , or a yso , which are well explained by plasma models .",
    "the emission from a lmxb can explained by a power - law model , but the photon index is typically 12 @xcite , which is harder than the best - fit power - law model of source .    as a result",
    ", we can say that source would not be a considerable object in the case that source is in galaxy .",
    "if source is in the lmc and unrelated with the snr , it could be a hmxb .",
    "the luminosity of hmxb ( log@xmath26 = 3338 ; muno et al .",
    "2003 ) corresponds to the luminosity of source , if source is in the lmc .",
    "the observed spectrum of a hmxb is explained with a photon index of 0.52.5 @xcite , which is also the same as the best - fit power - law of source .",
    "however , the hmxb should be observed with the companion star in the optical band , and the expected optical limit of the companion star in the lmc is magnitude 16 .",
    "the work by @xcite using the data of the macho project indicates that the optical limit in the source region is @xmath1 17 .",
    "we can thus reject the possibility of being a hmxb in lmc .",
    "the spectrum of an agn has a photon index of @xmath1013 @xcite , and the photon index of source is in between .",
    "we calculated the expected number of agns in the back of n23 using a log_n_@xmath0log_s _ function measured by the _",
    "deep survey in the lockman hole @xcite . as a result , 24 agns ,",
    "the flux of which is equal or higher than source , are spread per square degree in the sky .",
    "then , because the possibility of the agn coincidence in the snr region ( elliptical ; @xmath27 ) is only 0.8% , we can hardly find an agn in the back of n23 .",
    "it is highly possible that source associates with the snr due to its location .",
    "the existence of an associating stellar remnant suggests that n23 is outcome of gravitational core - collapse of a massive star .",
    "the possible candidates for source as a stellar remnant of n23 would be a neutron star , a compact central object ( cco ) , an isolated pulsar , or a pwn .",
    "the emission by a neutron star can be explained by a blackbody model with @xmath28 = 0.150.25 kev @xcite , but the blackbody model was not able to represent the source radiation with any backgrounds .",
    "thus , source is hardly said to be a usual neutron star .",
    "ccos have recently been discovered in several snrs , like the central source in cassiopeia a @xcite or in puppis a @xcite .",
    "ccos spectra can be fitted with either a blackbody or a power - law model , but the blackbody temperatures of ccos are excessively high ( @xmath28 = @xmath100.30.6 kev ; chakrabarty et al .",
    "2001 , kaspi & roberts 2004 ) to consider that they are the usual neutron stars ; also , the photon indices of power - law fitting is too soft ( @xmath4 = @xmath102.64.1 ; kaspi & roberts 2004 ) to be pulsars .",
    "the luminosity of ccos is log_l_@xmath29 = 3135 ergs s@xmath9 , as shown by the triangle symbols in figure  [ fig : pi_lum ] .",
    "even though the source luminosity is consistent with those of ccos , source could not be acceptably fitted with a blackbody model , and the photon index of a power - law model is harder than the typical photon index of ccos .",
    "thus , we consider that source in n23 seems not to be a cco .",
    "a pulsar typically has the power - law spectrum with a photon index of @xmath4 = @xmath100.61.9 @xcite , which is harder than the best - fit photon index of source .",
    "meanwhile , for a pwn , we would observe a softer photon index , generically , @xmath4 = @xmath101.12.3 @xcite .",
    "the luminosity of the pwn is log@xmath26 = 2937 , which is brighter than that of only the pulsar @xcite .",
    "this is indicated in figure  [ fig : pi_lum ] by circle symbols . due to the spectrum agreement ,",
    "source likely included the emission from a pwn . in this case",
    ", source would be a rotation - powered pulsar plus a pwn , or a pwn powered by an unseen pulsar .",
    "for any conclusion , the pulsation searches with the better time resolution are required .",
    "there is no counterpart of source in the atca radio observation ( 1380 , 2387 , 4790 , and 8640 mhz @xcite ) , and the flux limit was estimated as @xmath102 mjy in any of four frequencies .",
    "source is quite similar to the radio - quiet pwn around psr b1509@xmath058 , which flux in the x - ray band is factor of 2 lagrer than source and the radio flux limit is @xmath101.3 mjy @xcite .",
    "therefore , the radio limit is consistent with our conclusion that source is a radio - quiet pwn .",
    "a detailed analysis of the compact source at the center of snr n23 in the lmc with _",
    "chandra _ has been presented .",
    "n23 has @xmath30 diffuse emission in the @xmath2 2 kev band , and an almost point - like compact source in the @xmath1 2 kev band .",
    "this source ( cxou j050552.3@xmath0680141 ) has no counterpart at any other wavelength .",
    "the spectrum of the source can be fitted to a power - law function with @xmath4 = 2.2 @xmath5 , and a luminosity of 1.0 @xmath7 10@xmath8 ergs s@xmath9 in the 0.510 kev band for a distance of 50 kpc .",
    "neither significant pulsation nor time variability was detected with the time resolution of 3.2 sec observation .",
    "the results of the fittings indicate that the source might well be a rotation - powered pulsar and/or a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) associating with the snr .",
    "it implies that the progenitor of the remnant is likely to be a massive star .",
