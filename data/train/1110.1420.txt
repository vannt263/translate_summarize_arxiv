    "in recent years , much effort has been made to establish the statistical connection between galaxies and dark matter halos , as parameterized via the conditional luminosity function ( clf ) ( yang , mo & van den bosch 2003 ) or the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) ( jing et al .",

    "this galaxy - dark matter connection describes how galaxies with different properties occupy halos of different mass , and yields important insight into how galaxies form and evolve in dark matter halos . in practice ,",
    "the various methods that have been used to constrain the galaxy - dark matter connection ( galaxy clustering , galaxy - galaxy lensing , galaxy group catalogues , abundance matching , satellite kinematics ) use the fact that the halo properties , such as mass function , mass profile , and clustering , are well understood in the current @xmath4cdm model of structure formation ( e.g. , mo , van den bosch & white 2010 ) .    at low - redshift , large redshift surveys , such as the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; colless et al .",

    "all these results have been used to infer how galaxies with different properties are distributed in halos of different masses ( e.g. jing et al .",

    "in addition , these large galaxy redshift surveys can also be used to identify galaxy systems ( groups ) , defined as those galaxies that share a common dark matter host halo ( yang et al . 2005a ; 2007 ) .",
    "such group catalogs can be used to examine the halo - galaxy connection even more directly than the methods mentioned above ( e.g. , eke et al .",
    "2004 ; yang et al .  2005b , 2008 , 2009b ) .",
    "these analyses have revealed a number of important properties regarding the relation between galaxies and their dark matter halos .",
    "the stellar mass to halo mass ratio has a minimum for halos of @xmath17 , and increases rapidly towards both lower and higher halo masses ( yang et al .",
    "2003 , 2005b , 2008 , 2009b ; van den bosch et al . 2003a ; tinker et al .  2005 ; leauthaud et al .",
    "2012 ) , suggesting that galaxy formation is most efficient in halos with a present - day mass of @xmath18 , i.e. , these halos have the highest integrated star formation efficiencies .",
    "yet , their total stellar masses are only a few percent of that of the halo , indicating that the overall star formation efficiency is very low .",
    "ideally , we would like to carry out similar analyses at various redshifts , so as to investigate how star formation proceeds and how galaxies assemble as their host halos grow within the cosmic density field .",
    "such analyses are now becoming possible at intermediate redshift , @xmath19 , where reliable luminosity and stellar mass functions of galaxies have been obtained from various redshift surveys , such as the deep2 survey ( davis et al .",
    "2003 ) , the combo-17 survey ( wolf et al .",
    "2004 ) , vvds ( le fevre et al .",
    "2005 ) , and zcosmos ( lilly et al .",
    "in addition , these surveys have been used to measure the 2pcfs of galaxies as function of their luminosity , stellar mass and/or color ( e.g. , daddi et al .",

    "2011 ; wake et al .",
    "2011 ) .    with the advent of deep , multi wave - band surveys , it has even become possible to estimate the luminosity / stellar mass functions of galaxies out to @xmath21 ( e.g. drory et al .",
    "2005 ; fontana et al .  2006 ;",
    "perez - gonzalez et al .  2008 ; marchesini et al .",
    "2009 ; stark et al .",
    "2009 ; bouwens et al .",
    "however , the data samples are still small ( and hence subject to cosmic variance ) , with large discrepancies among different measurements ( see marchesini et al .",
    "2009 ) . furthermore ,",
    "since reliable clustering measurements are in general unavailable for these high redshift galaxy samples , it is not possible to carry out the same hod / clf analyses for these high-@xmath3 galaxies as for galaxies at low @xmath3 .",
    "nevertheless , attempts have been made to establish the relation between galaxies and their dark matter halos out to high @xmath3 using a technique known as abundance matching , in which galaxies of a given luminosity or stellar mass are linked to dark matter halos of given mass by matching the observed abundance of the galaxies in question to the halo abundance obtained from the halo mass function ( typically also accounting for subhalos ) .",
    "this approach was first used by mo & fukugita ( 1996 ) and mo , mao & white ( 1999 ) to model the number density and clustering of lyman - break galaxies .",
    "more recently , several studies have used abundance matching techniques to probe the galaxy - dark matter connection out to @xmath22 ( e.g. , vale & ostriker 2004 , 2006 ; conroy , wechsler & kravtsov 2006 ; shankar et al .  2006 ;",
    "conroy & wechsler 2009 ; moster et al .",
    "2010 ; guo et al .  2010",
    "; behroozi , conroy & weschler 2010 ) .",
    "an important aspect of abundance matching is the treatment of dark matter subhalos .",
    "it is usually assumed that a central galaxy resides at the center of each halo , and orbiting around it are satellite galaxies associated with the subhalos of the host halo .",
    "these subhalos were distinctive ( host ) halos themselves before they were accreted into their hosts , namely satellite galaxies were themselves central galaxies before their host halo became a subhalo .",
    "the modeling of the total galaxy population can therefore be separated into two parts : ( i ) the formation of central galaxies in dark matter halos at different redshifts , and ( ii ) the accretion and evolution of satellite galaxies in their host halos . with the use of high - resolution numerical simulations and extended press - schechter theory ( bond et al .",
    "1991 ; lacey & cole 1993 ) , the properties of the subhalo population have now been determined with great accuracy ( e.g. gao et al .",
    "2004 ; de lucia et al .  2004 ; tormen et al .",
    "2004 ; van den bosch et al .  2005a",
    "; weller et al .  2005 ; diemand et al .  2007 ;",
    "giocoli et al .",
    "2008 ; li & mo 2009 ) .",
    "if satellite galaxies are indeed associated with subhalos , these properties should be relevant to the modeling of the galaxy population .",
    "in particular , since subhalos were host halos before accretion , the subhalo property that seems most relevant is its mass _ at the time of accretion_. consequently , many abundance matching studies to date have linked galaxies of property @xmath23 ( i.e. , galaxy luminosity or stellar mass ) to dark matter ( sub)-halos of mass @xmath24 using @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the comoving number density of galaxies of property @xmath23 at redshift @xmath3 , @xmath27 is the halo mass function at redshift @xmath3 , and @xmath28 is the comoving number density of subhaloes identified at redshift @xmath3 which at accretion have a mass @xmath29 .",
    "hence , in such abundance matching the property of a satellite galaxy is assumed to depend only on its halo mass at accretion .    although subhalo abundance matching yields galaxy correlation functions that are in remarkably good agreement with observations ( e.g. , conroy et al .",
    "2006 ; guo et al .",
    "2010 ; wang & jing 2010 ) , it implies a particular path for the evolution of satellite galaxies .",
    "indeed , assuming that the stellar masses of satellite galaxies depend only on their halo mass at accretion implies either that the relation between @xmath23 and halo mass @xmath24 is independent of the time when the subhalo is accreted , and the evolution after accretion is independent of the host halo into which the subhalo has been accreted and how long ago it has been accreted , or that the effects of different accretion times and subsequent evolutions in different hosts conspire to give a stellar mass that depends only on the mass of the subhalo at accretion .",
    "such evolution of satellites is neither physically motivated nor the only possible path which satellite galaxies could take .",
    "in fact , applying the abundance matching technique as described above to data at different @xmath3 results in a @xmath30 relation that changes with redshift ( e.g. , conroy et al .  2006 ;",
    "conroy & wechsler 2009 ; moster et al .",
    "2010 ; wang & jing 2010 ) .",
    "if one accepts that @xmath23 for central galaxies depends on both @xmath24 and @xmath3 , then the properties of satellite galaxies do not just depend on the host halo mass at accretion , @xmath29 , but also on the accretion redshift , @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , after accretion a satellite galaxy may lose or gain stellar mass and even be disrupted due to tidal stripping and disruption , such that @xmath23 of satellite galaxies may depend on other properties in addition to both @xmath29 and @xmath31 .",
    "so far these effects have not been modeled in any detail in abundance - matching studies .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a new , self - consistent approach to model the relation between galaxies and dark matter halos over cosmic time .",
    "our approach is based on the model of yang et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , which gives subhalo abundance as a function of both mass at accretion and accretion time .",
    "this allows us to use a galaxy - halo relation that depends on subhalo accretion time and to follow the dynamical evolution after their accretion .",
    "furthermore , since satellites observed in halos ( galaxy systems ) at the present time are ` fossil records ' of both the formation of central galaxies at high-@xmath3 and the subsequent dynamical evolution , the observed abundance and clustering of satellite galaxies at the present time can be used to constrain the galaxy - halo relations at different redshifts . in the present work , we use our model together with various observational data to obtain the stellar mass - halo mass relation as a function of redshift from @xmath0 to the present .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : halomodel ]",
    "we outline the halo model ingredients to be used . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we describe how we model the stellar mass function , the conditional stellar mass function , and the two point correlation function of galaxies .",
    "the observational constraints used for our analysis are presented in section  [ sec : observation ] .",
    "the results are presented in section  [ sec : res ] , while section  [ sec : evolve ] describes the implications regarding the assembly of galaxies and the evolution of the galaxy dark matter connection .",
    "we summarize our results in section  [ sec : summary ] , which also includes a detailed discussion regarding various implications for galaxy formation and evolution .    throughout this paper",
    "we will mostly focus on a @xmath4cdm ` concordance ' cosmology whose parameters are consistent with the seventh - year data release of the wmap mission ( komatsu et al .",
    "2011 ; hereafter wmap7 ) .",
    "however , in order to investigate the possible cosmology dependence of our results , we also present results for the following set of @xmath4cdm cosmologies : wmap1 , with parameters consistent with the first - year data release of the wmap mission ( spergel et al .  2003 ) ; wmap3 , with parameters given in spergel et al .",

    "however , since the shmf given by eq .",

    "the stellar masses of these massive galaxies have increased little during the later growth of their host halos , indicating that star formation in these galaxies must have ceased at early times , and that they have not cannibalized too many ( massive ) satellites .    for low - mass halos , especially those with @xmath499 ,",
    "there is a huge increase in the stellar mass for a given halo mass from @xmath500 to @xmath501 .",

    "although it is standard practice to invoke supernova feedback as a feedback mechanism to suppress star formation in low mass haloes , this process is not expected to be very efficient in haloes with @xmath503 ( e.g. , dekel & silk 1986 ) , and it appears that additional mechanisms are required to explain the low inferred star formation efficiencies at high-@xmath3 .",
    "alternatively , one might question whether the data for faint galaxies is sufficiently reliable .",

    "such large discrepancies are difficult to be explained by observational uncertainties .",

    "the median , _ total _ stellar mass of surviving satellite galaxies in the main branch can be obtained by integrating the csmf of satellite galaxies : @xmath524 thus , once we know the assembly history of a dark matter halo , it is straightforward to use our model to obtain the corresponding assembly histories of the stellar components of its central and satellite galaxies .",

    "the total satellite mass in a massive halo continues to grow all the way to the present time , whereas the central galaxy ceases to grow once the halo mass reaches @xmath11 . as shown by the magenta , dot - dashed lines , the use of smf2 predicts higher satellite masses at high-@xmath3 than the use of smf1 , especially in low - mass halos .",

    "however , the total accreted stellar masses are significantly larger than those in the surviving satellite population , especially at low redshift ( @xmath561 ) .",
    "this is more clearly seen in the bottom rows of fig .",
    "[ fig : merger ] and  [ fig : ratios ] , which show the differences between the median accreted mass and the median mass of the surviving satellites .",
    "this indicates that in massive halos a significant fraction of the total stellar mass brought in by subhalos is actually not associated with surviving satellite galaxies and must exist in other forms . for convenience",

    "there are two possible fates for the disrupted component : either it is accreted by the central galaxy or it gives rise to a population of halo stars ( also referred to as intracluster stars , or ics , in the case of massive halos ) . unfortunately",
    ", our model can not uniquely discriminate between these two components , as the mass of the central galaxy can also grow through star formation .",
    "however , we can obtain important constraints by comparing the growth of the disrupted component to that of the central galaxies ( black , dashed lines ) .",
    "this shows that central galaxies in halos with @xmath562 must have grown mainly through _ in situ _ star formation , simply because the total mass in the disrupted component is much smaller than that of the central . for more massive halos",

    "the total stellar mass in the disrupted component is actually larger than that of the central galaxy .",

    "2007 ) . as one can see from the left two panels in the bottom row of fig .",
    "[ fig : merger ] , although the total mass of the disrupted fraction is sufficient to form the central galaxy in massive halos , in reality central galaxies in these halos must have acquired their stellar mass mainly through _ in situ _ star formation , rather than through the accretion of satellites ( see also results along this line obtained from hydro - dynamical simulations by e.g. , naab et al . 2009 ; oser et al . 2010 ; 2012 ; hrischmann et al .",
    "this can be inferred from the fact that these central galaxies have already build up most of their stellar mass at high redshifts , when the mass in the disrupted component is too small to make a dominant contribution .",
    "accretion can only be significant at @xmath16 in massive halos , when the disrupted component is sufficiently massive compared to the mass of the central .",
    "however , at these low redshifts , the central galaxies in these massive halos no longer seem to grow much in stellar mass .",
    "hence , even central galaxies in massive halos must have mainly grown via _ in situ _ star formation .    finally , we point out that the use of smf2 leads to masses in the disrupted component that are quite similar to those obtained using smf1 .",
    "the higher total accreted mass predicted with smf2 for low - mass halos at high-@xmath3 is largely due to the higher mass in the survived satellites .",

    "[ fig : merger ] and  [ fig : ratios ] ) .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that small progenitors are not well resolved in the simulation at high-@xmath3 ( see the top - right panel of fig .  [",

    "the projected 2pcfs on large scales decrease with both increasing redshift and decreasing stellar mass .",
    "note that the differences among the different models are extremely small at large scale ( @xmath568 ) . on small scales",
    "our models predict that the 2pcfs are greatly enhanced relative to a simple extrapolation from large scales , except for the fit0 models which has zero satellites , and therefore no one - halo term .",
    "note that this enhancement is stronger for more massive galaxies , and that it is fairly different for the different models .",

    "in this paper we have developed a new and self - consistent model that describes the galaxy - dark matter connection over cosmic history . unlike the popular abundance matching technique ,",
    "our model takes account of the fact that sub - halos in a host halo are accreted at different times , so that the stellar masses associated with them are likely to depend on both their halo masses at accretion and their accretion times .",
    "in addition , our model allows for dynamical evolution of the satellite population ( mass stripping , tidal disruption , cannibalism ) .",
    "we have used galaxy stellar mass functions observed in the redshift range @xmath569 , together with the conditional stellar mass function and two - point correlation functions ( both at @xmath570 , and both obtained from sdss ) , to constrain the evolution of the galaxy - dark matter connection from @xmath571 to the present .",
    "the relation between halo mass and stellar mass thus obtained is used , together with simulated and theoretical halo assembly histories , to predict how the masses of different stellar components in dark matter halos ( central galaxies , satellite galaxies , and halo stars ) evolve as function of time .",

    "the ratio @xmath7 reveals a maximum of @xmath8 at a halo mass @xmath572 .",
    "the fact that this maximum value is much lower than the universal baryon fraction ( @xmath10 ) reflects the overall inefficiency of star formation . at higher redshifts",
    "the maximum in @xmath7 remains close to @xmath8 , but shifts to higher halo mass ( see also wake et al .",
    "the @xmath14-@xmath24 relations obtained here are roughly in agreement with previous studies ( e.g. , moster et al .",
    "2010 ; wang & jing 2010 ; leauthaud et al .",
    ". however , our model allows us to put constraints on the satellite population so that we can interpret the results in terms of the evolution of galaxies in dark halos .",
    "we find that low - mass satellite galaxies can significantly increase their stellar masses after accretions by their host halos .",
    "the time - scale for the disruption of satellite galaxies is about the same as the dynamical friction time scale of their subhalos obtained in @xmath63-body simulations , suggesting that most disruption occurs once the galaxy has ` depleted ' its orbital energy , at which point it is either accreted by the central galaxy or torn apart by the strong tidal field .",
    "the stellar mass assembly history for central galaxies is completely decoupled from the assembly history of its host halo .",
    "initially the ratio @xmath7 increases rapidly with time , until the halo mass reaches @xmath11 , at which point @xmath12 .",
    "once @xmath573 , there is little growth in @xmath14 , causing the ratio @xmath7 to decline .",
    "most massive centrals assemble their stellar mass earlier than their less massive counterparts , even though their host haloes assemble later . in milky - way sized halos more than half of the central stellar mass is assembled at @xmath574 , while brightest cluster galaxies had already grown to half their present day stellar mass by @xmath575 .",
    "the accretion of satellite galaxies contributes little to the formation of central galaxies in small halos .",
    "hence , most of their stars must have formed _ in situ _ so that their assembly histories closely resemble their star formation histories . in massive halos",
    "more than a half of the stellar mass of the central galaxy has to be formed _ in situ _ at @xmath576 .",

    "2010 ) . on small scales",
    ", however , the 2pcfs provides important constraint on how satellite galaxies evolve within dark matter halos .",
    "future observations of the small scale clustering strength of galaxies at high-@xmath3 will therefore be important for our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "our models predict that the high-@xmath3 2pcfs on small scales are much steeper than at low-@xmath3 , especially for more massive galaxies .",
    "these results have important implications for our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution . here",
    "we highlight a few issues which we believe to be particularly interesting .",
    "one of the implications of our results is that star formation in low mass halos at high-@xmath3 must be extremely ineffecient .",
    "this basically follows from the strong evolution in the @xmath14-@xmath24 relation that we infer between high-@xmath3 and the present at the low mass end : halos of @xmath578 host central galaxies at @xmath0 that are orders of magnitude less massive than centrals in halos of the same mass at @xmath197 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : highz_mm ] ) . note that even at @xmath197 central galaxies in halos with @xmath579 have a stellar mass that is only 2 - 3 percent of the universal baryon fraction .",
    "hence , only a minute fraction of the baryons associated with low mass halos at high-@xmath3 are turned into stars .",
    "it is typically assumed that star formation is suppressed in low - mass halos due to supernova feedback and/or photo - ionization .",
    "however , it has become clear in recent years that either the standard treatment of these processes is inadequate , or that additional mechanisms are needed to help suppress star formation in low mass halos . in particular , recent observations have indicated that the specific star formation rates ( ssfrs ) of star forming galaxies , at fixed stellar mass , increase with redshift from @xmath197 until they reach a plateau at @xmath580 ( see e.g. , stark et al .  2009 ;",
    "labb et al 2010a , b ; gonzlez et al .",
    "2010 ) . as pointed out by several studies ,",
    "this constancy of the ssfrs is inconsistent with predictions of ` standard ' models for galaxy formation , which instead predict ssfrs that continue to increase with redshift ( lo faro et al .",
    "2009 ; dutton , van den bosch & dekel 2010 ; bouche et al .",
    "2010 ; firmani & avila - reese 2010 ; weinmann , neistein & dekel 2011 ; lacey et al .",
    "2011 ) . simply increasing the supernova feedback efficiency in order to lower the star formation rates at high-@xmath3",
    "is not a solution , because it has no impact on the ssfrs , as it changes both the sfr _ and _ the stellar mass ( dutton et al .",
    "2010 ; bouche et al .",
    "in addition , it will result in too little stellar mass at low and intermediate redshifts , not to mention the fact that the supernova feedback efficiencies that are typically invoked are already unrealistically high ( e.g. , benson et al .",
    "2003 ) . what seems to be needed instead",
    "is a modification of the ` standard ' model that ( i ) causes a larger suppression of star formation in low mass halos at high-@xmath3 , and ( ii ) a boost in star formation at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath581 ) .",
    "although there has been no shortage of ideas ( e.g. , mo et al .",
    "2005 ; lo faro et al .  2009 ;",
    "bouche et al .",
    "2010 ; lacey et al .  2011 ; krumholz & dekel 2011 ; weinmann , neistein & dekel 2011 ; wang , weinmann & neistein 2011 ; avila - reese et al .",
    "2011 ) , it is clear that much more work is required before this outstanding problem in galaxy formation and evolution is adequately addressed . we believe that our constraints on the stellar assembly histories of ( central ) galaxies may play an important role in testing and calibrating these new models . in particular , the rapid increase in @xmath7 at high-@xmath3 ( before the host halo reaches a mass @xmath582 ) indicates that the specific star formation rate of ( central ) galaxies is much higher than the specific growth rate of its dark matter halo , which may hold important clues .",
    "another intriguing feature from the stellar mass assembly histories is the fact that @xmath7 reaches a maximum of @xmath8 once @xmath24 reaches a mass of @xmath583 .",
    "this feature seems to hold independent of the final host halo mass of the central galaxy .",
    "since , as we have shown , the stellar mass growth in host halos with @xmath584 is dominated by _ in situ _ star formation ( rather than accretion ) , this suggests that something quenches star formation in central galaxies once its halo mass reaches @xmath585 .",
    "interestingly , this mass scale is very similar to the cold - mode to hot - mode transition scale ( birnboim & dekel 2003 ; kere et al .",
    "2005 ) , suggesting that the quenching of central galaxies coincides with the formation of a hot gaseous halo .",
    "this is indeed what seems to be required in order to explain the observed bimodality in colors and/or specific star formation rates of the galaxy population ( e.g. , cattaneo et al .",
    "2006 ; birnboim et al .",
    "different mechanisms have been invoked to explain why this transition is associated with a shutdown of star formation in the central galaxies , ranging from agn feedback ( e.g. , tabor & binney 1993 ; ciotti & ostriker 1997 ; croton et al .",
    "2006 ; bower et al .  2006",
    "; hopkins et al .  2006 ) and gravitational heating ( e.g. , fabian 2003 ; khochfar & ostriker 2008 ; dekel & birnboim 2008 ; birnboim & dekel 2011 ) to thermal conduction ( e.g. , kim & narayan 2003 ) and turbulence ( e.g. , zhu , feng & fang 2011 ) .",
    "although our results are unable to provide direct insight into the exact quenching mechanism , it is fascinating ( or at least reassuring ) that our analysis , which uses no ( direct ) data on star formation rates or the color - bimodality of the galaxy population , also comes to the conclusion that galaxies are quenched once their halo mass reaches @xmath18 .",
    "another important result regards the implied build - up of stellar halos .",
    "we have argued in section  [ sec : sf ] that central galaxies build up the vast majority of their stellar mass via _ in situ _ star formation ( the only possible exception are the most massive centrals , which may have build up as much as roughly half their stellar mass via accretion ) .",
    "this implies that the difference between the total mass in accreted satellites and surviving satellites , what we called the `` disrupted '' component in section  [ sec : sf ] , must have given rise to a stellar halo .",
    "this result is consistent with a number of recent studies which have argued that reconciling halo occupation statistics with halo merger rates requires that a significant fraction of satellite galaxies is indeed tidally disrupted ( e.g. , conroy , ho & white 2007 ; conroy , wechsler & kravtsov 2007 ; kang & van den bosch 2008 ; yang , mo & van den bosch 2009a ) .",
    "as these studies have argued , satellite disruption is an important ingredient of galaxy formation , which has hitherto been largely ignored in semi - analytical models . properly accounting for satellite disruption may alleviate the problem with the excessive growth of massive galaxies",
    "( e.g. , monaco et al .",
    "2006 ; conroy , wechsler & kravtsov 2007 , brown et al .",
    "2008 ) , with the overabundance of satellite galaxies in the semi - analytical models ( liu et al .",
    "2010 ) , and may even be important for understanding the observed metallicities of satellite galaxies ( pasquali et al .",
    "note that our model predicts that the fraction of stars associated with the stellar halo is an increasing function of halo mass ( see also purcell , bullock & zentner 2007 and henriques , bertone & thomas 2008 ) , in qualitative agreement with observations ( gonzalez , zaritsky & zabludoff 2007 ) .",
    "finally we point out that our results may have important implications for the ` missing satellite problem ' , which refers to the fact that the predicted subhalo count in a milky - way ( mw ) sized halo vastly exceeds the number of observed satellite galaxies in the mw ( moore et al .",
    "1999 ; klypin et al .",
    "1999 ) . although theoretical progress combined with the discovery of a large population of new ( typically ultra - faint ) satellite galaxies in the milky way ( e.g. , belokurov et al .",
    "2007 ) has at least partially alleviated this concern about a mismatch between the numbers of low - mass subhalos and faint mw satellites , it has become clear that it is difficult to reconcile the observed abundance of satellite galaxies with their kinematics : whereas the line - of - sight velocity dispersions of the satellites suggest that they reside in subhalos of relatively low mass , their abundance suggests they reside in much more massive subhalos ( e.g. , madau , diemand & kuhlen 2008 ; boylan - kolchin , bullock & kaplinghat 2011 ) .",
    "this problem is particularly acute if one uses subhalo abundance matching techniques to link satellite galaxies to subhalos ( e.g. , boylan - kolchin et al .",
    "2011 , see also busha et al .",
    "as we have argued , subhalo abundance matching is not self - consistent in that it does not account for dependence on subhalo accretion times .",
    "since our model shows that there is very strong redshift dependence in the @xmath14-@xmath24 relation at the low mass end , with low mass halos at higher @xmath3 hosting central galaxies that are much less massive , the large scatter in subhalo accretion times implies a huge amount of scatter in the ratio between the stellar mass of satellite galaxies and their halo mass at infall .",
    "such a large scatter may be exactly what is needed to reconcile the observed satellite population of the mw with predictions from @xmath4cdm cosmologies ( e.g , .",
    ", madau et al .  2008 ) , and may already have observational support from the fact that the ultrafaint dwarfs appear to reside in halos of similar mass as the much more massive ` classical ' dwarfs ( strigari et al .  2008 ; walker et al .  2009 ) .",

    "we therefore also construct another set of samples as follows : for each of the five stellar mass bins , we first find the maximum number density of galaxies ( at some redshift ) . next we determine the minimum and maximum redshifts at which the number density of galaxies ( in that stellar mass bin ) drops to _ half _ of the maximum value .",
    "only galaxies within these two redshift limits are kept in the sample . in what follows",
    "we refer to the five samples thus selected as ` volume1 ' samples , and the corresponding number densities as function of redshift are shown as the shaded areas in the upper right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : redshift ] .    since the sdss galaxy sample is flux limited , red and blue galaxies of the same stellar mass suffer from different selection effects because of their different stellar mass - to - light ratios .",
    "using conservative limits , van den bosch et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have shown that the stellar mass completeness limit as a function of redshift for the sdss catalogue is given by @xmath595 = { 4.852 + 2.246 \\log d_l(z ) +    1.123 \\log(1+z ) - 1.186 z \\over 1 - 0.067 z } \\,.\\ ] ] using this limit we also construct five samples in stellar mass that are ` complete ' .",

    "[ fig : redshift ] , while the shaded areas in the lower right - hand panel indicate the corresponding number densities as function of redshift . in what follows",
    "we refer to these five samples as ` volume2 ' samples .",
    "to estimate the two - point correlation functions , one needs to construct random samples to normalize the galaxy - pair counts ( see below ) . in order to take account of the overall selection effects in the sdss catalogue ,",
    "we first construct a random sample using the sdss luminosity function and then apply various observational selection effects ( magnitude limits , redshift completeness , sky boundary ) according to the sdss survey mask .",
    "since galaxies in different stellar mass bin do not follow the overall luminosity function , we re - assign a redshift to each mock galaxy by randomly sampling the redshifts of the sdss galaxies in the corresponding stellar mass bin .",

    "<S> we present a new model to describe the galaxy - dark matter connection across cosmic time , which unlike the popular subhalo abundance matching technique is self - consistent in that it takes account of the facts that ( i ) subhalos are accreted at different times , and ( ii ) the properties of satellite galaxies may evolve after accretion . using observations of galaxy stellar mass functions out to @xmath0 , the conditional stellar mass function at @xmath1 obtained from sdss galaxy group catalogues , and the two - point correlation function ( 2pcf ) of galaxies at @xmath2 as function of stellar mass , we constrain the relation between galaxies and dark matter halos over the entire cosmic history from @xmath0 to the present . </S>",
    "<S> this relation is then used to predict the median assembly histories of different stellar mass components within dark matter halos ( central galaxies , satellite galaxies , and halo stars ) . </S>",

    "<S> our main findings are the following : ( i ) our model reasonably fits all data within the observational uncertainties , indicating that the @xmath4cdm concordance cosmology is consistent with a wide variety of data regarding the galaxy population across cosmic time . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) at low-@xmath3 , the stellar mass of central galaxies increases with halo mass as @xmath5 and @xmath6 at the massive and low - mass ends , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> the maximum in @xmath7 remains close to @xmath8 , but shifts to higher halo mass . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) the inferred time - scale for the disruption of satellite galaxies is about the same as the dynamical friction time scale of their subhalos . </S>",
    "<S> ( iv ) the stellar mass assembly history of central galaxies is completely decoupled from the assembly history of its host halo ; the ratio @xmath7 initially increases rapidly with time until the halo mass reaches @xmath11 , at which point @xmath12 . </S>",

    "<S> ( v ) in low mass halos , the accretion of satellite galaxies contributes little to the formation of their central galaxies , indicating that most of their stars must have formed _ in situ_. in massive halos more than half of the stellar mass of the central galaxy has to be formed _ in situ _ , and the accretion of satellites can only become significant at @xmath16 . ( </S>",
    "<S> vi ) the total mass in halo stars is more than twice that of the central galaxy in massive halos , but less than 10 percent of @xmath14 in milky way sized halos . </S>",
    "<S> ( vii ) the 2pcfs of galaxies on small scales holds important information regarding the evolution of satellite galaxies , and at high-@xmath3 is predicted to be much steeper than at low-@xmath3 , especially for more massive galaxies . </S>",
