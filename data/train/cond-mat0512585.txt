    "the effect of disorder has been shown to be crucial for many essential properties of magnetic materials .",
    "however , investigations involving statistical disorder are always faced with lots of technical difficulties , especially in a parameter regime that is not accessible to perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "the introduction and application of the coherent potential approximation(cpa ) , which is initially developed by soven@xcite and taylor@xcite , has increased greatly our understanding of disordered systems , particularly of random , substitutional disordered alloys . in the cpa",
    ", one assumes that the real , disordered material is replaced by a translationally invariant effective medium .",
    "this is fixed by imposing the self - consistent condition that the scattering off of a real atom embedded in the medium vanishes on the average .",
    "the cpa provides reliable results in various situations studying excitations like electrons , phonons , magnons , etc@xcite . in recent years ,",
    "cpa combined with some _ ab initio _ method has been shown to be crucial tool for the understanding of diluted magnetic semiconductors(dms)@xcite .    for spin systems with substitutional disorder ,",
    "the problem more generally considered is a binary system@xcite in which the magnetic atoms of each component ( a or b ) with spin @xmath0 or @xmath1 are randomly distributed over the @xmath2 sites of a regular lattice with concentrations @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , respectively . in the present work ,",
    "the interaction between spins is described by the heisenberg - type hamiltonian in which exchange constants are @xmath6 according to the two interacting spins at site @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "using tyablikov decoupling approximation to the retarded magnon green s function of a heisenberg - type hamiltonian , we can achieve the equation of motion for green s function involving three kinds of disorder that depend explicitly on site spin ( _ diagonal disorder _ ) , the exchange parameters ( _ off - diagonal disorder _ ) and an environmental term given by the static field induced at one site by the presence of neighboring spins ( _ environmental disorder _ ) . we will deal with _ diagonal disorder _ and _ off - diagonal disorder _",
    "terms in the beb - cpa framework .",
    "the beb theory by blackman , esterling and berk@xcite extends the cpa which studies systems only with _ diagonal disorder _ to random off diagonal matrix elements of the hamiltonian ( _ off - diagonal disorder _ ) by doubling the hilbert space ( for a binary alloy ) and adding the atomic sort to the matrix indices@xcite .",
    "the _ environmental disorder _",
    "term is treated in the virtual crystal approximation in the same manner as done by theumann@xcite(to be referred to as i ) , where an atom a(b ) will be acted upon by a mean field so that full randomness will be preserved in the locator expression of cpa .",
    "furthermore , considering the tyablikov decoupling approximation for the disordered green s function , magnetization of the different constituents need to be determined self - consistently for a given temperature because the locator and the local magnon spectral density are temperature dependent . in general , the analytical form of the local magnon spectral density can be got only for some simple cases such as the exchange integrals restricted to only nearest neighbors@xcite .",
    "analytically , the calculations where @xmath9 are long ranged is not an easy task .",
    "however , long - range interaction are always of interest in different fields of physics because they can give rise to a variety of unusual macroscopic behavior .",
    "for example , metallic magnetic materials are of itinerant type , which means that the exchange integrals between different localized magnetic ions are long range and driven by the polarization of the conduction carrier gas , i.e. the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) type exchange interaction@xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we calculate magnetization and curie temperature of different components with ferromagnetic short - range , power - law decaying long - range and oscillating rkky long - range exchange interaction . it should be mentioned here that the idea of using the virtual crystal approximation and beb - cpa to deal with three kinds of disorder(_diagonal , off - diagonal and environmental _ ) of a binary spin system is same as paper i. however , our approach to solve the self - consistent cpa equations , which differs from paper i , follows the beb - cpa method .",
    "moreover , we present the method to calculate the temperature dependence of magnetization and the curie temperature of systems by combining the methods of paper i and the rpa - cpa theory@xcite done by g. bouzerar et .",
    "significantly , we can calculate any range exchange integrals(including short - range and long - range ) .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] , we deal with different types of disorder and derive the configurational averaged green s functions , magnetization and curie temperature for systems with ferromagnetic short - range , ferromagnetic long - range and rkky - type long - range exchange interactions .",
    "the numerical calculations of the self - consistent equations are discussed in [ sec : numerical_studies ] for exchange integrals of a long - range power - law decay @xmath10 and a rkky - type @xmath11 . in section [ sec : summary ] , we will conclude the article with a summary .",
    "to study the magnetic properties of a material @xmath12 carrying a localized magnetic moment at each lattice site , we assume the dynamics of these spins to be reasonably described by the isotropic heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath13 where subscripts @xmath7 and @xmath8 refer to the occupied lattice sites , and @xmath14 is the spin operator of the localized magnetic moment at lattice site @xmath7 with lattice vector @xmath15 .",
    "the hamiltonian contains a zeeman coupling of the spins , where the external magnetic field is @xmath16 .",
    "the effective heisenberg exchange parameters @xmath9 obey @xmath17 and @xmath18 restricting the theory to uniform media and disregarding more general case .",
    "firstly , we generalize the hamiltonian such that @xmath9 is random : +    [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]      + where the bracket @xmath19 means a configurational average .",
    "then , we get @xmath20    introducing the retarded magnon green s function @xmath21 built up by the step operators @xmath22 , its equation of motion reads @xmath23 making the tyablikov approximation , which consists in decoupling the higher green s function on the rhs . of , one obtains after rearrangement : @xmath24 g_{ij}(e )",
    "\\\\ = 2\\hbar^2{\\left\\langle{s^{z}_{i}}\\right\\rangle}\\delta_{ij } -    2\\hbar{\\left\\langle{s^{z}_{i}}\\right\\rangle } \\sum_{m } j_{im}g_{mj}\\;.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    substituting @xmath25 by equation , we use the various combinations @xmath26 to multiple the equation in beb manner .",
    "then , the green s functions equation of motion can be expressed as , @xmath27 if we introduce the @xmath28 matrices @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31 where @xmath32 ( @xmath33 = a or b , @xmath34 ) , @xmath35 and    [ eq : local potential ] @xmath36    now we find , as in beb , that the matrix propagator @xmath37 satisfies an equation for a problem with only local disorder , the matrix @xmath38 being independent of the random numbers .",
    "however , the so called local potential @xmath39 and @xmath40 are functions of random variables . using the virtual crystal approximation as done by paper i",
    ", the equation can be written as    [ eq : virtual potential ] @xmath41    considering , for any site @xmath7 , @xmath42 in an exchange - integral and lattice - structure given spin system , the local potential @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which describe local site occupation , are constants .",
    "in other words , the exchange interaction of neighbor spins of site @xmath7 leads to a static field which acts on site @xmath7 .",
    "the static field is of independence on the location of site @xmath7 as the external magnetic field * b * does .",
    "thus , in our approach , the exchange interaction of neighbor spins of site @xmath7 is taken as an additional static field .",
    "the difference between @xmath39 and @xmath40 root in whether an atom of type a or of type b occupies site @xmath7 . in our model ,",
    "the random a - type or b - type occupation of any site decide the local potential @xmath39 or @xmath40 , respectively . from here",
    ", our calculation will follow the beb - cpa methods and differ from paper i.    if we refer to three specific @xmath43-dependent parameters as a matrix form in beb - cpa manner @xmath44 the cpa self - consistent condition is expressed as@xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46^{-1}$ ] and @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the fourier transform of the parameters of exchange interaction @xmath49 .",
    "the renormalized locator can be written as @xmath50 where    [ eq : gamma ab ] @xmath51    in general , the introduced @xmath28 matrix @xmath52 describes effective medium properties@xcite . from the denominator of the renormalized locators",
    ", we find @xmath52 has the same dimensions of exchange parameters @xmath53 .",
    "so , according to beb - cpa theory , the effective medium parameters @xmath52 present the appropriate sum of the exchange integrals and are called the renormalized interactor .",
    "once we get two renormalized locators @xmath54 and @xmath55 from cpa self - consistent equations , the magnon spectral function can be expressed as @xmath56 furthermore , magnetization reads @xmath57 where @xmath58 and the average magnon number @xmath59 can be calculated by @xmath60    now , for a given temperature and good starting value of @xmath61 , we can get the renormalized locators @xmath62 and the magnon spectral functoin @xmath63 from cpa self - consistent equations .",
    "furthermore , by using the equation , we can calculate new values of magnetization @xmath61 , which are re - inserted in @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "considering @xmath66 in the limit @xmath67 , we can get the curie temperature @xmath68 where @xmath69    to study the influence of the range of a ferromagnetic exchange interaction on magnetization , we need to calculate @xmath48 and @xmath70 with ferromagnetic decaying long - range @xmath71 here , @xmath72 is the maximum distance out of which the spin - spin interaction is not taken into account in the calculations , @xmath73 is the lattice constant and @xmath74 the nearest - neighbor interaction strength . for @xmath75",
