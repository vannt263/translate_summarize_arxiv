    "ray counterpart of sgra * ( see sidoli et al .",
    "1999 for details ) , confirming the underluminosity of this presumed supermassive black hole at high energies .",
    "intense diffuse x  ray emission is also present in the gc region , the nature of which is still poorly known . here",
    "we present the bepposax results on the diffuse emission from the sgra complex ( sidoli & mereghetti 1999 ) .    -5truecm",
    "the sgr  a region has been imaged with the mecs instruments ( 1.310 kev ) with a spatial resolution of @xmath7 ( about 2.5 pc at the gc distance ) in august 1997 ( 99.5 ksec net exposure time ) .    in order to study the spectral properties of the diffuse emission coming from the sgra complex , we extracted the mecs counts from four concentric annular regions ( @xmath8,@xmath9,@xmath10,@xmath11 ) around sgra*.    several emission lines are present in all the spectra , with the k - lines from iron ( e@xmath12  kev ) and sulfur ( e@xmath13  kev ) particularly bright .",
    "the fit with a single temperature hot plasma model showed a nearly constant temperature ( @xmath14 kev ) at radii larger than 2@xmath1 , while in the innermost circle a softer spectrum ( kt@xmath15 kev ) was found .",
    "this is probably due to the contribution from one ( or more ) point source(s ) located close to sgra * ( predehl & trmper 1994 , maeda et al .",
    "1996 , sidoli et al .",
    "1999 ) , that can not be spatially resolved in our data .",
    "since the temperature profile does not show spectral variations in the region from @xmath16 to @xmath17 , we studied the overall spectrum from this entire corona .",
    "a single temperature plasma ( mekal model ) is not adequate to describe the spectrum , leaving positive residuals at low energy and especially around 6.4 kev .",
    "this can be due to the presence of fluorescent emission from neutral or weakly ionized iron in the nearby molecular clouds ( koyama et al .",
    "thus we added a lower temperature plasma component plus a gaussian line at 6.4 kev .",
    "the resulting best fit is a double  temperature plasma , with kt@xmath20.6  kev and kt@xmath38  kev ( n@xmath18=8@xmath19  @xmath20 ) and a gaussian line at 6.4 kev with an equivalent width of @xmath21120 ev ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "the total flux corrected for the absorption is f@xmath22  erg  @xmath20  s@xmath5 ( 210 kev ) , which translates into a luminosity of l@xmath23  erg  s@xmath5 .",
    "about one third of the flux is contributed by the soft component .    -3.5truecm",
    "-2truecm      -2truecm    the spatial distribution of the diffuse emission was studied extracting two images in different energy ranges , below and above 5 kev ( see fig .",
    "both emissions are peaked at the gc position , but they have significantly different spatial distributions : the soft emission ( 25 kev ) displays a triangular shape , while the hard one ( 510 kev ) is elliptical and elongated in the direction of the galactic plane . while the hard emission can be simply part of the diffuse emission permeating the inner 60@xmath24 of the galactic disk ( e.g. kaneda et al .",
    "1997 ) , the soft x ",
    "rays are spatially correlated with a structure observed in the radio band , known as the sgr  a east triangular halo ( pedlar et al .",
    "this is an extended non  thermal structure ( probably a snr ) which surrounds in projection sgra*. since also our spectral data are well described by a two  temperature thermal model , it is tempting to give an interpretation in terms of two plasma components with different temperatures and spatial distributions . from the spectral analysis of the lower temperature plasma ( kt@xmath25  kev ) , we derive a luminosity @xmath26  ergs  s@xmath5 ( 210 kev ) , an electron density n@xmath27  @xmath28 , a total mass @xmath29 and an average thermal pressure @xmath30  ergs  @xmath28 , consistent with the pressure @xmath31  erg  @xmath28 derived for a snr in a sedov phase .",
    "the bepposax observation of the sgra complex revealed the presence of at least two distinct components : a soft component with kt@xmath210.51 kev spatially correlated with the sgra  east @xmath32 triangular halo , and a hard one with kt@xmath2179 kev elongated along the galactic plane and possibly associated with the harder component of the galactic ridge emission .",
    "the soft component , which accounts for about one third of the 2 - 10 kev diffuse luminosity from the sgra complex , can be well explained as thermal emission from the snr responsible for the radio halo of the sgra east shell ."
