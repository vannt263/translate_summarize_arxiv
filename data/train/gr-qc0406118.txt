    "<S> in the description of _ relative _ motion in accelerated systems and gravitational fields , inertial and tidal accelerations must be taken into account , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these involve a critical speed that in the first approximation can be simply illustrated in the case of motion in one dimension . for one - dimensional motion , </S>",
    "<S> such first - order accelerations are multiplied by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the critical speed . </S>",
    "<S> if the speed of relative motion exceeds @xmath2 , there is a sign reversal with consequences that are contrary to newtonian expectations .    in four recent papers on the generalized jacobi equation  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we have considered the consequences of general relativity for the _ relative _ motion of nearby timelike geodesics when the speed of relative motion is arbitrary but of course less than @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> our main results , which can be clearly seen in the case of one - dimensional motion , depend on whether the speed of relative motion is above or below the critical speed @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> for one - dimensional motion with relative velocity @xmath5 , the tidal force acting on a particle is multiplied by the factor @xmath6 , thus leading to tidal effects for @xmath7 that are counterintuitive when compared to newtonian expectations . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , starting from the generalized jacobi equation ( which includes only first - order tidal effects ) in a fermi coordinate system @xmath8 established along the reference geodesic and restricting attention to a two - dimensional world @xmath9 , the equation of relative motion reduces to @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the gaussian curvature of the surface @xmath12 evaluated along the worldline of the reference geodesic and @xmath13 ( see  @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this letter is to demonstrate that the critical speed @xmath1 appears as well in the physics of translationally accelerated systems in minkowski spacetime ; that is , it is a general feature of the theory of relativity . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we consider two nearby worldlines in minkowski spacetime : a reference worldline @xmath14 that is arbitrarily accelerated and a geodesic worldline @xmath15 ; we are interested in the motion of the free particle @xmath15 relative to the noninertial observer @xmath14 . referred to the observer s accelerated system , the motion of @xmath15 is subject to translational and rotational inertial accelerations . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that relativistic inertial accelerations exist that go beyond newtonian mechanics and are essentially due to the translational acceleration of @xmath14 . in this case , the inertial acceleration of @xmath15 in the first approximation is multiplied by @xmath6 for motion along the direction of translational acceleration .    </S>",
    "<S> imagine an arbitrary accelerated observer @xmath14 following a worldline @xmath16 in minkowski spacetime . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath17 are inertial coordinates in the background global frame and @xmath18 is the proper time of the observer , i.e. @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the minkowski metric tensor with signature @xmath21 . unless otherwise specified , we choose units such that @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the observer has four - velocity @xmath23 and translational acceleration @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , at each instant of time along its worldline the observer is endowed with an orthonormal tetrad frame @xmath25 such that @xmath26 and @xmath27 the variation of this tetrad along the worldline of the observer is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an antisymmetric tensor by equation  . </S>",
    "<S> this _ </S>",
    "<S> acceleration tensor _ has `` electric '' and `` magnetic '' components given respectively by @xmath30 and @xmath31 in close analogy with the faraday tensor . </S>",
    "<S> that is , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where the spacetime scalars @xmath34 and @xmath35 represent respectively the local translational acceleration , @xmath36 , and the frequency of rotation of the local spatial frame of the observer with respect to a local nonrotating ( i.e. fermi - walker transported ) frame . </S>",
    "<S> we note that @xmath37 , hence @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider the most physically natural ( fermi ) coordinate system in the neighborhood of the worldline of the accelerated observer  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> that is , we wish to establish a geodesic coordinate system along the path of the observer based on the tetrad @xmath25 . at </S>",
    "<S> any given proper time @xmath18 , the straight spacelike geodesic lines normal to the observer s worldline span a euclidean hyperplane . </S>",
    "<S> for a point on this hyperplane with inertial coordinates @xmath41 , let @xmath42 be the geodesic ( fermi ) coordinates such that @xmath43 and @xmath44 differentiating this equation and using equation  , we find @xmath45\\,{{\\rmd}}x^0 + \\lambda^\\mu_{\\;\\;(i)}\\,{{\\rmd}}x^i,\\ ] ] where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are given by @xmath48 thus the minkowski metric @xmath49 can now be written in geodesic coordinates as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 it is simple to see that @xmath52 and @xmath53 the observer @xmath14 occupies the spatial origin of the fermi coordinates , which are admissible for @xmath54 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the domain of admissibility has been investigated in  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the connection coefficients are evaluated using equations   and  . </S>",
    "<S> the only nonzero christoffel symbols are given by @xmath55_i.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here an overdot denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath56 and we have introduced the vector @xmath57 it is important to observe here that @xmath58 and @xmath59 are given in the local tetrad frame by @xmath60 and @xmath61 , where @xmath62 .    </S>",
    "<S> the free particle @xmath15 follows a geodesic in the new coordinate system . to express its motion relative to the reference observer @xmath14 </S>",
    "<S> , we need the reduced geodesic equation  @xcite in the new coordinate system @xmath63 where the christoffel symbols are given by equations   and  . </S>",
    "<S> the result is @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 . here </S>",
    "<S> the presence of the speed of light @xmath3 has been made explicit so that relativistic corrections to the newtonian inertial accelerations can be easily identified .    </S>",
    "<S> equation   contains the fully relativistic inertial accelerations of a free particle with respect to an accelerating and rotating reference system and has been derived in various forms by a number of authors ( see  @xcite and the references cited therein ) . in the case of pure rotation ( @xmath67 ) , the inertial accelerations in equation   are just as in newtonian mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> we note that a critical speed of @xmath68 has appeared in the treatment of the motion of relativistic charged particles in the field of rotating magnetic lines of force corresponding to pulsar magnetospheres  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this critical speed turns out to be due to the particular mechanical model of the electromagnetic system discussed in  @xcite . in the theory of relativity </S>",
    "<S> , there is no critical speed associated with rotation per se as is evident from equation  . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is different in the case of translational acceleration ; however , before we turn to the case of purely translational accelerations , let us note the existence of relativistic inertial accelerations in equation   that are due to the coupling of acceleration and rotation .    </S>",
    "<S> set @xmath69 and note that equation   reduces to @xmath70 in the newtonian limit @xmath71 , this equation reduces to a standard result : from the viewpoint of the observer , the free particle has acceleration @xmath72 . writing @xmath30 in equation   in terms of its components parallel and perpendicular to the instantaneous direction of the velocity @xmath73 , @xmath74 , the parallel component of the inertial acceleration in equation   to first order in @xmath30 and neglecting @xmath75 is given by @xmath76 . to illustrate this result </S>",
    "<S> , it is useful to assume one - dimensional motion of @xmath15 along the @xmath77-direction such that @xmath78 . in this case , to first order in @xmath79 and neglecting @xmath80 , the inertial acceleration is simply given by @xmath81 . without these approximations , </S>",
    "<S> the acceleration of the free particle relative to the observer at its position ( @xmath82 ) is @xmath83 so that if @xmath84 , the free particle has the expected direction of acceleration as observed by @xmath14 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath85 the inertial acceleration of @xmath15 reverses direction . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is schematically illustrated in figure  [ fig:1 ] . if @xmath86 , @xmath15 has no inertial acceleration at @xmath87  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us recall that in the standard discussion of einstein s heuristic principle of equivalence , the observer at rest in the `` elevator '' that is accelerated with acceleration @xmath30 determines the acceleration of a free particle @xmath15 ( `` apple '' ) that moves past the observer along the same line . </S>",
    "<S> the standard discussion is limited to the newtonian limit and in that limit the acceleration of @xmath15 is @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> however , if relativistic effects are taken into account , then the correct answer is given by equation  . </S>",
    "<S> for relative speed above @xmath1 , the direction of acceleration is opposite to the result of newtonian mechanics , which is counterintuitive , since our intuition is based on newtonian expectations .    to clarify these issues further , </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a uniformly accelerated observer in hyperbolic motion with acceleration @xmath88 moving along the positive @xmath89-direction in the background global inertial frame . </S>",
    "<S> the worldline of the observer is given by @xmath90 so that at @xmath91 , the observer is at rest at @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> the natural nonrotating tetrad frame along the observer s worldline has nonzero components @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , where @xmath96 and @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> it follows from equation   that the inertial coordinates are related to the coordinates of the accelerated ( geodesic ) frame via @xmath98 so that at @xmath99 , equations   reduce to equation  . </S>",
    "<S> the new ( rindler ) coordinates are @xmath100 and @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the rindler horizon and corresponds to a null cone in the inertial frame , since @xmath103 .    </S>",
    "<S> the free particle follows a straight line in the inertial frame and this fact can be used to find an explicit solution to equation   in this case . </S>",
    "<S> we limit our discussion to motion of the free particle along the @xmath89-direction @xmath104 such that at @xmath105 it passes the observer with relative speed @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> it follows from equations   that @xmath107 computing the inertial acceleration of the free particle with respect to the observer , we find that @xmath108 , where @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the same result that we obtained before in equation   for the general case of variable acceleration .    </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to extend our analysis of the motion of @xmath15 relative to @xmath14 to the curved spacetime of general relativity along the lines indicated in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the interesting factor @xmath110 turns out to be the same for both tidal accelerations as well as the translational inertial acceleration : it comes about in the transition from the standard geodesic equation to its reduced form  . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the factor @xmath111 is basically due to the representation of the motion of @xmath15 in terms of the proper time of the observer @xmath14 rather than the proper time of the free particle @xmath15 .    </S>",
    "<S> the physical phenomena associated with the factor @xmath112 in equations and come about only when the motion of @xmath15 is referred to fermi coordinates ; that is , they do not in general appear in any other coordinate system . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , equations and are constructed from scalar invariants and thus express real physically measurable effects . </S>",
    "<S> this circumstance may be illustrated as follows : the magnitude of the solution of equation  , @xmath113 , is the proper distance between the worldlines of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , measured along a spacelike geodesic that is normal to the worldline of the observer @xmath14 at its proper time @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> as such , this invariant quantity can be computed in any admissible system of coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> fermi coordinates are advantageous in practice as they are the most physically natural system of coordinates ; therefore , equations   and   can be subjected to _ </S>",
    "<S> direct _ experimental test if the observer employs a local coordinate system that closely approximates a fermi system .    finally , let us remark that the proper critical speed @xmath68 has also been discussed for one - dimensional relative motion along the radial direction in the context of the exterior schwarzschild geometry in  @xcite . </S>"
