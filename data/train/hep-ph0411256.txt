    "the study of medium modifications of the d - meson has become a subject of recent interest because the important consequences for open - charm enhancement in nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite as well as for @xmath1 suppression @xcite .",
    "the na50 collaboration @xcite has observed an enhancement of dimuons in pb+pb collisions which has been attributed to an open - charm enhancement in nucleus - nucleus collisions relative to proton - nucleus reactions . on the other hand , an appreciable contribution for the @xmath1 suppression",
    "is expected to be due to the formation of the quark - gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "however , the suppression could also be understood in an hadronic environment due to inelastic comover scattering and , therefore , the medium modification of the d - mesons should modify the @xmath1 absorption @xcite .",
    "finally , the d - mesic nuclei , predicted by the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model @xcite , could also give us information about the in - medium properties of the d - meson .",
    "it is shown that the @xmath2 meson forms narrow bound states with @xmath3 while the @xmath4 is deeply bound in nuclei .",
    "it is thus of importance to understand the interactions of the d - mesons in the hadronic medium .",
    "calculations based on the qcd sum - rule ( qsr ) approach @xcite as well as on the qmc model @xcite predict the mass drop of the d - meson to be of the order of 50 - 60 mev at nuclear matter density .",
    "a similar drop at finite temperature is suggested from the lattice calculations for heavy - quark potentials @xcite together with a recent work based on a chiral model @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we study the spectral density of a d - meson embedded in dense matter incorporating the coupled - channel effects as well as the dressing of the intermediate propagators which have been ignored in the previous works",
    ". these effects will turn out to be crucial for describing the d - meson in dense matter @xcite .",
    "in order to obtain the d - meson self - energy in dense matter and , hence , the spectral density , the knowledge of the in - medium dn interaction is required .",
    "this amplitude is obtained taking , as a bare interaction , a separable potential model @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the coupling constant and cutoff , respectively .",
    "these two parameters will be determined by fixing the position and the width of the @xmath0 resonance . for the interaction matrix @xmath8",
    ", we use the result derived from su(3 ) flavor symmetry .",
    "we are , therefore , confronted with a coupled - channel problem since this interaction allows for the transition from dn to other channels , namely , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , all having charm @xmath13 . with this structure in mind ,",
    "the g - matrix is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 represent the possible mesons ( d , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) and baryons ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) respectively , and their corresponding quantum numbers , and @xmath22 is the starting energy .",
    "the function @xmath23 stands for the pauli operator while @xmath24 is the meson ( baryon ) single - particle energy .",
    "then , the d - meson single - particle potential in the brueckner - hartree - fock approach reads @xmath25 where the summation over nucleonic states is limited by the nucleon fermi momentum . as it can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : self ] ) , since the dn interaction ( @xmath26-matrix ) depends on the d - meson single - particle energy , which in turn depends on the d - meson potential , we are confronted with a self - consistent problem .",
    "after self - consistency for the on - shell value @xmath27 is achieved , one can obtain the full self - energy @xmath28 .",
    "this self - energy can then be used to determine the d - meson single - particle propagator and the corresponding spectral density .",

    "our coupled - channel calculation generates dynamically the @xmath0 resonance . the position ( @xmath34 mev ) and width ( @xmath35 mev ) are obtained for a given set of coupling constants and cutoffs .",
    "once the position and width of the @xmath0 resonance are reproduced dynamically , we study the effect of the different medium modifications on the resonance . in the r.h.s . of fig .",
    "[ fig : dmeson1 ] we display the real and imaginary parts of the s - wave dn amplitude for @xmath29 and @xmath30 within different approaches .",
    "when the nucleons and pions are dressed , the picture depicted is completely different to the case when only d - mesons are dressed self - consistently . in this case , for @xmath29 , we observe two structures : one structure around 2.5 gev below the @xmath10 threshold and a second one at 2.8 gev , which lies below the dn threshold .",
    "both structures are states with the @xmath20-like quantum numbers .",
    "whether the first resonant structure is the in - medium @xmath0 resonance and the second bump is a new resonance is something that deserves further studies .",
    "[ t ] 65 mm    in order to study the dependence on the cutoff and coupling constants together with the isospin dependence of the in - medium dn interaction , on the l.h.s . of fig .",
    "[ fig : dmeson2 ] we show the real and imaginary parts of the d - meson potential at @xmath36 as a function of the density . in the case that only the d - meson is dressed ( left panels ) , and fixing @xmath31 gev , the d - meson potential is governed by the @xmath30 component while , when nucleons and pions are dressed ( right panels ) , the @xmath29 component dominates due to the structure present at 2.8 gev in the g - matrix . with regards to the dependence on the cutoff and coupling",
    "constant , we observe a weak dependence on the chosen set of parameters for both approaches .",
    "however , it is interesting to see that , for any chosen parameters , the coupled - channel effects seem to result in an overall reduction of the in - medium effects independent of the in - medium properties compared to previous works @xcite .",
    "for example , when nucleons and pions are dressed in the self - consistent process , the attraction lies in between @xmath37 $ ] mev for @xmath38 $ ] gev at normal nuclear matter density @xmath39 .",
    "finally , the spectral density at zero momentum is shown on the r.h.s .",
    "[ fig : dmeson2 ] for @xmath31 gev and for several densities in the two self - consistent approaches considered before . in the first approach ( left panel ) , the quasiparticle peak moves slightly to lower energies while the @xmath20 resonance is seen for energies around 1.63 - 1.65 gev . for the second approach ( right panel ) , the structure around 2.8 gev of fig .",
    "[ fig : dmeson1 ] mixes with the quasiparticle peak .",
    "we have performed a microscopic self - consistent coupled - channel calculation of the d - meson spectral density embedded in symmetric nuclear matter assuming , as bare interaction , a separable potential @xcite .",
    "we have obtained the @xmath40 dynamically and we have concluded that the self - consistent coupled - channel effects result in a small attractive real part of the in - medium potential for d - mesons .",
    "however , the production of d - mesons in the nuclear medium will be still enhanced due to the broad d - meson spectral density .",
    "this effect is similar to the one obtained for the enhanced @xmath41 production in heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the in - medium effects seen in this work can be studied with the future panda experiment at gsi @xcite .",
