    "high energy scattering provides a clean picture of the quarks momentum distribution for a nucleon boosted into infinite momentum frame ( imf ) .",
    "measurements of elastic scattering at lower energy scales allow extraction of the nucleon form factors , which can be related to the spatial distribution of charge in the rest frame of the nucleon .",
    "however , obtaining rest frame charge distributions requires model - dependent relativistic boost corrections , limiting our ability to extract these distributions from data .",
    "significant work has gone into better understanding the issues involved in studying nucleon distributions , as well as providing unified descriptions of the space and momentum distributions of the quarks .",
    "the present discussion and the papers on which it is based would not have been possible without the great amount of experimental technique , effort and ingenuity that has been used recently to measure the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon@xcite .",
    "these quantities are probability amplitudes that the nucleon can absorb a given amount of momentum and remain in the ground state , and are related to the nucleon charge and magnetization densities .",
    "we note that there will be an institute for nuclear theory program held in the fall of 2009 that is devoted to the electromagnetic physics of the jefferson laboratory upgrade to 12 gev .",
    "please see the website : www.int.washington.edu/programs/09-03.html .",
    "we begin our analysis by reviewing recent work@xcite that determines the transverse charge density of the neutron in a model independent way .",
    "this work surprisingly found that the central charge density is negative .",
    "then we discuss how the inclusive - exclusive connection is used to provide an interpretation for this fact@xcite .",
    "we begin by by presenting definitions of the form factors .",
    "let @xmath3 be the electromagnetic current operator , in units of the proton charge .",
    "then the nucleon form factors are given by the matrix element p,| j^(0)| p,=|u(p, ) ( ^f_1(q^2)+iq_f_2(q^2 ) ) u(p,),where @xmath4 is the nucleon mass , and the momentum transfer @xmath5 is taken as space - like , so that @xmath6 the nucleon polarization states are chosen to be those of definite light - cone helicities @xmath7.@xcite the charge ( dirac ) form factor is @xmath8 , normalized such that @xmath9 is the nucleon charge , and the magnetic ( pauli ) form factor is @xmath10 , normalized such that @xmath11 is the anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "the sachs form factors are @xmath12    in the breit frame , in which @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the nucleon helicity flip matrix element of @xmath15 .",
    "this has been interpreted as meaning that @xmath14 is the three - dimensional fourier transform of the charge density in the rest frame .",
    "indeed , the scattering of neutrons from the electron cloud of atoms measures the derivative @xmath16 at @xmath17 , which has been widely interpreted as the mean - square charge radius of the neutron . however , a direct probability or density interpretation of @xmath14 is spoiled by a non - zero value of @xmath18 , no matter how small .",
    "this is because relativistic dynamics , which cause the wave functions of the initial and final nucleons of different momenta to differ , must be used .",
    "the final wave function is related to the initial one by a complicated boost operator that when acting on the initial state of a given momentum changes it to the same of the different final momentum . in general the boost operator ( or boost ) contains the effects of interactions .",
    "thus the initial and final states differ , invalidating a probability or density interpretation .",
    "it is only in the case that non - relativistic dynamics are applicable that form factors are simply the fourier transforms of the rest frame spatial distributions .",
    "it has commonly been assumed that at low momentum transfers , these corrections could be safely neglected .",
    "if we treat relativistic corrections as in atomic physics , they are governed by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the mass of the boosted constituent .",
    "computing the form factors involves integrating over the momentum @xmath21 so that it is replaced by the momentum transfer @xmath22 .",
    "thus for small values of @xmath18 we find g_e(q^2 ) = g_e(0)- q^26 ( d^3r r^2 ( r ) + c / m^2),where @xmath23 is an unknown coefficient . in a simple constituent quark model , @xmath24  mev , and",
    "so these @xmath25 boost corrections are negligible only for @xmath26  gev@xmath27 .",
    "however , for the neutron @xmath28 , so the corrections are expected to be relatively large .",
    "the boost correction term need not be small compared to the finite size contribution unless @xmath29 ; since both corrections scale with @xmath18 , the relative correction to the extracted radius does not vanish as @xmath18 approaches 0 .",
    "the constituent quarks represent the low @xmath18 , dressed versions of the near - massless current quarks of qcd . for current quarks of mass 510  mev ,",
    "the boost corrections are important for all @xmath18 values where measurements exist .",
    "while it is possible to construct systematically improveable models which should yield a complete description of the nucleon , it is not clear how one would quantitatively determine how well any particular model fully reproduces the corrections associated with the relativistic boost .",
    "thus , there is always some model dependence in the extraction of the rest frame charge distributions from the form factors , and it is not clear how well one can quantify these corrections and uncertainties , even at very low @xmath18 .",
    "the use of light cone coordinates and the kinematic subgroup of the poincar group , which is closely related to the use of the infinite momentum frame , enables one to avoid the difficulties associated with including the boost .",
    "the basic idea is that the `` time '' variable is given by @xmath30 and the conjugate evolution operator is given by @xmath31 starting in an ordinary reference frame and making a lorentz transformation into a frame moving with nearly the speed of light in the @xmath32 direction converts the usual @xmath33 into @xmath34 .",
    "the 3 spatial variables must be different than @xmath34 , so we take @xmath35 if @xmath36 then @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be thought of as something like a @xmath39 or @xmath40 variable , but rotational invariance can not generally be used to relate the @xmath38 and @xmath41 dependence of the density .",
    "the canonically conjugate momentum to @xmath38 is @xmath42 for the transverse degrees of freedom we use the usual position @xmath43 and momentum @xmath44 variables denoted by @xmath45 where the boldface notation denotes a transverse vector .",
    "we also exploit the kinematic subgroup .",
    "that is transverse lorentz transformations , with a transverse velocity @xmath46 ( or boosts in the transverse @xmath41 or @xmath47 direction ) do not involve interactions . in particular , these transformations are defined by @xmath48 with @xmath49 changed so that @xmath50 is not changed .",
    "these transformations are just like the non - relativistic galilei transformation except that @xmath51 appears instead of a mass .",
    "this means that we are allowed to do fourier transformations of variables provided transverse degrees of freedom are involved .",
    "if the momentum transfer vector @xmath52 is space - like we may use the so - called drell - yan ( dy ) frame in which @xmath53 .",
    "this means that the plus component of the momentum of the nucleon is the same before and after the absorption of the single photon .",
    "then the momentum transfer vector is in the transverse direction , so that usual two - dimensional fourier transform techniques can be used .",
    "a proper determination of a charge density requires the measurement of a density operator .",
    "we shall show that measurements of the pion form factor directly involve the three - dimensional parton charge density operator , in the infinite momentum frame imf , @xmath54 . in this frame",
    "the electromagnetic charge density @xmath15 becomes @xmath55 and _",

    "we set the time variable , @xmath58 to zero , and do not display it in any function .",
    "the spatial structure of a hadron can be examined if one uses@xcite states that are transversely localized .",
    "the state with transverse center of mass @xmath59 set to * 0 * is formed by taking a linear superposition of states of transverse momentum :    @xmath60 are light - cone helicity eigenstates @xcite and @xmath61 is a normalization factor satisfying @xmath62 .",

    "the nucleon states are normalized as @xmath65 .",
    "next we relate the charge density _ ( x^-,)= , to @xmath66 . in the dy frame",
    "no momentum is transferred in the plus - direction , so that information regarding the @xmath38 dependence of the distribution is not accessible .",
    "therefore we integrate over @xmath38 , using the relationship translational invariance , and then use our momentum expansion and the definition of @xmath8 as the helicity non - flip matrix element of @xmath55 in a drell - yan frame to find & & ( b)dx^-_(x^-,b)[rhobtx ] + & & ( b)= f_1(q^2=^2 ) e^-i= f_1(q^2)j_0(qb ) e^-i , [ rhob0]where @xmath67 is a cylindrical bessel function and @xmath68 is termed the transverse charge density , giving the charge density at a transverse position @xmath69 , integrating over all longitudinal momentum . in the infinite momentum frame ,",
    "the longitudinal dimension of the nucleon is contracted to a point , and only the transverse position remains .",
    "the value of @xmath70 corresponds to the center of longitudinal - momentum of the nucleon in the transverse dimension .",
    "it is not as straightforward to isolate the magnetization distribution , and there have been multiple such densities proposed @xcite .",
    "starting with the matrix element of @xmath71 and working in the infinite momentum frame leads to the result that the transverse magnetization density to is the two - dimensional fourier transform of @xmath10 , just as the charge density is the transform of @xmath8 @xcite .",
