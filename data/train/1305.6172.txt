    "in numerous biological processes the emergence and maintenance of polarized states in the form of heterogeneous distributions of chemical substances ( proteins , lipids ) is essential .",
    "such symmetry breaking for example precedes the formation of buds in yeast cells , determines directions of movement , or mediates differentiation and development of cells .",
    "polarized states in biological cells often arise in response to external signals , typically from the outer cell membrane .",
    "transport processes and interacting networks of diffusing and reacting substances both within the cell and on the cell membrane then amplify and process such signals .",
    "the distribution of small gtpase molecules in eukaryotic cells presents one example of a complex system with polarization and motivates the present paper .",
    "such molecules can be in an active and in an inactive state .",
    "activation and deactivation typically occurs at the cell membrane and is catalyzed by specific enzymes .",
    "in addition to the activation - deactivation cycle gtpase molecules ( in its inactive form ) shuttle between the membrane and the cytosol , i.e. the inner volume of the cell , by attachment to and detachment from the membrane .",
    "these properties induce the specific form of a coupled volume ( bulk ) and surface reaction  diffusion system .",
    "the goal here is to investigate a possible contribution of diffusive instabilities to cell polarization in such coupled systems .",
    "different deterministic continuous models have been used to investigate polarization of cells ( see for example the review @xcite ) .",
    "we consider here a particular class of models that takes the form of a reaction - diffusion system on the membrane coupled to a diffusion process in the interior of the cell .",
    "this model has been introduced in @xcite where a reduction to a non - local reaction - diffusion system , involving only membrane variables , has been investigated .",
    "a key question in such systems is whether a turing - type mechanism may contribute to the polarization of cells , with activated gtpase and inactive gtpase representing self - activator and substrate , respectively .",
    "turing - type instabilities however require large differences in the diffusion constants for activator and substrate ( or inhibitor ) .",
    "the lateral diffusion on the membrane for active and inactive gtpase on the other hand is in general of comparable size and therefore a turing instability appears at first glance unrealistic . on the other hand , cytosolic diffusion in cells",
    "is typically much faster than lateral diffusion and might induce the necessary difference in diffusion .",
    "it is therefore tempting to hypothesize that in such coupled 2d and 3d reaction ",
    "diffusion systems diffusive instabilities can in fact contribute to cell polarization .",
    "we will in the following represent the cytosolic volume and the membrane of a cell by a bounded , connected , open domain @xmath0 in space and its two - dimensional boundary @xmath1 respectively .",
    "we assume that @xmath2 is given by a smooth , closed surface and denote by @xmath3 the outer unit normal of @xmath4 on @xmath2 .",
    "further we fix a time interval of observation @xmath5 \\subset { \\mathbb{r}}$ ] and consider smooth functions @xmath6 , @xmath7 ( representing the cytosolic inactive , membrane - bound active , and membrane - bound inactive gtpase , respectively ) that satisfy the coupled reaction  diffusion system ( stated in a non - dimensional form ) @xmath8 here @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent the activation / inactivation processes and @xmath11 describes attachment / detachment at the membrane . in the appendix we present as specific example the mathematical model for the gtpase cycle from @xcite with explicit choices for @xmath9 and @xmath11 that we also use in our numerical simulations below .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 is a non - dimensional parameter that is related to the spatial scale of the cell .",
    "the coupling of bulk and surface processes in  is given in form of a robin - type boundary condition .",
    "the system is complemented by initial conditions at time @xmath13 , @xmath14 we remark that the system  automatically satisfies conservation of total mass , i.e. @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes integration with respect to the surface area measure .    in this contribution",
    "we investigate the possibility of diffusive instabilities for systems of the form . we present a linear stability analysis and numerical simulations .",
    "we find two possible scenarios for a diffusive instability of spatially homogeneous stationary states .",
    "the first needs large differences in lateral diffusion for @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( i.e. a coefficient @xmath19 ) and resembles a classical turing instability in the @xmath20 variables .",
    "the second mechanism on the other hand does also occur for equal lateral diffusion constants @xmath21 and is rather based on the different diffusion constants for @xmath17 and @xmath22 and therefore on the coupling of bulk and surface equations . as cytosolic diffusion is typically by a factor hundred faster than lateral diffusion , this scenario is much more realistic in the application to signaling networks . in section [ sec : turingnonlocala ]",
    "we compare the stability of the full system to its reduction in the formal limit @xmath23 .",
    "the latter leads to a non - local two - variable system on the membrane that has been analyzed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "there we have only covered the first more ` classical ' instability mechanism and have not included a complete characterization of diffusive instabilities . here",
    "we show that  in coincidence with the case @xmath24  we again have the same alternative scenarios for diffusive instabilities .",
    "some specific properties of the second instability mechanism are easier to characterize in the reduction .",
    "in particular we find that the second scenario is different from a standard turing - type instability as in this case the concentration of activated gtpase in a single spot ( most typical in most examples of cell polarization ) is always preferred independent of variations in the parameter values .",
    "this robustness makes the second instability mechanism an even more attractive explanation for polarization . in section [ sec : numericsfull ] we present numerical simulations for specific versions both of the full system  and of the reduced system .",
    "the simulations confirm the instability criteria derived for the linearised system and allow to investigate the time - evolution after the onset of heterogeneities and beyond the regime governed by the linearization .",
    "it turns out that even for simple choices of the constitutive relations @xmath9 and @xmath11 the system exhibits a rich behavior . in the final section [ sec :",
    "discuss ] we discuss the results of the paper and in particular comment on the term ` diffuse instability ' in the present context and with respect to the second instability mechanism .",
    "the most specific property of the model considered here is the coupling of bulk and surface reaction  diffusion systems .",
    "such coupled systems often arise in cell biology where enzymatic processes on intracellular membranes play a role , see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "bulk reaction  diffusion or convection  diffusion systems also arise in the modeling of surfactants on two - fluid interfaces @xcite .",
    "coupled surface ",
    "bulk systems have been studied intensively over the last decades by numerical simulations , see for example @xcite and the references therein .",
    "+ in @xcite a model that is similar to ours and that describes a two - variable diffusion system in a volume coupled to a reaction system on the boundary has been studied .",
    "here the authors provide numerical simulations and a linear stability analysis .",
    "they show the existence of turing instabilities in their model , even for equal bulk diffusion constants .",
    "the main difference to our model is that in @xcite both activator and substrate diffuse in the bulk and that no diffusion on the membrane surface is considered .",
    "we consider in the following the spatially coupled reaction  diffusion system  for spherical cell shapes and investigate the possibility of diffusive instabilities of a homogeneous stationary state . because of the different domains of definition of @xmath22 and @xmath20 we can not apply standard conditions for ( in)stability and therefore will derive appropriate criteria in this section .",
    "similar to a classical turing instability we consider a spatially homogeneous stationary state and require that this state is ( a ) stable against perturbations of the membrane quantities @xmath20 that are spatially homogeneous _ on the membrane _ and perturbations of the bulk variable @xmath22 that are radially symmetric ( this additional restriction follows already by the first ) and ( b ) unstable with respect to general perturbations .",
    "such property represents a diffusive instability and a symmetry breaking in the sense that the radially symmetric evolution loses its stability as it approaches such a stationary point .    for the constitutive relations @xmath25 we assume that @xmath26 which are for the application to the gtpase cycle natural conditions with respect to the interpretation of @xmath9 as activation rate and @xmath11 as the flux induced by ad- and desorption of gtpase at the membrane . as we are interested in symmetry breaking we consider in the following a spatially homogeneous stationary state @xmath27 of  , which is equivalent to the conditions @xmath28 for convenience we introduce the following notation , @xmath29 we assume that in @xmath30 we have strict inequalities @xmath31    the linearization of  in @xmath30 is given by the system @xmath32 for unknowns @xmath33 , @xmath34 , together with a constraint on the initial conditions , due to the mass conservation property , @xmath35 in the following we assume that no inner membranes are present and assume a spherical shape of the cell , i.e. we choose @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "this allows in the subsequent stability analysis to use separated variables : we introduce polar coordinates and represent @xmath38 as @xmath39 with @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "we further fix an orthonormal basis @xmath41 of @xmath42 given by spherical harmonics with @xmath43 and remark that @xmath44 is constant on @xmath2 .",
    "we then consider the following ansatz for solution of the linearized system  , @xmath45 with @xmath46 , @xmath47\\to { \\mathbb{r}}$ ] , @xmath48 ( for a similar approach see @xcite ) .",
    "we deduce from  , by taking the @xmath42 scalar product with @xmath49 , @xmath50 from we obtain that @xmath51 and @xmath52 is either identically zero or does nowhere vanish .    in the following we first restrict ourselves to the case @xmath53 .",
    "we deduce that @xmath54 if in addition @xmath55 , the latter equation implies that @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes the respective modified bessel functions of first kind .",
    "+ in the case @xmath58 we obtain instead @xmath59    we derive from , , and the linear ode system @xmath60 coupled to an algebraic equation @xmath61 that determines in the case @xmath53 together with the value of @xmath62 .",
    "the linear stability analysis then reduces to an analysis of the eigenvalue equation coupled to an algebraic condition .",
    "we obtain that an eigenvalue @xmath63 with nonnegative real part exists if and only if first @xmath64 and second @xmath62 satisfies @xmath65 with @xmath66 where the last equality follows for @xmath67 from and for @xmath58 from and below .    in the case",
    "@xmath68 , which is equivalent to @xmath69 , the system  is overdetermined .",

    "subset of the parameter space .",
    "therefore this case can not contribute to a robust mechanism .",

    "to discretize in time we use a semi - implicit euler scheme with all nonlinearities linearized corresponding to a single newton step .",
    "we choose a computational domain @xmath240 containing @xmath219 , and we use an adaptively refined mesh in order to discretize system  in space using linear finite elements . on the boundary @xmath241",
    "we assume periodicity of the discrete solutions @xmath242 . due to the degeneracy of equations  and to avoid numerical problems we regularize  in all second order terms by adding a small positive number @xmath243 to @xmath233 .",
    "the resulting linear system of equations is solved by a stabilized bi - conjugate gradient method ( bicgstab ) for @xmath244 in each time step .",

    "we have analytically and numerically studied a coupled system of surface ",
    "bulk reaction ",
    "diffusion equations .",
    "such a system for example arises in @xcite as a model for the gtpase cycle in biological cells . here",
    "the relevant quantities are the concentrations @xmath20 of active and inactive gtpase on the membrane , and the concentration @xmath22 of inactive gtpase in the cytosolic volume .",
    "our main interest here was to analyze the possibility of a symmetry breaking .",
    "the latter refers to an instability of spatially homogeneous stationary points that are stable with respect to symmetry - conserving perturbations , which in our case means that @xmath20 , and the boundary values of @xmath22 are spatially homogeneous .",
    "for spherical cell shapes we have performed a linearized stability analysis and have discovered that two different mechanisms for symmetry breaking are present .",
    "the first one requires a large difference in the lateral diffusion constants of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , expressed by a large value of @xmath254 in . this mechanism is closely related to a classical turing instability for a two - variable system with @xmath17 as activator and @xmath18 as substrate .",
    "the second mechanism however does even occur for equal lateral diffusion constants of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , i.e. even for @xmath21 , which is much more realistic in the application to the gtpase cycle in cells .",
    "this second mechanism on the other hand requires that the cytosolic diffusion coefficient @xmath156 is much larger than the lateral diffusion coefficients .",
    "the simulations show that a factor of @xmath255 between both is sufficient , which is about the ratio between cytosolic and lateral membrane diffusion measured for biological cells @xcite .",
    "the new second instability mechanism is much closer to a turing type mechanism in the @xmath256 variables and is a specific property of coupled surface ",
    "bulk reaction  diffusion systems .",
    "our results for the fully coupled system are comparable to those for its non - local reduction in the infinite cytosolic diffusion limit",
    ". however , here the corresponding stability analysis applies to more general membrane shapes and the reduction allows to further illuminate the two instability mechanisms .",
    "we in particular observe that for @xmath21 in the new second mechanism the most unstable perturbation is always in direction of eigenvectors corresponding to the smallest nonzero eigenvalue .",
    "this prefers the formation of a single membrane component with high concentration of activated gtpase .",
    "again , this is much more in coincidence with the experimentally observed behavior than a classical turing mechanism , where the emerging patterns are typically very sensitive to parameter changes .",
    "we remark that the same robust localization into a single spot has also been observed in @xcite in a related model for the gtpase cycle .",
    "the distinction between the two mechanisms is expressed by the inequalities and .",
    "as observed in remark [ rem : stab - ode ] the latter implies that for case 2 instabilities the spatially homogeneous state is unstable with respect to spatially heterogeneous perturbations even in the absence of membrane diffusion .",
    "it is important to notice that in the full and in the reduced model there is a difference between ( a ) the stability with respect to perturbations that are spatially homogeneous on the cell membrane ( and radially symmetric in the cell ) , and ( b ) the stability ( with respect to not necessarily spatially homogeneous perturbations ) of the corresponding systems without membrane diffusion . for local reaction ",
    "diffusion systems such a difference is not present and there is a coincidence between diffusive instabilities and symmetry breaking . since for our models and a case 2 instability the symmetric state is even without membrane diffusion unstable the term ` diffusion induced instability ' might appear inappropriate .",
    "on the other hand , as explained above , the instability origins from the large cytosolic diffusion compared to the lateral diffusion and is in this respect diffusion induced .",
    "the main property of both a case 1 and a case 2 instability is that we observe a symmetry breaking , which is clearly confirmed by our numerical simulations .",
    "starting from a spatially homogeneous distribution , as long as no stationary point is reached , the system is driven by the kinetic reaction and sorption terms and spatial heterogeneities are not amplified .",
    "if the evolution approaches a homogenous stationary state ( and this typically requires its stability with respect to spatially homogeneous perturbations ) and if this state is unstable with respect to general perturbations then heterogeneous pattern develop and a symmetry breaking occurs .",
    "when the evolution moves away from the stationary point the nonlinear effects again come into play and determine the long - time behavior .",
    "here we recall the formulation of the reaction  diffusion model for the gtpase cycle proposed in @xcite .",
    "we give specific choices of reaction and attachment / detachment laws , and the dimensional formulation including all physical units .",
    "as above we denote the cytosolic volume of a cell by @xmath4 and the cell membrane by the boundary @xmath173 of @xmath4 , which is assumed to represent a smooth , closed two - dimensional surface .",
    "in addition , we fix a time interval of observation @xmath257 .",
