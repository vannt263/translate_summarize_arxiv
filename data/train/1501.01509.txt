    "<S> after some transient dynamics , we often find patterns that do not change qualitatively any more on longer time scales . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in certain parameter regimes , we find nontrivial stationary patterns .        a typical final pattern of a simulation with large @xmath40 is shown in fig .  [ fig : spiral - patterns - and - length - scale]a </S>",

    "<S> it consists of many vortex - like `` singularities '' , where the phase changes by @xmath41 when going around in a closed loop . </S>",

    "<S> spiral patterns in general are well - known as a recurring motif in pattern formation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since they form an important part of the patterns we observe , we now briefly discuss the properties of isolated spirals , produced from an initial condition with a vortex in the phase field ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spiral - patterns - and - length - scale]b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it is known that in related models , there is a transition from stationary spirals to non - stationary spirals , i.e. a situation when the spiral centers are no longer phase - locked to the bulk of the lattice @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have discovered that this transition also gives rise to a jump in the width of the spiral arms , @xmath37 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spiral - patterns - and - length - scale ] ) . outside of the jump , @xmath37 increases with increasing @xmath42 and @xmath40 ( black curve in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spiral - patterns - and - length - scale]d ) . when sweeping the parameter ratio @xmath40 up and down , we find hysteresis in the spiral arm width ( blue line in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : spiral - patterns - and - length - scale]d ) . the precise value at which the jump occurs can then depend on the parameter sweep rate . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis illustrates that the microscopic details of the spiral center , on the scale of a few lattice sites , influence both the spiral arm width and the macroscopic pattern considerably . because the structure of the spiral core is complicated , we can not provide an analytical prediction for @xmath37 </S>",
    "<S> .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to the statistical properties of the patterns which evolve out of random initial conditions ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : spiral - patterns - and - length - scale]a ) , as they are directly relevant for experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial correlations of the phase field are characterized by the correlator @xmath43 , whose distance dependence is displayed in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : spiral - patterns - and - length - scale]c . </S>",
    "<S> we find an oscillatory structure connected to the presence of spiral arms . on top of that , there is an exponential decay , due to the presence of many randomly located spiral centers . </S>",
    "<S> the position of the first minimum in the oscillations indicates the distance approximately set by half a spiral arm width . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of this distance on the parameter @xmath40 is shown as the red line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spiral - patterns - and - length - scale]d . </S>",
    "<S> again , we find a sudden jump associated with the transition from stationary to non - stationary spiral centers . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the spiral arm width @xmath37 determined for isolated spirals does not agree completely with the length scale extracted from the oscillations of the correlator . the difference can be traced back to changes in the spiral core produced by the presence of other nearby spirals .    </S>",
    "<S> there are only two dimensionless parameters , @xmath40 and @xmath42 , that determine the properties of the final pattern . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a complete overview of the various regimes in our model is provided by the `` pattern phase diagram '' in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pattern - phase - diagram ] . </S>",
    "<S> this summarizes the main results of our studies , and we now explain its features .    the transition discussed above , between stationary and non - stationary spirals , </S>",
    "<S> is sharp and can be traced up to intermediate values of @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find two classes of non - stationary spirals : `` pulsating '' spirals , where the core keeps orbiting in a small circle around a fixed location @xcite , and truly mobile spirals that move through the whole lattice . we will comment on their dynamics later . </S>",
    "<S> we have not observed a sharp transition between the two regimes ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pattern - phase - diagram ] ) . at larger @xmath42 , </S>",
    "<S> the transition is directly from stationary to mobile spirals .    </S>",
    "<S> when decreasing the parameter @xmath40 even further , we find a crossover to `` fluctuating '' patterns , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pattern - phase - diagram]c . </S>",
    "<S> these are non - stationary patterns with a complicated phase structure on the scale of the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> for the special case @xmath27 , the location of the crossover ( around @xmath44 ) matches the result obtained in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the crucial macroscopic length scale of the hopf - kuramoto model , i.e. the spiral arm width , grows with increasing @xmath42 . in view of that , it is surprising to see microscopic structures appearing at larger values of this parameter . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we find a sharp transition from the domain of `` stationary spirals '' to stationary patterns that contain `` @xmath45-defects '' , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pattern - phase - diagram]d . </S>",
    "<S> these are point defects which are offset by a phase difference of roughly @xmath45 from the smooth surrounding phase field . </S>",
    "<S> the stability of a single @xmath45-defect on a homogeneous background can be analyzed by semi - analytical linear stability analysis ( in the limit @xmath46 ; for details , see the sm ) , which gives the critical value @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> this defines the asymptote for the transition line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pattern - phase - diagram ] . above the critical value , the @xmath45-defect patterns form a fixed point of the dynamics and can be reached from random initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the pure spiral patterns , these patterns resolve the structure of the lattice and hence form a fundamentally different phase . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , they can not appear in the continuum model , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : omkm_cont ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> when increasing the parameter value @xmath42 further , the density of @xmath45-defects increases until we observe a smooth transition to `` complex '' patterns . </S>",
    "<S> these are stationary patterns with a complicated phase structure on the scale of the lattice , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pattern - phase - diagram]e .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that the white region in the phase diagram could not be accessed due to the significant increase of timescales . </S>",
    "<S> apart from that , we have discussed all phases in the hopf - kuramoto model , for positive parameters . </S>",
    "<S> changing the sign of @xmath25 or @xmath48 will not give qualitatively different results : the emerging patterns can be reconstructed from the patterns discussed above by the transformations @xmath49 for a sign change of @xmath25 , and @xmath50/2 ( `` checkerboard gauge '' ) for a sign change of @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> this works for all values of @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> however , changing the sign of @xmath19 will lead to different patterns . </S>",
    "<S> these involve structure on the scale of the lattice , where phase differences of roughly @xmath51 play an important role . </S>",
    "<S> we will not discuss these patterns , because for coupled hopf oscillators @xmath19 is positive .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to a more detailed discussion of the spiral motion and interaction ( see also @xcite for the continuum case , at @xmath27 ) . </S>",
    "<S> whenever we observe mobile spirals , a fraction of the spirals and anti - spirals eventually annihilate . in some cases , they can also be created dynamically . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the spirals move through the array almost independent of one another for small @xmath42 , whereas they tend to move in pairs for larger values of this parameter . </S>",
    "<S> for large values of @xmath42 , mobile and stationary spirals can even coexist , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spiral - movement ] . depending on initial conditions </S>",
    "<S> , the final state can then be non - stationary or stationary ( if all mobile spirals annihilate ) .     </S>",
    "<S> after a ( long ) integration time @xmath52 mobile spiral centers are visible as local inhomogeneities in @xmath26 . some stationary spirals ( not visible ) exist in the uniform regions . </S>",
    "<S> parameters are @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding phase field is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pattern - phase - diagram]f . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) spiral positions at time @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the lines are the spiral trajectories ( from @xmath55 to @xmath54 ; the trajectories have been slightly smoothened for clarity ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) spiral dynamics of a single spiral over a longer period of time . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that the spiral remains fixed for some time before starting to move again ( this is usually induced via a kick by a nearby mobile spiral ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spiral preferably moves in the cartesian directions set by the lattice.[fig : spiral - movement ] ]    there is also a parameter regime where @xmath45-defects , stationary and mobile spirals can all be present and interact : upon the annihilation of a spiral - anti - spiral pair , a @xmath45-defect can be left behind . </S>",
    "<S> this happens more often for larger values of @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> when a mobile spiral approaches a @xmath45-defect , it can induce the dissolution of the defect into a spiral - anti - spiral pair . </S>",
    "<S> however , the mobile spiral can also move across the defect and make it vanish . </S>",
    "<S> all these interactions play an important role even at late times .    </S>",
    "<S> experimental studies of the patterns discussed in this work could be implemented by direct local electrical readout of the motion in electrically coupled nanomechanical resonator arrays @xcite , or by optical readout of the motion in future optomechanical arrays @xcite based on optomechanical crystals @xcite or other platforms . </S>",
    "<S> the latter consist of an array of localized mechanical modes , each of them coupled to one localized optical mode , driven by a laser . </S>",
    "<S> the model parameters could be tuned by varying the laser power and detuning . </S>",
    "<S> simulations of single optomechanical cells , where we extracted the phenomenological parameters @xmath4 , @xmath3 and @xmath56 , suggest that all the important regions of the pattern phase diagram could be explored . near the hopf bifurcation </S>",

    "<S> furthermore , @xmath60 holds as well for sufficient coupling @xmath9 , when @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> the motion can be read out by observing the light scattered from the sample . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity of the light scattered with wave vector transfer @xmath62 is related to the structure factor ( see sm ) , i.e. the spatial fourier transform ( at @xmath62 ) of the phase correlator @xmath63 . in a typical experiment , </S>",
    "<S> the frequencies will be disordered , but first simulations ( with standard deviation @xmath64 ) do not show qualitative changes of the patterns we discussed . </S>",
    "<S> however , initially mobile spirals could be pinned at sites with lower frequencies @xcite .    the variety of patterns summarized in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pattern - phase - diagram ] are important for synchronization dynamics and applications . </S>",
    "<S> for example , finite phase - differences across the array ( in stationary patterns ) will reduce the total power output of the collective oscillator , and the mere presence of spirals can reduce the robustness against noise @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finite frequency - differences ( in non - stationary patterns ) reduce the frequency stability . tuning the parameters into suitable regions will optimize the array s properties . </S>",
    "<S> future theoretical studies of the hopf - kuramoto model could include noise , which may lead to interesting effects , as discussed for similar models in @xcite . </S>",
