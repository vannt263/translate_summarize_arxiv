    "brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) are amongst the largest , most massive and most luminous galaxies in the universe . often found close to the centre of the cluster that they inhabit , bcgs are generally easy to identify , even in the most distant clusters that are currently known .",
    "they are also easy to identify in large n - body simulations , thus allowing us the opportunity to directly compare , for a single class of galaxy , the predictions of numerical simulations with observations .    in the hierarchical scenario for",
    "the formation of structure in our universe , bcgs build up their stellar mass over time by converting material accreted from their surroundings into stars and by merging with other galaxies . over the range of redshifts that we can observe bcgs ,",
    "the stellar mass of the average bcg is expected to increase significantly with time through merging with other galaxies .",
    "for example , in the semi - analytic model described in @xcite , the stellar mass increases by a factor of four between redshift @xmath4 and today .",
    "observationally , it appears that the growth is slightly slower than the predictions of the @xcite model . from a sample of 150 bcgs",
    ", @xcite found that the stellar mass of bcgs increases by a factor 1.8 over the redshift interval @xmath5 to @xmath1 .",
    "this result differs from that of earlier works , which generally found little or no change over the same redshift interval @xcite . in part",
    ", this was due to the way the positive correlation between the mass of the cluster and the stellar mass of the bcg @xcite tends to dilute the observed evolution .",
    "the distant clusters used in these samples were more massive than the likely progenitors of clusters in the low - redshift comparison samples .",
    "the distant clusters therefore tended to have more massive bcgs to start with .",
    "more recent models @xcite predict that bcgs should increase their stellar mass by a factor of 1.9 between @xmath4 and @xmath6 , an increase that is lower than that reported in earlier simulations @xcite .",
    "the theoretical expectation and the observations are now in excellent agreement .",
    "the new models also predict that the growth occurs through a combination of minor and major mergers to define a major merger , where @xmath7 is the mass ratio between the satellite and its more massive companion . ] and that the size of bcgs should increase dramatically as they grow in mass .",
    "observational support for the notion that bcgs build up their stellar mass by merging has been steadily increasing over the past few years . from a sample of 91 bcgs at @xmath8",
    ", @xcite found that bcgs increase their mass by as much as 10% over 0.5gyr . both minor and major mergers",
    "are thought to play a role , with major mergers contributing somewhere between half @xcite to substantially more than half @xcite of the mass .",
    "direct evidence for merging , through tidal tails and distorted isophotes , has been found by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated that 3.5% of bcgs in the redshift interval @xmath9 show evidence for an ongoing merger .",
    "@xcite found a similar fraction and estimated that the centres of groups and clusters are increasing their mass at a rate of 2 - 9% per gyr .",
    "once signs of a merger are evident , the timescale for merging is short , of the order of a few crossing times , which is typically around 0.2gyr for galaxies that are within 30kpc of the bcg .",
    "the amount of mass accreted through mergers by bcgs in distant clusters , i.e.  those at @xmath10 , is largely unconstrained .",
    "a measurement of the mass accreted by high redshift bcgs can be combined with the measurements at low redshift , and allow us to estimate the mass accreted through mergers from redshift 1 to today .    in this paper , we combine high - quality ground - based near - ir images of a sample of 18 distant galaxy clusters with extensive spectroscopy to examine the possibility that major mergers between the brightest galaxies within the core of the cluster and the bcg contribute significantly to the growth of the stellar mass of the bcg between @xmath11 and today . in sec .",
    "[ sec : data ] , we introduce the sample that we use in the analysis , which includes new high - resolution data taken with the hawk - i camera on the very large telescope ( vlt ) .",
    "since much of the hawk - i data have not been published before and since we will make these data public , we provide a detailed description of how the these data were taken and processed . after expanding the work presented in @xcite by adding new measurements to the rest - frame k - band magnitude - redshift relation in sec .",
    "[ sec : hubble ] , we use the radial distribution of over 600 spectroscopically confirmed cluster galaxies , both bright and faint , to argue in sec .",
    "[ sec : companions ] that there is an excess of bright galaxies close to the bcg .",
    "we then estimate the timescale for the brighter galaxies to merge with the bcg and then infer how many close companions we should have seen if major merging is the dominant process for the build - up of stellar mass in bcgs . in the final two sections of the paper , we discuss and summarise our main results .    throughout the paper , all magnitudes and colours",
    "are measured in the observer frame and are placed on the 2mass photometric system .",
    "vega magnitudes are used throughout .",
    "we also assume a flat cold dark matter cosmology with @xmath12 and @xmath13 kms@xmath14mpc@xmath14 .",
    "the sample of clusters we use in this paper is built from several surveys .",
    "ten clusters come from sparcsgillianw / sparcs/]@xcite . in brief",
    ", the sparcs clusters were discovered by searching for over - densities in the number of red galaxies using images taken with irac on the spitzer space telescope and ground - based z - band images taken with either megacam on the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) or mosaic ii on the cerro tololo blanco telescope .",
    "additional details on individual clusters can be found in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "all ten clusters from sparcs were also part of gclassgillianw / gclass/ ] , a spectroscopic survey that used the multi - object spectroscopic ( mos ) modes of gmos - n and gmos - s on the gemini telescopes to obtain between 20 and 80 spectroscopically confirmed members per cluster @xcite .",
    "the comprehensive spectroscopic coverage provided by gclass allows us to identify the brightest cluster members in each of the clusters , and to exclude foreground and background galaxies that might be confused as cluster members .",
    "it is for this reason that we do not add the two sparcs clusters at @xmath15 in @xcite to the sample .",
    "the number of spectroscopically confirmed cluster members is currently around a dozen for both clusters , although work to increase this number significantly is currently underway .",
    "complementing the comprehensive spectroscopic coverage are ground - based images in the optical ( u , g , r , i and z ) and near - ir ( j and ks ) , images in each of the irac passbands ( [ 3.6 ] , [ 4.5 ] , [ 5.8 ] and [ 8 ] ) , and for some clusters , images with mips .",
    "the near - ir data are described in @xcite , while the optical data are described in van der berg et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "the remaining clusters were discovered either through their x - ray emission or as over - densities of red galaxies .",
    "most of these clusters were observed with hawk - i as part of the hawk - i cluster survey , which we describe in greater detail in the following section .",
    "all clusters are listed in table  [ tab : clustersample ] .",
    "the redshift range covered by the sample extends from z=0.84 to z=1.46 .      during 2005 and 2006 ,",
    "the supernova cosmology project ( scp ) targeted 25 galaxy clusters in the redshift range @xmath16 with the acscamera on hstwith the purpose of finding distant type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) .",
    "the survey was called the hst cluster supernova survey , and is described in @xcite . given the relatively small fields - of - view that are available with hst and the high surface density of potential hosts in distant clusters ,",
    "distant clusters are an efficient way of finding distant sne ia @xcite .",
    "clusters for the hst cluster supernova survey were selected from the irac shallow cluster survey @xcite , the red - sequence cluster surveys ( rcs and rcs-2 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the xmm cluster survey @xcite , the palomar distant cluster survey @xcite , the xmm - newton distant cluster project @xcite , and the rosat deep cluster survey ( rdcs , * ? ? ?",
    "at the time the hst cluster supernova survey was conducted , the sample represented a significant fraction of the known @xmath17 clusters .",
    "the spectroscopic follow - up of supernovae in these clusters was done with fors2 on the vlt , lris on keck and focas on subaru .",
    "details on the follow - up can be found in @xcite and @xcite . in most cases ,",
    "the mos mode was used , which allowed one to obtain the redshifts of many cluster members in addition to that of the host of the supernova or the supernova itself .",
    "some clusters , such as xmmu  1229 @xcite , produced several sne , which meant that they were targeted multiple times , thereby leading to many redshifts .",
    "many of the clusters in the hst cluster supernova survey have been observed at other wavelengths .",
    "this includes longer wavelength data taken with irac and mips on the spitzer space telescope and , for a few clusters , data from the herschel space observatory . this broad coverage , together with",
    "the large number of spectroscopically confirmed cluster members in each cluster means that these clusters are an ideal sample for studying the properties of galaxies in distant clusters .",
    "lacking , however , were high - quality near - ir data that matched the depth of the data taken in space .",
    "this was the driving reason for observing many of these clusters with hawk - i on the vlt in a survey that we refer to in the rest of the paper as the hawk - i cluster survey ( hcs ) .",
    "clusters for the hcs were selected from those targeted in the hst cluster supernova survey according to two criteria :    * they were visible from the paranal observatory * there were at least 10 spectroscopically confirmed members per cluster    to this list , we added rx  j0152.7 - 1357 ( hereafter , rx  0152 ) a x - ray discovered cluster at z=0.84 that has over 100 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members @xcite and deep acs imaging @xcite .",
    "six of the nine clusters were discovered from their x - ray emission .",
    "one of these , xlss  0223 , was independently discovered as an overdensity of galaxies in images taken with irac @xcite .",
    "the remainder were discovered as over - densities of red - sequence galaxies in the red - sequence cluster survey ( rcs , * ? ? ?",
    "the complete list of 19 clusters , which includes the clusters from sparcs , the method by which they were discovered , their redshifts , and a list of selected references are listed in table  [ tab : clustersample ] .",
    "also listed are the abbreviated names that we use throughout the text .    [ cols=\"<,<,>,<,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      in sec  [ sec : companions ] , we excluded four clusters because the bcg was more than 250kpc from the luminosity  weighted centres of the clusters .",
    "one of the excluded clusters was rx  0152 .    as noted earlier , rx  0152 consists of at least three dynamically distinct clumps @xcite .",
    "the bcg is not centered in any of the clumps : instead , it is centered about 35  ( 270kpc ) north - east of the northern clump .",
    "closer inspection of the galaxies that are centred in the two biggest clumps reveals that both have bright , nearby companions , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rx0152 ] .",
    "( 512,256 )   ( -495,50 ) ( -245,50 )    both galaxies in the northern clump are cluster members .",
    "they are separated by 12kpc and differ in velocity by 280km / s .",
    "they almost have the same brightness , differing in ks band flux by only 1% . using the arguments presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : companions ] , it is likely that these galaxies will merge within a few 100myr . if these galaxies do merge and if all of the mass stays in the descendent of the merger , then the descendent will become the brightest galaxy in the cluster .",
    "intriguingly , in the deep hawk - i data , there appears to be material possibly extending from this pair to the north - east .",
    "the material is also visible in the acs image .",
    "it may be a background arc , although the orientation is more radial than tangential , or it could be material from a third galaxy that is in the process of being destroyed by its two much more massive companions .",
    "the central region in the southern clump is actually a triplet of galaxies , consisting of a pair of cluster members that are 20kpc apart and a 3rd galaxy that is only 3.5kpc from the brightest galaxy in the triplet , which was the galaxy chosen as the bcg in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have a redshift for the 3rd galaxy .",
    "however , as noted in nantais et al .",
    "( in preparation ) , the third galaxy in the acs images appears to be very compact when compared to cluster galaxies of similar brightness .",
    "this is indicative of an ongoing merger .",
    "the halo of the galaxy has been stripped by its brighter neighbour .",
    "the redshifts of the other two galaxies are , within the errors , identical , which means that the relative velocity of the galaxies differ by less than 100km / s",
    ". these two galaxies could also merge within a few 100myr .",
    "if all three galaxies were to merge and if there was no subsequent star - formation , then the brightness of the resulting galaxy would be comparable to the brightness of what is now the bcg .",
    "a number of studies have estimated the number of bright galaxies that are close to bcgs in nearby galaxy clusters . @xcite",
    "estimated that about 49 bcgs out of a sample of 515 bcgs in the redshift interval @xmath18 have a companion that is i ) within a projected distance of 7 to 30 kpc of the bcg and ii ) within 2 mag of the sdss r - band magnitude of the bcg .",
    "they apply a further restriction , which applies to both the bcg and its companion . the g - r colour of both galaxies must be greater than 0.7 .",
    "the criteria adopted by @xcite are broadly similar to the ones used in this paper .",
    "they find that 1 bcg in 10 have a bright nearby companion , whereas we find that 3 bcgs in 14 have a nearby bright companion .",
    "the number of companions in our more distant clusters is higher ; however , given the small number of clusters in the high redshift sample , it is premature to cite this as strong evidence that the number of bright nearby companions to bcgs in distant clusters is increasing with redshift .",
    "we return to this point in the following section .",
    "@xcite then go on to examine the number of bcgs that show direct evidence of merging with their nearby companion . evidence of a merger includes tidal tails , distorted isophotes , and broad fans . out of 49 close pairs , 18 or one - third show evidence for a merger taking place .",
    "while we again stress that the number of bcgs in our high - redshift sample is small , one of our three pairs , the pair in rdcs  1252 , shows evidence for a merger .",
    "@xcite estimate that bcgs are increasing their stellar mass at a rate of 2.5% @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the timescale for the merger to take place and @xmath21 is the fraction of companion s stellar mass that is accreted onto the bcg . in a separate study ,",
    "@xcite find that bcgs at @xmath22 are adding as much as 10% of their stellar mass through mergers , both minor and major , over 0.5gyr , which is considerably higher than the rate in @xcite .",
    "however , recall that @xcite only include cases where there is direct evidence of a merger and only major mergers .",
    "the two results differ because of the broader definition of potential mergers and the broader mass range used in @xcite .",
    "they also probe different redshifts .    in our study of 14 high redshift clusters , we find that bcgs are accreting mass at a rate of 7% @xmath23 .",
    "this estimate assumes that half of the mass of the companion is accreted onto the bcg and half is distributed more broadly throughout the cluster .",
    "our rate is higher than that inferred by @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is lower than the rate computed for low redshift clusters in @xcite ; however , we do not include minor mergers , whereas @xcite do , so part of the difference is in part due to the broader mass range used in @xcite .",
    "while our sample is too small to test for a change in the major merger rate with redshift , it is clear that major mergers are occurring at @xmath11 and that the rate is comparable to the rate at lower redshifts . if major mergers contribute as much mass as minor mergers , and n - body simulations suggest that they contribute more @xcite , then major mergers are not only an important mechanism for the build up of stellar at @xmath24 , they are an important mechanism between @xmath24 and today .    theoretically , one would expect major mergers to be more common at higher redshifts .",
    "the accretion rate for massive clusters peaks between @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xcite , and as clusters get larger , the dynamical friction timescale for galaxies of a given mass increases , so it takes longer for a galaxy to sink into the core .",
    "for these reasons , one would expect bcgs to experience fewer major mergers at lower redshifts .",
    "we now compare our results with the results from models .",
    "@xcite use semi - empirical models to estimate the major merger lies within the range @xmath27 . ]",
    "rate as a function of stellar mass and redshift . at @xmath10",
    ", they find that the major merger rate per galaxy varies between @xmath28 to @xmath29gyr@xmath14 for galaxies with stellar masses between @xmath30 and @xmath31 . the merger rate increases quickly with stellar mass and with redshift .",
    "this mass range covers the range of stellar masses of the bcgs in our sample , which varies between @xmath32 and @xmath33 , with a median mass of @xmath34 .",
    "our bcgs vary in redshift from @xmath35 to @xmath36 , with a median of @xmath37 .",
    "if we use the more restrictive definition of what constitutes a major merger used in @xcite , we find that 2 out of 14 of the bcgs in our sample  the 3rd galaxy has a mass ratio 0.327 , and therefore just fails to meet the more restrictive definition  are likely to experience a major merger within 600myr .",
    "this translates to a rate of 0.25 major mergers per gyr , which is fully consistent with the rates derived in @xcite . using the broader definition that we have used throughout the paper",
    ", we find a rate of 0.4 major mergers per gyr .    as noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : low - z ] , we find a higher fraction of bright nearby companions in our sample than others have found in samples at lower redshifts .",
    "we find them to be about a factor of about two more common . over the stellar mass range covered by the bcgs in our sample ,",
    "@xcite find that the major merger rate increases between @xmath38 and @xmath39 by a factor that varies between 2 and 4 .",
    "this is consistent to what we infer from observations .",
    "while there is consistency between models and observations , one needs to be mindful of potential biases that come from the way clusters are selected at low and high redshifts .",
    "the clusters in our sample are some of the most massive clusters that we know of at these high redshifts . by today",
    ", they would have increased in mass significantly , from a median mass of @xmath40 at @xmath41 to a median mass of @xmath42 . by today",
    ", the average cluster in our sample of high redshift clusters would be more massive than the average cluster in the sample used in , for example , @xcite .",
    "since the properties of the bcg correlates with the properties of the cluster in which it lives ( e.g.  more massive clusters have more massive bcgs ) , it is not unreasonable to expect that the major merger rate does too .",
    "comparing this rate in cluster samples that span different mass ranges may lead to a biased view of how this rate changes with redshift .",
    "currently our samples are too small to explore how significant this bias may be .",
    "we combine 10 distant clusters from sparcs with the 9 clusters of the hawk - i cluster survey to build a sample of 19 galaxy clusters between @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "our sample contains over 600 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members .",
    "we use this sample to examine the frequency of bright cluster members that are likely to merge with the bcg within 600myr .    after excluding one cluster because of the uncertainty in identifying the bcg  due to the chance projection of a much nearer face - on spiral galaxy close to the cluster core  and four others because the bcgs are located more than 250kpc from the cluster centres , we find that 3 of the 14 bcgs are likely to experience a major merger within 600myr .",
    "while the statistical uncertainty stemming from the small number of clusters in our sample is large , the number of mergers is similar to the number of mergers that are predicted by theory and to the number that would be needed to build the stellar mass of bcgs by a factor of @xmath43 between redshift @xmath44 and @xmath6 , under the assumptions that major mergers contribute most of the accreted stellar mass and that half of the mass of the companion is accreted onto the bcg .",
    "the factor of two increase in the stellar mass between redshift @xmath44 and @xmath6 has been measured from observations @xcite and predicted by n - body models @xcite .",
    "the data are consistent with the notion that the majority of the stellar mass that is accreted onto bcgs between @xmath3 and today comes from major mergers .",
    "however , they do not exclude the possibility that minor mergers could play an important role in shaping how bcgs appear today . in future work",
    "( rettura et al . in preparation ) , we will examine the size of the bcgs in our sample and compare them to bcgs at lower redshifts .",
    "it is expected that major mergers increase the size of the galaxy linearly with the amount of mass accreted , whereas minor mergers are expected to increase the size of the galaxy more quickly than this .",

    "<S> recent independent results from numerical simulations and observations have shown that brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) have increased their stellar mass by a factor of almost two between @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical simulations further suggest that more than half this mass is accreted through major mergers . using a sample of 18 distant galaxy clusters with over 600 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members between them , we search for observational evidence that major mergers do play a significant role . we find a major merger rate of @xmath2 mergers per gyr at @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> . while the uncertainties , which stem from the small size of our sample , are relatively large , our rate is consistent with the results that are derived from numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> if we assume that this rate continues to the present day and that half of the mass of the companion is accreted onto the bcg during these mergers , then we find that this rate can explain the growth in the stellar mass of the bcgs that is observed and predicted by simulations . </S>",
    "<S> major mergers therefore appear to be playing an important role , perhaps even the dominant one , in the build up of stellar mass in these extraordinary galaxies .    </S>",
