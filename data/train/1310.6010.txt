    "when the interface between two fluids of different densities is subjected to rapid acceleration , e.g. by a shock passing through the interface , perturbations present at the interface prior to the passage of the wave grow with time . this phenomenon is known as the richtmyer - meshkov instability ( rm )  @xcite , and has been extensively studied in the last couple of decades , mainly in the field of astrophysics .",
    "recently , a renewed interest in rm was triggered by innovations in magnetized target fusion ( mtf ) .    in this paper",
    "we study the cylindrical collapse of a gas cavity by an imploding liquid shell , where the development of interface instabilities is known to affect the compression efficiency . in this study",
    "we focus on the rm instability  @xcite , which is the first instability to develop on the liquid - gas interface during collapse . the mtf driver in development at general fusion inc . will compress a plasma - filled cylindrical cavity by using pneumatic pistons to initiate a converging pressure wave in molten lead ( _ pb _ ) .",
    "as the pressure wave reaches the liquid - plasma interface , the interface undergoes rapid acceleration and travels toward the center , compressing the plasma cavity . in our prototype device",
    ", the cavity is instead filled with argon gas .",
    "perturbations existing at the liquid - gas interface prior to the passage of the pressure wave may seed the development of hydrodynamic instabilities . in this study , we concentrate on the parameter space relevant to our prototype device so as to define requirements for the smoothness of the initial liquid - gas interface for efficient compression",
    ".    the growth characteristics of initially small - amplitude sinusoidal perturbations can be divided into two regimes : ( i ) the linear regime , in which the contribution of nonlinear effects is negligible and evolution of the disturbance can be adequately described by the linearized equations , and ( ii ) the nonlinear regime , in which the perturbation growth decreases and finally saturates due to nonlinear effects . in the linear regime , initial perturbation growth can be reasonably predicted by the simple impulse models  @xcite as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the initial perturbation amplitude , @xmath3 is the difference in the velocity of the interface before and after the passage of the shock wave , and @xmath4 is the atwood number defined as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the fluid densities .    in literature ,",
    "a characteristic pattern of rm instability is usually described in terms of fingers of one fluid penetrating into another .",
    "a finger of light fluid poking into heavy fluid is usually called a ` bubble ' , and that of heavy into light is called a ` spike ' . bubbles and spikes grow at the same rate during the linear stage .",
    "however during the nonlinear stage , spikes undergo acceleration whereas bubbles tend to stagnate .",
    "the disparity in growth rates becomes more prominent at high atwood numbers ( @xmath8 ) , see e.g. dimonte and ramaprabhu  @xcite , and in this regime a vast majority of the existing models also perform poorly .",
    "once the passing shock wave and the interface begin to interact , the evolution of the initially perturbed interface can be explained in terms of vorticity deposition .",
    "if the interface is perturbed , the pressure gradient of the shock is misaligned with the density gradient across the interface .",
    "this results in generation of the baroclinic vorticity through the term @xmath9 in the vorticity equation .",
    "the sign of the generated vorticity ( clockwise or counter clockwise ) depends on the sign of the atwood number , i.e. whether the shock travels from light fluid to heavy or vice versa  @xcite . as such",
    ", the initial perturbation may grow monotonically or first decrease and then grow in the opposite direction , a phenomenon known as phase inversion  @xcite .",
    "most of the work to date on the rm instability has been carried out in rectangular geometry , with fluids modeled as ideal gases , and at moderate atwood numbers ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "a lot of effort was put into understanding the underlying physics , developing models describing nonlinear stages of disturbance evolution , and investigating the effects of compressibility , sensitivity to the initial conditions , and turbulent mixing , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been an increase in the number of works describing the rm instability in converging geometries  @xcite , which are more relevant to fusion .",
    "the situation in converging geometries is more complex than the planar case , because the trajectories of bubbles and spikes are no longer parallel as the interface moves in the radial direction .",
    "the evolution of small amplitude perturbations in cylindrical geometry was investigated by mikaelian  @xcite for the case of pure azimuthal perturbations .",
    "lombardini  @xcite extended the analysis  @xcite to also account for axial perturbations .    in converging geometries a fair bit of attention is devoted to the secondary effects , such as so - called ` reshock '  @xcite ; in planar geometry ` reshock ' has been studied by  @xcite .",
    "when a shock wave strikes the interface between two fluids , it is partially transmitted into the second fluid and partially reflected .",
    "the transmission ratio depends on the acoustic impedance of each fluid , defined as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the density and sound speed of the fluid , respectively . in a converging geometry",
    "the transmitted part of the shock travels to the origin , which acts as a singular point , and then bounces back to hit the interface again affecting the perturbation growth ; this phenomenon is called ` reshock ' .",
    "one of the aspects of the rm instability that has been given little attention until recently is the regime of high atwood number ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "this situation occurs when a shock wave passes , for example , between a liquid and a gas . in this case , at least one of the fluids can not be described as an ideal gas and other equations of state must be considered . if one of the fluids is a liquid and the shock reflects off the interface , cavitation can occur when the pressure falls below the tensile strength of the liquid , further increasing the complexity of the problem .",

    "their focus was on developing an ejecta source term model that links to the surface perturbations of shocked materials .",
    "the main assumption of their model is that ejecta formation at a metal - vacuum interface can be viewed as a special limiting case of the rm instability .",

    ", we have liquid @xmath15 surrounding a cylindrical cavity of air .",
    "the pressure pulse originates in the liquid and converges toward the liquid - gas interface .",
    "when the pressure pulse reaches the interface , it is almost entirely reflected because of the severe mismatch between the acoustic impedance of liquid @xmath15 and that of air . in this configuration , the reflected wave is a rarefaction wave that subjects the liquid to tension , which may cause cavitation .",

    "propagation of a pressure pulse through the liquid @xmath15 from the outer boundary towards the interface in a cylindrical geometry is shown in figure  [ pulseprop ] .",
    "the pressure pulse has a maximum initial amplitude of @xmath92 gpa and duration @xmath94 @xmath30s .",
    "it can be seen that the pressure pulse is amplified as it cylindrically converges in the @xmath15 .",
    "this amplification is in excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction for a small amplitude ( linear ) pulse that is @xmath104 in cylindrical geometry  @xcite .",
    "( the pulse is expected to exhibit linear behaviour when the particle velocity is much less than the sound speed . ) as the pulse approaches the interface and pressure becomes higher , nonlinearity starts to manifest itself by a steepening of the pulse front and a slight deviation of the amplitude from the theoretical curve .",

    "it is worth reiterating that the imploding material is liquid @xmath15 with an acoustic impedance much larger than the air in the cavity .",
    "therefore , the pressure pulse is almost completely reflected back into the @xmath15 as a rarefaction wave .",
    "the molten lead is then subjected to tension which causes it to cavitate .",
    "it is apparent in fig .",
    "[ ndcollapsefield]b that a @xmath15 shell is formed as a result of interaction between the pressure pulse and the liquid - gas interface . as the shell moves inwards , a cavitation region forms behind it , separating it from the rest of the molten lead .",
    "the pressure contours in fig .",
    "[ ndcollapsefield]c show that the @xmath15 shell becomes pressurized as it converges , while the pressure in the cavitation region falls to the minimum allowed by the numerical setup .",
    "radial profiles of the pressure , velocity and vof at two different instances during the collapse ( @xmath113 @xmath30s and @xmath112 @xmath30s ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ ndcollapseprofiles ] .",
    "we mainly focus on the behaviour of the molten lead as dynamics of the gas bubble has a very little effect on the liquid @xmath15 until the very late stages of the collapse .",
    "vof profiles clearly show the location of the liquid - gas interface and growth of the cavitation region as the interface progresses inwards .",
    "also evident is the increase in the thickness of the @xmath15 shell as it converges during the collapse process . from the pressure profiles we can see that the shell is pressurized as it moves toward the center .",
    "the pressure in the cavitation region becomes almost zero and the pressure inside the air increases as it is compressed .",
    "velocity profiles indicate that the velocity gradually increases towards smaller radii both in the cavitation region and the @xmath15 shell , i.e. the inner edge of the shell is moving faster than its outer edge . during early stages of the collapse",
    ", the interface velocity ( which is equal to the fluid velocity at the position of the interface ) roughly corresponds to eq .",
    "[ eq : velint ] , but later increases due to the converging geometry .",
    "if we look at the flow field structure inside the gas cavity one can observe a shock wave propagating through it .",
    "this shock wave is generated inside the air due to the sudden acceleration of the interface .",
    "the interface is analogous to a piston at rest that suddenly begins moving into a quiescent gas at constant velocity . in this situation , a shock front immediately appears , moving away from the piston with a constant supersonic speed .",
    "ahead of the shock front the gas is at rest , while behind the shock it moves at the same velocity as the piston , i.e. the interface velocity in our case ( see  @xcite @xmath114 ) .",
    "note that our numerical method is not sufficient for a high - accuracy solution of shock wave propagation inside the compressed gas .",
    "however , as mentioned earlier , the gas dynamics has little effect on the collapse therefore current numerical setup is sufficient for this study .",

    "one can see that the duration of the pulse influences the collapse time ; longer pulses compress the cavity faster .",
    "this effect , however , diminishes as the pulse duration is increased , such that no difference in collapse time is observed for pulses with @xmath116 @xmath30s .",
    "our results for the longer pulses are also in a very good agreement with a theoretical solution by kedrinskii  @xcite ) developed for studying underwater explosions .",
    "some additional results concerning the effect of the pressure pulse amplitude as well as collapse characteristics of the initially unperturbed spherical cavity can be found in our earlier work  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that in the current numerical setup the gas never becomes sufficiently pressurized to affect the trajectory of the interface , which accelerates all the way to the axis due to geometrical convergence . in reality , however , the interface undergoes rapid deceleration during the very latest stages of compression because the gas pressure becomes comparable to the pressure in the @xmath15 shell .",
    "this deceleration is very important as the interface becomes rayleigh - taylor unstable during this phase .",
    "now we turn our attention to the development of the rm instability during the collapse due to imperfections that may be present on the liquid - gas interface . in order to understand how various perturbations are going to affect the compression efficiency of our system ,",

    "results are presented for case n12a002 listed in table  [ tab : simlist ] with an initial amplitude of @xmath87 mm and @xmath118 .",
    "one can see that once the pressure pulse interacts with the perturbed liquid - gas interface ( fig .",
    "[ initialevolution ] at @xmath111 ) , vorticity is immediately generated in the vicinity of the interface because of initial misalignment of density and pressure gradients across the interface , i.e. the mechanism of baroclinic vorticity generation . for a pulse passing from a heavy fluid into a light one ,",
    "the deposited vorticity initially acts in the direction opposite to that of the perturbation , smoothing the interface during the early evolution stages ( fig .",
    "[ initialevolution ] at @xmath119 @xmath30s ) .",

    "the asymmetry between the spikes and bubbles observed in fig .",
    "[ initialevolution ] at @xmath121 @xmath30s indicates that the perturbation is entering a nonlinear stage of evolution .",
    "there are two non - dimensional parameters that can be used to characterize evolution of the perturbation amplitude .",
    "the first one is the ratio of the perturbation amplitude and wavelength @xmath122 .",
    "similar to the planar case , perturbation evolution is considered to be linear when @xmath123 . however , in cylindrical geometry the wavelength of the perturbation decreases as the cavity is compressed so that nonlinear effects become prominent earlier .",
    "the second parameter is the ratio between the disturbance amplitude and radius of the cavity @xmath124 .",
    "this parameter indicates how much the perturbation evolution is influenced by the curvature of the interface . for small amplitude",
    "initial disturbances parameter @xmath125 is small . at early stages of the collapse",
    "only low azimuthal modes are expected to be influenced by the curvature of the interface as they have significant ratios of @xmath126 , whereas early evolution of the perturbations at higher azimuthal modes is expected to be similar to that of the planar case . as the cavity continues to be compressed ,",
    "however , the decrease in cavity radius increases the number of modes that are affected by curvature . therefore ,",
    "while the initial motion may be negligibly different from the planar case , we expect convergence effects to manifest themselves at some point during the collapse .    keeping the above in mind we follow the spike evolution in figs .",
    "[ initialevolution ] and [ lateevolution ] .",
    "one can see that after phase inversion is complete ( @xmath120 , 210 , and 312.5 @xmath30s ) , the spike amplitude grows , i.e. the distance increases between the crest of the perturbation and the position of the initially unperturbed interface . at later stages ( @xmath127 , 362.5 , and 375 @xmath30s ) ,",

    "one can also see the kelvin - helmholtz ( k - h ) instability that develops on the sides of the bubbles and spikes at later times @xmath128 @xmath30s , giving them a serrated appearance .",
    "another interesting phenomenon that can be observed in figs .",
    "[ initialevolution ] and [ lateevolution ] is the formation of narrow molten lead jets ( ribs ) originating from the back of the bubble during the latest stages of the collapse ( @xmath127 , 362.5 , and 375 @xmath30s ) .",
    "formation of such jets has been observed in our simulations for perturbations with azimuthal mode numbers higher than four @xmath129 .",
    "the prominence of the jets is dependent on the amplitude and mode of the initial perturbation .",
    "for this example case , the narrow jets only form but do not overtake the original spikes during the collapse . instead",

    "one can see that for the small amplitude initial perturbation ( first row ) no significant nonlinear effects are observed and the spikes and bubbles remain nearly symmetric throughout the time period shown . as the amplitude increases , nonlinear effects begin to manifest themselves in the growing asymmetry between the spikes and bubbles .",
    "the spike appears to accelerate and becomes sharper , whereas the bubble appears to stagnate .",

    "we follow extrema of the perturbation throughout the entire simulation , therefore our notation of ` spike ' and ` bubble ' corresponds to that usually used in the literature from the moment the phase inversion has occurred , as explained earlier in the validation section .",

    "one can see that at @xmath111 , the red and green lines corresponding to the maximum and minimum of the initial perturbation are above and below the radial position of the initially unperturbed interface ( black line ) , respectively , and the difference between those lines defines the amplitude of the initial perturbation @xmath2 .",
    "the perturbation decreases in amplitude until around @xmath132 @xmath30s ( when phase inversion occurs ) and then starts to grow in the opposite direction . from that moment",
    "our notation of spike and bubble matches that commonly used in literature , i.e. a finger of light fluid poking into heavy fluid for a ` bubble ' , and that of heavy into light for a ` spike ' .    at late stages of the collapse",
    "the difference between red and black lines as well as between green and black lines starts to decrease again eventually accompanied by another reversal , which indicates formation of the narrow molten lead jets .",
    "[ typicalintevol ] ( b ) shows the rapid acceleration of the interface resulting from its interaction with the pressure pulse . during early stages of the collapse , the velocities of the spikes , bubbles , and that of the unperturbed interface are nearly constant .",

    "the spikes experience deceleration during late times , leading to a rapid decrease in spike amplitude . by comparing the growth characteristics of spikes and bubbles ,",
    "it is apparent that the bubble amplitude does not scale as well with the initial perturbation amplitude , even early in the collapse .",
    "the bubble amplitude growth is significantly reduced for larger initial perturbations when compared to smaller ones .",

    "[ ampn6](a ) and  [ ampn6](c ) a negative velocity corresponds to the situation in which the perturbed interface ( either spike or bubble ) moves inwards faster than the initially unperturbed interface , whereas a positive velocity indicates that the perturbed interface moves inwards slower than the unperturbed interface ( although it still moves inwards ) .    from the velocity plots",
    "one can see that after some finite initial time required to accelerate the interface from rest ( @xmath135 @xmath30s ) , the velocities of both spikes and bubbles approach a nearly constant value for a little while .",

    "both spikes and bubbles undergo gradual acceleration until late times , when there is rapid deceleration , except for cases with large initial amplitudes in which the spikes reach the axis before this decelerate phase can occur .",
    "for all amplitudes under consideration , the bubble growth rate scales well with initial bubble velocity until the collapse is well underway .",
    "the spike growth rate also scales well , except for large amplitude perturbations , in which the growth rate saturates more quickly than the other cases .",

    "the decrease in the perturbation amplitude ( and in most cases a second phase inversion ) observed at higher azimuthal modes at the latest stages of the collapse does not occur at low azimuthal mode numbers ; ( ii ) at higher azimuthal modes ( @xmath139 ) the maximum amplitude attained by spikes is significantly higher than that of bubbles ; ( iii ) the initial evolution of spikes agrees well with mikaelian s theoretical model  @xcite for perturbations with large @xmath32 .",
    "the predictions of the theoretical model are less favorable for bubble evolution ; ( iv ) the phase inversion time roughly scales with the azimuthal mode number ; ( v ) the second phase inversion , due to formation of the narrow ( rib - like ) jets at the head of each bubble , is clearly seen in parts ( c ) and ( f ) of the figure .",
    "however , in the case of large azimuthal mode , the cavity collapses before the second phase inversion is completed , as can be seen from the @xmath140 curves .",

    "one can see that at later stages of the collapse , both ratios , @xmath125 and @xmath142 attain significant values for all perturbations being considered .",

    "we reiterate that these initial growth rates are calculated before any of the azimuthal modes have completed phase inversion .",
    "therefore , the ` spikes ' and ` bubbles ' referred to in the legend of fig .  [ linveldatacomp ] are outward and inward bulges , respectively .",
    "the data is fitted to two linear models .",
    "the first is that of richtmyer  @xcite for planar geometry , @xmath144 where as usual , @xmath2 denotes the initial perturbation amplitude , @xmath4 is an atwood number , @xmath145 is the wave number , @xmath32 is the azimuthal mode , and @xmath73 is the initial velocity of the undisturbed interface ( see eq .",

    "the growth rates presented in fig .  [ linveldatacomp ] show encouraging agreement with linear models for the range of perturbations being considered .",
    "it can be also seen that there is a change in the growth rates pattern for the higher azimuthal modes ( @xmath148 based of the our data set ) .",
    "this is probably because of more pronounced nonlinear effects at those modes : in all our simulations the parameter @xmath149 has been kept constant and therefore , the parameter @xmath150 increases with the increase in the azimuthal mode number of the perturbation .",
    "one can also see some mismatch in the initial growth rates of spikes and bubbles at lower azimuthal modes .",
    "this disparity becomes less pronounced as azimuthal mode of the perturbation increases ( up to @xmath151 ) .",
    "in this work , the behaviour of the richtmyer - meshkov instability was studied for the case of a cylindrical gas ( air ) bubble compressed by an imploding molten lead shell .",
    "the main contribution of this work is to explore the rm instability in the extreme regime of atwood number @xmath0 with a liquid ( molten lead ) as one of a working fluids .",
    "our motivation is to estimate the minimum smoothness required to achieve efficient compression of the gas cavity .",
    "simulations have been performed using openfoam software for a set of parameters relevant to the prototype compression system under development at general fusion inc . as a driver for magnetized target fusion .",
    "the main results and conclusions are summarized below :    * in the regime of atwood number @xmath0 , there is a disparity between the growth rates of spikes and bubbles ; spikes undergo acceleration while bubbles move at nearly constant velocity .",
    "this disparity in growth rates becomes more prominent as the amplitude of the initial perturbation is increased .",
    "* the shape of the spikes obtained for the current set of parameters is different from that usually observed in the regime of moderate atwood numbers .",
    "the spikes retain a sharp point with the kelvin - helmholtz instability producing serrated sides ; they do not develop into the typical mushroom shape .",
    "* during the latest stages of the collapse , when the non - dimensional parameters @xmath152 and @xmath125 are no longer small , the spike amplitude starts to decrease . for some range of perturbation azimuthal modes and amplitudes ,",
    "this is the onset of a second phase inversion .",
    "* the formation of narrow molten lead jets propagating inwards and originating from the top of the bubbles has been observed during the latest stages of the collapse for modes @xmath153 . to the best of our knowledge these jets have not been observed at a gas - gas interface with moderate atwood number . * to maintain sufficient compression efficiency ,",
    "low - mode interface perturbations are not likely to be detrimental .",
    "however , high - mode perturbations are problematic and must be kept to a minimum .",
    "this numerical setup seems to produce valuable results despite its lack of sophisticated modeling for all physical phenomena involved",
