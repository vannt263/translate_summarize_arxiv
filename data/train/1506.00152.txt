    "the history of random geometric graphs started with gilbert s 1961 study ( @xcite ) and , since then , it has received much attention both in theory and applications .",
    "more formally , given a finite set @xmath0 and a real number @xmath1 , the geometric graph @xmath2 is defined as an undirected graph with vertex set @xmath3 and edges @xmath4 $ ] for all pairs @xmath5 for which @xmath6 .",
    "the theory of geometric graphs has been applied mainly in large communication network analysis , in which the connectivity of network agents strongly depends on the distance between them ; see @xcite , @xcite , and chapter 3 of @xcite . on the purely theoretical side of random geometric graphs ,",
    "the monograph @xcite is probably the best known resource .",
    "it covers a wide range of topics , such as the asymptotics of the number of subgraphs with a specific shape , the vertex degree , the clique number , the formation of a giant component , etc . from among these interesting subjects ,",
    "the present study focuses on constructing the functional central limit theorem ( fclt ) for the number of subgraphs isomorphic to a predefined connected graph @xmath7 of finite vertices .",
    "a typical setup in @xcite is as follows .",
    "let @xmath8 be a set of random points on @xmath9 .",
    "typically , this will be either an @xmath10 random sample of @xmath11 points from @xmath12 , or an inhomogeneous poisson point process with intensity @xmath13 , where @xmath12 is a probability density .",
    "we assume that the threshold radius @xmath14 depends on @xmath11 and decreases to @xmath15 as @xmath16 , but we do not impose any restrictive assumptions on @xmath12 except for boundedness . then , the asymptotic behavior of the subgraph counts given by @xmath17 ( @xmath18 denotes graph isomorphism , and @xmath7 is a fixed connected graph ) splits into three different regimes .",
    "first , if @xmath19 , called the _ subcritical _ or _ sparse _ regime , the distribution of subgraphs isomorphic to @xmath7 is sparse , and these subgraphs are mostly observed as isolated components . if @xmath20 , called the _",
    "critical _ or _ thermodynamic _ regime , for which @xmath14 decreases to @xmath15 at a slower rate than the subcritical regime , many of the isolated subgraphs in @xmath21 become connected to one another . finally , if @xmath22 ( the _ supercritical _ regime ) , the subgraphs are very highly connected and create a large component .",
    "historically , the research on the limiting behavior of subgraph counts of the type dates back to the studies of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , in all of which mainly the subcritical regime was treated .",
    "furthermore , @xcite adopted an approach based on the martingale clt for @xmath23-statistics and proved a clt under various conditions on @xmath12 and @xmath14 .",
    "relying on the so - called stein - chen method , a set of extensive results for all three regimes was nicely summarized in chapter 3 of @xcite .",
    "recently , as a higher - dimensional analogue of a random geometric graph , there has been growing interest in the asymptotics of the so - called random cch complex .",
    "see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , while @xcite provides an elegant review of that direction .",
    "somewhat parallel to , but more important for the study on the geometric features of extreme sample clouds , is an alternative that we explore in this paper . to set this up ,",
    "we introduce a growing sequence @xmath24 and a threshold radius @xmath25 . the following quantity , @xmath26 counts the number of subgraphs in @xmath27 isomorphic to @xmath7 that exist outside a centered ball in @xmath9 with radius @xmath28 : @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the usual euclidean norm .    from the viewpoint of extreme value theory ( evt ) , it is important to investigate limit theorems for @xmath26 .",
    "indeed , over the last decade or so there have been numerous papers treating geometric descriptions of multivariate extremes , among them @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in particular ,",
    "poisson limits of point processes possessing a u - statistic structure were investigated by @xcite and @xcite , the latter also treating a number of examples in stochastic geometry .",
    "the main references for evt are @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of has been partially explored in @xcite , where a growing sequence @xmath28 is taken in such a way that has poisson limits as @xmath33 .",
    "the main contribution in @xcite is the discovery of a certain layered structure consisting of a collection of  rings \" around the origin with each ring containing extreme random points which exhibit different geometric and topological behavior .",
    "the object of the current study is to develop a fuller description of this ring - like structure , at least in a geometric graph model , by establishing a variety of fclts which describe geometric graph formation between the rings .    by construction",
    ", the subgraph counts can be viewed as generating a stochastic process in the parameter @xmath34 , while a process - level extension in is much less obvious .",
    "then , while captures the dynamic evolution of geometric graphs as @xmath35 varies , only describes the static geometry .",
    "thus , the limits in the fclt for are intrinsically gaussian processes , rather than one - dimensional gaussian distributions .",
    "one of the main results of this paper is that the limiting gaussian processes can be classified into three distinct categories , according to how rapidly @xmath28 grows .",
    "the most important condition for this classification is whether or not a ball centered at the origin with radius @xmath28 , denoted by @xmath36 , asymptotically covers a _",
    "weak core_. weak cores are balls , centered at the origin with growing radii as @xmath11 increases , in which the random points are densely scattered and form a highly connected geometric graph . this notion , along with the related notion of a _ core _ , play a crucial role for the classification of the limiting gaussian processes .",
    "indeed , if @xmath36 grows so that it asymptotically covers a weak core , then the geometric graph outside @xmath36 is  sparse \" with many small disconnected components . in this case , the limit is denoted as the difference between two time - changed brownian motions .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath37 is asymptotically covered by a weak core , the geometric graph in the area between the outside of @xmath37 and inside of a weak core becomes  dense \" , and , accordingly , the limit becomes a degenerate gaussian process with deterministic sample paths .",
    "finally if @xmath37 coincides with a weak core , then the limiting gaussian process possesses more complicated structure and are even non - self - similar .",
    "we want to emphasize that the nature of the fclt depends not only on the growth rate of @xmath28 but also the tail property of @xmath12 .",
    "this is in complete contrast to , because , as seen in chapter 3 of @xcite , the proper normalization , limiting gaussian distribution , etc . of the clt",
    "are all robust to whether @xmath12 has a heavy or a light tail . in this paper",
    ", we particularly deal with the distributions of regularly varying tails and ( sub)exponential tails .",
    "however , we are not basically concerned with any distribution with a superexponential tail , e.g. , a multivariate normal distribution .",
    "the details of the fclt in that case remain for a future study .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in section 2 we provide a formal definition of the subgraph counting process .",
    "section 3 gives an overview of what was shown in the previous work @xcite and what will be shown in this paper .",
    "subsequently , in section 4 we focus on the case in which the underlying density has a regularly varying tail , including power - law tails , and prove the required fclt .",
    "we also investigate the properties of the limiting gaussian processes , in particular , in terms of self - similarity and sample path continuity . in section 5",
    ", we do the same when the underlying density has an exponentially decaying tail . to distinguish densities via their tail properties , we need basic tools in evt .",
    "in essence , the properties of the limiting gaussian processes are determined by how rapidly @xmath28 grows to infinity , as well as how rapidly the tail of @xmath12 decays .",
    "finally , section 6 carefully examines both cores and weak cores for a large class of densities .    before commencing the main body of the paper",
    ", we remark that all the random points in this paper are assumed to be generated by an inhomogeneous poisson point process on @xmath9 with intensity @xmath13 . in our opinion",
    ", the fclt in the main theorem can be carried over to a usual @xmath10 random sample setup by a standard  de - poissonization \" argument ; see section 2.5 in @xcite .",
    "this is , however , a little more technical and challenging , and therefore , we decided to concentrate on the simpler setup of an inhomogeneous poisson point process .",
    "furthermore we consider only spherically symmetric distributions .",
    "although the spherical symmetry assumption is far from being crucial , we adopt it to avoid unnecessary technicalities .",
    "let @xmath38 be @xmath10 @xmath9-valued random variables with spherically symmetric probability density @xmath12 . given a poisson random variable @xmath39 with mean @xmath11 , independent of @xmath38 , denote by @xmath40 a poisson point process with @xmath41 .",
    "we choose a positive integer @xmath42 , which remains fixed hereafter .",
    "we take @xmath43 , unless otherwise stated , because many of the functions and objects to follow are degenerate in the case of @xmath44 .",
    "let @xmath7 be a fixed connected graph of @xmath42 vertices and @xmath45 represent a geometric graph ; @xmath18 denotes graph isomorphism .",
    "we define @xmath46 next , we define a collection of indicators @xmath47 by @xmath48 from which one can capture the manner in which a geometric graph dynamically evolves as the threshold radius @xmath35 varies .",
    "note , in particular , that @xmath49 .",
    "clearly @xmath50 is shift invariant : @xmath51 and , further , @xmath52 the latter condition implies that @xmath53 only when all the points @xmath54 are close enough to each other .",
    "moreover @xmath50 can be decomposed as follows .",
    "suppose that @xmath7 has @xmath42 vertices and @xmath55 edges for some @xmath56 .",
    "letting @xmath57 be a set of connected graphs of @xmath42 vertices and @xmath58 edges ( up to graph isomorphism ) , define for @xmath59 , @xmath60 note that @xmath61 if and only if a geometric graph @xmath62 either coincides with @xmath7 ( up to graph isomorphism ) or has more than @xmath55 edges , while @xmath63 only when @xmath64 has more than @xmath55 edges .",
    "it is then elementary to check that @xmath65 are both indicators , taking values @xmath15 or @xmath66 , and satisfying , for all @xmath59 and @xmath67 , @xmath68 in addition , since @xmath50 is an indicator , it is always the case that @xmath69    the objective of this study is to establish a functional central limit theorem ( fclt ) of the _ subgraph counting process _ defined by @xmath70 where @xmath50 is given in , @xmath30 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is a properly chosen normalizing sequence .",
    "note that counts the number of subgraphs in @xmath73 isomorphic to @xmath7 that lie completely outside of @xmath37 .",
    "more concrete definitions of @xmath74 are given in the subsequent sections , where the sequence is shown to be dependent on the tail decay rate of @xmath12 .",
    "the objective of this short section is to clarify what is already known and what is new in this paper . without any real loss of generality",
    ", we will do this via two simple examples , one of which treats a power - law density and the other a density with a ( sub)exponential tail . before this , however , we introduce two important notions .",
    "( @xcite ) [ def.core ] given an inhomogeneous poisson point process @xmath75 in @xmath9 with a spherically symmetric density @xmath12 , a centered ball @xmath37 , with @xmath76 , is called a _ core _ if @xmath77    in other words , a core is a centered ball in which random points are densely scattered , so that placing unit balls around them covers the ball itself .",
    "we usually wish to seek the largest possible value of @xmath28 such that occurs asymptotically with probability @xmath66 . a related notion , the _ weak core _ , plays a more decisive role in characterizing the fclt proven in this paper .",
    "it is shown later that a weak core is generally larger but close in size to a core of maximum size .",
    "[ def.weak.core ] let @xmath12 be a spherically symmetric density on @xmath9 and @xmath78 .",
    "a _ weak core _ is a centered ball @xmath79 such that @xmath80 as @xmath81 .",
    "[ ex : power.law.tail ]    consider the power - law density @xmath82 for some @xmath83 and normalizing constant @xmath84 . using this density , we see how random geometric graphs are formed in all of @xmath9 .",
    "first , according to @xcite , there exists a sequence @xmath85 , @xmath86 such that , if @xmath87 , occurs asymptotically with probability @xmath66 .",
    "in addition , as for the radius of a weak core , it suffices to take @xmath88 .",
    "although @xmath89 grows faster than @xmath90 , they are seen to be  close \" to each other in the sense that they have the same regular variation exponent , @xmath91 .    beyond a weak core",
    ", however , the formation of random geometric graphs drastically varies .",
    "in fact , the exterior of a weak core can be divided into annuli of different radii , at which many isolated subgraphs of finite vertices are asymptotically placed in a specific fashion . to be more precise ,",
    "let us fix connected graphs @xmath92 with @xmath42 vertices for @xmath93 and let @xmath94 which in turn implies that @xmath95 , and @xmath96 under this circumstance , @xcite considered the subgraph counts given by @xmath97 and showed that weakly converges to a poisson distribution for each fixed @xmath35 . to be more specific on the geometric side , let ann@xmath98 be an annulus with inner radius @xmath99 and outer radius @xmath100 .",

    ", we may naturally anticipate that a fclt governs the asymptotic behavior of .",
    "since @xmath74 satisfying shows a slower divergence rate than @xmath115 , i.e. , @xmath116 , we may expect that infinitely many subgraphs isomorphic to @xmath92 appear asymptotically outside @xmath37 .",
    "this in turn implies that , instead of a poisson limit theorem , the fclt governs the limiting behavior of the subgraph counting process .    as the analog of the setup for ,",

    "if @xmath124 ( i.e. , @xmath37 is contained in a weak core ) , the subgraphs isomorphic to @xmath92 outside @xmath37 are further increasingly connected and form a large component .",
    "in section [ s : heavy ] , we will see that the nature of the fclt , including the normalizing constants and the properties of the limiting gaussian processes , differs according to which regime one considers . combing the results on the fclt and the poissonian results in @xcite",

    "obviously , one can take @xmath136 .",
    "as in the previous example , the exterior of a weak core is characterized by the same kind of layer structure , for which the description in figure 1 applies , except for the change in the values of @xmath126 .",

    "in section [ s : light ] of this paper , taking @xmath74 such that @xmath139 , we establish a fclt for the subgraph counting process . to this end , our argument has to be split , once again , into the three different regimes : @xmath117    as in the last example , three different gaussian limits may appear depending on the regime .",
    "this completes the full description of the annuli structure formed by random variables with an exponentially decaying tail , when combined with the poisson limit theorems in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we explore the case in which the underlying density @xmath12 on @xmath9 has a heavy tail under a more general setup than that in example [ ex : power.law.tail ] .",

    "more precisely , we take @xmath151 the reason for which we need three different normalizations is deeply related to the connectivity of a random geometric graph . to explain this ,",
    "we need the notion of a _ weak core _ ; see definition [ def.weak.core ] for the formal definition .",
    "the main point is that the density of random points between the outside and inside of a weak core is completely different .",
    "in essence , random points inside a weak core are highly densely scattered , and the corresponding random geometric graph forms a single giant component . beyond a weak core , however , random points are distributed less densely , and as a result , we observe many isolated geometric graphs of smaller size .",
    "this disparity between the outside and inside of a weak core requires different normalizations in @xmath152 . in section [ s : connect.core ] , a more detailed study in this direction is presented .",
