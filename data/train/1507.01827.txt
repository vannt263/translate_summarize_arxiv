    "asteroseismology of solar - type stars has been one of the major successes of the nasa _ kepler _ mission ( gilliland et al .",
    "the nominal mission provided data of exquisite quality for unprecedented numbers of low - mass main - sequence stars and cool subgiants .",
    "asteroseismic detections were made in more than 600 field stars ( chaplin et al . 2011a ; 2014 ) , including a sample of _ kepler _ planet hosts ( huber et al .",
    "these data have enabled a range of detailed asteroseismic studies ( see chaplin & miglio 2013 and references therein ) , many of which are ongoing .    the nominal mission ended in 2013 may with the loss of a second of the spacecraft s four onboard reaction wheels .",
    "this meant the spacecraft could no longer maintain three - axis stabilized pointing .",
    "however , thanks to the ingenuity of the mission teams , _ kepler _ data collection has continued as a new ecliptic - plane mission , k2 ( howell et al .",
    "targeting stars in the ecliptic minimizes the now unconstrained roll about the spacecraft boresight , thereby helping to compensate for the loss of full three - axis stability .",
    "the degraded photometric performance presents particular challenges for the detection of oscillations in solar - type stars .",
    "the oscillations are stochastically excited and intrinsically damped by near - surface convection .",
    "while this mechanism gives rise to a rich spectrum of potentially observable overtones , having periods of the order of minutes , it also limits the modes to tiny amplitudes , typically several parts - per - million in brightness .",
    "the opportunity to continue asteroseismic studies of solar - type stars with k2 would provide fresh data on stars in the solar neighborhood for application to both stellar and galactic chemical evolution studies .",
    "the new fields have also led to the possibility of detecting oscillations of solar - type stars in open clusters and eclipsing binaries .",
    "this would provide independent data to test the accuracy of asteroseismic estimates of fundamental stellar properties .",
    "other specific targets of interest would potentially benefit from the provision of asteroseismic data , known exoplanet host stars being obvious examples .",
    "in this paper we report the detection of oscillations in several subgiants using k2 short - cadence ( sc ) data collected during campaign1 ( c1 ) .",
    "we describe the target selection and data analysis , and also discuss the implications of our results for future k2 campaigns .",
    "our selected target list started with the hipparcos catalog ( van leeuwen 2007 ) .",
    "use of these data allows us to make robust predictions for many bright , potential k2 targets in the ecliptic .",
    "effective temperatures were estimated from the @xmath2 color data in the catalog , using the calibration of casagrande et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , and luminosities , @xmath3 , were estimated from the parallaxes .",
    "these calculations used reddening estimates from drimmel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ( negligible for many of our targets ) .",
    "we adopted @xmath4 ( torres 2010 ) , and consistent bolometric corrections from the flower ( 1996 ) polynomials presented in torres ( 2010 ) , which use the estimated @xmath5 as input .",
    "we also applied a cut on parallax , selecting only those stars having fractional parallax uncertainties of 15% or better .",
    "stellar radii were then estimated from @xmath3 and @xmath5 , and approximate masses were estimated from a simple power law in @xmath3 ( which was sufficient for selecting targets ) .",
    "the estimated hipparcos - based stellar properties were used as input to well - tested procedures ( chaplin et al .",
    "2011b ) that enabled us to predict seismic parameters and relevant detectability metrics .",
    "we narrowed down the sample to 23 well - characterized bright ( @xmath6 to 9 ) solar - type stars to be proposed for k2 observations .",
    "all targets were predicted to show solar - like oscillations on timescales of the order of minutes , necessitating sc observations .",
    "we also collected ground - based spectroscopic data on our selected c1 targets to help us check the hipparcos - based predictions , and to better understand the final yield of asteroseismic detections .",
    "observations were made using the tres spectrograph ( frsz 2008 ) on the 1.5-m tillinghast telescope at the f. l. whipple observatory .",
    "atmospheric parameters were derived using the stellar parameter classification pipeline ( spc ; see buchhave et al .",
    "spc was used to match observed spectra  taken at a resolution of 44000  to sets of synthetic model spectra to derive estimates of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , metallicity , and @xmath9 . in what follows",
    "we assume that relative metal abundances [ m / h ] returned by spc are equivalent to relative iron abundances , [ fe / h ] .",
    "table  [ tab : tab1 ] contains the derived spectroscopic parameters .",
    "there are four rapidly rotating stars in the sample , and some caution is advised regarding their estimated parameters .",
    "overall , we found good agreement between the spectroscopic parameters and the hipparcos - based values .",
    "table  [ tab : tab1 ] also includes the hipparcos - based estimates of the luminosities .    to understand the limits on k2 performance in c1 , we deliberately sampled the region of the hr diagram across which detections had been made in the nominal mission , as shown in the top panel of fig .",

    "solar - like oscillators with lower frequencies of maximum variability show larger amplitude oscillations : the lower @xmath144 , the larger is the maximum amplitude ( i.e. , brightness variation , in ppm ) and hence the easier it is to make a detection for a given @xmath145 . using the results from over 600 stars from the nominal mission we can predict oscillation amplitudes as a function of @xmath139 . with the predicted amplitudes in hand",

    "it is important to stress that these stars all lie in the part of the bottom panel where we would expect to make detections , i.e. , where @xmath149 . even though there are other targets that show lower or similar background levels in their k2 spectra , they lie at higher predicted @xmath139 where the intrinsic oscillation amplitudes , and hence the chances of making a detection , are lower .",
    "the observed @xmath139 were in good agreement with the spectroscopic predictions , at the level of precision of the data .",

    "each spectrum has been smoothed with a @xmath151 boxcar filter .",
    "sets of vertical gray solid and dashed lines are separated by the estimated average @xmath138 , and mark the spacing on which we would expect to see modes .",
    "the power envelope of the oscillation spectrum of epic201820830 is somewhat flatter in frequency than the more classic gaussian - like envelopes shown by the other three stars .",
    "this is a characteristic of hot f - type stars ( e.g. , arentoft et al .",
    "the oscillations are strongly damped and this tends to wash out the visual appearance of the oscillation spectrum .",
    "the insets show the power spectrum of the power spectrum ( psps ) of each star , computed from the region around @xmath139 .",
    "the significant peak in each psps lies at @xmath152 , and is the detected signature of the near - regular spacing of oscillation peaks in the frequency spectrum .",
    "these detection signatures persisted for each star when the respective c1 lightcurves were divided into two equal halves in the time domain and analyzed separately .",
    "there are two stars in the the bottom panel of fig .",

    "these are all rapidly rotating solar - type stars with @xmath153 in the range @xmath154 to @xmath155 .",
    "they are therefore presumably young and may be very active , which is known to lead to significant suppression of the oscillation amplitudes ( e.g. , garca et al .",
    "2010 ; chaplin et al . 2011c ; campante et al .",
    "2014 ) making it much harder to detect oscillations .",
    "the detection recipe does not yet make allowance for suppression of the oscillation amplitudes by activity .    the other star that might be expected to show a detection ( epic201602813 , plotted with an open symbol ) is noteworthy because it is by far the most metal - poor star in the sample .",
    "this may lead to attenuation of the observed amplitudes , relative to the basic predictions ( e.g. , houdek et al .",
    "1999 ; samadi et al .",
    "other explanations are that the @xmath139 scaling underpredicts the @xmath139 value for this star ; or that the spectroscopic parameters are incorrect . we think that this latter explanation is unlikely . the target - selection ( hipparcos - based ) prediction for @xmath139 was in good agreement with the spectroscopic estimate .",
    "the target is also the primary component of a single - lined spectroscopic binary ( carney et al .",
    "2001 ) , which will be spatially unresolved in the k2 pixel data .",
    "however , flux contamination from the secondary ( a suspected white dwarf ) is likely to be low .",
    "it is of course also possible that residual artifacts and other problems relating to the lightcurve extraction , preparation and filtering may have prevented a good detection being made .",
    "there are clearly persistent artifact peaks in some of the frequency spectra",
    ". moreover , the high - frequency noise levels for all stars are not close to being shot - noise limited , unlike the nominal _ kepler _ data .",
    "analysis of the k2 sc spectra therefore demands some degree of careful , manual scrutiny to be sure that a claimed detection is not the result of a chance combination of noise peaks .    not including the active target epic201756263 , of the seven cases for which we would hope to detect oscillations , there are firm detections in four and marginal detections in two",
    "this is a good return given the challenges posed by the k2 photometry .",
    "we consolidated the @xmath138 and @xmath139 estimates returned by the mode detection teams to give final asteroseismic parameters ready for asteroseismic modeling .",
    "the final parameters were those returned by an updated version of the octave pipeline ( chaplin et al .",
    ", in preparation ; see also hekker et al .",
    "its estimates had the smallest average deviation from the median estimates in a global comparison made over all pipelines and all stars .",
    "uncertainties on each final parameter were given by adding ( in quadrature ) : the formal parameter uncertainty given by the chosen pipeline ; the standard deviation of the parameter estimates given by all other pipelines ; and a small contribution to account for uncertainties in the solar reference values ( which are employed in the grid - modeling ; see chaplin et al .",
    "2014 for further discussion ) .",
    "the final parameters are listed in table  [ tab : tab2 ] .    a second set of teams",
    "were then asked to independently apply grid - based modeling to estimate fundamental properties of the four stars with firm detections .",

    "results from the first two sets were consistent with the independent luminosity estimates .",
    "using the luminosities as an additional input constraint did not have a significant impact on the results .",
    "the parallax uncertainties  which range from @xmath156 to 12%are too large to add anything useful to the seismic constraints . the fact that the second set of inputs provided results that were consistent with the estimated @xmath139 lends further confidence to the claimed detections and suggests that , at least for these data , potential bias in the @xmath139 estimates arising from spurious noise peaks is not a significant cause for concern .",
