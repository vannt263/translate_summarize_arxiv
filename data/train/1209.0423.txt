    "random tessellation theory is an active field of current mathematical research . besides theoretical developments ,",
    "there are numerous applications of random tessellations for example in the study of random structures in biology , geology and other sciences ; cf .  @xcite .",
    "apart from the classical models , such as the well known poisson hyperplane or poisson - voronoi tessellations for which we refer to @xcite , the class of iteration stable ( or stit ) tessellations has attracted considerable interest in recent times ; see @xcite and the references cited therein . in particular and as discussed in @xcite , the stit tessellations may serve as a reference model for hierarchical spatial cell - splitting and crack formation processes in natural sciences and technology , for example to describe geological or material phenomena or aging processes of surfaces .    intuitively and within a compact convex polytope @xmath2 ( we assume that @xmath3 in this paper ) with positive volume , their construction can be described as follows . at first , the window @xmath4 is equipped with a random lifetime . when the lifetime of @xmath4 runs out , we choose a hyperplane @xmath5 , which divides @xmath4 into two non - empty sub - polytopes @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "now , the construction continues independently and recursively in @xmath6 and @xmath7 until some fixed time threshold @xmath8 is reached ; see figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the outcome @xmath9 of this algorithm is a random subdivision ( tessellation ) of @xmath4 into polytopes ( called cells in the sequel ) .",
    "is a square.,width=415 ]    to be more precise , we have to specify the lifetime distribution of the cells and the law of the cell - separating hyperplanes . for this purpose ,",
    "let us write @xmath10 for the space of affine hyperplanes and @xmath11 for the subspace of linear hyperplanes in @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath12 be a measure on @xmath10 , which admits the decomposition @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a non - negative measurable function on @xmath10 , @xmath15 is the lebesgue measure on @xmath16 and @xmath17 is a probability measure on @xmath11 .",
    "we require that @xmath17 is non - degenerate in the sense that @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the unit normal of @xmath5 lying ( for definiteness ) in the upper unit half - sphere . for a polytope @xmath20 write @xmath21 for the collection of hyperplanes hitting @xmath20 .",
    "now , the lifetime of a cell @xmath20 in the above construction is chosen to be exponentially distributed with mean @xmath22 ( if @xmath17 is the uniform distribution on @xmath11 , @xmath23 is just a dimension dependent multiple of the mean width of @xmath20 ) .",
    "moreover , we choose the hyperplane splitting @xmath20 according to the ( conditional ) law @xmath24 .",
    "it is exactly this choice , which makes mathematical analysis of the so - constructed tessellations possible and completes the description of the above algorithm ; see @xcite for more details .",
    "in particular , we notice that the exponential lifetimes of the cells ensure that the construction enjoys the markov property in the continuous time parameter @xmath25 .    besides looking at the local tessellation @xmath9 within @xmath4 , it is convenient to extend @xmath9 to a whole space random tessellation @xmath26 in such a way that for any @xmath4 as above , @xmath26 restricted to @xmath4 has the same distribution as the previously constructed @xmath9 ( this is possible by consistency according to the main result in @xcite ) .",
    "we call @xmath26 a * stit tessellation * of @xmath0 since @xmath26 enjoys a stochastic ability under erations as explained later ( that @xmath26 is in fact a tessellation is ensured by the non - degeneracy assumption on @xmath17 ) .",
    "it is important that the form of @xmath12 implies that the distribution of @xmath26 is invariant under spatial translations , i.e. , the shifted tessellation @xmath27 has the same distribution as @xmath26 for any @xmath28 .    with @xmath26 ,",
    "a number of geometric objects are associated . to introduce them",
    ", we write @xmath29 for the family of cell - splitting hyperplane pieces that are introduced during the recursion steps in the above algorithm until time @xmath25 ( these are the dashed segments in figure [ fig1 ] ) . more generally , for @xmath30 we denote by @xmath31 the family of @xmath32-dimensional faces of members of @xmath29 . for @xmath33",
    "we call @xmath31 the class of * @xmath32-dimensional maximal polytopes * of @xmath26 .",
    "they are the natural building blocks of @xmath26 and its lower - dimensional face - skeletons .",
    "we also consider @xmath32-dimensional weighted maximal polytopes , where the intrinsic volumes @xmath34 , @xmath35 , constitute the weights . to define them , fix @xmath36 and @xmath37 , let @xmath38 be the circumcenter of a polytope @xmath39 , write @xmath40 for the ( measurable ) space of @xmath32-polytopes with circumcenter at the origin @xmath41 and let @xmath42 be the centered ball in @xmath0 with radius @xmath43 . now",
    ", we introduce a probability measure @xmath44 on @xmath40 as follows : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a borel subset of @xmath40 ( following the proof of equations ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) in @xcite , it can be shown that the limit is well - defined ; another argument can be given by using below ) . a random polytope with distribution @xmath44",

    "for example , @xmath50 is the * typical maximal segment * , whereas @xmath51 is the * length - weighted typical maximal - segment*. however , our approach here is more general and interpolates between the typical ( @xmath48 ) and the volume - weighted typical ( @xmath49 ) maximal polytope of dimension @xmath32 .",

    "each of these polytopes has a well - defined random birth - time .",
    "we denote these random variables by @xmath54 and order them in such a way that @xmath55 holds almost surely .",

    "we turn now to an application of theorem [ thm : generalbirthtime ] , where we consider the typical and the length - weighted typical maximal segment @xmath50 and @xmath51 of @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "these segments may have internal vertices , which arise at the time of birth of the segment ( when @xmath65 ) and thereafter subject to further subdivision of adjacent cells ; see figure [ fig1 ] for an illustration in the planar case . with the help of theorem [ thm : generalbirthtime ] we can determine the probabilities @xmath66 and @xmath67 that the typical or the length - weighted typical maximal segment of @xmath26 contains exactly @xmath68 internal vertices ( we suppress the dependency on @xmath25 in the notation of these probabilities since they are independent of the time parameter @xmath25 ) .    [ thm : generalinternalvertices ]",
    "the probabilities @xmath66 and @xmath67 are given by @xmath69 and @xmath70 moreover , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are independent of @xmath25 and @xmath12 .",
    "in the mean , the typical maximal segment has @xmath71 internal vertices in dimension @xmath3 , whereas the length - weighted typical maximal segment in space dimension @xmath72 has @xmath73 ( the mean is infinite if @xmath56 ) .    in the planar case @xmath56 ,",
