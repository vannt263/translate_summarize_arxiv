    "one of the problems originally presented in _ what is mathematics ? _",
    "book by courant and robbins @xcite is stated as follows :    _ suppose a train travels from station @xmath0 to station @xmath1 along a straight section of track .",
    "the journey need not be of uniform speed or acceleration .",
    "the train may act in any manner , speeding up , slowing down , coming to a halt , or even backing up for a while , before reaching @xmath1 .",
    "but the exact motion of the train is supposed to be known in advance ; that is , the function @xmath2 is given , where @xmath3 is the distance of the train from station @xmath0 , and @xmath4 is the time , measured from the instant of departure .",
    "on the floor of one of the cars a rod is pivoted so that it may move without friction either forward or backward until it touches the floor .",
    "if it does touch the floor , we assume that it remains on the floor henceforth ; this will be the case if the rod does not bounce .",
    "is it possible to place the rod in such a position that , if it is released at the instant when the train starts and allowed to move solely under the influence of gravity and the motion of the train , it will not fall to the floor during the entire journey from @xmath0 to @xmath1 ? _    as an exercise , the authors suggest to prove a more general result where a spherical inverted pendulum is considered instead of a planar pendulum .",
    "we consider slightly different problem introducing a viscous friction force acting on the mass point of the pendulum and prove that for an arbitrarily small friction coefficient a periodic solution always exists .",
    "moreover , we show that the considered periodic solution never approaches horizontal plane .    in the first section ,",
    "we present the system of governing dynamical equations for the system and prove some properties which we are going to use in the second section where we apply some recent results by srzednicki , wjcik and zgliczynski @xcite to our system .",
    "let @xmath5 be an orthogonal moving reference frame such that @xmath6 coincide with the pivot point of the pendulum , @xmath7 and @xmath8 axis are in a horizontal plane and always remain parallel to themselves at the initial moment of time ; @xmath9 is vertical and oriented in an opposite way to the gravitational force . by @xmath10 we denote the radius vector of the mass point in @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 be its components .",
    "since the pivot point moves periodically in the horizontal plane , then for the radius vector @xmath14 of the mass point in some fixed reference frame with its axis parallel to the axis of @xmath5 , we have @xmath15 where @xmath16 ; we assume @xmath17 to be @xmath18-periodic smooth functions .",
    "obviously , we have similar relations for the velocities and accelerations @xmath19 the mass point moves under the action of the gravitational force , the viscous friction force , and the force of constraint @xmath20 here @xmath21 is the constraint force which is parallel to the radius vector @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath22    forces of constraint are the forces which allows one to consider a system with constraints as constraint - free with additional unknown _ apriori _ forces .",
    "more on constraint forces and their use in mechanics one can find in @xcite .",
    "we assume that the friction force is determined by the following model @xmath23 we can now rewrite ( [ eq1 ] ) as follows @xmath24    for the above equation ( [ eq1mod ] ) , the solution function @xmath25 is determined by the initial conditions @xmath26 and @xmath27 .    since functions @xmath28 and @xmath29",
    "are @xmath18-periodic , then the extended phase space of our system can be considered as @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath31 be a function defined by the following equation @xmath32 now consider the submanifold @xmath33 of the extended phase space and show that if @xmath34 is large , then along the solutions starting at @xmath33 the function @xmath35 is locally decreasing .",
    "more specifically ,    [ lem1 ] there exists @xmath36 such that @xmath37    from the definition of @xmath35 and ( [ eq1 ] ) we easily have @xmath38 therefore , taking into account ( [ eq2 ] ) and that @xmath39 , we obtain @xmath40 since @xmath41 is bounded , then for @xmath34 sufficiently large we have @xmath42 .",
    "now we prove that if the pendulum , as well as its velocity vector , is in the horizontal plane , then at least locally the mass point is falling down , i.e. the following lemma is true .",
    "[ lem2 ] if the solution @xmath10 of ( [ eq1 ] ) at the time @xmath4 satisfies @xmath43 and @xmath44 , then @xmath45 .    for the pendulum being in the horizontal position and moving horizontally as well",
    ", we have the following :    1 .",
    "the friction force is always parallel to the radius vector @xmath46 , therefore , at the given conditions , the friction force is directed horizontally ; 2 .",
    "the constraint force is in the horizontal plane if @xmath47 ; 3 .",
    "@xmath5 is moving along the horizontal plane , therefore , @xmath48 = 0 .",
    "taking into account the above , from ( [ eq1 ] ) we obtain @xmath49",
    "in this section we are going to apply some recent developments in fixed point theory by srzednicki , wjcik and zgliczynski @xcite to our system and prove the existence of a falling - free periodic solution .",
    "first , following @xcite , we introduce some definitions which we slightly modify for our use .",
    "* there exists a compact subset @xmath75 of @xmath58 called the essential exit set such that @xmath76 * there exists a homeomorphism @xmath77\\times w_a \\to w$ ] such that @xmath78 and @xmath79\\times w_a^{--})=w^{--}.\\ ] ]        the monodromy map @xmath81 is a homeomorphism .",
    "moreover , it can be proved that a different choice of @xmath83 satisfying [ cond-2 ] leads to the monodromy map homotopic to @xmath81 .",
    "it follows that the isomorphism in homologies @xmath84 is an invariant of @xmath65 .",
    "[ th1 ] @xcite let w be a periodic segment over @xmath74 $ ] .",
    "then the set @xmath85 \\}\\ ] ] is open in @xmath86 and the set of fixed points of the restriction @xmath87 is compact . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath65 and @xmath75 are anrs then @xmath88 where by @xmath89 and @xmath90 we denote the lefschetz number of @xmath81 and @xmath91 respectively . in particular , if @xmath92 then @xmath93 has a fixed point in @xmath86 .",
    "let @xmath99 be a manifold with a boundary defined by the inequalities @xmath100 , @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is obtained from lemma [ lem1 ] .",
    "one can easily prove that @xmath65 is diffeomorphic to @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is a 2-dimensional disk ( with boundary ) .",
    "let us now prove that @xmath65 is a periodic segment over @xmath105 $ ] for ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "indeed , from lemma [ lem1 ] we see that the essential exit set is entirely on the boundary @xmath47 .",
    "moreover , from lemma [ lem2 ] we obtain that the points which satisfies @xmath47 and @xmath106 do not belong to the essential exit set , at the same time , if for some point we have @xmath47 , @xmath107 then this point is in the essential exit set",
    ". therefore , the essential exit set is compact .",
    "homeomorphism @xmath83 in our case is an identity map , i.e. @xmath105\\times w_0 = w$ ] .",
    "finally , one can easily see that @xmath108 is homotopic to @xmath109 and @xmath110 is homotopic to @xmath111 .",
    "therefore , taking into account that @xmath112 , we get @xmath113 and theorem [ th1 ] can be applied .",
