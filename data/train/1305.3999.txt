    "these seds are then fitted with a combination of models to represent the different components contributing to the observed sed . for this purpose",
    "we have divided our sample into two groups , depending on the amount of data available to constrain the fitted components .",
    "objects detected in at least two _ herschel _ bands were subject to full sed fits ( five sources ) , except j2054@xmath250005 , for which the lack of strong photometric constraints at rest frame wavelengths @xmath3710@xmath3 m ( no _ spitzer _ observations and only wise upper limits ) prevented a full sed fit . in our fits we consider four distinct components :    1 .   a power law in the uv / optical regime which represents the emission from the accretion disk .",

    "4 .   a modified black body to account for possible fir excess emission ( over the agn heated torus ) which we here interpret as powered by star formation .",
    "for this component we fix the emissivity index @xmath39 to a value of 1.6 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* but see section [ betafit ] ) .",
    "the temperature of the modified black body and the normalization are free parameters .",
    "the torus models we consider here are available for seven different inclinations ( starting at 0  and increasing in steps of 15 ) . for each inclination , @xcite provide models of various combinations of parameters ( opening angle , radial dust distribution , etc . ) .",
    "our fitting procedure takes one of the torus models and fits a linear combination of the four components to the observed sed via chi - square minimization using mpfit @xcite in idl .",
    "we then cycle through all torus models in the library and repeat the fitting for each of them .",
    "however , for efficiency we limit the torus component to models with inclinations @xmath4045 degrees which seems reasonable given that we observe luminous and largely unreddened type-1 quasars .",
    "this leaves a total of 959 different torus models .",
    "we visually inspect the best - fitting 10% of the model combinations to confirm the fits .    with this approach we do not intend to develop a highly accurate model for the full sed emission in these objects . for the current work we aim to construct a physically motivated approximation that yields a reasonable description of the observed seds which allows us to isolate excess fir emission and to account for ( to first order ) contributions of the agn heated nuclear dust to the fir photometry .",
    "as outlined above , our fitting includes an additional , emprically motivated 1300k black body in the nir .",
    "we have also performed the fits excluding this component , only fitting a power - law , a torus model and a fir modified black body .",
    "the comparison between both cases shows that the fits including the nir black body generally represent the observed photometry better .",
    "this is particularly apparent in wavelength regions dominated by very hot dust ( @xmath1@xmath21 - 3@xmath3 m ) , in the overlap region between the torus and the fir black body ( @xmath41@xmath220 - 30@xmath3 m ) and in the fit at @xmath41@xmath42100@xmath3 m .",
    "the temperatures of the fir dust component also come out consistently lower ( by about 5 - 10k ) in fits including the additional nir black body .",
    "recall that the additional nir component contributes significantly ( or dominantly ) to the short infrared wavelengths . in cases",
    "where this component is absent , torus models with a strong emphasis on emission at @xmath43@xmath3610@xmath3 m are favored in the fits to accomodate ( in particular ) the mips photometry . by design",
    "such torus models contribute less flux at longer wavelengths ( @xmath43@xmath4220@xmath3 m ) thus requiring a hotter fir component to match the _ herschel _ photometry .",
    "this in turn negatively affects the fit in the observed sub - mm / mm regime . including the nir component , more power in the torus component can shift to slightly longer wavelengths , allowing a cooler fir component and providing a better overall fit to the data .",
    "the need to add an additional hot component to torus models when fitting type-1 agn seds has also been noted by e.g. @xcite .",
    "nir reverberation mapping observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that the size of the emitting region of this very hot dust is a factor of @xmath220 smaller than the torus as measured in the mir via interferometry ( burtscher et al .",

    "only three objects are detected and at low significance .",
    "more detailed information on the individual objects can be found in the appendix .",
    "previous studies of star formation in high - redshift ( @xmath0 ) quasars often had to rely on single band mm emission as a tracer for the starburst heated dust ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "far - infrared luminosities were determined by fitting a single modified black body to the mm photometry and integrating under this component . since no knowledge about the temperature of the dust was at hand for most cases , typical values found for fir bright quasars at lower redshift ( @xmath45@xmath2@xmath46 ) were assumed ( e.g. t = @xmath47k , @xmath48 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this approach has been tentatively supported for some high - redshift quasars by ground - based observations at 350@xmath3 m @xcite .",
    "the new multi - wavelength fir photometry now allows us to estimate the temperature of the fir emitting dust directly while simultaneously accounting for the contributions from agn heated nuclear dust to the infrared . in figure",
    "[ sed_fits_detected ] we present the seds of the five objects which are detected in at least two _ herschel _ bands and their accompanying best fits .",
    "as explained above , details of the sed of the agn heated dust torus affects the shape ( and temperature ) of the fir component .",
    "we have taken this into account when calculating the uncertainties of the dust temperature ( see section [ sec : error_estimates ] ) .",
    "the values of t@xmath4 we obtain here for these five objects are reported in table [ results ] .",
    "we clearly see a range of temperatures among these objects , spanning almost 20k .",
    "one important result from the sed fits in figure [ sed_fits_detected ] is that the flux at @xmath43@xmath49@xmath4250@xmath3 m is usually dominated by the fir excess emission with only minor contributions from the agn heated torus .",
    "this is further illustrated in fig.[flux_ratios ] where we show the fractional contribution of the hot dust plus dusty torus component ( both presumably powered by the agn ) compared with the contributions from the fir excess component , which may be powered by star formation . as indicated in this figure , the spire 350@xmath3 m band is typically dominated by emission from the fir black body for the redshifts considered here .",
    "in fact , fitting only a single modified black body ( @xmath50 ) to the photometry at @xmath43@xmath51350@xmath3 m gives very similar dust temperatures compared to the full sed fits .",
    "this result can immediately be utilized for an estimate on the dust temperature for objects which do not qualify for full sed fits ( see figure [ sed_fits_nondetected ] ) . in these cases",
    "we use the 250ghz detection as an anchor for the ( modified ) black body while the fir upper limits at @xmath43@xmath51350@xmath3 m ( mostly from spire ) allow us to constrain the maximum permitted temperature of this component . because of our findings from the full sed fits ( fig.[flux_ratios ] ) we can assume that our upper limits to the dust temperature are reasonably robust when limiting the fits to @xmath43@xmath51350@xmath3 m , even without suitable constraints on the agn dust emission in these objects .",
    "we determine dust temperatures of @xmath4057k , with j0818 + 1722 being the only exception ( t@xmath52@xmath4071k ) .",
    "however , the latter value has to be taken with caution because the 250ghz photometry of this source could be contaminated by the emission from the nearby galaxy that is detected in most infrared bands ( see notes on individual objects in the appendix and figure [ images ] ) .      in the previous fits ,",
    "the emissivity index @xmath39 was fixed to a value of 1.6 to enable the comparison with earlier literature studies .",
    "the good photometric coverage in the fir and sub - mm for some of our objects now allows us to explore in how far @xmath39 can be constrained using the quasar seds .",
    "for such a study , additional photometry at lower frequencies ( typically around 90ghz in the observed frame ) is very important as it helps to further constrain the rayleigh - jeans tail of the fitted dust component .",
    "in fact , considering only photometry at @xmath53@xmath54250ghz does not provide good constraints on @xmath39 ( or the fir dust temperature ) if both parameters are kept free during fitting .",
    "photometry at @xmath290ghz in combination with _",
    "fir detections is available for four objects in our sample .",
    "re - fitting the seds as outlined previously but now keeping @xmath39 as a free parameter , we find relatively high @xmath39 values ( @xmath55 ) combined with relatively low temperatures ( @xmath233k , but still 54k for j1148 + 5251 ) .",
    "the integrated luminosity of the fir dust when determined from these new fits remains virtually unchanged as compared to a fixed @xmath39 approach .",

    "<S> we present _ herschel _ far - infrared ( fir ) photometry of eleven quasars at redshift @xmath0 that have previously been detected at 1.2 mm . </S>",

    "<S> these fits reveal the need for an additional far - infrared ( fir ) component besides the emission from a dusty agn - powered torus . </S>",
    "<S> this additional fir component has temperatures of t@xmath4@xmath240 - 60k with luminosities of l@xmath5@xmath210@xmath6l@xmath7 ( accounting for 25 - 60% of the bolometric fir luminosity ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the fir dust emission is due to star formation it would suggest star formation rates in excess of 1000 solar masses per year . </S>",
    "<S> we show that at long wavelengths ( @xmath8 m ) the contribution of the agn - powered torus emission is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> this explains how previous fir studies of high - redshift quasars that relied on single component fits to ( ground - based ) observations at @xmath9 m reached t@xmath4 and l@xmath4 values similar to our complete sed fits . </S>",

    "<S> the average sed of sources with individual _ herschel _ detections shows a striking surplus in near- and mid - infrared emission when compared to common agn templates . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison between two average seds ( sources with and without individual _ herschel _ detections ) matched in the uv / optical indicates that for these objects the strength of the mir emission may correlate with the strength of the fir emission . </S>"
