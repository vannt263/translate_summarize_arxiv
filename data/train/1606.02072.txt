    "<S> the finite - temperature transport properties of ferh compounds are investigated by first - principles density functional theory - based calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the focus is on the behavior of the longitudinal resistivity with rising temperature , which exhibits an abrupt decrease at the metamagnetic transition point , @xmath0 between ferro- and antiferromagnetic phases . a detailed electronic structure investigation for @xmath1  k explains this feature and demonstrates the important role of ( i ) the difference of the electronic structure at the fermi level between the two magnetically ordered states and ( ii ) the different degree of thermally induced magnetic disorder in the vicinity of @xmath2 , giving different contributions to the resistivity . </S>",
    "<S> to support these conclusions , we also describe the temperature dependence of the spin - orbit induced anomalous hall resistivity and gilbert damping parameter . for the various response quantities </S>",
    "<S> considered the impact of thermal lattice vibrations and spin fluctuations on their temperature dependence is investigated in detail . comparison with corresponding experimental data finds in general a very good agreement .    for a long time </S>",
    "<S> the ordered equiatomic ferh alloy has attracted much attention owing to its intriguing temperature dependent magnetic and magnetotransport properties . </S>",
    "<S> the crux of these features of this cscl - structured material is the first order transition from an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) to ferromagnetic ( fm ) state when the temperature is increased above @xmath3  k @xcite . in this context </S>",
    "<S> the drop of the electrical resistivity that is observed across the metamagnetic transition is of central interest . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , if the afm to fm transition is induced by an applied magnetic field , a pronounced magnetoresistance ( mr ) effect is found experimentally with a measured mr ratio @xmath4 at room temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature of the metamagnetic transition as well as the mr ratio can be tuned by addition of small amounts of impurities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these properties make ferh - based materials very attractive for future applications in data storage devices . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the large mr effect in ferh , however , is still under debate . </S>",
    "<S> suzuki et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite suggest that , for deposited thin ferh films , the main mechanism stems from the spin - dependent scattering of conducting electrons on localized magnetic moments associated with partially occupied electronic @xmath5-states @xcite at grain boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> kobayashi et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have also discussed the mr effect in the bulk ordered ferh system attributing its origin to the modification of the fermi surface across the metamagnetic transition . </S>",
    "<S> so far only one theoretical investigation of the mr effect in ferh has been carried out on an ab - initio level @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the present study is based on spin - polarized , electronic structure calculations using the fully relativistic multiple scattering kkr ( korringa - kohn - rostoker ) green function method @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this approach allowed to calculate the transport properties of ferh at finite temperatures on the basis of the linear response formalism using the kubo - steda expression for the conductivity tensor @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the volume of the unit cell , @xmath8 is the number of sites , @xmath9 is the relativistic current operator and @xmath10 are the electronic retarded and advanced green functions , respectively , calculated at the fermi energy @xmath11 . in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : bru ] ) the orbital current term has been omitted as it only provides small corrections to the prevailing contribution arising from the first term in the case of a cubic metallic system  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> here we focus on the finite temperature transport properties of ferh . in order to take into account electron - phonon and electron - magnon scattering effects in the calculations , the so - called alloy analogy model @xcite is used . within this approach </S>",
    "<S> the temperature induced spin ( local moment ) and lattice excitations are treated as localized , slowly varying degrees of freedom with temperature dependent amplitudes . using the adiabatic approximation in the calculations of transport properties , and accounting for the random character of the motions , the evaluation of the thermal average over the spin and lattice excitations in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : bru ] ) is reduced to a calculation of the configurational average over the local lattice distortions and magnetic moment orientations , @xmath12 , using the recently reported approach @xcite which is based on the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) alloy theory @xcite .    to account for the effect of spin fluctuations , which we describe in a similar way </S>",
    "<S> as is done within the disordered local moment ( dlm ) theory @xcite , the angular distribution of thermal spin moment fluctuations is calculated using the results of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations . </S>",
    "<S> these are based on ab - initio exchange coupling parameters and reproduce the finite temperature magnetic properties for the afm and fm state in both the low- ( @xmath13 ) and high - temperature ( @xmath14 ) regions very well @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> note that the experimental measurements have been performed for a sample with @xmath22 intermixing between the rh and fe sublattices leading to a finite residual resistivity at @xmath23  k , and as a consequence there is a shift of the experimental @xmath19 curve with respect to the theoretical one @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we can separate out the contributions of spin fluctuations and lattice vibrations to the electrical resistivities , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> one can also see that both components , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , in the afm state have a steeper increase with temperature than those of the fm state .    </S>",
    "<S> the origin of this behavior can be clarified by referring to mott s model @xcite with its distinction between delocalized @xmath26-electrons , which primarily determine the transport properties owing to their high mobility , and the more localized @xmath5-electrons . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the conductivity should depend essentially on ( see . e.g. @xcite ) : ( i ) the carrier ( essentially @xmath26-character ) concentration @xmath27 and ( ii ) the relaxation time @xmath28^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath29 is the average scattering potential and @xmath30 the total density of states at the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> this model has been used , in particular , for qualitative discussions of the origin of the gmr effect in heterostructures consisting of magnetic layers separated by non - magnetic spacers . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the gmr effect can be attributed to the spin dependent scattering of conduction electrons which leads to a dependence of the resistivities on the relative orientation of magnetic layers , parallel or antiparallel , assuming the electronic structure of non - magnetic spacer to be unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> these arguments , however , can not be straightforwardly applied to cscl - structured ferh , even though it can be pictured as a layered system with one atom thick layers , since the electronic structure of ferh shows strong modifications across the afm - fm transition as discussed , for example , by kobayashi et al . </S>",

    "<S> for both magnetic states the decrease of the conductivity with rising temperature is caused by the increase of scattering processes and consequent decrease of the relaxation time . </S>",
    "<S> at the same time , the conductivity difference , @xmath38 , reduces with increase in temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this effect can partially be attributed to the temperature dependent changes of the electronic structure ( disorder smearing of the electronic states ) reflected by changes in the density of states at the fermi level  @xcite ( see fig . [ </S>",

    "<S> , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=29.0%](c )    one has to stress that in calculating the contribution of spin moment fluctuations to the resistivity , the different temperature dependent behavior of the magnetic order in the fm and afm states must be taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> this means , that at the critical point , @xmath0 , the smaller sublattice magnetization in the afm state describes a more pronounced magnetic disorder when compared to the fm state which leads to both a smaller relaxation time and shorter mean free path . </S>",
    "<S> the result is a higher resistivity in the afm state .    </S>",
    "<S> the different mean free path lengths in the fm and afm states at a given temperature can be analyzed using the bloch spectral function ( bsf ) , @xmath42 @xcite , calculated for @xmath43 , since the electronic states at the fermi level give the contribution to the electrical conductivity . </S>",

    "<S> , it stems dominantly from electron scattering due to thermally induced spin - fluctuations ( diamonds in the inset to fig . </S>",

    "<S> the ferh unit cell with a lattice constant @xmath58 times smaller than that of mgo , is rotated around @xmath59 axis by @xmath60 with respect to the mgo cell . </S>",
    "<S> because of this , a compressive strain in the ferh film occurs . </S>",
    "<S> as it follows from the experimental data @xcite , this implies a tetragonal distortion of the fm ferh unit cell with @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> results of corresponding calculations for @xmath46 are given in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ferh_ahe_rho](b ) by full squares , demonstrating a rather weak effect of this distortion . </S>",
    "<S> the smaller value of @xmath46 compared to experiment , has therfore to be attributed to the use of bulk geometry instead of the experimental film geometry with a corresponding impact on the damping parameter .    in summary , we have presented ab - initio calculations for the finite temperature transport properties of the ferh compound . </S>",
    "<S> a steep increase of the electric resistivity has been obtained for the afm state leading to a pronounced drop of resistivity at the afm to fm transition temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this effect can be attributed partially to the difference of the electronic structure of ferh in the fm and afm states , as well as to a faster increase of the amplitude of spin fluctuations caused by temperature in the afm state . </S>",
    "<S> further calculated temperature dependent response properties such as the ahe resistivity and the gilbert damping parameter for the fm system show also good agreement with experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> this gives additional confidence in the model used to account for thermal lattice vibrations and spin fluctuations . </S>"
