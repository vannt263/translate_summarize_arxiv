    "the spin - hall effects ( she ) are a set of phenomena in which a transverse spin current is generated in response to an applied electric field @xcite .",
    "originally predicted by dyakonov and perel @xcite more than three decades ago , and later revisited by hirsch @xcite , the she has developed into a topic of keen interest and importance in the condensed matter field of semiconductor - based spintronics , for it allows one to generate and manipulate spin currents in paramagnetic semiconductors without the application of external magnetic fields or the use of ferromagnetic components .",
    "a key ingredient in the theory of she s is the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) effect ; a phenomenon that is formally described by dirac s equation when decomposed in the non - relativistic limit , in which a static electric field @xmath1 is lorentz transformed into an effective magnetic field @xmath2 in the rest frame of moving electrons ( @xmath3 is the electron momentum ) . in refs .",
    "@xcite it is predicted that the soc of carrier momentums with the localized potential centres of impurity atoms results in spin - dependent scattering of the carriers .",
    "the essential result is that spin - up and spin - down electrons are scattered in opposite transverse directions , resulting in a so - called extrinsic ( impurity - dependent ) she @xcite .",
    "more recently there has been widespread interest in the study of intrinsic she mechanisms , seeded by two seminal papers ; ref .",
    "@xcite which describes the transverse spin transport of holes in @xmath4-type bulk semiconductors , and ref .",
    "@xcite in @xmath0-type two dimensional heterostructures with rashba soc .",
    "in contrast to the extrinsic type , the intrinsic she does not depend on the soc between carriers and impurities , but rather on the ` built - in ' soc that is present in the band structure of the system . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the strong spin - orbit interaction in the valence band of bulk semiconductors was shown to give rise to a nontrivial momentum space topology under an applied electric field , resulting in the flow of a topological spin - hall current .",
    "on the other hand , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the rashba soc produces a she that is a result of the spin precession about the internal rashba field in the presence of an electric field .",
    "we focus on the topological she of ref .",
    "the she described there is induced by the presence of a magnetic monopole field in @xmath5-space , that arises from the coupling of the orbital angular momentum @xmath6 and spin angular momentum @xmath7 of holes in the valence band under the influence of an externally applied electric field .",
    "the presence of the monopole results in non - commuting coordinates @xcite , which leads to a lorentz - type force in @xmath5-space and a separation of spins leading to the she .",
    "+ the appearance of the monopole structure is not unique to @xmath4-doped , bulk semiconductors as studied in ref .",
    ". it also appears in other condensed matter systems , such as in the anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) in ferromagnets @xcite , the ahe in frustrated ferromagnets  e.g .",
    "pyrochlore and kagom lattices  with chiral spin textures @xcite , and in the so - called topological hall effect in specially patterned magnetic nanostructures @xcite .",
    "the monopole in general appears through the nontrivial curvature of gauge fields that are associated with an adiabatically evolving quantum system @xcite .",
    "for example , assuming a slowly varying magnetic field configuration over a parameter space @xmath8 , one can impose the condition of adiabatic spin relaxation ( i.e.  that the spins remain as eigenstates of the field ) , which in accordance with ref .",
    "@xcite gives rise to a berry curvature ( the monopole ) in @xmath8-space .",
    "when dealing with the momentum space , i.e.  @xmath9 , the curvature can be regarded as an effective , momentum dependent field which can influence the motion of carriers ( analogous to an ordinary field in real space ) , leading to modified carrier dynamics",
    ". it should be noted , however , that the appearance of a monopole curvature does not automatically result in a spin - hall effect ; this depends on other details of the system .",
    "+ in this paper , we describe an intrinsic spin - hall effect of conduction electrons in @xmath0-type bulk semiconductors with @xmath10-dresselhaus soc that are confined by a waveguide to propagate primarily in a unilateral direction . by applying an external electric field along the direction of the waveguide",
    ", we show how a monopole structure appears in the momentum space and leads to a finite she .",
    "we consider the system in the weak applied field limit such that the internal dresselhaus field is smoothly varying , and the spins remain adiabatically aligned along its direction .",
    "we discuss the origin of our she in detail and finally propose experimental setups that may be used to detect the effect , as well as to distinguish the effect from other mechanisms .",
    "we consider the dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling in the conduction band of bulk zinc - blende semiconductors .",
    "the conduction electrons in this system are described by the hamiltonian @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the dresselhaus soc strength ( units evm@xmath13 ) , @xmath14 is the vector of pauli matrices , @xmath15 are the electron momenta along @xmath16 $ ] of the crystal , c.p .  denotes the cyclic permutation in @xmath17 of the spin - orbit term , and @xmath18 is a momentum - dependent internal magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the last term in , @xmath19 , is the potential energy of electrons due to external electric field @xmath20 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues of are @xmath21 where @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) is the kinetic ( potential ) energy and @xmath24 indexes the two spin - split subbands of the dresselhaus hamiltonian .",
    "+ we begin our analysis by applying a local , unitary transformation @xmath25 to the system , such that the reference spin axis points along the direction of @xmath26 . under this transformation",
    "the hamiltonian becomes diagonalized , @xmath27 , in the spinor space . in the momentum representation ,",

    ", the position operator @xmath29 transforms into covariant form : @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is a gauge field in @xmath5-space @xcite .",
    "there is a clear analogy ( and duality ) here with standard electromagnetism : in the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath32 , the momentum operator @xmath33 transforms as @xmath34 , where the last term is the magnetic vector potential ( whose curvature equals @xmath32 ) .",
    "the computation of the gauge field @xmath35 in our system was carried out firstly by assuming that the travelling wavevector , @xmath36 , ( we consider an applied electric field in the @xmath37-direction ) has magnitude greater than the transverse wavevector components , @xmath38 . in other words , we assume electron conduction primarily along the @xmath37-direction , with a minimal angular spectrum of electrons in the transverse @xmath39-plane .",
    "this can be achieved with the help of a confinement potential @xmath40 which confines electrons to a waveguide along @xmath37 ; see , for example , ref .  @xcite . under the assumption @xmath41",
    ", the effective internal field can be approximated by the simplified field @xmath42 is also the effective internal field within a tunnel barrier with @xmath43-cubic dresselhaus soc ; see , for example , ref .",
    "the condition @xmath44 is fulfilled automatically in this scheme , i.e.  when the kinetic energy of electrons lies much lower than the potential barrier height @xcite , and need not be imposed explicitly as in our case which requires the use of waveguides @xcite .",
    "numerically , we verified that the approximation is very good when the condition @xmath45 is met . ]",
    "( hereafter , for brevity , @xmath46 shall be denoted by @xmath26 ) . then , @xmath35 can be found readily using the explicit expression for the transformation , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are spherical angles satisfying @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively . unlike the case for electromagnetism",
    ", however , our computed gauge field is pure and has no associated curvature .",
    "nevertheless , upon imposing the adiabaticity condition for the spins , we can induce a finite curvature . more specifically ,",
    "we neglect subband mixing due to the electric field , i.e.  we suppose that as electrons drift through the crystal under @xmath20 , their spins remain as eigenstates of the effective @xmath5-dependent magnetic field @xmath26 , and that transitions between the two eigenstates ( up - spin and down - spin ) are negligible . generally speaking , this condition can be realized in quantum systems when the hamiltonian is varied sufficiently smoothly ( adiabtically ) over time via one of its parameters @xcite .",
    "the adiabatic condition in our system corresponds to the low applied @xmath20-field limit , such that changes in time of the electron momentum  and hence , the effective magnetic field  are sufficiently small so that adiabatic spin relaxation may be realized .",
    "we estimate the value for the required @xmath20-field in a latter part of this paper .",
    "+ assuming adiabaticity of the electron spins , we can throw away the off - diagonal ( transition ) terms of @xmath35 .",
    "the resulting spin - state resolved u(1)-gauge fields have the form @xmath52 , and have a finite curvature that is the berry curvature in momentum space , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the fully asymmetric tensor in three dimensions . as expected @xcite , the curvature in eq .",
    "exhibits singularities at points where @xmath55 , corresponding to the degeneracy points of the spin - dependent hamiltonian in eq .  .",
    "our curvature term above can also be derived in the spirit of berry s original paper @xcite , in which we first diagonalize the system hamiltonian with respect to the magnetic field space @xmath56 . in doing so",
    ", we obtain berry s curvature in @xmath56-space that is of the form of the dirac monopole , @xmath57 . the corresponding curvature in @xmath5-space",
    "can then be found using the explicit dependence of the effective field on the electron momentum @xcite .",
    "+ in fig .",
    "[ field.fig ] , we illustrate one component of the berry curvature , @xmath58 , for normalized values of momentum , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "one can see that the curvature term appears smooth at all points except at the origin @xmath61 where the limit is undefined .",
    "this feature of our curvature can be attributed directly to the existence of the singularity of @xmath62 in the effective field space , and leads to the non - trivial electron dynamics which characterizes our she .",
    "albeit in reciprocal space , eq",
    ".   represents a field that is analogous to an ordinary magnetic field in real space in non - commutative quantum mechanics since in the presence of our gauge one can show such relations as @xmath63=-i f_{ij}(\\vec{k})\\equiv - i\\omega_k ( \\vec{k})$ ] . in contrast , for a classical magnetic field @xmath32 with vector potential @xmath64 , i.e.  @xmath65 , the canonical momentums become non - commuting in a similar way , namely we have the relations @xmath66=-ie b_k(\\vec{r})$ ] from which the lorentz force follows from heisenberg s equation of motion , i.e.  @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "the apparent underlying duality allows @xmath68 to be interpreted as a magnetic field in momentum space , which gives rise to a @xmath5-space ` lorentz - type ' force . just like a classical field",
    ", @xmath68 affects the motion of iternerant electrons , which is characterized by the equations of motion derived in ref .",

    "we find that as @xmath110 is increased , which corresponds to restricting the fermi surface to smaller caps , the spin - hall conductivity decays exponentially .",
    "it should be noted that for simplicity , we ignored any quantization effect from @xmath40 in our calculations .      as alluded to previously",
    ", our effect arises in waveguides of @xmath0-doped bulk zinc - blende materials in the adiabatic limit . in this limit the spins follow the quantization axis set in the direction of the effective magnetic field , allowing one to apply the abelian approximation and to obtain a non - vanishing berry curvature .",
    "following @xcite , the adiabaticity condition is satisfied when the rate of change of the spin - quantization axis , @xmath111 , is much smaller than the larmor precession frequency .",

    "@xcite appears too large to satisfy the adiabatic condition .",

    "@xcite does not impose waveguided transport of carriers .",

    "@xcite does not warrant a direct comparison with our theoretical predictions above , we propose that for slight modifications to the experimental setup such that the adiabatic regime is achieved , a detailed analysis of the resulting she should consider possible contributions arising from our mechanism .",

    "are valid within time @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is of the order of typical scattering times governing ballistic transport . in the context of",
    "the she the discussion of impurities is important as the braking effect of scattering , which is required for the system to reach a steady state , reduces the intrinsic spin - hall conductivity and in some cases completely destroys it .",
    "for example , it is well known that the vertex correction in the rashba system @xcite exactly cancels the predicted universal spin - hall conductivity of @xmath130 @xcite .",
    "this cancellation , however , is a special case for the @xmath5-linear rashba and dresselhaus hamiltonians in 2degs and is not the case for general spin - orbit hamiltonians , e.g.  in @xmath131-coupling in two dimensional hole gases @xcite , @xmath4-type bulk semiconductors @xcite and @xmath0-type bulk semiconductors with @xmath10-dresselhaus soc @xcite ( the present system ) .",
    "our intrinsic spin - hall conductivity is therefore expected to survive even in the presence of impurities .",
    "+ we compute the predicted value for the spin - hall conductivity @xmath94 in gaas to be @xmath132 ( assuming @xmath108 and normalized to have units of charge conductivity ) for a ballistic sample . from ref .",
    "@xcite , and taking into consideration the constrained fermi sphere due to the waveguide , the longitudinal charge conductivity is estimated to be @xmath133 , so our spin - hall effect can be fairly prominent in the background of the charge conduction . as shown in fig .",
    "[ spin_cond.fig ] , even though @xmath94 drops off rapidly with increasing @xmath110 , the rate of decrease of the ratio @xmath134 is weaker , so this remains true for larger @xmath110 .",
    "one should note however that because of the definition of spin current used , our value for @xmath94 can not be directly related to the observed spin accumulation in actual samples , in which the spin is not a good quantum number because of soc . to do so",
    ", one should use the alternative , conserved spin current definition @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the simpler conventional definition provides a useful insight and working order of magnitude for @xmath94 .",
    "+ the mechanism for the she described in this article should be contrasted from the intrinsic mechanisms described in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath0-type bulk semiconductors , and in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath0-doped 2 dimensional electron systems with rashba soc , as we explain below .",
    "the latter mechanisms for she can be viewed as a spin precessional ( `` torque - based '' ) effect about the spin - orbit field in the presence of an applied @xmath20 field . as we have seen , the drift action of @xmath20 affects the spin - orbit field @xmath135 .",
    "as explained in our paper , for small electric fields the spins adiabatically follow the direction of @xmath135 , but there is also an accompanying non - adiabatic correction to the effective field experienced by electrons @xcite .",
    "this component has the form @xmath136 and arises from the time - dependence of @xmath135 .",
    "the she s of refs .",
    "@xcite occur as a result of the spin - precession about this field .",
    "because of soc , the precession behavior ( rotation ) is governed by the electron momentum i.e.  the spins of electrons traveling in opposite transverse directions tilt in an antiparallel manner , resulting in a finite spin - hall conductivity . on the other hand ,",
    "in the topological effect induced by the adiabatic relaxation of spins to @xmath135 described presently , electrons in antiparallel spin states experience opposite anomalous transverse velocities , also giving rise to non - zero @xmath94 ( the effect is `` force - based '' ) .",
    "the physical origin of the lorentz - type force which gives rise to the anomalous velocities is , however , related to the non - adiabatic correction of the spin - orbit field @xcite .",
    "+ we briefly discuss a possible experimental setup for the detection of our effect , that is similar to that used in ref .",
    "@xcite , but ( i ) with an applied electric field which guarantees adiabaticity as in eq .  , and ( ii ) an implementation of a waveguide structure for the carrier transport e.g.  through the use of electrostatic gates .",
    "furthermore , the hall bar should ideally have longitudinal dimension that is of the order of the mean free path ( @xmath137 ) , to impose ballistic transport of the carriers ; for larger samples the effect of impurities will reduce the spin - hall conductivity . at low temperature",
    ", @xmath0-type bulk gaas has @xmath138 m depending on the quality of the sample and the doping concentration , ( the longitudinal length of the hall bar in ref .",
    "@xcite was @xmath139 m ) . without any hall contacts attached to the sample ,",
    "the constant spin supply from our effect should be manifested as spin accumulation at the sample edges . since the spin relaxation time of conduction electrons in semiconductor systems is quite long ( @xmath140 ps )",
    ", the spatial distribution of the resulting spin accumulation should be detectable by kerr rotation microscopy techniques .",
    "identification of our effect from other mechanisms including the extrinsic and precessional - intrinsic effects could be made readily based on the knowledge that the contribution to the total spin - hall conductivity from our effect is sensitive to the applied electric field , the cut - off being at the adiabatic field limit of @xmath141 .",
    "+ in summary we described an intrinsic , topological spin - hall effect in waveguided , @xmath0-type bulk zinc - blende semiconductors in the adiabatic applied field limit .",
