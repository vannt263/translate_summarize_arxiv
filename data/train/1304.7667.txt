    "given their exotic properties and intriguing promise for topological quantum information processing,@xcite majorana fermions have recently received much attention in the condensed - matter context.@xcite promising habitats of majorana fermions include the @xmath2 fractional quantum hall state @xcite as well as topological insulator edges @xcite or semiconductor quantum wires@xcite proximity coupled to @xmath3-wave superconductors .",
    "several experiments may have already provided evidence for majorana bound states in semiconductor quantum wires.@xcite one of the most direct but also challenging experimental confirmations of the existence of majorana bound states would be based on the periodicity of the josephson effect . for junctions of topological superconductors , the josephson effect is predicted to be @xmath0 periodic in the phase difference of the order parameter , in sharp contrast to the conventional @xmath1 periodicity@xcite ( see also refs .   for more recent works ) .",
    "recently , it was noticed that a topological - insulator edge , proximity coupled to an @xmath3-wave superconductor exhibits an exact superconductivity - magnetism duality.@xcite the duality transformation maps the phase of the superconducting order parameter to the direction of the applied magnetic field in the plane perpendicular to the spin  orbit field . as a consequence ,",
    "the duality predicts a magneto - josephson effect by which a rotation of the magnetic field across a junction induces a josephson current even in the absence of a phase gradient.@xcite    explicitly , proximity - coupled topological - insulator edges are described by the bogoliubov - de gennes hamiltonian@xcite @xmath4 here we have employed the nambu spinor basis @xmath5 and introduced pauli matrices @xmath6 and @xmath7 that act in the spin and particle - hole sectors , respectively .",

    "this hamiltonian takes the same form upon interchanging the magnetic terms @xmath16 with the superconducting terms @xmath17 .",
    "an important aspect of this duality is that it maps the two topologically distinct phases of the model into each other , mapping the ` @xmath18-phase ' ( occurring for @xmath19 ) into the ` @xmath14-phase ' ( occurring for @xmath20 ) and vice versa .    for topological - insulator edges",
    ", the duality immediately allows one to derive the periodicity of the magneto - josephson effect from the known periodicities of the majorana josephson effect.@xcite to this end , we consider three - leg junctions @xcite with the phase arrangements @xmath21 ( with a @xmath1-periodic majorana josephson effect ) and @xmath22 ( with a @xmath0-periodic majorana josephson effect ) .",
    "the duality implies that the periodicities are reversed for the magneto - josephson effect , which is @xmath0 periodic in the magnetic - field orientation for @xmath21 junctions but @xmath1 periodic for a @xmath22 setup .",
    "strictly speaking , the duality also maps charge josephson currents into spin josephson currents . at first sight",
    ", this may suggest that a change in direction of the magnetic field across a junction only drives a spin josephson current .",
    "however , it was shown in ref .   that as a result of the spin - momentum locking , there is also a conventional ( and experimentally more accessible ) charge current across the junction in addition to the spin current .    while the magneto - josephson effect has been studied in some detail for topological insulator edges,@xcite much less",

    "we derive the periodicities in both @xmath31 and @xmath15 for the quantum - wire case by analytical arguments .",
    "our arguments assume the well - established fractional josephson effect ( i.e.  a @xmath0-periodic @xmath31 dependence ) for a @xmath24 junction and reproduce the numerically obtained periodicities summarized in table [ tab : periodic_table ] . to this end",
    ", it suffices to derive the number of protected zero - energy crossings considering particular limiting cases of the two types of junctions . by adiabatic continuity , these periodicties",
    "must then hold for junctions of the same kind with arbitrary parameters .",
    "consider first a quantum - wire junction in the @xmath22 configuration .",
    "the @xmath18 phase of the quantum wire is adiabatically connected to the vacuum by making the chemical potential large and negative . at the same time , the @xmath14 phase is adiabatically connected to a spinless @xmath61-wave superconductor by taking the limit of large zeeman field @xmath14.@xcite consequently , a @xmath22 junction can be adiabatically deformed into an essentially finite segment of a @xmath61-wave superconducting wire with hard - wall boundary conditions . in this limit ,",
    "the two majorana bound states localized at the domain walls hybridize and split by some finite energy .",
    "clearly , the two majorana bound states will penetrate only very little into the @xmath18 sections of the junctions , and consequently , they will be only weakly dependent on @xmath31 and @xmath15 as long as @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the chemical potential in the outer @xmath18 segments of the wire .",
    "thus , while there will be a variation of the energy splitting with @xmath31 and @xmath15 , it will be small compared to the magnitude of the splitting itself . thus , there are no zero - energy crossings in this case and the josephson current is @xmath1 periodic both in @xmath15 and @xmath31 .",
    "these considerations are only valid for the quantum wire because the decay length of the majorana states into the insulating segments on the outside is controlled by @xmath64 . in a ti - edge junction",
    "the gap in the @xmath18 segments is controlled by the pairing strength @xmath18 and not by @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , the effect of @xmath18 in ti edges is never perturbative and the above argument does not hold for @xmath31 .",
    "we now turn to the @xmath21 junction for which the majorana energy is @xmath0 periodic both in @xmath31 and @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath0 periodicity as a function of @xmath31 represents the well - known fractional josephson effect.@xcite in the remainder of this section , we demonstrate that the parities of the number of protected zero - energy crossings of the majorana energy dispersion as a function of @xmath31 and @xmath15 are equal for a @xmath21 quantum wire junction .",
    "the basic observation is that we can again consider the limit in which the middle @xmath18 section has a large and negative @xmath11 . in this insulating limit ,",
    "the gap does not close when we take @xmath14 and @xmath18 equal to zero . in effect",
    ", we can thus replace the @xmath65 junction by a @xmath66 junction , where the middle section is a conventional insulator ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "we start by considering a @xmath68 interface between a @xmath14 dominated phase with @xmath69 and a normal insulator with @xmath70 and @xmath63 . this interface harbors one zero - energy majorana bound state with wavefunction @xmath71 .",
    "we can tune the left region to the phase @xmath31 and the angle @xmath15 by performing the unitary transformation @xmath72 on the majorana wavefunction , i.e. , @xmath73 .",
    "it is crucial for our argument that we can effect the variation of @xmath31 and @xmath15 in the left region by a _ global _",
    "transformation @xmath74 , which is possible because the rotation of @xmath14 and @xmath18 does not affect the normal insulator on the right .",
    "we note that @xmath75 , which guarantees that the majorana wavefunction evolves to the same final state , when either @xmath31 or @xmath15 advance by @xmath1 .",
    "we now consider weak coupling of two such interfaces in a @xmath66 junction .",
    "this coupling leads to a symmetric splitting of the two majorana states about zero energy .",
    "when the coupling across the junction is sufficiently weak , we can obtain this subgap spectrum emerging from the majorana modes localized at the junction accurately from first - order perturbation theory .",
    "starting at @xmath76 and tuning either @xmath31 or @xmath15 to @xmath1 the initial wavefunction evolves to the same final state .",
    "consequently , the initial and final subgap - energy spectra emerging from the hybridized majorana modes will be identical for both processes .",
    "we know from the fractional josephson effect that the positive - energy excitation at @xmath77 becomes negative ( and vice versa ) when @xmath31 advances by @xmath1 , and hence the associated bogoliubov - de gennes eigenenergy must cross zero energy an odd number of times in the process .",
    "given that @xmath75 , this immediately implies that the positive- and negative - energy excitations also exhibit an odd number of zero - energy crossings when tuning @xmath15 from 0 to @xmath1 instead , which proves the @xmath0 periodicity as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "it is worth noting that this argument fails for the ti edge model ( [ eq : defh ] ) , as it should according to table [ tab : periodic_table ] .",
