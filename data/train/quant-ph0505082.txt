    "about two decades of research in quantum information have led to the picture of quantum entanglement as a precious resource that plays a key role in processing information more securely and more efficiently than classically possible @xcite .",
    "entanglement is necessary for quantum teleportation @xcite and the exponential acceleration of quantum algorithms @xcite , and it allows for secure quantum key distribution @xcite .",
    "recent experimental demonstrations of quantum teleportation @xcite and small scale quantum computation @xcite confirm this picture .",
    "creating and manipulating entanglement in a controlled way remains a challenge , as environmentally induced decoherence tends to rapidly destroy entanglement . on the other hand",
    ", it has been shown that the coupling of two quantum systems to a common heat bath can also _ create _ substantial ( mixed state ) entanglement .",
    "this effect was originally demonstrated in the framework of an exactly solvable model @xcite , and has been confirmed by perturbative calculations in the markovian regime @xcite .",
    "cirone et al .",
    "have unveiled a connection to the casimir - polder interaction @xcite , and oh and kim have shown by a renormalization group analysis how the effect can be understood through an effective induced interaction between the quantum systems _ via _ the common heat bath @xcite .",
    "heat baths are ubiquitous , and one might therefore wonder , if `` reservoir induced entanglement '' ( rie ) @xcite , i.e.  creation of entanglement through coupling to a common heatbath is common place and over what distances and with what time dependence it might arise .",
    "for example , all quantum systems containing charged particles couple to the ambient thermal electro  magnetic radiation ,",
    "i.e.  the black body radiation ( bbr ) in a laboratory or cryostat at the corresponding temperatures , and even in free space there is still the cosmic micro  wave background ( cmb ) , a basically perfect black body radiation at an absolute temperature @xmath0 k that fills the entire known universe @xcite .",
    "do these heat baths induce entanglement between remote quantum systems ?    in this paper i show that bbr effectively constitutes two different heat baths which couple differently to the couple alice  bob , and whose effects largely cancel when it comes to entanglement creation .",
    "entanglement is therefore created only very slowly , far behind the light ",
    "cone , and the entanglement created oscillates as a function of time . the entanglement can be close to perfect , but the first maximum entanglement arrives only after a time @xmath1 which scales like the 3rd power of the distance @xmath2 between the two quantum systems , @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the fine structure constant and the speed of light in vacuum , respectively , and @xmath6 denotes the dipole moment of the quantum system divided by the electron charge .",
    "the slow creation of entanglement limits the distance over which it can be created before competing decoherence processes set in .",
    "i will elucidate the role of the high - frequency , far off - resonant modes of the heat bath , and discuss the temperature dependence of the phenomena .",
    "let us consider two identical quantum systems a and b which couple to the thermal electromagnetic radiation field in open space , as exemplified by the cmb , but which do not interact directly .",
    "we assume that a and b can be approximated as two state systems with states @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "it turns out that the standard quantum optics approach of rotating wave approximation and markovian master equations based on fermi golden rule rates ( i.e. second order perturbation theory in the atom  field coupling constants ) is not fully adequate for describing rie .",
    "firstly , the explicit dependence of the time scale on which rie is produced on the cut  off frequency of the heat bath found in @xcite hints to the importance of non  resonant modes , which invalidates the rotating wave approximation .",
    "one might argue that in @xcite non  resonant modes came into play because degenerate energy levels were considered , but even for finite level spacing @xmath9 the high  frequency modes should be relevant for times @xmath10 .",
    "note that the rotating wave approximation was also avoided in @xcite .",
    "secondly , there is evidence that for the specific heat bath and quantum systems to be discussed here rie is an effect that arises only at fourth order in the coupling constants @xcite .",
    "both issues combined call for a fourth order calculation without rotating wave approximation , which makes the theory very heavy . on the other hand , the problem can be solved exactly and with less effort in the case of degenerate energy levels @xcite .",
    "this approach will be followed here .    from an experimental point of view , two  state systems with exactly degenerate energy levels are hard to find .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that a finite level spacing just introduces an upper limit to the time for which the present theoretical analysis is applicable : for any experiment terminated within a time @xmath11 the system hamiltonian of the two  state systems a and b can be neglected @xcite . whether or not entanglement can still be produced beyond this time is an interesting experimental question .",
    "double quantum dots ( dqds ) seem to be a promising candidate , and the following analysis will be geared specifically towards these systems .",
    "recently , the coherent manipulation of two states @xmath7 and @xmath8 located in the two wells of a single such device , as well as state preparation and state measurement were demonstrated ; coherence times of the order 1 - 10ns were achieved @xcite .",
    "the energy barrier between the two wells as well as the energies of @xmath7 and @xmath8 in a dqd can be tuned with the help of gate voltages and the barrier can be made very high after the preparation of a superposition , such that @xmath7 and @xmath8 become to good approximation degenerate eigenstates of the dqd hamiltonians . the question of whether or not the two state approximation still holds when we have to consider high  frequency modes might be addressed eventually experimentally by trying to shield each dqd with its own superconducting cavity .",
    "modes with frequency higher than the superconducting gap will be absorbed and one might thus envisage to control the cut  off frequency of the heat bath .",
    "otherwise a cut  off of the order @xmath12 arises naturally due to the band  gap of the semi  conductor material in which the dqds are embedded ; e.m .  waves with higher frequencies get absorbed in the semi ",
    ". a disadvantage of the dqds are the competing intrinsic decoherence mechanisms such as phonon scattering @xcite and fluctuating electric fields @xcite other than those from the bbr , which will be neglected in the following analysis .    as for the heat bath , i will consider specifically bbr with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "one might wonder if the mode structure ( and thus the boundary conditions ) make a difference , as each mode couples to two spatially separated quantum systems . for the geometrical situation considered below , and within dipole approximation of the coupling , it turns out that a box  shaped cavity with perfectly conducting walls leads , in the limit of infinite volume and fixed distance @xmath2 , to the same interaction hamiltonian , and one can thus read in the following cmb with periodic boundary conditions or bbr in a box  shaped cavity interchangeably .",
    "let us arrange the two dqds such that the axes of the dots are aligned with the vector joining them , designated as @xmath13 axis in the following .",
    "the position operators of an electron in dot 1 and 2 have the matrix elements @xmath14 .",
    "all other matrix elements of @xmath15 vanish to very good approximation due to the exponentially small overlap of the states @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and so do the matrix elements of the other electron coordinates @xmath16 and @xmath17 for an assumed even parity of the ground state wave functions .",
    "for describing the bbr i use a slightly unconventional representation of the electro  magnetic field , which is very useful for the exact treatment for vanishing level spacing ( or in general , if one does not use the rotating wave approximation ) . in fact , the bbr can be considered as two independent heat baths ( see appendix [ appi ] ) , one containing cos  waves , the other sin  waves , with an electric field operator @xmath18 and canonical coordinate operators @xmath19 of the harmonic oscillators corresponding to the different electro  magnetic field modes .",
    "the @xmath20 are quantized wave vectors ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 for @xmath23 , for quantization in a volume @xmath24 with periodic boundary conditions ) , @xmath25 counts polarizations , @xmath26 distinguishes the cos  waves ( @xmath27 ) from the sin  waves ( @xmath28 ) , and the @xmath29 on the sum means summation restricted to @xmath30 . the free field hamiltonian reads @xmath31 with @xmath32 .    placing the two dqds at positions @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) we obtain in dipole approximation the coupling hamiltonian @xmath36 written in terms of pauli matrices @xmath37",
    ", @xmath38 in the basis @xmath39 of dots 1 and 2 .",
    "the coupling coefficients @xmath40 are given by @xmath41 and the same equation holds for @xmath42 up to the change @xmath43 .    in the regime of energy degenerate states",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 discussed above , the time evolution of each dot due to its own system hamiltonian can be neglected , and the total hamiltonian is thus simply @xmath44@xcite .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian represents a generalization of the situation considered in @xcite , in the sense that each mode of the bbr couples through a different `` system coupling agent '' @xmath45 .",
    "note , however , that all coupling agents commute with each other .",
    "this allows to generalize the time evolution derived in @xcite of the reduced density matrix describing the two dqds alone to @xmath46 \\big\\}\\langle s|\\rho(0,t_0)|s'\\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is one of the four states @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , or @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are the corresponding eigenvalues of @xmath53 .",
    "it was assumed that the bath is initially in thermal equilibrium , and that the total initial density matrix factorizes into a system part and a bath part .",
    "the dependence on the time of travel of a light signal between the two dqds , @xmath54 with @xmath55 , will appear below .    for the arrangement of the dqds described above , only one polarization direction ( @xmath56 ) contributes , with @xmath57 in polar coordinates for @xmath20 . with the abbreviation",
    "@xmath58 the relevant eigenvalues are @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "all other eigenvalues vanish . the functions @xmath61 and @xmath62 depend on @xmath63 as ( @xmath64 ) @xmath65 transforming the sums over modes @xmath66 into integrals for the limit of large @xmath67",
    ", we find @xmath68 with @xmath69 in the basis @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the fine  structure constant . in the following",
    ", both @xmath72 and @xmath73 will be expressed in units of the thermal time @xmath74 for all finite temperatures . the functions @xmath75 and @xmath76 are then given by @xmath77 the integrals extend in principle from zero to infinity , but a uv cut  off @xmath78 is needed to regularize them .",
    "due to @xmath79 , the final density matrix depends only on the phase difference @xmath80 , which can be written in closed form as @xmath81 note that @xmath82 remains finite for @xmath83 . for large @xmath72 and @xmath73 , @xmath82 increases proportional to @xmath72 and",
    "decays as @xmath84 .",
    "the functions @xmath85 on the other hand scale like @xmath86 with the cut  off , which gives a physical significance to the high  frequency modes .",
    "the influence of the form of the cut ",
    "off function will be examined below . for the moment",
    "we assume the simplest form , a sharp cut  off at @xmath87 .",
    "i have evaluated the entanglement of formation @xmath88 for an initial state in the form of a pure product state , @xmath89 , i.e.  @xmath90 using wootter s formula @xcite and by numerically integrating the remaining expressions for @xmath75 .",
    "alternatively , one may approximate @xmath91 for @xmath92 , which allows for an analytical solution also for @xmath93 .",
    "the result for @xmath94k and @xmath95 nm is shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "clearly , there is no entanglement for space  like separated points , @xmath96 .",
    "however , almost perfect mixed state entanglement arises for @xmath97 , starting at around @xmath98 .",
    "the entanglement oscillates rapidly as function of @xmath72 , and vanishes for @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is a constant of order @xmath101 in agreement with eq.([tmax ] ) .",
    "this behavior can be understood by considering the long time limit @xmath102 , which leads to @xmath103 for @xmath92 . in this case",
    "the final density matrix depends only on two variables , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , with @xmath106 fig.[fig2 ] shows the corresponding entanglement .",
    "the function is @xmath107periodic in @xmath108 with a first maximum at @xmath109 , which leads to eq.([tmax ] ) for the first maximum entanglement .",
    "the scaling of @xmath110 with @xmath111 makes the entanglement production extremely slow : during the lifetime of the universe , it would have reached a distance of only about 8.4 km for @xmath112 m . for the same dipole moment , a distance of about 52@xmath113 m should be reached during a coherence time of the order of 100ns .",
    "the maximum amount of entanglement as well as the time to first finite entanglement creation is controlled by @xmath114 , which has to be smaller than about 50 .",
    "one should therefore try to have a large @xmath6 for a large maximum distance and a small @xmath115 to get large maximum entanglement , whereas the temperature becomes irrelevant in this regime ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "note that @xmath117 cancels in the expression for @xmath108 for large @xmath118 , such that also @xmath1 becomes independent of temperature .     for two",
    "initially not entangled dqds with @xmath95 nm coupled to the cmb at @xmath94k as a function of @xmath119 and @xmath120 , @xmath74 .",
    "black means perfect entanglement , @xmath121 , white no entanglement @xmath122 .",
    "entanglement is created only for @xmath123 . ]     as function of @xmath124 and the phase @xmath125 .",
    "the latter increases linearly with time @xmath72 leading to entanglement oscillations , and decays as @xmath126 , which makes the entanglement creation very slow for large distances @xmath2 . ]",
    "the physical origin of the entanglement generation can be understood as arising from an effective interaction @xmath127 mediated through the coupling to the common bath @xcite .",
    "this idea can be made quantitative by observing that a hamiltonian of the type @xmath128 where @xmath129 is an arbitrary operator acting on the hilbert space of the system ( i.e. here the qubits of alice and bob ) leads to the time evolution operator @xcite @xmath130 with the shift operator @xmath131 , bath hamiltonian @xmath132 , and the effective interaction @xmath133 it is very instructive to calculate this interaction explicitly for the example at hand . to that end",
    "we revert momentarily to the standard expression of the electric field , eq.([e ] ) , and allow for arbitrary orientation of the dqds .",
    "if we denote the orientations by unit vectors @xmath134 and observe that the index @xmath135 in eq.([hk ] ) stands for wave vector and polarization @xmath136 , we have @xmath137 with coupling constants @xmath138 with @xmath139 . the evaluation of the sum over all modes in eq.([heff ] ) leads , in the limit of continuous @xmath20 and infinite cut  off frequency , to @xmath140 i.e. a dipole ",
    "dipole interaction .",
    "this explains the @xmath141 dependence of the phase @xmath82 and its proportionality to @xmath72 for large times .",
    "of course , the electric field can not mediate an instantaneous interaction , as eq.([heff1 ] ) might suggest .",
    "the full time dependence must take into account also the free bath hamiltonian , and @xmath142 together lead indeed to the correct retardation behavior .",
    "this is seen from eq.([phim ] ) when we take the limit @xmath143 .",
    "the first oscillating term @xmath144 arises from the sharp cut - off and will average to zero for a smoother cut - off .",
    "the last term vanishes for @xmath83 , and the remaining sin - integral functions conspire to a heaviside theta",
    " function on the light ",
    "cone , @xmath145 , with the consequence that no entanglement can be created faster than the speed of light with this effect .",
    "the matrix @xmath146 in eq.([rhofinal ] ) is seen to arise from the difference of eigenvalues of @xmath147 defined by the indices of the density matrix .",
    "one might be tempted to think at this point that the entanglement generation is trivial in the sense that the hamiltonian for the two dqds and the heat bath just amounts to a fancy reformulation of the dipole ",
    "dipole interaction between the dqds initially assumed non  interacting .",
    "this is , however , not the case : first of all , as can be seen from eq.([uma ] ) the effective interaction is not the only term that determines the dynamics of the entanglement generation .",
    "rather it is supplemented by two shifts in the harmonic oscillators , which depend on the state of the two dqds .",
    "the reduced overlaps of the harmonic oscillators are responsible for the decoherence quantified by the functions @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "thus , there needs to be a balance between the effective interaction induced and the decoherence due to state dependent coupling to the heat bath , and this balance is made quantitative by the functions @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath82 .",
    "the effect of decoherence ( and possibly the retardation ) would be overlooked , if one started directly with a hamiltonian containing the dipole ",
    "dipole interaction .",
    "secondly , the heat bath is initially in thermal equilibrium , and the thermal noise reduces the amount of entanglement additionally compared to the @xmath150 case .",
    "so the nature of the environment as a heat bath is important , and not just the fact that it induces a well  known interaction",
    ".    one might wonder whether one can speed up the entanglement generation by reservoir engineering .",
    "one obvious attempt would be to selectively supress the coupling to one of the two heat baths , say the sin  waves .",
    "in fact , the calculation shows that for a complete supression of the coupling to the sin  waves the entanglement becomes basically independent of @xmath2 and entanglement would be created quasi  instantaneously , fig.[figsym ] .",
    "the difference arises from the fact that @xmath151 , a phase difference accumulated from the couplings to the @xmath152 and @xmath153 waves , is replaced by a single phase from the @xmath152waves alone .",
    "the latter contains a large distance independent term which normally cancels a corresponding term from the @xmath153waves . without the @xmath153waves ( @xmath154 )",
    "this term leads to a very rapid , distance independent growth of @xmath125 and therefore to the quasi instantaneous entanglement creation .",
    "we conclude that the two independent heat baths counteract each other when it comes to entanglement creation , and this leads to much slower entanglement creation based on the small remaining , distance dependent phase accumulation .     for a hypothetical coupling to the cos ",
    "waves only .",
    "entanglement production is basically independent of @xmath2 in the interval shown , and thus possible quasi - instantaneously ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "same parameters and grey  scale code as in fig.[fig1 ] ]    while a comlete suppression of the sin  waves ( or the coupling to them ) might be illusive , even a very small suppression ( as one might imagine in a cavity by using a thin , uncharged wire ) would lead quickly to entanglement creation faster than the speed of light .",
    "fig.[fig3 ] shows the entanglement for @xmath155 as function of @xmath156 and @xmath120 , where @xmath157 measures the relative coupling strength to the sin  waves ( @xmath158 and @xmath159 ) .",
    "the smaller @xmath156 , the faster the entanglement arises , but up to @xmath156 very close to unity , almost perfect entanglement is created for @xmath96 .     as function of @xmath156 and @xmath120 .",
    "the parameter @xmath156 measures the coupling strength to the sin  waves ( 0 no coupling , 1 full coupling ) .",
    "already values of @xmath156 only slightly smaller than 1 would lead to entanglement creation before the light cone ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "same parameters and grey  scale code as in fig.[fig1 ] . ]    however , causality leads to strong restrictions of what should be possible in this respect : also in a classical field theory the retardation of the dipole ",
    "dipole interaction would be modified , and a electromagnetic interaction spreading faster than the speed of light is certainly not possible , regardless of whatever arrangement of conductors one might come up with in order to supress certain modes .    in @xcite",
    "it was proposed that two atoms can get entangled by coupling them for a time @xmath96 to the vacuum of a massless scalar relativistic field ( thus explicitly avoiding the effects of any effective induced interaction ) , and an experiment was proposed in @xcite to demonstrate the corresponding effect in ion - traps , namely the entangling of the internal degrees of freedom of two ions in an ion - string faster than the speed of sound in the ion - string .",
    "the vacuum case can be retrieved from the calculation presented here by setting @xmath150 , and replacing the @xmath160 function in eq.([fs ] ) by unity . since @xmath117 diverges then",
    ", it is more reasonable to use directly @xmath73 as time scale .",
    "this is achieved formally by substituting @xmath161 in eqs.([fs],[phis ] ) whereupon the functions depend only on @xmath162 up to an additional prefactor @xmath163 .",
    "the latter combines with the prefactor @xmath164 and reads then @xmath165 .",
    "the cut - off @xmath166 is replaced by @xmath167 . however , nothing changes about the fact that the function @xmath125 is proportional to a heaviside - theta function centered on the light - cone .",
    "thus , no phase accumulation is possible for @xmath96 , unless one uses a finite cut - off . in this case",
    "the heaviside theta function gets `` softened '' , which is physically plausible as now the heat - bath does not contain sufficiently small wave - lengths anymore to precisely locate bob s dqd .",
    "but even if in such a case one was to operate slightly before the light - cone , @xmath168 , one would still have to overcome the smallness of the prefactor @xmath165 .",
    "this seems to be excluded for atoms , as the distance between alice and bob would have to become smaller than the length attached to the atomic dipole moment @xmath6 , in which case the whole dipole approximation breaks down . in dqds one might hope to create states @xmath7 and @xmath8 with large amounts of charge , thus increasing artificially the dipole moments , but even for ten excess electrons in one well the dqds would have to be so close that the dipole approximation becomes doubtful .",
    "thus , within the above theoretical framework of fixed dqds with two degenerate energy levels dipole  coupled to bbr , there seems to be not much room for substantially entangling the atoms faster than the speed of light by coupling them for a time @xmath96 to the bbr , even at @xmath150 .",
    "as the function @xmath125 remains finite for @xmath169 , a different cut ",
    "off function has little influence on @xmath125 ( besides the eventual removal of the oscillating terms mentioned earlier ) and therefore on the speed of entanglement generation .",
    "however , since @xmath170 diverge for @xmath83 , the cut  off function can change the maximum amount of entanglement .",
    "let us suppose that the cut  off function to be used in eq.([fs ] ) is equal to unity for @xmath171 and equal to a function @xmath172 for @xmath173 . for @xmath92 ,",
    "the @xmath174 can be replaced by unity without impacting the following scaling arguments .",
    "also , the strongest diverging @xmath73dependent part is given by @xmath175 which even for @xmath176 remains finite .",
    "the only remaining question is then , if a different cut  off function changes significantly the @xmath72dependent behavior of @xmath170 , and in particular , if for @xmath177 @xmath170 always remain finite . to answer this question",
    "observe that for @xmath178 , @xmath179 thus , if the cut ",
    "off function decays fast enough to make the integral finite , it will be finite for all times . more specifically ,",
    "if @xmath180 , @xmath181 needs to be larger than two , and the upper bound in ( [ absch ] ) is then of the order @xmath182 , which is completely negligible compared to the dominating @xmath86 behavior from @xmath171 .",
    "therefore , the results obtained , in particular the entanglement for large @xmath72 , are robust against a change of the cut ",
    "off function .",
    "the cmb or the black body radiation ( bbr ) in a box  shaped cavity can be regarded as two independent heat baths , which couple differently to two spatially separated dqds .",
    "two spatially separated , non  interacting quantum systems can get entangled by interacting with the cmb or the same bbr .",
    "however , the effects of both heat baths cancel to large extent . as a result",
    ", entanglement is created only very slowly , with a first maximum entanglement arriving at a time @xmath1 that scales like the 3rd power of the distance @xmath2 between the quantum systems .",
    "the effect can be understood as originating from an effectively induced dipole - dipole interaction , and consequently is retarded by the propagation of a light signal .",
    "_ acknowledgment : _ i thank jaewan kim and sangchul oh for useful discussions , and benni reznik for useful correspondance .",
    "i derive here the expression for the electric field operator , eq.([efield ] ) .",
    "starting point is the standard representation of the quantum operator of the electric field for periodic boundary conditions @xcite , @xmath183 with @xmath184 , unit polarization vectors @xmath185 ( @xmath25 ) , and the creation and annihilation operators @xmath186 and @xmath187 , respectively .",

    "<S> two non  interacting quantum systems which couple to a common environment with many degrees of freedom initially in thermal equilibrium can become entangled due to the indirect interaction mediated through this heat bath . </S>",
    "<S> i examine here the dynamics of reservoir induced entanglement for a heat bath consisting of a thermal electro  magnetic radiation field , such as black body radiation or the cosmic microwave background , and show how the effect can be understood as result of an effective induced interaction . </S>"
