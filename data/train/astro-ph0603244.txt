    "because lyman @xmath25 emission is easily quenched by dust , the lyman alpha emitting galaxies ( laes ) are often characterized as protogalaxies experiencing their first burst of star formation @xcite .",
    "however , the differing behavior of lyman @xmath25 and continuum photons encountering dust and neutral gas makes it possible for older galaxies to exhibit lyman @xmath25 emission when morphology and kinematics favor the escape of these photons ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "hence the laes could instead represent an older population with actively star - forming regions .",
    "laes offer the chance to probe the bulk of the high - redshift galaxy luminosity function as the strong emission line allows spectroscopic confirmation of objects dimmer than the continuum limit @xmath15 .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "using the conversion between sfr and x - ray flux given by @xcite , the upper limit on the average star formation rate per object is 200@xmath21 m@xmath18 yr@xmath4 , which is clearly consistent with the observed sfr .",
    "none of our lae spectra show broad emission line widths ( @xmath81 km s@xmath4 ) that would be inconsistent with the energetics of star formation .",
    "we therefore expect that very few lae candidates contain luminous agn which dominate their lyman @xmath25 or continuum emission .",
    "our survey covers @xmath82 or @xmath83mpc@xmath84 , yielding an lae number density of @xmath7@xmath8mpc@xmath9 , equivalent to @xmath85 deg@xmath86 per unit redshift .",
    "the survey volume was computed using the filter bandpass fwhm=50 , and the five candidates without confirmed redshifts were assumed to be laes .",
    "the error bars account for variations in the lae abundance within our survey volume caused by large - scale structure assuming a bias of 2 .",
    "the true uncertainties could be bigger given the large fluctuations in density observed for laes at @xmath30 by @xcite .",
    "combining the measured number density and using the best - fit star formation rate per object of 6@xmath21 m@xmath18 yr@xmath4 , we find a cosmic star formation rate density of @xmath22 m@xmath18 yr@xmath4mpc@xmath9 .",
    "this is significantly less than the lbg sfr density @xcite , but it underestimates the total lae contribution due to our requirements of high equivalent width and relatively bright @xmath87 flux designed to select a pure sample amenable to spectroscopic confirmation .",
    "a detailed calculation of the lae luminosity function at @xmath0 , which can be integrated to give a fuller estimate of the sfr density , will be given in c.  gronwall et al .",
    "( in prep ) .",
    "the number density , stellar masses , star formation rates , and median uv continuum fluxes found for laes are within a factor of three of those predicted by @xcite ; the agreement is even better when our equivalent width threshold is accounted for .",
    "the only strong disagreement seen versus these models is their claimed escape fraction of 0.02 for lyman @xmath25 photons versus our lower limit of 0.2 ( and best - fit of 0.8 ) implied by the comparison of star formation rates determined from the observed lyman @xmath25 luminosities and sed modelling .",
    "this discrepancy could be resolved by using a larger escape fraction and a standard imf instead of the top - heavy imf assumed in the models .",
    "our determination that @xmath26 laes are predominantly blue contrasts with the results of @xcite and @xcite that laes in blank fields at @xmath88 are typically red , ( @xmath89)@xmath90 .",
    "this differs from the median value of ( @xmath91 ) @xmath92 for our spectroscopically confirmed laes and the median color ( @xmath93 ) @xmath92 measured by @xcite .",
    "the difference seems unlikely to be caused by evolution in the lae population from @xmath26 to @xmath94 given the small increase in the age of the universe .    at @xmath29 ,",
    "lala @xcite reported that a majority of lae candidates had ew@xmath95  , providing evidence of a top - heavy imf possibly caused by population iii stars , although equivalent widths this high could also result from highly anisotropic radiative transfer due to the differing effects of dust and gas on lyman @xmath25 and uv - continuum photons .",
    "this photometric measurement is sensitive to considerable scatter when the sample is selected in the narrow - band and the broad - band imaging is shallow , as broad - band non - detections can receive extremely large implied equivalent widths , and this is guaranteed to occur for any spurious narrow - band detections . indeed ,",
    "when @xmath96 upper limits on the continuum flux were used , only 10% of their @xmath29 sample had such high ews , and @xmath97% of the confirmed objects have ew@xmath95   @xcite .",
