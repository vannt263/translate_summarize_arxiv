    "weak localization is a coherent phenomenon in the low - temperature transport in disordered systems .",
    "transport in such systems is realized by various trajectories , including a special class of trajectories with closed loops .",
    "the underlying physics of the weak localization is the enhancement of the backscattering amplitude which results from the constructive interference of the waves propagating along the loops in the opposite directions ( clockwise and counterclockwise ) .",
    "since interference increases the backscattering amplitude , quantum conductivity correction is negative and is proportional to the ratio of the de  broglie wavelength to the mean free path  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , this correction diverges logarithmically at low temperatures in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) case .",
    "such a divergence is a precursor of the strong localization and reflects universal symmetry properties of the system .",
    "dephasing processes suppress interference and , consequently , strongly affect the conductivity correction .",
    "specifically , the typical size of interfering paths is limited by the time of electron dephasing , @xmath0 . at low temperatures ,",
    "the dephasing rate is dominated by inelastic electron - electron collisions .",
    "the phase space for such collisions decreases with lowering temperature .",
    "therefore , one can probe dephasing processes by measuring the temperature dependence of conductivity in the weak - localization regime  @xcite .",
    "another possibility to affect the interference - induced quantum correction to the conductivity is application of magnetic field .",
    "the aharonov - bohm effect introduces a phase difference for the waves traveling along the closed loop in the opposite directions .",
    "this phase difference equals to a double magnetic flux passing through the loop .",
    "the anomalous magnetoconductivity allows one to extract the dephasing time even more accurately than the temperature measurements since the low - field magnetoconductivity is not masked by other effects  @xcite .",
    "since weak localization is caused by the interference of paths related to each other by time inversion , it is extremely sensitive to spin properties of interfering particles . in systems with spin - orbit coupling ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : regimes ] ) , an additional spin - dependent phase is acquired by electrons passing the loops clock- and anti - clockwise . as a result ,",
    "the interference depends on the electron spin states before and after passing the loop .",
    "importantly , in the presence of spin - orbit coupling , the interference becomes destructive , resulting in a positive correction to the conductivity .",
    "this interference effect is called weak antilocalization .",
    "magnetic field suppresses this correction making the conductivity smaller than in zero field , i.e. the magnetoconductivity is negative  @xcite .",
    "theory of weak localization developed in 1980 s for diffusive systems allowed one to explain a number of experimental data in various metallic and semiconductor structures  @xcite .",
    "spin - orbit interaction has been treated as spin relaxation which adds an additional channel for dephasing of the triplet contributions to the quantum corrections  @xcite . however , this approach is insufficient for 2d semiconductor heterostructures with the linear - in - momentum spin - orbit splitting of the spectrum . the relevant theory of weak localization has been developed in the middle of 1990 s  @xcite .",
    "it describes very well experimental data  @xcite .    with increasing the magnetic field , the magnetic length @xmath1 becomes smaller than the mean free path @xmath2 .",
    "this regime of weak localization can not be treated within the model of a diffusive electron motion along large scattering paths . by contrast",
    ", the main contribution to the interference correction comes from short ballistic trajectories with a few scattering events  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the ballistic regime can be more easily achieved in high - quality heterostructures with high electron mobility .",
    "the point is that in such structures , the interval of fields , where @xmath3 but at the same time the magnetic field is classically weak , can be very wide .",
    "positive magnetoconductivity due to weak localization in the ballistic regime was calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the presence of a moderate spin - orbit splitting of the spectrum ,",
    "the `` ballistic '' magnetoconductivity was obtained in refs .",
    "these results were used to fit the weak - localization  @xcite and weak - antilocalization  @xcite data in various high - mobility heterostructures .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the spin - orbit splitting was assumed to be comparable to or even larger than the momentum scattering rate @xmath4 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : regimes ] . in this case , the spin dynamics can be well described by electron spin rotations in the effective momentum - dependent magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "however , when the spin - orbit splitting becomes of the order of the fermi energy , effects of spin - orbit interaction on the electron orbital motion can not be neglected in the calculation of the conductivity correction .    recently",
    ", 2d systems have become available where such an ultra - strong splitting can be realized .",
    "examples are electrons near the surface of polar semiconductors and at lao / sto interfaces , or holes in hgte - based quantum well structures with a large spin - orbit splitting  @xcite . in such systems ,",
