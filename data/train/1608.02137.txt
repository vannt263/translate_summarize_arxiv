    "in this paper , we establish the following rigidity result for non - compact , complete self - expanders to the inverse mean curvature flow .

    "an immersion @xmath2 from an @xmath3-dimensional orientable manifold @xmath4 into @xmath5 is a _ self - expander _ to the inverse mean curvature flow ( imcf ) if there exists a constant @xmath6 so that @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the scalar mean curvature induced by the unit normal vector field @xmath9 on @xmath4 .",
    "the mean curvature @xmath10 is assumed to be non - zero everywhere on a self - expander to imcf . in particular , the support function @xmath11 is non - zero everywhere and equation  ( [ eq : imcf_expander ] ) is equivalent to the nonlinear elliptic equation @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the laplace - beltrami operator induced on @xmath4 by the immersion @xmath14 .    the round spheres ( @xmath15 ) and round cylinders ( @xmath16 ) are examples of self - expanders to imcf in @xmath17 .",
    "gerhardt @xcite and urbas @xcite showed that compact , star - shaped , initial surfaces with strictly positive mean curvature converge under imcf , after suitable rescaling , to a round sphere .",
    "recently , the first named author , g. wheeler , and the third named author @xcite proved that round spheres are the only closed self - expanders . while the round spheres are rigid among the compact self - expanders , there is no such rigidity for the round cylinders . even in the class of hypersurfaces with rotational symmetry , there are known examples of non - compact , complete self - expanders different than the round cylinders .",
    "g. huisken and t. ilmanen @xcite constructed a complete , rotationally symmetric , self - expander with one end which is asymptotic to a cylinder ( see @xcite for a graphical plot ) . in @xcite , examples of complete , rotationally symmetric , expanding topological cylinders with two different ends , called _",
    "infinite bottles _ , were constructed ( see figure [ fig_immersed ] ) . in view of these known examples of rotationally symmetric self - expanders to imcf with asymptotically cylindrical ends , the conclusion of theorem  [ thm : main : intro ] is essentially sharp .",
    "this is in contrast to l. wang s uniqueness result @xcite for _ self - shrinkers _ to the _ mean curvature flow _ with asymptotically cylindrical ends .",
    ".,height=100 ]    our proof of theorem  [ thm : main : intro ] is essentially motivated by the role of the stability operator in the classical theory of hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature .",
    "for instance , l. j. alas , r. lpez , and b. palmer @xcite exploited the jacobi field induced by the rotation vector field to show that the only stable constant mean curvature surfaces of genus zero in @xmath18 with circular boundary are the spherical caps or the flat disks .",
    "in our situation , we construct two independent kernel functions of the linearized operator of the soliton equation , induced by rotations and dilations , respectively .",
    "this is done in section  [ sec : kernel ] .",
    "then , we utilize these kernel functions and the asymptotic behavior of our solitons in a maximum principle argument in section  [ sec : main ] to establish the rotational rigidity . our proof is also motivated by recent results on the rigidity of various geometric solitons , such as steady ricci solitons by s. brendle @xcite , expanding ricci solitons by o. chodosh @xcite , khler - ricci solitons by o. chodosh and the second named author @xcite , shrinking ricci solitons by b. kotschwar and l. wang @xcite , shrinkers to the mean curvature flow by m. rimoldi @xcite , and translators to the mean curvature flow by r. haslhofer @xcite . finally , we mention the following references for background on the inverse mean curvature flow and its intriguing geometric applications : huisken - ilmanen @xcite , huisken - ilmanen @xcite , bray - neves @xcite , akutagawa - neves @xcite , kwong - miao @xcite , li - wei @xcite , brendle - hung - wang @xcite , guo - li - wu @xcite , lambert - scheuer @xcite , and allen @xcite .",

    "we will first establish in lemma [ kernel ] that the inner products @xmath21 and @xmath22 both satisfy the same elliptic equation . the main result of this paper will then be proved by using the strong maximum principle .    to begin",

    "we will make use of the following well - known evolution equations :    [ lma : evolutions ] let @xmath34 be a smooth one - parameter family of immersions in @xmath5 satisfying the normal evolution @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a smooth function and @xmath37 is the unit normal .",

    "in this section , we prove that a complete immersed self - expander to the inverse mean curvature flow , which has one end asymptotic to a cylinder , or has two ends asymptotic to two coaxial cylinders , must be rotationally symmetric . our proof requires the notion of asymptocity , which guarantees that the two kernel functions on the self - expander , induced by rotations and dilations , uniformly converge to corresponding constant kernel functions on the asymptotic cylinder(s ) , respectively .",
    "we shall introduce the following geometric definition of cylindrical asymptoticity , which implies the analytic uniform convergence of the kernel functions .",

    "if we strengthen the growth assumption [ growth2 ] by @xmath107 then , by observing the pointwise estimation , at each point @xmath108 , @xmath109 we find that combining [ growth1 ] and ( [ growth2str ] ) yields the third growth assumption [ growth3 ] .    instead of the _ geometric _ growth conditions in defintion [ asmp ] , we are also able to impose that the normal distance function @xmath110 defined on the round cylinder satisfies the _ analytic _ growth conditions :          * @xmath1 has only one end which is asymptotic , in the sense of defiition  [ asmp ] , to a round cylinder ; or * @xmath1 has only two ends which are asymptotic , in the sense of defiition  [ asmp ] , to two coaxial round cylinders .",
    "let @xmath117 denote the asymptotic cylinder of radius @xmath92 in @xmath43 .",
    "since the inverse mean curvature flow is invariant under rigid motions in @xmath18 , without loss of generality , we can take the @xmath44-axis as the axis of the rotational symmetry of @xmath117 .",
    "suppose that the self - expander @xmath94 has an end @xmath93 which is asymptotic to the cylinder @xmath118 as in definition [ asmp ] . on this cylinder @xmath117 ,",
    "the rotation function and the support function are given by @xmath119 and @xmath120 . as the end @xmath93 of @xmath1 is asymptotic to @xmath117 , by letting @xmath106 on @xmath93 , we find that @xmath47 converges uniformly to @xmath121 , and @xmath11 converges uniformly to @xmath122 .",
    "( the proof of uniform convergence of @xmath47 at infinity uses a similar estimation to ( [ g2str ] ) of remark [ gna ] . )",
    "recall that the support function @xmath22 does not vanish on a self - expander to imcf .",
    "in particular , @xmath22 is uniformly bounded away from zero on @xmath4 , and so the quotient : @xmath123 converges uniformly to @xmath121 as @xmath106 .",
    "hence , even though @xmath1 is non - compact , we find that the bounded function @xmath124 must attain a finite global maximum value on @xmath4 .    to show that @xmath1 is rotationally symmetric , we prove that @xmath125 and hence @xmath21 vanish on @xmath4 .",
    "seeking a contradiction , suppose @xmath125 is non - zero somewhere on @xmath4 .",
    "as @xmath125 converges uniformly to @xmath121 at infinity , the quotient function @xmath125 will achieve either a positive global maximum value or a negative global minimum value on the whole surface @xmath4 . by applying the quotient identity @xmath126 with @xmath127 and @xmath128 , and combining with the two identities and in lemma [ kernel ]",
    ", we can easily derive the equality @xmath129 on @xmath4 . since the quotient function @xmath130 achieves either a finite global minimum or maximum value , the strong maximum ( minimum ) principle guarantees that @xmath125 must be a non - zero constant function .",
    "this contradicts the behavior of @xmath125 as @xmath106 .",
    "hence , @xmath131 and @xmath132 on @xmath4 .",
    "since @xmath21 vanishes on @xmath4 , the rotation vector field @xmath133 is tangent to @xmath1 everywhere . as is well - known ( for instance , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) ) , one can easily check that , for any given point @xmath134 , the maximal integral curve of the vector field @xmath20 passing through @xmath135 must be the horizontal circle having the radius @xmath136 and the center located in the @xmath44-axis .",
    "hence , the self - expander is invariant under the rotations with respect to the @xmath44-axis .",
    "the two - end case can be proved in the same way . if @xmath137 and @xmath138 are the only two ends of @xmath4 which are asymptotic to two coaxial cylinders , we still have @xmath47 converges uniformly to @xmath121 on both ends @xmath137 and @xmath138 , and that @xmath22 is uniformly bounded away from @xmath121 on @xmath4 .",
    "the same argument above shows the quotient @xmath125 and hence @xmath47 vanish on the whole @xmath4 .    in higher dimensions ,",
    "the group of rotations about the axis of the round cylinder @xmath139 in @xmath5 is isomorphic to @xmath140 .",

    "clearly , we have @xmath143 for the cylinder @xmath144",
    ". then , we can adapt the same argument in the @xmath145 case to show @xmath146 on @xmath4 .",
