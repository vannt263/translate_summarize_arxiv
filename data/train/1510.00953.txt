    "proteins are essential building blocks of living organisms .",
    "they function as catalyst , structural elements , chemical signals , receptors , etc . the molecular mechanism of protein functions are closely related to their structures .",
    "the study of structure - function relationship is the holy grail of biophysics and has attracted enormous effort in the past few decades .",
    "the understanding of such a relationship enables us to predict protein functions from structure or amino acid sequence or both , which remains major challenge in molecular biology .",
    "intensive experimental investigation has been carried out to explore the interactions among proteins or proteins with other biomolecules , e.g. , dnas and/or rnas . in particular , the understanding of protein - drug interactions is of premier importance to human health .",
    "a wide variety of theoretical and computational approaches has been proposed to understand the protein structure - function relationship .",
    "one class of approaches is biophysical . from the point of view of biophysics , protein structure , function , dynamics and transport are , in general , dictated by protein interactions .",
    "quantum mechanics ( qm ) is based on the fundamental principle , and offers the most accurate description of interactions among electrons , photons , atoms and even molecules .",
    "although qm methods have unveiled many underlying mechanisms of reaction kinetics and enzymatic activities , they typically are computationally too expensive to do for large biomolecules . based on classic physical laws , molecular mechanics ( mm ) @xcite can , in combination with fitted parameters , simulate the physical movement of atoms or molecules for relatively large biomolecular systems like proteins quite precisely .",
    "however , it can be computationally intractable for macromoelcular systems involving realistic biological time scales . many time - independent methods like normal mode analysis ( nma ) @xcite , elastic network model ( enm ) @xcite , graph theory @xcite and flexibility - rigidity index ( fri ) @xcite are proposed to capture features of large biomolecules .",
    "variational multiscale methods @xcite are another class of approaches that combine atomistic description with continuum approximations .",
    "there are well developed servers for predicting protein functions based on three - dimensional ( 3d ) structures @xcite or models from the homology modeling ( here homology is in biological sense ) of amino acid sequence if 3d structure is not yet available @xcite .",
    "another class of important approaches , bioinformatical methods , plays a unique role for the understanding of the structure - function relationship .",
    "these data - driven predictions are based on similarity analysis .",
    "the essential idea is that proteins with similar sequences or structures may share similar functions .",
    "also , based on sequential or structural similarity , proteins can be classified into many different groups .",
    "once the sequence or structure of a novel protein is identified , its function can be predicted by assigning it to the group of proteins that share similarities to a good extent .",
    "however , the degree of similarity depends on the criteria used to measure similarity or difference .",
    "many measurements are used to describe similarity between two protein samples .",
    "typical approaches use either sequence or physical information , or both . among them , sequence alignment can describe how closely the two proteins are related .",
    "protein blast @xcite , clustalw2 @xcite , and other software packages can preform global or local sequence alignments .",
    "based on sequence alignments , various scoring methods can provide the description of protein similarity @xcite .",
    "additionally , sequence features such as sequence length and occurrence percentage of a specific amino acid can also be employed to compare proteins .",
    "many sequence based features can be derived from the position - specific scoring matrix ( pssm ) @xcite . moreover",
    ", structural information provides an efficient description of protein similarity as well .",
    "structure alignment methods include rigid , flexible and other methods .",
    "the combination of different structure alignment methods and different measurements such as root - mean - square deviation ( rmsd ) and z - score gives rise to various ways to quantify the similarity among proteins .",
    "as per structure information , different physical properties such as surface area , volume , free energy , flexible - rigidity index ( fri ) @xcite , curvature @xcite , electrostatics @xcite etc . can be calculated .",
    "a continuum model , poisson boltzmann ( pb ) equation delivers quite accurate estimation for electrostatics of biomolecules .",
    "there are many efficient and accurate pb solvers including pbeq @xcite , mibpb @xcite , etc .",
    "together with physical properties , one can also extract geometrical properties from structure information .",
    "these properties include coordinates of atoms , connections between atoms such as covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds , molecular surfaces @xcite and curvatures @xcite .",
    "these various approaches reveal information of different scales from local atom arrangement to global architecture .",
    "physical and geometrical properties described above add different perspective to analyze protein similarities .",
    "due to the advance in bioscience and biotechnology , biomolecular structure date sets are growing at an unprecedented rate .",
    "for example , the http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do[protein data bank ( pdb ) ] has accumulated more than a hundred thousand biomolecular structures .",
    "the prediction of the protein structure - function relationship from such huge amount of data can be extremely challenging .",
    "additionally , an eve - growing number of physical or sequence features are evaluated for each data set or amino - acid residue , which adds to the complexity of the data - driven prediction . to automatically analyze excessively large data sets in molecular biology , many machine learning methods",
    "have been developed @xcite .",
    "these methods are mainly utilized for the classification , regression , comparison and clustering of biomolecular data .",
    "clustering is an unsupervised learning method which divides a set of inputs into groups without knowing the groups beforehand .",
    "this method can unveil hidden patterns in the data set .",
    "classification is a supervised learning method , in which , a classifier is trained on a given training set and used to do prediction for new observations .",
    "it assigns observation to one of several pre - determined categories based on knowledge from training data set in which the label of observations is known .",
    "popular methods for classification include support vector machine ( svm ) @xcite , artificial neural network ( ann ) @xcite , deep learning @xcite , etc . in classification ,",
    "each observation in training the set has a feature vector that describes the observation from various perspectives and a label that indicates to which group the observation belongs . a model trained on the training set indicates to which group a new observation belongs with feature vector and unknown label . to improve the speed of classification and reduce effect from irrelevant features",
    ", many feature selection procedures have been proposed @xcite .",
    "machine learning approach are successfully used for protein hot spot prediction @xcite .",
    "the data - driven analysis of the protein structure - function relationship is compromised by the fact that same protein may have different conformations which possess different properties or delivers different functions . for instance , hemoglobins have taut form with low affinity to oxygen and relaxed form with high affinity to oxygen ; and ion channels often have open and close states .",
    "different conformations of a given protein may only have minor differences in their local geometric configurations .",
    "these conformations share the same sequence and may have very similar physical properties .",
    "however , their minor structural differences might lead to dramatically different functions .",
    "therefore , apart from the conventional physical and sequence information , geometric and topological information can also play an important role in understanding the protein structure - function relationship .",
    "indeed , geometric information has been extensively used in the protein exploration . in contrast , topological information has been hardly employed in studying the protein structure - function relationship .    in general , geometric approaches are frequently inundated with too much geometric detail and are often prohibitively expensive for most realistic biomolecular systems , while traditional topological methods often incur in too much reduction of the original geometric and physical information .",
    "persistent homology , a new branch of applied topology , is able to bridge traditional geometry and topology .",
    "it creates a variety of topologies of a given object by varying a filtration parameter , such as a radius or a level set function . in the past decade",
    ", persistent homology has been developed as a new multiscale representation of topological features .",
    "the 0-th dimensional version was originally introduced for computer vision applications under the name  size function \" @xcite and the idea was also studied by robins @xcite .",
    "the persistent homology theory was formulated , together with an algorithm given , by edelsbrunner et al .",
    "@xcite , and a more general theory was developed by zomorodian and carlsson @xcite",
    ". there has since been significant theoretical development @xcite , as well as various computational algorithms @xcite .",
    "often , persistent homology can be visualized through barcodes @xcite , in which various horizontal line segments or bars are the homology generators which survive over filtration scales .",
    "persistence diagrams are another equivalent representation @xcite .",
    "computational homology and persistent homology have been applied to a variety of domains , including image analysis @xcite , chaotic dynamics verification @xcite , sensor network @xcite , complex network @xcite , data analysis @xcite , shape recognition @xcite and computational biology @xcite .",
    "compared with traditional computational topology @xcite and/or computational homology , persistent homology inherently has an additional dimension , the filtration parameter , which can be utilized to embed some crucial geometric or quantitative information into the topological invariants . the importance of retaining geometric information in topological analysis has been recognized @xcite , and topology has been advocated as a new approach for tackling big data sets @xcite .    recently , we have introduced persistent homology for mathematical modeling and prediction of nano particles , proteins and other biomolecules @xcite .",
    "we have proposed molecular topological fingerprint ( mtf ) to reveal topology - function relationships in protein folding and protein flexibility @xcite .",
    "we have employed persistent homology to predict the curvature energies of fullerene isomers @xcite , and analyze the stability of protein folding @xcite .",
    "more recently , we have introduced resolution based persistent topology @xcite .",
    "most recently , we have developed new multidimensional persistence , a topic that has attracted much attention in the past few years @xcite , to better bridge geometry and traditional topology and achieve better characterization of biomolecular data @xcite .",
    "we have also introduced the use of topological fingerprint for resolving ill - posed inverse problems in cryo - em structure determination @xcite .",
    "the objective of the present work is to explore the utility of mtfs for protein classification and analysis .",
    "we construct feature vectors based on mtfs to describe unique topological properties of protein in different scales , states and/or conformations .",
    "these topological feature vectors are further used in conjugation with the svm algorithm for the classification of proteins .",
    "we validate the proposed mtf - svm strategy by distinguishing different protein conformations , proteins with different local secondary structures , and proteins from different superfamilies or families .",
    "the performance of proposed topological method is demonstrated by a number of realistic applications , including protein binding analysis , ion channel study , etc .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as following .",
    "section [ sec : methods ] is devoted to the mathematical foundations for persistent homology and machine learning methods .",
    "we present a brief description of simplex and simplicial complex followed by basic concept of homology , filtration , and persistence in section [ persistenthomology ] .",
    "three different methods to get simplicial complex , vietoris - rips complex , alpha complex , and ech complex are discussed .",
