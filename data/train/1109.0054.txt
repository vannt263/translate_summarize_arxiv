    "one of the main scientific goals of the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) @xcite is to identify the brown dwarfs and low - mass stars closest to the sun .",
    "wise has now surveyed the entire sky in four mid - infrared filters , with @xmath3 of the sky included in the april 2011 preliminary data release . together with the three near - infrared two micron",
    "all - survey ( 2mass ) filters @xcite , the peaks of the spectral energy distributions of any nearby brown dwarfs with @xmath4k are well sampled @xcite .",
    "although hundreds of brown dwarfs with m , l , or t spectral types are now known , very few of them are closer than ten parsecs to the sun .",
    "the nearest known l dwarfs with trigonometric parallaxes are the l8 dwarf @xcite at @xmath5 pc @xcite , the l5 dwarf @xcite at @xmath6 pc @xcite , the l5 dwarf @xcite at @xmath7 pc @xcite , the l3.5 @xcite at @xmath8 pc @xcite , and the l5.5 dwarf @xcite at @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the lithium m9 brown dwarf @xcite , measured at @xmath10 pc @xcite , also deserves mention .",
    "other apparently nearby l dwarfs still lack reliable trigonometric parallaxes .",
    "the  blue \" l6 dwarf @xcite is thought to lie at @xmath11 or @xmath12 on the basis of photometry , while argue for a parallax distance of @xmath13 pc based on limited astrometry .",
    "@xcite list five additional l dwarfs with estimated distances between 9.4 and 9.9 pc .",
    "along with these warmer brown dwarfs , more than a dozen t dwarfs are known within ten parsecs .",
    "wise , whose filters are ideally suited for finding cold late - type t dwarfs , is already adding to the census : @xcite report a late - t dwarf at @xmath14 pc , while @xcite have identified two high proper motion , late - t dwarfs with @xmath15 pc using wise , 2mass and sdss .",
    "l dwarfs are useful probes for studying atmospheric properties of objects below @xmath16k , where clouds and dust opacity are important to the observed spectral energy distribution .",
    "in addition to their intrinsic interest , the latest - type l dwarfs are potential analogs to massive hot exoplanets such as those found around hr 8799 @xcite .",
    "because they are isolated in the field rather than found orbiting a nearby bright star they can be studied and characterized in great detail making them vital test beds for refinement .",
    "we have initiated an effort to detect high proper motion stars by comparing the wise and 2mass surveys . here , we report the identification of a bona - fide , nearby late - l brown dwarf , wisep j180026.60 + 013453 , as a result of this effort .",
    "we present our observations and data analysis in section  [ da ] .",
    "we discuss the possibility of binarity in section  [ bin ] .",
    "we selected wise sources with @xmath17 that were detected at w1 ( @xmath18 m ) , w2 ( @xmath19 m ) and w3 ( @xmath20 m ) with w1@xmath21 but had no 2mass counterpart within 3 arcseconds according to the wise preliminary source catalog .",
    "all stars or warm brown dwarfs with w1@xmath21 should have 2mass detections at k@xmath22 band .",
    "the wise , 2mass , and photographic ( digitized sky survey , dss ) images were examined by eye to look for proper motion candidates .",
    "almost all stars have w1@xmath23w2@xmath24 and w1@xmath23w3@xmath25 , but we noted a number of candidate proper motion objects with redder w1-w2 colors .",
    "most of these turned out to be known late - m or l dwarfs , but the source wisep j180026.60 + 013453.1 ( table  [ tab1 ] ) was previously unrecognized . as seen in figure  [ fig1 ] , this wise source may be paired with 2mass j18002648 + 0134565 ( j@xmath26 , h@xmath27 , k@xmath28 ) , which otherwise would not have a wise counterpart .",
    "we hereafter abbreviate the source name as w1800 + 0134 .",
    "the object was likely overlooked previously because it lies near the galactic plane ( @xmath2 ) , although the field is not very crowded .",
    "the apparent proper motion from 2mass to wise is @xmath29 arcsec yr@xmath0 and @xmath30 arcsec yr@xmath0 .",
    "this is relative to other stars in the image , with uncertainties based on the uncertainties of the wise and 2mass astrometry .",
    "however , because the observations were taken in 2010 march 20 - 23 ( wise ) and 2000 september 23 ( 2mass ) , parallax will affect the observed positions . using the novas v3.0",
    "software @xcite , we find that the offset in ra is 230 mas if w1800 + 0134 is 8.8 pc away , as estimated later . applying this correction , we find @xmath31 arcsec yr@xmath0 and @xmath32 arcsec yr@xmath0 .",
    "a possible very faint source is seen at the predicted position on the infrared ( i - band ) second palomar sky survey plate @xcite , but as expected for an l dwarf , it is not detected on the blue or red photographic plates ( figure  [ fig1 ] . )",
    "we also identify w1800 + 0134 with denis j180026.4 + 013457 , j@xmath33 and k@xmath34 in the 3rd release of the denis database .",
    "it was apparently not detected in the i band images , suggesting i@xmath35 .",
    "because the denis observation is close in time to the 2mass observation but is lower signal - to - noise , the detection confirms that w1800 has moved but was not included in the proper motion determination .",
    "a low - resolution irtf spex @xcite spectrum was obtained on 2011 june 22 ( ut ) and processed using spextool @xcite .",
    "spectra were obtained in prism mode using the 0.8  slit aligned at the parallactic angle .",
    "the resolution of the corresponding data spanning @xmath36 m was @xmath37 .",
    "conditions were clear and the seeing was 0.7  at k. we obtained 4 individual exposure times of 120s in an abba dither pattern along the slit .",
    "immediately after the science observations we observed the a0v star at a similar airmass for telluric corrections and flux calibration . internal flat - field and ar arc lamp exposures were acquired for pixel response and wavelength calibration , respectively .    our spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "we fit the spectrum to l and t dwarf templates also observed with spex .",
    "the best matching template is , classified as l8 in the optical by @xcite on the @xcite system and observed with spex by @xcite .",
    "the indices and spectral type relations defined by @xcite give l@xmath38 ( h2o - j ) , l@xmath39 ( h2o - h ) , l@xmath40 ( h2o - k ) , and l@xmath41 ( ch4-k ) , for a mean classification of l@xmath42 .",
    "the scatter is typical for near - infrared spectral typing of l dwarfs ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . combining the index type with the best - fit template type ,",
    "we adopt a near - infrared spectral classification of l7.5@xmath430.5 for w1800 + 0134 .    using the @xcite spectral type - absolute magnitude relationships , and propagating uncertainties through monte carlo analysis",
    ", we estimate a distance of @xmath1 pc from the 2mass j and k@xmath22 photometry .",
    "comparison of this estimated distance to the l dwarf distances listed in section  [ intro ] suggests w1800 + 0134 ranks as the sixth closest known l dwarf , but even a one parsec change could move it up to third or down to eighth or later . in any case",
    ", a trigonometric parallax is needed to realize w1800 + 0134 s scientific potential as one of the closest , brightest late - l dwarfs for detailed study .",
    "the @xcite polynomial fits to the @xcite temperature scale indicate that @xmath44k and @xmath45 for l7.5 dwarfs . with our estimated distance ,",
    "w1800 + 0134 is then @xmath46 . the @xcite relations , also based on a reanalysis of @xcite , make them somewhat cooler at @xmath47k . the tangential velocity ( @xmath48 km s@xmath0 ) is below the median for late l dwarfs @xcite .",
    "according to the @xcite models , for ages of 0.5 , 1 , and 5 gyr , the mass of a @xmath49k dwarf is @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 respectively ; the @xcite models give similar results .",
    "for all ages , it is below the hydrogen - burning limit",
    ". an optical spectrum could determine whether w1800 + 0134 is above or below the lithium - burning limit @xcite .",
    "some @xmath53 of very - low - mass binaries in magnitude - limited samples are typically resolved as doubles @xcite .",
    "if w1800 + 0134 were a near - equal luminosity double , the estimated distance would increase to @xmath54 pc .",
    "the low - resolution spectrum shows some evidence of structure in the h - band around the region of the 1.6 @xmath55 ch@xmath56 band , but no indication of ch@xmath56 at k - band ( see figure  [ fig2 ] . ) unresolved l dwarf plus t dwarf binary spectra frequently show this pattern of ch@xmath56 onset in the near - infrared @xcite . to investigate this possibility , we compared the spex spectrum to combinations of l and t dwarf binary templates from the spex prism spectral libraries , following the procedures described in @xcite .",
    "the best fit binary has the same @xmath57 residual as the best fit single source ; as such , there is no statistically robust evidence of w1800 + 0134 being an l plus t dwarf binary .",
    "the 2mass j - k@xmath58 color is neither unusually blue nor red compared to other l7-l8 dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the denis non - detection at i - band ( corresponding to @xmath59 ) is also consistent with the observed ( @xmath60 ) colors of other l7-l8 dwarfs @xcite . to assess",
    "whether the wise colors are typical , we have searched for known objects with an l7 , l7.5 , or l8 classification in the wise preliminary database with uncertainties less than 0.1 in w1 and w2 and 0.2 in w3 .",
    "the seven matching dwarfs are listed in table  [ tab2 ] . the observed mean and standard deviations of the apparently single objects are w1@xmath23w2 @xmath61 and w2@xmath23w3@xmath62 , consistent with w1800 + 0134 s colors ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) . the doubles and are somewhat redder but the uncertainties in w@xmath65 are large ( 0.08 and 0.17 respectively . )",
    "we note for completeness that we found no other common proper motion companions within 30 arcminutes of w1800 + 0134 , in wise or 2mass , ruling out widely - separated main sequence to late - t brown dwarf companions to a projected separation of 15,000 au .",
    "we have identified a previously overlooked bright and nearby l7.5 dwarf , near the galactic plane . together with the recent discoveries of the m9 at 9.6 pc ( @xmath66 ; @xcite ) , the t6 at 4.9 pc ( @xmath67 ; @xcite ) , the t9 at 4.1 pc ( @xmath68 ; @xcite ) , and the t9 at 6 - 10 pc ( @xmath69 ; @xcite ) , it is clear that multi - color , multi - survey searches for nearby brown dwarfs in the galactic plane region are now feasible .",
    "such objects are important because their proximity enables more detailed studies of the physical properties of brown dwarfs , as well as any potential planetary companions . as a very bright late - l dwarf with normal colors , studies of w1800 + 0134 s cloud properties through variability and polarization measurements",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ) , and rotation through high - resolution spectroscopy ( e.g. , @xcite ) , will be helpful in characterizing the structure and dynamics of cloudy atmospheres at the l / t transition , and will be relevant to exploring the cloud properties of hot exoplanets @xcite .",
