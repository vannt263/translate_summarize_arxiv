    "the determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy is one of the most interesting open issues in neutrino physics .",
    "present data allow for the two possibilities normal hierarchy ( nh ) and inverted hierarchy ( ih ) , which are conventionally parametrized by the sign of the difference of the mass - squares of the first and third neutrino mass eigenstates : @xmath5 for nh and @xmath6 for ih . identifying which of these two possibilities is realized in nature is of great importance for our understanding of the neutrino mass mechanism , the relation of neutrinos to the charged fermions , and the problem of flavour in general .",
    "nevertheless , the determination of the sign of @xmath7 turns out to be experimentally challenging .",
    "the most promising way seems to be to explore the matter effect in neutrino oscillations  @xcite .",
    "this can be done with long - baseline experiments  @xcite , atmospheric neutrinos  @xcite , or supernova neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "alternative methods to determine the hierarchy , not based on the matter effect , have been proposed  @xcite , but they turn out to be extremely challenging , if not impossible in practice .    the usual strategy to determine the mass hierarchy in long - baseline experiments is to consider configurations where the matter effect is _ strong _ , with baselines as long as possible , ideally several 1000  km ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent work ) , and neutrino energies close to ( or above ) the resonance energy  @xcite , which for typical densities of earth matter and @xmath8  ev@xmath9 is around 10  gev .",
    "the basic idea is to observe the effect of the resonance , which occurs for neutrinos in case of nh and anti - neutrinos for ih .",
    "hence , the discrimination of the two hierarchies is based on the difference of the matter effect in cp - conjugated oscillation channels , e.g. , @xmath3 and @xmath4 oscillations .",
    "the ultimate setup to explore this effect is certainly a neutrino factory with one or two baselines of several thousand km , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent study .",
    "other options are intense super beam experiments with a detector at a baseline @xmath10  km  @xcite , or very long - baseline high gamma beta beam experiments  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will consider a different strategy , and discuss the possibility to determine the mass hierarchy with experiments in the regime of _ small _ matter effect .",
    "we will consider experiments with baselines in the range 100  km  @xmath11  km and in the energy range of 300  mev  @xmath12  few  gev . in this regime",
    "the size of the matter effect is typically a few percent .",
    "we point out that if information from all four cp and t - conjugate oscillation channels @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , is available such small effects can be explored efficiently in order to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "the basic observation is that the so - called sign - degenerate solution  @xcite , which prevents the determination of the mass hierarchy , moves in opposite directions in the plane of @xmath13 and @xmath14  for t - conjugate channels .",
    "this effect has been observed in ref .",
    "@xcite in a simulation of cern based beta beam and super beam experiments . here",
    "we discuss the underlying physics and point out the general principle without specializing to a specific experimental configuration .",
    "this method could be applied for example for the combination of generic beta beam ( @xmath15 ) and super beam ( @xmath16 ) experiments .",
    "furthermore , a low energy neutrino factory  @xcite with a detector ( or detectors ) capable of muon and electron charge identification would offer a place to apply this method .",
    "if charge identification for electrons is not possible , the neutrino factory ( providing the @xmath17 information ) could be combined with a @xmath16 super beam experiment  @xcite .",
    "the outline of the remainder of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : analytical ] we discuss the proposed hierarchy determination by considerations of the relevant oscillation probabilities .",
    "we discuss the resolution of the sign - degenerate solution by using analytical expressions for the probabilities and confirm the results by numerical calculations . in sec .",

    "as examples we combine the @xmath18 super beam experiments spl , t2hk , and no@xmath19a with a @xmath20 beta beam ( @xmath21 ) , all operating in the regime of relatively small matter effect .",
    "a summary is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "in this section we discuss how the sign - degeneracy can be resolved with cp and t - conjugated channels by considering the location of the degenerate solution in the plane of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "similar considerations can be found for example in refs .",
    "let us depart from an expression for the appearance oscillation probability in the @xmath22 sector , expanded to second order in the small parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 valid for constant matter density  @xcite : @xmath25 with the definitions @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the baseline , @xmath28 is the neutrino energy , and @xmath29 is the effective matter potential  @xcite .",
    "the signs @xmath30 describe the effects of cp - conjugation , t - conjugation , and the neutrino mass hierarchy , respectively : @xmath31 the matter effect enters via the parameter @xmath32 .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) that in the case of large matter effect @xmath33 the terms @xmath34 depend strongly on the type of the mass hierarchy , and for @xmath35 ( neutrinos and nh , or anti - neutrinos and ih ) a resonance is encountered for @xmath36  @xcite .    in the following",
    "we will focus on a different situation , namely the regime of small matter effect @xmath37 .",
    "numerically one finds for a matter density of 3  g/@xmath38 @xmath39 furthermore , we concentrate on experiments operating at the first oscillation maximum , which is characterized by @xmath40 , or @xmath41 eqs .",
    "( [ eq : a ] ) and ( [ eq : max ] ) imply that for experiments at baselines of 130  km , 295  km , 730  km the matter effect is of order 2% , 5% , 13% , respectively . and @xmath28 the matter effect is important can be found for example in ref .  @xcite . ]",
    "keeping this in mind it makes sense to expand the probability eq .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) also in the small quantity @xmath32 . to simplify the following equations we set @xmath42 and use the abbreviation @xmath43 then eq .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) becomes to first order in @xmath32 @xmath44 \\ , ,        \\label{eq : p2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first line is just the vacuum probability and the second line corresponds to the leading order matter effect correction .",
    "the reason why it is difficult to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy is a parameter degeneracy with @xmath45 and @xmath14  @xcite , i.e. , for given @xmath45 , @xmath14 , and sgn(@xmath7 ) in many situations the same probability can be obtained for the opposite sign of @xmath7 and different values @xmath46 and @xmath47 : @xmath48 assuming a given oscillation channel @xmath49 and neutrino and anti - neutrino data ( @xmath50 ) this is a system of two equations for the variables @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "if a solution to this system exists the mass hierarchy can not be determined .",
    "for example , in the case of vacuum oscillations it follows immediately from eq .",
    "( [ eq : p2 ] ) that the condition ( [ eq : deg ] ) can be fulfilled for @xmath51 and @xmath52  @xcite : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is given by the first line of eq .",

    "hence , for neutrino plus anti - neutrino data in one oscillation channel the leading order matter effect can not break the degeneracy .",
    "this is the reason why experiments at relatively small baselines ( @xmath0  km ) have very poor sensitivity to the mass hierarchy . )",
    "can be fulfilled exactly only for one energy .",
    "hence , in principle spectral information can be used to resolve the degeneracy .",
    "note , however , that this is an effect at third order in the small quantities @xmath63 .",
    "hence , it is difficult to obtain enough statistics to explore spectral information . ] in order to resolve the degeneracy one has to enter the regime of _ large _ matter effect , where the non - linear character of eq .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) becomes relevant and prevents a solution of the two conditions ( [ eq : deg ] ) for fixed @xmath49 and @xmath64 .",
    "however , the immediate conclusion from eq .",
    "( [ eq : deglin ] ) is that if all cp and t - conjugate channels are available one obtains four independent relations ( corresponding to @xmath50 and @xmath65 ) for the two variables @xmath61 and @xmath62 . obviously , in general such a system has no solution and hence the degeneracy is broken . to illustrate this",
    "explicitly let us consider for simplicity the case @xmath66 , i.e. , experiments exactly at the first oscillation maximum . then eq .",
    "( [ eq : deglin ] ) simplifies to @xmath67 for @xmath50 and given @xmath49 this system of equations has the solution @xmath68 the crucial observation from these expressions is that the signs of both , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , depend on the oscillation channel @xmath49 .",
    "hence , with increasing matter effect @xmath32 the location of the solution with the wrong hierarchy in the @xmath69 plane moves in opposite directions for @xmath18 and @xmath21 transitions .     for @xmath50 ( neutrinos / anti - neutrinos ) and @xmath65 ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the star indicates the assumed values for @xmath71  and @xmath14  for the nh , whereas the axes correspond to the primed parameters for the wrong hierarchy .",
    "the dots show the location of the degenerate solutions , where the curves for neutrinos and anti - neutrinos for fixed @xmath49 cross .",
    "the four panels correspond to different baselines , and the neutrino energy in each panel is determined by assuming the first oscillation maximum and @xmath72  ev@xmath9 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : max ] ) .",
    "[ fig : p],scaledwidth=80.0% ]    we have verified this behaviour by numerical calculations of the oscillation probability for constant matter ( without any expansion in small quantities ) . based on such calculations",

    "[ fig : p ] .",
    "the appearance probability is calculated for nh and the parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( marked as a star ) .",
    "then the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : p ] correspond to the set of values @xmath75 and @xmath47 leading to the same probability but for ih . in each panel",
    "there are four curves , corresponding to the four combinations of neutrinos / anti - neutrinos and @xmath70 .",
    "the dots show the location of the degenerate solutions , where the curves for neutrinos and anti - neutrinos for a given channel cross .",
    "the second crossing close to the original parameter values correspond to the so - called intrinsic degenerate solution  @xcite ( with the wrong hierarchy ) . for experiments at the first oscillation maximum this degeneracy is resolved quite efficiently by spectral information , and hence , in many cases it does not appear as a viable solution ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for an explicit discussion in the case of the t2hk experiment ) .",

    "( [ eq : degvac ] ) with @xmath77 , which makes the determination of the hierarchy impossible even if all cp and t - conjugated channels are available . by increasing the baseline ( and simultaneously choosing the energy to stay in the first oscillation maximum )",

    "@xcite . in this experiment",
    "the matter effect is somewhat larger than for the cern  memphys configuration , but still too small to explore the neutrino mass hierarchy .",

    "furthermore , the dislocation of the degeneracy for the super beam experiments from the vacuum value of @xmath14  is proportional to the baseline , i.e. , increasing in the order spl , t2hk , no@xmath19a .",
    "this behaviour shows that the combination of @xmath18 and @xmath21 experiments offers a promising synergy in resolving the sign - degeneracy .",

    "[ fig : d - th],scaledwidth=60.0% ]    let us stress that in each case a detailed quantitative study is necessary in order to fully assess the potential of this method .",
    "the final ability to disfavour the degenerate solution depends on many details which affect the size of the allowed regions for the individual experiments .",
    "for example , the relatively large allowed region for no@xmath19a seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : d - th ] , which is a consequence of the much smaller statistics compared to the other setups , will certainly limit the sensitivity , tough the best fit point of the degeneracy for no@xmath19a clearly follows the trend discussed above . for the spl / bb combination the effect discussed here",
    "has apparently not be found in refs .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : d - th ] that for spl+bb a slight enlargement of the allowed regions would be enough to corrupt the ability to resolve the sign - degeneracy .",
    "the size of the allowed regions depends rather sensitively on the details of the analysis ( see e.g. , fig .  6 of ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of spl ) . a possible reason for the differences with refs",
    ".  @xcite might be for example the assumptions on systematics ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : setups ] ) , or the inclusion of spectral information for appearance as well as disappearance channels , which has quite a significant impact on the size of the allowed regions  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : d - th ] we have assumed a `` true '' nh . if the true hierarchy is inverted the degenerate solutions for the @xmath18 and @xmath21 channels move into the opposite directions as in the case of a true nh .",
    "this follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : solution ] ) , where @xmath60 corresponds to the true sign of @xmath7 .",
    "of course , the complementarity between the t - conjugated channels remains independently of the true hierarchy .",
    "let us comment on the widely discussed strategy of using information from two @xmath18 experiments at similar @xmath92 but different baselines , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "such a situation is realized by the combination of t2k and no@xmath19a  @xcite or by placing a second detector in the no@xmath19a beam - line at a suitable off - axis angle , as proposed in ref .",
    "it is clear from the preceding discussion and from fig .",
    "[ fig : d - th ] that the synergy from such a combination is less effective than using @xmath21 information .",
    "the reason is that the degeneracies for two @xmath18 experiments move in the _ same _ direction in the @xmath86 space , only the size of the dislocation is different due to the different baselines .",
    "gev and a detector at large baselines @xmath93  km , far beyond the first oscillation maximum  @xcite .",
    "apart from the fact that in this case the matter effect can not be considered to be small , also the rich information from the energy spectrum at higher oscillation maxima can lead to a rather different behaviour of the sign - degenerate solution than discussed here . ]",
    "for which the ih can be excluded at @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) if the true hierarchy is normal , as a function of @xmath14  ( left ) and the fraction of all possible values of @xmath14  ( right ) .",
    "the dashed lines correspond to the super beam experiments spl , t2hk , no@xmath19a , whereas for the solid lines each of these super beams is combined with the beta beam . for comparison also the combination no@xmath19a+t2hk is shown .",
    "[ fig : sens],scaledwidth=90.0% ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sens ] we show how the combination of the super beam experiments spl , t2hk , and no@xmath19a with the @xmath20 beta beam significantly enhances the sensitivity to the mass hierarchy due to the @xmath96 synergy .",
    "the dashed curves show the sensitivities of the super beams alone .",
    "one observes that these experiments can assess the mass hierarchy only in a certain range of @xmath14  values , and there is no sensitivity even for @xmath97 for 75% ( 50% ) of all values of @xmath14  for spl ( t2hk , no@xmath19a ) .",
    "note that no@xmath19a and t2hk have a rather similar sensitivity , where no@xmath19a has the advantage of the longer baseline of 812  km , whereas the short baseline of t2hk of 295  km is compensated by the large statistics implied by the 4  mw beam and 500  kt detector .",
    "the main limitation of spl is of course the short baseline of 130  km .",
    "when these experiments are combined with the bb the sensitivity is significantly improved , see solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : sens ] .",
    "the dependence on @xmath14  practically disappears and a stable sensitivity is obtained for @xmath98 .",
    "we have assumed that the true hierarchy is normal , but we have checked that for a true ih the results are very similar . ] the effect is most remarkable for spl+bb  @xcite , since none of these experiments on its own has any notable sensitivity . indeed , in the parameter range shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sens ] there is no sensitivity for bb alone .",
    "the sensitivity of the spl+bb combination fully emerges from the complementarity of t - conjugated channels in the small matter effect regime . also for t2hk and no@xmath19a",
    "the effect is clearly visible , and again the larger baseline of no@xmath19a is compensated by statistics in t2hk . for comparison",
    "we show also the combination no@xmath19a+t2hk ( without bb ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : sens ] ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for detailed discussions of the case no@xmath19a + t2k phase  i ) .",
    "also in this case the sensitivity improves , however the complementarity is much less pronounced , a dependence on @xmath14  remains , and the effect is more similar to the addition of statistics than a true synergy ( see also the corresponding discussion related to fig .  [",
    "fig : d - th ] ) .    as a side remark",
    "let us mention the possibility pointed out in the second paper of ref .",
    "@xcite , that very accurate measurements of the neutrino mass - squared difference in @xmath99 and @xmath100 disappearance experiments allow in principle to distinguish between nh and ih ( even in vacuum ) . in the beta beam / super beam combination both disappearance probabilities @xmath101 and @xmath102 are observed .",
    "however , we have checked that for the experiments considered here numerically this effect is completely negligible , and practically the full sensitivity shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sens ] emerges from the matter effect in the appearance channels .",
    "in this letter we have considered neutrino oscillation experiments operating at the first oscillation maximum in the regime of small matter effect , i.e. , at relatively short baselines of several hundred km .",
    "in such a case there is very poor sensitivity to the neutrino mass hierarchy , if only data from neutrinos and anti - neutrinos are available in a fixed oscillation channel .",
    "the reason is that the leading order correction in the small matter effect parameter @xmath32 can not break the sgn(@xmath7)-degeneracy .",
    "the usual strategy to resolve the degeneracy is to enter the regime of strong matter effect ( by going to longer baselines and higher neutrino energies ) , where the non - linear dependence of @xmath32 becomes important .",
    "here we have proposed an alternative method , namely the combination of all four cp and t - conjugated oscillation channels .",
    "we have shown that the location of the sign - degenerate solution in the plane of @xmath13 and @xmath14  moves in opposite directions for the @xmath16 and @xmath17 channels when the matter effect increases .",
    "this synergy allows to resolve the degeneracy even for matter effects as small as a few percent .",
    "we have discussed the method at the level of oscillation probabilities , and illustrated the effect also by simulations of representative experimental configurations .",
    "a typical situation where our method applies is the combination of beta beam ( @xmath21 ) and super beam ( @xmath18 ) experiments .",
    "we have demonstrated that a significant synergy exists for the determination of the mass hierarchy by simulations of the spl , t2hk , and no@xmath19a super beams combined with a @xmath81 beta beam .",
    "most remarkable , even for the spl / beta beam combination , where both experiments have a baseline of only 130  km , there is sensitivity to the mass hierarchy for @xmath103 due to the synergy of the t - conjugated channels .",
    "another possibility to take advantage of this effect could be a low energy neutrino factory  @xcite operating in an @xmath92 regime where the matter effect is not yet fully developed .",
    "the liquid argon technology , which has been considered for the detector in that reference , has excellent sensitivity for muon as well as electron detection . if in both cases the charge can be identified all four oscillation channels @xmath16 and @xmath17 were available at the neutrino factory . if charge identification is not possible for electrons one could combine the neutrino factory with a super beam experiment providing the @xmath18 information .",
    "the purpose of this note is to point out the existence of a synergy of t - conjugated channels , which can significantly increase the sensitivity to the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "whether this method for the mass hierarchy determination is indeed useful for a given experimental configuration , or is competitive with alternative approaches needs to be confirmed by detailed simulations and comparison studies , which is beyond the scope of this work .",

    "<S> we point out a synergy between t - conjugated oscillation channels in the determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy with oscillation experiments with relatively short baselines ( @xmath0  km ) , where the matter effect is small . </S>",
    "<S> if information from all four oscillation channels @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 is available , a matter effect of few percent suffices to break the sign - degeneracy and allows to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy . </S>",
    "<S> the effect is discussed by analytical considerations of the relevant oscillation probabilities , and illustrated with numerical simulations of realistic experimental setups . </S>",
    "<S> possible configurations where this method could be applied are the combination of a super beam experiment with a beta beam or a neutrino factory , or a ( low energy ) neutrino factory using a detector with muon and electron charge identification .    </S>",
