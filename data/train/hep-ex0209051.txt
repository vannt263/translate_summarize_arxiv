    "one of the primary goals of the phenix experiment at bnl rhic is the measurement of hadron spectra out to large transverse momentum ( @xmath4 ) in high - energy heavy - ion ( hi ) collisions .",
    "particles result from the fragmentation of quarks and gluons produced in large @xmath7 parton - parton scattering processes during the earliest stages of a hi collision and provide direct signatures of the partonic phase of the reaction .",
    "interestingly , hard scattering multiplicities can be quantitatively compared ( after scaling with the number of binary nucleon - nucleon , @xmath8 , inelastic collisions @xmath9 ) to : ( i ) baseline `` vacuum '' ( @xmath3 ) and `` cold medium '' ( @xmath10 ) data , and ( ii ) perturbative qcd predictions . in both cases , any departure ( deficit or excess ) from the `` expected '' results provides information on the strongly interacting hot and dense medium created in the reaction .",
    "one of the most intriguing results from the first rhic run was the suppressed yield of moderately high-@xmath4 @xmath2 ( @xmath11 1.5 - 4.0 gev / c ) in central au+au collisions at @xmath1 = 130 gev with respect to the scaled @xmath3 extrapolation @xcite .",
    "such a suppression is in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions of parton energy loss effects ( `` jet quenching '' ) in an opaque medium , the amount of energy loss being proportional to the reached gluon density @xcite .",
    "during the 2001 - 2002 rhic run , the full phenix electromagnetic calorimeter emcal was instrumented providing a solid angle coverage of approximately @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the integrated luminosity of @xmath1 = 200 gev au+au collisions was about 25 @xmath14b@xmath15 and the collected neutral pion statistics was a factor of @xmath16 larger than in run-1 , allowing the exploration of the @xmath2 spectra up to much larger values in @xmath4 and for finer centrality classes .",
    "phenix also measured the @xmath2 spectrum in @xmath3 collisions at the same @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the combination of full acceptance , high statistics , and the measurement of @xmath3 data in the same detector permits a very precise study of the high-@xmath4 @xmath2 suppression at 200 gev .",
    "the data presented in this analysis correspond to pions from 30@xmath18 @xmath19 `` minimum bias '' events with vertex position @xmath20 30 cm .",
    "the phenix emcal consists of 4 lead - scintillator ( pbsc ) sectors ( 2592 towers per sector with 5.25@xmath215.25@xmath2137.0 @xmath22 size ) in the west central arm plus 2 more sectors in the east one , and 2 lead - glass ( pbgl ) sectors ( 4608 towers of 4.0@xmath214.0@xmath2140.0 @xmath22 ) in the east arm .",
    "the large radial distance of the calorimeter to the interaction region , of @xmath55 m , keeps the detector occupancy reasonably low ( @xmath2315% ) even in the highest multiplicity events of hi collisions at rhic .",
    "event centrality is determined by correlating the charge and energy measured in two global detector systems : the beam - beam counters and the zero degree calorimeters .",
    "neutral pions are reconstructed through an invariant mass analysis of @xmath24 pairs detected in the 8 active emcal sectors .",
    "the raw @xmath2 spectra are then corrected for geometric acceptance and ( multiplicity - dependent ) reconstruction and efficiency losses .",
    "the corrections were determined embedding 2@xmath18 simulated @xmath2 into real events .",
    "the final systematic errors in the fully corrected spectra are of the order of @xmath2525% .",
    "two independent analyses were carried out for the pbsc ( shown here ) and pbgl calorimeters yielding consistent results within the overall systematic error .",
    "figure  [ fig : pi0_spectra ] shows the resulting @xmath2 @xmath4 distributions measured for 70 - 80% peripheral ( _ left _ ) and for 0 - 10% central ( _ right _ ) @xmath19 collisions , compared to the @xmath2 yield measured in @xmath3     yields measured in peripheral ( _ left _ ) and in central ( _ right _ ) @xmath19 collisions ( _ circles _ ) , compared to the @xmath9 scaled @xmath3 @xmath2 yields ( _ stars _ ) @xcite .",

    "collisions @xcite scaled by the corresponding number of binary collisions given by a glauber model calculation : @xmath26 = 12.3 @xmath25 4.0 , and @xmath27 = 975 @xmath25 94 respectively . whereas @xmath2 production in peripheral reactions is consistent with the point - like scaling expectation , the spectrum from the most central reactions is clearly suppressed ( by a factor @xmath52.5 at @xmath28 2 gev / c increasing up to a factor @xmath56 at @xmath28 8 gev / c ) .",
    "a complementary way to depict such a suppression is using the _ nuclear modification factor _",
    "@xmath29    which quantifies the deviation of the @xmath2 yield in @xmath30 collisions with respect to the @xmath3 behaviour ( i.e. with respect to the absence of nuclear - medium effects ) in terms of suppression or enhancement ( @xmath31 smaller or larger than unity , respectively ) .",

    "three interesting conclusions can be extracted from this plot above 2 gev / c , @xmath31 is below unity in all cases since the bulk of particle production is due to soft processes which scale with the number of participant nucleons ( @xmath32 ) rather than with @xmath9 . ]",
    "@xmath4 = 2 gev / c : +    1 .",
    "the @xmath31 values at 200 gev and 130 gev are compatible ( within their corresponding systematic errors ) and clearly below unity : @xmath31(2 gev / c ) @xmath5 0.4 gradually decreasing down to @xmath31(8 gev / c ) @xmath5 0.16 for the highest @xmath17 .",
    "the low @xmath31 values measured at rhic are clearly at variance with the high-@xmath4 hadron production enhancement ( @xmath331 ) observed at cern - sps energies ( wa98 data ) @xcite : no `` cronin effect '' @xcite is observed .",
    "3 .   the trend of @xmath31 below unity in the range @xmath34 gev / c ( corresponding to parton fractional momenta @xmath35 ) seems to be inconsistent with initial - state nuclear effects ( `` shadowing '' of the @xmath36 parton distribution function ) .",
    "indeed , shadowing is known @xcite to decrease for larger @xmath37 ( turning into `` anti - shadowing '' above @xmath38 0.1 ) , whereas @xmath31 consistenly diminishes for larger @xmath4 values",
    ". +    the same quenching is evident in the nuclear modification factor constructed not from the ratio of @xmath19 to @xmath3 pions but from the ratio of central to peripheral @xmath19 @xmath2 spectra ( scaled by their corresponding centrality - dependent @xmath9 ) .",
    "such @xmath31 ( see fig . 5 of s. mioduszewski contribution @xcite ) , -which have part of the systematic errors on the spectra cancelled out- , are also well below one in central collisions . finally , fig .",
    "[ fig : r_aa]_b _ shows the evolution of the @xmath2 suppression at three fixed @xmath4 bins ( @xmath4= 2.2 , 4.2 and 6.2 gev / c ) as a function of the reaction centrality .",
    "the transition from the binary - scaling behaviour apparent in the peripheral region ( @xmath39 1 , centrality class @xmath40 70% ) to the highly suppressed central region is gradual and seems to occur over the 50 - 70% centrality bin ( the systematic uncertainty in @xmath31 , not shown in this plot , is of the order of @xmath520% ) .     emitted in top 10% central @xmath19 collisions at 200 gev ( _ circles _ ) , and 130 gev ( _ stars _ ) ( the bands show the syst .",

    "the spectral shape and invariant yield of peripheral reactions are consistent with that of @xmath3 collisions scaled by the number of inelastic @xmath8 collisions .",
