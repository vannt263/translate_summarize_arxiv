    "hard x - ray ( hxr ) emissions are widely used to understand the distribution and acceleration of electrons in solar flares .",
    "for this reason , it is vitally important to understand correctly the radiative processes that contribute to the hxr bursts observed from flare electrons .",
    "@xcite ( b08 ) , @xcite derived an equation for the emission of photons by two - body radiative recombination of non - thermal electrons onto hot ions in the thick - target approximation , which was updated in @xcite ( b10 ) to correct errors in the summation over ion types and in the atomic / ionic / radiative coefficients appropriate to the hydrogen ion species considered ( equation 3 of b10 ) .    by careful re - analysis of this work we found that their thick - target recombination expression gives imaginary , and thus unphysical , values for cut - off energies @xmath1 ( with @xmath2 the ionization energy of a bound state with effective charge @xmath3 and recombination end level quantum number @xmath4 , in their notation ) , in the intermediate range of this equation , @xmath5 ( for photon energy @xmath6 ) .",
    "this algebraic error in b08 , carried forward into b10 , would have been evident had b08 or b10 numerically plotted any case involving @xmath1 .",
    "we therefore re - derive this equation in section [ sec : equations ] to correct the functional form , in addition to the corrections already made by b10 to b08 .",
    "spectra calculated with the amended equations are examined in section [ sec : results ] , to show that quite major corrections ( reductions ) in the predicted ntr occur for small cut - offs and large spectral indices , while for some other regimes ntr can be important .",
    "we also discuss the errors that arise during spectral inversion when ntr is neglected in spectral fits , and important implications of ntr in section [ sec : interpretations ] .",
    "we first consider recombination for one bound state of one ion , and then sum over ions @xmath2 and levels @xmath4 to obtain an expression for the total emission .",
    "let the following constants all be written together as @xmath7 , and then the cross - sectional area ( @xmath8 ) for recombination in the kramers approximation @xcite is given by @xmath9 where @xmath6 is the energy of the emitted photon and @xmath10 the kinetic energy of the recombining electron .",
    "we adopt the kramers cross - section for simplicity of comparing ntr with ntb ( and by analogy with b08 ) , although it is inappropriate for general use , when the bethe - heitler cross - section should be used @xcite . by equation 7 of b08 ,",
    "the differential cross - section per unit @xmath6 is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the dirac delta function and @xmath13 is the energy of the bound state of an ion with effective charge @xmath3 and quantum number @xmath4 .",
    "we then evaluate the photon yield @xmath14 per unit @xmath6 for one electron of injection energy @xmath15 during its collisional lifetime using equation b.7 of b08 @xmath16 where @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 , @xmath19 being the coulomb logarithm .",
    "note that the correct limits are in terms of @xmath20 , not @xmath21 ( cf .",
    "b08 , b10 ) .",
    "we adopt a thick - target electron injection spectrum ( electrons sec@xmath22 per unit @xmath15 ) of the same form as equation b.10 of b08 , @xmath23^{-\\delta } & \\text { if } e_{0 } \\geq e_{0c } \\\\      0 & \\text { if } e_{0 } < e_{0c }      \\end{cases }       \\label{electrondist}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the spectral index , @xmath25 is the electron rate above the cut - off ( electrons sec@xmath22 ) , and @xmath26 is the low - energy cut - off .",
    "we combine equations [ eta ] and [ electrondist ] with equation b.6 of b08 to determine the recombination spectrum @xmath27 due to a given bound state of an ion .",
    "however , the limits must be carefully accounted for .",
    "we have two cases : @xmath28 , in which case @xmath29 , and @xmath30 which must be split into three subcases : * 1 . *",
    "@xmath31 , * 2 . * @xmath32 , and * 3 . * @xmath33 .    in the first case , @xmath31 ,",
    "we have @xmath34^{-\\delta } de_{0 } \\nonumber \\\\      & = \\frac{\\gamma_{z\\text{eff},n } \\mathfrak{f}_{0c } } { k \\epsilon } \\big[\\frac{\\epsilon - v_{z_{\\text{eff}}}/n^{2}}{e_{0c}}\\big]^{1-\\delta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the second case , @xmath32 , we similarly find @xmath35    in the third case , @xmath33 , there is no radiation since any photon emitted by recombination must have energy equal to @xmath36 for a given electron kinetic energy @xmath10 , so @xmath37 .    therefore , the combined expression is given by : @xmath38^{1-\\delta } & \\text{if } \\epsilon \\geq e_{0c } + \\frac{v_{z_{\\text{eff}}}}{n^{2 } } \\\\      1 & \\text{if } \\frac{v_{z_{\\text{eff}}}}{n^{2 } }",

    ", we have to sum over each ion and bound state .",
    "the full spectrum is then given by ( compare with equation 3 of b10 ) : @xmath40^{1-\\delta } & \\text{if } \\epsilon \\geq e_{0c } + \\frac{v_{z_{\\text{eff}}}}{n^{2 } } \\\\      1 & \\text{if } \\frac{v_{z_{\\text{eff}}}}{n^{2 } }",

    "the emission predicted by b10 is over - estimated by a constant factor of @xmath45^{1-\\delta}$ ] . for large cut - off energies and small spectral indices ,",
    "this is relatively unimportant . for large spectral indices",
    ", this term grows without bound and can lead to significant errors . for small cut - off energies",
    "the discrepancy can be greater than 90% , and the old expression gives complex , and thus unphysical , values for @xmath46 . in section [ sec : results ] we briefly examine the effect this has on spectra .",
    "using the ( coronal ) abundances and effective charges given in b08 , along with ionization equilibria calculated with chianti v.8 @xcite , we calculate example spectra to examine the amended equations .",
    "figure [ comparison ] shows a comparison between the expressions of b10 and the amended ones here .",
    "the top plots show the recombination spectra for cut - offs of 3 and 10kev , respectively , at a temperature of 20mk , spectral index of 5.5 , and an electron rate above the cut - off @xmath47electrons sec@xmath22 ( along with the ntb spectrum ) .",
    "the bottom plots show the ratio of non - thermal recombination to non - thermal bremsstrahlung , calculated with equation b.11 of b08 .",
    "the correction is most significant in the range @xmath48kev@xmath49kev ( 1.95kev is @xmath50 for fe xxv ) .",
    "we have neglected fe xxvi and xxvii , which should not be abundant at this temperature , so that above that range , the expressions are equivalent .",
    "below @xmath48kev , the correction becomes progressively smaller as photon energy decreases .",
    "comparing the two plots , it is clear that this correction is significant at low cut - offs , accounting for a factor of 100 error with a cut - off of 3 kev and only a factor of 2 with a cut - off of 10 kev .",
    "figure [ othercases ] shows two more examples , with a cut - off of 3kev once again .",
    "the plot at left shows the recombination / bremsstrahlung ratio with a plasma temperature of 10mk ( spectral index and electron flux the same as before ) , while the one at right shows the ratio for a spectral index of 7 ( temperature 20mk ) .",
    "it is immediately clear that the correction is more important at higher temperatures , where the hotter iron ions contribute more to the ntr spectrum . on the other hand , for large spectral indices , the bremsstrahlung emissions diminish rapidly relative to recombination as photon energy decreases , so that recombination becomes increasingly dominant , and can be comparable to or greater than non - thermal bremsstrahlung .    we have tabulated the peak of the ratio as a function of the spectral index and cut - off energy at 20 mk ( table [ ratiotable ] ) .",
    "we list the photon energy at which the ratio peaks ( usually @xmath51kev ) and the peak of the ratio itself . at small cut - offs , it is clear that ntr is an important consideration regardless of the spectral index .",
    "similarly , at large spectral indices , it is clear that the process is important for all cut - offs .",
    "an empirical fit shows that the peak ntr contribution comprises more than half of the hxr signal if @xmath0 , or greater than 10% if @xmath52 .",

    "we bin the energy using the commonly adopted rhessi binning code 22 , extended down to 1kev ( _ i.e. _ 1/3 kev bins up to 15 kev , 1 kev bins up to 100 kev ) .",
    "we then fit these photon spectra from 1 - 10kev with the idl least squares fitting routine mpfit @xcite , assuming only contributions from ntb . in this way",
    ", we gain a sense of the importance of ignoring ntr in spectral fits .",
    "although thermal emissions generally dominate flare spectra at these energies , we are primarily concerned with the relative importance of ntr compared with ntb .",
    "it is important to note that thermal emissions are weak early in the impulsive phase in some small events due to a small emission measure ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , and that they are weak in so - called cold flares ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , so that there are times when thermal emissions are relatively less important compared to non - thermal processes .",
    "further , while the global emission measure may be large , that does not preclude the possibility of emission from part of the volume being dominated by non - thermal emissions .",
    "figure [ fits ] shows the photon spectra and their fits ( top ) , the normalized residuals in the two cases , defined as the total emission minus the fit , then divided by the total emission ( center ) , along with the derived electron distributions obtained from the fits , as compared to the true one used to synthesize the photon spectra ( bottom ) .",

    "there are several major implications of these results .    1",
    ".   * spectra of microflares and small flares * in small events , electron acceleration is rather inefficient with small @xmath26 and/or large @xmath24 ( _ e.g. _ figures 17 and 19 of @xcite ) , with median values of @xmath67kev and @xmath68 @xcite . under such conditions , depending on temperature , ntr can be a significant contributor to the x - ray spectrum at small photon energies , dominating the ntb contribution for large enough @xmath24 .",
    "in such events therefore , ntr can not be neglected in the fitting of low energy photon spectra ( few to 10 kev or so ) . in these low energy bands ,",
    "the fitting and interpretation of spectra are further complicated by the contributions not only of continuum bremsstrahlung and recombination from the thermal electrons but also of spectral lines from high @xmath69 ions . in large flares , with small @xmath24 and electrons accelerated to tremendous energies , bremsstrahlung is the dominant component of emission and ntr a relatively small consideration in fitting spectra .",
    "* inversion of hard x - ray data . * in larger flares",
    ", photon count statistics may be good enough to enable inversion of bremsstrahlung continuum to derive electron spectra @xcite .",
    "if this is undertaken ignoring the small ntr contribution , the resulting errors in the electron spectrum can be large , especially when applied in the few to deka - kev range where the ntr contribution has discontinuous recombination spectral edges - cf .",
    "b08 section 5 .",
    "this issue is even more critical in the thick - target case addressed here where inference of @xmath70 from @xmath71 involves not just the first but also the second derivative of @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "* correction of hard x - ray spectral fitting algorithms .",
    "* existing hard x - ray spectral fitting algorithms ( e.g. rhessi ) incorporating the b08 and corrigendum b10 for ntr contributions should be further amended with our results above .",
    "these amendments mostly reduce the importance of the ntr contribution compared with ntb but the ratio is extremely sensitive to model parameters and can be of order unity in some cases .",
    "we urge authors to use the scaling law in section [ sec : results ] to estimate the relative contribution of ntr to the non - thermal spectrum .",
    "as explained in section 5 of b08 , recombination edges cause jumps in the derivative of the photon spectrum , which in turn cause errors in the inversion of the non - thermal electron distribution , even when the contribution of ntr to the total spectrum is relatively small .",
    "consequently , we re - emphasize the conclusion of b08 that it is important to include ntr in spectral data fitting and interpretations .",
    "there are a few facets of the non - thermal spectrum that remain to be considered .",
    "importantly , we have not treated the non - thermal excitation of bound - bound transitions , or the downward cascade of electrons after recombining into a level with @xmath72",
    ". we will evaluate the relative importance of these mechanisms in future work , in order to fully understand the non - thermal spectrum in flares .",
