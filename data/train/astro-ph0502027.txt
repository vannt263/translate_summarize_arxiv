    "over the last decade or so , evidence has been mounting for the existence of a class of neutron stars called the _ magnetars _ ( thompson & duncan , 1996 ) .",
    "they have enormous external magnetic fields of order @xmath2 g ( and even larger internal field ) , the decay of which powers luminous high energy radiation .",
    "examples of this type of astrophysical source are the soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) , which give sporadic bursts of hard x - ray / soft gamma rays as well as rare , very luminous ( @xmath3erg ) `` giant flares '' ; and the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) , so called because their luminosity far exceeds the spin - down value , and no binary companion is seen .",
    "this implies that the source of power can not be rotational energy and that accretion is excluded .",
    "both the sgrs and axps have spin periods of order @xmath4s and derivatives @xmath5 , and are inferred to be young from their energetics and spin - down , and from supernova remnant associations in some cases .",
    "the two groups have been linked by the discovery of persistent emission from sgrs that is similar to the axps and bursting behaviour in the axps .",
    "see woods & thompson ( 2004 ) for a review .",
    "it is with the discovery of optical and infrared counterparts ( hulleman et al . , 2000 ) that models for axps other than the magnetar became untenable .",
    "hulleman et al .",
    "( 2004 ) were the first to produce a spectral energy distribution for the axp 4u  0142 + 61 , showing an intriguing hint of a spectral feature : a sharp break in the optical .",
    "furthermore , kern & martin ( 2002 ) discovered , optical pulsations with pulsed fraction of the order 25% , modulated at the x - ray period .",
    "although in the magnetar model all the details are not yet ironed out , it does explain how such emission can arise from cyclotron emission by ions in the outer magnetosphere ( thompson , 2004 , priv .",
    "comm . ; thompson , lyutikov & kulkarni , 2002 ) . from the magnetar theory , it is not entirely clear whether one would expect the x - ray and infrared fluxes to be correlated . such a relationship has been seen for the axp 1e  2259 + 586 , which has recently been shown to have correlated x - ray and infrared fluxes following an x - ray bursting episode ( tam et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "the return to the quiescent flux was found to occur on the same time - scales in both bands , and the flux ratio to remain roughly constant throughout the active episode .",
    "1e  1048.1@xmath05937 , is a 6.4s axp in the field of the carina nebula , one of the two axps to have shown sgr - like outbursts to date and also the most noisy in terms of its timing characteristics ( kaspi et al . , 2001 ;",
    "gavriil , kaspi & woods , 2002 ) .",
    "this , as well as its relatively hard spectrum , make it the most sgr - like of the axps ( woods & thompson , 2004 ) . a possible infrared counterpart to 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 was observed by wang & chakrabarty ( 2002 ; henceforth wc02 ) , who found the magnitudes : @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "intriguingly , the source was not detected by israel et al .",
    "( 2002 ) down to limits of @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "ergo the object is highly variable , and therefore of particular interest .",
    "here we present further deep photometry in both the optical and the infrared , showing detections in three bands at levels far fainter than those of wc02 , but consistent with israel et al.s limits .",
    "it may be that wc02 observed the object in a state similar to 1e  2259 + 586 in which its infrared flux was enhanced because of a preceding outburst .",
    "if so , this work probably shows the spectral energy distribution of the object in its quiescent phase .",
    "below , we will first present imaging observations performed at the vlt and magellan , and describe their analyses .",
    "next , we describe the implications of these in three main areas : the variability , spectral energy distribution , and x - ray to infrared flux ratio .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion .",

    "this in turn has a systematic uncertainty of @xmath26 ( monet et al .",

    "infrared images of the field of 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 were taken with isaac ( infrared spectrometer and array camera ; moorwood , 1998 ) on antu , unit telescope 1 of the very large telescope .",

    "the source was detected in the long j- and k@xmath1- , but not in the shorter h - band observations .",
    "standard reduction was carried out in order to subtract the dark current , flat field ( using median averages derived from the science frames ) and combine the frames using iraf .",
    "photometry was performed using daophot  ii ( stetson , 1987 ) .",
    "in order to calibrate the frames , aperture photometry was performed on short - exposure images of three standard stars obtained on the same night .",
    "the aperture size was set large enough to include the majority of the flux from the star , as the sky noise was negligible in comparison ; this established the magnitude zero point for each of the frames .",
    "the airmass of these exposures was in every case within 0.1 of the science exposures , so an atmospheric extinction correction was not necessary .",
    "colour terms were negligible . in order to find the magnitude of the stars in the science field",
    ", the aperture correction was calculated using the difference between the magnitudes produced by the allstar task and those derived using the same large aperture used for the standards for several bright , relatively isolated stars in the frame ( after the removal of fainter neighbours ) .",
    "see table [ phot ] for a list of the magnitudes of field stars around the axp , with the numbering scheme as in wc02 .",
    "the errors on measurements , and also the limiting magnitudes where the source was not detected , were determined empirically .",
    "a routine was run which inserted stars of known magnitude ( scaled from the psf ) into areas of the image free of stars , and then the new image was passed through the same analysis procedure as for the science frame and the standard deviation of the measured magnitudes was calculated for the inserted stars .",
    "the latter is used as the measurement error for that known magnitude .",
    "it incorporates the fact that fainter stars will be spread over a wider magnitude range as measured , and that near the magnitude limit the faintest stars will not be measured at all .",
    "the method gets around any assumptions of the flat field accuracy or profile errors , which are assumed constant parameters in the error model used by daophot .",
    "whilst such parameters could be fitted for each image in turn , and then used to determine the errors , we found that in every case the function of error versus magnitude found by daophot deviated both from our standard deviations and from photon noise whatever the choice of flat - field and profile error .",
    "this turned out to be significant at the very bright end and near the magnitude limit .",
    "we find , in the manner described above , the following magnitudes for the star x1 , the axp counterpart : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",

    "two separate imaging runs were performed in the k@xmath1-band through the night , resulting in two images for analysis .",

    "this noise was not reproducible , and its effect can be seen in our final processed images in figure [ stars ] as a band - like variation in the brightness of the sky .",
    "the images were processed and analysed as above , unsing three standard stars .",

    "a set of images were also taken using the custom ` vr ' filter installed on magic ( a wide , roughly rectangular pass band covering much of v and r ; see jewitt , luu & chen , 1996 ) .",
    "for the i band , about 90% of the integration time was at excellent seeing conditions of @xmath39 , whereas the average seeing was @xmath40 in vr and @xmath41 in z@xmath12 ; see table [ obslog ] .",
    "the i - band images with the brightest sky and worst seeing were excluded from the stacking process , leaving a total of integration time of 7200s .",
    "again , the frames were processed and combined using iraf - daophot ii , with bias subtraction and trimming performed by the ccdmagic task provided by the observatory and flat fields again derived from the science frames ( this proved more successful than screen flats ) .",
    "magnitudes were calibrated using several standard stars and errors calibrated empirically as before ( following the isaac experience above ) .",
    "seven photometric standard stars for this run were taken from the e5 field ( stetson , 2000 ) , at an airmass close to the mean airmass of the science exposure .",
    "the i - band zero point was a simple average over the values inferred from the well exposed stars on the frame .",
    "the source was not detected in the vr - band . for calibration of this non - standard filter",
    ", the e5 standard field was also imaged with the vr filter , and also the standard v and r filters to check for consistency .",
    "the vr zero point and effective wavelength were deduced in the following manner : the standard stars were assumed to have power - law spectra over their v ",
    "r range , so that the vr magnitude would be a simple interpolation , @xmath42 , where the parameter @xmath43 is to be found .",
    "next , vr was defined to be such that the colour - term coefficient is zero : @xmath44 ( where @xmath45 is the instrumental magnitude and @xmath46 the zero point ) . in effect , this makes this particular vr filter the prototype for this magnitude scale .",

    "the z@xmath12 band is on the magnitude ab system , and is based on a different set of standard stars for its basic calibration . in order to find the zero point , well - known empirical transformations between z@xmath12 and the vri bands were used ( smith et al . , 2001 ) to find the magnitudes of each of the standard stars .",

    "this is illustrated in figure [ sed ] .",
    "1e  1048.1@xmath05937 is currently part of a regular monitoring programme using the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) , and has been observed many times over the last two years , at particularly closely spaced intervals during the time of the observations above ( gavriil & kaspi , 2004 ) .",
    "marked changes are seen during this period in pulsed flux and spin - down rate ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the hardness ratio shows no clear variations during this time .",
    "figure [ vary ] shows the pulsed flux and spin - down rate , with k - band photometry points as a comparison .",
    "one sees a hint of anti - correlation between the x - ray and infrared fluxes , and no obvious relationship between the infrared flux and spin - down rate .",
    "as gavriil & kaspi ( 2004 ) stated , x - ray flux and spin - down rate are clearly not related .    for another source also in the rxte monitoring programme , 1e  2259 + 586",
    ", recent results indicate that x - ray and infrared fluxes _ were _ correlated in the period following multiple x - ray bursts and increased activity ( tam et al . , 2004 ) with both spectral bands showing",
    "increased persistent fluxes , which decayed towards the pre - burst values on the same time - scale .",
    "this suggests that the mechanism at work in 1e  2259 + 586 is different from that of 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 , possibly because of the bursting activity ( note that bursting activity can not be excluded by the rxte observations of 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 ) .",
    "the intrinsic spectrum that we derive for the axps depends strongly on the value that we assume for the interstellar reddening along the line of sight .",
    "since the reddening to all of the magnetars in the plane of the galaxy have nominal reddening @xmath60 ( which includes all of the axps , apart from the recently discovered cxou  j010043.1 - 721134 , majid et al . , 2004 )",
    ", the extinction correction is huge and has a profound impact on the spectrum derived . as an example , the inferred optical spectrum of 4u  0142 + 61 changes from raleigh - jeans like to flat ( in @xmath61 ) for a change @xmath62 to @xmath63 ( hulleman et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "it is therefore important to consider this as part of the analysis .",
    "usually , the model for the intrinsic x - ray spectrum is used to infer the amount of extincting material ( given as the hydrogen column , @xmath64 ) , and assuming the relationship derived by predehl & schmitt ( 1995 ) to calculate the reddening due to dust .    for 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 , tiengo et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found an apparently featureless x - ray spectrum well - fitted by an absorbed power law ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) plus blackbody ( @xmath67 kev ) .",
    "this model for the x - ray spectrum yields an extremely high value for the extincting column to the source of @xmath68 @xmath52 , comparable to values of total extinction seen through many lines of sight through the galactic plane ( but see also below ) . in this way",
    ", values typically of order @xmath69 have been arrived at ( wc02 ) for 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 . comparing this estimate to the typical reddening to stars in the carina nebula ( @xmath70 ) , seward et al .",
    "( 1986 ) argued that the axp must lie behind the carina nebula , and thus placed a lower limit on its distance of @xmath71 kpc .",
    "there exist other independent methods for estimating the run of reddening with distance in any given line of sight . for our field , we found the following relevant measurements .",
    "neckel , klare & sarcander ( 1980 ) measured the average function of reddening with distance , @xmath72 , in many galactic - plane fields including one containing this source .",
    "they find that as a function of distance , the visual extinction is constant between 1.5kpc ",
    "6kpc at @xmath73",
    ". it should be stressed , however , that this value is an average over their field ( size of order @xmath74square degrees ) , and one could argue that measurement biases would favour a lower value of extinction at any given distance in an area of highly variable dust content .",
    "carrero et al .",
    "( 2004 ) performed colour - magnitude studies of three nearby open clusters in the carina complex ( approximately @xmath75 from the region of interest ) .",
    "for the clusters trumpler 16 and trumpler 14 , they find that @xmath762.0(1 ) and 1.8(7 ) and distances of @xmath773.9(5 ) and 2.5(3 ) respectively .",
    "this is in a region where the dust density is visibly greater than the surrounding sky ; for 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 to have a greater extinction , this suggests a more constraining lower bound on its distance .",
    "it should be noted however , that the authors of this study stress the variability of reddening from star to star in the clusters .",
    "finally , merehgetti , caravea & bignami ( 1992 ) find that one of the brighter stars in the field is probably very highly redenned ( @xmath78 ) , based on two interstellar absorption bands ( 4428 and 5778 ) in its spectrum .",
    "the distance to this star is unknown .    to summarise ,",
    "there is reason to question our assumption that the value of @xmath64 gained through the fitting of the x - ray spectrum gives an appropriate value of reddening ; such a suggestion has also arisen in the case of the brightest of the axps , 4u  0142 + 61 .",
    "hulleman , van kerkwijk & kulkarni ( 2004 ) suggest that values in the range @xmath79 are possible .",
    "a similar uncertainty was also suggested in the case of axp 1e  2259 + 586 ( from the measurements of optical filaments in its associated supernova remnant , fesen & hurford , 1995 ) .",
    "as we see below , the value we use to de - redden flux measurements will alter the shape of the resultant spectrum drastically .",
    "figure [ sed2 ] shows the inferred spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , de - redenned using @xmath80 ( the value derived from the x - ray spectral fit ) .",
    "as can be seen , a line of @xmath81 would be consistent with these points ( the h - and vr - band limits are consistent with such a hypothesis ) .    also on figure [ sed2 ]",
    "is plotted the sed of 4u  0142 + 61 ( hulleman , van kerkwijk & kulkarni , 2004 ) , showing the optical and infrared regions for comparison , de - redenned with the nominal value for that source of @xmath82 .",
    "the inferred seds of the two axps are clearly inconsistent ( see particularly the i - band point ) .",
    "it is worth noting here , following from section [ red ] , that the reddening to both these objects is rather uncertain . with @xmath80 ,",
    "1e  1048.1@xmath05937 has as sed with @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "this changes to @xmath85 for @xmath86 .",
    "hulleman , van kerkwijk & kulkarni ( 2004 ) suggest that for 4u  0142 + 61 , values of reddening as low as @xmath87 are possible , based on the run of reddening with distance along the line of sight .",
    "were one to take @xmath87 for 4u  0142 + 61 , its sed would look much flatter and not unlike that which is shown for 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 with @xmath80 .",
    "thus it could indeed be that the two have similar intrinsic spectra but that the value assumed for reddening is wrong for either or both of the sources .    if we were to assume that the intrinsic spectra of the two axps 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 and 4u  0142 + 61 are the same",
    ", then this allows us to calculate the relative reddening between the two objects , @xmath88 .",
    "this value enables a comparison between the two objects without knowledge of the specific reddening to either one . by comparing the @xmath89 colours of the two objects we find @xmath901.2(5 ) , implying @xmath91 .",
    "thus , if the intrinsic spectra are indeed the same , 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 would have @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "these predictions can be tested .      in table [ fx - fir ] we list the currently known x - ray to infrared flux ratios of the axps , corrected for extinction using the nominal values of @xmath64 derived from fits to the x - ray spectra .",
    "note that neither the 2  10kev range nor the k - band suffer considerable extinction , so these numbers are not heavily dependent on the values of reddening chosen .",
    "however , some of the sources have shown large variability in both their x - ray and infrared fluxes , and the numbers here represent values only at some particular time .",
    "given the variability , the flux ratios are remarkably consistent , except for that of 1rxs  j170849@xmath0400910 .",
    "interestingly , the counterpart for the latter is the least secure amongst the axps , as its association is based on astrometry and possible peculiar colours only ( israel et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "in fact , its inconsistency with the other sources in this table suggests that perhaps the other , fainter source within the _ chandra _ error circle ( named star ` b ' by these authors ) could be the counterpart .",
    "the relative contributions of the sources to the j - band flux is unknown , and might account for the apparent strange colours of star a.    1e 1048.1@xmath05937 has varied in both its x - ray and infrared emission ( see section [ varysec ] ) by over a factor of 2 , so the range which the flux ratio could take , when measured at some particular epoch is large . from figure [ vary ] , we see that the ratio of pulsed x - ray flux to infrared flux has varied from @xmath94  @xmath95 ( in units of ctspcu@xmath51/erg@xmath52 ) . on the one hand , then , the x - ray to infrared flux ratios of axps are similar , and for 1e  2259 + 586 the x - ray and infrared fluxes were correlated following an outburst . on the other hand , the infrared and x - ray fluxes of 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 seem , if anything , to be anti - correlated .",

    "in this work , we have detected the likely quiescent counterpart to the axp 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 .",
    "to summarise our findings , we have found large ( @xmath742mag ) variations in the infrared brightness of 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 which suggest a possible anti - correlation with x - ray flux , but no clear relationship with spin - down rate .",
    "this variability is the largest that has been seen in the axps , but variability is not unique to this source .",
    "the anti - correlation between infrared and x - ray flux is opposite to the behaviour of 1e  2259 + 586 , where a positive correlation was found ( tam et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "the infrared spectrum has remained of a consistent shape with wc02 .",
    "we find that the inferred spectral energy distribution of 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 is inconsistent with that inferred for 4u  0142 + 61 , but that they can be made consistent with an appropriate choice of relative reddening ( for which there may be justification ) .",
    "we find that although both the infrared and x - ray for this source vary a large amount and are not correlated , that the x - ray to infrared flux ratio is consistent with the other axps .",
    "perhaps this challenges our understanding of whether the axps do indeed have quiescent periods , and of the time - scales on which the magnetosphere reacts to internal magnetic changes .",
    "we now discuss what relationships might be expected from the magnetar model .",
    "the model proposed for how infrared and optical emission might arise from a magnetar is as follows .",
    "the decay of the internal magnetic field of the magnetar induces a twist in the magnetosphere of the magnetar .",
    "this large - scale twist is supported by global , persistent currents , which exist out to large radii .",
    "these currents power the non - thermal x - ray and gamma - ray luminosity , and may also produce infrared and optical emission , through ion cyclotron radiation at large radii ( thompson , lyutikov & kulkarni , 2002 ) .    in the case that the infrared radiation is indeed cyclotron emission by ions gyrating in the outer magnetosphere , the infrared flux and torque should be correlated because of the following argument .",
    "first , the number of ions travelling to large enough radii to have landau transition energies in the optical / infrared range is a fixed fraction of the total electric current .",
    "the total current in the magnetosphere defines the amount of twist in the global magnetic field structure ( that is , the departure from a pure dipolar field ) , which in turn affects the rate at which the field strength falls off with radius .",
    "since the torque is caused by the field strength at the light cylinder , it must then be correlated to the ion population at large radii and so to the infrared flux ( thompson , lyutikov & kulkarni , 2002 ) .    whether the infrared and x - ray flux are expected to be correlated",
    "depends on the details of their respective emission mechanisms .",
    "changes in x - ray flux would be possible , for example , from internal heating , which would not directly affect the infrared emission .    in order to constrain the emission mechanism for the infrared flux",
    ", it will be important to establish whether the anti - correlation between infrared and x - ray flux is indeed real , and whether the ir flux to torque correlation can really be ruled out .",
    "it would also be interesting to look for a correlation with the flux in the strong , hard x - ray tail of the spectrum that was recently discovered by kuiper at al .",
    "furthermore , it would be worthwhile to seek further spectral signatures , and to find or at least constrain the reddening and distance to the various sources .",
