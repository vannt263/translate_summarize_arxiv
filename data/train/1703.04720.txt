    "+ an ideal clock with a fractional frequency stability of @xmath80 is expected to reach the 10@xmath28 level after about 400 s integration time . in the cw regime , from data given just above , this requires to demonstrate that laser power fluctuations @xmath81 at 400 s averaging time are lower than 1.25 nw , i.e. @xmath82 . in the pulsed case , this laser power control level",
    "would be reduced such that @xmath83 , which seems easier to achieve .",
    "+ in that sense , the pulsed interaction is expected to be the best solution for the demonstration of a clock with improved mid - term and long - term frequency stability .",
    "note that the pulsed interaction involves a bit more complex digital electronics design for proper operation of all required servo loops of the clock and the addition of a fast optical switch to generate the light pulsed sequence .",
    "however , these functions remain accessible without any significant increase of the consumption and cost of the device .",
    "detailed investigations will be pursued in the future in the laboratory to improve the mid - term and long - term frequency stability performances of the present clock .",
    "we have demonstrated a pulsed cpt - based cs vapor cell atomic clock exhibiting a short - term fractional frequency stability of 2.3 @xmath27 10@xmath84 up to 100 seconds averaging time .",
    "these performances are comparable to those of best vapor cell microwave frequency standards developed worldwide .",
    "the clock short - term frequency stability was optimized through the adjustment of key experimental parameters including the cell temperature , the laser power and the ramsey - cpt sequence parameters .",
    "a dependence on laser power of the central fringe in the pulsed regime was reported .",
    "the central fringe line - width was measured commonly narrower than the expected ramsey line - width @xmath0 for short free - evolution times .",
    "similar frequency stability performances were obtained in the cw regime , with the use of an additional laser power stabilization system .",
    "a significant reduction of the clock frequency sensitivity to laser power variations was measured in the pulsed case , especially for high values of the free - evolution time @xmath1 .",
    "we think that the use of a pulsed ramsey - like interrogation , possibly combined with some extensions of hyper - ramsey spectroscopy and original synthetic frequency protocols @xcite applied to cpt , improved laser power stabilization or advanced frequency drift compensation techniques , are exciting and promising methods to improve the long - term frequency stability performances of such cpt - based vapor cell clocks .",
