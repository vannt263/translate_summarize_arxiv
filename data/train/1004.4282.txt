    "one of the most characteristic features of high temperature superconductivity ( sc ) is that upon hole doping , with the hole concentration @xmath5 , a generic antiferromagnetic mott insulating state of e.g. @xmath6 @xcite transforms into sc state .",
    "the latter , in turn , after reaching a maximal transition temperature at @xmath7 , disappears at the upper critical concentration @xmath8 , depending on the system .",
    "@xcite the last property is particularly surprising , since in the overdoped regime @xmath9 the system evolves gradually from a non - fermi liquid into a quantum liquid that can be regarded as an unconventional fermi liquid .",
    "@xcite the appearance of @xmath10 may speak in favor of real - space type of pairing , as the increased hole doping reduces the pairing correlations in real space . to describe the above features",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 model is often invoked , @xcite and the kinetic exchange interaction is claimed to induce both antiferromagnetism and the superconductivity . @xcite",
    "the basic question is whether within the renormalized mean - field theory ( rmft ) @xcite we can reproduce at least some of the above properties in a semiquantitative manner , @xcite as advocated strongly .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , variational monte carlo ( vmc ) methods , within which one treats exactly the double occupancy exclusion , is known @xcite to provide a semiquantitative description of the sc correlated state .",
    "hence it is often regarded as being superior to any mean - field ( mf ) treatment .",
    "however , a proper mf approach would have important advantages over vmc . first , its results are not limited to small clusters .",
    "second , it can offer an analytic insight into the physical contents of the model .",
    "third , it allows for a detailed comparison with experiment or , strictly speaking , its critical assessment , as detailed below .",
    "numerous attempts to improve rmft have been made , @xcite in order to take into account also intersite correlations .",
    "here we show that within the mf renormalization scheme proposed recently by fukushima , @xcite supplemented with the maximum - entropy based @xcite self - consistent variational approach , @xcite we can produce , among others , the results that are competitive to those of vmc .",
    "specifically , the upper critical concentration @xmath10 , as well as the principal features of the excitation spectrum , are shown to agree quite well with experiment in the overdoped regime .",
    "finally , motivated by a recent paper,@xcite we comment on the extension of the present treatment to finite temperatures .",
    "we study a behavior of the renormalized gap magnitude as a function of the temperature , which is shown to be in quite good agreement with the classic result of the bcs theory .",
    "we start from @xmath0-@xmath1 model @xcite is expressed by the following hamiltonian @xmath11 the first term , @xmath12 is the kinetic energy part , the second expresses the kinetic exchange , and the third the three - site terms .",
    "@xmath13 means the summation pair of sites @xmath14 ( bonds ) .",
    "the gutzwiller projector @xmath15 eliminates double occupancies in real space . also , explicitly @xmath16 with the projected fermion operators defined as : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 . here",
    "the standard fermion creation ( annihilation ) operators are @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) and @xmath23 .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ t - j exact complete ] ) in its complete form , i.e. with @xmath24 is derived by applying canonical transformation to the hubbard hamiltonian , @xmath25 , in the strong coupling ( @xmath26 ) limit , @xcite @xmath27 .",
    "then , kinetic exchange integral @xmath28 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath29 case has been used as a simplified effective model describing low - energy sector of a multi - band hubbard model .",
    "@xcite both the latter form , or that with @xmath30 , @xmath31 , are often used in studies of high- @xmath32 superconductivity .",
    "our aim here is , among others , to compare the complete version of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model with the simpler forms .",
    "it has been argued , @xcite that a correct variational state describing the ground state of the @xmath0-@xmath1 hamiltonian is of the form @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is an uncorrelated state , here taken as the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs)-type state .",
    "when the hubbard model is the starting point of analysis , the re - transformed back state with perturbatively reintroduced double occupancies is used instead , i.e @xmath35 .",
    "@xcite also , the detailed form of @xmath36 may be postulated without specifying the underlying microscopic hamiltonian .",
    "@xcite however , within rmft , @xmath36 may also be selected as an eigenstate of the effective single - particle hamiltonian , obtained from the mean - field treatment of ( [ t - j exact complete ] ) .",
    "@xcite this point of view is also taken up here .",
    "construction of rmft requires a prescription ( here called the renormalization scheme , rs ) for calculating expectation value of an arbitrary operator @xmath37 in the correlated state @xmath38 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath39 in the above , the projector @xmath40 has been replaced by more general correlator @xmath41 , which differs from @xmath40 by the presence of fugacity factors , ensuring that the projected and preprojected average particle numbers are equal , i.e. @xmath42 .",
    "@xcite    we adopt the rs of ref . and supplement it with the variational formalism proposed recently by us .",
    "@xcite combination of these two factors yields the results that differ considerably as compared to those of the standard rmft .",
    "@xcite to carry out the self - consistent variational approach , we start from the following effective mf grand hamiltonian @xmath43 with @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "the averages @xmath50 are defined by ( [ rs equation ] ) for zero temperature , or in general , with the help of density operator @xmath51 , ( see below ) .",
    "@xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 ( not to be confused with the fugacity factors of ref . )",
    "are the lagrange multipliers , ensuring the self - consistency of this variational approach , as this is not guaranteed within the standard gutzwiller approximation .",
    "@xcite the form ( [ h no mu mf tj like tilde ] ) , apparently different from the usual formulation of rmft , is fully equivalent to it ( a similar approach is discussed in ref . ) .",
    "we solve this model on a square lattice and in the spatially homogeneous situation , with no coexisting magnetic order .",
    "the model parameters are @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where @xmath57 corresponds to sites located at the distances @xmath58 of @xmath59 , and @xmath60 lattice constants , respectively .",
    "consequently , the following lagrange multipliers and the corresponding mean fields are assumed as nonzero : @xmath61 and @xmath62 ; @xmath63 , with @xmath64 and @xmath65 , both for @xmath66 ; @xmath67 and @xmath68 . also ,",
    "in ( [ t - j exact complete ] ) we retain all the terms of the orders of @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and neglect a smaller term of the order @xmath71 .",
    "then , @xmath72 is obtained using the formalism of ref . .",
    "explicitly , @xmath73 where @xmath74 , and @xmath75 is the number of lattice sites . in effect",
    ", we have that @xmath76    @xmath77    the formula for @xmath78 , containing three - site terms , is too lengthy to be reproduced here .",
    "the next step is the diagonalization of @xmath79 ( [ h no mu mf tj like tilde ] ) via bogoliubov - valatin transformation , which leads to @xmath80 with @xmath81 .",
    "also , the quasiparticle energy @xmath82 , the renormalized gap @xmath83 , and the renormalized band energy @xmath84 are respectively given by @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",
    "then , the corresponding grand - canonical density operator reads @xmath91 with @xmath92 $ ] , @xmath93 , and the generalized landau functional , @xmath94 reads @xmath95 because of extra constraints in ( [ h no mu mf tj like tilde ] ) , the necessary conditions for @xmath96 to have a minimum are @xmath97 for the mean - fields @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and the lagrange multipliers @xmath100 .",
    "in contrast to our previous formulation , @xcite the equations @xmath101 are solved analytically , but the solution of those remaining ( @xmath102 ) must be determined numerically .",
    "optimal values of the mean - fields and the lagrange multipliers , given by a solution of ( [ derivative of mathcalf a , lambda ] ) characterized with the lowest value of @xmath96 and denoted respectively @xmath103 , @xmath104 , may be used next to construct standard grand thermodynamic potential @xmath105 and the free energy @xmath106 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath107 the present formalism , based on the maximum - entropy principle @xcite is formally valid for arbitrary @xmath108 .",
    "consequently , we have replaced pure state @xmath109 by mixed state represented by @xmath110 . however , the solutions obtained for non - zero , but sufficiently low @xmath111 , are for all practical purposes identical to those for @xmath112 .",
    "this situation is studied in the next section .",
    "the separate question is that of the validity of rmft approach at @xmath108 from the point of view of physical consistency .",
    "this is analyzed in more detail in section iv .",
    "an analytical expression for @xmath114 allows us to make qualitative predictions before the numerical analysis is carried out .",
    "first , from ( [ w kin ] ) we expect a strong tendency to the superconductivity suppression for higher doping , as sc order leads to the band energy decrease @xmath115 . on the other hand , in that regime",
    "the renormalized band energy becomes predominant over the exchange part . in effect , the normal state is favored over sc for @xmath116 with @xmath10 smaller than obtained within previous mf treatments .",
    "@xcite second , from ( [ w j ] ) we infer , that the influence of the @xmath117 term on @xmath118 is small except for the largest doping ; this is due to the presence of the @xmath119 prefactor ( the other term @xmath120 merely shifts the chemical potential ) . on the other hand , @xmath121 is multiplied only by @xmath122 prefactor .",
    "consequently , for higher @xmath123 this term becomes rather important , due to the number of distinct three - site terms present for a given initial site and spin direction ( eight for @xmath124 , and four for @xmath125 ) .",
    "also , this part of @xmath126 is expected to suppress sc order , as the term @xmath127 in @xmath121 contains a factor , which is positive for reasonable values of other mean fields and model parameters .",
    "we solve numerically the part @xmath102 of eqs .",
    "( [ derivative of mathcalf a , lambda ] ) for the mean fields using periodic boundary conditions on the lattice of @xmath128 sites , to minimize finite size effects and for low temperature @xmath129 .",
    "the solution amounts to solving simultaneously the system of five nonlinear equations using gnu scientific library ( gsl ) . in the most cases we take the parameters @xmath130 ( corresponding to @xmath131 for the hubbard model ) , @xmath132 or @xmath133 , and @xmath134",

    "@xcite within this approach , termed _ finite temperature rmft _ ( trmft ) , the term @xmath160 is added to the single - particle entropy @xmath161 of the mean - field model ( here , @xmath162 ) . in eq .",

    "note , that @xmath172 .",
    "derivation of ( [ delta entropy of wang ] ) , and its possible generalizations will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "@xcite here we simply adapt eq .",
    "( [ delta entropy of wang ] ) , which may be treated as a reasonable _ ansatz _ , similar in spirit to the finite - temperature extensions of the gutzwiller approximation proposed earlier .",
    "@xcite    within the present formalism , @xmath173 can be included by replacing @xmath174 ( [ w ] ) by @xmath175 .",
    "however , for the @xmath0-@xmath1 model , @xmath176 , and consequently , for non - magnetic , homogeneous solutions studied here , @xmath177 depends only on the total particle number @xmath178 , i.e. @xmath179 therefore , the presence of @xmath180 results only in different values of @xmath181 , @xmath182 , and thermodynamic potentials @xmath105 and @xmath183 ( [ thermo potentials bis ] ) .",
    "still , @xmath184 , all the mean fields , and the remaining lagrange multipliers , as well as the free energy difference between the superconducting and the normal solutions , remain unchanged .",
    "hence , @xmath173 in the form ( [ delta entropy of wang ] ) does not lead to any nontrivial modifications of our original formulation .",
    "nonetheless , it still seems to be interesting to apply the above formalism to examine nonzero temperature situation .",
    "this would reveal limitations of the present form of rmft and should help in formulating more satisfactory finite - temperature mean - field treatment of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    "first , in fig . [ t dependance ren delta ] we plot temperature dependence of ( renormalized ) gap magnitude @xmath185 as a function of @xmath111 for selected hole concentrations .    for the values of model parameters used here , we have @xmath186 ( @xmath187 ) for @xmath188 ( @xmath189 ) , respectively .",
    "therefore , the critical temperature is overestimated by a factor 3 - 5 ( e.g. @xmath190 at the optimal doping and @xmath191 at @xmath192 .",
    "this is a common feature of all mean - field type approaches , clearly caused by neglecting the fluctuations .",
    "this also shows the insufficiency of the expression @xmath173 ( [ delta entropy of wang ] ) in the present @xmath0-@xmath1 model case .    nonetheless , one interesting property of the present approach should be noted .",
    "namely , an uncorrelated wave function @xmath193 , or a related density operator @xmath194 ( [ rho moje ] ) has an essentially the same form as that coming from the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory .",
    "therefore , it seems natural to compare our values of reduced renormalized gap magnitude @xmath195 with the standard bcs result @xcite given by @xmath196 , where @xmath197 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ bcs behavior ] .",
    "interestingly , the agreement with the bcs results is quite good , despite the renormalization of @xmath198 and its nontrivial d - wave symmetry .",
    "uncorrelated ( bare ) gap ratio @xmath199 exhibits very similar scaling with @xmath200 .",
    "in this paper , we aimed to describe the doping dependences of selected , experimentally measured quantities , we have decided to systematize the results coming from different versions of @xmath0-@xmath1 model , that are discussed in the literature . from that analysis",
    "it follows that while the presence of the term @xmath201 does not influence remarkably the results except for the largest doping @xmath123 , the inclusion of the three - site terms ( @xmath202 ) reduces substantially the range in which superconductivity is present .",
    "we have implemented the mean - field renormalization scheme @xcite to @xmath0-@xmath1 model , in which both the kinetic - exchange and the three - site terms can be taken into account .",
    "such rmft approach , which is based on an effective single - particle picture , is expected to be valid first of all in the overdoped regime , where an unconventional form of the fermi liquid is obtained .",
    "the variational approach based on the maximum entropy principle @xcite has been used to determine mean - field parameters appearing in the model .",
    "the theoretical results yield a correct value for the upper critical concentration for the high-@xmath157 d - wave superconductivity disappearance .",
    "our method provides also lower single - particle energies compared to the previous mf results .",
    "@xcite consequently , a good estimate of the experimentally determined gap @xmath152 is detected experimentally in the overdoped regime for typical values of the model parameters .",
    "however , the values of the fermi velocity in the nodal direction are still slightly too low .",
    "we also have examined the temperature dependence of the superconducting gap magnitude and have determined the critical temperature @xmath203 evolution as a function of hole concentration . as may be expected , mean - field results overestimate @xmath157 by a factor 3 - 5 .",
    "the present results can be generalized by taking into account more complex lattice or band structure , the broken @xmath204 symmetry ( pomeranchuk instability @xcite ) , and antiferromagnetism .",
    "furthermore , study of the fermi - surface - topology evolution with the doping is achievable .",
    "finally , a more advanced scheme of calculating the entropy of the correlated state is desired to provide more satisfactory description of the nonzero - temperature situation .",
    "we should be able to see progress along these lines soon .",
