    "central exclusive production ( cep ) processes of the type @xmath2 can significantly extend the physics programme at hadron colliders .",
    "these reactions represent an experimentally very clean signal and provide a very promising way to investigate both qcd dynamics and new physics in hadron collisions .",
    "they have been widely discussed in the literature , and we refer the reader to  @xcite for reviews and further references .",
    "a particularly interesting example , which has been the topic of recent investigations in  @xcite , is the production of light meson pairs ( @xmath3 ... ) at sufficiently high transverse momentum @xmath4 that a perturbative approach can be taken . in section  [ eta ]",
    "we consider the case of @xmath5 production , and show how this can be highly sensitive to the gluonic component of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 mesons .",
    "we recall that currently , while different determinations of the @xmath0@xmath1 mixing parameters are generally consistent , the long  standing issue concerning the extraction of the gluon content of the @xmath1 ( and @xmath0 ) remains uncertain , see  @xcite for more details and references .",
    "more generally , theoretical studies of meson pair cep within a ` non  perturbative ' ( calculated in a regge theory ) framework in fact have a long history , see  @xcite and references therein for more details .",
    "such an approach should be relevant at lower values of the meson transverse momentum @xmath4 , where most of the data is expected to lie .",
    "we present in section  [ dimesec ] the first results from the new ` dime ` monte carlo  @xcite for meson pair cep , modelled within such a regge  based approach .",
    "we consider the case of @xmath6 production and show how it may be used as a probe of the phenomenological production model .",
    "we also demonstrate how , in the presence of tagged protons , such processes may be used as a test of the models of hadronic interactions needed to calculate the soft survival factors .",
    "the @xmath7 helicity amplitudes relevant to the cep of light meson pairs @xmath8 , @xmath9 are calculated using an extension of the ` hard exclusive ' formalism , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that the hadron  level amplitude can be written as a convolution of a perturbatively calculable parton ",
    "level amplitude , @xmath10 , for the @xmath11 process ( where each @xmath12 or @xmath13 pair is collinear with the meson momentum and has the appropriate colour , spin , and flavour content projected out to form the parent meson ) , and a ` distribution amplitude ' @xmath14 , which contains all the non  perturbative information about the binding of the partons in the meson .     for @xmath15 production at @xmath16 tev , taken from  @xcite .",
    "]    as discussed in  @xcite , the flavour  singlet @xmath17 mesons should contain a non ",
    "zero @xmath13 component , which can be accessed via the @xmath18 parton ",
    "level diagrams .",
    "the relevant amplitudes were calculated in  @xcite , giving @xmath19 corresponding to the @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 final states , respectively .",
    "remarkably , it was observed that the amplitudes , despite coming from completely separate classes of feynman diagrams , are identical in form up to overall normalization factors .",
    "one important phenomenological consequence of this is that we expect no dynamical suppression in the @xmath13 final states .",
    "this motivated a detailed a numerical study , performed in  @xcite , in which it was shown that the cep cross sections for @xmath5 states could indeed be highly sensitive to any @xmath13 component .",
    "in particular , guided by the fit of  @xcite , a band of representative values for the size and sign of the @xmath13 wavefunction @xmath23 within the @xmath1 , @xmath0 were taken , and the predicted cep cross sections were shown to vary by up to an order of magnitude , as shown in fig .",
    "[ etamcz ] .",
    "we may therefore hope that future @xmath1 , @xmath0 pair cep data and analysis will be forthcoming from the tevatron and the lhc and that through this we can shed some light on this interesting and currently uncertain question .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the predicted cross sections for meson pair cep are in general much larger in the lower @xmath4 ( @xmath24 ) region , for which the perturbative approach is not necessarily applicable . at this conference the first data on exclusive @xmath6 production from cdf  @xcite and the star collaboration at rhic , with tagged protons  @xcite , have been discussed . in this lower mass region",
    "we can apply a phenomenological model , in which the mesons are produced via double pomeron exchange , and the cross section can be calculated using the tools of regge theory , see  @xcite .",
    "the details of such a model are currently somewhat uncertain ; in particular , prior to the cdf data , the form factor for the coupling of the pomeron to the meson pair production subprocess was relatively unconstrained , in particular as the meson @xmath4 increases .",
    "we have recently implemented such a model in the new ` dime ` mc  @xcite , including different possibilities for this form factor , and in fig .",
    "[ piplots ] ( left ) we show the predicted invariant mass @xmath25 distribution for @xmath6 production at @xmath16 tev for these different choices , defined in  @xcite , which we can compare with the cdf data to shed light on this model .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "[ piplots ] ( right ) the distribution , at @xmath26 tev , in the relative azimuthal angle @xmath27 between the outgoing protons , for different models choices for the soft survival factor , as defined in  @xcite . in this figure ,",
    "a cut of @xmath28 gev has been placed on the transverse momenta of one proton , and in this region we can see an interesting ` diffractive dip ' structure , which is driven purely by the effect of the soft survival factor . indeed , we can see that the precise shape of this is somewhat sensitive to the specific model choice .",
    "thus , the observation of for example @xmath6 cep in the presence of tagged protons would provide novel insight into the models of soft physics used to calculate these survival factors .",
