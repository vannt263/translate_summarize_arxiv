    "paul traps have become essential tools in widely different fields of research ranging from quantum information@xmath0@xcite and quantum simulation@xmath0@xcite to precision metrology@xmath0@xcite and cold collisions between ions and neutrals@xmath0@xcite .",
    "the further development of all these lines of research hinges on continuing improvements of the paul trap architectures and on a better understanding of the current experimental issues .",
    "+ ideally , a single ion in a paul trap is only subjected to the electric fields generated by the voltages applied to the trap electrodes . however , even small spatial variations of the electrode surface potential ( i.e. patch potentials ) in the vicinity of the trap center create stray electric fields which significantly perturb this ideal configuration .",
    "this leads to undesired experimental complications .",
    "quasi - static stray fields lead to positional shifts of the trapped ion@xmath0@xcite and thus to excess micromotion@xmath0@xcite . rapidly fluctuating stray fields",
    "lead to ion heating @xmath0@xcite .    for the following discussion",
    ", we will formally group patch potentials into two categories .",
    "+ patch potentials of category 1 can decay via electronic discharge currents , similar to a capacitor that is shorted with a resistor .",
    "thus , their evolution is in general governed by the motion of electrons .",
    "for example , the photoelectric effect can generate charges on the dielectric surfaces of the paul trap .",
    "these surfaces could be the trap mounts but also insulating oxide layers on the trap electrodes .",
    "the photoelectric effect typically appears with light at wavelengths below about 500@xmath0 nm .",
    "as most of the trapped ion species require light at such  blue \" wavelengths for laser cooling and interrogation , light - induced patch charges will continuously be created while the experiments are carried out .",
    "in addition , patch potentials of category 1 can also be generated in other ways such as the direct deposition of electrons and ions on dielectric surfaces ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "+ patch potentials of category 2 are stable as long as the surface atoms do not move .",
    "they are due to a spatial variation of the material@xmath1s work function which depends on its composition , its crystal orientation and its surface adsorbates @xcite .",
    "surface adsorbates can be elements or compounds which are physically or chemically bound onto the surface .",
    "crystal orientation comes into play for neighboring grains in a polycrystalline structure .",
    "a change in composition comes about e.g. when two different metals are brought into contact .",
    "this gives rise to the contact potential , i.e. the difference of the work functions of the two metals .",
    "ion traps are often loaded from atomic beams which are directed towards the trap center .",
    "if the atomic beam hits the paul trap electrodes , atoms are deposited on the electrode surface , potentially forming contact potentials .",
    "furthermore , as previously mentioned , the formation and deposition of chemical compounds on the trap surface can also create electric stray fields .",
    "+ patch potentials of both categories have been observed to cause deteriorations of paul traps leading to strong ion heating effects@xmath0@xcite .",
    "however , the influence and evolution of the patch potentials of category 2 was often masked by the presence of photo - induced patch potentials .",
    "+ here , we study the long - term dynamics of quasi - static electric fields in a paul trap in an environment where we systematically suppress both continuous surface contamination and continuous photo - induced patch charge build - up .",
    "we observe smooth drifts of the quasi - static electric stray fields on various time scales from days to months .",
    "we interpret these different time scales as indications of different physical and chemical processes that take place .",
    "for example , electric fields induced by the exposure of the trap to laser light typically decay within a few days . fields induced by creating an atomic beam using a barium oven show slower dynamics on the order of months .",
    "after longer time periods without surface contamination and photo - induced charging , the stray electric fields settle smoothly towards a stable value with very small residual drifts as low as 0.03@xmath0v / m per day . + in our setup , we achieve the suppression of surface contamination and photo - induced patch charges as follows .",
    "we create and probe ions ( rb@xmath2 ) in a linear paul trap by using only near - infrared light sources ( @xmath3 = 780@xmath0 nm and 1064@xmath0 nm ) and small clouds of @xmath4 ultracold rb atoms , which have previously been optically transported into the chamber@xmath0@xcite .",
    "thus , the net flux of atoms into the chamber is negligible .",
    "we measure the electric stray fields by applying compensating electric fields until the excess micromotion of the ion is minimized@xmath0@xcite .",
    "[ sec:2 ]    the design of our linear paul trap is shown in fig.@xmath0[fig:1 ] .",
    "the effective distance from the trap center to each of the four radiofrequency ( rf ) electrodes is 2.6@xmath0 mm while the distance to the endcap electrodes measures @xmath5 mm . to create radial confinement , a voltage driven at a frequency of @xmath6mhz with an amplitude of @xmath7v",
    "is applied to two of the rf electrodes while the other two are held at ground potential .",
    "axial confinement is generated by applying static voltages of about @xmath8v to the two endcap electrodes . under these experimental conditions ,",
    "a @xmath9rb@xmath2 ion is confined at radial trapping frequencies of about @xmath10khz and an axial trapping frequency of about @xmath11khz .",
    "the total depth of the trap is on the order of 4@xmath0ev and allows for ion storage times of many days , even without any type of cooling .",
    "the paul trap is part of a hybrid atom - ion trap setup that brings the trapped ion into contact with an ultracold cloud of atoms@xmath0@xcite .",
    "ensembles of @xmath9rb atoms are prepared in a separate vacuum chamber and transported into the paul trap using a long - distance optical transport line .",
    "they are then loaded into a crossed dipole trap where further evaporative cooling down to typical temperatures of 700@xmath0nk is performed .",
    "the atom numbers typically range between @xmath12 and @xmath13 atoms .",
    "both the optical transport and the crossed dipole trap are implemented using several w of laser power at a wavelength of 1064@xmath0 nm . to perform absorption imaging of the atoms , resonant laser light at 780@xmath0 nm",
    "after this destructive imaging process , a new atom cloud is prepared within 30@xmath0s for the next measurement . to load an ion ,",
    "a rb atom cloud with a density of several @xmath14 is prepared and positioned at the center of the paul trap .",
    "three - body recombination processes in the atom cloud produce rb@xmath15 molecules which are subsequently ionized by a rempi process using photons from the dipole trap laser@xmath0@xcite .",
    "subsequently , the molecular rb@xmath16 ions quickly dissociate via collisions with neutral atoms and finally yield rb@xmath2 ions .",
    "+ to detect the number of trapped rb@xmath2 ions and measure their micromotion , we employ a sensitive probing scheme using ultracold atomic clouds@xmath0@xcite . for this",
    ", we immerse the ions into clouds consisting of about @xmath12 atoms at densities around @xmath17 .",
    "after a few seconds of interaction time , we detect the final atom number and atom temperature which depend on the number of ions and their micromotion .",
    "this enables us to reliably work with a single ion and , by minimizing its excess micromotion with the help of electric compensation fields , to measure the stray electric fields acting on the ion@xmath0@xcite . due to the production time",
    "required for the atom clouds , an electric field measurement requires about an hour of measurement time , resulting in a limited temporal resolution .",
    "the measurement precision is high and typically ranges around 0.1@xmath0v / m for the results presented here .",
    "as a first step we investigate the susceptibility of our trap setup with respect to laser light at various wavelengths which are available in our lab ( fig.@xmath0[fig:2 ] ) . for these and the following measurements , each laser beam propagates through the center of the ion trap in horizontal direction at an angle of 45@xmath18 with respect to the trap axis .",
    "in particular , the laser beam and its specular reflection from the vacuum windows do not directly impinge on any trap electrode or trap mount .",
    "only some stray scattered light from the windows illuminates the trap parts diffusely and quite evenly .",
    "both the trap electrodes and the trap mounts can be  charged up \" via the photoelectric effect .",
    "the trap mounts and the mounts for the barium oven are made of machinable glass - ceramic ( macor ) , which is very susceptible for accumulating charges .",
    "charges can also accumulate on the trap electrode surfaces as these often feature undesired insulating coatings such as oxide layers .",
    "as expected , for wavelengths below 500@xmath19 nm we find a sharp increase in light - induced build - up of electric fields ( see fig.2 ) . for 780@xmath0 nm or the even longer wavelength of 1064@xmath0 nm , we did not detect any measurable light - induced electric fields .    in general",
    ", we find the photo - induced stray electric fields to be pointing mostly in vertical ( + @xmath20-axis ) and axial ( + @xmath21-axis ) direction .",
    "there might be a number of reasons how this asymmetry in the direction of the electric stray field comes about .",
    "one reason could be that the laser light illuminates the trap setup asymmetrically .",
    "however , we can exclude this possibility as the field direction is quite insensitive to changes in the propagation direction of the laser light , in particular when it is flipped by 90@xmath22 in the horizontal plane .",
    "another possible explanation for the asymmetry could be the presence , e.g. of a single dust particle on the trap electrodes , which is something we can not rule out .",
    "an obvious asymmetry , however , is already inherent in our paul trap setup due to the location of the mount and aperture plate of the barium oven ( see fig.@xmath01 , lower right ) .",
    "indeed , we estimate that these two parts ( which are made of macor ) can lead to significant electric stray fields at the location of the ion . for one , they can potentially be charged to voltages of up to 500@xmath0v , as determined by the amplitude of the rf trap drive .",
    "( the rf fields prevent the patch potentials from saturating at a low voltage , the value of which would be normally set by the difference of the work function and the photon energy . ) secondly , our trap geometry is relatively open such that external electric fields can penetrate quite well to the position of the ion",
    ". we can not deterministically charge the aperture plate or the oven mount to a certain voltage in order to test their effect on the electric field at the position of the ion .",
    "however , we can apply voltages to the ba oven itself which should create electric fields of similar magnitude and orientation .",
    "we find that a voltage of 1@xmath0v on the oven indeed results in a dominant electric field contribution of @xmath23v / m in @xmath20-direction .",
    "the other two field components are each about a factor of 6 smaller ( @xmath24v / m in @xmath25-direction and @xmath26v / m in @xmath21-direction ) .",
    "these values set a lower bound to the expected fields originating from a charged aperture plate which is located closer to the ion than the oven .",
    "next , we start a long - term experiment where we monitor the evolution of all three spatial components of the stray electric field over a time span of about four months ( fig.@xmath0[fig:3 ] ) . before the start of these measurements ,",
    "the ion trap was operated with ba@xmath2 ions so that both the barium oven and the necessary lasers were frequently used .",
    "consequently , there is a substantial stray electric field to begin with . during the measurements ( except for two short occasions )",
    "the whole experimental setup is almost entirely shielded from ambient light by means of light - tight protective covers to avoid any patch charge build - up .",
    "all three electric field components ( in @xmath25 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 direction ) show a more or less monotonic decay and converge towards long - term limits which are each set to @xmath27 in the plot .",
    "the solid lines in fig.@xmath0[fig:3 ] are double - exponential fits of the form    @xmath28    where @xmath29 are the electric field shifts and @xmath30 are the time constants of the exponential decay curves .",
    "for the two radial directions ( @xmath25- and @xmath20-directions ) we find relatively rapid initial decays with time constants @xmath31 days ( see inset of fig.@xmath0[fig:3 ] ) and subsequent slow decays with @xmath32 days . in axial direction the time constants are @xmath33 and @xmath34days .",
    "for all three directions the slow decays are dominant as they account for roughly 80 - 95@xmath0% of the electric field shifts ( see table@xmath01 ) .",
    "+ on two occasions ( @xmath35days and @xmath36days ) , the light - tight protective covers around the experimental setup had to be removed for several hours so that the paul trap was subjected ( quite uniformly ) to ambient white light from the fluorescent ceiling lights . as a consequence , the electric field in vertical ( @xmath20 ) direction shows a sharp increase and then decays back towards its long - term behavior within several days .",
    "we investigate this effect in detail below .",
    "+ after about 100 days , the daily drift of the vertical field was below @xmath37v / m yielding extremely stable experimental conditions . in addition , this slow drift allows for a precise prediction of the expected electric fields at a given time so that the field compensation can be adjusted without requiring additional measurements .",
    "after the time period shown in fig.@xmath0[fig:3 ] , we make use of the low stray field drift to selectively test the dynamics of photo - induced patch charges . for this measurement",
    "we shine through the chamber about 2.5@xmath0mw of laser power at a wavelength of 413@xmath0 nm ( 3@xmath0ev ) for 4 minutes .",
    "the direction of the laser beam and the conditions with respect to trap illumination are the same as for the measurements in fig.@xmath02 , as discussed in the beginning of section 3 .",
    "the strongest effect is again observed in the vertical electric field component which increases by about 6@xmath19v / m .",
    "the axial field component increases by 1.5@xmath0v / m , the horizontal component by 0.6@xmath0v / m . the laser was then switched off and the decay of the vertical field component was monitored over 5 days ( fig.@xmath0[fig:4 ] ) .",
    "the data is fit by a double - exponential curve with an initial decay on a timescale @xmath38days and a slow decay with @xmath39days .",
    "this slow decay accounts for about 80@xmath0% of the field shift .",
    "the observed initial increase and subsequent decay of the electric field are in rough agreement with the behavior seen in fig.@xmath0[fig:3 ] after the paul trap had been subjected to ambient light .",
    "thus , our data in figs . 3 and 4 clearly indicate that photo - induced electric fields decay on typical timescales of a few days .",
    "+ we explain the evolution of the photo - induced stray fields as follows : initially , the photoelectric effect generates charges on electrically isolated surfaces resulting in electric stray potentials . over time these potentials discharge by the finite resistivity of the material . in case of a charging of the aperture plate or the oven",
    "mount we can estimate a timescale for the discharge .",
    "at room temperature , macor has a specific volume resistivity of about 10@xmath40 cm .",
    "the typical resistance of a cm - sized component then is on the order of 10@xmath41 .",
    "the electric capacitance of a @xmath42-sized plate is about 4@xmath43 cm , with @xmath44 denoting the vacuum permittivity .",
    "thus , the decay constant is on the order of 10 hours , which roughly agrees with our observed time scales .",
    "we note that the resistivity of macor is strongly temperature dependent .",
    "we do not have a precise knowledge of the temperature of the mount but from our estimate it is clear that time scales for the discharging of the macor parts should not be much longer than a few days .",
    "the fact that we observe not only a single timescale for the field decay indicates that there is more than one contribution to the stray fields .",
    "a charged up macor part might exhibit a different discharge behavior than a dust particle or an isolated patch on the electrode surface . in any case , the data in fig . 4 and especially in fig .",
    "3 ( at t @xmath45 and t @xmath46 days ) clearly indicate that photo - induced fields always decay on a timescale faster than two weeks .",
    "the question is then how the very slow drift taking place over about 90 days can be explained ( see fig.@xmath0[fig:3 ] ) .",
    "our observatios suggest that the electric fields linked to this slow decay have a different origin than the photoelectric effect .",
    "+ we conjecture that the slow drifts originate from the dynamics of potentials of category 2 , e.g. contact potentials .",
    "these potentials may change due to slow chemical reactions in the ultrahigh vacuum environment or by diffusion and migration processes on the electrode surface .",
    "it is known that barium reacts and forms compounds with o@xmath15 , n@xmath15 , co@xmath15 and h@xmath15o . it also acts as a getter material , inclosing non - reactive gases .",
    "thus , the mobility of ba on a surface is sizeable .",
    "( interestingly , the work function of barium is known to remain quite constant ( @xmath47ev ) even when contaminated with other substances . ) diffusion or migration of barium on the electrode surface can coat certain compound layers and set other ones free  thus giving rise to slowly changing contact potentials . at room temperature",
    "the vapor pressure of barium is very low .",
    "even at 200@xmath22c it only reaches @xmath48 mbar .",
    "this suggests that barium coatings have a long lifetime at ambient temperatures .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     previous studies have investigated the influence of barium contaminations on paul trap electrodes made of be - cu@xmath0@xcite .",
    "long time scales for the quasi - static electric stray field drifts on the order of months were found , similar to our time constant for the slow drift ( @xmath49days ) in fig.@xmath0[fig:3 ] .",
    "furthermore , it was found in@xmath0@xcite that baking out a paul trap with tungsten electrodes that had been coated with ba significantly changed electric stray fields .    in order to test our conjecture",
    ", we now investigate the influence of the barium oven ( while keeping any light below a wavelength of 780@xmath0 nm blocked off ) . immediately after the measurements of fig.@xmath04",
    "are completed , the oven is heated to a temperature of more than 600@xmath18c for 10 minutes inducing a drop of the vertical electric field component by about 7.5@xmath19v / m ( fig.@xmath0[fig:5 ] ) .",
    "the horizontal and axial fields each drop by about 2@xmath0v / m ( not shown ) . + this electric field drop may be partially explained by a rapid discharging of left - over light - induced charges on the oven mount caused by the heat dissipated by the oven .",
    "the conductivity of macor increases by more than ten orders of magnitude when heated from room temperature to several hundred @xmath22c .",
    "it can thus be expected that any left - over charges in the vicinity of the oven will be efficiently removed at such high temperatures .",
    "however , the electric field @xmath50 drops much further than the initial value of @xmath51v / m in fig.@xmath04 , namely down to @xmath52v / m .",
    "this additional negative electric field drop can not be explained by the discharge of the charges that were previously produced photoelectrically .",
    "+ one possible explanation for this field contribution is the effect of contact potentials on the trap electrodes . despite the collimation of the atomic beam through the aperture plate",
    ", a fraction of the atoms emerging from the barium oven reaches the rf electrodes close to the trap center .",
    "such a coating of the electrodes might immediately change the distribution of the contact potentials in close vicinity to the ion .",
    "these potentials can be on the order of a few v , as determined by the difference in work function of the metals involved . in our setup",
    "there is a clear asymmetry on how the ba oven may coat the trap electrodes with ba atoms .",
    "the two lower rf electrodes will each be coated only on one side , whereas the two upper electrodes will probably be coated over the full tip .",
    "it is then to be expected that contact potentials of the upper electrodes dominate over the potentials of the lower ones .",
    "as the work function of ba is lower than that of stainless steel , an electric field component should build up which points towards the negative @xmath20-axis .",
    "this is indeed what we observe .",
    "furthermore , there is also an asymmetry in @xmath21-direction , as the atomic beam from the oven passes at an angle of about 45@xmath22 through the blades ( see fig.@xmath01 ) .",
    "this may give rise to an electric stray field component in @xmath21-direction .",
    "+ fig.@xmath05 shows that after the oven is turned off , the vertical electric field component increases by about 0.5@xmath0v / m per day .",
    "such a behavior agrees with the observations at the beginning of the long - term measurements shown in the inset of fig.@xmath0[fig:3 ] .",
    "this again supports our interpretation that the 90-day long drift behavior of the electric field in fig.@xmath0[fig:3 ] is a result of initially coating the trap electrodes and mounts with ba which afterwards migrates and undergoes chemical reactions on the surface .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the long - term drifts of quasi - static electric stray fields in a linear paul trap .",
    "we find drifts on time scales ranging from about half a day to three months .",
    "we suggest that these different time scales reflect different physical or chemical processes .",
    "light - induced electric fields decay on relatively short time scales on the order of a few days .",
    "this is most probably due to charges located on insulating material which slowly discharge via the high electric resistance .",
    "in contrast , electric fields which are induced by turning on the ba oven exhibit long - term drifts on time scales of up to 90 days . guided by analysis , our interpretation is that the oven coats the trap electrodes or mounts . as a consequence ,",
    "contact potentials appear which give rise to the electric fields .",
    "these fields show long - term drifts possibly due to slow migration or reaction processes taking place on the electrode surface .",
    "+ patch potentials have been identified as the common source of both quasi - static and fluctuating electric fields .",
    "the time scales for the drifts and fluctuations of these fields is reflected by the dynamics taking place on different length scales of the patches .",
    "it has been found that atomic contamination of paul traps lead to both quasi - static and rapidly fluctuating patch fields@xmath0@xcite .",
    "our findings on the evolution and the origins of quasi - static charges may thus provide new insights into mechanisms connected to rapidly fluctuating charges such as anomalous heating effects .",
    "the results presented here are a first investigation with our setup in the direction of surface dynamics of patch potentials . in the future",
    "the experiments can easily be refined to obtain more detailed information and to test hypotheses .",
    "for example , by locally applying laser fields on trap mounts and electrodes ( either to heat them up or to produce photo - induced patch charges in a controlled way ) , we should be able to spatially probe surface properties .",
    "another result of our work is that by systematically avoiding the creation of electric patch potentials we are able to get into a regime of very small and predictable electric stray field drifts as low as @xmath37v / m per day .",
    "such stability of the trap conditions may prove valuable for the future development of precision ion trap experiments .",
