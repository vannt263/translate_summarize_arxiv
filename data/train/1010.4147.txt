    "after the first experimental realization of the bose - einstein condensates ( becs)@xcite , this field and its related topics attracted more attentions@xcite .",
    "bec in an optical lattice @xcite has relation with many problems in the condensed matter physics , e.g. bloch oscillations@xcite , wannier - stark ladders@xcite , josephson junction arrays@xcite and superfluid to the mott - insulator transition@xcite .",
    "behavior of a rotating bec in an optical lattice , is similar to that of a superconductor in the magnetic field@xcite . here with a trap potential without the lattice structure ,",
    "the abrikosov vortex lattice can be observed@xcite .",
    "when the lattice structure adds to the trap potential , the vortex lattice changes @xcite and with some criterions , this study can be mapped on the problem of the josephson junction arrays ( jjas ) ; there will be the same vortex structure for both systems@xcite .",
    "most of the studies in this field has been done on the lattice potentials with the square symmetries and few works on the bec with other symmetries@xcite . yet",
    "due to the possibility of the realization of the optical lattices with different symmetries @xciteand with more than one spatial frequency@xcite , the study of the bec in the quasiperiodic potentials can be useful@xcite .    here",
    "we focus on the study of the problem in the jja regime .",
    "we formulate the problem of the ground state for the jja hamiltonian in terms of the vortex configuration and then we discuss about the exact numerical result for the few number of the lattice points , and the monte - carlo method for a large lattice .",
    "we exploit harmonic approximation for the cosine hamiltonian of the system and find energy for any given vortex configuration .",
    "also we study the problem for the ladder case ; this case can be used as the reduced two dimensional case@xcite and can inspire the general behavior of the ground state structure in the 2d lattice case .",
    "this method is faster than the monte - carlo method for the original hamiltonian and directly results the vortex lattice , while in other methods instead of the vortex , the circulation has been used for the determination of the vortex position@xcite .",
    "in this section we show how in some approximation , rotating bec in an optical lattice can be modeled as josephson junction arrays@xcite .",
    "hamiltonian for a bec in an optical lattice with a rotation frequency @xmath0 is , @xmath1\\hat{\\psi}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the atomic mass and @xmath3 the coupling constant with the @xmath4-wave scattering length @xmath5 .",
    "conservation of the total number of particles is ensured by chemical potential @xmath6 .",
    "the external potential @xmath7 consists of two parts : modified harmonic potential @xmath8 and the potential of the optical lattice @xmath9 , which may be chosen as periodic@xcite , quasiperiodic@xcite , or random@xcite .",
    "for example , the potential with square symmetry can be written as @xmath10 $ ] , with the periodicity @xmath11 .    for a large @xmath12",
    ", we can suppose that system is frozen in axial direction .",
    "if energy due to interaction and rotation is small compared to the energy separation between the lowest and first excited band , the particles are confined to the lowest wannier orbitals@xcite .",
    "therefore we can write @xmath13 in the wannier basis as ,    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the analog of the magnetic vector potential , @xmath16 the normalized wannier wave - function localized in the @xmath17-th well and @xmath18 the number operator . substituting [ wannier ] in hamiltonian [ bechami ]",
    "leads to the bose - hubbard model in the rotating frame    @xmath19    where @xmath20 means @xmath17 and @xmath21 are nearest neighbors , @xmath22 is the hopping matrix element , @xmath23 an energy offset of each lattice site and @xmath24 the on - site energy .",
    "the rotation effect is described by @xmath25 proportional to the line integral of @xmath26 between the @xmath17-th and @xmath21-th sites : @xmath27 .",
    "if the number of atoms per sites is large ( @xmath28 ) , the operator can be expressed in terms of its amplitude and phase , and the amplitude by the @xmath29-number as @xmath30 . using @xmath31 and @xmath32 , eq .",
    "[ bosehubbard ] reduces to the quantum phase model @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "also , the atoms are assumed to be distributed such as they satisfy the condition @xmath35 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath36 decreases from the central sites outward because @xmath37 has the profile of an inverted parabola as we can see from solution of 1d case in fig .",
    "[ oned ] .",
    "is enveloped by an inverted parabola shape.,width=377 ]    [ oned ]    eq .",
    "2.4 is just the hamiltonian of a lattice of small josephson junctions with inhomogeneous coupling constants @xmath36 . with @xmath38",
    ", we can neglect the kinetic energy term ; moreover , we suppose that coupling constants are equal @xmath39 .",
    "this regime can be achieved when the depth of optical lattice @xmath40 is between 18 and 25@xmath41 ( @xmath42 is recoil energy ) and average particle number is @xmath43@xcite .",
    "then we have : @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "our purpose is to find minimum of this hamiltonian as a function of condensate phases @xmath46 with two constraints as follows .",
    "first constraint originates in the single valuedness of the wave function which leads to the quantization of vorticity : @xmath47 where sum is over @xmath48th plaquette , @xmath49 is area of @xmath48th plaquette , and @xmath50 is integer . in the case of a condensate with the rigid - body rotation , _ the frustration parameter _ is defined as @xmath51 with the quantum circulation @xmath52 . in two dimensional arrays , frustration represents density of vortices per number of lattice plaquettes @xcite .",
    "the second constraint comes from conservation of the particles numbers .",
    "the particle current from the nodes can be assumed as the derivation of the energy function with respect to the corresponding phase@xcite .",
    "this leads to @xmath53 where sum is over all @xmath21 which is connected to @xmath17th node .",
    "since hamiltonian is periodic , @xmath50 can be @xmath54 or @xmath55 , and we can replace them by @xmath50 which is zero or one , and replace @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "these two set of equations can completely determine all @xmath58 for a given set of @xmath50 .",
    "also , for a lattice , number of plaquettes plus number of nodes is equal to number of connections minus one ; therefore one of the equations ( e.g. one of particle conservation equations ) can be neglected . assuming the particle flow from the nodes are small , we can linearize the eq.[ccons ] i.e. @xmath59 . now",
    ", we have a linear set of equations which must be solved for a given set of integers @xmath50 , i.e. for a vortex configuration .",
    "energy of this vortex configuration is denoted by @xmath60 . then instead of original minimization scheme",
    ", we can use the set of these energies for minimization of hamiltonian .",
    "it means that minimum of hamiltonian correspond to a vortex configuration which minimizes these set of energies , with number of vortex configuration equal to @xmath61 where @xmath62 is number of plaquettes in the lattice .",
    "in this section , we apply the formulation of previous section on a ladder geometry and find an exact analytical formula for energy of vortex configuration .",
    "it is known that a ladder geometry can give an insight about ground state vortex structure in 2d lattices@xcite . as we will see the symmetry of the problem in this case ,",
    "reduces the number of equations such that there will be @xmath62 linear algebraic equations to solve , where @xmath62 is number of plaquettes .",
    "one of difference between problems in josephson junction arrays and bec lattices is boundary condition which is imposed on lattice . in the josephson junction arrays ,",
    "the behavior of the arrays with large number of plaquettes is interesting@xcite , therefore the boundary condition of lattice is usually assumed as periodic , i.e. the first plaquette is connected to the last plaquette . for becs ,",
    "the number of lattice sites is usually finite and free or fixed boundary condition are more suitable .",
    "conservation of current [ ccons ] imposes that current in upper and lower junctions of a plaquette and therefore their corresponding @xmath58 will be equal .",
    "we denote gauge invariant phase difference for upper and lower junctions of @xmath48th plaquette by @xmath63 and those of the vertical junctions between @xmath48 and @xmath64th plaquette by @xmath65 .",
    "then the node current equations read @xmath66 and the linearized approximation gives    @xmath67    imposing this equation on the flux quantization 2.6 , we have    @xmath68    for the @xmath48th plaquette with fixed boundary condition : @xmath69 , where @xmath62 is number of plaquettes in ladder .",
    "we have left now with @xmath62 equations and @xmath70 variables . denoting coefficient matrix by @xmath71 ,",
    "we can write    @xmath72    where @xmath73 , and @xmath74 is inverse of coefficient matrix and its elements are , @xmath75 where @xmath76 , and @xmath77 and @xmath78 are defined with appropriate summation .    by using eq .",
    "[ gammaladder ] we can find the energy ( normalized by the number of junctions ) for a vortex configuration @xmath79 as : @xmath80    related to the problem of minimizing the hamiltonian , each vortex configuration can be vortex configuration with minimum energy for a definite value , or an interval of @xmath81 .",
    "then for each value of frustration we need calculate the energy for all the vortex configurations . as an example",
    ", we begin with a square ladder ( @xmath82 ) with @xmath83 plaquette in which we just need to study @xmath84 . in fig .",
    "[ sq8en ] we have plotted ground state energy by the above procedure : @xmath81 is incremented from @xmath85 to @xmath86 by @xmath87 and for each value of @xmath81 , energy of all the configurations is calculated and the least value has been chosen .",
    "we have specified each vortex configuration by a number @xmath2 which in the binary representation with @xmath62 digit ( @xmath62 is number of plaquettes ) gives the configuration of the vortices with every one , meaning there is vortex on that plaquette .",
    "for example @xmath88 means a vortex configuration @xmath89 , i.e. there are two vortices on the @xmath90th and @xmath83th plaquettes .",
    "fixing @xmath81 we can demonstrate the dependence of the energy to the configuration of the vortices . in fig .",
    "[ sq8vet ] we have plot energy vs. vortex configuration for @xmath91 and @xmath92 where the vortex configuration is labeled as we noted above . for @xmath91",
    "we see a mirror symmetry , it means that vortex configurations @xmath2 and @xmath93 have the same energy .",
    "more general rule for square ladder with arbitrary @xmath81 can be deduced easily from above equations : vortex configuration @xmath2 for @xmath81 and @xmath93 for @xmath94 has same energy .",
    "therefore , if vortex configuration @xmath2 has the minimum energy for @xmath81 , then vortex configuration @xmath93 has the minimum energy for @xmath94 .",
    "this means that for @xmath91 , the minimum energy is twofold degenerate .",
    "for example for the ladder considered above , both @xmath95 and @xmath96 configurations give the minimum energy . in fig .",
    "[ sq8vp ] we have shown position of vortices for different @xmath81 .",
    "this figure shows that behavior of vortex is similar to the behavior of a charge @xmath97 on a lattice with opposite sign onsite charges@xcite .",
    "when we have one vortex on lattice , the vortex prefers to sit on middle of ladder , where in this case it can be two plaquettes 4 or 5 .",
    "when we have two vortices on ladder , they prefer to divide ladder into three equal parts , which means that they must be on plaquettes 3 and 6 . this description can be applied to vortex configurations with more vortices .    , energy of all vortex configurations is calculated and the smallest value has been chosen.,width=340 ]    [ sq8en ]     in ( a ) and @xmath98 in ( b).,width=340 ]    [ sq8vet ]        [ sq8vp ]    for more accurate results , we can relax linear approximation for the current equation and use newton - raphson method , with the initial estimation from linear approximation .",
    "for above case , we compare linear approximation and 10 iterates of newton - raphson method in fig .",
    "it worth to mention while energy differences are small but , in some small intervals of @xmath81 , different vortex configurations give the minimum energy .",
    "when @xmath62 number of plaquettes grows , number of possible vortex configurations grows as @xmath99 , and expect for small number of plaquettes we can not determine the exact minimum vortex configuration which needs checking all of vortex configuration .",
    "therefore we use a monte - carlo method : we start from a high temperature @xmath100 and a random vortex lattice @xmath101 and calculate its energy @xmath102",
    ". then we decrease temperature gradually and for each temperature we do following process a few times : we change the configuration randomly to @xmath103 with energy @xmath104 , we accept the new configuration if @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a random number between @xmath85 and @xmath86 , and @xmath107 .",
    "when temperature receives @xmath108 , we take the final configuration as ground state .",
    "[ linr ]    for a periodic lattice finding the ground state from the mc method is troublesome for nonzero frustration@xcite . to check the validity of our method , instead",
    ", we apply the method on a quasiperiodic lattice e.g. a fibonacci ladder .",
    "the fibonacci ladders contains two types of plaquettes with lengths 1 and @xmath109 .",
    "if we denote plaquette with length 1 and @xmath110 , by @xmath111 and @xmath112 respectively , then these two types of plaquettes arranged in bases of the following rule : for @xmath113th step of construction , we add @xmath114th step to end of @xmath101th step . with first step @xmath111 and second step @xmath112 , we have : @xmath115 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ comparison ] along with the result of using the monte - carlo on the original hamiltonian , with a good agreement ( we note that for a aperiodic lattice it is not sufficient to study @xmath116 ) . for a square lattice ,",
    "increasing @xmath81 from @xmath85 to @xmath117 , both the number of the vortices and the magnitude of vorticity grow @xcite and the linear approximation may seem unreasonable .",
    "[ comparison ] shows that despite this fact , the approximate results are in a good agreement with the results of the direct method .",
    "[ comparison ]",
    "the configuration of the vortex lattice of rotating becs in an optical lattice is investigated . for deep optical lattices",
    "when the number of particles in each site is large , the problem of rotating bec in an optical lattice , can be mapped onto the model of arrays of josephson junctions in presence of an external magnetic field . in this approximation",
    "we have formulated a vortex configuration for the ground state .",
    "our result for ladder case is presented and is in good agreement with monte - carlo result with original jja hamiltonian .",
    "this method can be extended to 2d case , and also cases with non - uniform coupling which looks more relevant for study of rotating becs . in these cases , with linear approximation , we deal with a set of linear algebraic equations for each vortex configuration which can be solved easily by use of proposed method .",
    "effect of non - uniform coupling can affect the results especially in the situation of high density of vortices as in the case @xmath91 for square lattice . also as a better approximation we can consider finite @xmath118 ,",
    "then problem is similar to the arrays of small josephson junctions@xcite .",
    "we can also suppose that coupling is time - dependent which can occur in case of a vibrating optical lattice@xcite .",
    "then problem can be treated as a set of coupled pendulum equations with time - dependent lengths@xcite .",
