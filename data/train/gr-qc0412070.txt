    "the production of higher - dimensional black holes in collider  @xcite is the important prediction arising from the large extra dimension scenario  @xcite or the warped compactification ( rs1 ) scenario  @xcite , where the fundamental ( higher - dimensional ) scale of gravitation can be set to the order of tev .",
    "such phenomena would strongly suggest the presence of the extra dimensions , and we would also obtain the experimental method to seek for the quantum gravity .",
    "hence , it is important to investigate the fundamental properties of higher - dimensional black holes such as stability , which is the subject of the present paper .",
    "there is a variety of the higher - dimensional black objects with nontrivial topology unlike those in four - dimensional space - times where each component of stationary black hole is a topological two - sphere .",
    "in fact , higher - dimensional vacuum einstein equation admits simple solutions called black branes which are direct product of the four - dimensional schwarzschild black hole and the flat space .",
    "we are usually interested in the case where the flat dimensions in the black brane space - time are compactified into say a torus .",
    "gregory and laflamme  @xcite have found that the black branes are unstable under linear gravitational perturbations when the compactification scales are large compared with the schwarzschild radius . on the other hand , ishibashi and kodama  @xcite",
    "have shown that the higher - dimensional schwarzschild black holes in the spherically symmetric space - times are gravitationally stable as in the case with the four space - time dimensions .",
    "an accurate way to compute the quasinormal frequencies of higher - dimensional schwarzschild black holes has been obtained via 6th order wkb approximation  @xcite .",
    "it is also important to consider the stability of the rotating black holes , since black holes produced in the collider generically have angular momenta and the production cross section is larger for more rapidly rotating black holes  @xcite in contrast to the kerr - bound on four - dimensional rotating black holes , there are black hole solutions with an arbitrary large angular momentum for a fixed mass in higher - dimensional general relativity .",
    "recently , the existence of the effective kerr - bound on such rapidly rotating black holes in higher dimension has been conjectured by emparan and myers  @xcite .",
    "they showed that the geometry of the event horizon of such rapidly rotating black holes in six or higher dimension behaves like the black membranes and argued that such rapidly rotating black holes therefore become unstable .",
    "although we should analyze the gravitational perturbations of rotating black holes to confirm such instability , any formalism where the perturbative equations are separable is yet unknown .",
    "here we just consider the perturbation of the massless scalar field propagating on the rotating black hole space - times .",
    "even if we restrict ourselves to field perturbation on fixed background space - time , there exists an instability of massless field perturbation on rotating black branes and strings discovered by cardoso and lemos  @xcite .",
    "the equation of motion for the massless scalar field perturbation on the rotating black holes is known to be separable in any dimension  @xcite , and authors examined the stability of this system in five - dimension as the simplest case in the previous work  @xcite .",
    "the present paper is the complementary work on the renewed interest in the instability ( or stability ) of the rapidly rotating black holes in six dimensions .",
    "the @xmath0-dimensional myers - perry metric  @xcite with only one nonzero angular momentum is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 denotes the standard metric of the unit @xmath4-sphere .",
    "this metric describes a rotating black hole in asymptotically flat , vacuum space - time with the mass and angular momentum proportional to @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "hereafter , @xmath7 are assumed .",
    "the event horizon is located at @xmath8 , such that @xmath9 , which is homeomorphic to @xmath10 . for @xmath11",
    ", @xmath12 always has a positive root for arbitrary @xmath13 , namely regular black hole solutions exist with arbitrarily large angular momentum per unit mass .    in the limit where @xmath14 , the coordinate radius of the horizon is approximated by @xmath15 .",
    "hence , the horizon radius @xmath16 shrinks to zero when one take the limit where @xmath14 with fixed @xmath5 . to avoid a vanishing horizon radius , emparan and myers introduced the black membrane limit where @xmath14 and @xmath17 with fixed @xmath18 . in this limit",
    ", the myers - perry metric behaves like a black membrane metric near the pole @xmath19 : @xmath20 where the new coordinate is defined by @xmath21 . in this paper",
    ", we are concerned with the dimensionless kerr parameter @xmath22 .",
    "the limit where @xmath23 with fixed @xmath16 is consistent to the membrane limit .",
    "here we consider the perturbation of the massless scalar field on the background myers - perry metric  ( [ eq : myersperry ] ) .",
    "we put the scalar field configuration as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the hyperspherical harmonics on the @xmath4-sphere with the eigenvalue @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",

    "we will solve the eigenvalue problem under the quasinormal boundary condition : @xmath31 where @xmath32    when @xmath33 , the eigenfunctions for the angular equation  ( [ eq : angular ] ) are analytically given in terms of the hypergeometric functions : @xmath34 with the eigenvalues @xmath35 then @xmath36 behaves as the hyperspherical harmonics on @xmath10 , which belongs to the irreducible representation of the rotational group @xmath37 .",
    "especially for @xmath38 , the hyperspherical function on @xmath39 with the eigenvalue @xmath40 belongs to the representation characterized by the dynkin index @xmath41 $ ] and has @xmath42-fold degeneracy .",
