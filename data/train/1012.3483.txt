    "the malvenuto - reutenauer hopf algebra of ordered trees  @xcite and the loday - ronco hopf algebra of planar binary trees  @xcite are cofree as coalgebras and are connected by cellular maps from the permutahedra to the associahedra .",
    "closely related polytopes include stasheff s multiplihedra  @xcite and the composihedra  @xcite , and it is natural to study to what extent hopf structures may be placed on these objects .",
    "the map from permutahedra to associahedra factors through the multiplihedra , and in  @xcite we used this factorization to place hopf structures on bi - leveled trees , which correspond to vertices of multiplihedra .",
