    "one of the abiding interests in materials science is the synthesis and characterization of new materials that locate near the metal - insulator boundary .",
    "such materials exhibit some of the most important properties of condensed matter physics ; for example the high-@xmath3 superconductivity , a commensurate and incommensurate charge density wave , the mixed - valency effect , and mott - hubbard transitions .",
    "rare - earth dichalcogenides ( rex@xmath0 , re = rare - earth , x = se , te ) have drawn attentions because they might have a charge density wave ( cdw ) transition like nbse@xmath4.@xcite to date , however , dyse@xmath5 is the only one known to have such a cdw instability among the rare - earth dichalcogenides.@xcite interestingly , most rex@xmath0 compounds have a strong two dimensional character in physical properties arising from their tetragonal cu@xmath0sb - type structure .",
    "this structure are based on two motifs .",
    "one is a corrugated cubic layer of rare - earth elements and te atoms , and the other is a planar square lattice sheet of chalcogen atoms .",
    "the orbitals of the 4-fold coordinated chalcogens in the sheet are expected to broaden into dispersive bands inducing metallic behavior along the basal plane.@xcite",
    "we made rex@xmath0 samples ( re = la , pr , sm , and gd ) as described elsewhere.@xcite the crystal structure of all the samples was checked by x - ray analysis . in order to obtain clean surface for photoemission spectroscopy measurements",
    ", we scraped the samples _ in situ_. photoelectron spectra were taken by a ha-150 concentrical hemispherical analyser , which is attached to a ultra high vacuum ( uhv ) system , of the vsw scientific instruments , england . during",
    "the experiments pressure was better than @xmath6 mbar .",
    "we used al-@xmath7 ( @xmath8 ev ) for the measurement of rare earth @xmath1 and te @xmath1 peaks , and he i and he ii ( @xmath9 = 21.2 and 40.8 ev respectively ) for the measurement of rare earth @xmath10 and valence band spectra .",
    "o @xmath11 and c @xmath11 signals were used to ensure that sample surface was clear of other contaminants . for the ups experiments we did not observe any c and o related peaks . however , in the case of xps c @xmath11 and o @xmath12 core - level peaks were detected .",
    "these c and o peaks , we think , came from the sample holder since a wider sample area was usually covered by the x - ray source than the he discharge lamp . therefore , we calibrated all core level spectra against the c @xmath11 peak .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the @xmath1 core - level spectra of late@xmath0 , prte@xmath0 , smte@xmath0 , and gdte@xmath0 , which are typical of rare earth compounds . in all four spectra",
    ", we can see double peak structures due to the spin - orbit splitting of ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) , and their satellites as in other rare earth compounds.@xcite that the @xmath1 core - level spectra are very similar to each other suggests that all the rare earth elements should be trivalent .",
    "the late@xmath0 data in figure [ fig1 ] ( a ) show a double - peak structure due to spin - orbit splitting like other rare earth compounds .",
    "the secondary loss peak near 870 ev is due to an inelastic scattering process . as in other rare earth samples",
    ", we think that the main peaks and satellite are @xmath15 and @xmath16 peaks , respectively ( underline denotes a hole state ) . in the formulation of gunnarsson and schnhammer ( gs ) ,",
    "the anderson impurity hamiltonian ( aih ) can be written as : @xmath17\\\\   & & + [ \\varepsilon_c n_c + u_{fc}(1-n_c ) \\sum_{m",
    "\\sigma}a^\\dag_{m   \\sigma}a_{m\\sigma}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it contains a conduction band with energy dispersion @xmath18 , and an impurity atom level of degeneracy @xmath19 with the energy @xmath20 corresponding to the total energy difference between consecutive @xmath21-occupations when hybridization and @xmath21-coulomb correlation energies are ignored .",
    "@xmath22 is the on - site @xmath21-@xmath21 coulomb repulsion which is the energy needed for the formation of two non - interacting @xmath23 and @xmath24 states .",
    "@xmath25 is a hopping matrix element between the @xmath21 orbital and a conduction state .",
    "the term in the second square brackets is considered in order to describe the excitations of a deep core level at an energy @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the attraction energy between an @xmath21 state and the core hole , @xmath28 the electron occupation in the core level.@xcite calculations of core level xps spectral functions using the aih model hamiltonian shows that the satellite structure depends strongly upon the hybridization strength . according to the calculations ,",
    "the satellite of la @xmath1 at the lower binding energy side is well screened @xmath1 peaks by charge transferred electrons from ligands . for the model calculations using the gunnarsson and schnhammer approximation,@xcite we used the following set of model parameters ; hybridization parameter @xmath29 ev , correlation energy between rare - earth @xmath10 electrons @xmath30 ev , core-@xmath21 coulomb attraction interaction @xmath31 ev , @xmath32 core level binding energy @xmath33= 836.4 ev , and spin - orbit splitting @xmath34 16.8 ev . using this set of model parameters",
    ", we found that the experimental la @xmath1 line shape can be well explainable .",
    "table [ tbl1 ] shows the summary of these fitting results .",
    "figures [ fig1 ] ( b ) and ( c ) show the pr and sm @xmath1 core level spectra of a double peak structure due to the spin orbit splitting ( @xmath35 ev , @xmath36 ev , @xmath37 ev , and @xmath38 ev ) .",
    "we can also see a secondary loss peak near 975 ev which is due to inelastic scattering of pr @xmath1 spectrum .",
    "additional surface satellite peaks are shown at the lower binding energy side of @xmath1 peaks in smte@xmath0 . for both pr and",
    "sm , a new structure appears at the higher binding energy side of @xmath14 . as to the origin of this structure",
    ", we think that there are two possible explanations .",
    "one is a @xmath10 induced multiplet effect like gd @xmath1 multiplet and the other is a stoichiometric effect .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] ( d ) shows the gd @xmath13 and @xmath14 peaks of gdte@xmath0 .",
    "these data exhibit main and satellite structures as in the trivalent gd compounds .",
    "one note that the satellite peak appears at a higher binding energy for the trivalent gd compounds than the main peak corresponds to the @xmath39 electronic configuration .    in figure [ fig2 ] , we show the x - ray photoelectron spectra of te @xmath1 of late@xmath0 , prte@xmath0 , smte@xmath0 , and gdte@xmath0 .",
    "we note that the position and the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the peaks appear to have almost the same values for all rare earth compounds .",
    "this similarity in the te @xmath1 spectra , we think , supports the foregone conclusion that all the rare earth elements have the same 3 + valence . in that case",
    ", the te ligands would have a similar chemical valency . on the other hand",
    ", a careful inspection reveals that the line width of the te @xmath1 is slightly broader than in typical te semiconductors .",
    "it is likely to be due to the probably two chemical phases of te in rete@xmath0 .",
    "as we noted before , rete@xmath0 is a strongly two dimensional material .",
    "there are two crystallographically different sites for te atoms in the structure .",
    "one of te atoms sits in the corrugated cubic layer of rare earth and te atoms , and the other one in the planar square lattice sheet of te atoms.@xcite therefore , we expect that te atoms at the two different sites would experience different chemical environments leading to a slight difference in the te @xmath1 spectra . the curve fitting results are summarized at table [ tbl2 ] .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] is the valence band spectra of rare earth ditellurides taken with a he i ( @xmath40 ev ) discharge lamp .",
    "experiments using a he ii source produce more or less similar data when the background is properly subtracted off .",
    "the valence band spectra with the he i and he ii sources also attest to the quality of the samples since these spectra do not show any o and c related structure .    in figure 3",
    ", the fermi level of each spectrum and the spectral position were determined using the fermi edge of ag valence band measured at the same experimental cycle as the rete@xmath0 data .",
    "these valence band spectra taken with the he discharge lamp reflect mainly the te @xmath41-band because the photoionization cross - section of rare earth @xmath10 is much smaller than that of the te @xmath41-band@xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the case of gd and sm the @xmath10 level locates far below the fermi level.@xcite    in the valence band spectra of rare earth ditelluride , one can see that there is a slight change in the te @xmath2 band depending on rare earth elements .",
    "interestingly enough , the spectrum of late@xmath0 shows a very low carrier density at the fermi level indicative of a semiconducting character .",
    "this semiconduting character is also consistent with the satellite structures of the la @xmath1 core level .",
    "however , the semiconducting behavior contradicts the results of band calculations .",
    "the electronic structure of late@xmath0 was obtained using a tight - bind model@xcite , first principle calculations@xcite , and a precise one electron flapw method@xcite .",
    "unlike the experimental finding , all the band calculations agree that late@xmath0 is metallic with a majority contribution at the fermi level coming from the @xmath41 of te square sheet in the tetragonal @xmath42-plane .",
    "the spectra of sm and pr valence band have almost the same line shape and slightly broader bands than the la band . from the data ,",
    "we conclude that sm and pr samples are strongly metallic .",
    "the gd sample also shows a slightly metallic behavior with a relatively small fermi edge .",
    "we have presented the core level and valence band spectra of rete@xmath0 ( re = la , pr , sm , and gd ) , which have a strong two dimensional character .    in the x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) ,",
    "the @xmath1 core level spectra of rare earth elements in figure [ fig1 ] show that all the rare earth elements are trivalent . in the case of la @xmath1 core levels , main peaks and their satellites",
    "denoted as @xmath43 and @xmath44 are well described within the formulation of gunnarsson and schnhammer for the anderson impurity hamiltonian . according to our calculations ,",
    "the satellites arise from the hybridization of @xmath21 electrons with ligand te @xmath2 level .",
    "the @xmath1 structures of gd , pr , and sm are interpreted as arising from multiplet effects due to @xmath21 electrons in a photoemission process . in particular",
    ", the gd @xmath1 peaks are in good agreement with the calculated @xmath1 xps of @xmath45 ion corresponds to the @xmath46 electronic configuration .",
    "the slater s integrals for gd@xmath47 are calculated using a hartree- fock - slater program .    in the te @xmath1 core levels from the xps , we have not found any considerable change in the line - shape of the te  @xmath1 peaks depending on different rare earth elements within the resolution of our set - up . however , there is also an evidence of the two chemical phases of te .",
    "valence band spectra studied using ups show that there is a slight change in the te @xmath2 band depending on rare - earth elements .",
    "our data show that late@xmath0 has very low carrier density at the fermi level in contrast to the prediction of band calculations . on the other hand , sm and pr samples",
    "show strongly metallic band structure effects near the fermi level in our data .      to whom all correspondences",
