    "can the observed abundances of  be used to set bounds on the standard big bang nucleosynthesis models ( sbbn ) ?",
    "the issue has been a hot topic for many years , but the answer is still under debate . if the  abundance increases with time in the galaxy , then the lowest observed abundance of this isotope places a _ lower _ limit to the baryon  to  photon ratio @xmath1 ( see e.g. yang et al .  1984 ) .",
    "steigman & tosi ( 1992 ) , vangioni - flam , olive & prantzos  ( 1994 ) , and other authors have shown that , neglecting the stellar production of , the models of galactic chemical evolution of light isotopes can be safely used to infer the primordial abundances , and hence to test the sbbn predictions . on the other hand , starting from the classical papers by iben  ( 1967 ) and truran & cameron  ( 1971 ) , stellar models have always predicted that low ",
    "mass stars are strong producers of . when stellar production is included in models for the chemical evolution of the galaxy , no agreement between observed and predicted  abundances can be found ( rood , steigman & tinsley 1976 ; and , more recently , galli et al .",
    "1995 , olive et al .",
    "1995 , dearborn , steigman & tosi  1996 , hereafter dst , fields  1996 , prantzos  1996 ) .",
    "thus , the usefulness of the helium isotope as a `` cosmological baryometer '' remains highly questionable .",
    "the strongest piece of evidence in favor of  production in stars comes from the observation of this isotope in galactic planetary nebulae ( pns ) .",
    "the first detection of  in a pn ( ncg  3242 , by rood , bania , & wilson  1992 ) confirmed the theoretical prediction that low  mass stars are net producers of .",
    "the derived abundance ( /h @xmath2 ) was found to be in good quantitative agreement with the predicted values for stars of about one solar mass .",
    "subsequently , the  has been searched for in other pns , and detected in two other nebulae whose abundances are similar to that of ngc  3242 ( see rood et al .",
    "1995 , hereafter rbwb , for an updated review ) .",
    "the abundance of  in pns is much higher than that measured in the solar system and in the interstellar medium ( ism ) by one to two orders of magnitude .",
    "this evidence is the heart of the so - called `` -problem '' .",
    "indeed , observations toward a sample of galactic regions ( balser et al .",
    "1994 ) and the very recent measurements by the ulysses spacecraft in the local interstellar cloud ( gloeckler & geiss  1996 ) indicate a value of /h @xmath3 .",
    "it appears that the ism , today as well as at the time of the formation of the sun , has not been contaminated by the high fractional abundances of  observed in the pns studied by rbwb .",
    "since chemical abundances in pns are expected to represent the yields of low  mass stars , the question is whether the rbwb sample consists of an exception rather than a rule in the evolution of low  mass stars .    in view of the importance of this argument",
    ", we have critically analyzed the problem in the sense of determining reliably the masses of the pn progenitors in the rbwb sample , to check the observed  abundance to mass correlation against the stellar models .",
    "the basic knowledge of low  mass stellar evolution and of plasma diagnostics allow us to tackle this basic problem in a quantitative way .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following : after a short review of the most recent attempts to solve the  problem at a stellar level ( section  2 ) , we determine the progenitor masses of the rbwb sample by using up  to  date observed physical parameters of pns ( section  3 ) . in section  4",
    "we discuss the main steps for the calculations of the  abundances and we compare the resulting values with the theoretical predictions of stellar models . finally , in section  5 we examine the statistical significance of the presently available measurements in pns in the context of detailed models of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "in an influential paper , hogan  ( 1995 ) established a relation between the hypothetical mechanism responsible for the destruction of  in stellar envelopes , and the observed anomalies of the carbon isotopic ratio ( ) in a number of evolved stars .",
    "in fact , in some stars ( field giants , stars in galactic clusters )  falls below the predictions of adequate standard models , but only so for masses below @xmath5  ( charbonnel  1994 , fig .  6 ) .",
    "these anomalously low ratios can be accounted for by an extra - mixing process occurring after the completion of the first dredge - up , and before the end of the red giant branch ( rgb ) phase .",
    "it is reasonable to think that this process , when present , would drastically alter the post - dredge - up envelope abundance of other fragile isotopes , including .",
    "following this suggestion , charbonnel  ( 1994 , 1995 ) found that stellar models of 0.8 and 1  with extra - mixing nicely reproduce the low  ratios in giant stars , the variation of lithium abundance observed in pop .",
    "ii evolved stars , and show a considerable destruction of the envelope  abundance . however , this mechanism can operate efficiently only in stars of mass up to @xmath5  .",
    "the reason is that the occurrence of the mixing process corresponds to the encounter between the advancing hydrogen - burning shell and the discontinuity in chemical composition left beyond by the convective envelope during the dredge - up phase . as mixing",
    "can not penetrate in a region of strong molecular gradient , only after this evolutionary point , and only for those stars where it can actually happen , trace elements in the envelope ( e.g. ) can be transported down to the hydrogen burning zone and , vice versa , freshly produced elements ( e.g. @xmath6c ) can be mixed in the convective region up to the stellar surface . for stars more massive than 2",
    "the hydrogen - burning shell never reaches the chemically homogeneous region .",
    "wasserburg , boothroyd & sackmann  ( 1995 ) provided additional support to the extra - mixing hypothesis by computing a set of stellar models for rgb and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars undergoing cool bottom processing ( cbp ) , in which an ad hoc mixing mechanism transports stellar fluid elements from the cool bottom of the convective envelope down to some inner layer hot enough for nuclear processing , and vice versa .",
    "the model results reproduce the anomalous  observed in low  mass rgb stars and , at the same time , show a large destruction of envelope  ( by a factor @xmath7 in a 1  star ) .",
    "the same process can also resolve the puzzling low  ratios observed in agb stars ( see also sackmann & boothroyd  1996 and boothroyd & malaney  1996 ) .",
    "similar results have been obtained by denissenkov & weiss  ( 1996 ) and weiss , wagenhuber & denissenkov  ( 1996 ) , who model deep mixing as a diffusion process and show that a number of observed surface abondance correlations can be quantitatively reproduced , although with slightly different sets of mixing parameters in each case .    in conclusion ,",
    "non - standard mixing on rgb and/or agb phases offers an attractive scenario whose basic features can be summarized as follows : ( _ i _ ) contrary to the standard view , stars of mass less than 2  destroy  during their post - ms evolution and return depleted material to the ism , consistently with the abundance of measured in the pre - solar material , in galactic regions , and in the local ism ; ( _ ii _ ) the  ratios measured in the envelopes of giants less massive than 2  , the  ratios in the envelopes of agb stars of the same mass range , and the lithium abundances in metal - poor giants can be quantitatively reproduced ; ( _ iii _ ) high abundances of  are allowed in those pns whose progenitor mass is larger than 2  or did not otherwise undergo extra  mixing .",
    "thus , the  puzzle is solved at a _ stellar _ level .    the question to address",
    "now is then : do the pns with known  abundance comply with the scenario outlined above ?",
    "the answer can only come from an analysis of the mass of their progenitor stars .",
    "central stars ( css ) of pns are the relics of the agb stars that have gone through the instability driven ejection of the envelope , after the thermal pulse phase .",
    "the progenitor mass is then the stellar remnant mass plus the mass ejected during post  main sequence ( post  ms ) evolution .",
    "the direct measure of the ejected mass is not possible , and the study of the cs is not always very straightforward , given that the star is hidden by the surrounding nebula .",
    "we determine the progenitor masses through the following observational and interpretative steps :    ( _ i _ ) we firstly derive the cs s zanstra temperature , with the method described in kaler  ( 1983 ) .",
    "when assuming that this value is a good approximation of the effective temperature , we make two basic assumptions : the strongest one is that we assimilate the stellar output to a black  body spectrum , the weakest one is to assume that the nebula is thick to the he i  ionizing radiation . in order to calculate zanstra temperatures we need the values of the h@xmath8 and the ( @xmath94686 ) fluxes , corrected for the atmospheric extinction .",
    "also needed are the angular diameters .",
    "we take these basic parameters from the catalog of cahn , kaler & stanghellini ( 1992 , hereafter cks ) , which represents the most complete and recent compilation of these pn data .",
    "we then use the @xmath10 and @xmath11 magnitudes as quoted in acker et al .",
    "( 1992 , hereafter a92 ) , and , where possible , we use averages of the zanstra temperature derived from the @xmath11 and @xmath10 magnitudes , to minimize the errors on the data sets .",
    "( _ ii _ ) to proceed in our analysis , we need an estimate of the distances to the pns .",
    "the first approach is to use statistical distance from cks .",
    "these distances have been derived with the assumption that the ionized mass of pns is the same for all optically thin pns , and is a function of the surface brightness for optically thick pns .",
    "these are obviously strong assumptions and result in large distance errors , although the cks distances are considered among the most reliable statistical distances in the literature , given the very careful calibration ( see terzian  1993 ) . if other ( non  statistical ) distances are available , we take them into account . the stellar luminosity is then evaluated from the temperature and the most reliable distance available .    ( _ iii _ ) the derivation of the stellar mass from the observed luminosity and temperature is obtained by placing the star on the @xmath12  diagram ( see figure  1 ) , and read off the mass by comparing its position with the synthetic evolutionary tracks ( stanghellini & renzini  1993 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that these tracks have been calculated for h - burning cs , while there are indications that some pn nuclei are h - depleted , thus their energy is supplied by he  burning ( see a recent review in stanghellini 1995 ) . for he  burning stars , the tracks would have similar shapes on the @xmath13  diagram to those of h  burning stars , and the mass derivation should not be very different . the only possible caveat concerns stars that burn hydrogen at the agb , then the h - burning ceases and they switch to helium  burning . only in this very special case",
    "the track on the @xmath12  diagram experiences a blue loop , thus the luminosity at a given mass , and for each value of the effective temperature , is not exactly the same than that of h  burning stars .",
    "since the evolutionary timescales of these blue loops are quite short in comparison with the overall post  agb evolution , we conclude that our mass determination based on the usual h ",
    "burning tracks is reliable .",
    "( _ iv _ ) in order to calculate ms masses from the cs masses discussed above , we use the empirical initial mass  final mass relation derived by weidemann ( 1987 ) from observation of field white dwarfs .",
    "given that this method is not model  dependent , we prefer this approach instead of using models of post  agb evolution for our calculations .    in the following sections we illustrate the post  agb and progenitor mass derivation of the rbwb sample pns .",
    "in table 1 we list the usual pn name , the size in arcsec , the statistical and individual distances in kpc , the zanstra temperature , the luminosity , the cs mass , the progenitor mass calculated with the statistical ( index [ s ] ) , and the individual distance ( index [ i ] ) . the best mass and distance determinations are in boldface .",
    "table  1 clearly shows that the pns of the sample have masses lower than @xmath5  , ngc  6720 being a marginal case .",
    "in such a range , the proposed extra - mixing mechanism , active prior to the pn ejection , should have effectively destroyed all the .",
    "ic  289 is an irregular multiple shell pn ( chu , jacoby & arendt  1987 ) whose cs magnitudes are known in terms of lower limits only ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , shaw & kaler 1985 ) . by using these lower limits , we produce upper limits to the zanstra temperature and luminosity .",
    "the statistical distance is @xmath16  kpc ( cks ) , and the individual distance is @xmath17  kpc ( kaler & lutz  1985 ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath18 , and @xmath19 by using the statistical distance , and @xmath20 with the individual distance .",
    "the errors associated with the zanstra analysis depend on the intrinsic observing uncertainties of the individual measurements . by placing the cs of ic  289 on the @xmath13  diagram",
    "we obtain ( s ) @xmath21  or ( i ) @xmath22  depending on the distance scale used .",
    "we should use the statistical distance as a prime indicator , since the wind distances can be overestimated ( kaler 1991 , priv .",
    "the empirical initial mass - final mass relation yields @xmath23  , if the cs mass is calculated with the statistical distance .",
    "the physical parameters of this multiple shell , attached halo pn have been extensively discussed in stanghellini & pasquali  ( 1995 ) .",
    "we thus will not repeat here the analysis that has been performed to obtain the post  agb mass ( = 0.56  with @xmath24  kpc ) . the ms mass , calculated through the empirical initial mass  final mass relation , is @xmath250.2 )  .",
    "the individual distances available for this nebula , quoted in a92 , show a large spread ( @xmath26  kpc ) , and we do not use them in our calculations .",
    "recently , an expansion distance measured with radio observations ( hajian , phillips & terzian  1995 ) places this pn at @xmath27  kpc . the stellar luminosity at this distance will drop down to @xmath28 , and the corresponding post - agb mass would lie out of the permitted range .",
    "this h - rich wr nucleus ( mendz  1991 ) has well - determined magnitudes ( a92 ) .",
    "the and h@xmath8 fluxes are from a92 , while the angular diameter is quoted in cks .",
    "we obtain @xmath29 and @xmath30 with cks statistical distance .",
    "the only non - statistical distance available to ngc  6543 is the wind distance by kaler & lutz  ( 1985 ) , which is very close to the the statistical distance .",
    "other values of  found in the literature are within 10  % of our value ( see e.g. bianchi , recillas & grewing  1989 , perinotto  1993 , castor et al .  1981 ) . the position on the hr diagram yields a cs mass of @xmath31  , which , compared to the initial mass  final mass empirical relation ( weidemann  1987 ) gives @xmath32  .",
    "ngc  6720 also hosts a h - rich nucleus ( mendz  1991 ) .",
    "its statistical distance is @xmath33  kpc ( cks ) , and the measured expansion distance is 0.5  kpc ( pottasch  1980 ) . by using the fluxes and angular dimension of cks and the magnitudes quoted in a92 , we find @xmath34 and = 2.858 @xmath35 , which translates into a mass of @xmath36  .",
    "if we use the expansion distance we obtain @xmath37 , which pushes the stellar mass up to 0.69  .",
    "this second value is also in agreement with the derivation of @xmath38 determined by pier et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , although this last result is quite fragile .",
    "the statistical distance is in agreement with that found by napiwotzki & schnberner  ( 1995 ) , @xmath39  kpc .",
    "very recently , manchado et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have found that this nebula has a second , attached shell . if we were to use this second diameter to calculate the statistical distance _  la _ cks , we would have obtained @xmath40  kpc . in conclusion , it is difficult to decide which is the best guess for the distance .",
    "we calculate the mass of the progenitor to be @xmath41  and @xmath42  , respectively , but it is clear that more accurate measurements ( e.g. with radio expansion velocity ) are needed for this object .      another hydrogen  rich nucleus ( o(h ) , mendz  1991 ) .",
    "the fact that several pns of our sample have h  rich nuclei is important in that their mass determination from the h - burning post  agb tracks are very reliable .",
    "its distance measure is controversial : while the statistical distance places it at 1.2  kpc ( cks ) , the individual distance values quoted in a92 ( except the wind and the model - dependent measurements ) average to about half of this value .",
    "we calculate  via zanstra analysis by using the fluxes and dimensions of cks , and find @xmath43 ; by using the statistical distance we obtain @xmath44 .",
    "the effective temperature is well in agreement with other values found in the literature ( pottasch  1993 , heap  1993 , perinotto  1993 ) .",
    "if we were to calculate the luminosity with @xmath45  kpc we would have found @xmath46 .",
    "the first value gives a mass of @xmath47  , while the other calculated luminosity is too low to allow a mass determination .",
    "other authors find slightly higher values for the mass ( e.g. @xmath48 , heap  1993 ) .",
    "the larger distance is supported also by a very recent work by maciel  ( 1995 ) , who quotes @xmath49  kpc derived via uv and radio kinematics . for the progenitor mass",
    "we obtain @xmath50  ; a progenitor mass can not be given for @xmath40  kpc .",
    "the magnitude determinations for this cs are rather poor ( a92 ) .",
    "we calculate the effective temperature and luminosity using the fluxes and dimensions of cks .",
    "we find @xmath51 and @xmath52 by using the statistical distance ( cks ) , and @xmath53 with the averaged individual distance ( a92 ) . as a result , ( s )",
    "@xmath54  , or ( i ) @xmath55  with similar uncertainties . with our mass determination",
    "we find @xmath56  and @xmath57  , respectively .",
    "recently , hajian & terzian  ( 1996 ) find a radio expansion distance of @xmath58  kpc , in good agreement with the value used here ( @xmath59  kpc ) and within the range of the statistical distance given by cks .",
    "in conclusion , we calculate the progenitor mass using @xmath59  kpc .",
    "in order to derive the  abundance we model pns as homogeneous spheres of fully ionized gas . we compute the abundance of  in pns from the line parameters given by rbwb and from our analysis of the pns physical parameters .      the   column density in pns can be obtained from observations of the hyperfine structure line of  at @xmath61  ghz : @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65  s@xmath66 ( gould  1994 ) , and @xmath67 is the brightness temperature profile of the line . for a gaussian line profile , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is",

    "the electronic densities are derived from forbidden line intensities ( stanghellini & kaler  1989 ) .",
    "the values shown are the averages of the mean values for each density indicator .",
    "no forbidden line data being available for ic  289 , we have computed its electronic density from the radio flux at 5  ghz with the help of the formula given by gathier  ( 1987 ) : @xmath91^{1/2}\\;{\\rm cm}^{-3 } , \\eqno(6)\\ ] ] where we have taken @xmath92  mjy ( higgs  1971 ) , the electron temperature @xmath93  k from cks , the average @xmath74 from table  1 , and a filling factor @xmath94 .",
    "we estimate an uncertainty of 10  % on the resulting values of @xmath95 .    the  line parameters from rbwb and our derived abundances are listed in the last four columns of table  2 .",
    "given the distance and the line parameters , the resulting range of abundances reflects mainly the uncertainty in the angular radius of the source ( see eq .  [ 5 ] ) , which we have allowed to vary between the minimun and maximum inner radius of the nebula as given by chu et al .",
    "our results agree with those of rbwb .",
    "the only exception is for ic  289 , for which rbwb obtain a value of @xmath96 , outside our range .",

    ", all pns with measured abundance are fully consistent with the theoretical predictions .    in figure  2",
    "we also show the expected  abundance in the case of non - standard mixing .",
    "the most extensive calculations are those of boothroyd  ( 1996 ) , while hogan  ( 1995 ) only gives a crude estimate of the equilibrium abundance independent of mass .",
    "the detailed calculations indicate that the mass dependence of the destruction of  is quite strong , and the resulting abundance decreases sharply for masses below @xmath97  .",
    "the comparison with the observed pns clearly shows that these stars have not suffered any depletion .",
    "even for the most massive progenitor ( ngc  6720 ) , for which the difference between the two cases is smaller , the observed abundance is still a factor @xmath5 above the non - standard curve . we thus conclude that the current observations do not support the conjecture of enhanced  depletion in all low  mass stars .",
    "as discussed in section 1 , chemical evolution models adopting standard @xmath4he stellar nucleosynthesis overproduce @xmath4he . in particular , all the galactic models in better agreement with the observational constraints predict @xmath4he abundances largely inconsistent with those observed in the solar system and in the ism ( locally and at different galactic radii ) , unless they adopt alternative nucleosyntheses with strongly reduced @xmath4he contribution from low and intermediate mass stars of the kind described in section 2 ( see tosi  1996 and references therein ) .",
    "on the other hand , if all stars with @xmath100  were to deplete their envelope @xmath4he down to a mass fraction @xmath101 , no pn would be able to show abundances 100 times larger as those observed by rbwb . by the same argument , the possibility of a nuclear physics solution to the  problem proposed by galli et al .",

    ", we have recomputed some of the numerical models discussed by dst .",

    "based on tosi s ( 1996 ) comparison of the best chemical evolution models currently available in the literature , here we adopt @xmath104 and @xmath105 as the primordial abundances by mass of deuterium and @xmath4he , respectively .    for the cases with standard stellar nucleosynthesis we have adopted dst s yields ; for the cases with @xmath4he depletion induced by extra - mixing we",
    "have alternatively adopted either boothroyd s ( 1996 ) detailed values as function of stellar mass , or simply taken the equilibrium value /h=1@xmath106 for @xmath107  as in hogan s ( 1995 ) suggestion .",
    "let us define @xmath108 as the percentage of stars with @xmath100  experiencing extra  mixing and therefore depleting @xmath4he ; the remaining @xmath109 fraction of stars have standard @xmath4he yields .",

    "the vertical bars correspond to the 2-@xmath112 ranges of values derived from observations of the solar system and the local ism ( geiss 1993 and gloeckler & geiss 1996 , respectively ) .",
    "it is apparent that only with @xmath113 0.7 can the models fit the observed ranges .",
    "the long - dashed curve in the figure shows the effect of assuming @xmath114 and hogan s depletion . since the latter is more drastic than boothroyd s , the percentage of depleting stars required to obtain the same agreement with the data is smaller , but the results are qualitatively the same .",
    "figure  4 shows the @xmath4he / h radial distributions resulting at the present epoch from the models shown in figure  3 .",
    "also shown are the abundances derived by rbwb from region radio observations ( dots with their error bars ) and by gloeckler & geiss  ( 1996 ) from ulysses data on local ism ( vertical bar for the 2-@xmath112 range ) . to get a radial distribution flat and low enough to fit the data , @xmath108 values larger than 0.7 must be invoked , in agreement with the results obtained for the local evolution .",
    "we thus suggest that to solve the  problem in terms of extra mixing in low and intermediate mass stars , the vast majority of them must be affected by this phenomenon . in this framework , the few pns observed by rbwb and showing large  content must have been selected in the , relatively small , sample of stars without deep mixing .",
    "indeed , the selection criteria for the target pns ( rood 1996 , priv . comm . ) were aimed at maximizing the likelihood of detecting the  line : ( _ i _ ) located at least 500 pc above the galactic plane ; ( _ ii _ ) medium excitation pns ; ( _ iii _ ) pns with low nitrogen and @xmath6c to avoid objects where mixing could have destroyed .",
    "the latter criterion suggests that the possibility that 70 - 80% of low  mass stars deplete  and the remaning 30 - 20% do not is a viable solution to the  problem .",
    "we have analyzed the sample of pns with measured  abundance in order to determine the mass of the progenitor stars .",
    "we found that all pns have masses below @xmath97  , and their observed abundances are in agreement with the predictions of standard nucleosynthesis in low  mass stars . unless the pn sample of rbwb is confirmed to be highly biased in favour of non - depleting stars , these results would pose severe problems to the non - standard destruction mechanisms recently suggested in order to overcome the long - standing problem of  overproduction on the galactic timescale .    by using models of galactic evolution of  with standard and non - standard nucleosynthesis prescriptions",
    ", we have found that the resulting evolution of  can be consistent with the values determined in the pre - solar material and in the local ism only if more than 7080  % of the whole population of stars with mass below @xmath115  has undergone enhanced  depletion .",
    "this implies that either the sample of pns studied here is not representative of the low  mass stellar population , or the solution to the  problem lies elsewhere . as for the former possibility",
    ", a crucial observational test would be the simultaneous determination of the  abundance and the  ratio in a large sample of pns .",
    "in fact , in addition to the  depletion , extra - mixing during the agb phase would also decrease the  ratio from to the standard value of @xmath116 to @xmath117 ( see e.g. sackmann & boothroyd  1996 ) .",
    "such small values have been observed in few pns ( bachiller et al .",
    "1996 ) , although for the only pn ( ngc  6720 ) of known  abundance the  is consistent with standard predictions . extending this kind of observations to a statistically significant number of pns",
    "will shed new light on the long standing problem of .",
    "given the size and the selection criteria mentioned in the previous section , the rbwb sample of pns is too small and selective to draw firm conclusions about the generality of the depletion processes taking place in the latest stages of stellar evolution .",
    "observations of the same kind , but on a much larger sample , including also _ depleting candidates _ , i.e. pns with high nitrogen and  are necessary to finally understand both the late evolutionary phases of low  mass stars and the galactic evolution of an important cosmological baryometer like .",
