    "fuzzy models have been proposed , @xcite-@xcite , as a potential method of doing `` lattice '' field theory .",
    "the basic idea is to take a classical phase space of finite volume , quantize it and thus obtain a space with a finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "things are of course a little more complicated but essentially this idea works when the phase space is a co - adjoint orbit , the simplest such example being the two sphere @xmath1 , with the resulting quantized space known as the fuzzy sphere @xcite . field theory models on the fuzzy sphere then possess only a finite number of modes .",
    "the simplest field theory model of a scalar field with @xmath0 interaction was proposed in @xcite and has proved to be an excellent testing ground for the idea of using fuzzy spaces for doing ` lattice ' studies .    a potential problem with using these fuzzy spaces to get a finite approximation to field theories and",
    "thus do ` lattice ' physics has emerged due to the phenomenon of uv / ir mixing @xcite .",
    "the problem was discussed in the moyal plane in @xcite where the fields possess an infinite number of modes , and consequently a regularization procedure is needed .",
    "this phenomenon appears to be generic for field theories in non - commutative spaces .    in a recent article vaidya",
    "@xcite pointed out that this uv / ir mixing phenomenon is present in the @xmath0 model of @xcite on the fuzzy sphere .",
    "his work was followed by that of chu , madore and steinacker,@xcite , who calculated explicitly the one - loop contribution to the two point vertex function and found that in the commutative limit , the non - planar diagram retains a residual finite contribution over and above the expected commutative term .",
    "the additional term , can be seen as a nonlocal rotationally invariant contribution to the effective action . though this term is non - singular for the fuzzy sphere they showed that in the planar limit it incorporates the uv / ir mixing singularity of the moyal plane .",
    "the implications of this result are very serious for the program of using the matrix model approximations to continuum field theories to study the non - perturbative continuum behaviour .",
    "one implication is that the scalar action considered by these authors can not be the correct fuzzy action for the ` lattice ' program outlined above .",
    "we therefore return to the problem and study how serious it in fact is and whether it has a natural solution .",
    "we find that indeed it has a quite natural solution and that the problem disappears when the interaction term in the matrix action is `` normal ordered '' , i.e. when the appropriate subtractions associated with wick contractions of the @xmath0 term are included in the action .",
    "the action ( [ normalorderedaction ] ) with normal ordered vertex is therefore the correct starting point for the fuzzy lattice physics program .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we begin by briefly reviewing the @xmath2-product , that realizes matrix multiplication at the level of functions on the fuzzy sphere .",
    "we then review the one - loop calculation of the two - point function , repeating the calculation using the @xmath2-product .",
    "next we discuss the 4-point vertex functions and demonstrate that the problem anomalous contributions in that commutative limit does not arise here .",
    "we further show , in fact , that this problem is localized to the case of a propagator returning to the same vertex that it leaves , i.e. that it is associated with tadpole diagrams .",
    "we finally propose our solution for the elimination of these unwanted contributions  normal ordering the @xmath0 vertex .",
    "the article concludes with a discussion and conclusions where we define the matrix model which has as limiting theory the standard continuum model .",
    "at the level of the fundamental representation the fuzzy sphere @xcite can be defined as the orbit the adjoint action of @xmath3 on a rank one projection operator , @xmath4 , in a 2-dimensional hilbert space , @xcite @xcite , with @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . at a point on the sphere parameterized by the unit vector @xmath8 in @xmath9 , obtained by rotating the north pole by @xmath10",

    "it was pointed out in @xcite and @xcite that there is a subtlety in the one - loop correction to the two - point function for this theory . for the commutative theory",
    "the only infinities arise in the tadpole diagram and are accounted for by a mass renormalization , but the fuzzy model ( or fuzzy regularization ) introduces new momentum dependent terms into the effective action even at one - loop .",

    "so one might expect that @xmath85 would be of order @xmath86 and hence vanish as @xmath67 .",

    "the last term is the additional , manifestly positive , noncommutative subtraction that is necessary to obtain the correct commutative limit . a more transparent form of this new action is given by @xmath163={4\\pi\\over ( l+1)}{\\hbox{tr}}\\left\\{{1\\over 2}\\phi\\left(\\hat{{{\\cal l}}}^2-{\\lambda\\over 2}{\\cal q}_l(\\hat{{{\\cal l}}}^2 ) + t-{\\lambda\\over 2}{\\hbox{$\\bigcirc\\kern-3.6pt{\\bf\\bullet}$\\kern 1.3pt}}(l , t)\\right)\\phi + { \\lambda\\over 4!}\\phi^4\\right\\ } , \\label{normalorderedaction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath165 $ ]",
    ", @xmath125 is defined in ( [ calq_defn ] ) and @xmath166 in ( [ commutative_tadpole ] ) .",
    "note that the first terms can be interpreted as a momentum dependent wavefunction renormalization since @xmath167 is a power series in @xmath168 which starts at order @xmath168 and therefore we could have written @xmath169    this theory , ( [ normalorderedaction ] ) , is therefore the correct matrix model that represents a lattice regularization of commutative theory .",
    "note that we have further replaced the parameter @xmath60 with @xmath170 , as the two are different . in a purely commutative theory",
    "the replacement @xmath171 establishes the relationship between the two parameters .",
    "this can be iterated to generate all tadpole contributions .",
    "the new quadratic terms exactly cancel all the unwanted momentum dependent quadratic terms in the effective action arising from non - planar diagrams in the non - commutative theory and the continuum limit of this theory is the standard @xmath0 theory in 2 dimensions .",
    "curiously , for this new model the direct large @xmath16 limit of the action does not give the commutative action but rather gives a non - local action .",
    "however this non - locality is precisely what is need for the full quantum field theory to reproduce the commutative limit .    for a complex scalar field on the fuzzy sphere",
    "there are two potential vertices : @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "the first has only a planar tadpole and so will have no anomalous contribution , however the second has a non - planar and therefore anomalous tadpole . again",
    "the normal ordering prescription removes the unwanted contribution .",
    "in fact for any two dimensional @xmath0 model with global @xmath174 symmetry normal ordering the vertex will guarantee the commutative limit is recovered .",
    "we have here only established the correct model for the two dimensional case . a case that warrants further attention",
    "is that of @xmath0 for a four dimensional fuzzy space .",
    "the simplest example is to take the case @xmath175 . in this case",
    "it is easily seen from the above techniques that the problems are more severe and that there are additional residual non - local differences for the two and four - point functions .",
    "this is due to the divergences that appear in the commutative limit .",
    "it therefore appears to be difficult to establish precisely what fuzzy model will reproduce the commutative limit .",
    "we leave this question open for the moment but hope to return to it in the near future .    as a final comment we observe that the normal ordering prescription proposed here removes the uv / ir mixing problems for the two dimensional @xmath0 model on the moyal plane .",
    "this is readily seen since the this latter model can be recovered as a particular scaling limit of the model considered here @xcite .    *",
