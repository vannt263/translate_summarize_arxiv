    "searches at the atlas and cms experiments at the lhc show no signs of physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) .",
    "after the first phase of lhc operation at centre - of - mass energies of 78  tev in 20102012 , the limits for the masses of supersymmetric particles , in particular of 1st/2nd generation squarks and gluinos , have been pushed well into the tev range  @xcite .",
    "likewise , precision measurements in the flavor sector , in particular in @xmath4-physics , are well consistent with standard model ( sm ) expectations  @xcite and show no sign , or need , of new physics . at the same time the recent discovery  @xcite of a higgs - like particle with mass around 125  gev makes the question of stability of the electroweak scale  the infamous gauge hierarchy problem  even more imminent .",
    "indeed , supersymmetry ( susy ) is arguably the best - motivated theory to solve the gauge hierarchy problem and to explain a light sm - like higgs boson .",
    "so , the higgs has very likely been discovered  but where is supersymmetry ?",
    "looking closely @xcite one soon realizes that many of the current limits on susy particles are based on severe model assumptions , which impose particular relations between particle masses , decay branching ratios , _ etc_. the prime example is the interpretation of the search results within the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm ) .",
    "the interpretation of the search results within a much more general realization of the mssm is perfectly feasible , see @xcite , but computationally very demanding and certainly not suitable for a `` quick '' survey .",
    "an approach which has therefore been adopted systematically by the atlas and cms collaborations , is to interpret the results within so - called simplified model spectra @xcite .",
    "simplified model spectra , or sms for short , are effective - lagrangian descriptions involving just a small number of new particles .",
    "they were designed as a useful tool for the characterization of new physics , see  @xcite .",
    "a large variety of results on searches in many different channels are available from both atlas and cms , providing general cross section limits for sms topologies . however",
    ", using these results to constrain complex susy ( or general bsm ) scenarios is not straightforward .    in this paper , we present a method to decompose the signal of an arbitrary susy spectrum into simplified model topologies and test it against all the existing lhc bounds in the sms context .",
    "the computer package doing all this is dubbed smodels  @xcite .",
    "( a similar approach was in fact proposed some time ago in @xcite . )",
    "as we will show , this decomposition allows a vast survey of susy models , and enormously simplifies the task of identifying the regions of parameter space which are still allowed by the current searches .",
    "our method also allows us to discuss the current coverage of the simplified models considered so far by the atlas and cms searches .",
    "we can , for instance , identify possible regions of parameter space which are not tested by any of the simplified models assumed by the current searches .",
    "two scans of the mssm with parameters defined at the weak scale , one with 7 and one with 9 free parameters , are used as show - case examples to demonstrate the use of our method .",
    "our results show that the sms interpretation of the lhc results indeed provide important constraints on susy scenarios . at the same time",
    ", however , large regions of interesting parameter space with susy particles below 1  tev remain unchallenged by the current sms results .",
    "it is important to note that , while our method was originally developed with susy searches in mind , and the application presented here focusses on the mssm , our approach is perfectly general and easily extendible to any bsm model to which the experimental sms results apply .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : overview ]",
    "we briefly describe the general procedure for the decomposition and the use of the experimental results .",
    "a more detailed description is given in section  [ sec : details ] ; readers who are not interested in technicalities may skip this section altogether .",
    "section  [ sec : validation ] discusses the validation of the smodels framework . in section  [ sec : scan ] we then apply smodels in two scans of the mssm and discuss how the sms limits constrain various particle masses , and which regions of parameter space remain untested .",
    "conclusions and an outlook are given in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "currently most atlas and cms experimental analyses consider specific simplified models to present their constraints on new physics .",
    "the number of signal events expected in a given signal region is then obtained using the signal efficiency times acceptance for the specific model assumed . in general , the signal efficiency is model dependent and must be calculated for each specific model considered .",
    "nonetheless , most current experimental analyses aim for model independent constraints and consider sufficiently inclusive signal regions .",
    "the guiding principle behind the procedure discussed here is the assumption that the signal efficiencies for most experimental searches for new physics depend mostly on the event kinematics and are just marginally affected by the specific details of the bsm model .",
    "this allows us to map the full model s signals to its sms - equivalent topologies and use the latter to constrain the full model .    clearly , this assumption , which from now on we call sms assumption , is not always valid .",
    "for instance , it is expected to be violated for searches which strongly rely on shape distributions .",
    "the signal efficiencies can moreover depend on spin correlations , or on properties of off - shell states in production channels ( s - channel or t - channel production ) or in decays .",
    "a quantitative discussion of the sensitivity of signal efficiencies to various model properties is analysis dependent and a complicated matter , being out of the scope of the current work .",
    "dedicated studies will be presented in future publications . generally , it is the responsibility of the user to apply smodels only to models and experimental results for which the sms assumption is approximately valid .",
    "( note that it is possible to use only a subset of experimental results in the database . )",
    "let us now outline the general smodels procedure .    under the sms assumption , to a first approximation",
    ", it is possible to reduce all the properties of a bsm model to its mass spectrum , production cross sections ( @xmath5 ) and decay branching ratios ( @xmath6 ) . with this knowledge",
    "we can decompose the full bsm signal in a series of independent signal topologies with their specific weights given by the corresponding production cross section times branching ratio ( ) . such a decomposition is extremely helpful to cast the theoretical predictions of a specific bsm model in a model - independent framework , which can then be compared against the experimental limit on this . a schematic view of the working principle is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] .     schematic view of the working principle of smodels.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    the first step in our procedure is to compute all signal topologies appearing in the full model and their respective weights , @xmath7 .",
    "since here we only consider models with a @xmath0 symmetry ( such as r - parity , t - parity or kk - parity ) , the possible signal topologies will always arise from pair production of new @xmath0-odd particles , which decay as @xmath8 particles , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the parent and daughter bsm particles , respectively .",
    "even , such as heavy higgs bosons in the mssm .",
    "the light mssm higgs @xmath11 is treated as a sm particle .",
    "] hence all topologies will be of the form represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : gensmstop ] , which shows the production of the initial pair of bsm states ( represented by a circle with two outgoing legs ) and their subsequent cascade decays . in our notation",
    "all particles appearing in the sms topology , both @xmath0-even and @xmath0-odd , are on - shell .",
    "the case of off - shell decays is always included as 3-body decays , with no mention to the off - shell states .",
    "therefore all the relevant information ( in the sms framework ) of such a diagram can be reduced to three main objects :    * the diagram topology : number of vertices and sm final state particles in each vertex ; * the masses ( mass vector ) of the @xmath12-odd bsm particles appearing in the diagram ; * the diagram weight ( ) .",
    "the reduction of a particular process to its equivalent sms topology is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : smsexample ] .",
    "details of the decomposition procedure and the labeling scheme used are explained in section  [ sec : decomposition ] .",
    "note that once the decomposition is done , the full model is reduced to its signal topologies and there is no longer any reference to the specific details of the model , except for the relevant @xmath0-odd masses and the associated to each topology . in this way we can cast the theoretical predictions in a model - independent way .",
    "label the sm final state particles .",
    "the end of each decay chain is always the lightest @xmath0-odd particle which is stable . ]",
    "( 40,100)(10,20 ) ( 0,80)(1,0)30     +    the next and more involved step is to confront the theoretical predictions obtained from the decomposition with the experimental constraints . for",
    "that it is necessary to map the signal topologies produced in the decomposition to the sms topologies constrained by data .",
    "for some experimental analyses this is a trivial matter , since they provide an upper limit for a single topology cross section as a function of the relevant bsm mass vector .",
    "examples are constraints on squark pair production , with @xmath13 , which give an upper limit on as a function of @xmath14 , or gluino pair production , with @xmath15 , which limit as a function of @xmath16 .",
    "however it is often the case that the experimental analysis does not constrain a single topology but rather a sum of several topologies , assuming a specific relative contribution from each of them . as an example , consider the slepton pair production limits , where the interpretation constrains the sum over final state lepton flavors ( @xmath17 s and @xmath18 s ) under the assumption that each flavor contributes 50% to the signal and that selectrons and smuons are mass degenerate , @xmath19 . in order to apply this experimental constraint to the signal topologies obtained from the decomposition ,",
    "it is necessary to combine all topologies with a single lepton being emitted in each branch and which have the same mass vector .",
    "moreover , in order for the experimental constraint to be valid , it is necessary to verify the analysis conditions : topologies with @xmath17 s and @xmath18 s contribute equally to the final theoretical prediction ( ) .",
    "a more involved example are the constraints from tri - lepton+met searches : here the sms results for @xmath20 production with decays through sleptons assume the intermediate slepton being a selectron , smuon or stau ( including or not including sneutrinos ) so that the limits on only apply for specific flavor - democratic , tau - enriched , tau - dominated , etc .",
    "such constraints need to be carefully taken into account when mapping the signal topologies obtained from the decomposition to the experimental results .",
    "a detailed description of how the analyses assumptions and constraints are described in a model independent language is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : database ] .",
    "the procedure for matching the decomposition results to the analysis constraints is discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : interface ] .",
    "finally when all signal topologies are combined according to the assumptions of each experimental result , the resulting theoretical predictions for the cross sections of the combined topologies can be directly compared to the experimental upper limits . thus it can be decided whether a particular parameter point ( a particular bsm spectrum ) is excluded or not by the available sms results .",
    "in this section , we discuss the technical details of the main building blocks of smodels : the decomposition procedure , the analysis database , and the matching of theoretical and experimental results .      as explained in the previous section , under the sms assumption , all the complexity of the bsm model can be replaced by the knowledge of the signal topologies and their weights , together with the relevant bsm masses .",
    ", the sms assumption may be violated for specific analyses given a particular model .",
    "for instance , if the signal efficiency for a specific analysis is too sensitive to the shape of the signal distributions and these are strongly affected by the type of production channel ( s - channel or t - channel ) or by the nature of the off - shell states mediating the decays , the reduction of a full model to its sms topologies no longer encapsulates all the necessary information .",
    "we leave it to the user to evaluate which analyses may be applied for the input model considered . ]",
    "the topologies can then be classified according to the number of vertices in each branch and the sm states appearing in each vertex . in order to properly classify the signal topologies",
    ", we introduce a formal labeling scheme , which is _ i ) _ model independent , _ ii ) _ general enough to describe any topology , _ iii ) _ sufficiently concise and _ iv ) _ allows us to easily combine topologies according to the assumptions and conditions in the experimental analyses .",
    "we choose to use a labeling system based on nested brackets , which corresponds to a textual representation of the topology . as discussed in section  [ sec : overview ] , we assume that all signal topologies respect a @xmath0-symmetry , hence bsm states are produced in pairs and cascade decay to a single bsm state and sm particles .",
    "therefore a signal topology always contains two branches ( one for each of the initially pair produced bsm states ) , which we describe by @xmath21 $ ] . in each branch",
    "there is a series of vertices , which represent the cascade decays . from each vertex",
    "there is one outgoing bsm state and a number of outgoing sm particles .",
    "thus , inside each branch bracket , we add an inner bracket for each vertex , containing the lists of outgoing sm particles .",
    "note that there is no mention to the intermediate bsm particles ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , ... ) , which makes our method explicitly model independent . the only information kept from the bsm states are their masses . to illustrate the labeling scheme just defined",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : smslabel ] a signal topology containing a 2-step cascade decay in one branch and a one step decay in the other . following the above prescription",
    ", this topology is described by @xmath21 $ ] , with @xmath24,[\\mbox{particles in vertex 2}]]$ ] and @xmath25 $ ] , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : smslabel ] .",
    "note that the brackets inside each branch are ordered according to the vertex number .",
    "for the specific final sm particles assumed in the figure , we finally obtain : topology @xmath26,[\\nu]]\\;,\\;[[l^+,l^-]]\\;]$ ] . the corresponding mass vector , shown in parenthesis in fig .  [ fig : smslabel ] ,",
    "is given by @xmath27,[m_1,m_2]]$ ] , where once again the masses are ordered according to the vertices .",
    "note that we allow for the possibility of distinct final state masses in each branch ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "finally , adding the topology weight ( @xmath7 ) , we have a full description of the signal topology .",
    "given a bsm model described by its spectrum , branching ratios and production cross sections we need to obtain all the possible signal topologies and compute their weights ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the procedure of computing these corresponds to the decomposition of the full model in terms of simplified model topologies .",
    "there are two ways to actually perform the sms decomposition .",
    "the first requires the generation of parton - level monte carlo ( mc ) events , followed by the mapping of each event into the corresponding sms topology .",
    "the second method is purely based on the slha  @xcite spectrum file and decay table , supplemented by theoretically computed cross sections .",
    "below we describe both approaches in more detail .",
    "the decomposition based on parton level mc events is the most general one , since it can decompose any type of bsm model , as long as it is possible to simulate mc events for it . in this case",
    "an event file in the lhe format is used as input and each event is mapped to a simplified model topology .",
    "the mapping is obviously not one - to - one , since more than one event can generate the same exact sms topology",
    ". then the sum of mc weights for all events contributing to the same topology directly gives @xmath7 for the corresponding topology .",
    "the disadvantage of this method is the introduction of mc uncertainties in the decomposition result ; this can however be easily solved by increasing the mc statistics .",
    "we also note that the recent advances on nlo mc generators will allow to produce decomposition results at nlo even in the mc based decomposition .      in the susy case , there are a number of public codes for the computation of the mass spectrum and decay branching ratios with output in the slha  @xcite format .",
    "the production cross sections can then be computed at leading order ( lo ) through a monte carlo generator , or at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) with prospino  @xcite . for gluinos and squarks ,",
    "cross sections at next - to - leading log ( nll ) precision can be computed using nll - fast  @xcite .",
    "these cross sections can be included in the slha file  @xcite , which then holds all the required information for the sms decomposition .    in the slha - based decomposition",
    "the cross sections for pair production of bsm states and the corresponding branching ratios are used to generate all possible signal topologies .",
    "the only theoretical uncertainties in this case come from the cross - section uncertainty , hence being much smaller than the uncertainties in the mc - based method , which depends on the mc statistics . in order to avoid dealing with a large number of irrelevant signal topologies , only the ones with @xmath7 above a minimal cut value",
    "for the results presented below we take this cut value to be @xmath29  fb . may still be relevant for the final theoretical prediction .",
    "this is why we take such a small value for the minimal cross section cut . ]",
    "although the decomposition described here ( both for the mc and slha based methods ) is fairly straightforward , the model independent language introduced above can be used to perform non - trivial operations on the signal topologies .",
    "one possibility is the compression of topologies containing a series of invisible decays at the end of the cascade decay chain , as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : icompression](left ) . in this case",
    "the effective final state bsm momentum is given by the sum of the neutrinos and the final bsm state momenta .",
    "therefore , for the experimental analyses , this topology is equivalent to a compressed one , where the effective bsm final state includes the neutrino emissions , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : icompression](right ) . using",
    "the notation introduced previously , this compression simply corresponds to @xmath30,[x,[\\nu,\\nu],[\\nu ] ] ] \\rightarrow [ [ x'],[x]]$ ] , where @xmath31 represent the other cascade decay vertices . when performing this compression we",
    "must also remove the corresponding bsm masses from the mass vector , so the effective final state bsm mass becomes heavier .",
    "the compression procedure allows us to constrain the original topology using experimental constraints for @xmath32,[x']]$ ] .",
    "more importantly , such `` invisible compression '' can be automatically performed in a model - independent way using the nested bracket notation .     compressed equivalent ( right ) .",

    "this `` mass compression '' approximation is only reliable when the energy carried away by the sm particles emitted in the decay of quasi - degenerate states is negligible for all experimental purposes . if this is the case , the original topology is equivalent to a compressed one , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mcompression ] .",
    "for the results presented in section  [ sec : scan ] we perform the mass compression for quasi - degenerate states if their mass difference is below 5 gev . once again",
    ", this compression procedure allows us to constrain the original topology using experimental constraints for shorter cascade decays .",
    "we also point out that , whenever ( invisible and/or mass ) compressions are performed , care must be taken to avoid double counting topologies . if both the original and the compressed topologies are kept after the decomposition , they should not be combined later , since this would result in a double counting of the topology weight .",
    "the interpretation of the bsm search results in the context of simplified models has become the de - facto standard for the experimental collaborations .",
    "the atlas and cms collaborations typically produce two types of sms results : for each simplified model , values for the product of the experimental acceptance and efficiency ( @xmath36 ) are determined to translate a number of signal events after cuts into a signal cross section . from this information , a 95% confidence level upper limit ( ul ) on the product of the cross section and branching fraction ( ) is derived as a function of the bsm masses appearing in the sms . finally , assuming a theoretical `` reference '' cross section for each mass combination , an exclusion curve in the plane of two masses is produced .",

    "@xcite , results for distinct slepton mass values are also provided , which allows us to interpolate between them and apply these results to more generic models .",

    "the dashed lines correspond to @xmath228.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ] +    we now turn our attention to the points which have large cross sections ( light squark and/or gluino masses ) but none the less evade all current sms constraints . in fig .",
    "[ fig : resultsscan2allowall1 ] we show the allowed points on top of the excluded ones in the squark versus gluino mass plane .",
    "it is instructive to consider separately the bino and mixed lsp scenarios , so in the left panel we plot the points with mostly bino @xmath91 and wino @xmath89 ( @xmath229 ) , while in the right panel we show points with a mixed higgsino ",
    "bino lsp ( @xmath227 ) . in the @xmath229 case",
    "we see that gluino masses below @xmath230 gev are excluded for almost any choice of the parameters , in agreement with the results for * scan - i*. as already mentioned , because of the relation between @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , low gluino masses are also constrained by limits on @xmath231 .",
    "however for any higher values of @xmath121 there are several allowed points as long as @xmath232 and/or @xmath227 .",
    "the former case was already discussed in the previous section , since it is equivalent to the parameter space of * scan - i*. as mentioned , if gluino decays to squarks are kinematically forbidden , the @xmath233 decay often dominates , which is not constrained by the current sms results .",
    "furthermore , if squarks are heavier than gluinos , they predominatly decay to @xmath234 and these signal topologies are also not constrained by the current sms results .",
    "therefore points with @xmath232 and @xmath235 can always evade the sms constraints . on the other hand , if @xmath236 , squarks decay to ew - inos and",
    "the constraints on squark production can be applied . from the last plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : resultsscan2allowall1 ] we see that points with light squarks ( @xmath237 tev ) and @xmath236 are always excluded in the bino lsp scenario ( @xmath238 ) . once the lsp acquires a sizeable higgsino component , the @xmath214 decay becomes suppressed and the constraints are much weaker , resulting in several allowed points in the light squark / gluino region , shown in the right plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : resultsscan2allowall1 ] .",
    "we presented a new tool , smodels , to decompose the lhc signatures expected from bsm spectra presenting a @xmath0 symmetry into sms topologies and test the predicted cross sections ( ) for each topology against the existing 95% cl upper limits from atlas and cms .",
    "the program consists of three parts , the decomposition procedure , which can be monte - carlo based or slha based , the database of atlas and cms sms results , and the interface to match model predictions onto the experimental results .",
    "our concrete implementation currently focusses on susy searches with missing energy , for which a large variety of sms results from atlas and cms are available .",
    "smodels can be used `` out of the box '' for the mssm and its extensions , like the next - to - mssm .",
    "the approach is however perfectly general and easily extendible to any bsm model to which the experimental sms results apply .",
    "( of course , the sms assumption is subject to several caveats , as explained at the beginning of section  2 and in footnotes  3 and 4 . )    as a proof of principle , we applied our procedure in two scans of the weak - scale mssm and discussed which parameter regions are excluded by the sms limits and which scenarios remain untested . as we showed , smodels can be useful for several purposes .",
    "first of all it is a convenient tool for relatively fast surveys of complex parameter spaces in order to devise the regions that are definitely excluded by data .",
    "second , it can be used to find relevant topologies for which no sms results exists  this may be helpful for the experimental collaborations for designing new sms interpretations .",
    "an example that we already identified is `` mixed '' topologies with @xmath239 final states , which can arise  from @xmath240 or from @xmath221 pair production with one stop decaying into @xmath241 and the other one into @xmath242 .",
    "third , one may use the decomposition procedure of smodels independent of the results database in order to identify the most important signal topologies in regions of parameter space .",
    "finally , in the case of a positive bsm signal , the smodels framework may be helpful for characterizing which new physics scenarios may explain the observations .    while smodels is already a powerful and useful tool for phenomenological studies , there is of course still much room for improvement .",
    "for instance , as we have shown , scenarios with complicated decay patterns  as typical for  light gluinos and heavy squarks  are not well constrained with the current framework , which is based on testing the upper limits topology - by - topology without the possibility of combining results . here the use of efficiency maps , once available in a systematic fashion , would allow for significant improvements .",
    "this is clearly a development which we will follow .",
    "we also foresee to extend smodels to multiple branches , including sub - branches originating from the main cascade decay chains .",
    "this is relevant , , for heavy higgses ( or other non - sm `` r - even '' particles as present in models with extra dimensions ) appearing in the decay chains .",
    "we also conceive the inclusion of resonant production of new particles , as well as violation of the @xmath0 symmetry ; in the context of susy this means extension to r - parity violation . regarding the statistical treatment , for identifying the most sensitive analysis ( in order not to alter the effective cl )",
    ", it would be of great help if the experimental collaborations systematically provided also the _ expected _ upper limits in addition to the observed ones .",
    "last but not least note that the mapping from the full model signal to a sum over simplified model signal topologies is clearly not an exact procedure .",
    "it assumes that , for most experimental searches , the bsm model can be approximated by a sum over effective simplified models .",
    "the validity of this approximation , in particular _",
    "( i ) _ regarding the question how the type of production channel or the nature of the off - shell states mediating the decays affects the signal efficiencies , and _",
    "( ii ) _ regarding the question of using sms limits derived in the susy context for non - susy models , will be a subject of future work .",
    "the publication of the smodels code with a dedicated online manual is in preparation  @xcite .      shortly before submission of this paper another program package , checkmate  @xcite , became available for confronting bsm scenarios with lhc data .",
    "checkmate determines whether a model is excluded or not at 95% c.l . by comparing to many recent experimental analyses , based on fast simulation .",
    "it thus represents an interesting alternative to the sms approach followed by smodels .",
    "moreover , while the smodels paper was being refereed , another program based on sms results , fastlim  @xcite , was published .",
    "fastlim employs efficiency maps and currently takes into account 11 atlas analyses , which are mainly focused on stop and sbottom searches .",
    "restricting the smodels database to the 11 atlas analyses implemented in fastlim , we have verified that for * scan - ii * about @xmath243 of the points excluded by smodels are also excluded by fastlim and vice - versa .",
    "interestingly , from all the points excluded by smodels , @xmath244 are not excluded by fastlim ; a part of these points features a light lsp with mass of 4565  gev  this region does not seem to be covered by fastlim .",
    "the reverse is also true : from all the points excluded by fastlim , @xmath245 are not excluded by smodels .",
    "a detailed comparison of the two approaches is on the way .",
    "we recall , however , that smodels includes in total more than 50 analyses from both atlas and cms , which allows to exclude an additional 54% of points in * scan - ii*.",
