    "in the past decades , many exotic nuclei far from the valley of @xmath2-stability line with extreme n / z ratio have been produced with the new generation of radioactive - ion beam facilities  @xcite .",
    "these exotic nuclei provide us useful information on the equation of state ( eos ) of asymmetric nuclear matter , which has not been well determined and is important for understanding both the structure of unstable nuclei and the properties of neutron stars .",
    "one of the most important quantities is the nuclear symmetry energy , which affects significantly the binding energy and rms radii of neutron - rich nuclei  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the chemical composition , the evolution of lepton profiles , cooling process and the neutrino fluxes in neutron stars depend strongly on the nuclear symmetry energy  @xcite .",
    "therefore , more and more attention has been payed to study the symmetry energy in both infinite nuclear matter and finite nuclei  @xcite .    in infinite asymmetric nuclear matter",
    ", the energy density is usually expanded in terms of isospin asymmetry @xmath3 as @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 , where the nuclear symmetry energy coefficient is given by @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the energy density in symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "many investigations have already been carried out to study the density and isospin dependence of symmetry energy coefficient @xmath10  @xcite .    in finite nuclei ,",
    "nuclear symmetry energy has been studied in the finite - range droplet model ( frdm )  @xcite , random phase approximation ( rpa ) based on the hartree - bogoliubov approach  @xcite , and energy density functionals of skyrme force  @xcite as well as relativistic meson - exchange force  @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the nuclear symmetry energy coefficient @xmath11 extracted from @xmath12 is in better agreement with the empirical data than that from @xmath13 .    in this paper ,",
    "the mass number and isospin dependence of symmetry energy coefficients for isobaric chains with @xmath14 will be globally studied in a covariant density function theory and compared with the corresponding _ pseudo _ data from the experimental binding energy and semi - empirical mass formula .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ secii ] we briefly describe the method used to obtain the nuclear symmetry coefficient in finite nuclei .",
    "the results and discussion will be given in sec .",
    "[ seciii ] .",
    "finally , a short summary is presented in sec .",
    "[ seciv ] .",
    "the conventional semi - empirical mass formula of bethe and weizs@xmath15cker in liquid droplet model ( ldm ) for the binding energy of a nucleus is as follows  @xcite , @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 the number of neutrons and protons , @xmath19 the total number of nucleons , @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 , and @xmath22 are positive and represent the coefficients of bulk or volume , surface , coulomb , and symmetry energies respectively , and @xmath23 is a simple parametrization of pairing with @xmath24 .",
    "the research of interest in this work is the symmetry energy term in eq.(@xmath25 ) , which can be rewritten in terms of the isospin value @xmath26 , @xmath27 where the isospin value of a nucleus is given by @xmath28 .",
    "however , recent studies  @xcite showed that it is more proper to parameterize the nuclear symmetry energy into following form ,    @xmath29    which will be adopted to extract the symmetry energy coefficient subsequently .    on the other hand , according to the ldm formula ( [ ldm ] ) , one notices that the difference in binding energies of isobaric nuclei with same odd - even parity is only related to the coulomb energy and symmetry energy terms , @xmath30\\nonumber\\\\    & & + [ e_{\\rm   sym}(a , t)- e_{\\rm   sym}(a , t=0 ) ] .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , the _ pseudo _ experimental value of symmetry energy in eq.([sec ] ) is determined by subtracting the coulomb energy from the experimental data of nuclear total binding energy as , @xmath31-[e_{\\textrm coul.}(a , t)\\nonumber\\\\    & & -e_{\\textrm coul.}(a , t=0 ) ] ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the coulomb energy @xmath32 of a specific nucleus is calculated by assuming the nucleus as an uniformly charged spherical droplet , i.e. , @xmath33.\\ ] ] the charge radius is given by @xmath34 .",
    "the second term is from the fock - exchange term of proton .",
    "even if there is quadrupole deformation @xmath2 ( typically about @xmath35 ) deviating from sphere in a nucleus , it just reduces the coulomb energy by a factor of @xmath36 , which is negligible .",
    "therefore , it is justified to consider the nucleus as a spherical liquid drop rather than a deformed one .",
    "finally , one obtains the _ pseudo _ experimental value of symmetry energy coefficient from eqs.([sec ] ) and ( [ exp_nse ] ) , which depends on the mass number @xmath19 and isospin value @xmath26 .",
    "the theoretical study of symmetry energy coefficients for finite nuclei is based on a covariant density functional theory with nucleon - nucleon interacting by exchange of various mesons and photo for nuclear ground - state energies .",
    "the non - linear version of relativistic mean - field theory is used . the corresponding effective lagrangian density",

    "we adopt the arrows to indicate vectors in isospin space and bold types for the space vectors .",
    "greek indices @xmath47 and @xmath48 run over 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , while roman indices @xmath49 , @xmath50 , etc . denote the spatial components .",
    "the nonlinear self - coupling terms @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 for the @xmath38-meson , @xmath54-meson , and @xmath55-meson in the lagrangian density ( [ lagrangian ] ) respectively have the following forms :    @xmath56    from eq.([lagrangian ] ) combined with the mean - field approximation , one obtains the corresponding energy density functional @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the corresponding hamiltonian operator .",
    "the equations of motion for the nucleon and the mesons can be obtained by requiring that the energy functional be stationary with respect to the variations of single - particle density @xmath55 and meson fields . finally , one obtains a dirac equation for nucleon as well as inhomogeneous klein - gordon equations for meson fields and photon field .",
    "the source terms for klein - gordon equations are sums of bilinear products of dirac spinors restricted in the fermi sea .    with the restriction of spherical symmetry , both the dirac equation for",
    "the nucleon and the klein - gordon equations for the mesons and the photon become radially dependent only .",
    "these coupled equations are solved iteratively using the shooting method combined with runge - kutta algorithms and employing appropriate boundary conditions in a spherical box of radius @xmath59 fm with a step size of @xmath60 fm .",
    "more details about the numerical techniques can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    moreover , the proper treatment of center of mass ( c.m . )",
    "motion has been found very important in the explanation of coulomb energy displacement in mirror nuclei  @xcite .",
    "we adopt the same c.m .",
    "correction to the total energy after variation , as it has been used in adjusting the parameter set pk1  @xcite , @xmath61 where @xmath43 is the mass of neutron or proton , @xmath62 is the total momentum in the c.m .",
    "the total energy for the nuclear ground state is given by the summation of nuclear part @xmath63 and c.m .",
    "correction , @xmath64 the nuclear symmetry energy for certain @xmath19 and @xmath26 is finally obtained as follows , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the total energy of @xmath67 isobaric nucleus with mass number @xmath19 . the theoretical value for the coefficient of symmetry energy @xmath68 is thus determined by @xmath69 .",
    "in this section , we perform systematical calculations for @xmath70 isobars with the effective interaction pk1 .",
    "the main interesting is focused on the coefficient of symmetry energy , which is only associated with symmetry energy .",
    "it is justified to switch off the coulomb interaction in the particle - hole channel of nucleon - nucleon effective interaction in the effective lagrangian density ( [ lagrangian ] ) .     as a function of the corresponding mass number @xmath19 .",
    "the filled symbols represent the _ pseudo _ experimental data and the open symbols are the rmf predictions.,width=359 ]    figure [ fig1 ] shows the predicted nuclear symmetry energy coefficients @xmath11 in nuclei with @xmath71 as a function of the corresponding mass number @xmath19 in comparison with the corresponding _ pseudo _ data .",
    "it shows that good agreement in @xmath11 has been achieved between rmf calculation and the _ pseudo _ data except the very light nuclei with @xmath72 .",
    "the observed strong oscillating in @xmath11 of rmf calculation for small @xmath26 are associated with shell closures  @xcite . in contrary , there is no effect of shell structure in the ldm formula , which gives a moderate changing of @xmath11 as a function of mass number @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , for larger value of @xmath26 , the symmetry energy becomes less sensitive to the shell structure and its value is stabilized .",
    "as the consequence , a better agreement between rmf calculation and the _ pseudo _ data is found for large isospin value @xmath26 .    in the following , we parameterize the coefficient of symmetry energy into following two forms : @xmath73 where @xmath74 in the first form corresponds to the standard definition of coefficient of symmetry energy in infinite nuclear matter , while @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the so - called volume and surface components in symmetry energy of finite nuclei and its physical origin",

    "we carry out a global fit of the obtained coefficients of symmetry energy from _ pseudo _ data and rmf calculation via the levenberg - marquardt method .",
