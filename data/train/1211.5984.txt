    "it s well known in plasma physics community that for linear ( waves and instabilities ) problems we have two usual computational methods : eigenvalue ( dispersion relation ) solver and initial value solver . for the former ,",
    "we transform the linear time derivative @xmath0 and spatial derivatives @xmath1 to spectral space using @xmath2 and @xmath3 ; for the latter , we solve the original equations directly . in some simple case",
    ", the eigenvalue method can be reduced to analytic tractable form , e.g. , many well known dispersion relations are this type . however , numerical solutions are always ok ( except some singularity cases ) .    usually ,",
    "the eigenvalue method is not intuitive and one needs be good at theoretical derivations ; the conventional initial value method is complicated in computation and cumbersome in data analysis .",
    "typically , the eigenvalue method can give all solutions of the system , while the initial value method can only give the @xmath4 ( most unstable ) solution .",
    "can we combine these two methods ?",
    "the answer is yes .",
    "we can keep time derivative @xmath5 term ( and other term if have , e.g. , kinetic @xmath6 term ) , but transform the linear spatial derivatives @xmath7 term to @xmath3 , which is still an initial value method , but is solved in half ( only spatial not temporal ) spectral space , then also has characteristics of eigenvalue method .",
    "for example , we can highlight the non-@xmath4 solutions .",
    "we will show how to do it with examples for normal mode problems in sec.[sec : normal ] .",
    "since this method has been used for linear inhomogeneous eigenvalue and nonlinear problem by previous researchers , we will just give some necessary descriptions with citations in sec.[sec : eigen ] .",
    "in most literatures , normal mode and eigenmode are treated as a same concept since they are very similar .",
    "but , here , we distinguish them    normal mode : : :    homogeneous@xcite , without boundary conditions ; eigen mode : : :    inhomogeneous or with boundary conditions , all possible solutions of    the system can be expressed by proper sum of eigenmodes .    using half spectral ( hs ) method",
    ", many normal mode problems can be reduced from pdes to odes . then can be solved extreme easily . while , unfortunately , for eigen mode problems , the equations are in lower - dimensions but still pdes .",
    "we construct a simple example to show how to use this method .",
    "the original equations @xmath8 half spectral solves @xmath9 the dispersion relation @xmath10 gives , @xmath11 .",
    "if we assume the initial values @xmath12 , the ratio of @xmath13 is @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively , then @xmath16 , then the ratio of the amplitudes for @xmath13 is @xmath17 which means we can control the amplitudes of each modes of the system exactly by set the proper initial values .    ) , as example for half spectral method , red line is dispersion relation solutions , title=\"fig:\",width=529 ] +    a 4th order runge - kutta simulation of eq.([eq : simple_hs_hs ] ) is shown in fig.[fig : simple_hs ] .",
    "we can see the frequencies and amplitudes of each modes ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) are exact as predict .",
    "a small mismatch should be caused by the numerical discrete .",
    "usually , we have two initial value method to simulate kinetic problem ( e.g. , landau damping ) , i.e. , vlasov continuity solver and pic method .    to show that half spectral method is not only for fluid problem",
    ", we give a kinetic example . at this subsection , the electrostatic 1d landau damping and bump - on - tail simulations are given .",
    "the linearized equations ( ion immobile ) are @xmath20 which gives @xmath21 contains both normal mode ( which is independent with initial value ) and ballistic mode ( which is brought by initial value ) or phase mixing ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .    ) for landau damping , title=\"fig:\",width=453 ] +    ) for beam - plasma instability , title=\"fig:\",width=377 ] +    the initial distribution function @xmath22 can be any form , e.g. , maxwellian gives landau damping , bump - on - tail gives beam - plasma instabilities .",
    "fig.[fig : landaudamping ] shows the simulation of landau damping .",
    "one can find very similar results ( especially the fourth panel ) from vlasov continuity simulation .",
    "however , we should notice an unfavorite recurrence effect@xcite caused by discrete @xmath23 , which is also found in half spectral simulation . the recurrence time @xmath24 .",
    "fig.[fig : bumpontail ] is the simulation of bump - on - tail problem .",
    "since we treat linear problem , the unit of the amplitude can be arbitrary large .",
    "one can find , comparing with continuity solver and pic method , using half spectral method for landau damping simulation is extreme simple and can be more accurate . comparing with numerical or analytical dispersion relation solver , half spectral method does not need treat troublesome or confusing integral contours .",
    "especially , when the initial distribution function is not standard and the dispersion relation is hard to solve , the half spectral simulation can gives an reasonable solution for benchmark more complicated codes .",
    "for mhd waves , we solve @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",

    "again , we can find the simulation result exactly matches the theoretical solutions .",
    "the simulation is intuitive .",
    "the frequency signal in the second panel is taken from @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "if we only use @xmath32 signal , the shear alfvn wave solution will vanish .",
    "if one want to go non - ideal mhd , e.g. , including resistivity or using anisotropic pressure @xmath34 , but would nt like to do analytical derivations , then half spectral method is an useful choice : it is very simple , intuitive and can give solutions exact enough .",
    "since all information for linear perturbation variables is kept in the simulation , we can use them for many more deeply analysis , e.g. , the polarization and so on .",

    "the final dispersion relation can be reduced ( with heavy calculations ) to a fifth order equation for @xmath40 ( see @xcite for details ) . while , using half spectral simulation , this is very easy .",

    ", half spectral method may be the simplest method for simulating them , which is intuitive , simple and also exact enough . for analytical difficult problems",
    ", this method can not only be an intuitive tool but also has practical usages .",
    "as claimed at the title , half spectral method can be a general ( linear ) plasma simulation method .",
    "so , we also need discuss the eigenmode problem and some nonlinear treatments . while , it is found in the literatures that previous researchers have given many examples of this .",
    "so , here we just give a short description and mention some citations .",
    "eigenmode problems are similar .",
    "we take collisional tearing mode as example here .",
    "a simulation matches the half spectral idea is given by lee and fu@xcite ( see also citations of that paper ) . for simulation",
    ", we solve @xmath41 where parameter are @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "the normalization unit are @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "the results are very well in that paper@xcite .",
    "so , we can trust that half spectral method is also good for eigenmode problem .",
    "a bad thing is that , for eigenmode problem , we still need solve pdes .      in fact , an usual way for nonlinear drift wave turbulence by hasegawa - mima equation@xcite simulation is doing in spectral space , which is exact the half spectral idea of this manuscript",
    ". a very detailed introduction can be found in waltz s lecture notes@xcite . to give a rough impression ,",
    "one of the equations is shown below @xmath52    we should comment here , for nonlinear problem , we need sum all @xmath53 modes and the complex conjugate should also be kept .",
    "in this manuscript , we discussed the idea of half spectral method , and showed that it can be a general simulation method .",
    "however , this idea maybe not new , especially for eigenmode and nonlinear problem , many previous researchers used it .",
    "i do nt know whether this method is new for normal mode problems yet . and",
    "the name _ half spectral _ using here is just for convenient .    for tokamak ( or other problems with strong guide field ) simulation , a similar method",
    "is called flux tube ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which using the idea of symmetry to reduce dimensions because the physics is mainly along magnetic field line then we can take it as one coordinate .",
    "poloidal and toroidal mode numbers @xmath54 and @xmath55 are often used in flux tube simulation .",
    "i havent checked whether the equations for flux tube simulation are the same for half spectral simulation yet .",
    "they may be exact the same or at least very similar .",
    "but , we can tell that spectral or pseudo spectral method are different from this half spectral method , because that they need transform back to real space . for",
    "a same simulation , spectral or pseudo spectral method can be alternative by other discrete methods ( e.g. , finite difference ) and wo nt influent the simulation results . while , half spectral method is independent on discrete methods .",
    "this idea is partly inspired by  _",
    "a 2d hasegawa - mima model of electrostatic drift wave turbulence _ \" simulation by deng zhao ( pku , 2011 ) and p239c course project ( uci , 2010 )  _ cold plasma - warm beam interaction _ \" given by prof .",
    "the basic idea is the same .",
    "the new here is that we find this method can be generalized ."
