    "actually , several numerical simulations have tried to verify the correct spectrum using the vortex filament model@xcite . in our opinion ,",
    "none of those is fully convincing .",
    "the cascade towards smaller scales is evident in simulations but the correct value for the slope of the spectrum is dominated by a numerical noise or distorted by the method used to determine the kelvin amplitude .",
    "the simulations by kozik _ et al._@xcite , using the hamiltonian formulation of the filament model , correctly identify the kelvin modes , but their spectrum may depend on the absolute amplitude of the initial spectrum@xcite .    in bec s the kelvin spectrum has been determined by yepez",
    "_ et al._@xcite using the gross - pitaevskii equation . however , the interpretation of these results was strongly criticized@xcite . in high-@xmath2 region the @xmath4 spectrum ( originally interpeted as kelvin spectrum ) most likely results from the velocity and density profile inside the vortex cores@xcite .",
    "the low-@xmath2 region was originally interpreted as kolmogorov k41 law , even if the spectrum is likely visible at scales smaller than the intervortex distance ( authors did not evaluate the mean vortex separation ) .",
    "one option is that this spectrum comes from kelvin waves , but since the fluid is highly compressible the explanations presented in the comment@xcite are more likely . in this article",
    "we list several ways that can be used to identify kelvin waves .",
    "we work in the framework of the vortex filament model@xcite , where the vortices are considered to be thin and the superfluid velocity can be calculated simply from the vortex configuration @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the length along the vortex , using the biot - savart integral .",
    "in other words , we consider only length scales much larger than the vortex core size , @xmath7 .",
    "we start with two simple cases where the definition of the kelvin waves is obvious : straight vortex with kelvin waves and a vortex ring occupied by kws . in both cases",
    "the kelvin spectrum can be determined using a simple fourier transformation .",
    "we use these two sample cases to test other methods that have been used previously in the literature .",
    "such methods are , for example , curvature , energy spectrum and fractal dimension .",
    "kelvin waves are helical distortions on a vortex",
    ". they can be generated by applying a counterflow @xmath8 along a vortex@xcite .",
    "vortex reconnection , and more generally , interaction with other vortices , with vortex itself or with boundaries also induce kelvin waves . in the small amplitude and long wavelength limit",
    "the dispersion relation for a kelvin wave with wave vector @xmath2 is given by @xmath9 here @xmath10 ( for @xmath3he ) or @xmath11 ( for @xmath12he - b ) is the circulation quantum , @xmath7 the vortex core size and @xmath13 is the euler constant .    on a straight vortex ( taken to be along the @xmath14-axis ) the",
    "definition and identification of the kelvin waves is simple .",
    "assume that a vortex can be represented as coordinates @xmath15 and @xmath16 and define @xmath17 .",
    "now the vortex configuration can be presented as a sum of different kelvin modes : @xmath18 in case of periodic boundary conditions along the @xmath14-direction ( typical for simulations ) , the @xmath2-vector is discrete and given by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 ( mode ) is integer and @xmath21 is the period . for a particular vortex configuration kelvin spectrum can be defined as @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "theoretical predictions , which apply for a statistical average , predict that the steady - state kelvin spectrum takes the form@xcite @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "this spectrum results from interaction of different scale kelvin waves and provides a constant ( @xmath2-independent ) energy flux , @xmath26 , through different scales .",
    "if @xmath27 ( with @xmath28 ) determines the fraction of positive kelvin modes , then we can parametrize the amplitudes using the modes : @xmath29 , then even the interpolation used to obtain the vortex configuration at equidistant points ( needed for fft ) can result in errors that distort the spectrum for @xmath2-values @xmath30 .",
    "one way to avoid these errors is to directly solve the fourier coefficients .",
    "but then one loses the speedup obtained by fft .",
    "an alternative is to keep the vortex points equally @xmath14-distributed by removing the motion along the @xmath14-direction . by introducing a vector @xmath31 , which only determines the point of intersection of the vortex line with the plane ,",
    "one obtains that@xcite @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the unit vector along the @xmath14-axis .",
    "this formula , together with the biot - savart equation can be used to derive the hamiltonian equation for the vortex motion@xcite .",
    "this projection should be used with care , since it limits the real vortex motion .",
    "it , for example , prohibits a vortex to reconnect with itself .    cascade due to kelvin waves is typically very weak .",
    "the energy flux , @xmath26 , can be increased by increasing the amplitudes of the kelvin waves .",
    "simulations always contain some dissipation ( or noise ) that typically is strongest at the smallest scales . for small energy flux",
    "this numerical dissipation may , in some cases , correctly mimic the energy sink .",
    "however , if the numerics is done in a such way that the energy is well conserved , this flow out from the numerical @xmath2-region can become smaller than the energy flux due to kelvin - wave cascade .",
    "this results in a numerical bottleneck , implying accumulation of kelvin waves near the resolution limit and generally resulting excessive fractality and noise . in simulations",
    "this can often be seen as a failure of the fourier presentation for the vortex . therefore , any numerical method that tries to determine the steady - state kelvin spectrum should contain enough dissipation such that this bottleneck due to finite resolution is avoided .",
    "how this is implemented in numerics , especially with the vortex filament model , is still somewhat open question .",
    "one option is to work at finite temperatures and have high enough resolution such that all the energy can be dissipated by mutual friction .",
    "important is , that a proper dissipation is arranged dynamically . simply damping the highest modes might not be enough .",
    "one should also note that near the resolution limit the dispersion relation , eq .",
    "( [ e.kelvinfreq ] ) , may become distorted .",
    "simple estimation states that @xmath34 becomes flat near @xmath35 .",
    "because the dynamics is not accurately modeled at the smallest scales , these scales can result in different spectrum and should therefore be omitted from the fits .",
    "for a vortex ring with kelvin waves one can also make a fourier presentation . consider a vortex ring of radius @xmath36 in the @xmath37 plane located symmetrically around the @xmath14-axis .",
    "if we occupy the ring with kelvin waves , in a similar fashion than a straight vortex , we may parametrize it as follows : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the azimuthal angle and @xmath40 is the phase of the mode @xmath20 .",
    "amplitudes @xmath41 ( which correspond to @xmath42 , in case of a straight vortex ) can be calculated using a fft in the following way : first the points along the vortex must be interpolated at equidistant @xmath43 points .",
    "this can be realized using _",
    "e.g. _ cubic interpolation . now",
    "the fourier transformation of @xmath44 directly determines the @xmath41 s .",
    "the zero frequency term from the fourier transformation gives both the ring radius @xmath36 ( real part ) and also the location of the ring , @xmath45 ( imaginary part ) .",
    "if we want to occupy the vortex with a particular spectrum , we can take @xmath46 here @xmath27 ( with @xmath28 ) determines the fraction of positive and negative kelvin modes . at zero temperature , or when the normal fluid is at rest , kinetic energy and momentum are only due to superfluid component and completely determined by the vortex configuration ( we ignore externally applied velocities ) .",
    "additionally , if vortices form loops and the vorticity disappears at the infinity , one may evaluate kinetic energy , @xmath47 , and momentum , @xmath48 , in numerically convenient way by line integrals over the vortex configuration : @xmath49 these formulas make it possible to evaluate the accuracy of the numerical scheme used . at zero temperature both",
    "the energy and momentum should be conserved . however , even if the energy is well conserved , _",
    "e.g. _ by accuracy of 0.1 percent , this fluctuation is still very large if we compare it with the energy related to smallest scale kelvin waves .",
    "therefore , the errors coming from the time iteration scheme can be large at the smallest length scales . in the following we are not concentrating on these errors but pay attention only to methods that try to identify the kelvin waves on a tangle .",
    "in other words , we assume that the vortex configuration is correct at the numerical points @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "in case of vortex tangle the identification of kelvin waves becomes tedious .",
    "one easily seeks different indirect methods to identify small scale kelvin waves .",
    "the most obvious thing is to calculate local curvature @xmath52 along the vortex .",
    "an increasing average curvature is a clear sign that more small scale structures appear .",
    "a histogram describing the distribution of curvature gives some more information , but our tests indicate that curvature histogram is a poor method to determine the kelvin spectrum ( exponent @xmath53 ) . for example , the location of the histogram maximum depends , not only on the spectrum , but also on the amplitude , as illustrated in fig .",

    "[ f.ekvortexkws ] where we have plotted the 3d energy spectrum for a straight vortex with and without kelvin waves .",

    "the increased length only raises the spectrum up without affecting the slope in the high-@xmath2 region . in case of vortex ring",
    "the identification of kelvin waves is even more complicated due to the oscillations that are already present for a ring without kelvin waves .",
    "this just emphasizes that in order to identify the kelvin spectrum the direct measurement of the vortex position becomes more important than determination of the 3d energy spectrum at high @xmath2-values .",
    "at low temperatures vortices typically look quite wiggly , almost fractal like .",
    "this is due to kelvin waves .",
    "therefore , one way to characterize the tangle is to determine the fractal dimension for vortex lines@xcite .",
    "upper - bound estimate for the fractal dimension can be calculated by determining the correlation dimension @xmath93 introduced by grassberger and procaccia @xcite . in case of @xmath55 discretization points ,",
    "@xmath93 can be determined by calculating the number of point pairs , @xmath94 , whose separation is less than @xmath95 . in the limit of @xmath96",

    "how are different kelvin spectra and @xmath93 related ? in order to answer this we have determined @xmath93 in case of vortex ring that is occupied by kelvin waves with different spectra and with different amplitudes .",
    "figure [ f.fdim ] summarizes our results .",
    "as expected , @xmath93 is clearly bigger than unity only when @xmath99 and when the amplitude is large enough .",
    "this limits the usability of the fractal dimension to spectra that are less steep than predicted theoretically .",
    "the dependence on the amplitude makes it difficult to determine @xmath53 accurately .",
    "however , if one observes a correlation dimension that is clearly larger than unity , then one can almost certainly state that @xmath100 . also , even if we used a simple vortex ring to determine the fractal dimension , the results should be valid more generally at scales smaller than the average intervortex separation , _ i.e. _ in the region where the kelvin cascade is important .",
    "the difficulty in determining the fractal dimension is that numerical noise near the resolution limit ( appearing because there are too few pairs ) causes that @xmath101 .",
    "we observed that this happens especially when the amplitude is large and @xmath53 is small ( near unity )",
    ". therefore , the fit region should be limited to scales larger than the numerical resolution .",
    "the incorrectly chosen fit region might explain why the calculated correlation dimensions ( of order 1.5 ) in ref .",
    "[ ] are much bigger than the presented configuration ( fig .  20 in that article ) would suggest .",
    "for example , kelvin spectrum with @xmath102 and with amplitude @xmath103 , presented in the inset of fig .",

    "for a vortex tangle the identification of kelvin waves can be done by using the concept of `` smoothed vortex''@xcite . from the original discretized vortex filaments , determined by points @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , one can construct a smoothed vortex line @xmath105 by using every @xmath94th points as nodes for a cubic - spline interpolation .",

    "this removes the discontinuities of the derivatives @xmath120 appearing when @xmath121 , which is one reason why the spectrum tends towards @xmath122 .",
    "we have tried this type of interpolation but so far the improvements are only minor .",
    "here we have presented several methods that can be used to identify kelvin waves . in case of a straight vortex or a vortex ring",
    "the identification can be done most reliable . however , in case of vortex tangle a great care should be used .",
    "the biggest problem is the lack of proper definition of a kelvin wave on a curved vortex . in order to properly define a kelvin wave there",
    "must exist a scale separation between the characteristic size of the underlying vortex and its disturbances .",
    "generally the kelvin cascade to smaller scales can be qualitatively identified using , _",

    "it is alarming that some numerical methods can result in a spectrum that is totally incorrect but still very close to the spectrum predicted theoretically .",
    "therefore , all methods should be properly tested using a simple configuration where the spectrum is known in advance .",
    "the highly dominating geometrical @xmath1 scaling in the 3d energy spectrum at high-@xmath2 illustrates that at small scales the determination of the vortex location becomes much more essential than the knowledge of the energy spectrum . only after determining the vortex location",
