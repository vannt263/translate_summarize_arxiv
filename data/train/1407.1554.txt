    "rhic , at brookhaven national laboratory , started the beam energy scan ( bes ) program since 2010 in order to explore the qcd phase diagram .",
    "the star experiment , at rhic , has collected data at @xmath1  = 39 gev down to 7.7 gev for this bes program .",
    "the main goals of the bes program are to ( 1 ) locate the existence of the qcd critical point , ( 2 ) find evidence of the first order phase transition in the qcd phase diagram , and ( 3 ) understand the properties of the qgp as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "the variation of rhic colliding energy from @xmath1  = 7.7 to 39 gev , along with 62.4 and 200 gev , covers the baryonic chemical potential from 410 to 20 mev  @xcite .",
    "the rhic beam energy scan program started in the year 2010 and the first phase of the beam energy scan has been finished in year 2014 with @xmath1  = 14.5 gev data taking .",

    "the star experiment is able to measure various e - by - e observables to study the signatures of qgp - to - hadron - gas phase transition .",
    "full 2@xmath3 azimuthal coverage , enriched particle identification capabilities and large uniform acceptance of star provides a suitable environment for the e - by - e characterizations of heavy - ion - collisions . in order to achieve the goals of the bes program ,",
    "the star collaboration have analyzed various e - by - e fluctuation measures . for the search of qcd critical point , higher - moments of the conserved charge , like net - charge , net - protons (",
    "proxy for net - baryon ) and net - kaon ( proxy for net - strangeness ) distributions , particle ratio fluctuation , and transverse momentum fluctuations have been analyzed .",
    "dynamical charge fluctuations for the signature of qgp have been studied as well .",

    "lattice qcd calculations reveal that at vanishing @xmath4 , the transition from qgp to hadron gas is a simple crossover  @xcite , whereas at large @xmath4 , the phase transition is of first order  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one expects the existence of a critical point at the end of the first order phase transition .",
    "search for the qcd critical point has been one of the major thrusts of the rhic bes program .    at the critical point ,",
    "thermodynamic susceptibilities and the correlation length ( @xmath5 ) of the system are expected to diverge for large samples in equilibrium .",
    "the finite volume effect puts a constraint on the divergence of the thermodynamic susceptibilities and @xmath5 of the system .",
    "the phenomenon of critical slowing down in the vicinity of the critical point drives the system away from thermodynamic equilibrium , so @xmath5 reaches a maximum value of around @xmath6  fm  @xcite .",
    "besides these challenges , in heavy - ion - collision experiments , the signature of critical point could be observed if the critical point is close enough to the freeze - out curve  @xcite .",
    "various observables such as , higher - moments of the conserved charge , transverse momentum fluctuations , particle ratio fluctuations , have been proposed in order to search for the qcd critical point .",
    "detailed discussions about these analysis and their observables can be found in the following sections .",
    "moments of the conserved charge distributions ( such as the mean ( @xmath7 ) , standard deviation ( @xmath8 ) , skewness ( @xmath9 ) and kurtosis ( @xmath10 ) ) have been proposed as important observables for the signature of the qcd critical point in the current wisdom .",
    "the higher - moments of conserved charge distributions are related to the respective higher order thermodynamical susceptibilities and also @xmath5 of the system  @xcite . in order to cancel the undetermined volume term in the higher - moments , ratio ( or product ) like @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13",
    "the signature of non - monotonicity of these observables is expected if there is a nearby critical point in qcd phase transition .",
    "recently , the star experiment reported net - charge  @xcite and net - proton  @xcite results from the bes program .    in an analysis of higher - moments , various sophisticated techniques , like the finite bin width effect  @xcite , finite efficiency correction  @xcite for the higher - moments , have been incorporated . in order to get precise statistical uncertainty , different statistical error estimation methods ( like the delta theorem , bootstrap method , etc . ) have been throughly studied and utilized . on the other hand , new centrality definitions ( like uncorrected charge multiplicity within @xmath14 for net - charge analysis and that of other than identified protons and antiprotons within pseudo - rapidity @xmath15 for net - proton ) have also been studied and implemented .",
    "the positive ( @xmath16 ) and negative ( @xmath17 ) charged particle multiplicities are counted within @xmath18 and @xmath19  gev/_c _ ( after removing protons and anti - protons with @xmath20  mev/_c _ ) to calculate net - charge ( @xmath21 ) in each event .",

    "similarly , poisson , independent particle production expectation and urqmd model simulation have been performed for the net - proton analysis .",
    "these baselines lack any qcd critical point phenomena , therefore it is expected that any deviation from these baselines could be due to the possible presence of new physics in the data . in general ,",
    "both nbd and poisson baseline calculations overestimate the net - charge data .",
    "for central collisions , within the statistical and systematic errors , the values @xmath13  of the net - charge distribution at all energies are consistent with each other except for @xmath1  = 7.7 gev .",
    "the significance of deviation of data with respect to both the baselines remains within 2@xmath8 in case of @xmath12  and @xmath13 .",
    "this implies that the products of moments of net - charge distributions do not show non - monotonic behavior as a function of beam energy within statistical errors .",
    "the large statistical uncertainty plays an important role for the net - charge higher - moments analysis and also puts a constraint for any definite conclusion .",
