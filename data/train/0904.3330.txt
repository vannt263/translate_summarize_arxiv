    "galaxies contain dust . galaxies detected through their absorption signature imprinted onto qso spectra",
    "are no exception .",
    "the presence of dust in damped lyman alpha ( dla ) systems and other high column density absorbers has been demonstrated ubiquitously through depletion patterns of chemical elements ( see the review by wolfe et al .",
    "2005 ) and more occasionally through the direct detection of some extinction feature , such as the 2175   bump ( junkarrinen et al .",
    "2004 ; wang et al 2004 ; ellison et al .",
    "2006 ) . in one case ,",
    "the 9.7 @xmath6 m silicate feature has been detected ( kukarni et al . 2007 ) .",
    "indirectly , the presence of dust can be inferred through the ratios of refractory and non - refractory elements to infer a gas - to - dust ratio , detection of molecular absorption ( e.g. noterdaeme et al . 2008 ) , abundance ratio gradients in a dla towards a lensed qso ( lopez et al .",
    "2005 ) and diffuse interstellar bands ( york et al . 2006 ; ellison et al .",
    "2008 ; lawton et al . 2008 ) .",
    "it is therefore perhaps unsurprising that for as long as quasar absorption lines have been used to probe high redshift galaxies ( e.g. wolfe et al . 1986 ) , there have been concerns that dust biases the results ( e.g. ostriker & heisler 1984 ) .",
    "early work indicated that a significant fraction of absorption - selected galaxies might indeed be missed from surveys based on magnitude - limited optical qso samples ( fall , pei & mcmahon 1989 ; pei , fall & bechtold 1991 ; fall & pei 1993 ) .",
    "more recent observations have tackled this problem with either very large samples ( murphy & liske 2004 ; vladilo , prochaska & wolfe 2008 ) , or radio - selected qso samples ( ellison et al . 2001 ; ellison , hall & lira 2005 ; jorgenson et al 2006 ) .",
    "although certain special classes of qso absorbers have been shown to exhibit substantial reddening , such as the ca  ii absorbers and very high equivalent width 2  absorbers ( wild , hewett & pettini 2006 ; menard et al .",
    "2008 ) , in general reddening in the dla absorbers is small . although a handful of individual reddening measurements have been obtained ( e.g. vladilo et al . 2006 ) and a minority have quite high inferred reddening values ( e.g. junkkarinen et al .",
    "2004 ) , the mean e(b@xmath7v ) in dlas is low .",
    "vladilo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found e(b@xmath7v ) @xmath8 0.005 mag in a large sample of dlas selected from the magnitude limited sloan digital sky survey .",
    "ellison et al .",
    "( 2005 ) measured e(b@xmath7v ) @xmath9 0.04 mag in an optically complete radio sample of dlas .",
    "it is also found that the number density and total neutral gas fraction in radio - selected samples is in good agreement with large optical samples ( jorgenson et al .",
    "the typical metallicity of radio - selected samples is also only marginally higher , by 0.2 dex , than optical samples ( akerman et al . 2005 ) .",
    "although the extinction models presented by vladilo & proux ( 2005 ) suggest that @xmath10 ( the neutral gas mass fraction in dlas ) is under - estimated by at least a factor of two by optical surveys , other models have come up with much lower corrections ( e.g. trenti & stiavelli 2006 ) .",
    "most recently , pontzen & pettini ( 2008 ) have used bayesian statistics to estimate that only 7% of dlas are missed from magnitude limited dla surveys with an under - estimate of @xmath11 of 13% .",
    "they suggest that the larger corrections found by vladilo & proux ( 2005 ) may be in part due to their smaller sample of purely optically selected absorbers with measured abundances ( that are often biased by observers preferential selection of high systems ) .",
    "although this substantial body of contemporary work has shown that there is no convincing evidence for a substantial dust bias , these results are largely limited to high redshifts , @xmath12 .",
    "however , intermediate and low mass galaxies ( log m@xmath13 m@xmath14 ) are still actively assembling their stellar mass at this epoch with significant chemical enrichment occuring at lower redshifts ( e.g. perez - gonzalez et al .",
    "2008 ; panter et al .",
    "2008 ) . whilst one might reasonably expect the chemical evolution of the general galaxy population to evolve monotonically with redshift ,",
    "the reddening and extinction of background quasars is a function of the qso and absorber redshift , plus the extinction curve .",
    "for example , in a previous corals paper by ellison , hall & lira ( 2005 ) , the goal was to search for a reddening signature , so that the extinction curves and redshifts were accounted for in monte carlo simulations . in the current paper ,",
    "the chemical abundances are used as an indicator of whether magnitude limited samples , on average , have distinct abundance properties compared to optically complete surveys .",
    "given the smaller apertures of the space telescopes required to confirm low redshift dlas , quantifying the impact on chemical abundances due to dust bias at @xmath15 is particularly germane .",
    "the only assessment of the impact of dust bias at low redshifts was performed by ellison et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . using an optically complete radio - selected sample of quasars , ellison et al .",
    "( 2004 ) determined that the number density of high equivalent width ( ew ) 2  absorbers was in good agreement with optical samples .",
    "3050% of these strong 2  absorbers are expected to be dlas ( rao & turnshek 2000 ; rao , turnshek & nestor 2006 ) , confirmation which requires uv observations of the  line . in the absence of such data ( and pending the installation of a uv spectrograph on the hubble space telescope , hst , during the next servicing mission ) , we can nonetheless assess the dust depletion in the 2selected absorbers of ellison et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .    in this paper , we present the results of new observations of 16 2 -selected absorbers from the optically complete sample of ellison et al .",
    "the new data consist of spectra of 15 qsos obtained with the uv and visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) on the very large telescope ( vlt ) , plus one archival spectrum obtained with the high resolution echelle spectrograph ( hires ) on keck . by comparing the ratios of zn and fe column densities with observations from the literature",
    ", it is shown that the dust depletion of these absorbers is commensurate with optical samples .",
    "in order to assess the effect of dust bias on absorption system identification at @xmath16 , ellison et al . ( 2004 ) searched for 2absorbers in an optically complete sample of radio - loud qsos .",
    "based on the observation by rao & turnshek ( 2000 ) and rao et al .",
    "( 2006 ) that absorbers with both high ews of 2  and 2  have a high chance of being dlas , we selected all absorbers in the ellison et al .",
    "( 2004 ) sample with ew(2 @xmath17 0.5   and ew(2 @xmath18 0.5   for high resolution follow - up .",
    "there are 12 such absorbers that fulfill these criteria ( see table 3 of ellison et al .",
    "2004)223 were not real . also , the @xmath19 absorber towards b1230@xmath7101 is now known to be a superposition of many c  iv lines . the absorbers in these two lines of sight are therefore not included in our statistics . ] . in addition , there are four more absorbers with ew(2 @xmath18 0.5 but either no coverage of 2  @xmath20 , or with an upper limit that is greater than 0.5   reported in ellison et al . ( 2004 ) . in order to obtain a cleanly selected statistical sample ,",
    "uves spectra were also obtained for these four sightlines .",
    "two of these four are found to have ew(2 @xmath17 0.5   from our uves spectra . in table [ obs_table ] we list the 16 absorbers , their redshifts are the original values reported by ellison et al .",

    "( 2006 ) found that no dla in their large ( statistical ) sample of 197 2  systems at @xmath22 has an ew(2 @xmath23 0.6  , our echelle observations should include all possible dlas from the low redshift corals sample .",

    "the average spectral s / n ratio of our sample is lower than is typically obtained for abundance determinations .",
    "this is a result of the fact that an optically complete sample , such as corals from which these targets are drawn , will include many fainter qsos than a magnitude limited sample .",
    "the lower s / n ratios hamper detailed voigt profile decomposition , so that we instead determine total column densities using the apparent optical depth method ( aodm , e.g. savage & sembach 1991 ) .",
    "this technique is a widely used alternative to voigt fitting of qso absorption lines ( e.g. prochaska et al .",
    "although the aodm is potentially susceptible to ` hidden saturation ' dla column densities derived with this method generally give good agreement with other techniques .",
    "although fox , savage & wakker ( 2005 ) showed that the aodm may over - estimate column densities by @xmath8 10% in low s / n data , the relative abundances derived here should be unaffected by systematic offsets .",
    "we derive column densities ( or limits ) for 2 , 2 , 2 and 2  in the majority of our absorbers .",
    "2  can be determined for only a small number of systems due to the low redshift range of the absorbers .",
    "when more than one transition is observed for a given species ( as is often the case for 2 ) , we compare the column densities derived from each to test for possible saturation ( i.e. the highest @xmath30-value line yields a column density which is significantly lower than the other transitions ) . a line that is suspected to be saturated",
    "is discarded ( this process is in addition to the rejection of lines that are clearly saturated with zero residual flux in their line cores ) . in the absence of suspected saturation",
    ", the average of the column densities from multple transitions is adopted .",
    "absorption line profiles of selected transitions for our qso sample are shown in figures [ b0039 ]  [ b2245 ] .",
    "we use the atomic data tabulated by morton ( 2003 ) which is reproduced in table [ atom_data ] for ease of reference .",
    "the measured column densities are given in table [ col_table ] , as well as improved absorption redshifts derived from the uves data .",
    "we adopt the usual assumption that the singly ionized species studied here approximate the total column density of a given element .",
    "although there are likely to be ionization corrections for the lower  absorbers , we do not have the necessary data to estimate these corrections .",
    "dessauges - zavadsky ( 2003 ) have previously estimated that ionization corrections are likely to be on the order of 0.1  0.2 dex .",
    "however , such corrections are sensitive to the input ionizing spectrum and so the corrections could be significantly larger ( howk & sembach 1999 ; meiring et al . 2007 ) .",
    "corrections for zinc are further complicated by large uncertainties in the atomic data ( howk & sembach 1999 ; dessauges - zavadsky et al .",
    "although ionization corrections may therefore lead to errors in our derived column densities , this same problem should be present in the comparison data taken from the literature ( at a given ) .",
    "a differential comparison between the abundance ratios in the corals absorbers and the optical samples taken from the literature is therefore still feasible .",
