    "the moments of the general heisenberg hamiltonian describing a large class of spin systems represent valuable information for various purposes . they can be used to check numerical exact or approximate calculations of the energy spectrum of such systems .",

    "hence they can be used to calculate the leading terms of the hte of physical relevant functions such as specific heat or magnetic susceptibility , see e.  g.  @xcite or @xcite . analytic expression for the moments in the general heisenberg case ( arbitrary number of spins @xmath3 and coupling",
    "constants @xmath4 , arbitrary spin quantum number @xmath2 ) are interesting since they can be used to investigate the dependence of physical properties on the coupling constants even in cases where a numerical investigation is not possible due to large @xmath3 or @xmath2 .",
    "it seems that such analytical expressions for moments have only be published up to order three , see @xcite , although the polynomials which appear in such expressions are known up to @xmath5th order , see @xcite . those papers which consider higher order expansions are usually confined to special coupling geometries or and/or @xmath6 , see e.  g.  @xcite- @xcite .    in this article",

    "+ from the expansion @xmath116 it is clear that the expressions for the moments @xmath0 involve various products of coupling constants @xmath4 .",

    "then we define @xmath129    obviously , the definition of @xmath119 does not depend on the choice of representatives @xmath127 since the product @xmath130 is invariant under permutations from the symmetry group @xmath131 .",

    "we consider @xmath142 .",
    "it is obvious that this product can be written as a sum over evaluations of the three multigraphs which can be combined from @xmath143 and @xmath144 , namely @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "similar expressions can be derived for other products of evaluations where suitable coefficients will compensate the change of symmetry groups . for the purpose of the present paper",
    "we will need the following  product rules \" : @xmath148    from these equations one can derive further ones for multiple products , for example :    @xmath149",
    "it turns out that the moments @xmath0 can be written in the following way : @xmath150 here the @xmath151 denote certain multigraphs of size @xmath152 and the @xmath153 are polynomials of order @xmath154 in the variable @xmath155 .",
    "it is crucial that these polynomials depend neither on @xmath3 nor on the coupling constants @xmath4 whereas the terms @xmath156 depend only on the coupling constants and only implicitly on @xmath3 via ( [ d2 ] ) . for the determination of @xmath0 it thus suffices to enumerate the multigraphs @xmath157 and the corresponding polynomials @xmath153 .",

    "they are given by the following expressions :    @xmath162    @xmath163    and    @xmath164      it is well - known that the coefficients of the power series for the free energy @xmath165 @xmath166 can be expressed in terms of the moments @xmath0 and its products . as indicated in section [ sec : d ] , a variety of product rules can be used to simplify the resulting expressions .",
    "this simplification , which is sometimes also referred to as the  cumulant expansion \" , see @xcite , has the further advantage that it reveals the extensive character of the @xmath9 , see section [ sec : r_susc ] for a more detailed discussion .",

    "@xmath167      to obtain the magnetic moments @xmath168 we can use a special method which is available if one knows the moments @xmath0 for all values of the coupling constants @xmath4 .",
    "we replace @xmath169 by the one parameter family of hamiltonians @xmath170 .",
    "equivalently we can substitute @xmath171 for all coupling constants .",
    "the magnetic moments then result from differentiating @xmath172 w.  r.  t.  @xmath173 and finally setting @xmath174 :    @xmath175    we can calculate the left hand side of ( [ r7a ] ) if we insert the results for the moments and consider  derivatives \" @xmath176 of multigraphs defined in the following way .",

    "it is obvious that the evaluation of @xmath176 just yields @xmath185 .",
    "then it is a straightforward task to calculate the magnetic moments @xmath186 by using the above results for the @xmath0 .",

    "the first @xmath11 coefficients are given by : @xmath188    inserting the known values for the @xmath0 and the @xmath168 yields the desired results for the @xmath140 .",
    "similarly as in section [ sec : r_f ] , a variety of product rules can be used to simplify the resulting expressions revealing the extensive character of the @xmath140 . by this",
    "we mean the following .",
    "if the spin system under consideration would have a periodic lattice structure of , say , @xmath189 lattice units with periodic boundary conditions , it follows immediately that the evaluation of a single multigraph @xmath190 linearly scales with @xmath189 , and hence with @xmath3 , as long as @xmath104 is connected . for unconnected @xmath104",
    "the evaluation scales with @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the number of connected components of @xmath104 .",
    "obviously , products of evaluations of connected multigraphs @xmath141 would scale with @xmath193 .",
    "it turns out that the elimination of these and higher products in the expression for the @xmath140 by means of the rules ( [ d3a])-([d3r ] ) also eliminates the evaluation terms of unconnected multigraphs .",
    "this has to be expected on physical grounds , since the total susceptibility of a spin lattice should be an extensive quantity , i.  e.  linearly scale with @xmath189 .",
    "but it is an additional consistency test of our results that the non - extensive contributions to the @xmath140 actually cancel .",
