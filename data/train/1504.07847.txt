    "a recent experimental development in optical lattices offers the unprecedented potential to study the dynamical properties of many - body interacting ultracold atoms @xcite .",
    "in particular , the superfluid flow of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) loaded on a lattice exhibits a novel instability called dynamical instability that was predicted a decade ago @xcite , which has attracted much attention both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "the dynamical instability is induced by the interplay between the lattice periodicity and nonlinearity due to the inter - particle interactions in the bec .",
    "when the system becomes dynamically unstable , the energy of an excited mode has an imaginary part @xcite .",
    "therefore , an arbitrary small density fluctuation in a uniform superfluid flow grows exponentially in time , resulting in a drastic decay of the original flow .",
    "these features are in contrast with the well - known landau instability , which is the energetic instability caused by decaying from the initial metastable state .",
    "dynamical instability itself is widely seen in various nonlinear systems governed by classical fluid mechanics . however , using ultracold atoms , we can now advance the study of superfluid instabilities to the next stage , namely dynamical instabilities in systems with internal degrees of freedom .",
    "it has been known that multicomponent systems exhibit rich physics such as diverse quantum phases in an optical lattice @xcite , and the dynamical instability of multicomponent bosons has also recently been studied @xcite .",
    "moreover , bosons with unfrozen spin degrees of freedom specifically exhibit complex and intriguing phenomena caused by spin mixing processes @xcite .",
    "the spin-1 bosons have therefore been investigated intensively as the simplest bosonic system with unfrozen spin degrees of freedom .",
    "a series of studies have revealed interesting instabilities in the spin-1 bec based on the gross - pitaevskii equation , spin mixing instability @xcite , spin counterflow instability @xcite , and the spontaneous formation of spin domains @xcite .",
    "these phenomena are specific to the spin-1 bosonic system and have hardly been understood only by conventional linear stability analysis @xcite because of the spin mixing process inherent in the system .",
    "the spin-1 bosons in optical lattices are well described by the @xmath0 bose - hubbard model ( bhm ) @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram and the static properties of this model have already been extensively studied using several theoretical methods @xcite . from these studies ,",
    "the gutzwiller - type variational wave functions are good at capturing the superfluid ( sf ) to mott - insulator ( mi ) transition in the @xmath0 bhm , aside from spin correlations in the mi phase @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the sf - mi transition in this model strongly depends on whether the average particle number per site , @xmath1 , is even or odd @xcite .",
    "we study the effect of spin interaction in the dynamical instability according to the following three interests .",
    "first , whether does the parity about the average number of particles per site as mentioned above also appear in the dynamical phase diagram or not ? this motivates us to explore a role of spin degrees of freedom in dynamical phenomena of a superfluid , which remains to be clarified .",
    "second , how do spin mixing processes among spin components in spin-1 superfluid flows affect the dynamical instability ?",
    "spin mixing , which is an important feature in bosonic spin systems , does not exist in classical fluids and multicomponent cold atom systems .",
    "therefore , the effect of spin mixing on instabilities of fluids itself is intriguing . finally , we are interested in the very recent development of experimental techniques for observing spin dynamics of condensates in optical lattices as reported by l. zhao _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "it was revealed experimentally that the intensity of lattice potential significantly affects spin mixing dynamics in a spin-1 system .",
    "the experiment of the dynamical instability in a spin-1 system is therefore expected to be demonstrated in the near future .    in this paper , we analyze the dynamical instability of the spin-1 condensate in the @xmath0 bhm for a wide range of interaction parameters with antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic interactions , focusing on the stability of spin - resolved superfluid flows .",
    "first , we reveal how the spin mixing process affects the real - time evolution of each spin component in the flow .",
    "we employ the dynamical gutzwiller approximation that was used by altman _",
    "@xcite to analyze the dynamical instability of an sf in the spinless bhm .",
    "recently , natu _ et al .",
    "_ also applied this method to the @xmath0 bhm and they calculated the low - lying excitation spectrum @xcite .",
    "we show the dynamical decay of the @xmath0 superfluid flow and the corresponding time development of the spin components .",
    "next , we demonstrate the parity dependence of dynamical instability in the @xmath0 bhm constructing dynamical phase diagrams . in the antiferromagnetic case ,",
    "the stable flow region on the phase diagram shrinks when the average number of particles is odd , while it grows for the even average numbers compared with the spinless case .",
    "we find that this phenomenon is caused by the spin mixing process .",
    "finally , we discuss the density and spin modulations associated with the dynamical instability with or without a uniform magnetic field .",
    "the hamiltonian of the @xmath0 bhm is given as @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the hopping amplitude of bosons , @xmath4 in the summation denotes the pairs of nearest neighbors , @xmath5 is the chemical potential , @xmath6 is the on - site spin - independent repulsion , and @xmath7 is the on - site spin - dependent interaction . in cold atom systems ,",
    "the @xmath7 value depends on the @xmath8-wave scattering length , which is specific to atom species ; for example , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) for na ( rb ) atoms .",
    "@xmath11 is the annihilation operator of a boson at site @xmath12 with a spin state @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , the local particle number operator @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the spin operator at site @xmath12 where @xmath17 corresponds to the spin-1 matrices .",
    "the square of the local spin operator @xmath18 is represented in a more convenient formula : @xmath19 where the ladder operators are defined by @xmath20 and @xmath21 , correspondingly .",
    "this formula can also be written in terms of creation and annihilation operators , @xmath22 the last two terms in eq.([sp ] ) induce spin mixing between the @xmath23 and @xmath24 states , which enriches the physics of this model compared with spinless models or multi - component models without any mixing of components .",
    "we first investigate the quantum dynamics of this model within the dynamical gutzwiller scheme @xcite .",
    "the variational wave function for the @xmath0 bhm can be written as the direct product of superposition states at each lattice site @xmath25    , \\label{gwf}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 denotes the local fock state determined by the local number of atoms for each spin component at site @xmath12 . here",
    "the gutzwiller parameters are normalized as @xmath27 . minimizing @xmath28 on the basis of the time - dependent variational principle",
    ", we derive equations of motion with respect to these gutzwiller parameters @xcite .",
    "the equations are explicitly shown in the appendix .",
    "note that @xmath29 in eq.([eom2 ] ) corresponds to the relative momentum between a condensate and a lattice for a condensate on a moving lattice or a moving condensate on a stationary lattice .",
    "we introduce @xmath29 as the phase difference between particles at adjacent sites using the transformation : @xmath30 ( note that , @xmath3 represents time here ) . in the time - evolution calculations , we assume @xmath31 at the initial time and the system stays in the ground state initially for given @xmath32 and @xmath7 .",
    "the momentum is then increased linearly with time at the acceleration rate @xmath33 : @xmath34 .",
    "we perform this procedure almost adiabatically by choosing a very small rate @xmath35 .",
    "since loss of atoms is neglected in our study , the total number of particles should be conserved during time evolution .",
    "we ensure the number conservation from the fact that the filling @xmath36 ( i.e. , the average particle number per site ) is kept constant within the numerical precision .",
    "the calculated system is a two - dimensional lattice with a unit size @xmath37 with periodic boundary conditions , and we set the hopping amplitude @xmath38 as a unit of energy . in our calculation",
    ", the sum of the wavefunction ( [ gwf ] ) is limited to a finite number of states to reduce the number of computational tasks .",
    "we confirmed that the truncation does not produce any noticeable differences in the numerical results .    in our calculations ,",
    "velocity of a superfluid flow becomes quantized owing to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "however , the decay of a flow from the initial state to the lower winding number states does not occur even in a ring geometry because of the conditions we assume here , i.e. , at zero temperature without any thermal fluctuations .",
    "our system therefore essentially becomes equivalent to the non - periodic systems that are generally realized in the optical lattice experiments to observe the dynamical instability .",
    "actually , mun _",
    "et al._@xcite reported that the observed dynamical phase - diagram can be quantitatively explained by the theory based on the dynamical gutzwiller approximation which was developed by e. altman _",
    "et al._@xcite assuming the periodic boundary condition .",
    "we also note that energetic instabilities like the landau instability do not occur in our calculation because we keep the total energy in the system constant during time evolution .",
    "therefore , there is no dissipation , like the phonon in the landau instability , discharging energy to a heat bath such as external environment or a thermal component in a system .",
    "this situation is consistent with the experiments that observed the dynamical instability . as shown in ref.@xcite",
    ", energetic instabilities hardly appear in the experiments because the time scale of energetic instability is sufficiently longer than that of the dynamical instability at low temperatures where a thermal component is highly suppressed .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the instability of a superfluid flow by introducing two characteristic momenta : a critical momentum @xmath39 and a decay momentum @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath39 corresponds to the critical momentum at which a superfluid flow starts to decay under the condition that its momentum is increased _ adiabatically _ from zero in an optical lattice . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath40 is the similar critical momentum when the momentum of a superfluid is increased at a certain acceleration rate @xmath33 as in the real experiment situations .",
    "a superfluid flow actually starts to decay drastically at @xmath40 owing to the dynamical instability during time evolution governed by eq.([eom ] ) based on the dynamical gutzwiller method mentioned above . from these definitions",
    ", @xmath40 agrees with @xmath39 in the limit of @xmath41 .",
    "one can evaluate @xmath39 by the extrapolation using the values of @xmath40 at several acceleration rates , while we adopted the alternative approach mentioned below .    here",
    "we briefly explain the way we calculate @xmath39 for the spinless case as a simple example @xcite .",
    "the critical momentum @xmath39 is determined from the ( non - dimensional ) group velocity @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the density of a _ steady _ superfluid flowing with momentum @xmath44 .",
    "the periodicity of @xmath45 reflects the structure of the lowest bloch band in an optical lattice . in the framework of the gutzwiller approximation , the density @xmath43 is equivalent to the condensate fraction @xmath46 defined as the population of the state with momentum @xmath44 , where @xmath47 is the quasi - momentum of a condensate in an optical lattice .",
    "the condensate fraction @xmath48 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath44 according to the effective hopping amplitude @xmath49 given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 corresponds to the dimension of the system .",
    "consequently , the group velocity @xmath45 has a maximum at a certain momentum @xmath52 as @xmath44 is increased .",
    "beyond this @xmath53 , the effective mass , which is the inverse of the hopping amplitude in the tight binding model , becomes negative and then the sound velocity for the bhm becomes complex due to the formula @xmath54 based on the gutzwiller approximation @xcite , where @xmath55 is the superfluid density and @xmath56 is the compressibility .",
    "a superfluid flow is unstable above @xmath39 on such a mathematical background .",
    "finally , the critical momentum @xmath39 is obtained self - consistently under the condition that the group velocity achieves its maximum value : @xmath57 note that this equation is also applicable to the @xmath0 bhm .",
    "we determine the phase boundary of the dynamical instability using this @xmath39 to remove the influence of momentum acceleration rate @xmath33 , while the previous work employed @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "figure [ nkp ] shows the time - evolution of condensate fractions @xmath58 for the spin-1 ( @xmath0 ) and spinless ( @xmath59 ) bhm with filling @xmath60 and on - site repulsion @xmath61 , as functions of increasing momentum in time where @xmath62 . in the @xmath0 bhm , we set @xmath63 ( ferromagnetic ) and @xmath64 ( antiferromagnetic ) .",
    "we choose the ground state as the initial state at time @xmath65 for each @xmath32 and @xmath7 .",
    "the total @xmath66 in the system is conserved during the time evolution . from fig.[nkp ] , @xmath58 gradually decreases as the momentum @xmath29 is increased , and then suddenly decays owing to the dynamical instability .",
    "the decay momenta are correspondingly @xmath67 for @xmath63 and 0.45 for @xmath64 in the @xmath0 bhm , and 0.38 in the @xmath59 bhm .",
    "we find that the @xmath0 condensate persists to a larger @xmath29 than the @xmath59 condensate , indicating some influences of the spin - dependent interaction included in the hamiltonian eq.([hamil ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the initial condensate fraction at @xmath68 in the @xmath0 bhm with @xmath64 is almost the same as that in the @xmath59 model .",
    "moreover , even in the @xmath0 bhm , @xmath40 for @xmath64 is slightly larger than that for @xmath63 , while the condensate fraction around @xmath69 for @xmath64 is apparently smaller than that for @xmath63 .",
    "these results suggest that the amplitude of the condensate fraction does not solely determine @xmath40 , which is very consistent with the fact that the derivative @xmath70 is also included in eq.([pc ] ) for determining @xmath39 .",
    "as we briefly mentioned in the previous section , the decay momentum @xmath40 inevitably becomes larger than the critical momentum @xmath39 of eq.([pc ] ) when the system parameters are equal , i.e. , the same interaction strength , filling , and lattice geometry .",
    "our previous work in ref.@xcite showed that a superfluid can flow stably beyond the critical momentum @xmath39 until the unstable mode that causes dynamical instability fully grows .",
    "this retardation effect always exists as long as a finite acceleration of a condensate exists in calculations or experiments .",
    "we confirmed in fig.[nkp ] that @xmath40 approaches @xmath39 in the both bhms using a smaller coefficient @xmath71 for @xmath34 .",

    "the critical interactions are @xmath99 for the @xmath0 bhm and @xmath100 for the @xmath59 bhm .",
    "the cross at about @xmath101 in fig.[ferro ] ( a ) on the dashed vertical line at @xmath61 represents the decay momentum of a spin-1 superfluid flow , @xmath40 , seen in fig.[nkp ] .",

    "we examine this dynamical phase diagram in more detail . in our calculations , all spin-1 particles with ferromagnetic interaction stay in the @xmath76 state , which makes the situation relatively simple .",

    "this divergence of the phase boundaries for @xmath108 basically originates from the difference in the mott - transition points between the @xmath59 and 1 bhms . in the strongly correlated regime ,",
    "the probability of double occupation @xmath109 at each site in the @xmath0 model is much larger than that in the @xmath59 model for the same interaction strength @xmath32 owing to the formation of the local spin singlet state @xmath110 [ this formulation is defined by formula ( 23 ) in reference @xcite ] , which has the energy gain @xmath111 in the @xmath7 term .",
    "this enhanced number fluctuation leads to a larger critical interaction strength at the mott - transition point @xmath112 in the @xmath0 bhm with unit filling .",
    "correspondingly , the stable area of the @xmath0 model in the phase diagram grows compared with that of the @xmath59 system .    in fig.[antiferro](b )",

    "we examine this effect by dividing the phase diagram into two regions : a strongly correlated regime in which the phase boundaries are close together ( region 1 for @xmath117 ) and another regime in which the boundaries diverge ( region 2 for @xmath118 ) .",

    "note that , in region 1 , there is hardly any change in @xmath133 or @xmath135 irrespective of the interaction strength and the superfluid momentum , reflecting the fact that the spin state becomes stationary in this region .",
    "this result is consistent with the slight spin variation seen in fig.[time ] ( b ) .",
    "the spin mixing process does not occur in region 1 , and consequently the spin dependent @xmath7 term causes only the shift in @xmath32 as in the ferromagnetic case .",
    "we can thus understand that the phase boundaries of both the @xmath59 and 1 bhms become identical when @xmath32 is normalized by the corresponding @xmath81 as in fig.[antiferro ] ( b ) .",
    "on the other hand , in region 2 , the spin configurations become complex because the population of the @xmath136 states increases , and the spin mixing in the @xmath7 term plays a role ( fig.[spin_fra ] ( b ) ) . here",
    "we examine how the spin degrees of freedom influence the value of the critical momentum @xmath39 and discuss the origin of the divergence of the phase boundaries in region 2 seen in fig.[antiferro ] ( b ) .",

    "furthermore , in a weakly correlated regime , the condensate fractions in both the @xmath59 and 1 systems are sufficiently large and equally close to 1 .",
    "the difference between the @xmath39 values of these two systems is therefore determined largely by the @xmath140 factor in the denominator of the above relation .",
    "next we explain the influence of spins on this factor of @xmath140 .",
    "it is generally known that the effective hopping amplitude of a condensate carrying the momentum @xmath44 becomes @xmath141 .",
    "the increment in momentum hence diminishes the condensate fraction @xmath58 as is shown in fig.[nkp ] , which simultaneously reduces the number fluctuations of a condensate . in the @xmath0 bhm ,",

    "figure[spin_fra ] shows that the population of the @xmath142 state increases with increasing momentum in the weakly correlated regime , while the population of @xmath136 states decreases .",
    "this suggests that the number fluctuations in the @xmath0 system are further suppressed in order to gain an energy of @xmath111 in the @xmath7 term .",
    "therefore , in the weakly correlated regime , @xmath140 when @xmath0 is generally larger than that when @xmath59 .",

    "the @xmath0 phase boundary is located above the @xmath59 curve over the entire interaction range , which is in contrast to the phase diagram for unit filling shown in fig.[antiferro](b ) .",
    "this suggests that the unfrozen spins , which prefer the local singlet states , stabilize the superfluid flow .",

    "et al . _ calculated the dynamical phase diagram of the @xmath59 bhm with incommensurate fillings based on the gutzwiller approximation in ref.@xcite .",
    "they clarified that the critical momentum @xmath39 has a minimum value at a certain interaction strength and then asymptotically approaches @xmath157 with increase in interaction strength .",
    "the superfluidity of the extra particles becomes highly robust in the strongly interacting regime , i.e. , the superfluidity recovers owing to the repulsive interaction .",
    "the minimum of @xmath53 in the dynamical phase diagram therefore represents the crossover between weakly and strongly interacting regimes .",
    "here we analyze this tendency in the @xmath0 bhm with the antiferromagnetic interaction @xmath75 .",
    "figure[incomme ] shows the dynamical phase diagrams of the @xmath0 bhm with the filling factors deviating slightly from @xmath60 and 2 , along with diagrams of the @xmath59 bhm . from these figures ,",
    "the dynamical phase diagrams of the @xmath0 bhm at incommensurate fillings agree qualitatively with those of the spinless @xmath59 model .",
    "however , we still find the influence of the parity , which we have seen in the phase boundaries for the commensurate cases . in fig.[incomme](a ) and",
    "( b ) where the fillings are close to @xmath60 , the critical momentum reaches its minimum value at a larger interaction strength in the @xmath0 bhm in comparison with the @xmath59 results . on the other hand , in fig.[incomme](c ) and ( d ) where the fillings are close to @xmath148 , the minimum point for @xmath0 is apparently smaller than that for @xmath59 .",
    "this behavior can be roughly understood in terms of whether the formation of the local spin singlet state conceals or accentuates the extra particles .",
    "as mentioned in the commensurate case , the formation of the local singlet state enhances ( suppresses ) the density fluctuation of a condensate with the odd ( even ) fillings .",
    "the intense density fluctuation of a condensate conceals the effect of the extra particles on the left of the minimum points while the suppressed density fluctuation accentuates the extra particles on the right side .",
    "therefore , with the fillings close to @xmath60 , the extra particles are more concealed due to the formation of the local spin singlet state , and the minimum point for @xmath0 slides to the right compared to that of @xmath59 , while the extra particles are more accentuated due to the formation of the local spin singlet state and the minimum point for @xmath0 slides to the left compared with that of @xmath59 with the fillings close to @xmath148 .",
    "furthermore , we see that there is particle - hole symmetry in the dynamical phase diagrams with incommensurate fillings by noting the consistency between the @xmath158 and 1.2 results , and also between the @xmath159 and 2.2 results .    , ( b ) @xmath160 , ( c ) @xmath159 , and ( d ) @xmath161 . we employ @xmath64 in all cases for the @xmath0 model .",
    ", width=302 ]      finally , we discuss the density and spin modulation associated with the dynamical instability .",
    "a spinless superfluid flow in an optical lattice exhibits a density modulation as a precursor to dynamical instability @xcite .",
    "this is a manifestation of unstable collective excitation modes as a seed of the dynamical instability , and it depends strongly on the interaction strength or the acceleration rate of the condensate momentum @xcite .",
    "this collective excitation , which involves a lot of physical information , is significant in terms of understanding the dynamical instability .",
    "here we examine whether the occurrence of spin modulation is associated with the dynamical instability of the spin-1 condensate in the @xmath0 bhm .",
    "we again assume an antiferromagnetic system with a spin - dependent interaction strength of @xmath64 .",

    "( b ) : deviation of densities from the mean values : particle number ( light line ) and magnetization ( dark line ) .",
    "the parameters are fixed at @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath64 .",
    "these results correspond to the point at @xmath163 after the decay at @xmath164 on the solid line in fig.[nkp ] .",
    ", width=264 ]    figure[modu_nomag ] ( a ) shows the density distributions of @xmath165 components after the dynamical decay of a condensate .",
    "the density modulation develops sufficiently at this momentum .",
    "we find that the density modulations of the @xmath87 components develop in unison , and that of the @xmath88 component develops independent of those modulations .",
    "this result indicates that small spatial fluctuations in a condensate grow independently in @xmath87 components and the @xmath88 component .",
    "this is because the components of @xmath87 are equivalent in eq.([eom ] ) within the mean - field approximation where the density modulations of @xmath87 components develop in unison .",
    "figure[modu_nomag ] ( b ) shows the total density distribution and magnetization distribution at the same momentum .",
    "there is no spin modulation of the @xmath85 components while the total density modulation develops intensely .",
    "this reflects the consistent development of the modulations of the @xmath87 components .",
    "therefore , the spin modulation occurs only within the @xmath166 plane .",

    "the parameters are @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath64 as in fig[modu_nomag ] .",
    "a uniform magnetic field is used to adjust the initial populations of the spin components to @xmath167 under the condition of @xmath31 .",
    "these results correspond to the point at @xmath101 after the decay at @xmath168 as the momentum is increased such that @xmath62 .",
    ", width=264 ]    next , let us examine the spin modulation in a system with a uniform magnetic field in the @xmath169 direction . here , the @xmath87 populations become imbalanced and we adjust them to @xmath167 .",
    "figure[modu_mag ] ( a ) shows the density distributions of @xmath165 components after the dynamical decay of a condensate . a magnetic field is applied to the system only at initial state @xmath31 , but the initial state is stable since the total @xmath85 in the system is conserved .",
    "a significant difference from non - magnetic case is that the density modulations of the @xmath87 components develop independently , namely , small spatial fluctuations in a condensate grow independently in @xmath76 and @xmath162 components .",
    "this result indicates that @xmath87 components decay independently only if there is difference between the component populations . as a result",
    ", the spin modulation of @xmath85 components occurs as shown in fig.[modu_mag ] ( b ) .",
    "in this study , we analyzed the dynamical instability of a superfluid flow in the @xmath0 bhm using the gutzwiller approximations .",
    "time evolutional calculations revealed that the superfluid flow of the spin-1 condensate decays at a different critical momentum from the spinless model when the interaction strength is the same , which is due to spin - dependent interactions .",
    "furthermore , we obtained the dynamical phase diagrams of both the @xmath0 and spinless @xmath59 bhms and discussed their differences . with a ferromagnetic interaction @xmath77 , the phase diagram of the spin - polarized @xmath0 bhm",
    "becomes essentially the same as the diagram of the spinless bhm because we can appropriately renormalize the interactions . on the other hand , with an antiferromagnetic interaction @xmath9 , the dynamical phase diagrams of the @xmath0 bhm differ fundamentally from the spinless model and shed light on the influence of the spin mixing process between the @xmath0 bosons .",
    "we discussed in detail the important role of the formation of the local singlet state in the dynamical instability and the sf - mi transition in the @xmath0 bhm .",
    "our systematical study also showed that the phase diagram strongly depends on the average number of particles per site , in particular , the even - odd parity .",
    "we finally discussed the density modulation and the spin modulation associated with the dynamical instability .",
    "we found that the anisotropy of the spin modulation depends on whether or not a uniform magnetic field is present .",
    "this suggests that the spin modulation is highly sensitive to the imbalance in the spin components generated by a uniform magnetic field .",
    "some of the numerical computations were carried out at the yukawa institute computer facility and at the cyberscience center , tohoku university .",
    "this work was supported by japan society for the promotion of science kakenhi grant no .",
