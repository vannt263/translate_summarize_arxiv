    "<S> generalized hidden local symmetry ( ghls ) model is the chiral model of pseudoscalar , vector , and axial vector mesons and their interactions . </S>",

    "<S> , ghls model is confronted with the aleph data on the decay @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the invariant mass spectrum of final pions in this decay calculated in ghls framework with the single @xmath1 resonance disagrees with the experimental data at any reasonable number of free ghls parameters . </S>",
    "<S> two modifications of ghls model based on inclusion of two additional heavier axial vector mesons are studied . </S>",
    "<S> one of them giving a good description of the aleph data , with all the parameters kept free is shown to result in very large @xmath2 partial width . </S>",
    "<S> the other scheme with the ghls parameters fixed in a way that the universality is preserved and the observed central value of @xmath2 is reached , results in a good description of the three pion spectrum in @xmath3 decay . </S>"
