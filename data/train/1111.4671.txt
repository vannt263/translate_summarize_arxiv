    "the upper photon path is taken apart from the quantum interrogation interferometer in a detour .",

    "the sign shift only happens when the photon is down and there is no bomb .",
    "the most relevant part is the relative phase shift between the @xmath24 and the @xmath12 terms when the bomb state is @xmath30 , which gives the cz evolution .",
    "the existence of an upper path ( of the same length ) takes a trivial transformation and makes it significant .",

    ", any atom with a transition resonant to the photon s frequency could be used as the quantum bomb . however , unless there is a strong coupling , the probability of absorption will be small and the scheme will not function as required . for that reason , we prefer using an ensemble , which is more delicate from the point of view of coherence time , but can provide a good probability of absorption when the bomb is supposed to be absorptive . as the ensemble is only an intermediate system ,",
    "coherence time is not critical .",
    "our bomb has two parts , an ensemble in the ground state @xmath46 and a control rydberg atom in a superposition @xmath47 ( figure [ rydberg ] ) .",
    "the photons will go through the ensemble .",
    "we consider two bomb states , @xmath48 , in which the ensemble absorbs the photon with high probability , and @xmath49 , in which the excited control atom interacts with the ensemble and raises the energy level of the excited states inhibiting photon absorption ( there is a dipole blockade ) .    ]",
    "our scheme is similar to cnot gate proposals for atom ensembles @xcite .",
    "we can recycle many techniques from previous quantum information systems based on rydberg atoms @xcite .",
    "however , instead of needing an exquisite control of the atoms , we shift most of the work into the quantum interrogation part .",
    "we only need to manipulate a single rydberg atom and make it evolve from @xmath40 into @xmath47 ( for instance with a controlled rabi oscillation with a @xmath50 pulse ) .",
    "the bomb explosion ( the photon absorption ) can be a two photon resonant process assisted with a strong laser pump . in a correct operation",
    ", absorption will have a negligible probability , but it must be an efficient process .",
    "we need to guarantee the possibility of photon loss .",
    "the explosion can be amplified to the classical level , if desired , using fluorescence detection to observe whether the @xmath41 state is occupied or not @xcite .",
    "this last step is optional .",
    "quantum interrogation also works if the photons are lost to the environment when the bomb is present @xcite .",
    "this includes absorption and a later spontaneous decay or any other incoherent process .",
    "the ensemble states @xmath51 and @xmath52 are also valid absorbing and transparent bomb states . we have chosen to place the control in a single atom to avoid problems with the decay of the excited @xmath52 state .",
    "the single atom rydberg state @xmath41 is more stable and is separated from the passing photons , reducing the stimulated emission problems that could occur in the highly coupled photon - ensemble interaction .",
    "one possible implementation for the cz gate between the ensemble and the photon is shown in figure [ rydbergcz ] .",
    "this setup gives the evolution described in equations ( [ eqcz1 ] ) and ( [ eqcz2 ] ) .",

    "the cz gate of the previous section can be used to design a cz gate between the two photons .",
    "the ensemble acts as an ancillary system which can be discarded after the operation .",
    "we start with two photons , a control photon in any superposition @xmath53 and a target photon in state @xmath54 .",
    "the photonic cz gate has six stages :    1 .",
    "we initialize the bomb state to @xmath55 acting on the control atom .",
    "if it is originally in the @xmath40 state , we can apply a @xmath50 pulse .",
    "we direct the control photon into the ensemble inside the quantum interrogation setup .",
    "the joint state of the bomb and the control photon goes from @xmath56 to @xmath57 3 .",
    "we apply a @xmath50 pulse on the control atom to get the state @xmath58 the state of the control photon is now associated to the transparency of the bomb .",
    "control logical @xmath59 becomes associated to an absorbing bomb , logical @xmath60 to a transparent bomb .",
    "we direct the target photon to the quantum interrogation setup with the ensemble .",

    "we apply a @xmath50 pulse on the control atom .",
    "now we have @xmath62 6 .",
    "we measure the state of the control rydberg atom . if it is found in state @xmath40 , we already have the desired state @xmath63 + if @xmath41 is found , there is a sign shift in the terms associated to control logical @xmath60 .",
    "this can be corrected with a @xmath11 phase shifter in the lower path of the control photon .",
    "the phase shifter can be controlled with a driver connected to the measurement results .",
    "after the sixth step , the photons are entangled and independent from the rydberg atoms .",
    "we already have a gate which enables universal quantum computation with photons .",
    "the advantage of using a quantum interrogation scheme is that the degree of control on the ensemble can be limited .",
    "absorption only happens in the case of failure and being able to keep the coherence of the @xmath52 state is irrelevant . the number of operations on the atomic part is likewise reduced .",
    "we only need to provide a suitable @xmath50 pulse for the control atom and a measurement system .",
    "the quantum interrogation approach shifts the problems to other areas .",
    "the most important obstacles are obtaining a good blockade , imperfect absorption and optical losses .",
    "we need a system showing a sufficiently strong dipole blockade so that the @xmath30 bomb state is truly transparent .",
    "there has been enough experimental development in that area to guarantee at least a high transparency @xcite .",
    "small errors are not critical",
    ". we can monitor the system to find any residual absorption ( bomb explosion ) .",
    "protocol failures are heralded by a populated @xmath52 state , which can be observed .",
    "as long as the total probability of failure is kept small , we can just repeat the gate until we succeed .",
    "imperfect absorption is another potential problem .",
    "we have described a system where the probability of photon absorption is 1 for the @xmath29 bomb state .",
    "the real probability of absorption is limited by the photon - ensemble coupling . however ,",
    "less than perfect absorption can be tolerated .",
    "there are different analyses of quantum interrogation of partially absorbing objects @xcite .",
    "they all predict the same asymptotic behaviour as in the case with a perfect absorber at the cost of increasing the number of cycles @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , if the alternative bomb state is perfectly transparent , we can simply readjust the beamsplitters to recover perfect operation @xcite .",
    "losses pose a bigger challenge . even for small optical losses , the number of stages before serious degradation",
    "is greatly reduced @xcite .",
    "a smaller @xmath16 can affect the final probability of success .",
    "a practical implementation of the proposed gate must achieve a delicate balance between losses and good absorption .",
    "optically dense media with a higher interaction can increase the probability of loosing a photon when it must be preserved .",
    "we have proposed an entangling gate for photons which , in combination with linear optics quantum gates , would allow to perform any quantum algorithm .",
    "the gate is based on the quantum interrogation of an atomic ensemble which can be in a superposition of being transparent and opaque to the photons .",
    "the transparency is turned on and off by manipulating a single rydberg atom . if the atom is excited , it blocks absorption in the ensemble ( the bomb is defused ) .",
    "the interaction between the photons and the ensemble is based on the possibility of absorption , even though it never materializes during the correct operation of the gate .",
    "the main obstacle for a scalable quantum computer with such a counterfactual gate is achieving an optical system in which loss and absorption effects are properly balanced .",
    "while there are many additional technical difficulties , systems similar to the one proposed have been experimentally used for counterfactual interaction - free protocols with good results @xcite .",
    "we believe that , even though the scheme can be refined , the implementation of , at least , the cz gate between a single photon and the rydberg atom system is feasible with the current technology .",
