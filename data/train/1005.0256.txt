    "deviation of an observed genus curve from equation  [ eq : grgenus ] indicates the non - gaussian signal .",

    "deviations in the shape of the genus curve from the theoretical random phase case can be quantified by the following three variables : @xmath59 @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the genus of the best - fit gaussian curve ( eq .",
    "3 ) . thus @xmath4 measures any shift in the central portion of the genus curve . the gaussian curve ( eq .",

    "@xmath5 and @xmath63 measure the observed number of voids and ( super ) clusters relative to those expected from the best - fitting gaussian curve .",

    "one might want to fix the amplitude using the observed power spectrum and the relation between the power spectrum and the amplitude of a gaussian genus curve ( given just after eq .",
    "the power spectrum measured from an observational sample also has statistical uncertainties , which propagate to the uncertainty in the amplitude of the genus curve .",
    "furthermore , the genus versus power spectrum relation in the case of gaussian fields can not be directly applied to non - gaussian fields in general .",
    "we also want to separate the non - gaussianity seen in the genus curve due to the amplitude drop from that due to the deviation of the genus curve from the gaussian shape , and this is best done when the observed genus curve is compared with a gaussian curve with their amplitudes matched together .",

    "figure  [ gplot ] shows that the observed genus curve deviates from the gaussian one in such a way that the genus at high thresholds has smaller amplitude .",
    "this means there are fewer voids and fewer superclusters when compared with the gaussian genus curve . in other words , voids and superclusters",
    "are more connected and their sizes are larger than those expected for gaussian fields . in addition , the positive ( @xmath75 ) region of the genus curve is slightly but systematically shifted towards lower @xmath50 values , and the percolation of large - scale structure ( maximum @xmath76 ) occurs slightly below @xmath77 . according to the perturbation theory prediction of matsubara ( 1994 ) , if there were only non - linear gravitational effects involved , with no biasing , then one should find @xmath78 at all scales ( park et al . 2005 ) , and the n - body results presented for dark matter in figure  [ sys ] below are consistent with this expectation .",
    "since the observed @xmath5 and @xmath63 are both less than @xmath79 , it shows that biasing effects are involved .",
    "the genus curve in figure  [ gplot ] is affected by peculiar velocity distortions , boundary effects , and finite sampling of the density field . however , using detailed comparisons to mock catalogs from cosmological simulations , we will show that the deviations from the gaussian field prediction , and indeed from the expected non - linear matter density field , are genuine , and statistically significant .",

    "the least inconsistent model is hgc , followed by the hod model , while the three sam models are the most inconsistent .",
    "these discrepancies confirm the findings of gott et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , using the dr3 topology measurement and several n - body and hydrodynamic simulations , that existing galaxy formation models do not reproduce the topology of the sdss main galaxy sample near the smoothing scales we are exploring .",
    "it is interesting to note that the hgc performs best among the five galaxy formation models even though it is constrained by only one observational parameter , the mean galaxy number density .",
    "on the other hand , gott , choi , & park ( 2009 ) found that the topology of the luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) is successfully fit by the hgc model we have tested here , which means that for the most massive galaxies , the hgc model does seem to work well .",
    "thus the formation of the most massive lrgs seems to be a cleaner problem that can be modeled with cdm simulations and sub - halo finding routines like those described by kim & park ( 2006 ) .",
    "there are several implications that can be obtained from this test on how to fix these galaxy formation prescriptions to make them reproduce the observed galaxy clustering topology .",
    "the sam models and hod model should be modified so that the mock galaxies do not separate voids  connecting low density regions would lower @xmath5 .",
    "the sam models should also produce more connected massive clusters ( i.e. smaller @xmath63 ) .",
    "all models should produce large - scale structure percolating at lower density levels ( i.e. more negative @xmath4 ) .",
    "the problems with the sam models might be alleviated if the threshold interval for galaxy formation were more narrow ( i.e. , fewer galaxies in low mass halos ) , making voids cleaner and superclusters denser .    in principle , of course , the discrepancies in figure  [ gplotgfm ] could be a sign of non - gaussian initial conditions , or of a linear power spectrum very different from the one we have adopted based on wmap3 .",
    "however , given that different galaxy formation prescriptions produce differences comparable in magnitude to the observed discrepancies , even though no one model matches all aspects of the observed topology , we are inclined to ascribe these discrepancies to imperfect galaxy formation physics .",
    "the dependence of topology on galaxy morphology and color also supports this interpretation , as the differences between the topology of early- and late - type galaxy subsets are larger than the discrepancies between the full galaxy sample and the observations .",
    "the sam models give not only luminosity but also color of mock galaxies , which makes it possible to compare the observation and sam models using the samples divided by color .",
    "we adjust the lower limit of galaxy luminosity to make the mean galaxy separation @xmath134 equal to that of the sdss galaxies in the volume - limited samples with @xmath135 ( sample l2 ) and @xmath136 ( sample l1 ) .",

    "the short - dashed line in the top panel of figure  [ sys ] is the genus curve averaged over these 27 samples .",
    "it can be seen that the radial boundary and angular selection effects introduce little change in the genus curve in the case of the main part of sdss dr7 thanks to the large volume - to - surface ratio and high and uniform angular selection function of the sample .",
    "a large bias in the genus curve is generated when galaxies are observed in redshift space .",
    "the red line in the top panel of figure  [ sys ] is the case when both rsd effects and the effects due to survey boundaries and angular selection function are taken into account in the 27 mock sdss dr7 surveys .",
    "the difference between red line and dashed line is due to the rsd effects .",
    "the amplitude of the genus curve is decreased mostly due to the smoothing of structure by small - scale peculiar velocities of galaxies , but its shape does not change much . the genus curve near the median - volume threshold @xmath177 is slightly pushed to the negative threshold direction , thus making @xmath4 decrease . both the number of clusters and voids are decreased .",
    "the number of high density regions is decreased more because massive clusters of galaxies are strongly clustered with one another and two clusters often appear connected along the line - of - sight in redshift space . on the other hand ,",
    "a void can be affected when strong fingers - of - god protrude into the void from surrounding clusters in redshift space .",
    "the number of voids is decreased only a little between the blue and red lines in the top panel of figure  [ sys ] because it is difficult for voids identified on @xmath176mpc scale to be erased by this process .",
    "but the number of voids relative to those expected from the best - fitting gaussian curve ( @xmath5 ) is rather increased .",
    "it is also interesting to know how the genus curve depends on the type of the density tracer .",
    "a comprehensive study on this issue has been made by park , kim & gott ( 2005 ) , who used a set of n - body simulations of @xmath6cdm and the standard cold dark matter universe to examine the dependence of the genus curve on gravitational evolution , biasing , rsd , smoothing scale , and cosmology . in the middle panel of figure  [ sys ]",

    "<S> we measure the topology of the main galaxy distribution using the seventh data release of the sloan digital sky survey , examining the dependence of galaxy clustering topology on galaxy properties . </S>",
    "<S> the observational results are used to test galaxy formation models . </S>",
    "<S> a volume - limited sample defined by @xmath0 enables us to measure the genus curve with amplitude of @xmath1 at @xmath2mpc smoothing scale , with 4.8% uncertainty including all systematics and cosmic variance . </S>",
    "<S> the clustering topology over the smoothing length interval from 6 to @xmath3mpc reveals a mild scale - dependence for the shift ( @xmath4 ) and void abundance ( @xmath5 ) parameters of the genus curve . </S>",
    "<S> we find substantial bias in the topology of galaxy clustering with respect to the predicted topology of the matter distribution , which varies with luminosity , morphology , color , and the smoothing scale of the density field . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of relatively brighter galaxies shows a greater prevalence of isolated clusters and more percolated voids . even though early ( late)-type galaxies show topology similar to that of red ( blue ) galaxies , the morphology dependence of topology is not identical to the color dependence . in particular , the void abundance parameter @xmath5 depends on morphology more strongly than on color . </S>",
    "<S> we test five galaxy assignment schemes applied to cosmological n - body simulations of a @xmath6cdm universe to generate mock galaxies : the halo - galaxy one - to - one correspondence model , the halo occupation distribution model , and three implementations of semi - analytic models ( sams ) . </S>",
    "<S> none of the models reproduces all aspects of the observed clustering topology ; the deviations vary from one model to another but include statistically significant discrepancies in the abundance of isolated voids or isolated clusters and the amplitude and overall shift of the genus curve . </S>",
    "<S> sam predictions of the topology color - dependence are usually correct in sign but incorrect in magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> our topology tests indicate that , in these models , voids should be emptier and more connected , and the threshold for galaxy formation should be at lower densities . </S>"
