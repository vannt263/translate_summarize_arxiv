    "electron scattering in graphene is still a debated matter ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the situation is complicated in this 2-dimensional crystal by the strong influences of the substrate , the surface contamination , the effects of static distortions and phonons @xcite . by contrast",
    "investigation technics are rather limited ; the main diagnosis relies on the temperature and carrier density ( @xmath1 ) dependencies of the conductivity .",
    "the former is weak for graphene on substrates and attributed to phonons @xcite .",
    "the later comes from the dependence of the scattering time @xmath2 on wave number which can be varied in a broad range due to efficient electrostatic gate doping . we have listed in table-[table1 ] the most predicted behaviors for the @xmath2 and the corresponding @xmath3 laws @xcite .",
    "they can be classified in two categories corresponding to a nearly linear density dependence of the conductivity ( or @xmath4 ) , or a constant conductivity ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the former is exemplified by the charge impurity mechanism and the latter by the local impurity model .",
    "intermediate situations can be explained by an admixture of both mechanisms giving rise to a sublinear density dependence of conductivity .",
    "alternatively sublinearity could be accounted for by a single mechanism , like the dirac - mass disorder associated with a random lifting of sublattice degeneracy @xcite . indeed , according to ref.@xcite",
    ", a random dirac - mass mechanism should give @xmath6 .",
    "it translates into a @xmath7 dependence of the bulk conductivity , which should not be confused with the @xmath8 dependence of a two terminal conductance in ballistic graphene @xcite .",

    "@xmath39 is the thermal average of @xmath36 and corresponds to the electronic compressibility , @xmath40 where @xmath41 . the finite compressibility is responsible for a chemical contribution @xmath42 in addition to the electrostatic one in the electronic charging energy . for a capacitor charge @xmath43 and bias @xmath44",

    "the use of high resistivity silicon is important to minimize the spurious conductance through the substrate .",
    "this parasitic contribution can be very high at microwave frequencies , and effectively shunt the contribution of a small graphene sample .",

    "we stress that the 1-dimensional character of the rf probing field penetrating the capacitor should not be confused with the 2-dimensional electronic diffusion probed by the rf field .",
    "this 1d field distribution is a powerful simplification in the analysis of the capacitor response as compared to the more complicated 2-dimensional current distribution in a high frequency drain - source conductivity measurement .    the low frequency development",
    ", @xmath101 gives the equivalent r - c circuit description which corresponds to an homogeneous charge distribution with a capacitance , @xmath102 , and a resistance , @xmath103 .",
    "eq.([low_freq ] ) will be used for the experimental determination of @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",

    "it is markedly different from that of an rc circuit with a frequency independent charging resistance , such as a contact resistance @xmath110 which gives @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "the observation of the asymptotic skin effect regime given by eq.([high_freq ] ) will be taken as a proof that the measured conductivity is the bulk contribution equivalent to that measured in a four terminal dc experiment .",
    "the crossing of real and imaginary parts at @xmath113 defines the cutoff frequency of the capacitor .",
    "it can be expressed as the sum @xmath114 .",
    "the first term is the cutoff of a classical capacitor , the second is a mesoscopic correction due to the finite density of state .",
    "the correction dominates at charge neutrality and low temperature in top gated devices ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "one can note that in these conditions , @xmath116 becomes a rather direct measurement of the diffusion constant , which is a further example of a mesoscopic effect where a microscopic property ( the thouless energy @xmath117 ) shows up in a macroscopic measurement ( the cutoff frequency of a capacitor ) .    as shown in fig.[admittance ] , both regimes are observed in experiment with a cutoff that increases with carrier density and levels off at @xmath118 at neutrality ( see fig.[cutoff ] ) . in particular , the full spectrum of eq.([yg ] ) can be verified at low hole doping demonstrating the prominent contribution of diffusion in charge relaxation . in the analysis we have also included the effect of the access region as a serial resistance @xmath81 .",
    "we approximate @xmath119 .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath81 results in a small correction in the investigated frequency range , but becomes prominent at very high frequency with an asymptotic limit @xmath120 and @xmath121 for @xmath122 . in order to quantify the effect of @xmath81 we have added in fig.[admittance ]  ( b ) ( dashed line ) the spectrum obtained taking @xmath123 .",
    "sample c7-f shows similar spectra with , however , a higher cutoff due to larger diffusion constant and smaller gate length .    from the fits of the full set of admittance spectra we obtain the gate capacitance @xmath124 and the conductance @xmath125 as function of gate voltage as displayed in fig.[capacitance ] .",
    "the capacitance and the conductance show a broad minimum at @xmath126 ( sample e9-zc ) and @xmath127 ( sample c7-f ) which we have identified as the charge neutrality point , shifted from zero by chemical doping .",
    "the solid lines are theoretical expectations for @xmath128 with @xmath129 and the finite temperature expression in eq.([cq ] ) .",
    "deviation from theory at low carrier density in fig.[capacitance ] is likely due to inhomogeneity in the chemical doping which is not taken into account in eq.([cq ] ) .",
    "indeed it is more pronounced in sample e9-zc which has a larger doping .",
    "the fit at large density gives an accurate determination of the geometrical capacitance @xmath130 ( sample e9-zc ) and @xmath131 ( sample c7-f ) in agreement with the rough estimates from geometry . in the following @xmath132",
    "is subtracted from @xmath133 to obtain @xmath134 .",
    "@xmath135 shows an excess at large electron density ( @xmath136 ) which can be estimated from the difference of the measured resistance to the electron - hole symmetric expectation ( dotted guide line in fig.[capacitance ] ) .",
    "we assign this difference to the contact resistance due to the formation of a p - n junction in the access region with @xmath137 .",
    "this value is consistent with theoretical expectation and experiment @xcite .",
    "we also checked that the effect of @xmath110 is also seen in the corresponding admittance spectra ( not shown ) with an increase in the series resistance at large @xmath84 .",
    "for this reason the electron regime is thereafter disregarded .",
    "the gate conductance @xmath125 depicted in fig.[capacitance ] is similar to the drain source conductance measured in graphene transistors of similar size .",
    "the order of magnitude of the mobility ( @xmath138 at @xmath139 ) is also typical of room temperature behavior @xcite .",
    "relying on the overall good quantitative agreement of the admittance spectra with the 1d rf field model and that of the gate voltage dependence of the capacitance , we proceed below to the quantitative analysis and deduce in fig.[scattering ] the diffusion constant @xmath140 from the ratio @xmath141 of the measured quantum capacitance @xmath134 to the charging resistance @xmath142 . in both cases",
    "we observe a linear dependence @xmath143 which corresponds to an energy - independent diffusion constant @xmath144 ( sample e9-zc ) and @xmath145 ( sample c7-f ) and scattering times @xmath146 .",
    "this corresponds to scattering lengths @xmath147 and @xmath148 in agreement with standard estimates @xcite .    using the experimental @xmath149 and eq.([e_f ] )",
    "we can plot @xmath54 and @xmath27 in fig.[mu_plots ] .",
    "small deviations from the theoretical estimate for @xmath39 in eq.([cq ] ) are observed in both samples which are due to experimental uncertainties and disorder contribution .",
    "uncertainties are yet too large for a quantitative estimate of the disorder contribution .",
    "the precision of the high - frequency compressibility measurement can be increased by using larger flakes ( more accurate deembedding ) , thinner gate oxide ( smaller electrostatic gate impedance ) and working at low temperatures ( larger contrast in @xmath39 ) .",
    "the conductivity data merely follow the density of states reflecting the fact that @xmath150",
    "we have observed a strong sublinear dependence of conductivity in a broad carrier density range at room temperature .",
    "direct comparison between conductivity and compressibility in the capacitor geometry at room temperature shows that this sublinear behavior extends to the low density limit and is well described by an energy - independent scattering time or equivalently @xmath151 .",
    "this result deviates from standard low temperature behavior ( @xmath4 ) explained by charged impurity , resonant scattering models , or standard ripples .",
    "it could be accounted in a ripple scenario by taking a peculiar value for the correlation exponent , @xmath152 , which deviates from standard expectation @xmath153 @xcite .",
    "another possible mechanism , less discussed in the literature , would be dirac - mass disorder proposed in ref.@xcite and characterized , according to a numerical calculation , by @xmath154 ( @xmath6 ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "our rf admittance measurement of graphene capacitors provides new insight into the energy dependence of the transport scattering time .",
    "we report on a new behavior in top gated graphene at room temperature characterized by a density independent scattering time .",
    "our experiment gives also access to the electronic compressibility via the quantum capacitance in fair agreement with theory .",
    "it can be implemented at low temperatures using a cryogenic probe station and used to characterize the different scattering mechanisms in more detail .",
    "our study may also prove useful for the design of high frequency graphene transistors .",
