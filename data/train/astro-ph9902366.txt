    "the extraplanar gas component has considerably higher ionization than the disk gas , and appears roughly distributed into two opposed radiation cones that emanate from the nucleus ( pogge 1988 ; falcke et al .",
    "detailed spectroscopic studies strongly suggest that this component is mainly ionized by photons from the nuclear continuum ( pogge 1988 ; colina 1992 ; petitjean & duret 1993 ) .",
    "several origins of this extraplanar gas component have been suggested : ( 1 ) it is tidal debris from a past interaction with another galaxy ( pogge 1988 ) ; ( 2 ) supernovae have ejected it into the halo of the galaxy ( e.g. , corbin et al .",
    "1988 ) ; ( 3 ) ram pressure from the icm has elevated some of it from the disk ( petit - jean & durret 1993 ) ; ( 4 ) it has been ejected from the nucleus by the mechanism that is powering the radio jet ( e.g. , corbin et al .",

    "order separating filters with a flat - topped transmission profile centered at 6614   ( 55   fwhm ) and 5030   ( 36   fwhm ) passed only one etalon order so true emission line profiles of h@xmath0 and [ o  iii ] @xmath15007 could be synthesized .",
    "wavelength calibration exposures were made of diffuse neon ( h@xmath0 cube ) and mercury - cadmium ( [ o  iii ] cube ) sources .",
    "a current - stabilized , flat continuum source served to flatfield the images .",
    "finally , the photometric standard stars hd 94808 , @xmath19 hya , and @xmath20 vir were observed through the same setup as the object to provide an absolute flux calibration .",
    "these data were reduced using the methods described in bland & tully ( 1989 ) , veilleux et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , and bland - hawthorn ( 1995 ) . however , the h@xmath0 data suffered from several cosmetic defects associated with the aging gec ccd . while only a fixed bias offset needed to be subtracted from the [ o  iii ] data , row - by - row bias subtraction was done on each h@xmath0 frame to remove vertical striations of the bias pattern .",
    "after interpolating over the columns with poor charge transfer , the images of each night were stacked in a cube in increasing order of wavelength .",
    "each data set was flatfielded using a similarly constructed whitelight cube .",
    "this method produced good flat fields for the [ o  iii ] spectra .",
    "large - scale illumination gradients in the sky background that persisted in the corrected h@xmath0 cube were removed by dividing the spectra by a spatially smoothed sky frame .",

    "the photometric accuracy resulting from this method is discussed in  3.1 .",
    "the rest of the reductions was the same for both h@xmath0 and [ o  iii ] cubes : spatial registration of the frames , cosmic ray removal , correction for air mass variations , sky continuum and line subtraction , correction for the curvature of the isovelocity surfaces ( `` phase calibration '' ) , and flux calibration .",
    "the oh sky line at 6604.13   ( osterbrock & martel 1992 ) was also used for the velocity calibration of the h@xmath0 data .    for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "the observed emission - line profiles were approximated by simple gaussian functions ( regions where the emission - line profiles differ from a simple gaussian will be discussed in  3.2 ) .",
    "the best fits were determined by the least - chi - squared method on spectrally smoothed emission line profiles using a 1/4  1/2  1/4 spectral filter ( hanning smoothing ) .",
    "gaussian smoothing of each image with @xmath21 = 1.0 pixel improved the sensitivity to fainter features . in the end , the centroid , intensity , and width were successfully derived from @xmath2 5,000 h@xmath0 spectra and @xmath2 7,000 [ o  iii ] @xmath15007 spectra .",
    "figure 1 presents the distributions of h@xmath0 and [ o  iii ] @xmath15007 line emission that we derived from the gaussian fits ; the underlying starlight has been removed .",
    "the 1-@xmath21 detection limit of our data corresponds to a surface brightness of @xmath2 7 and 3 @xmath14 10@xmath22 erg @xmath16 s@xmath4 arcsec@xmath23 for h@xmath0 and [ o  iii ] @xmath15007 , respectively .",
    "the flux calibration of our data cubes was checked against published long - slit spectrophotometry ( e.g. , pogge 1988 ; and petitjean & durret 1993 ) .",
    "the h@xmath0 and [ o  iii ] fluxes agree with published ones to within @xmath2 25  50% .",
    "note that the h@xmath0 and [ o  iii ] fluxes were not corrected for galactic reddening because extinction is negligible toward ngc  4388 [ e(b  v ) = 0.028 ; burstein & heiles 1978 , 1984 ] .",
    "the patchy dust lanes running roughly east - west in the optical continuum images of this galaxy ( e.g. , phillips & malin 1982 ) suggest highly variable internal extinction which may affect the apparent distribution of the ionized gas near the galactic plane .",
    "no attempt was made to correct for this effect .",
    "dilution of the h@xmath0 fluxes by underlying balmer absorption is negligible in ngc  4388 .",
    "moreover , the balmer absorption profile is dominated by pressure broadening in the atmospheres of early - type stars , making this feature indistinguishable from a slowly varying continuum over the narrow spectral bandpass of our instrument .",
    "the most prominent features in the h@xmath0 image are the strings of h  ii regions in the shape of two ` spiral arms ' within the disk of the galaxy .",
    "strong h@xmath0 disk emission is detected out to @xmath2 5 kpc east of the nucleus ( its extent is limited by the velocity coverage of our data cube ) .",

    "emission near the detection limit of our h@xmath0 data is observed projected north of the plane of the disk along pa = 20@xmath8  50@xmath8 and 1  4 kpc from the nucleus .",
    "in contrast , the [ o  iii ] map is dominated by nuclear line emission . emission from the spiral arms and from gas above the galaxy disk is also visible but considerably fainter .",
    "its large projected @xmath7z@xmath7 distance implies that the gas is well above the plane of this highly inclined ( @xmath27 = 78@xmath8 @xmath28 1@xmath8 ; cf .  3.2 ) galaxy .",
    "if this gas was in the disk , it would lie @xmath2 20 kpc from the nucleus which greatly exceeds the visible radius of the galaxy ( @xmath29 = 14 kpc from de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "the differences between the h@xmath0 and [ o  iii ] line emission distributions is particularly evident in figure 2 , which maps the [ o  iii]/h@xmath0 flux ratios .",
    "this map fundamentally compares the ionization level of the line - emitting gas .",
    "energies of 35.5 ev and 54.9 ev are needed to produce o@xmath30 and o@xmath31 , i.e. significantly larger than the 13.6 ev needed to ionize hydrogen .",
    "uncertainties on ratios range from 25% in the bright h  ii regions in the disk to @xmath950% in the fainter high-@xmath7z@xmath7 gas ( recall that the extraplanar h@xmath0 emission is near the detection limit of the data ) .",
    "the low - ionization gas is found in the bright h  ii regions of the spiral arms .",
    "these h  ii regions have [ o  iii ] @xmath15007/h@xmath0 ratios of @xmath20.1 , typical of star - forming regions with low ionization temperature ( @xmath2 40,000 k ; evans & dopita 1985 ) or high metal abundance ( o / h @xmath2 3 @xmath14 o / h@xmath32 ; mccall , rybski , & shields 1985 ) .",
    "the high - ionization gas concentrates into two regions north and south of the nucleus .",
    "the southern extension has a conical shape with apex near the nucleus .",
    "typical values for the [ o  iii ] @xmath15007/h@xmath0 ratio in the nucleus and in the ionization cones are 1 to 5 , consistent with photoionization by the agn ( pogge 1988 ; colina 1992 ; petitjean & durret 1993 ) .",
    "this ionization map is qualitatively similar to previously published [ o  iii ] @xmath15007/(h@xmath0 + [ n  ii ] @xmath336548 , 6583 ) ratio maps obtained with narrow - band interference filters ( pogge 1988 ; corbin et al .",

    "note , however , that the present line ratio map was derived directly from our spectra and is therefore not subject to the large uncertainties in the line separation and continuum subtraction which often affect line ratio maps derived from narrow - band images .      figure 3 presents the barycentric velocity fields that are derived from the h@xmath0 and [ o  iii ] @xmath15007 spectra ; uncertainties range from @xmath220 km s@xmath4 in the bright line - emitting regions to @xmath34100 km s@xmath4 in the fainter areas .",
    "the overall velocity field of the [ o  iii]-emitting gas resembles that of the h@xmath0-emitting gas . in both",
    ", the velocity field in the disk is characterized by a large - scale east - west gradient indicative of rotation in the plane of the disk .",

    "1997 ) .",
    "figure 3 shows a kinematic dichotomy between the disk gas and the extraplanar gas .",
    "to more objectively identify which portion of the line - emitting gas does not partake in disk rotation , we have constructed kinematic models to simulate the observed velocity field in the disk .",
    "these models are described in more detail in vbc .",
    "because the focus of the present paper is on the origin of the extraplanar gas in ngc  4388 , only the main results of our analysis of the disk velocity field will be discussed here .    to minimize possible effects of the active nucleus , our analysis of the disk component focused on the h@xmath0 velocity field . to summarize our results , figure 4",
    "compares the observed h@xmath0 velocity field with our best - fitting axisymmetric disk model and our best - fitting disk model that includes bar streaming motions .",
    "compared to the model with purely circular motions , the velocity residuals from the model incorporting elliptical streaming are significantly smaller throughout the disk .",
    "the residuals have a symmetric gaussian distribution with dispersion of only 10 km s@xmath4 .",
    "this is an excellent fit considering that hydrodynamic effects ( e.g. , strong shocks along the bar ; athanassoula 1992 ; piner , stone , & teuben 1995 ) are ignored in our simple kinematic model .",
    "the parameters of the model with elliptical streaming are listed in table 1 and discussed in more detail in vbc .",
    "the strong bar streaming motions prevented us from deriving a rotation curve directly from the data ; instead , we used a smooth parametric function to model the rotation curve ( cf .",
    "eqn . 3 in vbc ) .",
    "note that the inclination of the disk , @xmath36 , implies that the north rim of the disk is the near side ( i.e. we are looking at the galaxy from under the disk ) .",
    "our kinematic model suggests that most of the gas in the disk of ngc  4388 partakes in bar - forced orbital motion around the nucleus .",
    "there are , however , two notable exceptions .",
    "the h@xmath0 and [ o  iii]-emitting gas with r @xmath34 1.2 kpc and pa = 10@xmath8  70@xmath8 has velocities which appear blueshifted by 75  250 km s@xmath4 relative to systemic velocity .",
    "the location and velocity field of this gas implies that it is elevated above the disk of the galaxy .",
    "no obvious kinematic trends with height above the disk or with galactocentric radius are seen in the ne complex",
    ". however , a correlation appears to exist between the velocity field and the surface brightness of the gas in the ne complex .",

    "double - peaked [ o  iii ] profiles with velocity splitting @xmath2140 km s@xmath4 are seen near the north - east edge of that cloud .",
    "the much fainter gas directly east of this ne cloud has velocities which average 175 km s@xmath4 larger ( 75 km s@xmath4 relative to systemic ) than that of the cloud .",
    "the trend between surface brightness and blueshifted velocities is also seen in the cloud complex at r @xmath6 3.3 kpc and pa @xmath6 35@xmath8 .",
    "here , the brighter clouds have velocities which are @xmath2 60  100 km s@xmath4 more blueshifted than the diffuse gas surrounding them .",
    "the bright [ o  iii ] cloud south - west of the nucleus at r @xmath6 1.8 kpc and pa = 215@xmath8 also has anomalous velocities relative to the disk .",
    "this cloud is not detected at h@xmath0 , implying [ o  iii ]  @xmath15007/h@xmath0 @xmath34 5 .",
    "substructures ( shoulders , line splitting ) of order @xmath2 200 km s@xmath4 are seen in the emission - line profiles on the north - east side of that cloud ( also detected by corbin et al .",
    "a comparison with the modeled disk velocity field indicates that this cloud has an average redshift of @xmath2 100  150 km s@xmath4 relative to the underlying disk gas . such supersonic motion through the disk ism",
    "is highly unlikely ; therefore , this cloud is probably in front of the disk .",
    "its radial velocity relative to systemic is only @xmath2 20  30 km s@xmath4 .",
    "contrary to petitjean & durret ( 1993 ) , we see no general trend for gas at large radii to have negative velocities relative to the galaxy rotation .",
    "the probable origin of this discrepancy is the use of different kinematic models to reproduce the observed velocity field .",
    "as we demonstrated in  3.1 , elliptical streaming is important in the disk of ngc  4388 but this effect was not incorporated in the axisymmetric models of petitjean & durret ( 1993 ) .",
    "we feel that the complete two - dimensional coverage of our spectra and our use of slightly more sophisticated models put our conclusions on a more solid basis .",

    "the acceleration distance , @xmath97 , required to increase the approaching velocity of the gas in the ne cloud from 250 km s@xmath4 to 350 km s@xmath4 is approximately @xmath175 where @xmath176 = 350 km s@xmath4 , @xmath177 = 250 km s@xmath4 , and @xmath178 and @xmath179 are time - averaged quantities . using @xmath92 @xmath6 20 m@xmath32 and @xmath94 @xmath6 10 pc for typical extraplanar line - emitting clouds [ i.e. , @xmath73 @xmath6 1 @xmath38 and @xmath94 @xmath6 @xmath94(hi cloud ) ] , we get @xmath97 @xmath6 6 kpc .",
    "this is significantly larger than the 2  3 kpc separation between the ne cloud and the rest of the ne complex at higher @xmath7z@xmath7 .",
    "the implication is that the ram pressure exerted by the shocked icm has only a small effect on the kinematics of the outflowing extraplanar material .",
    "we conclude this section on a more speculative note by suggesting that the impact of the shocked icm on the galaxy and the extraplanar gas component may also be cushioned by a gaseous halo in hydrostatic equilibrium around ngc  4388 .",
    "as we discussed in  4.2.4 , a static gaseous halo in ngc  4388 would also help to explain possible shock structures in the ne and sw clouds and the curvature of the radio jet . our own galaxy",
    "is known to be surrounded by a hot ( @xmath2 10@xmath87 k ) highly ionized corona extending out to several kpc from the galactic plane ( e.g. , spitzer 1990 ; sembach & savage 1992 ; wang 1992 ) .",
    "quasar absorption - line studies ( e.g. , lanzetta et al .",
    "1995 ) and deep x - ray images of spiral and elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , fabbiano 1988 ; heckman et al .",
    "1990 ; dahlem et al .",
    "1996 ) show similar gaseous halos .",
    "the main question is whether such halos survive long enough in the virgo cluster environment .",
    "current soft x - ray images of ngc  4388 ( e.g. , matt et al . 1994 ; angelo antonelli , matt , & piro 1997 ; iwasawa et al .",
    "1997 ; colbert et al .",
    "1998 ) show soft x - ray emission of thermal origin , but the exact morphology of the x - ray gas is ill - defined because of the strong x - ray background from the virgo icm and the distorted halo in nearby m86 ( forman et al .",
    "1979 ; white et al . 1991 ; rangarajan et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the very existence of this halo in m86 , a giant e / s0 galaxy which is located close to the virgo cluster core ( 15.7 mpc according to jacoby et al . 1990 or 18.4",
    "mpc according to tonry et al .",
    "1990 ) and is moving at a velocity @xmath2 1,300 km s@xmath4 relative to the cluster ( @xmath78 = 227 km  s@xmath4 ; jacoby et al .",
    "1990 ) , gives us some confidence that at least some galaxies in virgo [ albeit those more massive than ngc  4388 : m(m86 ) @xmath6 10@xmath180 m@xmath32 ; e.g. , forman et al .",
    "1979 ] can keep an x - ray halo while experiencing virtually the same ram pressure as that on ngc  4388 .",
    "the complete two - dimensional coverage of our fabry - perot spectra on the line - emitting gas in ngc  4388 has allowed us to separate kinematically the extraplanar and disk gas components .",
    "we find that the velocity field of the high-@xmath7z@xmath7 gas is best described by a bipolar outflow rather than ram - pressure stripping by the fast - moving icm in the virgo cluster .",
    "we argue for a mach cone with opening angle @xmath2 80@xmath8 to explain these results .",
    "unfortunately , this mach cone will be difficult to detect , even with axaf and xmm , because it is predicted to be roughly face - on and the strong x - ray background from nearby galaxies and the icm in the virgo cluster will dominate the emission",
    ". nevertheless , high - resolution x - ray spectroscopy would be useful to constrain the velocity field ( and metallicity ) of the x - ray gas and to help establish if the hot gas near ngc  4388 is in hydrostatic equilibrium in the galaxy potential or instead represents fast - moving , shocked icm .",
    "detailed investigations of bow shocks in galaxy clusters have the potential to help us determine the space velocities of galaxy members with respect to the icm .    from a theoretical viewpoint",
    "there is a need to explore the effects of a fast - moving icm as it interacts with a gas - rich galaxy .",
    "few such models have been published ( e.g. , kritsuk 1984 ; tosa 1994 ) , and none considers the multi - phase nature of the ism and the effects that this interaction may have on star formation ( e.g. , through compression ; kenney & young 1989 ; cayatte et al .",
    "the icm ` wind ' will also affect the morphology of the nuclear ejecta from starburst galaxies and agn ( e.g. , wide - angle tailed radio sources in cluster environment ; loken et al .",
    "outflowing gas will stretch in the direction of the icm motion , thereby increasing the effective gaseous cross - section of these galaxies and perhaps contributing significantly to the population of c  iv absorption lines systems in quasars ( e.g. , norman et al . 1996 ) .",
