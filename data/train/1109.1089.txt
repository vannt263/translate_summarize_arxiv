    "this paper concerns the interplay between brake orbits and syzygies in the newtonian three body problem . a _ brake orbit _ is a solution , not necessarily periodic , for which the velocities of all three bodies are zero at some instant , the ` brake instant ' .",
    "brake orbits have zero angular momentum and negative energy .",
    "a _ syzygy _ occurs when the three bodies become collinear .",
    "we will count binary collisions as syzygies , but exclude triple collision .",
    "lagrange @xcite discovered a brake orbit which ends in triple collision .",
    "the three bodies form an equilateral triangle at each instant , the triangle shrinking homothetically to triple collision . extended over its maximum interval of existence , lagrange s solution explodes out of triple collision ,",
    "reaches maximum size at the brake instant , and then shrinks back to triple collision .",
    "lagrange s solution is the only negative energy , zero angular momentum solution without syzygies @xcite . in particular , brake orbits have negative energy , and zero angular momentum , and so all of them , _ except _ lagrange s , suffer syzygies .",
    "thus we have a map taking a brake initial condition to its first syzygy .",
    "we call this map the _ syzygy map_. upon fixing the energy and reducing by symmetries , the domain and range of the map are topologically punctured open discs , the punctures corresponding to the lagrange orbit",
    ". see figure  [ fig_hillspherical ] where the map takes the top  zero - velocity surface \" , or upper hill boundary , of the solid hill s region to the plane inside representing the collinear configurations .",
    "the exceptional lagrange orbit runs from the central point on the top surface to the origin in the plane ( which corresponds to triple collision ) , connecting the puncture in the domain to the puncture in the range .",
    "[ thm : cty ] the syzygy map is continuous . its image contains a neighborhood of the binary collision locus . for a large open set of mass parameters , including equal masses",
    ", the map extends continuously to the puncture , taking the equilateral triangle of lagrange to triple collision .",
    "* remark on the range .",
    "* numerical evidence suggests that the syzygy map is not onto ( see figure  [ fig_syzygyimage ] ) .",
    "the closure of its range lies strictly inside the collinear hill s region .",
    "a heuristic explanation for this is as follows .",
    "the boundary of the domain of the syzygy map is the collinear zero velocity curve , i.e. , the collinear hill boundary .",
    "orbits starting on this curve remain collinear for all time and so are in a permanent state of syzygy .",
    "nearby , non - collinear orbits oscillate around the collinear invariant manifold and take a certain time to reach syzygy , which need not approach zero as the initial point approaches the boundary of the domain .",
    "thus the nearby orbits have time to move away from the boundary before reaching syzygy .",
    "it may be that the syzygy map extends continuously to the boundary but we do not pursue this question here .",
    "collision - free syzygies come in three types , 1 , 2 , and 3 depending on which mass lies between the other two at syzygy . listing the syzygy types in temporal order yields the syzygy sequence of a solution .",
    "( the syzygy sequence of a periodic collision - free solution encodes its free homotopy type , or braid type . ) in ( @xcite , @xcite ) the notion of syzygy sequence was used as a topological sorting tool for the three - body problem .",
    "( see also @xcite and @xcite . )",
    "a `` stuttering orbit '' is a solution whose syzygy sequence has a stutter , meaning that the same symbol occurs twice in a row , as in `` 11 '' `` 22 '' or ` 33'. for topological and variational reasons , one of us had believed that stuttering sequences were rare .",
    "the theorem easily proves the contrary to be true .    within the negative energy , zero angular momentum phase space for the three body problem",
    "there is an open and unbounded set corresponding to stuttering orbits .",
    "if a collinear configuration @xmath0 is in the image of the syzygy map , and if @xmath1 is the velocity of the brake orbit segment at @xmath0 , then by running this orbit backwards , which is to say , considering the solution with initial condition @xmath2 , we obtain a brake orbit whose next syzygy is @xmath0 , with velocity @xmath3 .",
    "this brake orbit is a stuttering orbit as long as @xmath0 is not a collision point .",
    "perturbing initial conditions slightly can not destroy stutters , due to transversality of the orbit with the syzygy plane .",
    "* periodic brake orbits . * in 1893 a mathematician named meissel conjectured that if masses in the ratio 3 , 4 , 5 are place at the vertices of a 3 - 4 - 5 triangle and let go from rest then the corresponding brake orbit is periodic .",
    "burrau @xcite reported the conversation with meissel and performed a pen - and - paper numerical tour - de - force which suggested the conjecture may be false .",
    "this `` pythagorean three - body problem '' became a test case for numerical integration methods .",
    "szehebely @xcite carried the integration further and found the motion ends ( and begins ) in an elliptic - hyperbolic escape peters and szehebeley @xcite perturbed away from the pythagorean initial conditions and with the help of newton iteration found a periodic brake orbit .",
    "modern investigations into periodic brake orbits in general hamiltonian systems began with seifert s @xcite 1948 topological existence proof for the existence of such orbits for harmonic - oscillator type potentials .",
    "( otto raul ruiz coined the term `` brake orbits '' in @xcite . )",

    "assume the masses are @xmath5 .",
    "then there is an invariant isosceles subsystem of the three - body problem and we will prove :    [ theorem_isosbrake ] for @xmath6 in an open set of mass parameters , including @xmath7 , there is a periodic isosceles brake orbit which hits the syzygy plane @xmath4 orthogonally upon its 2nd hit ( see figure  [ fig_isoshill ] ) .",
