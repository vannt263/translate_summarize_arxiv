    "conductance quantization in a quantum point contact ( qpc ) , first observed in 1988@xcite , constitutes a classic textbook effect of mesoscopic physics . on top of the integer conductance plateaus @xmath0",
    "( where @xmath1 ) observed as a function of gate voltage @xmath2 , many experiments have found a temperature - dependent suppression of the conductance appearing in the first half of the conductance plateau .",
    "this shoulder - like feature is seen at elevated temperature @xmath3 ( or finite voltage @xmath4 ) near the first quantized plateau@xcite , accompanied by a shot noise reduction@xcite .",
    "it appears approximately around 0.7 @xmath5 , and has therefore been named the `` 0.7 anomaly''@xcite . despite the conceptual simplicity of a qpc and the fact that the 0.7 anomaly has been observed in a variety of material systems by different groups over more than a decade , still no generally accepted microscopic theory exists , apart from an overall consensus that one is dealing with some spin - related effect .    while phenomenological models@xcite , assuming the existence of a density - dependent spin gap , can provide rather good fits to experimental data , the presumed static spin polarization due to interactions within the _ local _  qpc region is not expected in the presence of unpolarized _ bulk _  reservoirs . along this line of thinking",
    ", it was recently conjectured that spin symmetry - broken mean - field or density functional theory calculations are unable to recover the correct @xmath3 dependence of the conductance@xcite .",
    "a number of microscopic theories assume the existence of a quasi - bound state in the qpc region , leading to a kondo - type scenario , as encountered in transport through interacting quantum dots@xcite .",
    "such a quasi - bound state was indeed found in spin density functional theory ( sdft ) calculations@xcite , and models based on this picture appear to reproduce several essential observations related to the 0.7 anomaly .",
    "however , different sdft works also reached different conclusions@xcite .",
    "further proposals involve phonon effects@xcite .",
    "several publications have suggested that electron - electron ( e - e ) interactions alone may already result in a reduced conductance in a qpc at elevated temperatures , without the need for additional assumptions of spin polarization or a localized state@xcite .",

    "the full ( black ) lines represent incoming electrons , while the dashed ( red ) lines are the outgoing electrons .",
    "the thick ( blue ) lines define the edge of the qpc . only scattering between different spins",
    "is present to leading order in @xmath6 due to the pauli principle.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    [ sec : main ]    motivated by this body of experimental and theoretical work , we reconsider the role of e - e interactions for electronic transport properties in qpcs , starting from the assumption that in the low - temperature limit , a qpc is well described by a single - particle saddle - point potential .",
    "we then include e - e scattering , and , in particular , all _ momentum - nonconserving _ processes , where the number of left- and right - moving electrons does not have to be conserved in the scattering process , see figure [ fig : back ] ) .",
    "these processes are not allowed in infinitely long translationally invariant ( single - mode ) quantum wires . however , the lack of translational invariance for a qpc connected to reservoirs permits such processes here .",
    "in other words , momentum is not a good quantum number for a qpc , and therefore interactions processes can violate momentum conservation .",
    "momentum - nonconserving processes are most relevant in the low - density regime , where the fermi wavelength is comparable to the qpc s length , which is set by the curvature of the saddle - point potential and/or the distance to the gate electrodes@xcite .",
    "indeed , our quantitative analysis of the matrix elements for these processes ( see below ) shows that the effect of momentum - nonconserving scattering can be substantial , and implies that the conductance is significantly reduced at elevated temperatures , where the phase space for inelastic scattering is increased .",
    "we find that the breaking of translational invariance , and hence the backscattering rate , is most dramatic near the onset of the plateau , and then gradually decreases for larger electron density in the qpc .",
    "we start from the assumption that the low - temperature limit of a qpc at the first quantized plateau is well described by a fermi - liquid picture with propagating single - particle states@xcite . throughout the paper , we consider only a single transverse channel being transmitted . without interactions and at low temperatures , @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is the _ local _ fermi energy , see ( [ localef ] ) below ) , the conductance is given by the standard landauer - b@xmath9ttiker@xcite formula , @xmath10 , where @xmath4 is the voltage difference across the contact and @xmath1 . in this paper",
    ", we are interested in the properties at the plateau , i.e. when the zero - temperature transmission probability is close to one , @xmath11 . at zero temperature",
    ", electrons do not experience inelastic scattering from either phonons or other electrons .",
    "however , as temperature increases , phase space also increases for such scattering events .",
    "the effect of phonon scattering has previously been studied by seelig and matveev@xcite . here",
    ", we address the question of inelastic e - e scattering , which can cause electron backscattering .",
    "for example , two incoming electrons from the high - bias side can interact in the contact and scatter , so that one electron is backscattered while the other is transmitted .",
    "these processes are later denoted as @xmath12 and shown in figure [ fig : back ] .",
    "also shown is a backscattering process for two electrons@xcite , which we denote as @xmath13 .",
    "both processes will lead to a current reduction .",
    "the matrix elements for the momentum - nonconserving processes can , to leading order in the single - particle reflection @xmath14 , be calculated using the fully transmitting wavefunctions . to good approximation ,",
    "these can be described as wkb states in an effective 1d potential @xmath15 , which is a combination of the potential barrier and the confinement barrier@xcite , see section [ sec : model ] and figure [ fig : wkb ] .",

    "illustration of the effective 1d potential of the qpc and the transmitting wavefunction @xmath21 .",
    "the wavefunction shows an enhanced weight in the contact region , which loosely speaking reflects the fact that electrons spend more time there .",
    "this so - called semiclassical  slowing down \" is the main reason for the finite values of the backscattering processes shown in figure [ fig : back ] , cf .",
    "also  @xcite , and will be discussed in section [ sec2:b].,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    for a contact with @xmath22 , we may estimate the leading - order e - e interaction correction to the current by using fermi s golden rule . to that end",
    ", we compute the rates for the two scattering events shown in figure [ fig : back ] and add them up , with a weight factor keeping track of the respective contribution to the current .",
    "this gives the e - e interaction correction to the current in the form ( @xmath23 ) @xmath24 where we use the short - hand notation @xmath25 , with @xmath26 being the spin index , and sums run over the quantum numbers of the scattering states , @xmath27 in  ( [ fgr ] ) , the occupation factors @xmath28 are given by fermi - dirac distribution functions defined by the respective reservoirs , @xmath29 where one should use @xmath30 for right - movers @xmath31 and @xmath32 for left - movers ( @xmath33 ) , and we have allowed for different temperatures in the two leads .",
    "furthermore , in ( [ fgr ] ) , the factor @xmath34 accounts for the change of the relative number of right- and left - moving particles from initial to final states .",
    "equation ( [ fgr ] ) is also found from rigorous perturbation theory in the keldysh formalism , see section [ sec : perturbation ] , where the matrix elements @xmath35 are specified in ( [ vw ] ) . as expected , they contain both a direct and an exchange term , which is important for the behavior in a large spin - splitting magnetic field .",
    "the magnitude of the relevant coupling strengths is carefully estimated in section [ sec2:b ] .    based on ( [ fgr ] ) , for @xmath36 , we obtain the linear conductance at low temperatures in the form @xmath37 where a realistic estimate for a typical gaas qpc indicates that @xmath38 at the beginning of the plateau .",
    "the result ( [ cond ] ) has also been reported in @xcite , where the qpc was modeled using a kinetic equation .",
    "their prefactor @xmath39 is proportional to an unknown `` relaxation time in the leads '' , a quantity that does not appear in our theory .",
    "instead @xmath39 is directly connected to the inelastic e - e interaction processes .",
    "we find that @xmath39 rapidly decreases when moving along the plateau , see also figure [ fig : interaction - strengths ] .",
    "the dimensionless coefficient @xmath39 includes the effects of both the @xmath12 and the @xmath13 backscattering processes .",
    "it is also interesting to consider the interaction correction at spin - split plateaus , i.e. for large magnetic fields . here",
    "the energy dependence of the matrix element @xmath35 becomes important for equal - spin scattering , since _ exactly at the fermi energy _",
    "the direct and exchange terms cancel for equal spins only ( see section [ sec : largebfield ] ) . hence , e - e scattering corrections in the spin - polarized case are much smaller .",
    "in fact , the leading contribution turns out to be of order @xmath40 , and the prefactor is smaller than @xmath39 .",
    "physically , this can be understood in terms of the pauli principle .",
    "this qualitatively agrees with the experimental observation that almost no conductance suppression at the @xmath41 plateau occurs .",
    "below we also provide results for the interaction corrections to other experimentally relevant quantities , such as shot noise , the thermopower , and the nonlinear conductance .",
    "the effect of e - e backscattering is thus most important at the beginning of the @xmath42 plateau . on the other hand , for elevated temperatures",
    ", it leads to a breakdown of perturbation theory .",
    "therefore , a crossover to a different type of behavior must appear . from equation  ( [ cond ] ) , the temperature scale for this crossover is expected to be @xmath43 contrary to the usual situation encountered in mesoscopic physics , the nontrivial question to be answered thus concerns the high - temperature limit ( but still @xmath7 ) . to investigate this question ,",
    "we have studied a local interaction model by means of a nonequilibrium formalism , employing a self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) for the self - energy . in this case",
    ", our numerical results suggest that the linear conductance approaches a saturation value @xmath44 of order @xmath45 at high temperatures .",
    "the saturation is physically due to the fact that e - e scattering processes within the qpc region fully equilibrate outgoing electrons , which also suggests that @xmath46 is non - universal and thus depends on the detailed form of the various e - e couplings .",
    "we mention in passing that a high-@xmath3 saturation of the conductance has also been reported for long 1d wires@xcite ,      the structure of this article is as follows . in section [ sec : model ] , we define the model of the qpc , and provide estimates for the parameters involved . in section [ sec : perturbation ] , this model is treated by lowest - order perturbation theory , and the interaction corrections to linear and nonlinear conductance , shot noise , and thermopower are computed . a simplified version of the qpc model with a local e - e interaction potential is then considered within a nonequilibrium formalism in section [ sec : num ] , leading to a self - consistent numerical approach .",
    "this allows us to go beyond lowest - order perturbation theory , albeit in an approximate fashion .",
    "we briefly conclude in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "details of the calculations can be found in two appendices . in intermediate steps",
    ", we sometimes set @xmath47 .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) with a single - particle potential @xmath48 forming the qpc , where @xmath49 .",
    "close to the middle of the constriction , @xmath50 , the potential is assumed to be described by a saddle - point potential@xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) is along ( perpendicular to ) the transport direction of the qpc .",
    "the qpc is thus characterized by the frequencies @xmath54 and @xmath55 , or , equivalently , by the length scales @xmath56 and @xmath57 . transforming the 2d schrdinger equation into 1d ,",
    "the @xmath53-direction simply gives transversal 1d subbands ( modes ) labeled by @xmath58 .",
    "therefore the effective 1d schrdinger equation for mode @xmath59 has a potential given by @xmath60 and the well - known transmission probability through the @xmath61 mode is@xcite @xmath62}. \\label{eq : transmission}\\ ] ] this transmission coefficient leads to the low - temperature conductance quantization in a qpc .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the situation when the fermi energy is tuned such that only the lowest transversal state @xmath63 propagates through the constriction , and does so with transmission close to unity , @xmath64 .",
    "therefore only the first ( spin - degenerate ) mode @xmath63 is included in the 1d hamiltonian @xmath65 .",
    "the noninteracting part is @xmath66 and the coulomb interaction gives @xmath67 where @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for the @xmath63 mode .",
    "the effective ( unscreened ) 1d interaction @xmath70 can be found by integration over the transverse eigenstates in the lowest mode , @xmath71 .",
    "this gives @xmath72 where @xmath73 denotes the relative dielectric constant , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 is the ( zeroth - order ) modified bessel function of the second kind .",
    "this model of the interaction @xmath70 depends only on the difference @xmath76 , and therefore appears not to break translational invariance",
    ". however , when including the scattering states , the effective interaction _ will _",
    "break translational invariance , see the discussion in section [ sec2:b ] below .    for energies above the barrier top",
    ", the scattering states can be approximated by the wkb eigenstates ( [ wkbmain ] ) , and we can thus expand the 1d fermion operators as @xmath77 where the energy integral is from the top of the single - particle potential to infinity , and @xmath78 is a scattering - state annihilation operator with anticommutation relations @xmath79 .",
    "the noninteracting hamiltonian then effectively becomes @xmath80 where we again use the short - hand notation @xmath81 , see ( [ sumdef ] ) .",
    "similarly , the interacting part reads @xmath82 with the matrix elements @xmath83 these matrix elements are discussed in section [ sec2:b ] . for later purposes , it is also useful to introduce the corresponding matrix elements without the spin factors and taking the energies at the fermi surface , @xmath84 throughout the paper , we distinguish between the fermi energy @xmath85 in the equilibrium leads and the local fermi energy @xmath86 in the qpc , @xmath87 the single - particle thermal smearing of the conductance plateau occurs on the energy scale @xmath86 , and therefore we are here only interested in effects at lower energies , i.e. @xmath7 .      in order to determine the saddle - point potential ( [ ux ] ) , one should in principle solve for the potential self - consistently , including the screening by surrounding gate electrodes and mean - field interaction effects .",
    "for the electrons in the constriction , the latter amount to the hartree - fock approximation , @xmath88 where the self - consistent hartree - fock potential is @xmath89 with @xmath90 .",
    "the self - consistent mean - field theory was discussed in @xcite , showing that the mean - field result for the @xmath3-dependence of the conductance is markedly different from both the experimental observations and the finite-@xmath3 corrections due to inelastic e - e processes studied in this paper .    to illustrate this point ,",
    "let us consider the hartree approximation .",
    "then the change of the local density @xmath91 with increasing temperature follows by using a sommerfeld expansion .",

    "first , we note that the density decreases with increasing temperature , because the 1d density of states decreases with increasing energy .",

    ", the potential correction can be written as @xmath96 thereby the hartree correction can be captured by a temperature - dependent renormalization of the barrier height @xmath97 and of the curvature @xmath98 of the saddle potential in the transport direction .",

    "the quoted expressions",
    "are useful for @xmath106 , where @xmath107 . inspection of ( [ eq : transmission ] ) then shows that the net effect of the hartree correction is an _ enhancement _  of the transmission towards @xmath36 .",
    "as a consequence , a conductance plateau present already at zero temperature is then essentially not affected by the hartree contribution as long as @xmath7 .",
    "a quantitative discussion of the hartree corrections to the saddle - point potential can be found in section [ sec2:b ] below .    concerning the fock part ,",
    "a simple qualitative approximation is obtained if the pair potential is assumed to be a contact interaction , @xmath108 , see also @xcite .",
    "( this expression requires that the long - ranged tail of the e - e interaction potential is screened by nearby electrodes . ) in that case , also the fock contribution is local , and acts in precisely the same ( but opposite ) way as the hartree potential , thereby partially cancelling the effects of the latter . in particular , it leads to the same temperature dependence of the corrections .",
    "we therefore conclude that the hartree - fock contribution leads to a very weak temperature dependence of the conductance , which even goes in opposite direction as compared to the effects of the inelastic e - e contributions .",
    "this temperature dependence of the mean - field result for the qpc conductance has been described in detail before@xcite .    in the following",
    ", the weak @xmath3-dependence of the conductance under a single - particle picture will be neglected , and we focus on the effects of inelastic e - e scattering . hence the interaction ( [ hi ] ) is replaced by @xmath109 when performing diagrammatic expansions , the first - order contribution in @xmath110 vanishes per definition , and the series starts with the second order in @xmath110 , see sections [ sec : perturbation ] and [ sec : num ] . from now on ,",
    "the hartree - fock part is assumed to be contained in the single - particle potential @xmath15 .      in order for our subsequent calculations to be meaningful , it is essential to first show that the relevant e - e backscattering strengths can be sufficiently large in experimentally relevant qpc geometries . in the following ,",
    "we therefore provide such estimates and demonstrate that in the beginning of the first conductance quantization plateau , these couplings are indeed significant .",
    "let us then consider an almost perfectly transmitting qpc and calculate the matrix elements that give rise to momentum - nonconserving scattering . for a simple estimate of the relevant e - e backscattering strengths , we now employ the wkb wavefunctions , see section [ sec : main ] . for larger reflection probability",
    "the wkb approximation is not adequate and a more sophisticated approach must be used .    because of the lower electron density in the qpc region , also denoted as _ semiclassical slowing down_@xcite , interactions are strongest near the constriction , see figure [ fig : wkb ] .",

    "we believe that our theory offers a complementary approach to the 0.7 anomaly , which is not based on the assumption of a ( quasi-)bound state in the qpc . in real samples , however , extrinsic effects ( e.g. disorder ) may be responsible for the presence of a bound state , and both mechanisms may then be relevant in parallel .    to conclude , we hope that our work stimulates additional theoretical and experimental work on interaction effects in quantum point contacts .",

    "while we have repeatedly mentioned the experimental observations related to the 0.7 anomaly as the main motivation for our work , it is also clear that a realistic and quantitative description of experiments needs to consider a more refined modelling .",
    "this is especially important for the proper description of magnetic field effects away from the perturbative high magnetic field limit described in section [ sec : largebfield ] .",
    "moreover , on the theoretical side , it would be highly desirable to go beyond our perturbative calculation in a more realistic model .",
    "for instance , the gate - voltage dependence of the conductance at elevated temperatures  giving rise to the shoulder - like feature associated with the 0.7 anomaly  is not accessible to our theory at the moment , neither in the perturbative regime nor for the point - like interaction model in section [ sec : num ] , where the gate - voltage dependence is difficult to incorporate . in any case",
