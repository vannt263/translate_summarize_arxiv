    "the study of atoms under confinement is a subject of long standing interest , for a selection of reviews see @xcite-@xcite . for many unconfined atoms ,",
    "their polarizabilities are known to a high degree of accuracy , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an interesting question arises as to the effect of confinement on the polarizability of an atom .",
    "the majority of studies investigating the polarizabilities of atoms under confinement have been carried out for hydrogen , see @xcite-@xcite for some early work and @xcite-@xcite for more recent calculations . for helium ,",
    "an early calculation @xcite has been followed by density functional @xcite , configuration interaction @xcite , coupled cluster @xcite and variational @xcite calculations with confining potentials studied including cylindrical @xcite and spheroidal @xcite . for heavier systems , one - electron model potentials have been used to study the static dipole polarizability of alkali metals under hard wall confinement @xcite and debye screening @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the static dipole polarizability and hyperpolarizability of beryllium was studied under harmonic , rectangular and gaussian confining potentials using a basis of explicitly correlated gaussians @xcite . for the polarizabilities of noble gas atoms under hard wall confinement , an early calculation studied the confined argon atom in a thomas - fermi model @xcite .",
    "hartree - fock calculations @xcite-@xcite and a time - dependent density - functional theory @xcite calculation have since been performed along the noble gas sequence .",
    "the polarizabilities of confined noble gases are of interest in interpreting the density dependence of atomic polarizabilities @xcite and studies of noble gas endofullerenes @xcite-@xcite .    here ,",
    "non - relativistic random phase approximation with exchange ( rpae ) calculations of the static dipole polarizability are performed for noble gas atoms under hard - wall confinement .",
    "the rpae method @xcite-@xcite has been shown to give dipole polarizabilities accurate to within a few percent for the noble gases when compared to more sophisticated calculations @xcite , with relativistic effects having a small effect on polarizabilities for the noble gases @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows : section ii details the rpae approximation to the calculation of the static dipole polarizability and its numerical implemention using b - splines . in section iii",
    "a , results are presented for the static dipole polarizabilities of hydrogen and noble gas atoms confined by an impenetrable sphere .",
    "section iii b investigates the case of a spherical shell potential .",
    "finally , section iv concludes with a summary . unless otherwise stated , atomic units are used throughout .",
    "for a hydrogen atom in the ground state , the static dipole polarizability can be calculated via the relation , @xmath0    for noble gas atoms , electron correlation beyond the hartree - fock approximation plays an important role and must be accounted for .",
    "the dipole polarizability for noble gas atoms will be calculated via the rpae approximation @xcite-@xcite . in the following equations for the rpae vertex matrix element ,",
    "the summation is over hole states , or states below the fermi level ( @xmath1 ) , and excited electron states above the fermi level ( @xmath2 ) .    for ( @xmath3 ) and",

    "the hartree - fock equations will be solved for noble gas atoms confined by a potential .",
    "two forms of the confining potential will be compared here .",

    "@xmath27 where @xmath28 is the inner radius and @xmath29 is the outer radius of the spherical shell potential .",
    "as the radius of the confining potential may lie within the radius of the unconfined atom , it is necessary to incorporate potentials ( [ sphpot1 ] ) and ( [ sphpot2 ] ) into the numerical solution of the hartree - fock equations @xcite,@xcite .",
    "for all noble gas atoms , the hartree - fock equations were solved using a cut off radius of 30 a.u . and 6000 integration points .",
    "note that for heavier atoms , convergence of the hartree - fock equations for small radii of the confining potential is more problematic . results will be presented in this work down to the minimum radius of the confining potential for which convergence was obtained .    as polarizabilities of atoms can involve substantial contributions from continuum states , an efficient means of spanning the single particle energy continuum is needed . here",
    ", b - spline basis sets will be used @xcite .",
    "b - splines are piecewise polynomials defined on a particular knot sequence . for confinement by an impenetrable spherical potential ,",

    "@xmath44 a generalised eigenvalue problem is obtained for angular momentum @xmath45 that can be solved to obtain a complete set of states suitable for the calculation of the atomic polarizabilities via equations ( [ polhy])-([rpaeq3 ] ) .",
