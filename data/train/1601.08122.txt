    "since the seminal work by  @xcite , quantum walks have been the subject of research for the past two decades .",
    "they were originally proposed as a quantum generalization of classical random walks  @xcite .",
    "asymptotic properties such as mixing time , mixing rate and hitting time of quantum walks on a line and on general graphs have been studied extensively  @xcite .",
    "applications of quantum walks for quantum information processing have also been investigated .",
    "especially , quantum walks can solve the element distinctness problem  @xcite and perform the quantum search algorithms  @xcite . in some applications",
    ", quantum walks based algorithms can even gain exponential speedup over all possible classical algorithms  @xcite .",
    "the discovery of their capability for universal quantum computations  @xcite indicates that understanding quantum walks is necessary for better understanding quantum computing itself . for a more comprehensive review ,",
    "we refer the readers to  @xcite and the references within .    one dimensional three state quantum walks , first considered by inui et al .",
    "@xcite , are variations of two state quantum walks on a line . in the three state walk , the walker is governed by a coin with three degrees of freedom . in each step",
    ", the walker is not only capable of moving left or right , but also able to stay at the same position .",
    "three state quantum walks have interesting differences from two state quantum walks .",
    "most notably , if the walker of a three state quantum walk is initialized at one site , it is trapped with large probability near the origin after walking enough steps  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is previously found in quantum walks on square lattices  @xcite and is called localization . in fact , this model is the simplest model that exhibits localization , a quantum effect entirely absent from the corresponding classical random walk .",
    "three state random walks are essentially regarded as the same process as two state random walks by scaling the time .",
    "a thorough understanding of the localization effect on this model becomes particularly relevant given the fact that this phenomenon is commonplace in higher - dimensional systems  @xcite .",
    "recent researches showed that the localization effect happens with a broad family of coin operators in three state quantum walks  @xcite .",
    "the presence of absorbing boundaries apparently complicates the analysis of three state quantum walks considerably . in this paper , we focus on the question of determining the absorbing probabilities in grover walks with one and two boundaries .",
    "first , we consider the case where we have a single absorbing boundary .",
    "the walk process is terminated if the walker reaches that boundary .",
    "we offer methods to calculate the absorbing probability for an arbitrary boundary .",
    "when the boundary is fixed at @xmath0 , it is known that in the classical case the walker is absorbed with probability 1  @xcite , while in hadamard walks the walker has an absorption probability of @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "intuitively , as some probability amplitudes are trapped near origin due to the localization effect in grover walks , the absorbing probability of grover walks is smaller than that of hadamard walks .",
    "however , the grover walker is absorbed with probability @xmath2 which is larger than @xmath1 .",
    "what s more , when the boundary is moved from @xmath0 to @xmath3 , the absorbing probabilities suffer an extreme fast decrease . to explain these strange behaviors",
    ", we numerically study the oscillating localization effect in grover walks with one boundary .",
    "we find that the localization is occurred owing to the quantum state oscillating between @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "if the boundary is at @xmath0 , the localization effect disappears and the state is absorbed , resulting in a large absorbing probability .",
    "if the boundary is at @xmath3 , the localization effect revives and the absorbing probability plummets .",
    "then , we review the case where there are two boundaries - one is at site @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) to the walker s left , and the other is at site @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) to the walker s right .",
    "the walk is terminated if the walker is trapped in either absorbing boundary .",
    "methods are designed to calculate the left and right absorbing probabilities to arbitrary accuracy for arbitrary left and right boundaries . in hadamard",
    "walks , the left absorbing probability approaches @xmath9  @xcite when the left boundary is at @xmath0 and the right boundary approaches infinity .",
    "it is concluded that adding a second boundary on the right actually increases the probability of reaching the left  @xcite . in grover",
    "walks with two boundaries , we get the same left absorbing probability @xmath9 under the same setting .",
    "the conclusion is still correct in grover walks as @xmath10 .",
    "when the left boundary is at @xmath0 , the oscillating localization effect disappears . as position @xmath0",
    "is occupied , the part of quantum state , which would have otherwise localized , now is absorbed . when the left boundary is to the left of @xmath0 , the sum of the left and right absorbing probabilities is generally less than @xmath11 due to oscillating localization . when studying the case where the left boundary is at @xmath3",
    ", we show that the localization probabilities are exponentially decaying in grover walks with two boundaries .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : definition ] gives formal definitions of grover walks with one and two absorbing boundaries , and the absorbing probabilities which we study .",
    "section [ sec : one - boundary ] and section [ sec : two - boundaries ] present the methods and results on grover walks with one and two boundaries .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the three state quantum walk ( 3qw ) considered here is a kind of generalized two state quantum walk on a line .",
    "the hilbert space of the system is given by the tensor product @xmath12 of the position space @xmath13 and the coin space @xmath14 . in each step , the walker has three choices - it can move to the left , move to the right or just stay at the current position . to each of these options ,",

    "the grover operator is defined as @xmath23 the state of the walker after evolving @xmath24 steps is given by the successive applications of the evolution operator @xmath25 on the initial state .",
    "let @xmath26 be the system state after walking @xmath24 steps , then @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the initial state , @xmath29 is the probability amplitude of the walker being at position @xmath30 with coin state @xmath31 after walking @xmath24 steps . @xmath32 and @xmath33 are defined similarly .",
