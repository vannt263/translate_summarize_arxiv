    "neutron star surface emission has long been sought as a measure of the star s thermal history and , hence , a probe of the equation of state of matter at supra - nuclear densities .",
    "since temperatures remain near @xmath4k for @xmath5y , this emission is best probed in the soft x - ray band .",
    "recent detections of a number of neutron stars with rosat ( becker 1995 ) show good promise of enabling a study of neutron star cooling . while spectra are",
    "still generally fit with blackbodies at present , it has been shown ( romani 1987 ) that radiation transfer through the surface layers can have very significant effects on the emergent spectrum , depending on the composition .",
    "conditions on the neutron star surface are very uncertain .",
    "while the supernova explosion has a mass cut in the iron layer , envelope fallback , accretion during neutron star evolution , and possibly spallation by energetic magnetospheric particles can introduce light elements ( _ eg . _",
    "h and he ) to the neutron star surface .",
    "because gravitational sedimentation is rapid , the lightest element present should dominate the photosphere and the emergent spectrum .",
    "this uncertainty makes it important to compute emergent spectra for both light element and heavy element atmospheres . as shown by romani ( 1987 )",
    "the general trend is for light elements , with kramer s law opacities at high e , to have emergent spectra with large excesses in the wien tail over the equivalent blackbody .",
    "heavy element atmospheres give spectra much closer to blackbodies , but show strong line and edge features .",
    "recent updates of low b model atmosphere computations ( rajagopal & romani 1996 ( rr96 ) ; zavlin , pavlov & shibanov 1997 ( zps96 ) ) provide a good set of models for comparison with low field neutron stars . as an example , rr96 found that h spectra fit rosat pspc observations of the low - b millisecond pulsar j04374715 much better than did heavy element atmosphere spectra .",
    "most observed neutron stars , however , have surface fields at least as strong as the surface dipole , @xmath6 g or higher . detailed treatment of the atomic cross sections and the equation of state has allowed pavlov and colleagues ( pavlov et al .",
    "1995 ; shibanov et al .",
    "1992 ) to study emergent spectra from magnetized h atmosphere neutron stars . unlike the recycled pulsars , though , the young , high field neutron stars have presumably experienced little accretion .",
    "it is therefore important to estimate the spectral effects of heavy element atmospheres to compare with the magnetic h results .",
    "a first attempt was pursued by miller ( 1992 ) who obtained approximate energy levels and cross sections for heavy atoms in strong fields ( miller & neuhauser 1991 ) and computed emergent spectra .",
    "these opacities were very approximate , employing only bound - free cross sections and averaging the polarization modes .",
    "pavlov et al . ( 1995 ) argue that these approximations are too severe for the high field models .",
    "in this paper we present substantially improved magnetic fe atmospheres , incorporating more detailed opacity and equation of state estimates , normal mode radiative transfer and more realistic magnetic geometries .",
    "these approximate atmospheres will provide a useful baseline for comparison with the magnetic h results .",
    "since fully detailed fe atmospheres will be very difficult to construct , we focus on the broad spectral differences between models and note the areas where more detailed models can improve the spectral estimates .",
    "when the electron cyclotron radius @xmath7 cm becomes smaller than the approximate zero - field outermost electron orbital sizes of an ion @xmath8 , ( @xmath9 cm , @xmath10 the net charge of the ion ) , the ion s atomic structure perpendicular to the field is altered significantly . for hydrogenic atoms of nuclear charge @xmath11 in the ground state , this occurs at a magnetic field @xmath12 , where @xmath13 g. well below this field the electron wave functions are approximately spherical , whereas far above it they are best represented as cylinders given by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 are cylindrical co - ordinates about the magnetic field direction @xmath16 , @xmath17 are the cylindrical landau states , and @xmath18 is the wave function in the direction of the field .",
    "this assumption of separability in cylindrical co - ordinates is sometimes called the ` adiabatic approximation ' . here",

    "the @xmath24 wave functions are annular , with radius @xmath25 and width @xmath26 ( e.g meszaros 1992 ) .    to compute energies and electron configurations for iron in strong magnetic fields",
    ", we use a multiconfigurational hartree - fock code developed by neuhauser , langanke , & koonin ( 1986 ; see also miller & neuhauser 1991 ) .",
    "this code computes the wave functions and state energies in the ` adiabatic approximation ' , with landau level @xmath27 only , since the first landau energy ( cyclotron energy , @xmath28kev for a magnetic field of @xmath29 g ) greatly exceeds both @xmath30 and all the photon energies @xmath31 we consider .",
    "for the innermost electron of iron at the magnetic fields we consider , @xmath32 g and @xmath33 g , this code gives binding energies that can be low by as much as 15% because the coulomb field of the nucleus is too strong for the separability assumption . however , for electrons with binding energies less than @xmath343 kev , whose transitions are most important for the observed spectrum , the code gives individual orbital energies accurate to better than 1% . for each ionization state",
    ", we have computed the energies and electron configurations of the ground state , and the first several ( @xmath35 ) excited states which generally extend to @xmath36 for the typical local atmosphere conditions . as electrons are added to the bare nucleus ,",
    "in the ground state they occupy the `` tightly - bound '' @xmath37 states , filling @xmath38 in order .",
    "these states have no @xmath39 node , and hence are localized nearer the nucleus than the `` loosely - bound '' @xmath40 states .",
    "ground states with many electrons also fill the @xmath41 orbitals , with only one electron per orbital ( a spin flip requires @xmath42 ) .",
    "the excited states we have are all formed by promoting the outermost electrons to higher @xmath20 , which costs little energy because of the weak @xmath20 dependence of @xmath43 ( above ) .",
    "we use these configurations to calculate the bound - free absorption cross section in each of the @xmath44 polarization modes ( described in  [ modes ] ) as a function of frequency for each individual electron , for at least the lowest five energy states of each ion .",
    "we also calculate the energies of the most important configurations accessible from the ground state via dipole allowed transitions , and some characteristic oscillator strengths for these , for transition energies up to 10 kev .",
    "these configurations are made by promoting any one of the outermost ( large-@xmath20 ) electrons to @xmath40 .",
    "let the @xmath45-ionized atom ( @xmath46 ) have excited states @xmath47 with energy levels @xmath48 .",
    "the ionization energies are @xmath49 , while the excitation energies are @xmath50 .",
    "then ionization equilibrium in a strong magnetic field gives the ion densities @xmath51 as @xmath52 ( khersonskii 1987 ) , where the sums are over the excitation states of the individual ions . here",
    "@xmath53 and @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the electron cyclotron frequency , @xmath56 is the cyclotron frequency of the @xmath45-ionized atom , @xmath57 is the mass of the electron , and @xmath58 is the mass of an iron nucleus .",
    "the sums are the partition functions for each ion , and the relative abundance of each excitation state is given simply by its boltzmann factor divided by that sum . at high densities in our atmospheres ,",
    "the electron continuum energy can be significantly depressed ; we approximate this depression by decreasing the ionization energies by @xmath59 ev , with @xmath60 the atmosphere density in @xmath61 ( cox & giuli 1968 ) . since we do not have an exhaustive list of @xmath62 to compute the partition function sums in ( [ kherson ] ) , we take a constant level spacing from the highest available excited states to complete the partition sum as a geometric series .",
    "this method does not include the loosely - bound states @xmath63 , of which we estimate there are @xmath35 for each @xmath20 , spread between @xmath64 the tight binding energy and the suppressed continuum . at the highest temperatures present in our atmospheres",
    ", the boltzmann suppression for these states only partly compensates for their large number , and they may contribute significantly to the partition function . under these conditions , more detailed treatments of ionization equilibrium will require exhaustive line lists , and a means of calculating pressure effects on partition sums and ionization tailored to the magnetic plasma .",
    "our equation of state under these extreme conditions is of necessity approximate , despite some justified simplifying assumptions .",
    "although the gas deep in our atmospheres would be degenerate at low fields , with high @xmath3 the degeneracy is strongly suppressed . in particular , the gas is non - degenerate if @xmath65 ( hernquist 1984 ) . for our atmospheres , @xmath66 and @xmath67",
    ", so the gas is far from degeneracy throughout ( fig .",
    "2 ) . also @xmath68 ; in the adiabatic limit , this ensures that only one landau level is occupied , although more exact treatments require the consideration of higher @xmath23 ( potehkin , pavlov and ventura 1997 ) .",
    "the plasma parameter @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the ion number density , is far below the solidification value ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "while our atmospheres do extend well past @xmath72 at high @xmath73 , we ignore the increasing non - ideality under these conditions ( @xmath74 fehr and kraft 1995 ) . accordingly , we solve for the ionization equilibrium conditions iteratively , using ( [ kherson ] ) , to find the number density of all species ( and hence @xmath75 ) required by the ideal gas law to produce the pressure @xmath76 needed for hydrostatic equilibrium (  [ converging ] ) .",
    "the mean ionization level @xmath77 is shown for selected @xmath78 in fig .",
    "we have tested the sensitivity of our final results to the omission of non - ideality corrections to the equation of state in two ways .",
    "first , we have adopted 20% of the debye - hckel correction as approximately appropriate for the densities near the base of our atmospheres ( rogers 1981 ) , to estimate the structure perturbation in our @xmath4k atmosphere model .",
    "holding the temperature run fixed , we find that although there are @xmath79% variations in density at the largest depths considered , at the surface the differences in the emergent spectrum are below @xmath80% near the peak , and the total flux difference is @xmath81% . we have also made the extreme assumption that the plasma becomes an incompressible liquid at @xmath82 and tested the effect on the emergent spectrum : @xmath83 changes were seen in the emergent flux near the weakly bound lines , but significant continuum variation was found only for @xmath84 .",
    "we therefore ignore plasma corrections in the following computations .",
    "in a magnetized plasma , radiation may propagate only in two specific polarization modes , called the normal modes .",
    "their properties are obtained in general by finding the polarizability tensor of the plasma , and using it to solve maxwell s equations for the case of a plane wave . for a collisionless magnetized plasma ,",
    "the resulting mode polarization components are easily given ( ginzburg 1970 ) in the co - ordinate system @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is in the propagation direction @xmath87 , and the magnetic field direction @xmath88 is in the @xmath89-@xmath86 plane , at angle @xmath90 from the @xmath86 axis .",
    "the relative strengths of the components for modes @xmath91 are @xmath92 where @xmath93 , and @xmath94 with @xmath95 the plasma frequency .",
    "we normalize these components , and rotate them to the basis @xmath96 with @xmath21 in the @xmath88 direction , and @xmath87 in the @xmath97-@xmath21 plane , retaining the definition of @xmath90 , not to be confused with the angle @xmath98 between @xmath87 and the atmosphere s outward normal .",
    "finally we construct @xmath99 and @xmath100 , the polarization components in the rotating co - ordinate basis in which the opacities are most easily calculated .",
    "the indices of refraction are @xmath101 for the large @xmath102 we consider , the @xmath103 mode has an imaginary index of refraction ( @xmath104 , @xmath105 real ) below the plasma frequency , when @xmath106 . in this case",
    "we add the extra `` skin - depth '' opacity @xmath107 to the total mode opacity of  [ totradop ] . in practice all but a negligible fraction of the emergent flux from our atmospheres is above the plasma frequency at the depth of spectrum formation .",
    "in fact , absorptive terms in the polarizability tensor corresponding to the various opacities affect the mode decomposition . as a test",
    ", we treat electron - ion collisions as in ginzburg ( 1970 ) , approximating non - magnetic free - free absorption : the effect is negligible except well below the plasma frequency .",
    "nonetheless we expect that proper inclusion of the atomic opacities will change the mode polarizations somewhat , especially in the line regions . to date",
    ", the only treatment of this effect is for hydrogen ( bulik & pavlov 1996 ) .      meszaros ( 1992 ) gives the normal mode electron scattering and free - free opacities as @xmath108\\ ] ] for thomson scattering , @xmath109 is just the non - magnetic cross - section , where @xmath110 is the fine structure constant , and @xmath111 . for free - free absorption ( brehmsstrahlung ) , @xmath112 is also the field - free cross - section , and the gaunt factors are given by @xmath113 \\frac{c_1(a_+ ) + c_1(a_-)}{(p^2 + 2m\\hbar\\omega)^{1/2 } } \\\\",

    "taking the bound - free @xmath44 basis cross sections from the hartree - fock wave function sums , we add the contributions from all electrons in each ion .",
    "the result for any excitation state of an ion is a bound - free edge and a falloff with complex structure . in the case of hydrogen",
    ", these features can be affected by the thermal motion of the ion transverse to the field ( kopidakis , ventura & herold , 1996 ) ; and , if adiabaticity is not assumed , by resonances with states with non - zero landau level ( potekhin , pavlov & ventura , 1997 ) .",
    "we expect the former effect to be much diminished for iron , while the latter could be as significant as other inaccuracies inherent in the ` adiabatic approximation ' ( see  [ atoms ] ) .",
    "when atoms are excited to a state for which an explicit bound - free cross section is not available , we assign them the cross section of the highest available state .    to estimate the line opacity we use a list of energy levels from the hartree - fock modeling . because of uncertainty in the energy level computations",
    ", line energies may be in error by as much as 10% , but the general distribution of bound - bound transitions is representative of the true spectrum .",
    "we focus here on dipole allowed transitions , which obey the selection rules @xmath116 for even @xmath117 , and @xmath118 for odd @xmath119 ( ruder et al .",
    "we find that in the adiabatic approximation , the energy level spectra for individual ions are roughly self - similar .",
    "therefore , for each ionization state we use the @xmath118 , @xmath120 transition of the outermost ground state electron , which we always have , to ( linearly ) re - scale the most extensive line energy lists available ( for @xmath121 at the lower field , @xmath122 at the higher ) and apply it to the ion . for most ions",

    ", we estimate the number of missing lines for each excited state and assign the ground - state line spectrum to the unaccounted - for fraction . while we have not computed the oscillator strengths for all transitions in detail , we can estimate the line opacity by noting that the strengths , defined by @xmath123 , take on characteristic sizes for the different transitions . furthermore",
    ", the type of transition determines to which component of the polarization basis the line couples .",
    "we use @xmath124couples to@xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) ; @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) ; and @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) for the oscillator strengths at @xmath32 g . for @xmath33",
    "g , the corresponding strengths are @xmath131 ( @xmath126 ) ; @xmath132 ( @xmath128 ) ; and @xmath133 ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "these oscillator strengths are accurate to within a factor of @xmath134 , which is sufficient for our modeling needs .",
    "we include two very different broadening mechanisms in our calculation .",
    "first , at the high densities and temperatures characteristic of neutron star atmospheres , line features experience significant collisional broadening . for an electron in an orbital of characteristic radius @xmath135 about a nucleus of charge z , the energy shift due to the dipole induced by an external electric field @xmath136 is @xmath137 . for collisional impact",
    ", we have @xmath138 , and @xmath139 the net charge interior to the electron absorbing the photon .",
    "we use the weisskopf method to approximate the broadening , since the impinging electrons are confined by the magnetic field to move in a straight line , giving a lorentzian cross - section with width @xmath140 ^ 2\\ ; { \\rm ev}\\;\\;,\\ ] ] which comes from the amplitude and @xmath141-dependence of @xmath142 ( see mihalas 1978 ) . for @xmath135",
    "we use the largest dimension of initial or final state , with dimension @xmath43 transverse to the field as given in  [ atoms ] , and @xmath143 parallel to the field estimated as follows .",
    "orbitals with @xmath144 are localized near the nucleus ; we need their @xmath143 only if it is bigger than @xmath43 , in which case it is given , through minimizing the total energy of an annular charge distribution , by @xmath145 ( e.g. meszaros 1992  2.4 ) . for @xmath40",
    "we estimate @xmath146 ^ 2 $ ] , which comes analytically from the schrdinger equation for @xmath147 (  [ atoms ] ) for odd @xmath19 states of hydrogen at high field ( ruder et al . 1994 , ",
    "since energies vary smoothly with @xmath19 regardless of parity , both in that work and in ours , we use the above estimate for even @xmath19 also .",
    "secondly , the thermal motion of the ions past the large @xmath3 also causes significant energy level perturbations ( pavlov & meszaros 1993 ) .",
    "we can approximate this effect by a lorentz electric field @xmath148 , where @xmath149 is the velocity transverse to the magnetic field .",
    "as in the case of hydrogen , we take this ` magnetic broadening ' to be one - sided , since the lorentz field always results in elongation of the otherwise circular transverse wave function .",
    "we estimate the energy shift as above by @xmath150 , taking @xmath135 to be the larger @xmath43 of initial and final state , since @xmath136 must be transverse to @xmath3 . using @xmath151",
    "we get @xmath152 cgs , yielding a width of @xmath153 making proper allowance for the higher thermal velocity of hydrogen , equation ( [ magwid ] ) agrees with the numerical example in pavlov & meszaros ( 1993 ) within a factor of 2 .",
    "note that since it is independent of density , magnetic broadening is most important near the surface of our atmospheres .",
    "we add the two broadening mechanisms , giving a redward half - lorentzian with width @xmath154 , and a blue line wing with width @xmath155 .",
    "the line profile , normalized to the @xmath156 as above , is thus @xmath157 @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the line energy . as this net broadening is sufficient to blend many of the lines , the exact values of the line energies are not crucial in estimating the b - b contribution to the overall opacity .",
    "when our atmosphere calculation calls for the radiative opacity in each mode at a given angle and frequency , for some ambient temperature and density , we sum the scattering , free - free , bound - free and bound - bound @xmath44 cross sections for that frequency over all ionization and excitation states weighted by ( [ kherson ] ) at the appropriate temperature and density , giving @xmath160 .",
    "the mode cross - sections are then given by @xmath161 we convert these from @xmath162/particle to @xmath162/g , and multiply by the density to get the opacity @xmath163 in @xmath164 .",
    "to illustrate the relative importance of different contributions to the opacity , we show opacity spectra for the two normal modes at @xmath165 to the magnetic field , under characteristic atmosphere conditions .",
    "free - free opacity dominates at low energies , but b - f and b - b processes contribute significant opacity at higher energies ; electron scattering is never significant in these fe atmospheres .",
    "the magnetic field , at an angle @xmath166 to the atmosphere normal , causes significant anisotropies in the energy transfer .",
    "in addition , zps96 have shown that even without a field there can be substantial limb darkening and that the emergent spectrum will vary with @xmath167 the cosine of the viewing angle to the atmosphere normal .",
    "for emission from a small region on the star , these effects will cause substantial variation with the viewing angle .",
    "we therefore follow the angular dependence of both internal radiation field and emergent spectrum , although our atmosphere temperature structure remains plane parallel .",
    "we define a grid of angular co - ordinates @xmath168 about the magnetic field direction . given the state of the atmosphere at each depth , we use the opacities of  3 to compute frequency- and @xmath90- dependent optical depths , by summing @xmath169 from the surface to atmosphere layer number @xmath170 , for each theta in our grid .",
    "this precedes any consideration of the atmosphere normal direction , and the sums are done using the normal thickness @xmath171 of each layer .",
    "we next compute radiation fields at each @xmath90 and @xmath22 at a given atmosphere level .",
    "the intensity of outward going radiation is given by @xmath172 = \\int^\\infty_{\\tau_j } [ b_\\omega(\\tau')/2 ]   e^{-(\\tau ' - \\tau_j)/\\mu } { \\rm d}\\tau'/\\mu \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; ( 0 \\le \\mu \\le 1)\\ ] ] and inward going radiation by @xmath173 = \\int^{\\tau_j}_0 [ b_\\omega(\\tau')/2 ] e^{-(\\tau_j - \\tau')/(-\\mu ) } { \\rm d}\\tau'/(-\\mu)\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;(-1 \\le \\mu \\le 0)\\ ] ] where @xmath174 ( taking the normal direction to have @xmath175 by definition ) and @xmath176 $ ] is the planck function , half of which gives the source function in each mode for lte .",
    "when @xmath177 in a given layer we use the diffusion approximation for that frequency and mode : @xmath178 = b_\\omega[\\tau_j(\\omega,\\theta ) ] + \\mu \\partial b_\\omega /\\partial \\tau_j(\\omega,\\theta)$ ] .",
    "the intensities are then summed to find the astrophysical flux @xmath179 .",
    "we find that 18 zones in @xmath90 and 9 zones in @xmath22 ( zero to @xmath180 only , by symmetry ) give better than 0.1% accuracy in the intensity integral even for test functions with rapid variations in @xmath90 and @xmath22 . to monitor atmosphere flux",
    "the above computations are performed on 200 energy bins , logarithmically spaced between 1ev and 10kev .",
    "electron thermal conduction provides a significant component of the heat flux at large depth in our coolest atmosphere models .",
    "the electron thermal conductivity is significantly modified under high field conditions ( hernquist 1985 ) . because the electron gas in our atmospheres is non - degenerate ( see  [ eos ] ) , and occupies only the lowest landau level , the conductivity @xmath181 ( hernquist s @xmath182 ) along @xmath16 can be readily computed by evaluating the integrals in hernquist s eq ( 3.5 ) , using ( 3.8 ) and ( 3.10 ) .",
    "the chemical potential is given by ( 2.12 ) , and its derivative required by ( 3.10c ) is taken analytically .",
    "electron conduction perpendicular to @xmath3 will be much smaller , and we take it to be zero .",
    "we find that in our coldest @xmath33 g atmosphere , in which it is most significant , the electron conductivity carries up to 80% of the heat flux at @xmath183 ( defined below ) .",
    "the extra mode of transport affects the temperature structures and emergent spectra significantly .",
    "deep within the atmosphere , the optical depths are large for _ all _ frequency bins , and radiation flows in the diffusion limit with flux @xmath184 .",
    "we therefore define a radiative mean opacity @xmath185\\ ] ] equivalent to the rosseland mean opacity ; the corresponding optical depth scale is @xmath186 .",
    "the total mean opacity is then given by @xmath187 , where @xmath188 gives the effective conductive contribution .",
    "this total opacity defines a useful depth scale @xmath189 , as the temperature structure tends to the grey solution at large depth on this scale .",
    "our atmospheres have 146 depth zones with @xmath190 ; the very low @xmath78 layers are required by the extreme frequency and angle dependence of our opacities .    as usual",
    "we relate the optical depth zones to physical depths by summing the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium down from the surface : @xmath191{\\rm d}\\tau_{\\rm t}$ ] . because @xmath192 , we solve iteratively for the physical zone size ( _ cf . _ rr96 ) .",
    "we then evaluate the total radiative flux @xmath193 as above at each depth zone , and add the conductive heat flow @xmath194 to obtain the total energy flux at each depth .",
    "this is adjusted to the constant flux solution , using the lucy - uns@xmath195ld temperature correction scheme , as in rr96 .",
    "we iterate until flux errors are @xmath196% throughout the atmospheres .    in the surface layers",
    ", we also consider the behavior of @xmath197 .",
    "although convergence to @xmath198 is a useful diagnostic , we find that a simple @xmath199 iteration scheme using @xmath200 , as suggested by shibanov et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , provides no help in reaching convergence .",
    "full scale feautrier schemes could , however , speed convergence considerably .",
    "as noted above , both angle dependent specific angular fluxes and the total emergent spectrum are of interest .",
    "these are computed from equation ( [ i_trans_out ] ) at the surface layer at @xmath201 log - spaced energies for higher spectral resolution .",
    "we converge atmospheres with effective temperatures @xmath202 and @xmath203k , with vertical ( @xmath204 ) magnetic fields of @xmath6 and @xmath205 gauss . to examine the dependences on magnetic geometry",
    ", we also converge atmospheres with @xmath206 and @xmath207 at @xmath208k for both field strengths .",
    "figure 2 gives the temperature structure computed for the @xmath204 atmospheres .",
    "open circles show the locations of the mean radiative optical depths 1 and 10 , labeled with the average ionization level @xmath77 at these points .",
    "the temperature structure may be compared with background curves showing @xmath209 and @xmath210 ; the depth zones dominating the spectrum lie in the gaseous non - degenerate regime .",
    "figure 3 shows the emergent spectra for the normal field atmospheres  these can be compared with the corresponding blackbodies . as in romani ( 1987 ) , rr96 and zps96",
    "we see that the rich absorption spectrum of the heavy element gives an overall opacity trend much flatter than the steep kramer s law fall - off of h and he .",
    "this assures that the spectra are globally closer to a blackbody shape than the light element atmospheres .",
    "in fact , the bound - free edges at @xmath211kev provide a large increase in opacity that gives fe spectral _ deficits _ above the wien peak .",
    "qualitatively , this is similar to the effect of l - edge absorptions in non - magnetic iron ( rr96 ) .",
    "looking at the opacities and at the absorption features in the spectra , one can see that the magnetic fe transitions are divided , roughly , into two energy ranges : @xmath212 transitions below @xmath213ev ( for our lower field ) and all other transitions , mostly at energies above 300ev .",
    "interestingly , for typical neutron star magnetic fields these transitions are at energies roughly comparable to the m- and l - shell transitions in non - magnetic fe .",
    "the resulting spectral shapes therefore have some similarities to non - magnetic iron .",
    "note that we do not expect the detailed line positions in our atmospheres to be accurate ; the general appearance of these emergent spectra should however be similar to more accurate results .",
    "although more complete atomic data should give an even richer line spectrum , we do find that certain species dominate at depths where the lines are forming .",
    "thus high resolution x - ray spectra can in principal extract useful information about the fe atmosphere structure .",
    "in particular , the rather strong line broadening , most visible at low e , does not prevent discrete lines from being visible at higher energies . at low energies lines",
    "are also visible , but equivalent widths are questionable because of uncertainty in the detailed temperature structure in the very low @xmath78 surface layers .    in figure 3",
    "we also show the contributions of the two normal modes to the emergent flux at each temperature . while we do not discuss it in detail here , it is clear that the thermal emission will show a strong energy dependent polarization .",
    "this polarization also depends on the magnetic field geometry ; thermal polarization from neutron star surfaces should be pulsed at the star s spin period .    in practice",
    ", we expect quite substantial variation of the emergent spectrum over the surface .",
    "if due to a coherent dipole , the variation of magnetic field strength and orientation will affect the bulk flow of thermal flux from the interior to the star surface .",
    "for example shibanov and yakovlev ( 1996 ) indicate an effective temperature decrease as large as @xmath214 from the magnetic pole to the magnetic equator for a @xmath205 g , @xmath215k neutron star .",
    "such temperature dependence implies large thermal emissivity variation with viewing angle . for a given @xmath2",
    "we find that the broadband spectral dependence on @xmath166 is quite modest ( see also pavlov , et al .",
    "however , for a surface with varying @xmath216 , including the spectral dependence imposed by an atmosphere ( e.g. as modeled for geminga by meyer , pavlov and meszaros 1994 ) can give a complex , energy dependent pulse behavior .",
    "in fact , spectral features are quite dependent on the magnetic field strength ( figure 3 ) . at a minimum ,",
    "even if the large scale dipole dominates the field at the surface , there will be a factor of two difference in @xmath3 between the magnetic equator and the magnetic poles .",
    "higher order multipole contributions are also possible ; the large field variations will blur any spectral features significantly .",
    "finally in addition to the magnetic field variation and effective temperature variation , there will be a significant modulation of the neutron star thermal spectrum with changes of the observer s viewing angle to an emitting region on the stellar surface .",
    "zps96 have emphasized the ` limb darkening ' decrease in the emitted flux with increasing @xmath217 for non - magnetic atmospheres . in magnetized atmospheres",
    "the @xmath217 dependence can be extremely complicated in general .",
    "one basic effect is visible below @xmath218kev in the normal field case of figure 4 ; here one of the two normal modes has a significant @xmath21 polarization component , which experiences a much higher continuum opacity unsuppressed by the field .",
    "the opacity increase acts in concert with the usual limb darkening to diminish the flux at small @xmath217 . for tangential @xmath219 , on the other hand , when @xmath220 in the @xmath16-@xmath221 plane both normal modes are primarily @xmath222 , resulting in strongly suppressed continuum opacity .",
    "the extra transparency counteracts the limb darkening to some extent ; the emissivity varies little below 0.1kev in the right panel of figure 4 .",
    "thus a simple dipole field neutron star would have a relatively bright limb at low @xmath31 when viewed along the magnetic axis .",
    "however , other effects can complicate this simplest picture .",
    "first , the lines and line wings can couple selectively to a single polarization component , and block out the modes transparent to the continuum .",
    "secondly , when @xmath223 , the normal modes are circularly polarized and similar to one another , both containing small amounts of the @xmath21 component ; while for @xmath224 the modes are linearly polarized , and the mode perpendicular to the @xmath3-@xmath225 plane is almost completely @xmath21-free .",
    "thus when the @xmath21 opacity excess is too extreme , the @xmath21-free mode can have larger intensity at small @xmath217 than both modes together at @xmath223 .",
    "this effect is visible above 0.2 kev in fig .",
    "4 , where strong line wings are coupled to the @xmath21 component . in some cases even the continuum - controlled thermal peaks are dominated by this effect ; however , any small change in normal mode composition can modify this behavior",
    ". clearly models of purely thermal pulsed emission from neutron stars can be complex , with effective temperature , line feature position and limb darkening behavior controlled by the local magnetic geometry .",
    "these effects may be somewhat blurred by gravitational defocusing of the emergent radiation ( page 1995 ) , but substantial variation in the atmosphere features and overall emissivity are expected as the star rotates .",
    "our models suggest that if pulsars possess iron atmospheres , upcoming high throughput , moderate resolution spectroscopy missions such as xmm and axaf will have a wealth of spectral features for diagnosis of atmosphere temperature structure and magnetic geometry .",
    "data providing such rich spectra will certainly motivate more complete magnetic fe models .",
    "improvement of the atomic data sets used to generate the opacities will be essential for such models .",
    "even exhaustive lists of configurations and lines , though , will have to be coupled with a more sophisticated treatment of the non - ideal equation of state , along the lines of an activity expansion of the grand canonical ensemble ( rogers 1986 ) , or an occupation probability formalism ( hummer & mihalas 1988 ) .",
    "both these approaches , which have been used for non - magnetic plasma opacity calculations by the opal and op collaborations respectively , avoid the somewhat ad hoc cutoff procedures necessary in using equation ( [ kherson ] ) .",
    "a fully consistent opacity / eos system will also need to include the effects of plasma non - ideality on atomic ( b - f and b - b ) opacity .",
    "this will require calculation of states and energies of non - isolated atoms , desirable but prohibitively difficult at present .",
    "for the line opacities , the dipole selection rules and simple coupling of each line to a single polarization component are known to be a first approximation only , subject to complication by all forms of broadening .",
    "presumably more detailed atomic modeling will address these topics , and produce more precise oscillator strengths as well . finally , more realistic magnetic geometries and inclusion of ( weak ) mode coupling through scattering will have some effect on the emergent flux . nonetheless , we expect our magnetic models have captured the qualitative behavior of heavy element atmospheres . in simplest terms",
    "this is that the wealth of spectral features bring the overall spectrum shape closer to a blackbody than for light element surfaces .",
    "as in rr96 , we can illustrate these broad band spectral effects by simulating a modest statistic ( 3000 count ) pspc exposure of a neutron star , whose absorbed spectrum is fitted by a blackbody . comparing",
    "the inferred @xmath226 with the true @xmath2 for various atmosphere models illustrates the low resolution spectral effects ( figure 5 ) . as for non - magnetic atmospheres , the fe results are much softer for a given @xmath2 than h atmospheres .",
    "in contrast , existing data suggest phase average spectra appreciably harder than the corresponding blackbody . while the clear existence of magnetospheric flux contributions and the likely @xmath2 variations over the surface complicate the interpretation",
    ", it would seem that these data support the existence of light element atmospheres on neutron star surfaces .",
    "if substantiated , this conclusion would give important clues to the history of the neutron star surface and serious implications for cooling curves and the equation of state of matter at high density . the magnetic model fe atmospheres produced in this paper are of sufficient quality to allow selection between h models and fe models for pulsar x - ray surface emission .",
    "if h atmospheres are preferred , the sophisticated modeling possible for this simple species will allow detailed interpretation of soft x - ray spectra .",
    "if however , fe models remain acceptable , further careful study of the behavior of highly magnetized iron under neutron star surface conditions will be strongly motivated .",
    "we thank g. g. pavlov for supplying the sample magnetic h model spectra and for giving a careful and detailed critique of this paper .",
