    "the discoveries provoke consideration of new and/or more complex models for dwarf galaxy evolution , for the relation between dwarfs and larger ( usually parent ) galaxies , the connection between dwarfs and subhalos seen in @xmath7cdm simulations , and the properties of large , @xmath8 * galaxies themselves .    despite the variety , all of the newfound dwarf systems ( but one",

    "this continues the observational trend that classical lg dsphs are associated with the lg spirals whereas dirrs are less correlated to them , and supports the idea that dsph galaxy evolution includes `` harassment '' ( mayer et al .  2001a ,",

    "several newfound dwarfs ( e.g. , willman i , ursa major ii , canes venatici , botes ) show evidence for tidal disruption ( belokurov et al .",

    "the number of newly found systems , and their inferred , often very high ( e.g. , kleyna et al .",
    "2005 ; muoz et al .",
    "2006a ) dm fractions , have important implications for hierarchical galaxy formation models , if the satellite galaxies are related to `` subhalos '' seen in @xmath7cdm models of structure formation on galaxy - sized scales .",
    "for example , the `` missing satellites '' gap between predicted and known subhalos ( moore et al .",
    "1999 ; klypin et al .",
    "1999 ) may be less pronounced than previously believed and thus our understanding of galaxy formation on the smallest scales and at the earliest times may need revising ( e.g. , bullock et al .  2000 ,",
    "benson et al .",
    "2002 , taylor et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "satellite galaxies also trace the gravitational extent of their parent halos .",
    "velocity - distance distributions of satellites have long been used to constrain parent system masses through the jeans equation ( e.g. , hartwick & sargent 1978 ; frenk & white 1980 ; zaritsky et al .",
    "1989 ; sakamoto et al .  2003",

    "such analyses have recently yielded some surprising results , particularly that the m31 virial mass may be smaller than previously thought , more similar to  or possibly even less than  that of the mw ( e.g. , ct et al .",

    "this result , however , suggests a rather lower @xmath9 for m31 than mw , since it is now clear ( guhathakurta et al .",
    "2005 ; kalirai et al .",
    "2006 ) that m31 s inner , metal - rich spheroid dominates its outer , metal - poor halo ( ostheimer 2003 ; chapman et al .  2005 ;",

    "a newly discovered dwarf galaxy found during our survey of the outermost parts of m31 challenges the prevailing `` small mass '' models for m31 .",
    "this dwarf , `` andromeda xiv ( andxiv ) '' , is a dynamical rogue with the largest @xmath10 moment  by at least a factor of four  of any satellite ever suspected of being a part of the m31 system .",

    "7 ) shows two compact high velocity clouds near andxiv , but whose rvs differ from that of andxiv by @xmath24 and @xmath25 km s@xmath5 . the currently fit structural properties , lack of obvious very young stars ( i.e. a `` blue plume '' ) , and apparently no corresponding all suggest andxiv is a dsph galaxy .    from the rgb _ shape _ the andxiv distance is uncertain due to a degeneracy of isochrone fits for varying metallicities to what is only the top 1.5 mag of rgb in figure 1b .",
    "based on the @xmath26 magnitude of the tip of the rgb , the [ fe / h]=@xmath27 , @xmath28 isochrone seems the best match to the data .",
    "we ( g07 ) are in the process of refining the andxiv metallicity estimates using the keck spectra .",
    "fortunately , however , the absolute @xmath29 magnitude of the rgb tip varies by only @xmath30 over @xmath31[fe / h]@xmath32 ( bellazzini et al .",
    "the brightest rv member has @xmath33 whereas the brightest rgb _ candidate _",
    "1b ) has @xmath34 ; thus , the andxiv distance modulus plausibly ranges from @xmath35 ( 630 kpc ) to 24.65 ( 850 kpc ) , _ if _ the rgb tip is populated in this low mass system .",
    "deeper imaging of andxiv will clarify its age , metallicity and distance .",
    "we estimate the andxiv luminosity by comparison of its luminosity function in the top 1.5 mag of its rgb to that of other , galactic dsphs studied in the same photometric system and using the same techniques .",
    "comparison to the carina dsph rgb ( muoz et al .",
    "2006b )  a system with [ fe / h ] @xmath36  yields an andxiv luminosity of @xmath37 @xmath38 ( for an adopted carina @xmath39 @xmath38 ) .",
    "comparison to the rgb ( p03 ) of the more metal poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath40 ) ursa minor dsph ( with @xmath41 @xmath38 ) yields an andxiv luminosity of @xmath42 @xmath38 .",
    "setting a minimum mass on m31 depends crucially on the distance to andxiv , if this satellite is bound to its parent .",
    "figure 5 shows the best - fitting m31 mass model ( baryons+dm ) , represented as the escape velocity as a function of deprojected ( 3d ) radius from m31 s center , from s07 .",
    "this analysis uses published h@xmath43 and rotation data extending to @xmath4435 kpc to determine a cosmologically - motivated m31 mass profile .",
    "the s07 model also allows for adiabatic contraction in an initial nfw halo , and is truncated at @xmath44260 kpc , which is the best estimated virial radius ( @xmath45 ) for m31 .",
    "the dashed lines in figure 5 represent the @xmath46 range for the best - fitting s07 adiabatic contraction models in _ both _ halo concentration ( @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the scale length ; bullock et al .",
    "2001 ) _ and _ virial mass : ( @xmath49)=(17.8 , @xmath50 ) and ( 22.2 , @xmath51 ) .",
    "the median ( solid ) line corresponds to the best - fitting case with ( @xmath49)=(20 , @xmath52 ) .",
    "this median mass is similar to , but slightly higher than , virial masses based upon satellite kinematics ( e.g. , @xmath53 ; ct et al .",
    "2000 ; geehan et al .   2006 ) .",
    "both methods yield masses consistent with expectations for a galaxy with m31 luminosity , where one would expect a range @xmath54 based on the 2df luminosity function and correlation function ( van den bosch et al .",
    "the virial mass presented in the @xmath7cdm model of klypin et al .",
    "( 2002 ) is about 60% higher than that of s07 , i.e. closer to the median of the above range . the difference is primarily driven by the fact that s07 use the 3.6-@xmath55 m spitzer image of m31 ( barmby et al .",
    "2006 ) to determine the baryonic mass distribution , whereas klypin et al .",
    "( 2002 ) used optical light .",
    "one might therefore expect the analysis presented in s07 to be an improvement over the klypin et al .",
    "( 2002 ) model .",
    "the rvs ( reduced to a common projection parallel to the m31-mw vector ; ct et al .",
    "2000 ) of all commonly attributed m31 satellites and more recent satellite discoveries with relevant data are indicated in figure 5 . in most cases ,",
    "these rvs are less than half escape velocity : in contrast , the reduced rv lower limit for andxiv of @xmath56 km s@xmath5  even at andxiv s _ projected _ 162 kpc m31 distance  already places andxiv beyond the nominal s07 model escape velocity limit . because figure 5 ignores the unknown orthogonal velocity components , each point only _ approximates _ each satellite s minimum 3-d relative velocity ; in principle , the latter can be overestimated for widely separated satellites if the _ m31 system _ has a large bulk tangential motion that projects to a substantial rv along the line of sight to the satellite .",
    "however , both the `` timing argument '' and arguments based on m33 water maser proper motions coupled with no apparent m31 tidal disruption of m33 s disk suggest a @xmath57 km s@xmath5 m31 transverse velocity , with a northerly motion more strongly ruled out ( loeb et al .",
    "2005 ) ; this upper limit ( and discordant direction of motion ) suggests little contribution of m31 tangential motion to andxiv s rv .    on the other hand ,",
    "considering that two components of andxiv s individual velocity are not being accounted for in figure 5 and that the 3d distance of andxiv from m31 likely exceeds 162 kpc , one is forced to conclude either that ( 1 ) the prevailing estimates of the m31 virial mass need upward revision by likely significant amounts , or ( 2 ) andxiv is presently falling into the m31 potential for the first time .",
    "there is no significant known galactic mass anywhere along any likely backward - extrapolated andxiv trajectory over the last hubble time if andxiv is not bound to m31 .",
    "andxiv lies @xmath58 south of and xiii , the southernmost of four m31 satellites found by m06 .",
    "based on the coincidences that ( 1 ) these four satellites lie within @xmath59 of one another despite the 57 deg@xmath60 m06 survey area , and ( 2 ) the metallicities , sizes and luminosities of the m06 dsphs are similar , m06 speculate on a possible linked origin for the group .",
    "though @xmath61 from the centroid of m06 objects , andxiv does continue to larger radius an alignment of all five objects along a radial vector from m31 s center .",
    "indeed , all five objects , _ as well as _ ngc147 , ngc185 , ngc205 , m32 , and and i , lie @xmath62 ( @xmath63 kpc projected distance ) from this same vector across a 19@xmath64 ( 260 kpc ) projected span . though still very uncertain , andxiv may have a similar distance and metallicity as the m06 group ; however , it is clear that andxiv is several times larger and brighter than the m06 dsphs . testing a possible association of andxiv to the m06 objects , and",
    "indeed all of these objects to other potential `` dynamical families '' suggested for m31 satellites ( koch & grebel 2006 ; mcconnachie & irwin 2006 ; metz et al .",
    "2007 ) , requires velocities for the m06 objects and more accurate distances to all five systems .",
    "andxiv may provide a unique laboratory for lg astrophysics .",
    "if bound to m31 , andxiv s distance sets a critical lower limit to m31 s mass , just as the inclusion of the distant and high velocity leo i dsph as a bound member of the milky way strongly affects estimations of its mass ( e.g. , zaritsky et al .",
    "1989 ; but cf .",

    "geha et al .",
    "( 2006 ) show that external forces seem necessary for complete removal of gas from dwarf galaxies .",
    "andxiv s lack of gas and its elongated , low concentration structure may point to significant environmental ( e.g. , ram pressure , tidal ) effects .",
    "the discovery of andxiv tidal tails would provide critical additional proof that it is a true m31 satellite . on the other hand ,",
    "if demonstrably unbound to m31 , andxiv would join tucana , and possibly leo i ( though see sohn et al .",
    "2007 ) , as an unusual lg dsph having no prior association with a large spiral and demonstrate that dsphs can form in isolation without harrassment (  1 ) . in this case",
