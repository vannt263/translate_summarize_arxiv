    "inspired by the great technological importance of epitaxial crystal growth , the past decade has raised much theoretical research in the subject of _ kinetic roughening _ of surfaces during growth .",
    "the investigation of this effect , which is undesirable in practical applications , promises deep insight into statistical physics far from thermal equilibrium , see e.g. @xcite for an overview .",
    "we focus on a full - diffusion monte - carlo model of homoepitaxial growth of a hypothetical material with simple cubic lattice structure under _",
    "solid on solid _ conditions , i.e. the effects of overhangs and displacements are being neglected .",
    "then , the crystal can be described by a two - dimensional array of integers which denote the height @xmath2 of the surface .",
    "on each site , new particles are deposited with a rate @xmath3 .",
    "particles on the surface are hopping to nearest neighbour sites with arrhenius rates @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the binding energies of a particle to the substrate and to its @xmath7 nearest neighbours .",
    "@xmath8 is the attempt frequency , and @xmath9 has its usual meaning .",
    "in contrast to earlier investigations of similar models @xcite , we permit the _ desorption _ of particles from the surface with rates @xmath10 , where @xmath11 .",
    "the aim of this publication is twofold : we will first discuss the advantages of the wavelet analysis compared to the _ structure function _ ( sf )",
    "approach , which has to date solely been used in the investigation of multiaffine surfaces .",
    "then , we will apply this formalism to investigate the influence of desorption on kinetic roughening .",
    "we conclude with some remarks on the relevance of universality classes for our results .",
    "the standard approach of _ dynamic scaling _",
    "@xcite assumes that the statistical properties of a growing surface before saturation remain invariant under a simultanous transformation of spatial extension @xmath12 , heigth @xmath2 and time @xmath13 , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is an arbitrary positive constant .",
    "this implies , that a part of the surface smaller than the _ correlation length _",
    "@xmath16 can be regarded as _ self - affine _ with hurst exponent @xmath17 .",
    "a popular method of measuring @xmath17 uses heigth - heigth correlation functions of ( theoretically ) arbitrary order @xmath18 : @xmath19 where @xmath20 for @xmath21 and @xmath22 for @xmath23 . in practice",
    ", @xmath24 is the most common choice .    in principle , there are two different ways to measure @xmath17 : the _ local _ approach determines @xmath17 from the initial slope of @xmath25 versus @xmath26 for small @xmath27 .",
    "global _ approach analyzes the dependence of the _ surface width _ @xmath28 in the saturation regime on the system size @xmath29 : @xmath30 . before saturation , the surface width increases like @xmath31 , where @xmath32 .",
    "an alternative which avoids the simulation of different system sizes uses the complete functional dependence of equation [ gg ] : @xmath1 and @xmath33 are chosen such that the curves of @xmath34 versus @xmath35 collapse on a unique function @xmath36 within a large range of @xmath13 and @xmath27 .",
    "however , a careful analysis of simulation data @xcite has shown , that several models of epitaxial growth show significant deviations from this simple picture .",
    "first , one obtains different values of @xmath17 from the local than from the global approach , a phenomenon which is called _",
    "anomalous scaling_. second , one often finds _ multiscaling _ : height - height correlation functions of different order yield a hirarchy of @xmath18-dependent exponents @xmath37 , when determined from the initial power - law behaviour of @xmath38 .",
    "these observations can be interpreted within the mathematical framework of _ multifractality _ : the _ hlder exponent _",
    "@xcite @xmath39 of a function @xmath40 at @xmath41 is defined as the largest exponent such that there exists a polynomial of order @xmath42 and a constant @xmath43 which yield @xmath44 in the neighbourhood of @xmath41 .",
    "the hlder exponent is a _ local _ counterpart of the hurst exponent : a self - affine function with hurst exponent @xmath17 has @xmath45 everywhere .",
    "however , in the case of a _ multiaffine _ function different points @xmath12 might be characterized by different hlder exponents .",
    "this general case is characterized by the _ singularity spectrum _",
    "@xmath46 , which denotes the hausdorff dimension of the set of points , where @xmath47 is the hlder exponent of @xmath40 .",
    "there is a deep analogy between multifractality and thermodynamics @xcite , where the scaling exponents play the role of energy , the singularity spectrum corresponds to entropy , and @xmath18 plays the role of inverse temperature .",
    "so , theoretically @xmath46 might be calculated via a legendre transform of @xmath37 : @xmath48 @xcite , a method which has been called _ structure function _ ( sf ) approach .",
    "however , its practical application raises fundamental difficulties : first , to obtain the complete singularity spectrum , one needs @xmath37 for positive _ and _ negative @xmath18 . but",
    "as @xmath49 might become zero , @xmath50 is in principle undefined for @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , only the left , ascending part of @xmath46 is accessible to this method . additionally , the results of the sf method can easily be corrupted by polynomial trends in @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it might be due to these difficulties , that - to our knowledge - no attempt to determine the singularity spectrum of _ growing surfaces _ from @xmath37 has ever been made .",
    "although it has been argued that the @xmath37 collapse onto a single @xmath17 in the limit @xmath52 , which characterizes the asymptotic universality class of the model @xcite , we are convinced that deeper insight into fractal growth on experimentally relevant _",
    "finite _ timescales can be gained from a detailed knowledge of the @xmath46 spectrum .    to this end , we follow the strategy suggested by arnodo et .",
    "al @xcite , which circumvents the problems of the sf approach and permits a reliable measurement of the complete @xmath46 .",
    "mathematically , the wavelet transform of a function @xmath2 of two variables is defined as its convolution with the complex conjugate of the wavelet @xmath53 , which is _ dilated _ with the _ scale _ @xmath54 and rotated by an angle @xmath55 @xcite : @xmath56 ( \\vec{b } , \\theta , a ) = c_{\\psi}^{-1/2 } a^{-2 } \\int d^{2}x \\ ; \\psi^{*}(a^{-1 } \\mathbf{r_{-\\theta } } ( \\vec{x } - \\vec{b } ) ) f(\\vec{x } ) .",
    "\\label{wgen}\\ ] ] here @xmath57 is the usual 2-dimensional rotation matrix , and @xmath58 in fourier space . apart from this constraint , the wavelet can ( in principle ) be an arbitrary complex - valued function . introducing the wavelet @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is an arbitrary unit vector , one obtains easily @xmath61(\\vec{b } , \\theta , a ) = c_{\\psi_{\\delta}}^{-1/2 } \\left [   f(\\vec{b } ) - f(\\vec{b } + a \\mathbf{r_{\\theta } } \\vec{n } ) \\right ] ~ \\rightarrow   ~ \\int d^{2}b \\left| t_{\\psi_{\\delta}}[f](\\vec{b }",
    ", \\theta , a)\\right|^{q } \\propto   g(q , a \\mathbf{r_{\\theta } } \\vec{n } ) .",
    "\\label{tg}\\ ] ] consequently , a calculation of the moments of the wavelet transform of the surface yields the sf approach as a special case . to avoid its weaknesses , two major improvements are necessary",
    ":    first , we use a class of wavelets with a greater number of _ vanishing moments _ @xmath62 than @xmath63 .",
    "this increases the range of accessible hlder exponents and improves the insensitivity to polynomial trends in @xmath2 .",
    "we introduce a two - component version of the wavelet transform @xmath64 ( \\vec{b } , a ) = \\frac{1}{a^{2 } } \\int d^{2}x \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } \\psi_{1}(a^{-1 } ( \\vec{x } - \\vec{b } ) ) \\\\",
    "\\psi_{2}(a^{-1 } ( \\vec{x } - \\vec{b } ) ) \\end{array } \\right ) f(\\vec{x } ) \\ ; ,   \\label{wspec}\\ ] ] where the analyzing wavelets @xmath65 , @xmath66 are defined as partial derivatives of a radially symmetrical convolution function @xmath67 : @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "then @xmath70(\\vec{b } , a)$ ] can be written as the gradient of @xmath2 , smoothed with a filter @xmath71 w.r.t .",
    "this definition becomes a special case of equation [ wgen ] , when multiplied with @xmath73 , yet allows for an easier numerical computation has been omitted ] .",
    "for example , @xmath71 can be a gaussian , where @xmath74 , or @xmath75 , which has two vanishing moments .",
    "second , the integration over @xmath72 in equation [ tg ] is undefined for @xmath51 , since the wavelet coefficients might become zero .",
    "the basic idea is to replace it with a discrete summation over an appropriate partition of the wavelet transform which obtains nonzero values only , but preserves the relevant information on the hlder regularity of @xmath2 . in the following",
    ", we will give a brief outline of the rather involved algorithm and refer the reader to @xcite for more details and a mathematical proof .",
    "the _ wavelet transform modulus maxima _ ( wtmm ) are defined as local maxima of the modulus @xmath76(\\vec{b } , a ) : = |\\vec{t}_{\\vec{\\psi}}[f](\\vec{b } , a)|$ ] in the direction of @xmath70(\\vec{b } , a)$ ] for fixed @xmath54 .",
    "these wtmm lie on connected curves , which trace structures of size @xmath77 on the surface .",
    "the strength of each is characterized by the _",
    "maximal _ value of @xmath76(\\vec{b } , a)$ ] along the line , the so - called _ wavelet transform modulus maxima maximum _ ( wtmmm ) @xcite .",
    "while proceeding from large to small @xmath54 , successively smaller structures are resolved .",
    "connecting the wtmmm at different scales yields the set @xmath78 of maxima lines @xmath27 , which lead to the locations of the singularities of @xmath2 in the limit @xmath79 .",
    "the partition functions @xmath80(\\vec{b } , a ' ) \\right)^{q } \\sim a^{\\tau(q ) } \\ ; \\mbox{for } \\ ; a \\rightarrow 0\\ ] ] are defined on the subset @xmath81 of lines which cross the scale @xmath54 . from the analogy between the multifractal formalism and thermodynamics ,",
    "@xmath46 is calculated via a legendre transform of the exponents @xmath82 , which characterize the scaling behaviour of @xmath83 on small scales @xmath54 : @xmath84 .",
    "additionally , @xmath82 itself has a physical meaning for some @xmath18 : @xmath85 is the fractal dimension of the set of points where @xmath86 , while the fractal dimension of the surface @xmath2 itself equals @xmath87 .",
    "( 1,0.4)(0,0 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 0.52,0 )    in our simulations , we choose the parameters @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , and a temperature @xmath91 .",
    "to study the influence of desorption , we consider three models with different activation energies @xmath92 : in model a desorption is forbidden , i.e. @xmath93 . models b and c have @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "we simulate the deposition of @xmath96 monolayers at a growth rate of one monolayer per second on a lattice of @xmath97 unit cells using periodic boundary conditions , our standard value being @xmath98 .",
    "to check for finite size effects , we have also simulated @xmath99 . in",
    "all presented results averages over 6 independent simulation runs have been performed .",
    "although we have used an optimized algorithm , these simulations consumed several weeks of cpu time on our workstation cluster .",
    "first , we have checked our results for artifacts resulting from properties of the analyzing wavelet rather than from the analyzed surface by using different convolution functions @xmath100 : @xmath101 is the gaussian function , @xmath102 are products of gaussians and polynomials , which have been chosen in a way that the first @xmath7 moments vanish . then , the analyzing wavelets have @xmath103 vanishing moments . we find ( figure [ eins ] a ) , that the @xmath82-curve obtained with @xmath101 deviates significantly from those obtained with @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the latter agree apart from small differences which are mainly due to the discrete sampling of the wavelet in the numerical implementation of the algorithm .",
    "this is explained by the theoretical result @xcite that @xmath107 for @xmath108 if the number of vanishing moments of the analyzing wavelet is too small .",
    "consequently , the agreement of the other curves proves their physical relevance .",
    "figure [ eins ] b shows averages of @xmath82 curves obtained with the convolution functions @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 from surfaces after @xmath109 of growth on an initially flat substrate . for all our models , their nonlinear behaviour reflects the multiaffine surface morphology . from the fact that these curves are reproduced within statistical errors in simulations with @xmath99 , we conclude that finite size effects can be neglected .",
    "clearly , desorption reduces the slope of @xmath82 , although only a small fraction of the incoming particles is desorbed : @xmath110 in model b and @xmath111 in model c with slightly higher values at earlier times .",
    "( 1,0.4)(0,0 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 0.52,0 )    the corresponding singularity spectra are shown in figure [ zwei ] a. they have a typical shape whose descending part seems to be symmetrical to the ascending part and which changes at most slightly , while the whole spectra are shifted towards smaller hlder exponents as desorption becomes more important .",
    "we emphasize that we find no evidence for a _ time dependence _ of the singularity spectra within the range @xmath112 , so that our results do _ not _ support the idea of an asymptotic regime characterized by a single exponent @xmath17 .",
    "however , the accessible time range of computer simulations is limited , so that we can not finally disprove the existence of such a regime .",
    "the multifractal formalism has replaced the unique scaling exponent @xmath17 of _ spatial extension _ in the simple picture of dynamic scaling ( equation [ dynamisch ] ) with a wide spectrum of hlder exponents . by analogy",
    ", one might find it necessary to replace the scaling exponent @xmath113 with a distribution of _ temporal _ counterparts of @xmath47 . to answer this question , we investigate the propability distribution function ( pdf ) @xmath114 of surface heights .",
    "dynamical scale invariance with a single @xmath113 demands that @xmath115 i.e. the rescaled pdfs @xmath116 should collapse onto a single function @xmath117 when plotted as a function of @xmath118 within a large time range",
    ".    we measure @xmath113 from the increase of the surface width with time , which follows a power law for @xmath119 in models a and b ( @xmath120 , @xmath121 ) respectively @xmath122 in model c ( @xmath123 ) , which then starts to approach the final _",
    "saturation regime_. the high quality of the data collapse of the pdfs shown in figure [ zwei ] b proves that the scaling form [ bkollaps ] holds , showing that a _ single _",
    "exponent describes the scaling behaviour of @xmath114 .",
    "this parallels the finding of krug in @xcite for the one - dimensional das sarma - tamborenea model .",
    "finally , the wtmm method , which is a precise tool to investigate _ local _ scaling properties of surfaces might help to get some insight into the phenomenon of _ anomalous scaling_. the conventional picture @xcite notes the difference between the global @xmath1 and a `` local @xmath17 '' which is determined from the power - law behaviour of @xmath124 for small @xmath27 , and , within the multifractal formalism , simply corresponds to a hlder exponent on the ascending part of the singularity spectrum . we have determined the _ global _ scaling exponents @xmath1 and @xmath33 from the data collapse of the scaled height - height correlation function @xmath124 and find agreement within statistical errors between @xmath1 and that value of the hlder exponent @xmath125 which _ maxmizes _ @xmath46 ( table [ tabelle ] ) .",
    "this empirical result can be explained with a saddle - point argument : we calculate the surface width @xmath126 since @xmath127 grows like @xmath128 with the system size , in large systems the integral over @xmath129 will be dominated by @xmath130 .",
    "that means , that @xmath131 and therefore the global scaling properties of the surface are governed by the subset of points , which has the greatest fractal dimension .",
    "consequently , the surface will behave like a self - affine surface with hurst exponent @xmath125 on lenghtscales comparable to the system size .",
    ".simulation results : @xmath132 is the fraction of particles which desorbes , @xmath113 is the scaling exponent of the pdf of surface heights , @xmath125 the hlder exponent which maximizes @xmath46 , @xmath1 and @xmath133 are the global scaling exponents of @xmath124 , @xmath134 is the fractal dimension of the surface . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table [ tabelle ] summarizes our results . model a without desorption reviews the results in @xcite , which have been obtained with slightly different activation energies on smaller systems and shorter timescales .",
    "models b and c show , that desorption is an important process , which , although it affects only a small fraction of the adsorbed particles , must not be neglected , since it alters the scaling properties of the surfaces by reducing @xmath113 and by shifting the singularity spectrum towards smaller hlder exponents .",
    "since the scaling behaviour depends strongly on the height of the energy barrier of desorption , and the singularity spectra have no measurable tendency to narrow with time , our results can not be used to make any decision on the aymptotic universality class of the investigated model",
    ". however , they show , that the paradigm of a few universality classes characterized by a _ small _ number of exponents , which are _ independent _ on details of the model , is _ not _ adequate to catch the features of kinetic roughening on experimentally relevant timescales of a few hours of growth ."
