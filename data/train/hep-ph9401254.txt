    "the @xmath0 decay has received considerable interest in the last years , thanks to its sensitivity to physics beyond the standard model .    on the experimental side , the limit for the inclusive decay based on the first observation of the @xmath2 transition by the cleo collaboration  @xcite ,",
    "are compatible with the sm predictions , taking into account leading qcd corrections .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "after the first computations of the decay amplitudes   and the confirmation of the results of  @xcite given by us in  @xcite , several improvements have occurred .    in  @xcite",
    "the analysis has been extended to include all the relevant operators that mix under qcd corrections and contribute to the leading logarithmic corrections .    in  @xcite",
    "the long - standing problem of the differences between the results obtained in  @xcite and in  @xcite has been solved , by showing that the anomalous dimension matrix is scheme dependent even at the leading order .",
    "this effect is compensated by the matrix elements of @xmath3 fermion operators , and the physical results are scheme independent .",
    "a similar analysis limited to a subset of the relevant operators is also presented in  @xcite .    in",
    "@xcite it has been performed an analysis of all the sources of uncertainty in the leading logarithmic order computation ( llo ) and it has been shown that the inclusion of the next to leading order corrections ( nlo ) can reduce the uncertainty from 25% to less than 10% .    in view of these considerations",
    "we think that it is time to undertake a nlo computation and in this paper we reconsider the llo computation with a technique that we think particularly apt to this purpose . as a byproduct , we confirm the recent results of ciuchini et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "dimensional methods differ in the treatment of the @xmath1 matrix : to our knowledge , the only method that does not exhibit any inconsistency is the thooft veltman scheme ( hv )  @xcite . unfortunately , this method is very cumbersome and in literature simplified versions have been used , like naive dimensional regularization ( ndr ) or dimensional reduction ( dred )  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown  ( @xcite and references therein ) that ndr , dred , hv methods give the same physical results in a large class of radiative - correction computations ( up to two loops ) where no trace ambiguities arise ; on the other hand it is well known that inherent pathologies of ndr and dred schemes are present at three - loops level  @xcite .",
    "we are therefore interested in a _",
    "practical _ approach to the evaluation of radiative corrections , as proposed in  @xcite , avoiding the extension of the @xmath1 matrix to @xmath4 .",
    "this method appears to be free of ambiguities , and in our opinion presents less complications than the hv scheme , especially when performing computations by symbolic manipulation programs .",
    "the plan of the letter is as follows : in section  ( [ sec : strategy ] ) we describe the scheme we have used , recalling the results in  @xcite , then in section  ( [ sec : bsgamma ] ) we show how we have applied the method to the @xmath0 process .",
    "we aim to evaluate the amplitude for a decay process induced by the exchange of virtual particles , such as the flavor changing neutral current processes .",
    "the integration of the heavy degrees of freedom ( in our case , @xmath5 boson and @xmath6 quark ) leaves an effective hamiltonian , whose matrix elements in the background of the `` light '' theory determine the decay amplitude at the lowest order in the heavy - mass expansion @xmath7 the coefficients of the operators in the effective hamiltonian are determined matching the two sides of  ( [ eq : lightandheavy ] ) in perturbation theory at a scale of the order of the heavy masses . at @xmath8",
    "all the qcd large logarithms originate in the operator matrix elements of the effective theory and the improved perturbation theory allows to resum them sistematically .",
    "the rg invariance of the l.h.s . of  ( [ eq : lightandheavy ] )",
    "is exploited , together with the calculable @xmath9 dependence of the matrix elements , to evolve down the r.h.s . at values of @xmath9 comparable with the scales of the external states",
    "; this amounts to `` transfer '' the large logarithms from the matrix elements to the coefficients .",
    "the key element is therefore the evaluation of the anomalous dimension matrix of the operators , which determines their @xmath9 evolution , together with the `` matching '' conditions at the @xmath10 scale and the matrix elements at the lower end of the evolution .",
    "this procedure is in general dependent on the regularization and renormalization scheme chosen for the operators .",
    "now what is important for our discussion is the freedom to define the @xmath11 dimensional extension of the operators of the effective hamiltonian : as in  @xcite we will use this freedom to simplify the computation .",
    "let us first observe that the general structure of the effective hamiltonian for the @xmath12 decay contains chiral projectors @xmath13 ; therefore a definition of the @xmath1 matrix is required in @xmath11 dimensions .",
    "we have @xmath14 where @xmath15 stand for the magnetic momentum operators , while @xmath16 are the current - current operators : the field content is immaterial at this level .",
    "consider on the other hand the effective hamiltonian obtained with an exchange @xmath17 @xmath18 where we intend that the operator @xmath19 is equal to @xmath15 apart the chiral projector , and analogously for the other operators .",
    "since qcd does not know the sign of @xmath1 , the two hamiltonians will receive the same perturbative corrections , that is @xmath20 & + & \\gamma^{ll\\,r}_{i\\,j } n[r_j ] + \\gamma^{ll\\,ll}_{i\\,j } n[\\left(l\\otimes l\\right)_j ] + \\gamma^{ll\\,lr}_{i\\,j } n[\\left(l\\otimes r\\right)_j ] = 0\\nonumber\\\\ { \\cal d } n[\\left(r\\otimes r\\right)^\\prime_i ] & + & \\gamma^{ll\\,r}_{i\\,j } n[l^\\prime_j ] + \\gamma^{ll\\,ll}_{i\\,j } n[\\left(r\\otimes r\\right)^\\prime_j ] + \\gamma^{ll\\,lr}_{i\\,j } n[\\left(r\\otimes l\\right)^\\prime_j ] = 0\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\dots , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] assuming the same renormalization scheme is used .",
    "the @xmath21 $ ] symbol stands for the operator @xmath22 renormalized by minimal subtraction .",
    "let us now take the linear combinations which are symmetric and anti - symmetric under the @xmath1 sign flip @xmath23 the original hamiltonian , which determines the physical amplitude , is a combination of the symmetric and anti - symmetric hamiltonian ; the key point is that in order to obtain the scaling properties of @xmath24 it is sufficient to know the qcd evolution of @xmath25 .",
    "in other words it is possible to choose the same renormalization scheme for @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and therefore determine , for instance , the evolution of an operator having chiral structure @xmath28 from the evolution of @xmath29 . in the case",
    "at hand we can choose a scheme for the symmetric part which is as simple as possible , and forget the anti - symmetric part .",
    "let us focus on the current - current operators ; the extension of the symmetrized hamiltonian @xmath26 to @xmath11 dimensions can be conveniently done reexpressing tensor products of @xmath30 matrices as elements of the clifford @xmath11 dimensional algebra , for instance @xmath31 \\equiv \\gamma_\\mu \\otimes \\gamma_\\mu + \\frac{1}{3 ! } \\gamma_{\\mu\\nu\\rho }   \\otimes \\gamma_{\\mu\\nu\\rho}\\ .",
    "\\label{eq : example}\\ ] ] more generally a complete basis in @xmath11 dimensions is provided by the operators @xmath32    this extension to @xmath11-dimensions does not require any definition of a @xmath11 dimensional @xmath1 and therefore it avoids the complications due to the splitting between @xmath33-dimensional space and @xmath3-dimensional space",
    ". it also allows to treat relevant operators having @xmath34 and evanescent operators having @xmath35 at the same way .",
    "many tecnical details will be explained in a more extended work  @xcite where a detailed account of the computation and the full set of formulas needed in addition to the ones in  @xcite to implement the method will be given as a reference for future works .",
    "let us write down the effective on - shell hamiltonian for the @xmath36 , already used in  @xcite , in euclidean notation : @xmath37 following the steps outlined in the preceding section , we consider the on - shell basis , in @xmath11 dimensions @xmath38 the symmetrized operators corresponding to the ones listed in  ( [ eq : misiak - ciuchinibasis ] ) are defined as @xmath39    the first step is to determine the anomalous dimension matrix of the operators listed in  ( [ eq : basisd ] ) , by using algebraic identities for arbitrary @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "the next step is to determine the renormalization group evolution in @xmath11 dimensional space : @xmath41 & + & \\sum_{j,\\,m } \\gamma_{\\left(i,\\,n\\right),\\,\\left(j,\\,m\\right ) } n\\left[{o_{\\left(j,\\,m\\right)}}\\right ] + \\sum_{k } \\gamma_{\\left(i,\\,n\\right),\\,k } n\\left[{o_{k}}\\right ] = 0 \\nonumber\\\\ { \\cal d } n\\left[{o_{n}}\\right ] & + & \\sum_{m}\\gamma_{n\\,m } n\\left[{o_{k}}\\right ] = 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 here and in the following @xmath43 are the casimir invariants of @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the number of active flavors .",
    "note that the basis in  ( [ eq : basisd ] ) is infinite , but the sums in  ( [ eq : rg ] ) run , at a definite order in the loop expansion , over a limited set of operators .",
    "for instance at one loop the sub - matrix @xmath30 of operators @xmath47 results as follows , omitting a factor @xmath48 @xmath49 that means that even if the basis contains only operators @xmath50 at the @xmath51 scale , the evanescent operators @xmath52 appear at one - loop order .",
    "the last step is to project the rg equations in @xmath3 dimensions .",
    "this is most easily done by using the reduction formulas  @xcite to reexpress the insertion of evanescent operators in green functions as a contribution to the coefficients of relevant operators @xmath53 = \\sum_{i } r_{i,\\,j } n\\left[{r_j}\\right]\\ , \\ ] ] where the @xmath54 matrix can be determined perturbatively .",
    "one is then able to decouple the evanescent operators at the level of the rg equation and this is equivalent , as one can easily check , to define a non - minimal subtraction scheme which sets to zero the matrix elements of evanescent operators , as in  @xcite .",
    "the anomalous dimension matrix for relevant operators is modified as follows ( schematically ) @xmath55 at leading logarithmic order , only the reduction over magnetic momentum operators is relevant , resulting in the following entries @xmath56 the reduction over four fermion operators is of order @xmath57 and it is relevant only for the nlo computation .",
    "we give the final results of the anomalous dimension matrix after the reduction to @xmath3 dimensions in the basis  ( [ eq : on - shellbasis ] ) , in a form suitable for comparison with ciuchini et al .",
    "@xcite : @xmath58 where @xmath59 are the scheme independent anomalous dimension matrices in the four - fermion and in the magnetic momentum sectors respectively , @xmath60 while @xmath61 is the scheme dependent matrix connecting dimension @xmath62 and dimension @xmath63 operators @xmath64 obtained from the computation of the graphs in fig .",
    "( 1 ) for different insertions of @xmath3 fermion operators .    [",
    "fig : fig1 ]    following the authors of  @xcite we define @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the number of active up and down flavors .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , the matrix @xmath61 is scheme dependent , and in order to give a sensible result we have to compute the matrix elements of operators @xmath67 : @xmath68 we have checked that the physical result is indeed scheme independent .",
    "the easiest way to show this in our context is to perform a finite renormalization @xmath69 = \\left(\\hat{f}\\right)_{i\\,j } n\\left[{q^s_j}\\right]\\ ] ] which sets to zero the matrix elements in  ( [ eq : matel ] ) .",
    "note that this finite subtraction is independent on the coupling @xmath57 , a consequence of the fact that the scheme dependence stems from penguin diagrams at zeroth order in qcd  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the adm matrix is modified as follows @xmath70 using the results in  ( [ eq : matel ] ) to define the matrix @xmath71 , the scheme dependent sub - matrix becomes : @xmath72 which as expected coincides with the result in the hv scheme  @xcite , where the matrix elements in  ( [ eq : matel ] ) are zero .",
    "we have confirmed the results of ciuchini et al .",
    "@xcite by using a method which appears well suited for the nlo order computation .",
    "we stress that our considerations are of practical nature : in the evaluation of qcd corrections to electroweak processes this technique appears less involved than the thooft - veltman scheme , without introducing any potential ambiguity in the regularization .",
    "moreover this method presents other advantages , which will be elucidated in an extended description of the computation  @xcite : we just mention here that , thanks to generalized fierz identities  @xcite , graphs like the ones in fig .",
    "( 2 ) are related and the knowledge of the `` bare '' graph with an open loop ( on the left side of fig .",
    "( 2 ) ) for arbitrary values of @xmath40 allows to determine directly the value of the traced graph .",
    "this and similar considerations will be very useful in the nlo computation , certainly a formidable task , but in our opinion worthwhile in order to test as stringently as possible the standard model predictions .",
