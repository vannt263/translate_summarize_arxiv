    "a future detection of gravitational waves ( gws ) will not only test the theory of general relativity , but will also provide a precious new tool in astronomy ( hughes et al .",
    "2001 , and references therein ) .",
    "this tool will be particularly effective for studying compact objects because the information carried by gws is very different from that of electromagnetic radiation .",
    "gravitational radiation is generated by different physical processes and is often emitted from dense regions that are otherwise _ hidden _ from traditional astronomical observations .",
    "a very important distinction , particularly for the study of the distant universe is that while the usual observable for electromagnetic radiation is an energy flux which drops in proportion to distance squared , the direct observable for gravitational radiation is the wave amplitude @xmath5 which drops off only as distance . as a result",
    ", the coalescence of many massive black - hole ( bh ) binaries ( @xmath6 ) will be detectable by the planned gw observatory lisa ( laser interferometry space antenna ) at mhz frequencies out to very high redshifts ( haehnelt  1994 ; hughes et al .",
    "2001 ) . at the lower @xmath7hz frequencies ,",
    "pulsar timing measurements limit the level of the cosmic gw background , contributed mainly by the early phase in the coalescence of massive bh binaries ( kaspi et al .  1994 ; thorsett & dewey  1996 ; lommen  2002 ) .",
    "massive bh binaries are among the primary sources for lisa .",
    "such binaries are produced by mergers of galaxies with pre - existing black holes , provided that coalescence due to the interaction of the binary with its surrounding galaxy occurs in less than a hubble time .",
    "hughes  ( 2002 ) has shown that lisa observations of the gravitational radiation during both the inspiral and ring - down phases of massive bh binary coalescence can be used to determine the source redshift , while the source position on the sky can be inferred within a fraction of an orbit of the lisa satellite .",
    "recently , seto  ( 2002 ) has noted that consideration of the finite length of the lisa detector leads to significant improvements in estimations of the accuracy to which the three - dimensional positions for coalescing bh binaries can be measured .",
    "black holes are ubiquitous in low redshift galaxies ( e.g. magorrian et al .",
    "their masses , @xmath3 , as determined from dynamical measurements ( e.g. merritt & ferrarese  2001 ; tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ) or from reverberation mapping of agn ( e.g. ferrarese et al .  2001 ; laor  2001 ) , correlate tightly with the velocity dispersion , @xmath8 , of their host stellar bulge .",
    "however , the abundance of massive bhs in galaxies at high redshifts is not well known .",
    "in fact , menou , haiman & narayanan  ( 2001 ) have argued that an occupation fraction as low as 0.01 at redshift 5 can result through subsequent mergers , in all local massive galaxies containing massive bhs .",
    "nevertheless , one might expect massive bhs to be ubiquitous at high redshifts for the following reason .",
    "it is commonly thought that present day bhs are the dormant remnants of the active galactic nuclei observed at high redshift .",
    "recent observations of this population have reached out beyond redshift 6 ( fan et al .",
    "the quasars discovered are very bright , and must be powered by bh masses of @xmath9m@xmath10 .",
    "recent modeling by wyithe & loeb  ( 2002 ) has shown that the density of these high - redshift quasars as well as lower redshift populations can be explained through merger activity using the same relation between host velocity dispersion and bh mass as observed locally . the latter assumption is supported by the recent observation that the relation between velocity dispersion and bh mass holds in quasars out to redshift 3 ( shields et al .",
    "this result suggests that if bhs are not ubiquitous in galaxies at high redshift , then it must be a coincidence that the active quasar period increases at high redshift in inverse proportion to the occupation fraction .",
    "note also that the inferred active period for a bh at @xmath11 is @xmath12yr or @xmath13 of a hubble time ( wyithe & loeb  2002 ) .",
    "thus the minimum occupation fraction at @xmath11 is @xmath14 .",
    "the emission of gws requires that the binary coalesce in less than a hubble time .",
    "what is the mechanism that brings a wide binary system with an orbital separation @xmath15 kpc into the regime where coalescence is dominated by gravitational radiation ?",
    "several mechanisms have been discussed in the literature , including dynamical friction on the background stars ( e.g. begelman , blandford , & rees 1980 ; rajagopal & romani  1995 ; milosavljevic & merritt  2001 ; yu  2002 ) , and a gas dynamical effect analogous to that thought responsible for planetary migration ( gould & rix  2000 ; armitage & natarajan 2002 ) .",
    "yu  ( 2002 ) has followed the expected evolution of massive central bh binaries in a sample of nearby early - type galaxies for which high - resolution photometry exists , and found that the evolution timescale increases significantly when the bh binary becomes hard before entering the gw regime .",
    "spherical galaxies often lead to coalescence timescales that are longer than a hubble time , while highly flattened or triaxial galaxies lead to faster coalescence .",
    "regardless of the physical mechanism , haehnelt & kauffmann  ( 2002 ) argue that if central binaries do not merge in less than a hubble time , then three - body interactions resulting from subsequent mergers will cause ejection and too much scatter in the @xmath16 relation .",
    "hereafter , we assign an efficiency @xmath17 to the coalescence process . throughout this paper",
    "we show numerical results under the assumption that bh binaries formed through the merger of two galaxies proceed quickly to coalescence ( @xmath18 ) , but point out the relevant scaling with @xmath17 where appropriate .",
    "the number of binary sources depends on a convolution over redshift of the merger rate of galaxies with the fraction of galaxies that harbor massive bhs .",
    "several attempts have been made to compute the event rate ( fukushige , ebisuzaki & makino  1992 ; haehnelt  1994 ; rajagopal & romani  1995 ; haehnelt  1998 ; menou , haiman & narayanan  2002 ; jaffe & backer  2002 ) , either based on observational counts of quasars and elliptical galaxies with arbitrary extrapolations to higher redshift , or using merger tree algorithms based the press - schechter theory . despite the fact that detectors such as lisa are expected to detect events at exceedingly high redshift , many calculations have only considered low ( @xmath19 ) redshift sources .",
    "however , recent evidence of bright quasar activity at @xmath20 ( fan et al .",
    "2001 ) and independent evidence that these quasars reside in massive dark - matter halos ( barkana & loeb  2002 ) , suggests that bhs might be as ubiquitous at the centers of high - redshift galaxies as they are today .",
    "furthermore , prior to reionization the ability of gas to cool inside small halos is mainly limited by the efficiency of gas cooling rather than by the infall of gas from a heated and photoionized intergalactic medium , and so massive bhs could form inside much smaller galaxies than are available after reionization ( e.g. barkana & loeb 2000 ; haiman , abel & rees  2001 ; thoul & weinberg  1996 ) . as a result it is possible that a substantial fraction of the events detectable by lisa have originated prior to reionization .",
    "our paper explores this possibility .",
    "recently , jaffe & backer  ( 2002 ) have computed the spectrum of characteristic strain resulting from massive bh mergers in the @xmath21hz-@xmath7hz regime using a phenomenological approach for the merger rate and bh mass function up to some maximum redshift .",
    "they found that the logarithmic spectral slope of the stochastic cosmic background of gravitational radiation that results from inspiraling bhs is -2/3 , independent of the details of their model for the merger rate and bh mass function .",
    "this provides a numerical confirmation of the general result derived by phinney  ( 2001 ) .",
    "they also found that the amplitude of the spectrum is close to the limit probed by recent pulsar timing experiments , but is sensitive to the model assumed for the bh mass function and merger rate . in this paper",
    "we make a full semi - analytic calculation of the entire merger rate history starting from the highest redshifts when the first galaxies are believed to have formed in the universe ( barkana & loeb  2001 , and references therein ) .",
    "we employ the formalisms of press & schechter  ( 1974 ) and lacey & cole  ( 1993 ) , and compute the resulting redshift - dependent bh mass function ( including the effect of reionization ) using the observed relation between bh mass and halo circular velocity .",
    "we compare our results with current limits on the cosmic gw background at low frequencies , and extend the calculation upwards in frequency to the lisa band .    throughout the paper",
    "we assume density parameter values of @xmath22 in matter , @xmath23 in baryons , @xmath24 in a cosmological constant , and a hubble constant of @xmath25 ( or equivalently @xmath26 ) . for calculations of the press - schechter  ( 1974 ) mass function ( with the modification of sheth & tormen  1999 ) we assume a primordial power - spectrum with a power - law index @xmath27 and the fitting formula to the exact transfer function of cold dark matter , given by bardeen et al .",
    "( 1986 ) . unless otherwise noted we adopt a present - day rms amplitude of @xmath28 for mass density fluctuations in a sphere of radius @xmath29mpc .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in   [ bhev ] we describe calculation of the evolution of the bh mass - function following reionization . in   [ mrate ] , ",
    "[ edur ] and   [ spec ] we use the results of this calculation to predict the merger rate and hence the detection rate of gw sources by lisa , the distribution of event durations , and the resulting spectrum of the characteristic strain .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in   [ conc ] .",
    "during hierarchal galaxy formation , an average property of the galaxy population , such as the density of galaxies evolves in redshift due to newly collapsing halos , mergers of halos and accretion . in this section",
    "we discuss the calculation of the rate of newly collapsing halos , and then demonstrate a method to calculate the continuous evolution of the massive bh mass function .",
    "let @xmath30 be the press - schechter mass function ( number of halos with mass between @xmath31 and @xmath32 per co - moving mpc ) of dark - matter halos at a redshift @xmath33 .",
    "we include the extension of sheth & tormen  ( 1999 ) which improves the agreement with direct numerical simulations ( jenkins et al .",
    "the rate of change ( with respect to redshift ) of the density of dark matter halos with masses between @xmath34 and @xmath35 is therefore @xmath36 .",
    "let us also define @xmath37 , the number of mergers per unit time of halos of mass @xmath38 with halos of mass @xmath31 ( forming new halos of mass @xmath39 ) at redshift @xmath33 ( lacey & cole  1993 ) .",
    "we consider mergers of halos having masses greater than @xmath40 .",
    "addition of mass from halos smaller than @xmath41 is treated as smooth accretion . in what follows this contribution to the growth of halos",
    "must be included to maintain a self - consistent calculation .",
    "we therefore find the component of the change in the density of halos with masses between @xmath34 and @xmath35 that is due to accretion rather than to mergers .",
    "this is given by the overall change in the density of halos with mass @xmath34 , minus the change due to merger of halos to form a new halo of mass @xmath34 , plus the change in density of halos of mass @xmath34 that merge with other halos ( a change that was compensated for in the net @xmath42 ) .",
    "the net change in density of halos of mass @xmath34 through accretion is then , @xmath43    we are interested in the evolution of the mass function of dark - matter halos that contain a massive bh . prior to reionization , the minimum mass halo inside of which gas can cool is limited by the cooling rate , and corresponds to a virial temperature above @xmath44k if the gas cools through transitions in atomic hydrogen , or above @xmath45k if the gas cools through transitions in molecular hydrogen ( haiman , abel & rees  2000 ) . following reionization , the igm is heated to @xmath46k .",
    "the jeans mass is increased by several orders of magnitude , and numerical simulations find that gas infall is suppressed in larger halos .",
    "there is some uncertainty about the precise value of the halo circular velocity below which gas infall is suppressed ( e.g. thoul & weinberg  1996 ; kitayama & ikeuchi  2000 ; quinn , katz & efstathiou  1996 , weinberg , hernquist & katz  1997 ; navarro & steinmetz  1997 ) .",
    "we assume that following reionization , gas can cool inside newly collapsing halos if their virial temperatures are higher than @xmath47k .",
    "we denote by @xmath48 the fraction of halos which contain a massive bh after crossing the cooling threshhold through accretion .",
    "halos forming via mergers are assumed to contain a massive bh if one of the subunits used to make them already contained a bh .",
    "in addition , if the merger product has a mass larger than @xmath49 , then a bh could form out of the gas that cools inside the merger product .",
    "we assume that this happens in a fraction @xmath50 of cases where neither the initial nor the accreted halo contained a bh",
    ". the mass function of halos containing a massive bh ( @xmath51 ) therefore evolves according to the following differential equation : @xmath52\\\\ \\nonumber & + & \\int_{m_{\\rm min}}^{\\frac{m_1}{2}}d\\delta m\\left.\\frac{d^2n_{\\rm mrg}}{d\\delta mdt}\\right|_{m_1-\\delta m}\\frac{dt}{dz}\\frac{dn_{\\rm bh}}{d(m_1-\\delta m)}\\theta[m(t_{\\rm min})-m_1]\\\\ \\nonumber & + & \\int_{m_{\\rm min}}^{\\frac{m_1}{2}}d\\delta m\\left.\\frac{d^2n_{\\rm mrg}}{d\\delta mdt}\\right|_{m_1-\\delta m}\\frac{dt}{dz}\\left\\{\\left[1-\\left(1-\\frac{dn_{\\rm",

    "the first term gives the change in the density of halos containing bhs due to newly collapsing halos above the threshold virial temperature .",
    "the second and third terms give the increase due to mergers of the density of halos of mass @xmath34 that contain a bh .",
    "the second term gives the increase for halos below the threshold temperature due to mergers with a halo already containing a bh .",
    "this term will be important since the mass corresponding to the minimum temperature increases with time , and because reionization results in an increase of the minimum mass halo inside which gas can collapse and cool .",
    "the third term gives the increase in the density of halos with virial temperatures above the threshold temperature that contain bhs .",
    "there are two parts to this term .",
    "if the halo of mass @xmath56 contains a black hole , then so does the merger product .",
    "however if the halo of mass @xmath56 does not contain a bh then the merger product only contains a bh if one of the following two conditions hold : either the accreted halo ( of mass @xmath38 ) already contained a bh , or if it did not then a bh forms in a fraction @xmath50 of merger products .",
    "finally , the fourth term allows for the loss in the density of halos of mass @xmath34 that contain black holes due to mergers forming a larger halo .",
    "there are two limiting cases ; @xmath54 in which case all galaxies with masses above the cooling threshhold contain black - holes , and @xmath57 in which case the number of massive bhs drops with time through galaxy mergers .",
    "below we discuss these cases in more detail .",
    "we consider 4 examples for the evolution of @xmath58 . these will be referred to throughout the paper and",

    "cases i , ii and iv refer to situations where cooling in neutral gas is limited by atomic hydrogen , and in which bh formation is ongoing .",
    "case iii refers to situations where cooling in neutral gas is limited by molecular hydrogen , and in which the bh population arises from `` seed bhs '' at @xmath61 .",
    "we show the four examples of evolution of @xmath51 in figure  [ fig1 ] . here",
    "the density of halos of mass @xmath31 that contain a bh is plotted as a function of redshift ( solid lines ) .",
    "the dashed lines show the corresponding press - schechter mass function , and each pair of curves is labeled by the logarithm of the mass in @xmath70 on the left of the plot .",
    "the thick dashed line is the density of halos with the minimum virial temperature into which gas can collapse , and has a discontinuity at @xmath71 . in cases i and ii we see that following reionization , the density of halos below the critical virial temperature that contain bhs drops as these halos merge to form more massive halos . by redshift 2 ( @xmath64 ) and 5 ( @xmath72 ) , there are no halos containing bhs left with temperatures below @xmath73 .",
    "the calculation of the bh mass function from the mass - function of halos that contain bhs requires specification of a relation between the bh and halo mass .",
    "ferrarese  ( 2002 ) has found a tight , power - law correlation in nearby galaxies between the mass of a dark - matter halo and the mass of its central bh .",
    "following haehnelt , natarajan & rees  ( 1998 ) and wyithe & loeb  ( 2002 ) we generalise to higher redshifts assuming a bh mass that scales as a powerlaw with circular velocity @xmath74 . using the expression for halo mass @xmath31 as a function of @xmath75 ( barkana & loeb  2001 ) we find @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 $ ] . in this notation",

    "refer to bh masses , while those without refer to halo masses .",
    "the merger rates are computed in terms of halo masses , but many expressions implicitly contain conversion from bh to halo mass or vice versa using equation  ( [ bh ] ) .",
    "simple considerations of the regulation of bh growth by feedback from quasar activity result in @xmath83 ( haehnelt , natarajan & rees  1998 ; silk & rees 1998 ) . supporting this argument",
    "is the recent finding of shields et al .",
    "( 2002 ) that the @xmath16 relation derived from qsos shows no redshift dependence .",
    "the growth of bhs only through hierarchical mergers imply @xmath84 .",
    "a value of @xmath85 is therefore required in order to allow bh growth through accretion that must accompany quasar activity . with @xmath83 ,",
    "theoretical luminosity functions require @xmath86 ( wyithe & loeb  2002 ) , and these are the values used throughout this work unless specified otherwise .",
    "the mass function of bhs is therefore @xmath87    the evolution of @xmath88 is shown in each of cases i - iv in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the mass - function of halos that contain bhs @xmath89 is insensitive to the bh  halo mass relation .",
    "however , in the examples shown , bhs exist in halos as small as @xmath90 .",
    "extrapolation of the @xmath91 relation down to these small galaxies is not justified by observations ; moreover , it yields bh masses comparable to those expected from stars where the formation physics is very different .",
    "we therefore only show the mass function down to @xmath92 .",
    "we will show that the low frequency gw signal is dominated by bhs in galaxies with @xmath93 ; however bhs in smaller galaxies are important as seeds for massive bhs in larger galaxies at later times .",
    "the bh mass functions can be compared with those presented in figure  5 of kauffmann & haehnelt  ( 2000 ) .",
    "the density of the most massive bhs increases monotonically with time , while in cases i , ii and iv there is little evolution in the density of lower mass bhs before reionization .",
    "however following reionization , there is rapid evolution at low masses since newly formed low - mass halos do not produce bhs , and the density of low mass halos that contain bhs drops as they merge to form larger halos .",
    "case iii shows a different evolution ; since there is no ongoing bh formation the reionization redshift does not leave any signature .",
    "case iv with a smaller value of @xmath69 yields lower bh densities at all redshifts .",
    "as described earlier , we assume that in a fraction @xmath17 of galaxy mergers the resulting binary bhs evolve rapidly into the regime where energy loss is dominated by gravitational radiation . defining this time as @xmath94 , the subsequent evolution of the binary is then described by equation  ( [ frequency ] ) .",
    "it can be shown ( e.g. shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) that the evolution in the binaries ( circular ) orbital frequency @xmath95 with time @xmath96 obeys the relation @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the orbital frequency at time @xmath99 . throughout the paper",
    "we assume circular orbits for which the observed gravitational radiation has a characteristic frequency @xmath100 and characteristic strain , averaged over orientations and polarizations ( thorne  1987 ) of @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the co - moving coordinate distance to redshift @xmath33 .",
    "the choice of @xmath102 as the distance measure ensures that the energy flux , which is proportional to @xmath103 , declines in proportion to the inverse square of the luminosity distance . as a binary loses energy , the frequency as well as amplitude of the gravitational radiation increase with time .",
    "following hughes  ( 2002 ) we assume that the inspiral attains its maximum frequency when the two bhs are separated by 3 schwarzschild radii , i.e. @xmath104hz for a schwarzschild bh , and stop our calculation at this point .",
    "hughes & blandford  ( 2002 ) find that following a major merger , the remnant is rarely rotating rapidly unless the mass ratio is @xmath105 . in this work",
    "we neglect the subsequent higher frequency radiation from the coalescence and ringdown phases .",
    "the proposed gw observatory lisa will be able to detect many mergers of massive bhs out to very high redshifts ( haehnelt  1994 ; hughes et al .",
    "it is therefore interesting to calculate the number of detectable mergers expected per unit redshift per unit ( observed ) time on the sky .",
    "previous attempts at this calculation have used empirical local rates and extrapolation ( e.g. backer & jaffe  2002 ) , or have used a merger tree algorithm .",
    "menou , haiman & narayanan  ( 2001 ) used a merger tree algorithm to predict the merger rate out to @xmath106 , beyond which they found that the press - schechter mass function was no longer accurately recovered .",
    "we have circumvented this problem by integrating the bh mass function forward in time , while exactly preserving the press - schechter mass function .",
    "this allows us to explore the merger rate at higher redshifts and identify the possible signature of reionization in gw observations .",
    "the number of detectable bh mergers per observed year per unit redshift across the entire sky is @xmath107\\frac{\\epsilon_{\\rm mrg}}{1+z}4\\pi\\frac{d^2v}{dzd\\omega},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath108 is the co - moving volume and @xmath109 is solid angle on the sky .",
    "note that there must be bhs present in both galaxies in order for gravitational radiation to be produced ( this being the origin of the term in square brackets ) .",
    "the function @xmath110 has a value of 1 if the merger produces a detectable strain in the lisa band , but is zero otherwise .",
    "in our calculations throughout this paper we set @xmath18 .",
    "since @xmath17 is our parameterization of the efficiency with which dynamical friction brings binary bhs into the gw regime , this corresponds to the assumption that all bh binaries coalesce",
    ". however , more generally , @xmath111 .    at a frequency of @xmath112hz , the expected value of the threshhold sensitivity is @xmath113 for a signal to noise ratio of 5 ( needed for confident detection of a binary with unknown frequency and direction ) and one year of observation .",
    "we find that the typical event duration at frequencies between @xmath114hz and @xmath115hz ranges between a few months to a year .",
    "we therefore assume detectability if the strain amplitude @xmath116 at an observed frequency of @xmath117hz .",
    "note that a full calculation of the signal to noise ratio of an observation requires comparison of the coherently folded signal power ( including the evolution in its frequency ) to the noise power accumulated over the bandwidth of the measurement . by working with the quantity @xmath118 ( thorne  1987 )",
    ", we approximately account for the detection threshold .",
    "the function @xmath119 is included in equation  ( [ mergerrate ] ) because the merger of dark matter halos does not imply the immediate merger of the stellar systems within .",
    "colpi , mayer & governato  ( 1999 ) have studied the evolution of satellites in virialized halos .",

    "note that even though @xmath122 for the initial orbit of the secondary galaxy in the dark matter halo , eventually the eccentricity decays rapidly during the gw driven inspiral of the binary bh system ( e.g. peters  1964 ; hughes & blandford  2002 ; yu  2002 ) .",
    "the dynamical time may be written from the expressions in barkana & loeb  ( 2001 ) as @xmath123^{-1/2}h^{-1}(1+z)^{-3/2}\\ ] ] and amounts to about a tenth of the hubble time . in order to have the satellite sink in less than a hubble time",
    ", the merging galaxies must be of comparable mass .",
    "the dynamical evolution of a massive binary bh may be disrupted if there is a subsequent major merger before coalescence of the initial binary .",
    "this typically leads to the ejection of the lightest of the three black - holes ( e.g. haehnelt & kauffmann  2002 ; volonteri , haardt & madau  2002 ) . to account for this phenomenon in a simple way",
    ", we assume that at most one coalescence can occur during the decay time @xmath124 or within a hubble time , whichever is the larger . in mergers where the satellite does not sink within a hubble time , we assume no coalescence . furthermore ,",
    "following kauffmann & haehnelt  ( 2000 ) we suppress gas accretion and therefore bh mergers within galaxies with @xmath125km / sec , though this restriction does not significantly affect our results .",

    "as is evident from the plot , the source counts may probe the reionization epoch out to large redshifts .",

    "this drop arises because even though some halos below the critical temperature still contain bhs until @xmath136 ( @xmath64 ) and @xmath106 ( @xmath65 ) respectively , the event rate scales as the square of the bh occupation fraction .",
    "similar behavior is seen in case iv , however the smaller value of @xmath69 suppresses the growth of structure at early times relative to our fiducial case of @xmath28 .",
    "the resulting counts are much lower than in cases i - iii , @xmath137yr@xmath134 .",
    "the drop following reionization is much larger if the suppression of gas infall extends to larger galaxies .",
    "for example , if @xmath138k following reionization , the suppression of the number counts is more than an order of magnitude within 2 redshift units .",
    "similar results are found with @xmath139 ( @xmath140yr@xmath134 and @xmath141yr@xmath134 for cases i and ii ) .",
    "since mergers quickly result in massive bhs being ubiquitous in larger galaxies even if the occupation fraction is initially small ( menou , haiman & narayanan  2001 ) , the number counts and the corresponding spectra ( see subsequent sections ) are weakly dependent on @xmath142 , @xmath48 and @xmath50 .",
    "we therefore only consider @xmath63 for cases i , ii and iv in the remainder of this paper .",
    "in the previous section we calculated the event rate of detectable gravitational radiation sources for the lisa satellite .",
    "however we would also like to know how long these events will last .",
    "to this end we calculate the distribution of event durations @xmath143 for sources having observed strains between @xmath144 and @xmath145 at @xmath112hz .",
    "we define the event duration @xmath143 as the time taken for the frequency to pass through a single decade in frequency from @xmath146hz to @xmath115hz .    to calculate the event duration distribution",

    "even larger amplitude events from inspirals will be very rare . in case iv we find that the lower event rate means that only a few distinct events are expected per year at strains of @xmath174 of more .",
    "another prominent feature of case iv is the broadness of the curve for @xmath175 , being dominated by sources producing the peak in number counts near @xmath176 ( see figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "lisa will be sensitive to the final in - spirals and/or ringdown phases of most massive bh mergers ( haehnelt  1994 ; hughes et al .",
    ". however , with the exception of the occupation fraction , the event rate does not directly carry information on properties of the bh population itself such as the slope and normalization of the bh mass - function .",
    "individual events will yield useful information ( hughes  2002 ) , but we might also expect the number counts of sources in frequency and strain ( i.e. the time averaged number of sources per unit frequency per unit strain at a single epoch ) to provide constraints on the relation between bh and halo mass .    in analogy with the previous section we can use the merger rate and the mass function of halos containing massive bhs together with the bh - halo mass relation to find the instantaneous , time averaged number counts that should be observed in a snapshot of the sky per unit frequency per unit strain per co - moving mpc , @xmath177\\delta\\left[f(m_{\\rm bh},\\delta m_{\\rm bh},t - t_{\\rm start})\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where from equation  ( [ frequency ] ) @xmath178^{-3/8}.\\ ] ]",

    "for calculation of equation  ( [ lf ] ) we note that within the gw dominated regime there are some frequencies and mass combinations for which coalescence does not occur within a hubble time .",
    "we therefore assume that a bh binary produced through a galaxy merger will only result in the emission of gravitational radiation at a frequency @xmath180 if the binary coalescence as well as the prior sinking of the satellite occur before the next comparable merger event and within a hubble time .",

    "as expected , the number counts increase toward low frequencies since the inspiral lifetime scales as @xmath197 .",
    "however at all frequencies the number counts are cut off at both high and low amplitudes .",
    "the reasons are as follows .",
    "first , the cutoff at large @xmath144 is caused by the fact that the largest amplitude waves are produced at the final phase of the inspirals . since the inspiral has a maximum frequency ( hughes  2002 ) , reached when the binary separation becomes comparable to the schwarzschild radius , each binary also has a corresponding maximum amplitude .",
    "this effect plays a significant role in the characteristic strain spectrum in the frequency range applicable to lisa , a point to which we will return in the following section ,   [ strainspec ] .",
    "second , the cutoff at low amplitude is caused by the fact that at a fixed frequency , @xmath198 . since both @xmath3 and @xmath199 have a minimum value @xmath200 , the strain must be larger than a value proportional to @xmath201 .      the _ characteristic strain spectrum _ , @xmath202",
    "$ ] ( e.g. phinney  2001 ; jaffe & backer  2002 ) , describes the spatial spectrum of the stochastic background of gravitational radiation .",
    "the characteristic strain spectrum is related to the strain power - spectrum @xmath203 through @xmath204 where @xmath205 is calculated from @xmath206 the contribution to the characteristic strain spectrum from sources in a redshift interval can be calculated by integrating between the desired limits .",
    "we have plotted @xmath207 in figure  [ fig5 ] for cases i - iv . the thin lines from bottom to top show @xmath208 in the redshift intervals @xmath209 , @xmath210 , and @xmath211 .",
    "the solid thick lines show the total @xmath212 .",
    "the characteristic strain spectrum is dominated by sources having @xmath211 .",
    "the thick dashed line shows the spectrum deduced by jaffe & backer  ( 2002 ) .",
    "they found @xmath213 for the region accessible to pulsar timing experiments .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows their result at nhz frequencies and extrapolates it to the higher frequencies probed by lisa for comparison .    at frequencies between @xmath214hz and @xmath215hz ,",
    "the characteristic strain spectrum has a logarithmic slope of -2/3 .",
    "this slope results from the dependence of energy loss on frequency as explained by phinney  ( 2001 ) . at the higher frequencies relevant for lisa , we find departures from the -2/3 slope .",
    "the steepening of @xmath212 is due to the loss of power at high frequencies associated with the maximum frequency during inspiral . at frequencies below @xmath214hz",
    "there is loss of power arising because many very low frequency sources do not coalesce within a hubble time .",
    "the thick grey lines in the lower right corner of each panel in figure  [ fig5 ] show the instrumental noise equivalent of @xmath216 computed from the instrumental noise spectral amplitude @xmath217 .",
    "the curves are from a fit ( hughes 2002 ) to calculations of @xmath218 ( folkner 1998 ) .",
    "the amplitude of the characteristic strain spectrum should be detectable by lisa over the frequency range @xmath219@xmath220hz .",
    "however the low numbers of events will make the power - spectrum noisy in this regime . in general",
    "the binaries can be resolved provided less than 20% of the frequency bins are filled at any one time . as we showed in ",
    "[ edur ] , most events are of sufficiently short duration to allow each to be resolved separately . the white - dwarf / white - dwarf binary foreground",
    "was estimated by phinney  ( 2001 ) and is plotted as the thick dotted lines [ cut off below @xmath221hz since low frequency binaries are not expected to contribute significant gravitational waves ( hils , bender , & webbink 1991 ) . through most of the lisa band , this foreground is more than an order of magnitude below the expected background due to coalescing massive bh binaries .",
    "we also show in figure  [ fig5 ] the current upper limits on the gw background ( large dots ) .",
    "the most recent limits are quoted by lommen  ( 2002 ) .",
    "they find a limit on the fractional energy density in gravitational waves per logarithm of frequency at @xmath222hz is @xmath223 .",
    "we then find a corresponding limit , @xmath224 and @xmath225 on the characteristic strain spectrum of @xmath226hz@xmath227 .",
    "the limits are close to the theoretical spectrum in cases i - iii .",
    "we will return to this important and unexpected result below .",
    "our results in cases i ",
    "iii for the amplitude of the characteristic strain spectrum are different from the findings of jaffe & backer  ( 2002 ) in the regime accessible to pulsar timing .",
    "in particular we find that the models predict @xmath228hz@xmath229 that is an order of magnitude higher than predicted by jaffe & backer  ( 2002 ) , and which is close to the limits of detection by the pulsar timing measurements .",
    "there are several possible causes for this difference .",
    "jaffe & backer  ( 2002 ) use a power - law extrapolation of an estimate of the spheroid merger rate to higher redshifts , while in fact galaxies were made of smaller sub - units that had a higher merger probability at earlier cosmic times .",
    "also , they use a phenomenological prescription for the merger rate that may substantially underestimate the actual merger rate for short duty cycle events .",
    "furthermore , they assume the same merger rate for all galaxies , and do not assign a relation between black - hole and galaxy mass .",
    "in essence , we have assumed bhs to be associated with dark - matter halos , for which the merger history is understood rather than use an estimate of the average spheroid merger rate .",
    "the two assumptions lead to different results because the total merger rate of galaxies above the cooling threshhold as computed from the press - schechter formalism is higher than estimates of the observed spheroid merger rate .",
    "we find that if we artificially force equality between the merger rates computed in our work and those used in jaffe & backer  ( 2002 ) , we obtain a similar spectrum well below current limits .",
    "the results should also be dependent on the bh  halo mass relation .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath230 is proportional to @xmath231 [ see equation  ( [ strain ] ) , ( [ hspec ] ) and ( [ hspec2 ] ) ] . as a result",
    ", a lower value of @xmath232 will result in @xmath216 having a lower amplitude .",
    "moreover , the production of power at very low frequencies is dominated by very large bhs , and so @xmath216 should be sensitive to @xmath224 , with larger @xmath224 values resulting in larger amplitudes .",
    "we note that the log - normal distribution employed by jaffe & backer  ( 2002 ) is steeper at the highest masses than our bh mass function computed from the press - schechter mass function and the @xmath233 relation , which might further contribute to our differing results .",
    "we will return to the dependence on the bh  halo mass relation in the following section (   [ msiglim ] ) .",
    "our simulation of case iv yields a value of @xmath234hz@xmath229 that is an order of magnitude below current limits , and which is more consistent with the findings of jaffe & backer  ( 2002 ) .",
    "thus , the power in gws is quite sensitive to the value of @xmath235 .",
    "indeed @xmath230 is significantly more sensitive to @xmath235 than to the details of the merger history provided that the history results in bhs being ubiquitous in massive galaxies in the local universe .",
    "we find that the characteristic strain spectrum at low frequencies is dominated by galaxies having masses larger than @xmath236 merging at redshifts below the peak in quasar activity ( @xmath237 ) .",
    "this is particularly true of case iv .",
    "theoretical studies of the quasar luminosity function find that the lack of cold gas at low redshifts explains the drop in quasar activity in massive galaxies and @xmath224 used in this work are taken from results of the theoretical quasar luminosity function described in wyithe & loeb  ( 2002 ) which over - predicts the number of bright quasars at low redshift",
    ". however this approach does not over - predict the gw back - ground by predicting the existence of to many very massive bhs because similar values of @xmath232 and @xmath224 have been measured by ferrarese  ( 2000 ) in nearby galaxies . ]",
    "( kauffmann & haehnelt  2000 ) .",
    "if as suggested ( e.g. gould & rix  2000 ) gas that is driven to the center of the galaxy during a merger is the mechanism that brings the bh binary into the gw dominated regime , then we might expect galaxy mergers to be inefficient ( @xmath238 ) at producing gravitational radiation at low redshifts .",
    "if @xmath239 , then we expect the amplitude of @xmath230 which is proportional to @xmath240 , to be lower than predicted .",
    "our results from cases i - iii imply that limits on the efficiency can already be placed for some values of @xmath224 and @xmath232 using limits on @xmath230 from pulsar timing experiments (   [ msiglim ] ) .",
    "if @xmath17 is found to have a value of order unity through the detection of the background by future pulsar timing experiments or by the lisa satellite , then this would strengthen the case for similar values at yet higher redshifts .",
    "the number counts of mergers detected by lisa will therefore directly determine the bh occupation fraction at high redshift .",
    "the models considered in this paper predict characteristic strain spectra with values at @xmath222hz that are close to the current limits from pulsar timing experiments ( kaspi et al .",
    "1994 ; thorsett & dewey  1996 and lommen  2002 ) .",
    "so far we have concentrated on the spectrum and event rate for @xmath86 and @xmath83 , which are the values favored by simple feedback arguments and the theoretical model for the quasar luminosity function described in wyithe & loeb  ( 2002 ) .",
    "however variation of @xmath232 and @xmath224 has a significant effect on the gw signal .",
    "since @xmath230 is dominated by the mergers of massive ( @xmath241 ) galaxies at low redshifts ( @xmath237 ) in which supermassive bhs are thought to be ubiquitous , it should be quite insensitive to the details of the uncertain evolution in the bh mass function at higher redshifts .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath242 therefore provides robust constraints on combinations of the parameters @xmath17 , @xmath224 and @xmath232 .    in figure  [ fig6 ]",
    "we show contours of @xmath243 as a function of @xmath232 and @xmath224 .",
    "the thick grey line shows the contour at the current limit of @xmath244 .",
    "the dot shows the values @xmath86 and @xmath83 .",
    "as mentioned the value is close to the observational limits .",
    "the open circle shows the values found by ferrarese  ( 2002 ) assuming the circular velocity equals the virial velocity ( @xmath245 ) , which is the assumption implicit within our formalism .",
    "the square shows the corresponding observed values ( @xmath246 ) obtained assuming a navarro , frenk & white  ( 1997 ) profile ( bullock et al .",
    "we see that if coalescence is prompt for all binaries , then the pulsar measurements already exclude parameter space close to the currently favorable values .",
    "adoption of the values determined by ferrarese  ( 2002 ) for the bh  halo mass relation implies either that the background will soon be detected , or that the efficiency for bh binary coalescence at low redshift is @xmath247 .",
    "yu  ( 2002 ) , investigated the evolution of hypothetical bh binaries in realistic models of nearby early - type galaxies .",
    "she found that bh binaries are likely to survive for longer than a hubble time in spherical or weakly flattened / triaxial galaxies .",
    "no evidence has yet been found for bh binaries in the centers of the galaxies studied .",
    "the upper limit of the range of semimajor axes of surviving binary black holes as determined by yu  ( 2002 ) is close to the hst resolution for typical nearby galaxies ( i.e. , galaxies at virgo ) .",
    "thus , the absence of evidence for double nuclei in nearby galactic centers does not necessarily mean that they have no bh binaries ( q.  yu , private communication ) . further improvement by an order of magnitude in the upper limits on the gw background will imply that @xmath247 and that bh binaries may survive in galaxies rather than coalesce .",
    "yu  ( 2002 ) also computed the periods of surviving bh binaries .",
    "of particular importance to this study is that nearly all of the surviving bh binaries would have periods longer than 20 yrs , and would therefore not contribute to @xmath248 .",
    "we have computed the characteristic strain spectrum for gws , as well as the number of events detectable by the planned lisa observatory due to coalescing massive bh binaries . rather than adopt a phenomenological approach which is limited by the redshift horizon of current observations , we calculated the expected merger history of galaxies out to arbitrarily high redshifts under different assumptions .",
    "our model uses the observed relation ( ferrarese 2002 ) between the circular velocity of galaxies and their central bh mass , and assumes that massive bhs form in galaxies into which gas can condense and cool .",
    "an important ingredient in the prescription is the observation that the slope and normalization of the relation holds out to high redshift ( shields et al .",
    "the underlying principles of this approach have been shown to reproduce current data on the luminosity function of quasars ( wyithe & loeb 2002 ; volonteri , haardt & madau  2002 ) .",
    "we find that if bh formation is ongoing in galaxies with masses above the cooling threshhold , then reionization produces a sharp drop in the number counts of lisa sources as a function of source redshift ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . in the instance that all binary bhs proceed to coalescence our models",
    "generically predict that hundreds of events with strains @xmath249 will be detectable per year by lisa .",
    "the strongest sources have short durations and will not suffer from a confusion limit .",
    "interestingly , most of these sources originate from redshifts @xmath250 .    in the nhz regime",
    "accessible to pulsar timing experiments , we find that the amplitude of the characteristic strain spectrum ( related to the power in the gravitational wave background ) is close to current limits assuming values ( favored by wyithe & loeb 2002 ) of @xmath83 and @xmath86 for the slope and normalization relating the bh to host galactic halo mass ( see equation  [ bh ] ) . based on local observational data on early type galaxies , ferrarese  ( 2002 ) finds @xmath81 and @xmath251 ( where the circular velocity is assumed to equal the virial velocity ) , or @xmath252 and @xmath253 ( where the halo density is assumed to follow an nfw profile ) .",
    "calculations of the characteristic strain spectrum assuming these parameter sets are comparable to current limits , and already rule out only slightly different combinations of @xmath224 and @xmath232 if all binary black holes proceed to coalescence .",
