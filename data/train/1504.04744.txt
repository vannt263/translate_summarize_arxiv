    "<S> allows the derivation of the evolution equation for this case . in the weak coupling regime , the machine s output is limited by the coupling strength , restricting their application . seeking to overcome this limitation , we here analyze qhms in the virtually unexplored strong coupling regime , where separability , as well as other standard thermodynamic assumptions , may no longer hold . </S>",
    "<S> we show that strongly coupled qhms may be as efficient as their weakly coupled counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find a novel turnover behavior where their output saturates and disappears in the limit of ultra - strong coupling .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the basic tenets of standard thermodynamics is the principle of separability , which allows to clearly define and distinguish systems that interact with each other . </S>",
    "<S> when the surface to volume ratio is small , surface effects are negligible , and thermodynamic variables only depend on the volume and not on the shape . </S>",
    "<S> this argument implicitly assumes a weak coupling , restricting the interaction space to a small interface between the systems @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the assumption of weak coupling was essential for the development of open quantum system theory @xcite , in particular for the development of the kossakowski - lindblad master equation @xcite , that describes the evolution of a system interacting with a thermal bath . </S>",
    "<S> quantum heat machines ( qhms ) models @xcite use this framework to describe the evolution of the `` working fluid '' under the influence of the hot and cold baths . </S>",
    "<S> progress in this field has been recently reviewed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> qhms may operate either as engines , by extracting work power , or as refrigerators , by investing work power and cooling the cold bath . in both cases , quantum resources have been proposed @xcite in order to boost their output and efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , these models assume a weak coupling to the baths , resulting in limited qhms outputs and consequently restricting their applications .    </S>",
    "<S> the potential technological implications of high - output qhms , such as faster and more powerfull laser cooling @xcite , call for a prompt way to overcome the limitation set by the weak coupling assumption . </S>",
    "<S> however , the strong coupling limit has been virtually left unexplored due to the lack of theoretical tools to describe the `` working fluid '' evolution . </S>",
    "<S> one of the few exceptions @xcite considers the case of hamiltonian quench , which involves the switching `` on '' and `` off '' of the system - bath interaction hamiltonian , introducing an energy and efficiency cost that reduces the machine efficiency below the carnot bound . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we take a different approach by putting forward a strongly coupled continuous qhm model ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : machine ] ) , that does not require the coupling to and uncoupling from the baths , which may not be possible at nanoscale , where the system is totally embedded in thermal baths . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate its output and efficiency in order to determine its performance limits and which thermodynamic principles , e.g. , carnot bound , still hold at the strong coupling regime . addressing these issues becomes more relevant in the light of the large progress achieved in the field of strongly coupled superconductors @xcite , which makes the realizations of strongly coupled qhms potentially tractable in the near future .        </S>",
    "<S> _ model and analysis _ we employ a model for a continuous qhm similar to the one we studied previously in the weak coupling limit @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this system can operate either as an engine or a refrigerator depending on the spectrum of the reservoirs and the engine s driving frequency . </S>",
    "<S> this model is comprised by a driven two - level quantum system , that represents the working fluid , permanently coupled to the heat baths ( hot and cold ) . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of this model is governed by the hamiltonian    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the strength parameter of the cold ( hot ) bath , @xmath2 is a dimensionless parameter that defines the relative coupling strength of the tls to the mode k of the i - bath , @xmath3 are the standard pauli matrices , and @xmath4 , @xmath5 ( @xmath6,@xmath7 ) are the creation and annihilation operator of the cold ( hot ) bath mode @xmath8 the election of the hot and cold bath is somehow arbitrary and a similar analysis could be performed if they are interchanged .    </S>",
    "<S> the coupling is consider weak if @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the decay rate and is equivalent to the resonant coupling spectrum ( @xmath11 ) and @xmath12 is the bath correlation time @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> is it possible to extract work or to cool down in the strong coupling regime ? to elucidate this question , we consider that both couplings are strong . while the reduced dynamics is analytically solvable in the weak regime , in this case the perturbation expansion on the coupling strength contains infinite no - neglectable terms @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless for @xmath13 , this obstacle may be overcome by solving the problem in a more appropriate basis , where the system is effectively weakly coupled to the two baths . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by using the polaron transformation @xcite , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the transformed hamiltonian , @xmath17 , is    @xmath18    where @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the displacement operator , @xmath21 and @xmath22 . </S>",

    "<S> as we show below , the new couplings may be effectively weak even for high values of the original coupling strengths , @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the assumptions derived from the weak coupling are correct ( e.g. the transformed baths remain at thermal equilibrium ) and the master equation may be derived using standard techniques @xcite also for values of @xmath1 that break the weak coupling assumption in the original basis @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the transformed cold bath , now interacts with the tls through two different operators , @xmath26 and @xmath27 . </S>",

    "<S> this propriety lets the use of _ highly detuned baths _ in strongly coupled qhms , unlike for weakly coupled qhms that require resonant baths ( or at least resonant with linear combinations of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , the tls and driving frequency , respectively @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the polaron transformation allows the derivation of the qhm evolution for a wide range of values of the coupling strengths . </S>",

    "<S> the answer to this question is obtained from the theory of non - equilibrium thermodynamics , which introduces the frequency dependent `` local '' temperatures , @xmath51 . </S>",

    "<S> it depends on both baths coupling strength distribution and modes , making @xmath51 frequency dependent , blurring its physical interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> as we show later , it allows to establish clear thermodynamic bounds to the efficiency of the qhms and to relate them to the carnot bound . </S>",
    "<S> the precise value taken by @xmath51 , depends on how the exchange energy @xmath46 is divided between the hot and the cold baths .    in a similar manner as @xmath56 , @xmath54 not only </S>",
    "<S> includes harmonics of the cold bath , but combinations of them with modes of the hot bath . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , also the hot bath may be highly detuned from the tls frequency ( and from any linear combination with the driving frequency ) .    in the transformed basis , we use the standard weak coupling master equation based on the general floquet theory of open systems @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> .    in particular we are interested in the ultra - strong coupling regime ( @xmath67 ) to find out if qhms may have an ultra - high output . nevertheless at this limit , and assuming a weak driving with positive detuning ( @xmath68 ) , the work power dependence on the coupling strength goes as ( see suppl . </S>",
    "<S> c )    @xmath69    the conditions for work extraction ( @xmath70 ) ,    @xmath71 is derived from eq . . </S>",
    "<S> the heat currents to the baths are :    @xmath72    for ultra - strong coupled baths , the work power will decay with the coupling strength as shown in eq . . </S>",
    "<S> the exact counterpart of eq . for any value of @xmath73 </S>",
    "<S> is plotted on figure [ fig : spectrum]-inset . </S>",
    "<S> opposite to what may be expected from previous results in the weak coupling regime , work power does not increase indefinitely with the coupling strength . </S>",
    "<S> not only it saturates , but at some point , decays and vanishes . at the ultra - strong limit , the system and the baths are no longer independent , preventing work extraction which requires some degree of separability .    </S>",
    "<S> the determination of the engine efficiency , as well as the cooling power ( in the refrigerator operation mode ) , is a more subtle issue . </S>",
    "<S> a naive guess would be to consider @xmath74 , which is positive , as the incoming heat flow from the hot bath and to define the efficiency as    @xmath75    which can take any value , even above carnot limit . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the lack of separability complicates the determination of how much energy is exchanged with each bath through the coupling spectrum @xmath42 . only a fraction , @xmath76 , of @xmath74 is originated in the hot bath . therefore the correct efficiency expression is    @xmath77    from eq . we conclude that _ the carnot bound may be reached _ , but not surpassed , by the appropriate choice of driving frequency . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , strongly coupled machines are as efficient as their weakly coupled counterpart .    in a similar way </S>",
    "<S> , one can calculate the cooling power for the refrigeration operation . </S>",
    "<S> this sets the opposite condition on the frequencies : @xmath78 , making @xmath79 , which can erroneously be confused with the cooling power . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of separability between both baths ( the dependence of @xmath80 on both baths operators ) mixes the heat flows between both baths and part of @xmath74 is heat flowing to the cold bath . the correct expression for the cooling power is @xmath81 and is limited by the carnot bound for refrigerators . </S>",
    "<S> the cooling power has a similar dependence on the coupling strength as the work power and also decays and vanishes for ultra - strong coupling .    </S>",
    "<S> an ideal platform to test our results are superconducting quantum circuits , where the almost unexplored strong coupling regime has been recently achieved @xcite , showing astounding @xmath82 ratios of around @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , recent theoretical studies have shown that a @xmath84coupling between quantum microwaves and artificial josephson - based atoms can be pushed up to @xmath85 @xcite , which is well beyond the critical point ( @xmath86 ) at which the power efficiency is maximum . </S>",
    "<S> our proposal consists of a periodically driven superconducting flux qubit with tunable gap @xcite , where the main loop is coupled to the hot bath ( @xmath87 coupling ) , and the @xmath88loop is coupled to the cold bath ( @xmath89 coupling ) . in order to bring the @xmath89 coupling to the strong regime , we galvanically couple the @xmath88loop to the open transmission line that plays the role of the cold bath </S>",
    "<S> .    _ conclusions _ the possibility of work extraction and cooling in the strong coupling regime was shown . </S>",
    "<S> even though some thermodynamic principles , as the standard kms condition , do not longer hold at this regime due to the lack of separability between the baths , the operation of the qhms may be described in a non - equilibrium framework . </S>",
    "<S> this is advantageous because it shows that important principles , as the carnot bound , still hold in the strong coupling regime . </S>",
    "<S> the introduction of frequency - local temperatures , that account for the different baths contributions to the heat flows , are useful to determine how the heat flows are divided between baths and to correctly calculate the qhms efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> as we have shown , continuous strongly coupled qhms , as their weakly coupled counterparts , avoid the efficiency reduction due to the coupling turning on and off and keep the carnot bound which _ can be reached _ under the appropriate driving frequency .    </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of the `` non - equilibrium '' temperatures is related to the loss of separability . even though both baths , in the transformed basis , are in equilibrium , the heat flows mixes the contribution of both of them , causing an effective deviation from equilibrium .    </S>",
    "<S> there are similarities between weakly and strongly coupled qhms , but the differences should not be overlooked . while weakly coupled qhms require baths with modes resonant to the tls ( or linear combinations with the driving frequency ) , strongly coupled qhms operate also for highly detuned baths , because harmonics of the strongly coupled bath modes also contribute to both coupling spectra </S>",
    "<S> . an important feature of strongly coupled qhms is that , differently to their weakly coupled counterpart , where the outputs are proportional to the square of the coupling strength , work and cooling power saturate at some point and for ultra - strongly coupled machines they fall down as the coupling strength increases . </S>",
    "<S> this is a consequence of the lost of separability as the coupling strength increases , and shows that qhms require some degree of separability to operate .    in order to optimize qhms output </S>",
    "<S> the `` right '' coupling strength is needed , resembling the quantum goldilocks effect @xcite found in photosynthetic systems . </S>",
    "<S> the latter should be further investigated to determine if evolution fine - tuned the coupling strength to the baths in order to maximize their chemical power output . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the turnover behavior may be corroborated experimentally using superconducting qubits @xcite .    </S>",
