    "understanding the reionization of the intergalactic medium is important for cosmology for at least two reasons .",
    "how reionization occurred provides crucial data on the first ( and possibly second ) generation of sources , while thomson scattering of the photons of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by free electrons suppresses `` primordial '' anisotropies in the cmb imprinted at @xmath5 .",
    "the first sources are not well understood ( see barkana & loeb 2001 for a recent review ) , but there are several relevant observational constraints .",
    "the observation of quasars at @xmath6 that show strong hi absorption @xcite indicates that the universe had at least 1% of the total hydrogen content in neutral form @xcite at @xmath7 , with this neutral mass fraction rapidly decreasing at lower redshifts ( songaila & cowie 2002 ) .",
    "this is a strong indication that the epoch of reionization ended at @xmath8 . on the other hand ,",
    "the observed anisotropies of the cmb indicate that the total optical depth to thomson scattering is not extremely high , suggesting that reionization could nt have started at redshifts much higher than about 30 @xcite .",
    "what happened between redshifts 6 and 30 is unknown .",
    "there has been extensive modeling and numerical simulation , but without a good understanding of the sources robust conclusions are difficult to draw .",
    "many studies have concluded that reionization should happen fairly rapidly @xcite , but several recent studies have suggested ( wyithe & loeb 2003 ; cen 2003 ; haiman & holder 2003 : hereafter paper i ) that reionization is an extended process , perhaps even with multiple epochs of reionization .    in recent work ( kaplinghat et al . 2003 ; hereafter k03 ) it was shown that a two - step reionization process could have an observable signature in the large - angle cmb polarization anisotropies that would provide unique information on the process of reionization in this difficult - to - probe redshift range . in this work ,",
    "we extend these calculations to physically motivated reionization histories provided by semi - analytic models and address the possibility that non - trivial ionization histories can introduce a bias in estimates of the optical depth @xmath0 if a simple one - step model is used to fit the data .",
    "the results from wmap have opened a new window on the dark ages .",
    "several key cosmological parameters have been measured to high precision and wmap has observed the signature of free electrons at @xmath9 for the first time @xcite .",
    "previously , there had been practically no information about the ionization state of the igm for @xmath10 .",
    "the optical depth to thomson scattering is an important cosmological parameter .",
    "the temperature power spectrum only allows constraints on the normalization of the primordial gravitational potential power spectrum @xmath11 in the combination @xmath12 , so a determination of @xmath0 allows a determination of the amplitude of potential ( and mass ) fluctuations .",
    "there has been much recent controversy over the amplitude of mass fluctuations on scales of @xmath13mpc , @xmath1 , as summarized in recent parameter estimates @xcite .",
    "estimates have varied by nearly a factor of two between different methods of determination within the last few years , so precise and accurate cmb estimates would be invaluable . with accurate determinations of @xmath1 it should be possible to put strong constraints on the nature of the dark energy @xcite .",
    "in the next section we describe the models that are used to generate a zoo of ionization histories , while   3 demonstrates the effects of non - trivial ionization histories on cmb polarization anisotropies and parameter estimation . in ",
    "4 we provide a crude example of how it is possible to reduce any biases induced by an unknown ionization history , and we close with a discussion .    as a fiducial model",
    "we assume cosmological parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and an initial matter power spectrum @xmath18 in agreement with recent results from wmap @xcite .",
    "we employ semi  analytical models of reionization , in order to derive a sample of physically motivated ionization histories .",
    "details of the models are laid out in paper i , and we only briefly review the main framework here .",
    "the models assume that the total volume fraction of ionized regions is being driven by ionizing sources located in dark matter halos whose abundance is described by the n  body simulations of jenkins et al .",
    "( 2001 ) we distinguish dark matter halos in three different ranges of virial temperatures , as follows :    = @xmath19 @xmath20 = @xmath21 = @xmath22 = ( type ii ) + @xmath23 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath24 ( type ia ) + @xmath21 @xmath25 ( type ib )    we will hereafter refer to these three different types of halos as type ii , type ia , and type ib halos .",
    "each type of halo plays a different role in the reionization history . in short",
    ", type ii halos can host the first ionizing sources , but only in the neutral regions of the igm , and only if @xmath26 molecules are present in sufficient quantity to allow efficient cooling ; type ia halos can only form new ionizing sources in the neutral igm regions , but irrespective of the @xmath26 abundance , and type ib halos can form ionizing sources regardless of the @xmath26 abundance , and whether they are in the ionized or neutral phase of the igm .    the contribution of each halo to reionization",
    "is quantified by explicitly computing the expansion of the ionized strmgren region , dictated by the source luminosity and the background igm density and the clumping factor @xmath27 .",
    "we allow the three different sources above to have different efficiencies @xmath28 of injecting ionizing radiation into the igm . here",
    "@xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the fraction of baryons in the halo that turns into stars ( @xmath31 in normal stars @xmath32 in type ii halos ) ; @xmath33 is the mean number of ionizing photons produced by an atom cycled through stars , averaged over the initial mass function ( imf ) of the stars ( @xmath34 for a normal salpeter imf , and up to a factor of 20 higher for a population of massive , metal  free stars ( bromm , kudritzki & loeb 2001 ; schaerer 2002 ) ; and @xmath35 is the fraction of these ionizing photons that escapes into the igm ( @xmath36 for types ia , b halos , and @xmath37 for type ii halos ) . in our models , we also allow the possibility that radiative feedback effects photo  dissociate @xmath26 molecules below some critical redshift @xmath38 , and we self ",
    "consistently exclude the type ii and type ia halos from forming any ionizing sources inside regions that had already been reionized .",
    "we adopt a fixed @xmath39 in all models ; variations in the clumping factor can be absorbed into changes in the efficiencies with redshift .    in summary ,",
    "our model has four parameters : the overall efficiencies , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and the redshift @xmath38 at which @xmath26 dissociative feedback sets in .",
    "we here use 5 different models that are broadly representative .",
    "three of the models were chosen to have optical depth equal to that measured by the wmap experiment @xcite and two others were chosen to investigate the effects of larger or smaller optical depths .",
    "details of the models can be found in paper i.    model 1 assumes that for massive halos the stellar imf is not metal - free ( pop ii ) while minihalos ( cooled by @xmath43 ) form metal  free stars that produce @xmath44 times more ionizing photons . in terms of model parameters",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath45 .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath43 starts to be destroyed at @xmath46 .",
    "model 2 assumes that minihalos do not contribute to reionization ( efficient destruction of @xmath43 ) and that the efficiency in larger halos is increased to @xmath47 . in model 3",
    "it is assumed ( as in wyithe & loeb 2003 ; cen 2003 ) that there is a sharp transition from metal - free to normal stars at @xmath48 .",
    "model 4 assumes that minihalos are more effective at forming stars than in model 1 , with @xmath49 and has molecules being destroyed at @xmath50 .",
    "finally , model 5 assumes that feedback from star formation becomes efficient at destroying molecules at @xmath51 but the same efficiencies as model 1 .",
    "the ionization histories in our models are shown in figure  1 .",
    "as discussed in depth in paper i , the physics of reionization is rich in features that can naturally lead to distinctive ionization histories .",
    "these features can arise because of ( 1 ) the different types of coolants in halos with virial temperatures above and below @xmath52k , ( 2 ) the different response of different halos to radiative feedback on the @xmath26 chemistry , and to photoionization feedback on gas infall , and ( 3 ) the different properties of metal  free and normal stellar populations .    in all models , we assume singly - ionized helium traces ionized hydrogen ( i.e. , 1.08 free electrons per hydrogen atom for a completely ionized universe ) . in",
    "what follows , discussion of @xmath53 ignores helium ( e.g. , complete ionization is referred to as @xmath54 ) , but the factor of 1.08 is included in all calculations .",
    "we modified cmbfast @xcite to use the ionization histories from the previous section to generate temperature ( tt ) , polarization ( ee ) , and cross anisotropy ( te ) power spectra , @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively .",
    "a similar modification was done by @xcite but for an ionization history extracted from a numerical simulation , and by @xcite using different ionization histories .",
    "the ionization histories are shown in figure 1 and the corresponding power spectra are shown in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "note in figure 2 that for larger optical depths , there are secondary bumps in the @xmath57 .",
    "these are thoroughly explained in @xcite . for the @xmath58 ( shown in figure 3 )",
    "an important difference is that we are correlating quantities which , for each value of @xmath59 , have different angular frequencies on the sky .",
    "the polarization has angular frequency @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the conformal times today and at the onset of reionization ) since it is projecting from the epoch of reionization where it was created .",
    "the temperature has a correspondingly higher angular frequency since it is projecting from the ( further ) last - scattering surface .",
    "the matched angular frequencies of @xmath63 correlated with @xmath63 lead to secondary peaks in @xmath57 , whereas the mismatched angular frequencies of @xmath64 and @xmath63 wash out the fluctuation power and do not lead to secondary peaks in @xmath58 .    as found in k03 , for highly sensitive experiments approaching the cosmic - variance limit",
    ", almost all the sensitivity to @xmath0 comes from @xmath57 .",
    "this is because @xmath65 whereas @xmath66 and because the fractional uncertainty in @xmath57 is smaller than the fractional uncertainty in @xmath58 in the cosmic variance limit .",
    "these fractional uncertainties would be equal in the limit of perfect correlation ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "we normalize @xmath68 by requiring that the temperature fluctuation at @xmath69 is 150 @xmath70 .",
    "this choice is arbitrary , but largely irrelevant for our purposes . varying the ionization history with this product fixed produces no change in the angular power spectra at @xmath71 ( except due to non - linear effects at @xmath72 ) .",
    "note that since @xmath73 has been measured well in this range , a higher optical depth requires a larger normalization of @xmath74 in order to agree with the data . as outlined in k03",
    ", variations in the fiducial model , such as a slight tilt or a slightly different normalization , will not have a large effect on our conclusions .    to explore questions of bias in @xmath0",
    "we see how well purely phenomenological models with one or two sharp transitions can be used to fit our physical models ( 1)-(5 ) . for measurement uncertainties we assume gaussian , white detector noise and ignore beam effects .",
    "we calculate the likelihood of the phenomenological models , given one of the physical models as the `` data '' , denoted now with a @xmath75 superscript ( see k03 ) : @xmath76 { c_{t\\ell}}-{c_{c\\ell}}^2 )   \\nonumber \\\\ + { [ { c_{e\\ell}}+w^{-1 } ] { c_{t\\ell}}^{d } + { c_{t\\ell}}{c_{e\\ell}}^{d } - 2{c_{c\\ell}}{c_{c\\ell}}^{d } \\over   [ { c_{e\\ell}}+w^{-1 } ] { c_{t\\ell}}- { c_{c\\ell}}^2 } \\bigr ] \\quad .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above , @xmath77 is the fraction of sky coverage ( which we take to be unity ) , and @xmath78 is the weight per unit solid angle for polarization measurements .",
    "we have assumed that for our purposes we can ignore detector noise in the measurement of the temperature power spectrum .",
    "note that we have included the effects of all the data , i.e. , ee , tt , and te correlations are all implicitly taken into account .",
    "we have not included possible effects of foregrounds . for wmap , we assume @xmath79 , roughly the expected two - year two channel sensitivity ( allowing other frequencies to be used for foreground removal ) while for planck we assume @xmath80 , corresponding roughly to one year and two frequencies .",
    "we adopt these values as representative of the expected performance of the instruments , but should be viewed as order of magnitude estimates .",

    "the misfit is very large , in one case a shift in the misfit statistic of more than 100 ( roughly `` 10 @xmath95 '' ) for a cosmic variance limited experiment .",
    "this confirms that there is significantly more information in the large angle polarization signal than simply the optical depth , as shown in k03 . for the most basic reionization signal",
    "the misfit is just above the `` 3 @xmath95 '' level for cosmic variance limits , indicating that if reionization happens fairly quickly the exact nature of the transition is unimportant and the dominant effect on the cmb signal will be only that of the optical depth .",

    "part of this is due to the higher optical depth of our fiducial model , providing more signal .",

    "for the more exotic ionization histories the optical depth can be seen to be significantly biased for cosmic variance level measurements , with the direction and the magnitude of the bias sensitive to the details of the ionization history . using the incorrect ionization history for model",
    "fitting introduces a systematic error in the value of @xmath0 with a direction and magnitude that depends on the details of @xmath100 . as seen in models 3 and 4 ,",
    "offsets between the true and derived optical depths could easily be @xmath1010.01 for planck .",
    "determination of the optical depth , and thus the matter power spectrum amplitude , will be limited by a lack of understanding of the nature of the reionization process .",
    "for wmap , it appears that the derived optical depth assuming a single sharp transition will not be highly biased for any of the reionization models that we consider , given that the estimated uncertainty in @xmath0 is @xmath102 ( k03 ) .",
    "there is information in the shape of the large angle polarization power spectra , so it is informative to see what can be gleaned . in figure 4",
    "we show the results of an analysis similar to that of k03 .",
    "we used a simple two - step model , where it is assumed that a transition from partial ionization to full ionization occurred at @xmath103 and that a transition from nearly zero to an intermediate ( constant ) ionization fraction , @xmath53 , occurred at @xmath104 .",
    "we examine two fiducial models , one with @xmath105 and the other with @xmath106 , with @xmath53 values chosen so that both have @xmath107 .",
    "we then investigate the accuracy with which @xmath0 and @xmath108 can be recovered assuming noise levels typical for wmap or expected for planck by once again taking the fiducial model as the data and evaluating the likelihood ( eq .",
    "1 ) as a function of the two parameters of the model . figure 4 displays contours of constant likelihood for the three experimental cases . at noise levels",
    "appropriate for wmap it will be very difficult to differentiate between different models that yield the same optical depth ( as pointed out in k03 and verified by kogut et al .",
    "2003 ) , but planck would be able to determine the onset of partial reionization quite well and a cosmic variance limited experiment would be able to determine this onset very precisely .",
    "there will therefore likely be suggestions in the data itself pointing to better models for measuring @xmath0 .    in the previous section",
    ", we saw that the largest biases arise in the cases where the misfit statistic is also large .",
    "therefore when the measured @xmath0 is highly biased the quality of fit will probably also be bad , indicating a possibly contaminated result .",
