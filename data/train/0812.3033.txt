    "it is well known that the decay rate and energy of an excited atom ( atom * ) may be significantly affected near a dispersive surface due to the resonant coupling of the atom to the surface polariton mode(s ) of the system @xcite .",
    "owing to the resonant energy shift of the atom , a strong modification of the related atom*-surface force leading even to the atom - surface repulsion has been predicted @xcite and observed @xcite . based on the sherkunov formula for the interaction energy between an excited and a ground - state atom @xcite , we have recently pointed out that the atom*-atom van der waals potential / force is also strongly enhanced near a dispersive surface whenever the transition frequency of the excited atom coincides with the frequency of a resonant mode of the system @xcite .",
    "indeed , consider an excited ( @xmath0 ) atom a and a ground - state ( @xmath1 ) atom b embedded in an inhomogeneous magnetoelectric system described by the permittivity @xmath2 and permeability @xmath3 .",
    "assuming , for simplicity , two - level isotropic atoms , the interaction potential between the atoms is according to @xcite [ eq . ( 68 ) ] given by    [ uab ] @xmath4 @xmath5,\\\\ \\fl u_{ab}^{\\rm r}({\\bf r}_a,{\\bf r}_b)&=&-\\frac{{\\rm re}[\\alpha^b_g(\\omega_a)]\\omega^4_a}{3c^4}|{\\bf d}^a_{eg}|^2\\tr\\left[\\mathbf{g}({\\bf r}_a,{\\bf r}_b;\\omega_a)\\cdot\\mathbf{g}^*({\\bf r}_b,{\\bf r}_a;\\omega_a)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are off - resonant and resonant part of the potential , respectively . in eq .",
    "( [ uab ] ) , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) are the atomic polarizabilities whereas @xmath10 and @xmath11 are , respectively , the transition frequency and the dipole matrix element of atom @xmath12 .",
    "the dyadic @xmath13 is the classical green function for the system satisfying [ @xmath14 is unit dyadic ]",
    "@xmath15   \\mathbf{g}(\\omega;{\\bf r},{\\bf r ' } )   = 4\\pi\\mathbf{i}\\delta({\\bf r}-{\\bf r ' } ) ,   \\label{gf}\\ ] ] with the outgoing wave condition at infinity . poles of this green function in the complex @xmath16-plane correspond to frequencies of the system resonant ( polariton ) modes . accordingly , whenever @xmath17 is close to the frequency @xmath18 of a resonant mode the green function behaves as @xmath19 and , owing to the factor @xmath20 , the van der waals potential is resonantly enhanced with respect to its free - space value .    in order to verify the above considerations and",
    "estimate the enhancement of the atom*-atom van der waals interaction , in @xcite we have considered the interaction between the atoms in front of the interface between two media under the circumstances of the resonant coupling of the excited atom to the surface polariton mode of the system . here , we complement this work , by considering the atom*-atom interaction across the interface between two media , as depicted in fig .",
    "to account for the local - field effects , we adopt the onsager model and therefore assume small empty spherical cavities around the atoms . provided that @xmath21 , with @xmath22 being cavity radii and @xmath23 an effective cutoff frequency in ( [ uab ] ) , the green function for this system can [ to the order of @xmath24 be written as @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 and ( @xmath27 ) @xmath28 @xmath29e^{i\\beta z_a - i\\beta_mz_b } \\label{g}\\ ] ] is the green function for the system unperturbed by the onsager cavities @xcite . here @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the perpendicular wave vectors in the media whereas @xmath32 are the fresnel transmission coefficients for the interface .",
    "considering the situation where the atomic distances from the interface between the media are small compared to @xmath33 ( but larger than @xmath22 ) we can neglect the retardation of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the green function in the nonretarded approximation @xmath34 is easily obtained using the prescription @xcite @xmath35 and we find @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the average dielectric function of the two media in contact . as seen ,",
    "this green function is the same as the nonretarded green function in an infinite medium described by the dielectric function @xmath38 .",
    "accordingly , going back to the @xmath39-space recalling that @xmath40 we finally arrive at @xmath41    inserting the above green function in eq .",
    "( [ uab ] ) and neglecting ( small ) off - resonant part of the potential , we find that @xmath42 is given by @xmath43|{\\bf d}^a_{eg}|^2|d(\\omega_a)|^2|d_m(\\omega_a)|^2 } { |\\overline{\\varepsilon}(\\omega_a)|^2r^6}.\\ ] ] and is enlarged by a factor of @xmath44 [ 2\\varepsilon(\\omega_a)+1][2\\varepsilon_m(\\omega_a)+1]}\\right|^2\\ ] ] with respect to its free - space value .",
    "evidently , the potential is resonantly enhanced whenever @xmath17 coincides with the frequency of an interface ( surface ) mode or with the frequency of a resonant mode of the onsager cavities .",
    "we also observe that in this configuration , as long as the atoms are close to the interface , @xmath45 is isotropic and depends only on the distance between the atoms in contrast to the situation when both atoms are on the same side of the interface @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the van der waals forces on atoms @xmath46 obey the third newton law @xmath47|{\\bf d}^a_{eg}|^2g(\\omega_a ) } { r^7}\\hat{\\bf r}=-{\\bf f}_b({\\bf r}_b,{\\bf r}_a)\\ ] ] despite the inhomogeneity of the system .",
    "of course , this is not the case with total vacuum - field forces on atoms since they also include the respective casimir - polder forces .",
    "in order to compare the surface enhanced van der waals interaction between the atoms in the present configuration and previously considered one @xcite , we consider the same interface and therefore assume the atom @xmath12 located in the vacuum [ @xmath48 and the atom @xmath49 embedded in a nonmagnetic medium that is around a resonance at @xmath50 described by the dielectric function @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are background and static dielectric constant , respectively , whereas @xmath54 is the corresponding damping .",
    "quantity @xmath55 , denoted as @xmath56 in @xcite , is a measure of the coupling between the medium polarization and the field .",
    "the inverse of the average dielectric function of the system can therefore be written as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the surface - mode frequency . in conjunction with eq .",
    "( [ uabf ] ) , this equation explicitly demonstrates resonant enhancement of @xmath42 when @xmath59 .",
    "we note , however , that @xmath60 also exhibits a resonant structure . indeed , with eq .",
    "( [ em ] ) this function reads @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the surface - mode frequency of the onsager cavity . since @xmath63 is pretty close to @xmath64 the enhancements of @xmath42 due to two resonances ( partially ) combine .",
    "indeed , for small damping we find that @xmath65 so that the peak value of the surface enhanced van der waals potential / force given by @xmath66 is enlarged by ( almost ) nine times due to the local - field effect .",
    "we illustrate these considerations in fig .",
    "[ upo ] where we have plotted @xmath7 with and without local- field correction factor as a function of @xmath17 .",
    "note that the local - field corrected potential ( full line ) is additionally scaled by a factor of 10 . to obtain these curves",
    "we have let in eq .",
    "( [ uabf ] ) @xmath67 and expressed the potential in units @xmath68 .",
    "medium parameters are taken the same as in @xcite and correspond to sapphire around the surface polariton resonance at @xmath69 @xcite whereas parameters of the atom b are chosen quite arbitrarily .",
    "we see that , besides a resonant structure at @xmath70 as would exist in the free - space , the potential exhibits also resonances at @xmath64 and @xmath71 corresponding to the surface and local - field enhanced interaction between the atoms , respectively . as mentioned ,",
    "owing to the proximity of these two resonances each peak is actually due to the combined surface and local - field effects .",
    "thus , for the local - field corrected surface enhanced potential @xmath72 whereas for the potential without the local - field correction the enhancement factor is 8.8 times smaller , @xmath73,which is of the same order as @xmath74 found in @xcite for the case when the atoms are in vacuum close to the sapphire surface .",
    "similarly , we find for the total enhancement factor at the onsager cavity resonance @xmath75 whereas the enhancement factor without the contribution of the surface - mode resonance at @xmath64 is @xmath76 .",
    "in this work , we have considered the local - field corrected van der waals interaction between an excited and a ground state atom across the interface between two media .",
    "we have demonstrated that the ( nonretarded ) atom*-atom potential is of the same form as in a homogeneous medium described by the average dielectric function of the two media in contact .",
    "accordingly , as a function of the transition frequency of the excited atom , the potential generally exhibits resonances associated with the interface ( surface ) modes and with modes of small spherical cavities around the atoms figuring in the onsager model for the local field .",
    "numerical calculation performed for the vacuum - sapphire system reveals that in such systems , owing to the close surface and the onsager cavity resonances , the van der waals potential can be at the ( vacuum - medium ) surface mode frequency enhanced by over three orders of magnitude of which ( nearly ) one order of magnitude is due to the enhancement of the local - field correction factor for the medium .",
