    "last years , an increasing interest to the problem of distance between quantum states is observed .",
    "different motivations of this activity can be found in such fields as quantum cryptography , quantum communications , or quantum computing .",
    "here we discuss the topic mainly from the point of view of quantum optics . in view of recent impressive progress in creating and detecting various types of nonclassical states of light or cooled particles in electromagnetic traps ,",
    "the problem of measures of distinguishability or closeness between different quantum states becomes actual .",
    "for example , in quantum optics , the glauber coherent states @xcite @xmath0 are considered frequently as reference states ( @xmath1 means the fock state with the definite number of photons ) , so that the ( pure ) states different from ( [ def - coh ] ) are called sometimes as _",
    "nonclassical states_. but what is the quantitative measure of the `` nonclassicality ? ''",
    "the simplest option is to use the so - called mandel s parameter , @xmath2 , which equals zero for all coherent states , since they have the poissonian photon statistics .",
    "however , this parameter is adequate for a limited class of states .",
    "consider , for instance , the _ even and odd coherent states _ introduced in @xcite @xmath3\\right)^{-1/2 } \\left(| \\alpha\\rangle \\pm | -\\alpha\\rangle\\right ) .",
    "\\label{ev - od}\\ ] ] in this case , mandel s parameter equals @xmath4 , and it shows distinctly the qualitative difference between the states @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , but only for small values of @xmath8 . if @xmath9 , then @xmath10 , although the states @xmath11 are still quite different from the coherent state .",
    "moreover , for _ generalized coherent states _ @xcite @xmath12| n\\rangle\\ ] ] we have identically @xmath13 for any function @xmath14 , although the state @xmath15 may be essentially different from the glauber state @xmath16 . for example , the choice @xmath17 , @xmath18 gives the so - called yurke - stoler state @xcite @xmath19 which is considered , equally with the even and odd states , as a representattive of a large family of `` schrdinger cat states . ''",
    "the concept of distance gives a possibility to characterize more precisely the neighbourhood or similarity between the quantum states .",
    "however , the existing approaches ( see section  [ revdist ] ) seem to suffer from certain drawbacks .",
    "some of the available definitions of a distance are too complicated to perform concrete calculations .",
    "on the other hand , some consequences of the traditional approaches , being correct mathematically , contradict the physical intuition .",
    "for example , the known definitions yield the same , at once , maximum possible value of the distance between any two orthogonal pure states , whereas from the physical point of view , the distance between the first and the @xmath20th fock states seems to be much greater than that between , say , the @xmath20th and the @xmath21th states .",
    "the distance measures based on the density operators alone are not sensible to the difference in energies .    in the present paper",
    ", we propose new measures which distinguish different orthogonal states and which are simple enough to perform the calculations , at least for the most important families of states used in quantum optics . in our approach ,",
    "the distance depends not only on the density operators alone , but also on some extra fixed positively definite operator . of course , following this way we meet the problem of the nonuniqueness in the choice of this additional `` polarization '' operator .",
    "nonetheless , such a nonuniqueness seems not crucial in many physical applications , where the special role of some operators ( like the hamiltonian or the quantum number operator ) is evident from the beginning .",
    "another goal is to provide an analysis of the distance problem in terms of the quasiprobability distributions and in the framework of the `` classical - like '' formulation of quantum mechanics proposed recently in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ revdist ] , we give a review of the existing approaches to the quantum distance problem . in section  [ hilb ] ,",
    "we concentrate on the properties of the hilbert - schmidt distance ( hsd ) and we express it in terms of the quasiprobability functions and ordered moments . in section  [ sec - ener - rho ] , we propose several definitions of the energy - sensitive distance in terms of the statistical operators ( density matrices ) . in section  [ sec - examples ] , the distinctions between different definitions are illustrated by examples of the fock , coherent , `` schrdinger cat , '' squeezed , phase , and thermal states .",
    "the `` classical - like '' distances between quantum states are considered in section  [ dist - clas ] .",
    "the last section contains brief conclusions .",
    "the distance between two objects @xmath22 and @xmath23 is defined usually as a scalar real function satisfying the following properties : @xmath24 the property ( iii ) has a clear geometrical meaning as the _ triangle inequality _ , and it implies rather strong limitations on the possible choice of the function @xmath25 . if the `` objects '' @xmath22 and @xmath23 are different pure quantum states , then the distance must be some functional written in terms of the hilbert space vectors , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , representing the states .",
    "one should remember , however , that the set of quantum states is in one - to - one correspondence not with the whole hilbert space of the wave functions , but with its projective factor space , since the vectors @xmath28 and @xmath29 describe the same state .",
    "all the requirements are satisfied , e.g. , for the _ fubiny - study distance _",

    "one obtains , both from ( [ fubstu ] ) and ( [ primit ] ) , the infinitesimal distance along the evolution curve in the projective hilbert space @xmath36 the definition ( [ infdist ] ) was used in studies devoted to the geometrical aspects of the quantum evolution and generalizations of the time - energy uncertainty relations @xcite . for a family of states @xmath37 dependent on a continuous vector parameter @xmath38",
    ", one can introduce the riemannian metrics according to @xmath39 and measure not the `` shortest '' distance ( [ d - us ] ) , but the distance along a geodesics on a curved manifold , which can be much greater than the `` shortest '' one .",
    "the concrete examples of the geometries on the manifolds corresponding to the most known continuous families of quantum states ( namely , coherent , squeezed , and displaced states ) were studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "wootters @xcite proposed the distance between the pure states in the form of the angle between the corresponding rays in the hilbert space @xmath40 . for infinitesimaly close states ,",
    "the differential form of this distance coincides ( up to a coefficient ) with ( [ infdist ] ) @xcite .",

    "more sophisticated definitions of the distance were given , e.g. , in  @xcite .",
    "however , they are so complicated from the point of view of calculations , that no explicit examples were considered",
    ".    one of the most frequently cited in the physical literature definitions is the so - called _ bures - uhlmann distance _ ( bu - distance ) @xcite .",
    "it has the form ( see also @xcite ) @xmath53 where the operator @xmath54 is defined as the _ positively semidefinite hermitian operator _ satisfying the relation @xmath55 .",
    "this operator is unique .",
    "although the right - hand side of ( [ d - buruhl ] ) seems asymmetrical with respect to @xmath56 and @xmath57 , actually @xmath58 @xcite . for _ pure _ quantum states @xmath59 , the bu - distance coincides with the `` minimal '' distance ( [ primit ] ) due to the relations @xmath60 .",
    "if one of the states is pure , then @xmath61 however , the calculations are much more involved in the generic case of nondiagonal statistical operators , so that the explicit forms of the bures - uhlmann distance were found only for finite - dimensional @xmath62@xmath63@xmath62 density matrices ( especially , for @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) @xcite and recently for squeezed thermal states @xcite and displaced thermal states @xcite .",
    "a simple expression for the distance between quantum states , enabling to perform calculations for the most important classes of states ( at least in the problems of quantum optics ) , is based on the hilbert - schmidt norm @xmath66 .",

    "it is accepted that quantum states are described in terms of the wave functions ( state vectors in the hilbert space ) or density matrices ( statistical operators ) . however , these _ complex - valued _ objects have rather indirect relations to the results of measurements , which are expressed in terms of real positive probabilities . recently , a new formulation of quantum mechanics in terms of positive classical probability distributions was proposed @xcite .",
    "it is a natural consequence of the concepts of the so - called _ symplectic tomography _ developed in @xcite .",
    "let us introduce the two - parameter family of quadrature operators @xmath249 , @xmath250 , where @xmath251 and @xmath252 are the usual coordinate and momentum operators ( in one dimension , for simplicity ) .",
    "it can be shown that the probability distribution @xmath253 of the real eigenvalues of the hermitian operator @xmath254 is given by the following integral transform of the wigner function : @xmath255 the reciprocal transform @xmath256 w_{\\mu\\nu}(x ) \\label{recipr}\\ ] ] enables to express any wigner function ( and , consequently , any density matrix ) in terms of the positive marginal probability distributions @xmath257 which can be obtained , in principle , directly from an experiment with the aid of the homodyne detection schemes .",
    "consequently , the description in terms of the family of classical distributions @xmath257 is completely equivalent to the standard description in terms of the density matrix or the wave function .",
    "this fact is the basis of the `` classical - like '' formulation of quantum mechanics @xcite . in this formulation",
    ", every quantum state is described not by a single complex - valued function @xmath258 or @xmath259 , but by an infinite set of _ classical positive probability distributions _",
    "@xmath260 , @xmath250 .",
    "for example , the fock state of the harmonic oscillator @xmath261 is described by the family of the marginal distributions  @xcite @xmath262 where @xmath263 is the hermite polynomial , while the marginal distribution @xmath264 of the vacuum state reads @xmath265    now , considering the quantum states described by two different sets of the marginal distributions @xmath266 and @xmath267 we can define the `` classical - like '' distance between these states as @xmath268 where @xmath269 is some _ classical _ distance between the distributions @xmath266 and @xmath267 .",
    "a positive weight function @xmath270 is introduced to ensure the convergence of the integral over @xmath271 .",
    "evidently , if the `` partial distance '' @xmath269 satisfies the triangle inequality for all fixed values of @xmath271 , this inequality remains valid after multiplying by the positive function @xmath270 and the subsequent integration over @xmath271 .",
    "let us consider , for example , the `` kakutani - hellinger - matusita distance '' @xcite between two real nonnegative distributions @xmath272 and @xmath273 @xmath274^{1/2}.\\ ] ] taking into account the normalization condition we arrive at the `` classical - like '' analogue of the bures - uhlmann distance @xmath275^{1/2}. \\label{clasdis}\\ ] ] the `` classical - like '' analogue of the jmg - distance ( [ d - jauch - dieks ] ) is obtained if one chooses for @xmath276 the classical kolmogorov distance @xcite @xmath277    to illustrate the new approach , let us consider the @xmath278-distance ( [ clasdis ] ) between two coherent states @xmath5 and @xmath151 .",
    "each of these states is described by means of the families of the marginal distributions like @xmath279 ^ 2 } { \\mu^2 + \\nu^2}\\right),\\ ] ] @xmath280 introducing the polar coordinates in the @xmath281 plane , @xmath282 , @xmath283 , we see that the @xmath278-distance between the coherent states depends on @xmath144 only : @xmath284 \\right\\}^{1/2 } \\label{heldiscoh}\\ ] ] ( here @xmath285 is the phase of the complex number @xmath286 ) . it is convenient to choose the weight function @xmath287 independent on @xmath288 and to impose the condition",
    ". then for close coherent states , we have @xmath290 if @xmath145 .",
    "when @xmath291 , the @xmath278-distance tends to the constant value @xmath292 .",
    "the integral over @xmath271 can be calculated explicitly for classical - like _ distinguishability measures _ ( dm ) which are defined by the same formula ( [ def - clasdis ] ) but without imposing the requirement ( [ treug ] ) ( the triangle inequality ) on the function @xmath269 .",
    "the distinguishability measures are frequently used in the classical statistics and the information theory @xcite .",
    "their applications to quantum mechanical problems were discussed recently in @xcite .",
    "the most known examples of classical dm are the _ bhattacharyya coefficient _ @xcite @xmath293 and the _ kullback - liebler distinguishability measure _ @xcite @xmath294\\ln\\frac{p_1(x)}{p_2(x)}. \\label{kull}\\ ] ] for coherent states ,",
    "both these measures yield similar dependences on the parameters @xmath149 and @xmath150 , which differ only in a scale factor ( we assume the same weight function @xmath270 as above ) : @xmath295 these quantum dm are unbounded when @xmath291 , but they do not satisfy the triangle inequality .",
    "let us summarise the main results of the paper .",
    "we have obtained new inequalities for the hilbert - schmidt distance and its modifications , which can be used for evaluating the `` degree of proximity '' between close quantum states .",
    "we have given new expressions for the hilbert - schmidt distance in terms of quasiprobability distributions and in terms of the ordered moments .",
    "we have constructed the distances which are sensitive to the energy of quantum states .",
    "these `` @xmath62-distances '' are unlimited and they distinguish different orthogonal states .",
    "besides , we have shown how the concept of distance can be introduced in the framework of the new `` classical - like '' formulation of quantum mechanics in terms of positive probability distributions of the rotated ( in the phase space ) quadrature operators .",
