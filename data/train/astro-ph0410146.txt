    "the earliest evolutionary phase of star formation , in which a deeply embedded protostar is known to exist , is the so - called class0 stage ( andr et al .",
    "1993 ) . since protostars in this phase ( class0 sources )",
    "are highly obscured by extended dusty envelopes , they can be observed mainly in the far - infrared to millimetre wavelength range .",
    "specifically , a class0 source consists of a central protostellar object surrounded by an infalling dusty envelope and a flattened accretion disk .",
    "many ( presumably all ) class0 sources are associated with strong molecular flows , usually more energetic than those from class1 sources ( davis & eislffel  1995 ) .",
    "since class0 sources will determine most of the early evolutionary history of the protostars as they evolve toward main - sequence stars , it is crucial to determine the physical conditions within the envelope of class0 objects .",
    "however , because of detection difficulty , constraining physical properties of class0 sources is a challenging task .",
    "nevertheless , continuum submillimetre observations of these sources let us to detect dust emission of the massive circumstellar envelopes , and provide a powerful tool for constraining the distribution of matter ( adams  1991 ) .",
    "independent methods of detection of class0 sources , and techniques and useful ways to help to the interpretation of properties of protostars have been developed and used during the last years ( e.g. comparation of submillimetre with near infrared surveys of a star forming region ( stanke et al .",
    "2000 ) , interpretation from the dust emission ( shirley et al .",
    "2000 ) , blackbody fitting ( chini et al .  2001 ) , radiative transfer codes ( wolf et al .",
    "1999 ) , evolutionary models for protostars ( smith  2002 ) ) . in this work",
    ", we combine them and develop an approach in order to constrain the structure ( geometry , radial intensity profile , spatial temperature , and spectral energy distributions ( seds ) ) , and physical properties ( mass , size , bolometric luminosity ( @xmath0 ) and temperature ( @xmath3 ) , and age ) of class0 sources .",
    "specifically , we combine the information from the dust emission with a physical model of the extended envelope , the implementation of techniques like the blackbody fitting and the 1d continuum self - consistent mc3d radiative transfer code ( by wolf et al .  1999 ) , and the smith evolutionary model for protostars ( by smith  2002 ) .    to describe and study stellar evolution , the hertzsprung -russell diagram ( hrd ) has become the main way .",
    "however , to study protostellar evolution , the @xmath3@xmath0 diagram ( bltd , bolometric luminosity - temperature diagram ) was proposed as direct analogue to the hrd ( myers & ladd  1993 ; myers et al .",
    "there , class0 sources are characterised by the lowest @xmath3 values of all protostars .",
    "although the bltd provides a useful way to study the evolution of protostars for all evolutionary phases of relevance for star formation ( myers et al .",
    "1998 ) , nevertheless , the smith scheme predicts the evolution of @xmath1 and @xmath0 as an envelope of initial mass @xmath5 and temperature @xmath6 dissipates on a timescale @xmath7 and forms a star .",
    "how can we describe the protostellar emission from the envelope ? in order to facilitate the interpretation of submillimetre observations , we adopt the standard envelope model ( adams  1991 ) to keep the problem as simple as possible .",
    "the circular symmetry of the observed emission ( see rengel  2004 ) , and the lack of significant internal structure justifies the simplicity of a spherical model case .",
    "if the emission is optically thin , the observed intensity for a spherically symmetric protostellar envelope at an impact parameter @xmath8 is given by eq.1 assuming a single power - law index of the opacity @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10\\rho(r)\\frac{r}{\\sqrt{r^{2}-b^{2}}}dr,\\ ] ]    @xmath11 is the outer radius , @xmath12 the density , @xmath13 the dust temperature , @xmath14 the opacity of the dust grains , and @xmath15 $ ] the planck function at dust temperature @xmath16 .",
    "the current theory suggests that the density and temperature distributions are power - law indices ( @xmath4 and @xmath17 , respectively , see e.g. adams  1991 ) . if the emission is in the rayleigh - jeans limit and if @xmath11@xmath18 @xmath8 , eq.1 can be approximated to @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 is the power - law index of the observed intensity profile , and @xmath21 is the normalization factor to the peak emission ) .",
    "to investigate the physical structure , processes , and properties of class0 sources , six star forming regions were observed in the perseus and orion molecular cloud complexes at 450 and 850  @xmath2 m with the submillimetre common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) camera at the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) on mauna kea , hawaii .",

    "+    from these continuum scuba maps , 36 submillimetre sources ( @xmath22 3@xmath23 ) are detected ( 26 in perseus and 10 in orion ) .",
    "some of them are extended , and many contain multiple condensations , as well as extended diffuse features .",
    "twelve objects are reported for the first time ( six in perseus and six in orion ) , and fifteen sources are analyzed here .",
    "additionally , the first detailed submillimetre observations of the two regions ngc1333 south and l1641n have been obtained and are discussed in rengel  ( 2004 ) , unveiling objects previously unknown .",
    "the survey also reveals a large number of small groups ( rengel et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "physical parameters like the dust submillimetre spectral index @xmath24 ( this value is related directly to the dust emissivity exponent @xmath9 by @xmath9=@xmath25 - 2 ) , gas and dust masses , and sizes of the envelopes are derived .",
    "the dust submillimetre spectral index @xmath26 is defined by    @xmath27    the mean value of @xmath24 for these objects is 2.8 @xmath28 0.4 , implying that the regions investigated here are quite cold ( @xmath2910k ) .",
    "such low dust temperatures have for example also been found for isolated globules in the perseus region ( see e.g. myers & benson  1983 ) , suggesting an exponent @xmath30 for the dust grain opacity , @xmath14 . the failure of the rayleigh - jeans approximation could increase the value of @xmath9 .",
    "an aspect ratio was defined for each of the sources by dividing the semi - major and minor axis lengths as measured typically at the 97% contour .",
    "we find that the observed aspect ratios of the protostellar emission maps lie in the range 1.0 - 2.0 with an average value of 1.3 @xmath28 0.1 , suggesting that the envelopes of class0 sources can be described approximately as spherically symmetric .",
    "nevertheless , a departure of this symmetry , i.e. , from an aspect ratio of 1 , in some cases is found .",
    "this mismatch could be produced by several factors like magnetic fields of energy densities sufficiently large to influence the object structure and cause flattening along field lines , the bipolar outflow , rapidly rotating structures , or high levels of angular momentum ( rengel  2004 ) .",
    "the average value of the gas and dust mass of the sample , based on the thermal emission from the dust according to hildebrand  ( 1983 ) , is 2.5 @xmath28 0.6 m@xmath31 ( typical aperture 45@xmath32 ) . in order to derive physical properties of the sources from the observed azimuthally",

    "if these data - points had correct flux measurements , the sources would exhibit an excess of mid - infrared emission which could be caused by ongoing outflow / dust interactions . because it is likely that these iras points are incorrect in some cases , further mid - infrared observations of these objects are necessary to investigate the nature of this possible excess .",
    "8) the assumption of spherical symmetry in the envelope model is reasonable .",
    "nevertheless , deviations from this geometry determined by comparations between observed and modeled seds at short wavelengths , and between observed and simulated radial profiles of relatively spherical class0 sources become extremely prominent .",
    "this discrepancy could be due to the exclusion of a non - spherical geometry , of cavities produced by molecular outflows , or of a flattened disk in the model ; it could also be due to specific assumptions considered here , e.g.a single point - like nature of the sources , and a constant dust opacity with radius in the model .",

    "detailed physical interpretation of the internal structure of nine observed class0 sources was carried out by intensive computer modelling . a simple spherically symmetric model envelope , and assumptions about density and dust distributions following the standard envelope model reproduced reasonably well the observed seds and the radial profiles of the sources .",
    "@xmath6(@xmath33 ) @xmath92 is a good approximation for the sample .",
    "the radial temperature distribution as function of distance , however , departed significantly from the optically - thin assumption , an observational derivation of a single - power law @xmath17 of 0.4 for radii @xmath36 10  au .",
