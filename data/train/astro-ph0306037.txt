    "damped lyman-@xmath0 ( dla ) systems represent the objects with the highest neutral gas content in the high - redshift universe ( @xmath1 ) and their ism shows traces of substantial chemical enrichment ( their metallicities can span from @xmath2 up to @xmath3 of the solar value , see prochaska , these proceedings ) . for these reasons ,",
    "dlas are believed to represent the progenitors of the present - day galaxies .",
    "the very high @xmath4 values allow very accurate abundance measurements for many low ionization species ( e.g. siii , feii , znii ) , thus dlas represent very helpful tools in the study of early galactic chemical evolution . in this paper , by means of detailed chemical evolution models for galaxies of different morphological types ( spirals , irregulars , ellipticals ) we aim at reconstructing the star formation history ( or histories ) which gave rise to the abundance patterns observed in dlas . in chemical evolution models absolute abundances usually depend on all the model assumptions , whereas the abundance ratios depend only on nucleosynthesis , stellar lifetimes and initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "abundance ratios can therefore be used as cosmic clocks if they involve two elements formed on quite different timescales , typical examples being [ @xmath0/fe ] and [ n/@xmath0 ] ratios .",
    "these ratios , when examined together with [ fe / h ] , or any other metallicity tracer such as [ zn / h ] , allow us to clarify the particular history of star formation involved , as shown by matteucci ( 2001 ) . in a regime of high star formation rate",
    "we expect to observe overabundances of @xmath0-elements for a large interval of [ fe / h ] , whereas the contrary is expected for a regime of low star formation .",
    "this is due to the different roles played by the supernovae ( sne ) of type ii relative to the sne of type ia .",
    "these latter , in fact , are believed to be responsible for the bulk of fe and fe - peak element production and occur on much longer timescales than sne ii , which are responsible for the production of the @xmath0-elements ( i.e. o , ne , mg , si , ca ) .",
    "for this reason , the analysis of the relative abundances can enable us to have important hints on the nature and age of the ( proto- ) galaxies which give rise to dla systems .",
    "a chemical evolution model ( see matteucci , these proceedings ) allows one to follow in detail the evolution of the abundances of several chemical species , starting from the matter reprocessed by the stars and restored into the ism through stellar winds and supernova explosions . according to our scheme , elliptical galaxies form as the result of a rapid collapse of a homogeneous sphere of primordial gas ( matteucci 1994 ) where star formation is taking place at the same time as the collapse proceeds , and evolve as `` closed - boxes '' , i.e. without any interaction with the external environment .",
    "the model for the spiral is calibrated on the chemical features of the milky - way ( mw , chiappini et al .",
    "it is assumed to form as a result of two main infall episodes ( chiappini et al .",
    "1997 ) . during the first episode the halo forms and the gas shed by the halo rapidly gathers in the center leading to the formation of the bulge . during the second episode ,",
    "a slower infall of external gas gives rise to the disk with the gas accumulating faster in the inner than in the outer region ( `` inside - out '' scenario , matteucci & franois , 1989 ) .",
    "irregular galaxies are assumed to form owing to a continuous infall of pristine gas , until a mass of @xmath6 is accumulated .",
    "the star formation rate can proceed either in bursts separated by long quiescent periods or at a low regime but continuously .",
    "the nucleosynthesis prescriptions are common to all the models and include : the yields of thielemann , nomoto & hashimoto ( 1996 ) for massive stars ( m @xmath7 ) , the yields of van den hoeck & groenewegen ( 1997 ) for low and intermediate mass stars ( @xmath8 ) and the yields of nomoto et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for type ia sne . for the evolution of zn and ni we adopted the nucleosynthesis prescriptions of matteucci et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , where the yields of both elements are assumed to scale as the fe ones in both ia and ii supernovae .",
    "such an assumption provides a satisfactory fit to the [ zn / fe ] and [ ni / fe ] vs [ fe / h ] patterns observed in galactic stars in the solar neighbourhood ( calura et al .",
    "we assume a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf for irregular / starburst and elliptical galaxies , and a scalo ( 1986 ) for spirals .",
    "zn is a very reliable metallicity indicator since , unlike fe , it is not affected by dust depletion ( savage & sembach 1996 ) , hence its measured abundances do not need dust corrections .",
    "figure 1.1 shows the evolution of the [ zn / h ] ratio versus redshift for galaxies of different morphological types , compared to the values measured in dlas by various authors .",
    "we assume a standard @xmath9cdm cosmology ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) and for the sake of simplicity the same formation redshift for all galaxies ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "though this represents a rather unrealistic picture , since it is unlikely that all dla systems started forming stars at the same epoch , this figure provides clear indications on which systems can represent possible dla candidates and which can not .",
    "in fact , the metallicity levels reached by ellipticals are in general considerably higher than the ones observed in dlas . on the other hand ,",
    "all the points lie in the regions spanned by the spiral models , whose [ zn / h ] values are in general undersolar in the external regions and become slightly oversolar in the most internal ones , and the irregular model , whose low star formation rate produces metallicities very similar to the ones of the spiral outskirts .",
    "the conclusion is that the dla population is heterogeneous , possibly composed by large disk galaxies observed at different galactocentric distances , and small irregular systems .",
    "the presence of dust in dlas ( which is indicated by several clues such as the reddening of qsos in presence of dlas along the line of sight , see fall and pei 1995 ) represents a complication in chemical evolution studies , since its effect is to deplete some chemical elements ( e. g. fe , si ) more than others ( o , zn ) thus altering the observed abundances .",
    "in order to face this effect , the observations need reliable corrections for dust depletion .",
    "figure 1.2 shows the [ si / fe ] distribution versus redshift ( upper panels ) and [ fe / h ] ( lower panels ) , as predicted by models of galaxies of different morphological types and compared with uncorrected ( left panels ) dla data and corrected ( right panels ) for dust depletion according to vladilo ( 2002 ) .",
    "we notice that , without dust correction , the majority of the observed systems shows strong signs of si enhancement , being the data in the [ si / fe ] vs [ fe / h ] plot more consistent with an elliptical abundance pattern than with a spiral or irregular one .",
    "once we apply the dust corrections to the data , the enhancement observed in all the systems is considerably reduced or vanished and all the points become fairly consistent with the spiral and irregular curves .",
    "this result is confirmed by the study of the abundance ratios between elements not affected by dust depletion , e.g. s and zn , as is shown in figure 1.3 .",
    "for the few systems considered in this set of data ( centurion et al . 2003 ) , only one object ( dla0347 - 383 , levshakov et al .",
    "2001 ) out of eight is consistent with the prediction for an elliptical galaxy , whereas another dla system ( dla0013 - 004 , centurin et al .",
    "2000 ) has a [ s / zn ] value lower than the predictions of all the models considered here , but the majority of the points is reproduced either by models of spirals and irregulars .",
    "this is another clear indication that , once the dust corrections are taken into account , elliptical galaxies ( and big spheroids in general ) can not explain the abundance ratios observed in dlas .",
    "vs redshift ( upper panels ) and [ fe / h ] ( lower panels ) observed in dlas ( see calura et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) and compared to chemical evolution models in the case of data not corrected ( left panels ) and corrected ( right panels ) for dust depletion .",
    "the models are the same as in figure 1.1.,width=377,height=377 ]          n is expected to be restored into the ism after each @xmath0 element , with a time delay depending on the lifetimes of its stellar progenitors . in particular , n is mainly produced in low and intermediate mass stars which start dying after @xmath13 yr since the beginning of star formation .",
    "the bulk of n production occurs after @xmath14 myr ( henry et al .",
    "2000 ; chiappini et al .",
    "for this reason , the [ n/@xmath0 ] ratio is an important chemical evolution diagnostic and can provide useful information on the age of dlas . in figure 1.4 we show the predicted [ n / si ] vs [ si / h ] and the values measured in dlas by various authors ( see calura et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) . unlike in the previous figures",
    ", here we do not show the curve for ellipticals since it would lie at [ @xmath0/h ] values much higher than the ones observed in this sample of data .",
    "there have been recent claims for a bimodal distribution of the [ n / si ] vs [ si / h ] values observed in dlas , with a plateau located at [ n / si ] @xmath15 including a very small set of objects , and the majority of the systems with [ n / si ] @xmath16 ( prochaska , these proeedings ; molaro , these proceedings ) .",
    "further observations are needed to investigate whether the data missing between the lower plateau and the bulk of the systems is real or due only to a small number of objects with available n measures .",
    "+ however , from figure 1.4 it is clear that spiral and irregular models can again fairly well reproduce the [ n/@xmath0 ] values observed in this sample of dlas .    .",
