    "systems of interacting oscillators are ubiquitous in science . in the common case where the natural frequencies or amplitudes or inter - oscillator couplings are time - varying , they pose a continuing challenge to the time - series analyst who endeavours to understand the underlying system from the signal(s ) it creates",
    ". oversimplifications of hypotheses are often used to render the problem more tractable , but can all too easily result in a failure to describe phenomena that are in fact of central importance  given that the strength , direction and functional relationships that define the nature of the interactions can cause qualitatively new states to appear or disappear .",
    "time - variability of this kind is especially important in biological applications , though it is by no means restricted to biology .    in the absence of time - variability",
    ", there are many different methods available @xcite for detecting and quantifying the couplings and directionality ( dominant direction of influence ) between oscillators based , especially , on the analysis of phase dynamics .",
    "approaches to the detection of synchronization have mostly been based on the statistical properties of the phase difference @xcite .",
    "the inference of an underlying phase model has been used as the functional basis for a number of techniques to infer the nature of the phase - resetting curves , interactions and structures of networks @xcite . however , these techniques inferred neither the noise dynamics nor the parameters characterizing the noise .",
    "an additional challenge to these methods can be the time - varying dynamics mentioned above . in a separate line of development , bayesian inference was applied to analyse the system dynamics @xcite , thereby opening the door to inference of noisy time - evolving phase dynamics .",
    "methods based on transfer entropy and granger causality have a generality that has facilitated a number of applications , including inference of the coupling strength and directionality @xcite .",
    "these techniques provide measures of the amount of information in a measured signal , or the causal relationships between measured signals and , in doing so , they infer effect rather than mechanism .    in this paper",
    "we describe in detail and further extend a recently introduced method @xcite based on dynamical bayesian inference .",
    "as we demonstrate below , it enjoys many advantages over earlier approaches .",
    "one of these is that it does not require the observable to fill the domain of the probability density function at equilibrium : it can thus provide the same information from a small fraction of the data that is required by the transfer entropy or granger causality approaches .",
    "additionally , the dynamical approach has the advantage of characterizing the system completely ( not only in terms of information measures ) .",
    "thus , from the inferred dynamics one can deduce self - consistently any information that is of interest , be it coupling functions , or synchronization , or causality , or equilibrium densities , including the equations of motion .",
    "we discuss in detail the theoretical background , the technical aspects and limitations of the algorithms , and we demonstrate the wide applicability of the method by consideration of several examples .",
    "the coupling functions are of particular importance .",
    "their form is uniquely able to describe the functional laws of interaction between the oscillators .",
    "earlier theoretical studies have included the work of kuramoto @xcite and winfree @xcite , which used a function defined either by the phase difference or by both phases , and of daido @xcite and crawford @xcite who used a more general form in which the coupling function was expanded in fourier series .",
    "other methods for inference of the coupling functions have also been suggested @xcite .",
    "the technique described below goes beyond all of these because it is able to follow the time - variability of the coupling functions and hence can reveal their dynamical character where it exists .",
    "we will also show how the technique can readily be extended to encompass networks of interacting oscillators .",
    "these form a large and important group of physical systems , including neural networks @xcite , electrochemical systems @xcite , crowd synchrony on the millennium bridge , and networks of fireflies @xcite .",
    "the large scale of the networks can introduce a higher complexity , both in structure and functional behavior .",
    "for example in neuronal networks , the existence of spatial and spatial - temporal correlations , collective or partially collective ( clustering ) behavior , synchronization or desynchronization , and time - variability has been reported    @xcite . in such cases , and given the kinds of phenomenon to be studied , there is an increasing need for powerful techniques that can infer the time - varying dynamics of the oscillatory networks .    in sec .",

    "such an oscillator can usually be represented by a constant phase velocity @xmath3 and a vector coordinate that defines the limit cycle as a function of the phase @xmath4 : @xmath5 .    when two such oscillators mutually interact sufficiently weakly , their motion is commonly approximated just by their phase dynamics @xcite .",

    "2 .   inference , given the data , of the fourier terms , the noise amplitude , and their correlation in form of a parameter probability distribution ( see sec .",

    "( [ eq : phif ] ) we make extensive use of the approach to dynamical inference presented in @xcite . in this section",
    "we briefly outline the technique as adapted to the present case .",
    "the fundamental problem in dynamical inference can be defined as follows . a @xmath20-dimensional ( in general @xmath21-dimensional ) time - series of observational data @xmath22 ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 )",
    "is provided , and the unknown model parameters @xmath25 are to be inferred .",

    "function @xmath27 , the probability density to observe @xmath28 given the choice @xmath29 of the dynamical model .",
    "bayes theorem @xmath30 then enables calculation of the so - called _ posterior _ density @xmath31 of the unknown parameters @xmath32 conditioned on the observations .    for independent white gaussian noise sources , and in the mid - point approximation",
    "where @xmath33 the likelihood is given by a product over @xmath34 of the probability of observing @xmath35 at each time .",
    "the likelihood function is constructed by evaluation of the stochastic integral of the noise term over time , as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the cholesky decomposition of the positive definite matrix @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is a vector of normally - distributed random variables with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "the joint probability density of @xmath39 is used to find the joint probability density of the process in respect of @xmath40 by imposing @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the jacobian term of the transformation of variables that can be calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fourierdecomposition ] ) .",
    "if the sampling frequency is high enough , the time step @xmath43 tends to zero , and the determinant of the jacobian @xmath42 can be well - approximated by the product of its diagonal terms @xmath44 this transformation leads to an extra term in a least squares likelihood , and the minus log - likelihood function @xmath45 can thus be written as @xmath46 { ( { e}^{-1})}_{ij }   [ \\dot{\\phi}_{j , n } - c^{(j)}_k { \\phi}_{j , k}({\\phi}_{\\cdot , n}^{\\ast } ) ] \\big ) \\ , , \\end{split }      \\label{eq : likelihood}\\ ] ] where summation over the repeated indices @xmath47,@xmath48,@xmath49,@xmath50 is implicit .",
    "the log - likelihood ( [ eq : likelihood ] ) is a quadratic form of the fourier coefficients of the phases . hence if a multivariate prior probability is assumed , the posterior probability is a multivariate normal distribution as well .",
    "this is highly desirable for two reasons : ( i ) a gaussian posterior is computationally convenient because it guarantees a unique maximum , with the mean vector and covariance matrix completely characterizing the distribution and giving us the most significant information ; ( ii ) all the multivariate normal posteriors can be used again as priors in the presence of a new block of data , and knowledge about the system can easily be updated .",
    "this last feature is essential for any real - time application because it ensures that the complexity of the algorithm does not change with the length of the input data - stream .    from @xcite , and assuming a multivariate normal distribution as the prior for parameters @xmath51 , with means @xmath52 , and covariances @xmath53 , the stationary point of @xmath54",
    "can be calculated recursively from @xmath55 where the covariance is @xmath56 , summation over @xmath34 from 1 to @xmath0 is assumed and summation over repeated indices @xmath47,@xmath48,@xmath49,@xmath50,@xmath57 is again implicit .",
    "we note that a noninformative `` flat '' prior can be used as the limit of an infinitely large normal distribution , by setting @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the multivariate probability @xmath60 given the readout time series @xmath22 explicitly defines the probability density of each parameter set of the dynamical system .",
    "because each of them can be discriminated , as belonging or not belonging to the arnold tongue region we can define the binary property @xmath61 , and can obtain the posterior probability of the system being synchronized or not by evaluating the probability of @xmath62 @xmath63 the computation of @xmath64 will be discussed in sec . [",
    "sc : synchdetection ] .      the multivariate probability described by @xmath65 for the given time series @xmath66 explicitly defines the probability density of each parameter set of the dynamical system .",
    "when the sequential data come from a stream of measurements providing multiple blocks of information , one applies ( [ eq : cd ] ) to each block . within the bayesian theorem ,",
    "the evaluation of the current distribution relies on the evaluation of the previous block of data , i.e.  the current prior depends on the previous posterior .",
    "thus the inference defined in this way is not a simple windowing , but each stationary posterior depends on the history of the evaluations from previous blocks of data .    in classical bayesian inference ,",
    "if the system is known to be non - time - varying , then the posterior density of each block is taken as the prior of the next one : @xmath67 .",
    "this full propagation of the covariance matrix allows good separation of the noise , and the uncertainties in the parameters steadily decrease with time as more data are included .",
    "if time - variability exists , however , this propagation will act as a strong constraint on the inference , which will then fail to follow the variations of the parameters .",
    "this situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1:tv_propg](a ) .",

    "[ sc : applications ] .",
    "] in such cases , one can consider the processes between each block of data to be independent ( i.e.  markovian ) .",
    "there can not then be any information propagation between the blocks of data , and each inference starts from the flat distribution @xmath68 .",
    "the inference can thus follow more closely the time - variability of the parameters , but the effect of noise and the uncertainty of the inference will of course be much larger , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1:tv_propg](b ) .    where the system s parameters are time - dependent",
    ", we may assume that their probability diffuses normally accordingly to the known diffusion matrix @xmath69 .",
    "thus , the probability density of the parameters is the convolution of the two normal multivariate distributions , @xmath70 and @xmath69 @xmath71 the covariance matrix @xmath69 expresses our belief about which part of the dynamical fields that define the oscillators has changed , and the extent of that change .",
    "its elements are ( @xmath72 = @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the standard deviation of the diffusion of the parameter @xmath75 after the time window @xmath76 that has elapsed from the first block of information to the following one .",

    "a special example of @xmath69 will be considered : we assume that there is no correlation between parameters , i.e.  @xmath80 , and that each standard deviation @xmath74 is a known fraction of the parameter @xmath75 : @xmath81 ( where @xmath82 indicates that @xmath83 is referred to a window of length @xmath76 ) .",
    "it is important to note that this particular example is actually rather general because it assumes that all of the parameters ( from the @xmath84 diagonal ) can be of a time - varying nature  which corresponds to the inference of real ( experimental ) systems with",
    "_ a priori _ unknown time - variability .",
    "there are two obvious limits in modeling the knowledge assumed with respect to possible time variation of parameters .",
    "the first of these is to assume no time - variability : in this case the full information propagation matrix is used , @xmath85 .",
    "if the assumption proves wrong , the inferred parameters may accumulate a bias when the real system varies in time .",
    "the other limit is to assume each time window to be completely independent of the previous signal history . in this case",
    "no propagation is used , @xmath86 , ( i.e.  @xmath87 ) , and there is no bias but , because much information is forgotten , the probability of the inferred parameters has a large covariance matrix .",
    "an optimal assumption must lies in between these two limits : @xmath88 ; where the choice of @xmath89 is parameterized with the values of the @xmath82 s .",
    "if a diffusion matrix is assumed , we allow the method some freedom for the time - variability to be followed , while restricting it to be unbiased .",

    "[ fig1:tv_propg](c ) demonstrates that the time - variability is captured correctly and that the uncertainty is reduced because more data have been included .",

    "this selective propagation can be achieved if , for example , not all but only the selected correlation @xmath91 from the diagonal has a non - zero value .",
    "it is important to note that finite noise can induce phase slips in a system that would be synchronized in the noiseless limit . rather than focusing on the presence and statistics of phase - slips , we propose to detect synchronization from the nature of the phase - slip itself .",
    "a novel feature of the present study is that it proposes evaluation of the probability that the equations driving the dynamics are _ intrinsically _ synchronized and thus of whether any phase - slips that may possibly be observed are dynamics - related or noise - induced .    after performing the inference",

    "such selection is optional , but it provides an effective means by which to incorporate previous knowledge available for any particular system , and enables the algorithm to adapt itself optimally to the externally - imposed constraints .    given the advantages that the dynamical approach offers in tackling synchronization detection and coupling identification , we believe that the framework presented above will be found valuable for a wide range of future applications .",
    "the procedure of synchronization detection between two oscillators generating phase time - series reduces to the investigation of synchronization of the synthetic phase model using the parameters returned by the bayesian algorithm . to calculate @xmath267 for any of the sampled parameter sets",
    ", one can proceed as follows :    * from an arbitrary fixed @xmath268 , and for an arbitrary @xmath269 , integrate numerically ( using the standard fourth - order runge - kutta algorithm ) the dynamical system prescribed by the phase base function ( eq .  ( [ eq : phif ] ) without the noise ) for one cycle of the toroidal coordinate , obtaining the mapped point @xmath270 .",
    "* repeat the same integration for multiple @xmath271 coordinates next to the initial one , obtaining the map @xmath272 * based on finite difference evaluation of @xmath273 , use a modified version of newton s root - finding method to analyse the function @xmath274 .",
    "the method is modified by calculating @xmath96 at the next point @xmath116 such that @xmath275 the coefficient @xmath276 is an arbitrary constant that we found to be particularly efficient for solution of the problem .",
    "note that in this version , newton s method can only test the function by moving forward ; in actual fact ( a ) the existence of the root is not guaranteed ; and ( b ) we are not interested in the root itself but only in its existence .",
    "* if there is a root , @xmath203 is returned .",
    "if a root is not found , @xmath277 is returned .",
    "in order to infer the phase dynamics , one needs to have good estimates of the phases from the observable time - series .",
    "this is even more important when the oscillatory dynamics is time - varying and the analysis requires instantaneous phases .",
    "potential difficulties for phase estimation arise when the signals emanate from complex , highly nonlinear and/or mixed - mode oscillatory dynamics .",
    "although the phase from the respiration signal is relatively easy to detect , obtaining the instantaneous phase from the ecg signal is considerably more difficult .",
    "we used the synchrosqueezed wavelet transform @xcite to estimate phases from the complex and nonlinear ecg and respiration signals . given a signal @xmath278 we first calculate its wavelet transform in the scale - time domain @xmath279 , @xmath280 where the @xmath281 represents the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet @xmath282 @xmath283 we use the morlet mother wavelet @xmath284{\\pi}}\\text { } e^{-i 2\\pi f_0 u}\\cdot e^{-u^2/2 } , \\nonumber \\label{equ : wavelet}\\ ] ] where the central frequency was set to be @xmath285 .",
    "the synchrosqueezed transform aims to `` squeeze '' the wavelet around the intrinsic frequency in order to provide better frequency localization . for any @xmath279 for which @xmath286 , a candidate instantaneous frequency for the signal @xmath287 can be calculated as @xmath288 the information from the time - scale plane",
    "is transferred to the time - frequency plane , according to a map @xmath289 , in an operation called synchrosqueezing .",
    "the synchrosqueezed wavelet transform is then expressed as @xmath290 where @xmath291 , and @xmath292 is as defined in ( [ equ : freq ] ) above , for @xmath293 such that @xmath294 .",
    "the complex ( as with real and imaginary values ) nature of the synchrosqueezed transform allows one to extract the phase of the signal as the angle of the transform @xmath295.\\ ] ] the transform s great advantage lies in its ability to determine instantaneous characteristics from complex signals with non - harmonic waveforms .",
    "evaluated through such a procedure the phases @xmath296 may , however , be observable - dependent and non - universal , i.e.  they can retain premises resulting from the phase - detection technique ( in this case the synchrosqueezed transform ) but not from the genuine phases .",
    "they are therefore treated as protophases , and a special technique is applied to transform the protophases into true phases @xmath297 that are independent of the observable and are universally defined @xcite .",
    "the transformation can be written as @xmath298 where @xmath299 are coefficients from a fourier expansion of the averaged phase relationships .",
    "for further detail see @xcite .",
    "for a sufficiently large number of parameters @xmath96 , the complexity of the algorithm for parameter estimation is substantially dominated by o@xmath300 , which is of the order of the time required for an @xmath96-sized matrix inversion . for a network of @xmath0 oscillators , if one consider all possible pairwise connections then @xmath301 , where @xmath302 is a proportionality coefficient to account for by the truncation order of the fourier decomposition .",
    "similarly , if one considers all pairwise connections and every double connection up to a truncation order of @xmath303 , then @xmath304 . with recursive reasoning ,",
    "if one considers all the @xmath47-tuples with @xmath47 up to @xmath305 , each with a truncation order of @xmath306 , then the number of coefficients would grow as @xmath307 it is clear that even for a modest network , considering just a few @xmath47-tuples of possible connections would be unfeasible in practice .",
    "very careful selection of the base functions is therefore always to be recommended ."
