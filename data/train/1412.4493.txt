    "nucleus - nucleus collisions at the beam kinetic energies of 1 - 2a gev offer the unique possibility to study the onset of the strangeness production .",
    "the emergence of strangeness at beam energies below the thresholds in free nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) collisions is facilitated by the appearance of resonances and mesons in the heated ( t @xmath4  mev ) and compressed ( 2 - 3 times above the normal nuclear density @xmath5 ) collision zone , where the basic properties of particles like effective mass and decay constant are modified  @xcite .",
    "the knowledge about the emission yields and kinematical properties of @xmath0 mesons produced in nucleus - nucleus collisions is very limited at the beam energy below 10a gev as the experimental data is scarce in this beam energy region  @xcite .",
    "possible channels of in - medium @xmath0 meson production include bb  @xmath6  bb@xmath0 , mb  @xmath6  n@xmath0 , @xmath7 ( b = [ n ,  @xmath8 , m = [ @xmath9 ,  @xmath10 ) .",
    "calculations within the buu transport model for the central ni+ni collisions at the beam energy of 1.93a gev favour the dominance of the mb channels  @xcite .",
    "this system was measured in a previous work by the fopi collaboration , but the statistics ( 23@xmath117 events attributed to @xmath12 mesons ) was insufficient for a quantitative comparison with the calculations  @xcite .",
    "since the mean decay path of @xmath0 is 46  fm , most of these particles decay outside the collision zone . as its dominant decay channel",
    "is @xmath13 ( br = 48.9% )  @xcite , and the freeze - out yields of @xmath0 and k@xmath1 are found to be of comparable order  @xcite , @xmath0 decays are the source of k@xmath1 mesons that are mostly unaffected by presence inside the medium , in contrast to those negative kaons produced directly in the collision zone .",
    "therefore , evaluation of the @xmath0/k@xmath1 ratio is of importance for the studies of the modifications of k@xmath1 properties in - medium . in the discussed energy range",
    "this ratio was reported for the ar+kcl collisions at 1.756a gev  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present the yield and kinetic energy distribution of @xmath0 , as well as the @xmath0/k@xmath1 ratio for the collisions of ni+ni at the beam kinetic energy of 1.91a gev , covering the most central 51% of the geometrical cross section .",
    "the experiment was carried out with the fopi spectrometer , installed at the heavy - ion synchrotron sis-18 in gsi , darmstadt .",
    "the innermost detector is the azimuthally symmetric central drift chamber ( cdc ) , covering the wide range of polar angles ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "cdc is surrounded by two detectors in the barrel geometry , dedicated for the time - of - flight ( tof ) measurements : multi - strip multi - gap resistive plate counter  @xcite , spanning @xmath15 , and the plastic scintillation barrel ( psb ) , covering @xmath16 .",
    "these devices are encircled by the magnet solenoid , delivering the magnetic field of b = 0.617  t , and covered at front by the plastic scintillation wall ( plawa ) .",
    "more details on characteristics and performance of the fopi apparatus can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath17ni ions , accelerated to the kinetic energy of 1.91a gev , were incident on the 405  @xmath18m - thick @xmath17ni target ( corresponding to 1% interaction probability ) . by requiring the multiplicities of charged hits in plawa ( psb ) to be @xmath19  5 ( @xmath19  1 ) , the trigger selected the sample of @xmath20 central and semi - central events amounting to 51% of the total geometrical cross section . assuming the simple geometrical model of interpenetrating spheres , and the sharp cut - off approximation between the maximum impact parameter and the total reaction cross section , the mean number of participant nucleons averaged over the impact parameter was estimated to be @xmath21 .",
    "particles traversing the cdc detector activate sense wires along their flight path , leaving series of _ hits _ , which are collected into _ tracks _ by the off - line procedure .",
    "while hitting the mmrpc ( psb ) detector , particles activate one or a few neighbouring strips , merged off - line into hits .",
    "subsequently , tracks in the cdc and hits in the tof detectors are matched .",
    "a collection of tracks is used to calculate the position @xmath22 of the event vertex . to reject the collisions occurred outside the target",
    ", a cut was applied on the component of the vertex position in the beam direction : @xmath23  cm .    in order to select a sample of good - quality tracks ,",
    "a set of cuts was applied . to suppress the contribution from the discontinuous tracks , the track was required to be constructed of at least 36 ( 32 ) hits for k@xmath1 ( k@xmath3 ) .",
    "the asymmetry in the number of hits is due to the non - radial profile of sense wires of the cdc , so the negative particles generate more hits on average than the positive ones .",
    "as both charged kaons are produced in the target , two more conditions were imposed on transverse and longitudinal distance of closest approach between the track and the collision vertex : @xmath24  cm and @xmath25  cm , accordingly .",
    "particles with the absolute values of charge higher than the elementary charge were rejected . since some anisotropy was found in the azimuthal distribution of tracks in the backward zone of the cdc , the region of @xmath26",
    "was excluded from the analysis .",
    "the requirement of cdc - tof matching imposes a lower limit on the transverse momentum of a particle spiralling in the magnetic field : @xmath27  gev / c .",
    "to ensure the good matching between the track in the cdc device and the hit in a tof detector , two additional conditions were imposed on the azimuthal and longitudinal distance between the extrapolation of the cdc track to the relevant tof module , and the hit therein : @xmath28 , @xmath29  cm for the psb , and @xmath30 , @xmath31  cm for the mmrpc .",

    "basing on the observation of signal and background ratio the high @xmath33 limits were imposed of 0.57 gev/@xmath34 ( mmrpc ) and 0.35 gev/@xmath34 ( psb ) . to reconstruct the phase space population of k@xmath1 ,",
    "the experimental mass distribution was analysed for every @xmath33-@xmath35 cell , where @xmath35 denotes rapidity in the laboratory frame , and the kaonic signal was separated from the background composed of @xmath36 mesons .",

    "to minimize the side effects on the edges of tof detectors , the observation region of the @xmath0 meson phase space was trimmed to @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the polar emission angle in the nucleon - nucleon centre of mass frame .",

    "after subtraction of the background , about 170 @xmath0 mesons were found under the peak . within the range of @xmath112 standard deviations of the fitted gaussian distribution the signal to background ratio was found to be 1.1 , and significance 9.3 .",
    "the values of cut parameters leading to the identification of @xmath0 mesons were further varied , and the propagation of these changes on the results were included in their systematic uncertainties .",

    "negative kaons were generated according to the homogeneous distribution , and embedded in the events of products of the ni+ni collisions at the beam energy of 1.91a gev , simulated by the iqmd code  @xcite .",
    "for both k@xmath1 and @xmath0 mesons , the simulated events were treated using the same off - line analysis package , as for the experimental data .",

    "a drop of efficiency at lower @xmath33 is caused by the higher probability for the kaon to decay on its path to either of two tof detectors .",
    "for the efficiency evaluation , the mass of the @xmath0 mesons was sampled from the breit - wigner distribution , and the phase space was populated by pulling from the boltzmann distribution scaled by the anisotropy term @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the temperature of the source , and @xmath43 is the anisotropy parameter .",
    "sampled mesons were subsequently boosted to the laboratory frame .",

    "@xcite , the phenomenological study of the internal efficiency of this detector was performed . while the effects of geometry and matching are the regular part of the geant - based efficiency determination procedure , possible internal mmrpc inefficiencies were not included so far .",
    "this additional efficiency factor was pursued by constructing first the ratio of cdc tracks with associated hit in a tof ( mmrpc , psb ) detector to all the reconstructed cdc tracks .",

    "a correction of the distributions of k mesons was done on an event - by - event basis by weighting every kaon event with the factor . in order to minimize the possible sensitivity of @xmath48 to particle s charge",
    ", corrections for negatively charged kaons were performed using the map obtained from @xmath36 mesons .",
    "differences between maps obtained from protons , and @xmath36 were found to be small ( in the order of 5 - 7% ) and were manifested mainly in the global normalization .",
    "the transverse momentum spectra for consecutive slices of rapidity within the @xmath53 range , covered by the mmrpc , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kmphase]a .",
    "they were fitted according to the boltzmann - like function :    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the transverse mass , and for every slice @xmath56 denotes the average value of rapidity in the nn frame , @xmath57 is the normalization factor , and @xmath58 is the inverse slope ( also called the apparent temperature ) .",
    "the @xmath33 spectra measured in the psb region ( @xmath59 ) had too poor statistics for the two - parameter fitting .",
    "therefore , the normalization parameters were extracted only , by fitting the formula [ eq : ptfit ] with one of two fixed values of @xmath58 : 45 and 60  mev ( differences in the results were accounted for in the evaluation of the systematic errors ) .",
    "the points of the rapidity distribution were obtained by an analytic integration of the formula [ eq : ptfit ] from 0 to @xmath60 for every slice ,    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the particle s mass , and substituting the parameters obtained in the fit above . the obtained distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kmphase]b . note , that the n and t@xmath63 fit parameters are typically characterized by the strong anticorrelation term in the covariance matrix , which was included in the error evaluation of the rapidity distribution.the magenta boxes on the abovementioned plot correspond to the systematic errors arising from variations of all the applied cuts and binnings , except for the contribution from the choice of binning of the rapidity axis .",
    "benefitting from the symmetry of the colliding system , the measured data points were reflected with respect to the midrapidity ( y@xmath64 ) , which allowed for a wide coverage of the k@xmath1 rapidity spectrum .    in order to obtain the k@xmath1 yield , the tails of the rapidity distribution",
    "were extrapolated . to assess the systematic error of this procedure ,",

    "the total yield of k@xmath1 was found to be :    @xmath66    per triggered event .",
    "note , that the relatively wide coverage of phase space allowed to minimize the assumptions on the overall shape profile of the rapidity distribution , and in consequence on the total yield of k@xmath1 .",
    "the limitation of the sample of @xmath0 mesons to about 170 events does not permit for a full - fledged analysis of its phase space , and thus for the reconstruction of the yield in a model - independent fashion .",
    "as a first step the yield was reconstructed directly by dividing the total number of events within the phase space region reported above by the inclusive efficiency for this region .",
    "however , the result revealed a clear correlation with the input temperature @xmath42 of the source simulated in the efficiency evaluation procedure ( cf .",
    "[ eq : phigeantmodel ] ) .",
    "it ranged between @xmath67 for @xmath68  mev , and @xmath69 for @xmath70  mev , not accounting for any statistical or systematic errors .",
    "this uncertainty was a motivation to study the kinetic energy spectrum of @xmath0 mesons , in hope that , apart from carrying the kinematical information itself , it may provide constraints on the temperature , and thus limit the uncertainty of the total yield .",
    "the reconstructed kinetic energy spectrum , was fitted with the boltzmann - like function of the form    ( color online ) kinetic energy distribution of @xmath0 mesons fitted with boltzmann - like function , assuming the following input parameters to the efficiency calculation : @xmath46  mev , @xmath47 ( see text for details).,width=325 ]    @xmath71    where @xmath57 is the normalization parameter , total energy @xmath72 , momentum @xmath73 , and @xmath74 is called the inverse slope .",
    "an exemplary case of fitting the kinetic energy spectrum at @xmath46  mev , @xmath47 , and events grouped in four bins , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phiekin ] .",
    "the extracted value of @xmath74 was found to depend a little on a choice of binning of the @xmath75 spectrum , @xmath42 and @xmath43 efficiency input parameters , particle identification cuts , and fit range imposed .",
    "however , only the fits obtained with the input @xmath42 around the middle of the probed range of @xmath76~mev}$ ] resulted in values of @xmath74 fit parameter consistent with @xmath42 . following this finding ,",
    "a self - consistency condition was imposed : @xmath77  mev , where 15  mev is the typical statistical error of the fitted @xmath74 .",
    "note , that this condition not only narrows down the ranges of input @xmath42 parameter , and the systematic error of @xmath74 , but the selection of the @xmath42 region also limits the systematic error of the total @xmath0-meson yield discussed above . within the imposed condition , the inverse slope of the kinetic energy distribution of @xmath0 mesons was found to be @xmath78 .",
    "the total yield was extracted by extrapolation of the data points with the fitted curve ( eq .",
    "[ eq : ekfit ] ) , and found to be    @xmath79    per triggered event .",
    "we found , that the impact of non - zero anisotropy parameter @xmath43 on the final results is on the level of 5% of this value .",
    "the nearly 50% branching ratio of the @xmath80 decay channel , and the comparable yields of @xmath0 and k@xmath1 mesons suggest that their emission should be considerably correlated .",
    "however , while direct k@xmath1 are emitted from the hot collision zone , most decay products of @xmath0 mesons are created outside this region .",
    "therefore , one may expect that negative kaons emitted from both these sources could have different kinematical characteristics .",
    "hence , the question arises , what fraction of the observed k@xmath1 originate from the decays of @xmath0 mesons .",
    "for this analysis we find the following ratio of yields :    @xmath81    where the systematic errors were obtained by combining all the variations of both components due to their own systematic uncertainties , and rejecting 5% of values on the tails of the resulting distribution .",
    "taking into account that 48.9% @xmath0 mesons decay into k@xmath3k@xmath1 pairs , it translates into @xmath82 of observed k@xmath1 originating from decays of @xmath0 mesons .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that the same values within errors have been obtained for the ar+kcl system colliding at even more subthreshold beam energy of 1.756a gev  @xcite .",
    "also , for the central al+al collisions at 1.9a gev , a similar value of @xmath83 was found  @xcite . however , for the elementary pp collisions at 2.7 gev , this ratio was found to be slightly above 1  @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation of this discrepancy arises in the context of the statistical model where the volume of open strangeness production is assumed to be limited and parametrized by the canonical radius @xmath84 .",
    "according to the calculations reported in  @xcite , the @xmath0/ k@xmath1 ratio measured for ar+kcl is consistent with @xmath84 between 2.2 and 3.2 fm , while that for pp is reproduced for @xmath85  fm , although the latter prediction disagrees with the experimental data at higher beam energies .",
    "unfortunately , performing the statistical model fit to the data was not possible for the present experiment , due to a meager amount of reconstructed particle yields available at centralities corresponding to @xmath21 .",
    "much wider array of particle yields is available for the central collisions of the studied system ( c.f .",

    "the temperature parameter ( inverse slope ) of kaons from the @xmath0-meson decays was fixed at a value obtained from the simulation described above , while the slope for the direct kaons was extracted by fitting the two - source model to the experimental data , giving the results shown in open circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : kaon2src ] . keeping in mind the limited statistics , and simplicity of the model ,",
