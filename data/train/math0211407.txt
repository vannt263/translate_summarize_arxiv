    "we state the following conjecture and note that it was proved to be true by morimoto , for the special class of knots which do not contain essential meridional surfaces , also known as _ smallish knots _ ( see [ mo3 ] ) :    the knots @xmath13 and @xmath14 satisfy the inequality @xmath15 if and only if either @xmath16 or @xmath17 , say @xmath16 , has a minimal genus heegaard splitting @xmath0 in which @xmath18 and a meridian curve @xmath19 is isotopic to a curve @xmath20 on the heegaard surface @xmath21 so that @xmath20 intersects an essential disk @xmath22 in a single point .    a meridian which has the property above",
    "will be called _",
    "primitive_.    the if `` part of the statement is a well known result proved in lemma [ onlyif ] , however the only if '' part turned out to be much more difficult .",
    "when attempting to prove the conjecture one needs to deal with the following stituation :    we are given a minimal genus heegaard splitting @xmath0 for @xmath23 and we need to find genus heegaard splittings for @xmath16 or @xmath17 in which a meridian is primitive .",
    "we may assume that @xmath5 is a small neighborhood of the spine i.e. , @xmath5 is a regular neighborhood of the boundary torus union a regular neighborhood of the tunnels , and we can choose a decomposing annulus @xmath4 which intersects @xmath5 in a minimal number of disks .",
    "however it is exactly here that a major problem arises as it is concievable , a priori , that the interior of a single tunnel will intersect @xmath4 in a large number of points .",
    "if this occurs , the decomposing annulus @xmath4 will cut @xmath24 into pieces , a lot of which will be annuli . since the euler charecteristic of an annulus",
    "is zero we can have arbitrarily many of them .",
    "it follows that the induced ( as in section [ prelim ] ) heegaard splittings on @xmath16 and @xmath17 will be of very high genus and it is easy to generate such heegaard splittings where the meridian curve @xmath25 is primitive .",

    "1 )    the disk @xmath140 contains at most one arc @xmath126 of type i on its boundary .",
    "consider now an essential sub - annulus @xmath194 of @xmath4 containing the disks @xmath229 and @xmath230 .",
    "it is a meridional annulus in @xmath246 so we can cap off @xmath194 by two meridian disks @xmath247 and @xmath248 in @xmath246 to obtain a 2-sphere intersecting @xmath34 in exactly two points in @xmath247 and @xmath248 .",
    "if we attach the boundary of the 2-float to this 2-sphere along @xmath229 and @xmath230 we get a 2-torus @xmath249 . by the above lemma @xmath250",
    "is contained in @xmath249 . .",
    "assume that @xmath250 is an inessential curve on @xmath249 and bounds a disk @xmath242 there which does not contain the disks @xmath247 and @xmath248 .",
    "the intersection of @xmath250 with a core curve of the meridional annulus @xmath194 is even .",
    "similarly the intersection of @xmath251 with the boundary of a cocore disk of the 2-float is even .",
    "hence the number of arcs of type i is even and so is the number of @xmath143 arcs ( these are the arcs which intersect the boundary of a cocore disk of the 2-float ) . hence the number of arcs of type iii ( the @xmath126 arcs ) is also even . as a consequence the disk @xmath242 is a union of bands glued together to each other at their ends .",
    "the bands correspond to the areas in @xmath4 between the arcs of type i and between the arcs of type iii and also on the 2-float between the @xmath143 arcs ( see fig .",
    "4 ) .    since the bands are glued to each other along small arcs on both ends , the number of gluing arcs is equal to the number of bands .",
    "so an euler characteristic argument shows that    @xmath252    but this is obviously a contradiction and hence @xmath250 is essential in @xmath249 or bounds a disk @xmath242 containing one or both of @xmath247 and @xmath248 .",
    "fig . 4    if @xmath242 contains only one of @xmath247 or @xmath248 then the @xmath31-sphere @xmath253 intersects @xmath34 in a single point in contradiction .",
    "assume therefore , that @xmath242 contains both of @xmath247 and @xmath248 .",
    "consider the annulus @xmath254 .",
    "we can push @xmath195 by a small ambient isotopy relative to its boundary @xmath255 in the direction away from the @xmath31-float so that after the isoptopy @xmath195 does not intersect the disks @xmath229 and @xmath230 . if the sub - annuls @xmath256 contains disks of intersection with @xmath5",
    "then the annulus @xmath195 is not parallel into @xmath256 and the annulus @xmath257 is a new decomposing annulus intersecting @xmath5 in fewer disks than @xmath4 , in contradiction to the choice of @xmath4 .    if @xmath250 is an essential curve on @xmath249 we do 2-surgery on @xmath250 by removing an annulus neighborhood of @xmath250 and gluing two copies of @xmath176 . by an euler characteristic",
    "argument we obtain a 2-sphere intersecting @xmath34 in two points on @xmath247 and @xmath248 .",
    "if we remove @xmath247 and @xmath248 we obtain an annulus @xmath195 . as above",
    "can now replace the annulus @xmath194 by the annulus @xmath195 and get a new annulus @xmath258 which does not intersect the disks @xmath229 and @xmath230 .",
    "the annulus @xmath195 can not be parallel into @xmath194 as this would imply that @xmath258 is parallel into @xmath4 in contradiction to the choice of @xmath4 as minimizing the intersection with @xmath5 .",
    "if the sub - annuls @xmath256 contains disks of intersection with @xmath5 then the annulus @xmath195 is not parallel into @xmath256 and the annulus @xmath257 is a new decomposing annulus intersecting @xmath5 in fewer disks than @xmath4 , in contradiction to the choice of @xmath4 .    hence we conclude that the disks @xmath229 and @xmath230 must be the first and last disks in @xmath128 , i.e. , the two disks closest to @xmath259 and @xmath260 .",
    "this implies that each knot complement @xmath16 and @xmath17 contains at most one component of @xmath26 which is a @xmath31-float of genus zero .",
    "since @xmath5 is connected we can not have two @xmath31-floats of genus zero one on each side both intersecting @xmath4 in the disks @xmath229 and @xmath230 .    as an immediate application of theorem [ uturnprop ] we have the following bound on the tunnel number of @xmath9 in terms of the tunnel numbers of @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "note that in [ ss ] schultens and scharlemann have obtained a better bound .",
    "however we bring it here as it is an immediate corollary of our main theorem :    by the above theorem at most one component of @xmath26 is a @xmath31-float .",
    "hence for all other components @xmath261 we have @xmath262 is a surface so that @xmath263 , as @xmath210 is either a punctured @xmath31-sphere with at least three punctures or a surface of positive genus with at least one puncture .",
    "since we also have , by proposition [ innertunnelprop ] , at least one component with positive genus we have as a worst case the following situation :    one component @xmath198 of @xmath26 which intersects the vertical annuli and @xmath264 is an annulus .",
    "since @xmath5 is connected the other component @xmath198 of @xmath26 which intersects the vertical annuli must have at least one other disk of intersection with @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore we have one component which is a @xmath31-float , one component of genus one and all other components are @xmath7-floats of genus zero . for",
    "a closed surface of genus @xmath265 the latter type of components can number at most @xmath266 so @xmath267 and @xmath268 .",
    "hence by remark [ benefit ] :    [ bound ]    for all prime knots @xmath35 and @xmath36 in @xmath2 and @xmath9 we have :    @xmath269    the above theorem suggest that by ruling out @xmath27-floats of genus zero with @xmath270 one can get better bounds which would converge to approximately @xmath271 .",
