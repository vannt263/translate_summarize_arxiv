    "the invariant amplitude obtained by calculating a covariant feynman diagram can equivalently be given by the sum of the corresponding time - ordered diagrams in the old fashioned perturbation theory(ofpt ) .",
    "as it is well known@xcite , the individual time - ordered diagram is not invariant under some of the lorentz transformations , _",
    "e.g. _ , boost or rotation , while the covariant feynman diagram is completely lorentz invariant .",
    "under which part of the lorentz transformations the individual diagram is not invariant depends on whether we use the ordinary equal-@xmath2 quantization or the lightcone equal-@xmath0 quantization where @xmath3 .",
    "the poincar algebra in these two schemes are significantly different .",
    "it is often remarked that in the equal-@xmath2 quantization the boost operation is dynamic and the rotation is kinematic , while in the equal-@xmath0 quantization the rotation is dynamic and the boost operation is kinematic@xcite .",
    "these significantly different features of poincar algebra in two schemes lead to the non - invariance of the individual diagram under different part of lorentz transformations . in the equal-@xmath2 quantization ,",
    "the individual diagram is not invariant under the boost transformation , while in the equal-@xmath0 quantization the individual diagram is not invariant under the rotation .",
    "however , it is crucial to note that the property of rotation is very different from the property of boost operation because the rotation is compact _",
    "i.e. _ , closed and periodic , while the boost operation is open and not periodic .",
    "thus , one may take advantage of the rotation in equal-@xmath0 quantization .",
    "already , m. fuda@xcite suggested the angular averaging of the potential as a way of restoring poincar invariance in the explicit example of @xmath4 scattering problem .",
    "we have also realized that the physical on - shell partial wave amplitudes presented in ref.@xcite were in fact identical to the rotation average of the lightcone scattering partial wave amplitudes@xcite . in this paper , we give an example of rotation advantage in ofpt . if we make a rotation average of the individual diagram , then the result is of course invariant under rotation and thus the individual diagram can be made invariant under the rotation . the similar average procedure for the boost operation can not be made in the equal-@xmath2 quantization because the parameter space of boost , _",
    "i.e. _ , velocity is not compact .",
    "as we will show explicitly in this work , the individual @xmath0-ordered diagram can be made invariant under the entire lorentz transformation using an average procedure .",
    "furthermore , in the calculations of the two - body scattering amplitudes where the masses of two bodies are same , one does not need to calculate the entire number of @xmath0-ordered diagrams but to calculate only the half of the entire number of diagrams because the half of total number of diagrams is reproduced by the other half .",
    "thus , one can evaluate the magnitude of each diagram in the lorentz invariant way once the average procedure is fixed .    in the example of this work",
    ", we found that the higher fock - state contribution is very small in the lightcone quantization .",
    "our nontrivial point is that this smallness can be asserted in a reference - frame independent way . without loss of generality but for simplicity",
    ", we show this point using an explicit example of feynman amplitudes in @xmath5 theory@xcite . however , our method is generic to the equal-@xmath0 quantization scheme , and thus applicable to any other field theory . in this work ,",

    "now , let s consider changing the time in ofpt from @xmath2 to the lightcone time @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a unit vector on the lightcone surface ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath8 means @xmath9 ) .",

    "<S> we present a rotation average of the two - body scattering amplitude in the lightcone time(@xmath0)-ordered perturbation theory . using a rotation average procedure , we show that the contribution of individual time - ordered diagram can be quantified in a lorentz invariant way . </S>",
    "<S> the number of time - ordered diagrams can also be reduced by half if the masses of two bodies are same . in the numerical example of @xmath1 theory </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the higher fock - state contribution is quite small in the lightcone quantization . </S>"
