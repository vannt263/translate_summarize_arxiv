    "image reconstruction is a key problem in observational astronomy , in particular in optical interferometry , where it is needed to overcome existing ambiguities in the interpretation of simple visibility measurements .    in an array of _",
    "n _ telescopes , signals are combined in _",
    "@xmath2 n @xmath2 ( n-1 ) _ pairs or baselines to obtain _",
    "@xmath2 n @xmath2 ( n-1 ) _ measurements called complex visibilities .",
    "these visibilities are related to the object brightness distribution via the van cittert - zernike theorem :    @xmath3 dx \\ , dy$ ]    where _ x _ and _ y _ are angular displacements on the plane of the sky with the phase center as origin , _",
    "i(x , y ) _ is the brightness distribution of the target and _ u _ and _ v _ are the position vectors of the baselines projected on a plane perpendicular to the source direction , which together define the _ uv _ plane . in practical terms",
    ", the better the sampling of the _ uv _ plane in terms of baseline length , position angle , and number of measurements , the more faithful the reconstructed image will be relative to the true brightness distribution .    in order to recover the brightness distribution , several image reconstruction algorithms for interferometry",
    "have been developed : phase referencing using aips , hybrid mapping using difmap ( masoni et al . 2005 , masoni 2006 ) , the building block bispectrum method ( hofmann & weigelt 1993 ) , mira ( thiebaut 2005 ) , bsmem ( baron 2007 ; private communication ) , among others .    closure phase imaging is the standard method for imaging in optical interferometry . it has been applied since the 1980 s , initially to speckle interferometry ( weigelt et al .",
    "1998 ) and masked instrumentation and lately to optical interferometry with separate telescopes .",
    "this technique relies on two quantities related to the complex visibility - the squared visibility and the triple product - to perform image reconstruction .",
    "the squared visibility or power - spectrum is defined as :    @xmath4    and the triple product or bi - spectrum :    @xmath5    where _",
    "u@xmath6+u@xmath7=u@xmath8 , v@xmath6+v@xmath7=v@xmath8 , u@xmath6 , v@xmath7 , u@xmath6 , v@xmath7 _ , are vectors defining the position of three baselines and the asterisk denotes the complex conjugate . the triple product is the product of the complex visibilities on the baselines forming a closed loop joining any three telescopes ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the modulus of the triple product is the triple product amplitude and the argument is the closure phase .",
    "the closure phase is independent of atmospheric - induced phase variations .    [",

    "in general , the image reconstruction faired very well . this",
    "is denoted by the excellent astrometry and photometry of the individual image elements .",
    "some sources merit a separate discussion .",
    "we are able to detect the unresolved agn out to the sublimation radius .",
    "the total flux contained in this region is 91.6% compared to the 91.4% measured in the synthetic image .",
    "the result suggests that such observations will provide important constraints on the size of the sublimation region and torus in the nearest agn .    for the stellar surfaces ,",
    "our results show unprecedented detail .",
    "most of the flux is recovered in a compact region and careful inspection of the reconstructed images shows correspondence with individual regions of different brightness in the synthetic image .",
    "the edges of the stellar surface are also well reproduced .",
    "our results show that the use of the 6 at @xmath2 1 night configuration generally yields better reconstructed images than the 4 at @xmath2 3 nights configuration , even though the number of @xmath11 points is similar .",
    "this is particularly noted in images of stellar surfaces and in stellar disks / winds .",
    "this is in consonance with previous studies ( tuthill & monnier 2000 ; baron 2007 ) .",
    "the image reconstruction result is satisfactory with a low number of array elements when the source is compact ( tuthill & monnier 2000 ) .",
    "however , when the sources are more complex , a larger fourier plane coverage is needed and therefore more array elements are needed .    indeed it is the number of telescopes and not the number of observing nights ( and therefore total number of @xmath11 points ) that determine the image reconstruction outcome . in a system of _ n",
    "_ telescopes , the number of _ uv _ points is @xmath12 per night per integration point and the number of independent closure phases is _",
    "@xmath1 @xmath2 ( n-1 ) @xmath2 ( n-2 ) _ per night per integration point . with",
    "_ n=4 _ and 3 nights , for each integration point there are a total of 18 @xmath11 points ( therefore squared visibilities ) and a total of 9 closure phases . for _",
    "n=6 _ and 1 night , the number of squared visibilities and closure phases per integration point is 15 and 10 , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , the image reconstruction ( or fitting process ) can only make use of the instantaneous phases to create a model brightness .",
    "therefore , for a _ n=4 _ system , the image reconstruction uses the 3 instantaneous closure phases ( 3 per night ) , while with 6 telescopes there are now 10 independent closure phases .",
    "image reconstruction , whatever the method , is crucial when a high dynamic range ( @xmath131000 ) is required .",
    "our results show that the closer phase technique allows to achieve modest dynamic ranges .",
    "higher dynamic ranges can be obtained by using the vlti coupled with a phase referencing instrument , like prima ( deplanke et al . 2000 ) which will allow to reach k band magnitudes of 11 mag for the ats and 14 mag for the uts .",
    "the presence of nearby phase referencing sources will allow larger integration times on source and therefore higher dynamic range .",
    "next generation optical interferometric instrumention like the vsi will be designed to offer superb imaging capabilities in order to bypass ambiguities in the interpretation of visibility data .",
    "it will be particularly novel in that it will allow spatial resolutions of milliarcseconds , comparable to alma and even better the future jwst .    in order to test future vlti performance in terms of imaging",
    ", we have run several tests on key scientific cases .",
    "results show that with a simple 6 auxiliary telescope ( at ) configuration and 1 night observation , images of high image fidelity can be obtained . using the vlti alone",
    "will allow to achieve modest dynamic ranges , although in conjunction with a phase referencing instrument , k band magnitudes of 11 and 14 mag can be reached with the ats and uts , respectively .",
    "such diverse objects as agn , stellar surfaces and disks are shown possible to image with future vlti instumentation .",
