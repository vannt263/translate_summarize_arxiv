    "the distinction between blue star - forming galaxies and red , passively evolving ones has been know for a long time . in his seminal classification article , @xcite classified galaxies into two main groups , spirals and elllipticals .",
    "although unintended as a timeline for secular evolution  in hubble s own words ` the entire classification is purely empirical and without prejudice to theories of evolution ' @xcite  ellipticals were referred to as ` early - type galaxies ' and spirals as ` late types ' ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "our knowledge of stellar populations in galaxies has evolved considerably since then .",
    "today we know that spiral galaxies are blue due to young stars , and that their current star formation rates are higher than in ellipticals , with a younger population , on average . @xcite were the first to show that clustering properties of galaxies depend on galaxy type , with ellipticals showing stronger clustering properties than spirals .",
    "we also know that elliptical galaxies in the local universe are preferentially found in environments where the galaxy number density is higher such as clusteres of galaxies @xcite , which gives us important clues regarding the late evolution of galaxies .",
    "the same relation has been shown to extend to groups of galaxies @xcite and environments such as superclusters @xcite .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that spiral galaxies _ somehow _ transform into ellipticals at later times , for example through secular evolution or mergers with other galaxies .",
    "however , the existing bimodality in the galaxy distribution , with a clear distinction between blue spirals and red spheroids , and its establishment still remain a puzzle .",
    "other works have correlated the bimodality in galaxy properties with galaxy colors .",
    "@xcite were the first to show the correlation between colors and magnitudes of cluster galaxies in the local universe .",
    "the bimodality in galaxy colors and their correlations with galaxy morphology was first noted by @xcite .",
    "more recently , the color bimodality has been observed at low redshifts ( @xmath1 ) with the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) .",
    "later , many authors have shown this bimodality extends to earlier times , at least out to @xmath2 @xcite . as is the case for galaxy morphologies",
    ", several recent works have shown that galaxy colors are correlated with environment density ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the color distribution of galaxies can be described as two distinctive peaks , then one can denominate the minimum at intermediate color values the `` green valley '' .",
    "the question then arises : why does such a minimum exist , instead of a homogeneous distribution across the color - magnitude diagram ?    in order to study this intermediate population , one needs to determine proper selection criteria . @xcite",
    "have measured number densities in the color - magnitude diagram at low redshift ( @xmath1 ) and found that the galex @xmath3 color represents more efficient criterium to select green valley galaxies .",
    "ultraviolet emission originates from recent ( over the last tens of millions of years ) star - forming regions in the galaxy , while the @xmath4 band is more sensitive to the bulk of stellar mass , formed over the course of the galaxy s history . by subtracting the two ,",
    "one can clearly distinguish two populations , one actively forming stars and the other older , more passive , with a dynamic range of about six magnitudes in color .",
    "nevertheless , we need to be careful when defining transition galaxies ; the percentage of star - forming , obscured galaxies is high .",
    "these are typically galaxies with high ratio of current to past star formation , but which present redder colors due to dust obscuration ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also section [ sec : extinction ] ) .    the low number density ( or number deficit ) of galaxies in the green valley indicates that the transition between both groups occurs rapidly . a number of works attempt to explain why there is such a rapid evolution .",
    "@xcite postulate that supernova winds and outflows can play an important part , driving out gas that fuels star formation in the galaxy .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , have produced a hydrodynamical simulation of a major merger event which shows that , after a period of brief increase of star formation , the supermassive black hole created in the center of the merger remnant drives strong outflow winds that rapidly quench star formation . @xcite and @xcite provide observational support to this hypothesis , finding a large number of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in the green valley and concluding",
    "that feedback from such objects might be somehow quenching the star formation process .",
    "this is further supported by @xcite , who note that the coadded spectra of green valley galaxies at @xmath5 are distinct from coadded spectra of blue and red galaxies , with line ratios that show increased agn activity . @xcite",
    "go further and state that quenching is a combination of a mass - dependent quenching mechanism , proportional to the galaxy s star formation rate , and the effect of the hierarchical assembly of dark matter haloes .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite note that the merger fraction in the green valley is low , from the quantitative morphological analysis of @xmath6 optically selected transition galaxies .",
    "the authors then conclude that mild external processes ( such as galaxy harassment ) or secular evolution are the dominant factors at these redshifts .",
    "this rationale assumes , however , that galaxies move in one direction only in the color - magnitude diagram , from blue to red .",
    "nevertheless , there are several cases in the literature that indicate ongoing and/or recent gas accretion , in addition to comparatively high star formation rates in elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although these cases are interesting , they are relatively rare , and one can in general assume that galaxies with intermediate colors are currently in the process of quenching their star formation",
    ".    to infer how rapidly galaxies are moving across the green valley , @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) have used spectroscopic features in green valley galaxies to obtain information on their star formation histories ( see section [ sec : method ] for details ) . along with measurements of typical galaxy masses and number densities in the color - magnitude diagram ,",
    "the authors have been able to determine the mass flux across the green valley at low redshifts ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the measured value of @xmath7 m@xmath8 yr@xmath9 mpc@xmath10 agrees remarkably well with expectations from the growth of the red sequence and the depletion of galaxies in the blue sequence at such redshifts @xcite , despite the shortcomings of the simple model assumed .",
    "furthermore , paper i presents evidence for an increase in number density of agn in the green valley ( from measured [ oiii ] luminosities ) , supporting the aforementioned studies that relate agn activity with the quenching of star formation ( although the correlation between [ oiii ] luminosities and quenching timescales is not unequivocal ) .    in this work",
    ", we apply the methods introduced in paper i to a sample of galaxies at higher redshift .",
    "this will allow us to measure the mass flux in the green valley at intermediate redshifts , comparing with results found for galaxies in the low - redshift universe .",
    "although the technique is simple , the data acquisition process proves challenging , since it requires reliable measurements of absorption features in galaxies at redshifts of ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "we have set out to obtain the required data , and the work presented here includes the deepest spectra of green valley galaxies to date .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : method ] , we describe in detail the methodology used to infer star formation histories of galaxies , including modelling of stellar populations . in section [ sec : gvobs ] we describe the observations and data reduction used to produce the spectra which were then used to measure star formation histories and quenching timescales , in addition to ancillary data used to measure number densities in the color magnitude diagram , luminosity functions and extinction correction . section [ sec : gvresults ] shows our results , including the measured mass flux density at @xmath0 and in section [ sec : gvdiscussion ] we discuss those results in light of galaxy evolution models .",
    "we summarize our findings in section [ sec : gvsummary ] . throughout this paper ,",
    "we use ab magnitudes , and assume standard cosmology , with @xmath11 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "the method to study the mass flux in the green valley has been introduced by @xcite .",
    "we summarize here the description presented in that work .      in order to measure the mass flux for a given color in the color - magnitude diagram , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the @xmath17 color of the galaxy",
    ", we can assume that    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the average mass of a galaxy in that color - magnitude bin , and @xmath20 is how fast galaxies are moving through the same bin .",
    "in practice , we measure average values in a two - dimensional bin . dividing the above equation by the comoving density",
    "probed , we calculate    @xmath21    in this case , the comoving mass density @xmath22 is simply the comoving number density ( @xmath23 ) multiplied by the typical galaxy mass in that bin ( @xmath19 ) . what we propose to measure is the mass flux density @xmath24 .",
    "since we can constrain @xmath23 and @xmath19 independently from the star formation histories , we are only left with the task of measuring the color evolution rate for a given galaxy or bin .      in order to measure the color evolution rates",
    ", we make some simplifying assumptions :    1 .",
    "galaxies only move towards redder colors , i.e. we do not consider starbursting red galaxies moving downward in the color - magnitude diagram ; 2 .",
    "the star formation histories in all galaxies are described by a constant star formation rate for the first few gyr ( approximately 6 gyr ) followed by a period of exponentially declining star formation rates : + @xmath25    we discuss the implications of this model in section [ sec : sfh ] .    in order to measure the exponential index @xmath26",
    ", we apply the same methodology described in @xcite to measure the rest - frame 4000  break and the equivalent width of @xmath27 absorption .",
    "the first is created by the accumulation of a large number of ionized metal absorption lines shortward of 4000  @xcite .",
    "the elements responsible for these lines are multiply ionized in hot stars , resulting in smaller opacities in the integrated spectra of younger galaxies , and thus the break correlates with the age of the stellar population .",
    "the latter is mainly present in the stellar photosphere of smaller early - type stars ( mostly a stars ) , which dominate @xmath28 gyr after a starburst event ( and after the o and b stars evolved off the main sequence ) .    in this work",
    ", we use the same definitions as in paper i , in order to maintain uniformity across different redshifts . the first index , @xmath29 , is defined as the ratio of the average flux density @xmath30 in the bands 3850 - 3950 and 4000 - 4100  , following the definition of @xcite .",
    "the narrow bands ensure that the ratio is weakly dependent on flux calibrations and other broad band effects that may arise from data reduction . for the latter ,",
    "@xmath31 is the absorption equivalent width ; the continuum is defined by fitting a straight line through the average flux density between 4041.60 and 4079.75  , on one end , and 4128.50 and 4161.00  , on the other .",
    "the equivalent width , then , is given simply by    @xmath32    @xcite showed that these indices trace a well defined region in a @xmath33 vs. @xmath31 diagram .",
    "furthermore , different star formation history tracks  for instance a single starburst event versus a continuous star formation rate ",
    "trace distinct regions within this diagram .",
    "we therefore use our measured spectral indices as defined above to distinguish between different star formation histories , in our case as given by different @xmath26 values .    in figure [",
    "fig : dn_hd_model ] , we show 5 tracks on the @xmath33 vs. @xmath31 diagram given by 5 distinct @xmath26 values ( 0.5 , 1.0 , 2.0 , 5.0 and 20.0 gyr@xmath9 ) .",
    "these models were produced with the @xcite models  with @xcite initial mass functions , padova 1994 stellar evolutionary tracks and solar metallicities  by varying ages throughout star formation histories as described in equation [ eq : sfh ] .",
    "the range of values for @xmath34 is limited to @xmath35 , so that the oldest models are always below the universe age at the highest redshift we measure .",
    "this does not have a major impact on our results , since @xmath34 is typically larger than the time when @xmath29 and @xmath31 have stabilized .",
    "we notice very distinct tracks , with the strongly quenched models ( higher @xmath26 presenting higher @xmath31 values ) .     vs. @xmath31 for models with different star formation histories .",

    "therefore , models to the right are quenching star formation more rapidly . ]    finally , the measurement of @xmath20 is given by the width of the color range in magnitudes used to determine the green valley divided by the duration of time when the galaxy is within those boundaries .",
    "we illustrate this in figure [ fig : age_nuv_r_model ] , where we plot the @xmath36 color as a function of time after the initial period of constant star formation , with the green valley limits indicated by horizontal lines .",
    "as expected , models with higher values of gamma ( i.e. that are quenching their star formation more rapidly ) change colors faster .",

    "one might think that the simple quenching of individual blue galaxies , be it by mergers , agn activity or any other mechanism , would be sufficient to produce the red sequence .",

    "comparison with the mass - flux at low - redshift ( paper i ) shows that the mass flux occurred at brighter magnitudes at high redshift ( figure [ fig : mass_flux_vs_mag ] ) , indicating the build - up of the most massive end of the red sequence at earlier times , which is in qualitative agreement with the evolution of the luminosity function .",
    "our sample reliably covers magnitudes down to @xmath74 ( not accounting for extinction correction ) and @xmath75 ( accounting for extinction correction ) , allowing us to verify the decrease in number density and mass flux towards fainter objects ( see figure [ fig : lumfunction ] ) .",
    "this represents a _ downsizing _ of the green valley evolution , with the red sequence forming `` from the top down '' : in the past , more massive star - forming galaxies were being formed and subsequently quenched , forming the more massive red sequence galaxies . at later times , star formation shifts to less massive galaxies ; these are then quenched as well , and the fainter end of the red sequence is created .",
    "it has been argued before that the massive galaxies in the red sequence form in earlier times . as an example , @xcite have measured the stellar mass function of the red sequence up to redshift @xmath2 and have noticed that the number density of less massive galaxies has grown more than the number density of massive galaxies since that epoch .",
    "the evolution we observe in the luminosity function supports this idea , with a change in the faind - end slope that indicates a deficit of faint , less massive galaxies when compared to the same population at lower redshift .",
    "the analysis of objects in the green valley , on the other hand , describes this scenario for the first time based on observations of the mass flux of intermediate galaxies alone .",
    "however , this is not the complete picture . @xcite",
    "call upon dry mergers to explain observed properties of the brightest red galaxies .",
    "these mergers correspond to the interaction between two or more red sequence galaxies , with little gas involved .",
    "the absence of copious gas diminishes the subsequent burst in star formation that is otherwise expected in wet mergers , between gas - rich galaxies .",
    "these dry mergers hence result in an increase in stellar mass , with no coupled burst in activity",
    ". it would be interesting to compare the mass flux density at the very massive end of the color - magnitude diagram to infer whether that is sufficient to create all massive galaxies or if dry mergers are a necessity , but this is currently an impossible task due to large uncertainties and small number statistics ( especially at these limiting magnitudes ) .",
    "it could be argued that changes in galaxy properties related to an increase in the mass - to - light ratio could account for the dimming of red sequence galaxies , in such a way that galaxies of a given stellar mass would appear fainter at recent epochs . while it is true that the mass - to - light ratio increases as a function of time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the change in the @xmath4-band is not large enough to account for the evolution of the luminosity function by itself , especially for passive galaxies .",
    "we have measured the mass - to - light ratio of galaxies of a constant color @xmath76 as a function of redshift , to evaluate any possible evolution within the color range covered by the luminosity functions , based on the k - band measurements from @xcite .",
    "the average value between @xmath77 is @xmath78 , while at higher redshifts , @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "we can conclude , then , that the increase in mass - to - light ratios of red galaxies is not high enough to account for the evolution in the luminosity function , and galaxies in that color range are indeed more massive at higher redshift .",
    "the mechanism through which quenching occurs is as yet unclear .",
    "as we have seen above , merger activity may not be as relevant ; agn activity is also called upon , and it is indeed found that green valley galaxies show an increase in agn fraction  although actual correlation with star formation quenching has not been unequivocally shown ( paper i ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "it is important to consider , first , that most of the stellar mass in red sequence galaxies is not formed while the galaxy is in the red sequence @xcite .",
    "this lends support to our assumption ( 1 ) , which states that galaxies are only moving redward in the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "however , this is not strictly true ; we do know a fraction of elliptical galaxies , even in the local universe , show signs of recent starburst events @xcite .",
    "if we take into account that a fraction of galaxies in the green valley are turning _ blue _ , instead , then the inferred mass flux would be _",
    "smaller_.    at the same time , in paper i we have argued how our choice of star formation histories influences our results . in general , assuming shorter periods of constant star formation or different models for the time evolution decreases the final calculated value for @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , we conservatively assume our measured mass flux density as an _ upper value _ for the actual flux in transition galaxies from the blue to the red sequence .",
    "still , a decrease by 0.5 dex brings us to closer agreement with the inferred growth of the red sequence . at the same time",
    ", the difference in final results combined with the observed change in the luminosity function and the distribution of @xmath26 values makes it safe to assume the evolution in mass flux density from @xmath0 to @xmath1 is real .",
    "finally , one can argue the star formation history assumed in this work is simplistic .",
    "it has been even argued that star forming galaxies follow an inverted @xmath82 model , with an exponentially _ increasing _ star formation history @xcite . in any case , a more realistic approach to modeling the star formation histories of galaxies could yield different results ( likely smaller fluxes , as argued above ) .",
    "thus , we are currently in the process of producing models that do not rely on _ ad hoc _ star formation histories , but instead are drawn from cosmological n - body simulations and semi - analytic models , generating more physically motivated star formation histories",
    ". we will compare our spectra with these more refined models in a future paper ( martin et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    "we have shown results of a spectroscopic survey of over 100 galaxies in the green valley , i.e. transition objects with intermediate colors between the blue and the red sequences that are believed to be currently quenching their star formation .",
    "the data represent the deepest spectra of green valley galaxies ever obtained at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath0 ) .    by using measurements of spectral indices - namely the break at 4000  and the equivalent width of the h@xmath50 absorption line , we are able to infer the star formation histories of these objects , following the method first presented in @xcite .",
    "if one assumes an exponential decline in star formation rates , it is then possible to measure timescales involved in transitioning from the population of star - forming galaxies into the red sequence . combined with independent measurements for the number densities in the green valley and typical galaxy masses , we are able to measure the mass flux density between @xmath83 .",
    "our measurements have shown that the mass flux density at these redshifts is higher by a factor of @xmath725 than in the low - redshift universe ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "this can be attributed to two factors : first , the evolution of the luminosity function over the course of the last 6 gyr , which means at @xmath0 the flux is dominated by the brighter and more massive objects .",
    "second , quenching timescales are shorter at higher redshift , and galaxies transition more rapidly from the blue to the red sequence . in addition , we also show that our results are in good agreement with estimates for the build - up of mass in the red sequence since @xmath84 .",
    "we argue for a scenario in which the red - sequence is built `` from the top - down '' , meaning that the most massive objects were quenched at earlier times , shifting towards the evolution of less massive galaxies today .",
    "since we have calculated the quenching timescales of individual objects , the next logical step is to compare our results with other observable properties in the green valley galaxies , in particular merger signatures and agn activity .",
    "we expect this analysis will help clarify the role of each of these processes in the total quenching of star formation , both at low and at high redshifts .",
