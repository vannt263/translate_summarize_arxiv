    "the characteristic and distinguishing feature of lovelock action is , notwithstanding its polynomial character , that the resulting equation of motion for gravitation is always second order .",
    "this is however well - known .",
    "we wish to point out one other distinguishing universal property of lovelock gravity ( all along by lovelock gravity we would mean pure lovelock @xmath2th order term without previous terms @xmath5 ) .",
    "as einstein gravity is kinematic in @xmath6 dimension and becomes dynamic in @xmath7 dimension , lovelock gravity , as defined by @xmath2th order riemann curvature , @xmath8 which is a homogeneous polynomial in riemann , is also similarly kinematic in @xmath0 and becomes dynamic in @xmath1 dimension for any @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "that is @xmath9 implies @xmath10 in all odd @xmath11 dimensions , in particular @xmath4 gauss - bonnet is kinematic in @xmath12 and becomes dynamic in @xmath13 dimension .",
    "this is also a universal feature of lovelock gravity .",
    "the natural question that arises is , what should be the right gravitational equation for higher dimension @xmath14 ?",
    "should it be einstein or einstein - lovelock or pure lovelock in @xmath15 @xcite ?",
    "if kinematic and dynamic character in odd and even dimension is to be a universal feature of gravity , it can not be anything else than lovelock gravity . this property rules out einstein and einstein - lovelock gravity for @xmath14 and singles out lovelock gravity .",
    "further it also turns out that for lovelock gravity in odd and even dimensions , thermodynamical parameters bear a universal relation to horizon radius ; i.e. entropy always goes as @xmath16 in even @xmath1 dimension @xcite .",
    "it is both necessary and sufficient condition for universality of thermodynamical parameters in terms of horizon radius that it is lovelock gravity .",
    "it has been proposed @xcite that right gravitational equation in @xmath14 is pure lovelock equation which includes einstein equation for @xmath3 . in this paper",
    ", we shall in particular investigate problem of gravitational collapse which concerns an important open question , what is the ultimate fate of a collapsing star , is it a black hole or naked singularity ?",
    "penrose proclaimed in his famous cosmic censorship conjecture ( ccc ) that end result of collapse is always a black hole .",
    "that is singularity is always covered by event horizon and there occur no naked singularities .",
    "there do however exist examples of inhomogeneous dust collapse in which there do emanate null geodesics from singularity before apparent horizon is formed thereby indicating nakedness of singularity in general relativity @xcite , einstein gauss bonnet @xcite , and einstein lovelock gravity @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to study this problem for pure lovelock gravity and contrast it with einstein gravity in higher dimensions .",
    "it would be shown that collapse dynamics would be qualitatively similar for @xmath17 for lovelock gravity to that of einstein gravity in @xmath18 dimensions .",
    "in contrast it would be quite different for einstein gravity in higher dimensions .",
    "this would be yet another discriminator between einstein and lovelock gravity .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in the next sec .",
    "we give a quick overview of lovelock gravity which is followed by study of gravitational collapse of dust and vaidya null radiation . we conclude with a discussion .",
    "following dadhich @xcite we define the lovelock curvature polynomial @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 the analogue of @xmath23 order einstein tensor is given by @xmath24 and @xmath25 note that @xmath26 in @xmath27 dimension for arbitrary metric @xmath28 . since @xmath29 is a function of the metric and its first and second derivatives which are all arbitrary , it must vanish in @xmath30 .",
    "that is , @xmath31 identically in @xmath27 dimension . on the other hand for the general lovelock case ,",
    "the lagrangian is non - zero for @xmath30 but its variation vanishes identically .",
    "the lovelock equation of motion is given by @xmath32",
    "we study gravitational collapse of dust and null dust in lovelock gravity in higher dimensions .",

    "in contrast , it would be quite different for einstein gravity in higher dimensions .",
    "spherically symmetric homogeneous dust collapse model analysed by oppenheimer and snyder @xcite led to the establishment viewpoint that end state of a star , with remnant mass more than a few solar mass , would lead to formation of black holes in general theory of relativity .",
    "this model still serves as a role model for understanding some of the key features associated with black holes , appearance of singularity and event and apparent horizon formation @xcite .",
    "it is no surprise that the phenomenon of visible singularity too was discovered many years later in dust collapse , generalising from homogeneous to inhomogeneous density @xcite .",
    "today we have a complete understanding of the role of initial data in final state of collapse @xcite .",
    "choice of dust as matter model has been supported for collapse studies since in late stages of continued collapse though we expect pressure to attain a upper bound the density continues to grow indefinitely @xcite .",
    "thus in higher dimensional generalisation of einstein s theory of general relativity to gauss - bonnet gravity first we consider gravitational collapse of a spherically symmetric dust cloud .",
    "the choice of dust as matter models makes comoving coordinates a preferred choice for a coordinate system .",
    "the line element in these coordinates can be written as @xmath34 here @xmath35 ( 5 or 6 ) is spacetime dimension .",
    "the only non - zero components of energy momentum tensor are @xmath36      the vanishing of @xmath37 component fixes @xmath38 where , in analogy with four dimensional case , @xmath39 can be identified as the total energy function .",
    "considering special case of marginally bound dust , where dust particles start at rest from infinity , we can set @xmath40 . from ( [ equation ] )",
    "we write @xmath41 and due to symmetry other angular components are equal to @xmath42 .",
    "the vanishing of radial pressure gives two family of solutions , namely , static which correspond to @xmath43 , and solutions with constant velocity @xmath44 therefore , area coordinate can be integrated as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is an integration parameter .",
    "the other integration constant is fixed using @xmath47 as the scaling surface where @xmath48 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that for this solution ( [ solr ] ) other components of pressure vanish identically and we do not have any additional constraints .",
    "the remaining freedom @xmath46 can be interpreted as follows .",
    "since we are considering marginally bound models where every collapsing shell is at rest at infinity .",
    "thus @xmath46 is identically zero in this case .",
    "thus @xmath49 , there is no collapse and we have a static solution .",
    "this is expected since gravity is kinematic in five dimension for gauss - bonnet gravity analogous to @xmath6-dimensional einstein gravity .      as in five dimension ,",

    "this allows us to define integration constant @xmath54 as mass function .",
    "note that unlike four dimensional case where potential energy goes as @xmath55 here it is @xmath56 .",
    "this equation can be integrated as @xmath57 where we have used scaling freedom @xmath58 to fix the integration constant .",
    "again , the solution is strikingly similar to the four dimensional gr which can be obtained by replacing @xmath59 by @xmath60 everywhere .",
    "we could generalise it to any @xmath33 dimension to write @xmath61 where , for we have gr , gauss - bonnet and cubic lovelock respectively for @xmath62 and so on .    from eqs .",
    "( [ dens ] ) and ( [ eom ] ) the expression for energy density is @xmath63 we have both shell crossing ( @xmath64 ) and shell focusing ( @xmath65 ) singularities .",
    "it is interesting to draw a comparison with four dimensional case in einstein gravity where we have derivative of the mass function in the numerator and not of its square .",
    "this arises because mass is a geometrical quantity and we have quadratic terms in curvature in the left hand side whereas right hand side is usual energy density .",
    "generalising the argument for @xmath33 dimensional marginally bound collapse , we write @xmath66    the singularity curve in this case is given by @xmath67 it is instructive to calculate the time of formation of singularity at the centre . the functional dependence of mass function near the centre can be calculated using eq .",
    "( [ dens2 ] ) as @xmath68 where we have used scaling on the initial surface and @xmath69 is the initial central density of collapsing cloud .",
    "thus time of formation of singularity at the centre is @xmath70 in the corresponding four dimensional einstein gravity the time of singularity formation is inversely proportional to the square root of central density . thus collapse slows down in gauss - bonnet theory .",
    "moreover , in the naive dimensional extension of gr to six dimension the time of formation of central singularity continues to depend on central density as the inverse square root . extending to @xmath33 dimensional case ,",
    "we can write @xmath71 and the central singularity in terms of central density as @xmath72    to further our analogy of six dimensional gauss - bonnet gravity with four dimensional einstein theory we consider now the causal structure of singularity .",
    "the four dimensional inhomogeneous dust collapse model gave us the first generic violation of cosmic censorship conjecture @xcite . in what follows we consider a simplified version of singular geodesic analysis by barve et al .",
    "@xcite . to show",
    "if singularity is visible , at least locally , we consider out - going radial null geodesics in the six dimensional line element ( [ metric ] ) with solution ( [ sol6 ] ) and @xmath40 : @xmath73 if we assume existence of such geodesics with their past end - points at the central singularity @xmath74 , we can consider the following approximate form for the geodesics near the centre @xmath75 here both @xmath76 and @xmath77 are positive for geodesics to exist in spacetime . in case",
    "when leading exponent causing inhomogeneity is equal to @xmath76 the constant @xmath77 has a upper bound for singularity to be visible .",
    "consider an initial density profile of the form @xmath78 to leading order near singularity . from eq .",
    "( [ dens2 ] ) we get the following form for the `` mass function '' near the centre @xmath79 now , using eq .",
    "( [ thesol ] ) , we can derive an expression for @xmath80 near the centre , which we need for analysing radial null geodesics , @xmath81 } { \\left[1-\\frac{5}{4 } { \\cal f } t\\right]^{1/5 } } , \\ ] ] where @xmath82 .",
    "along the assumed singular geodesic we have @xmath83 , substituting @xmath84 and equating with @xmath85 we get the desired roots equation as @xmath86 } { \\left[1-\\frac{5}{4 } { \\cal f } \\tau_1\\right]^{1/5 } } , \\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath87 and @xmath88 . if this equation admits a solution with desired values of parameters we have at least one radial null geodesic terminating at singularity .",
    "as mentioned earlier for geodesics to lie in spacetime we should have @xmath89 .",
    "this in - equality can be easily understood since in case @xmath90 the slope of outgoing radial null curves is more than that of singularity and thus are not part of spacetime . in the first case @xmath91 we have in the leading order @xmath92 thus we have a self - consistent solution with @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "since we are considering the case @xmath91 , @xmath95 can take values 1 to 4 . again , this should be seen in comparison with what is observed in collapse of marginally bound dust in four dimensional einstein gravity .",
    "when first non - zero term in the expansion of density around centre is either @xmath96 or @xmath97 singularity is always visible and black hole sets only for @xmath98 in four dimensional einstein gravity .",
    "however in gauss - bonnet case this window enlarges it is only at @xmath99 that black hole sets in and it is naked singularity for all @xmath100 to @xmath101 .    in case @xmath102 , the equation for the radial null curves can be written as @xmath103}{\\left[\\left(-\\frac{f_n}{4f_0}\\right)-\\frac{x}{t_s(0)}\\right]^{1/5 } } r^{4n/5 } .\\ ] ] thus @xmath99 and existence or otherwise of a positive definite root depends on the following sixth order polynomial equation , @xmath104 y^5 + 5 b y^4 -10",
    "b^2 y^3 \\nonumber \\\\+10 b^3 y^2 - 5 b^4 y + b^5=0 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have defined @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "quantity @xmath107 is related to central density and hence is positive definite , and since star should have a decreasing density away from the centre @xmath108 is negative and thus @xmath109 .",
    "the parameter @xmath110 is a measure of inhomogeneity for a given central density .",
    "the existence of a positive root depends on eq .",
    "( [ hex ] ) which is a sixth order polynomial and does not allow determination of roots in general .",
    "however , using descartes rule of signs this equation can admit six , four , two or zero ( even ) positive and no negative roots .",
    "since we have reduced it to a one parameter equation a simple numerical evaluation shows that for @xmath111 this equation allows double roots .",
    "there is an additional restriction on @xmath77 by the slope of the singularity curve since we want geodesic lie in the spacetime . for @xmath112",
    "we have @xmath113 and we have only blackhole formation .    the generalisation to any dimension can be done as follows .",
    "if we consider a general density profile ( [ in - den ] ) , where @xmath95 characterises order of inhomogeneity , we can find an outgoing singular geodesic of the form @xmath83 with constraint @xmath91 and @xmath114 and the tangent @xmath115 .",
    "thus , as we move from gr to lovelock more and more of initial data space , specified in terms of initial density , leads to formation of visible singularities .",
    "the threshold of transition is given by @xmath116;i.e .",
    "@xmath117 for @xmath118 for corresponding to einstein , gauss - bonnet and so on .",
    "the point to be noted is that there is a unique relation between inhomogeneity parameter @xmath95 and lovelock order @xmath2 for the even dimension @xmath1s .",
    "the critical branch solution ( @xmath98 in general relativity and @xmath99 in gauss - bonnet theory ) serves as another distinguishing feature between naive extensions of gr to higher dimension and the lovelock collapse . in 4d",
    "gr the well known transition between naked singularity and black holes occurs at @xmath98 ( for marginally bound case ) , where depending on other free parameters we can have either naked singularity or a black hole .",
    "for @xmath119 singularity is always visible and for @xmath120 it is always covered . in five dimensional gr naked singularity window shrinks and it is naked only for @xmath121 .",
    "for @xmath122 we have phase transition and for larger @xmath95 it is always a black hole . in six",
    "dimensional case this picture changes completely . for @xmath121",
    "it continues to be visible whereas for any larger @xmath95 it is always a black hole .",
    "therefore there is no more any transition branch , and the same is true for all higher dimensions than @xmath13 .",
    "in contrast for lovelock there would always occur transition phase for @xmath123 in @xmath33 dimension as demonstrated in particular for @xmath13-dimensional gauss - bonnet collapse .",
    "this is because gravitational ( thereby collapse ) dynamics is similar in all even @xmath33 dimensions like the @xmath7-dimensional gr .",
    "of course the window of visibility of singularity widens because lovelock gravity becomes weaker with @xmath2 as potential goes as @xmath124 .",
    "the lovelock curvature polynomial in six dimensions is given by , @xmath125 and the corresponding scalar invariant @xmath126 reads @xmath127 it is instructive to compare it with the corresponding six dimensional gr case .",
    "the acceleration equation corresponding to vanishing of radial pressure is given by @xmath128 and the kretschmann scalar @xmath129 is @xmath130 the kretschmann scalar in either case has the similar fall off behavior .",
    "this can be understood as follows . for @xmath1 ,",
    "einstein potential goes as @xmath131 and curvature as @xmath132 and hence @xmath133 will go as @xmath134 while for lovelock we have respectively @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "the kretschmann scalar has therefore the same degree of divergence for both einstein and lovelock gravity .",
    "this shows that strength of singularity remains the same and it does not distinguish between einstein and pure lovelock gravity for the given even dimension .",
    "however for lovelock gravity there is no collapse in any odd dimension .      the gravitational collapse of spherical matter in the form of radiation ( null dust ) described by the vaidya metric is well studied @xcite . in gr , it turns out that as dimension increases , the window for naked singularity shrinks .",
    "that is , gravity seems to get strengthened with an increase in dimensions of space @xcite . in this context ,",
    "one question that could naturally arise is , what happens in gravitational collapse of null dust in the pure lovelock gravity ?",
    "inclusion of vaidya null dust in said contest is quite straightforward by writing the corresponding vacuum solution in eddington advanced time and then making mass function of it .",
    "it would then describe a null radiation zone with radially flowing null rays .",
    "let us begin with the general @xmath35-dimensional spherically symmetric spacetime , in advanced eddington time coordinate @xmath138 , described by the metric @xcite :    @xmath139    where @xmath140 is the proper radial coordinate , @xmath141 is an advanced time coordinate , and @xmath142.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it proves useful to introduce a local mass function @xmath143 defined by @xmath144 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath143 is an arbitrary function of advanced time @xmath138 and radial coordinate @xmath145 . when @xmath146 , it is the vaidya solution in higher dimension @xcite .",
    "the usual vaidya solution follows for @xmath147 and @xmath146 .    for obtaining analogue of vaidya solution @xcite in lovelock gravity",
    ", we note that @xmath148 where @xmath149 is density of null fluid .",
    "the equation we need to solve is @xmath150 which is lovelock gravitational equation .",
    "the standard way to do it is to transform lovelock analogue of schwarzschild solution to eddington advanced time and write @xmath151 .",
    "this would satisfy the above equation and the metric would read as follows : @xmath152 dv^2 \\nonumber \\\\+2 dv dr + r^2 d\\omega_{d-2}^2 . \\label{sola}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is lovelock analogue of vaidya solution for @xmath1 .",
    "it would automatically match with the static version at the null boundary .",
    "in odd @xmath0 , we have lovelock analogue btz black hole which would exist in all odd dimensions",
    ".    we now turn to collapse of null dust to see under what conditions black hole or naked singularity result ?",
    "the physical situation here is that of a radial influx of null fluid in an initially empty region of lovelock de sitter spacetime .",
    "the first shell arrives at @xmath153 at time @xmath154 and the final at @xmath155 .",
    "a central singularity of growing mass is developed at @xmath153 .",
    "for @xmath156 we have @xmath157,i.e .",
    "lovelock de sitter spacetime , and for @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 is positive definite .",
    "the metric for @xmath154 to @xmath155 is lovelock vaidya , and for @xmath161 we have lovelock schwarzschild solution . in order to get an analytical solution for our case , we choose , @xmath162    for radial null geodesics , we readily write @xmath163 .",
    "\\label{eq : de1}\\ ] ] clearly , this has singularity at @xmath153 , @xmath154 .",
    "the nature ( naked singularity or black hole ) of the collapsing solutions can be characterized by the existence of radial null geodesics coming out of singularity .",
    "the motion near singularity is characterized by roots of an algebraic equation which we derive next .",
    "( [ eq : de1 ] ) , upon using eq .",
    "( [ eq : mv ] ) , turns out to be @xmath164 \\label{eq : de2}\\ ] ] where @xmath165 is the tangent to a possible outgoing geodesic .",
    "the central shell focusing singularity is at least locally naked ( for brevity we have addressed it as naked throughout this paper ) , iff there exists @xmath166 which satisfies @xmath167 or , @xmath168 with @xmath169 .",
    "thus any solution @xmath170 of the eq .",
    "( [ eq : ae ] ) would correspond to naked singularity of spacetime;i.e . to future",
    "directed null geodesics emanating from singularity @xmath171 .",
    "the smallest such @xmath172 corresponds to the earliest ray emanating from singularity and is called cauchy horizon of spacetime .",
    "if @xmath172 is the smallest positive root of ( [ eq : ae ] ) , then there are no naked singularities in the region @xmath173 .",
    "hence in the absence of positive real roots , the central singularity is not naked ( censored ) because in that case there are no outgoing future directed null geodesics emanating from singularity .",
    "thus , occurrence of positive real roots implies that the strong ccc is violated , though not necessarily the weak ccc .",
    "obviously for the critical dimension @xmath0 , we get @xmath174 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : ae ] ) has a trivial solution @xmath175 .",
    "this is as expected as gravity is kinematic here .",
    "we now examine the condition for occurrence of naked singularity for @xmath1 . with a straightforward calculation",
    "it can be shown that eq .",
    "( [ eq : ae ] ) always admits two real positive roots @xmath176 and @xmath177 for @xmath178 , where @xmath179 is the critical value of the parameter @xmath180 discriminating between naked singularity and black hole .",
    "the larger of the two roots , say @xmath177 corresponds to cauchy horizon .",
    "thus it follows that singularity will be naked if @xmath181 . on the other hand",
    "if , the inequality is reversed , @xmath182 no naked singularity would form and gravitational collapse would result in black hole . when @xmath183 , the two roots coincide to @xmath184 ( say ) , and then from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ae ] ) , we have @xmath185 and which on substituting into ( [ eq : ae ] ) , results to @xmath186 and the value of the critical root at @xmath187 @xmath188 for the familiar einstein case @xmath3 , we have @xmath189 and @xmath190 while they are @xmath191 and @xmath192 for @xmath4 gauss - bonnet gravity .      for gauging strength of singularity",
    "we compute kretschmann scalar which is square of corresponding curvature and it shows how curvature diverges .",
    "let us set @xmath193 as it represents constant curvature .",
    "lovelock gravity is always kinematic in odd dimension which will give null @xmath194 while it will not be riemann flat and @xmath133 will be non - zero falling off as @xmath195 .    for the dynamic @xmath13-dimensional case , we have @xmath196 while its corresponding riemann square goes : @xmath197 however the corresponding scalar for @xmath13 dimensional einstein collapse is given by @xmath198 which has the same fall off as gauss - bonnet collapse .",
    "this is rather remarkable that the strength of the singularity does not discriminate between einstein and lovelock gravity .",
    "in einstein gravity for dust ( null as well as non - null ) collapse , it turns out that as dimension of spacetime is increased the threshold inhomogeneity separating black hole and naked singularity also increases .",
    "that is compared to @xmath7 dimension , greater degree of inhomogeneity is required for formation of naked singularity .",
    "higher dimension therefore favors black hole .",
    "in contrast , for pure lovelock gravity , it is the other way round . as @xmath1 increases threshold decreases thereby implying even a lesser degree of inhomogeneity could lead to naked singularity formation .",
    "in contrast to einstein , lovelock gravity hence favors naked singularity as even dimension increases .",
    "this could be understood as follows . in einstein gravity",
    ", gravitational force goes as @xmath199 which means it becomes stronger with increase in dimension .",
    "stronger gravitational pull should naturally favor black hole . on the other hand for lovelock",
    ", force goes as @xmath200 and that clearly weakens with @xmath2 or @xmath35 .",
    "that is why it favors naked singularity .    despite this contrasting behavior ,",
    "the kretshmann scalars for both einstein and lovelock however have the same order of divergence indicating the same singularity strength .",
    "this happens because for lovelock potential goes as @xmath124 , riemann will go as @xmath201 and the corresponding kretshmann scalar as @xmath202 while for einstein they go respectively as @xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 ( for @xmath1 , @xmath206 ) .",
    "thus even though for a given degree of inhomogeneity , collapse may result in a black hole for einstein and naked singularity for lovelock , yet the kretshmann scalar for both would have the same order of divergence .",
    "this shows that rate of collapse which determines black hole or naked singularity depends upon einstein or lovelock but the ultimate order of divergence of singularity is neutral .",
