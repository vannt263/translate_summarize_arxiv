    "invariance under area preserving diffeomorphisms ( apd ) @xcite is a basic symmetry of ordinary yang - mills theories in two dimensions ( ym@xmath0 ) . thanks to this property",
    ", the theory acquires an almost topological flavor @xcite and , as a consequence , can be solved .",
    "beautiful group - theoretic methods @xcite can be used to obtain exact expressions for the partition function and wilson loop averages . in particular",
    ", explicit solutions of the migdal - makeenko equation @xcite were obtained in two dimensions @xcite for the expectation values of multiply - intersecting wilson loops , due to the circumstance that they depend only on the areas of the windows singled out on the manifold .",
    "the invariance under apd was believed to persist in yang - mills theories defined on a noncommutative two - dimensional manifold ; actually it was believed to play a crucial role in the large gauge group , characteristic of noncommutative theories , which merges internal and space - time transformations .",
    "if this were the case one might expect to be able to solve noncommutative ym@xmath0 by suitably generalizing the powerful geometric procedures employed in the ordinary commutative case .",
    "this was suggested by an intriguing circumstance which occurs when studying the theory on a noncommutative torus . here",
    "one can exploit morita equivalence in order to relate the model to its dual on a commutative torus @xcite where the apd invariance is granted .",
    "the theory on the noncommutative plane is then reached by a suitable limit procedure and one would expect invariance to be preserved there @xcite .",
    "wilson loop perturbative expansions in the coupling constant and in @xmath1 , @xmath2 being the non - commutativity parameter , were performed directly on the noncommutative plane in @xcite .",
    "all the results obtained there , at the orders checked , were consistent with apd invariance , the expressions depending solely on the area .",
    "only recently , the authors of @xcite were able to extend to a higher order ( the @xmath3 term at @xmath4 ) those results , and found different answers for a wilson loop on a circle and on a rectangle of the same area .",
    "their result motivated the systematic investigation presented in @xcite , where wilson loops based on a wide class of contours with the same area are considered .",
    "the main issue of @xcite is that , indeed , invariance under apd is lost even for smooth contours , the breaking being rooted in the non - local nature of the moyal product .",
    "still a residual symmetry survives , precisely the invariance under _ linear _ unimodular transformations ( sl(2,*r * ) ) .",
    "this report is devoted to illustrate the main points of @xcite , which the reader is invited to consult for details and further references .",
    "perturbative evaluations of a wilson loop , according to a well established procedure @xcite , are most easily performed , in two euclidean dimensions , by choosing an axial gauge @xmath5 , @xmath6 being the ( constant ) gauge vector . as a matter of fact in such a gauge",
    "the self - interaction terms are missing and no faddeev - popov determinant is required .",
    "gauge invariance allows to transform the gauge vector @xmath6 by a _ linear _",
    "unimodular transformation @xmath7 , with real entries , namely by an element of sl(2,*r * ) . in turn",
    "this gauge transformation can be traded for a corresponding _ linear _ area preserving deformation of the loop contour , as shown in @xcite . in a noncommutative",
    "setting these transformations belong to the @xmath8 gauge invariance group .",
    "the proof can not be generalized to non - linear deformations , as they would require a non - constant gauge vector , which would in turn conflict with the moyal product .",
    "since the considerations above seem to depend heavily on the axial gauge choice and gauge invariance is explicitly _ assumed _ , it looks interesting to prove the invariance under _ linear _ deformations of the contour _ without changing the gauge vector_. this has been done for the @xmath3 term in the expansion in @xmath9 of the wilson loop at @xmath4 : it was indeed the term considered by the authors in @xcite , where a difference was first noticed between wilson loops of the same area but with different contours ( a circular and a rectangular one ) .",
    "this quantity will in turn be used to prove the breaking of the _ local _ unimodular invariance in the noncommutative context .    the @xmath3 term of the wilson loop , at the perturbative order @xmath10 ,",
    "will be indicated as @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "invariance would imply , for non self - intersecting contours , that @xmath11=k a_c^4 $ ] , where @xmath12 is the area enclosed by the contour @xmath13 , the constant @xmath14 being universal , _",
    "i.e. _ independent of the shape of @xmath13 .    in the axial gauge @xmath15the non - planar contribution to the quantum average of the wilson loop , at the lowest relevant perturbative order @xmath4 , can be computed for a given contour @xmath13 parametrized by @xmath16 $ ] = -20pt [ order-4 ] & & w_4^np = _ 1  _ 4 + & & , where @xmath17 is a unit vector orthogonal to @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is a shorthand for the antisymmetric bilinear in the momenta @xmath20 ; two propagators correspond to four vertices on the wilson line ; and the peculiar phase factor @xmath21 which originates from the noncommutative product , singles out the non - planar contribution .",

    "invariance of the quantum average of a wilson loop under translations is automatic in noncommutative theories owing to the trace integration over space - time ( see also @xcite ) . in @xcite the invariance of eq .   under linear area preserving maps ( elements of sl(2,*r * ) ) is explicitly proven .",

    "in turn the breaking of the invariance under _ local _ , non - linear area preserving maps is explicitly shown , at the perturbative level , for several different contours .",
    "the computation of the wilson loop is in principle straightforward for polygonal contours , since only polynomial integrations are required ; nonetheless , a considerable amount of algebra makes it rather involved .",

    "notice that @xmath57 is positive and the definition of @xmath58 is left unchanged in the covariantized formulation .",
    "the condition [ sym ] s_gen[a , g]=s[a ] would describe a symmetry of the classical action . in @xmath60 , due to the circumstance that @xmath58 is a two - form , we get [ ac ] s[a]=12 f_12 ^ 2 d^2x , while in @xmath54 $ ] the contractions with the inverse metric contribute a factor @xmath61 [ gen ] s_gen[a , g]=12 f_12 ^ 2 d^2x .",
