    "if confirmed , the levy defect pattern would be a surprising phenomenon : upon some  primary democratic  conditions , levy statistics can promote shaping .",
    "the basic physical assumption of our approach is that the levy sum components can be related to spatially separable , dynamically independent subsystems or partial systems .",
    "( such a relation is not necessary , which means that there are levy situations where spatial aspects play a minor role .",
    "an example is the treatment of laser cooling in ref.@xcite , where a trap in the momentum space is considered , and the levy distribution is related to lifetimes such as trapping or escaping times . ) our assumption is completed by a general space vs. mobility scaling of fluctuation modes to treat the spatial structure of the defects .",

    "the mathematics used is based on the classical theorems of darling and feller . the mathematical development along their original proofs is accompanied by physical arguments , because the handling of a probability distribution with nonexistent expectation and variance ( eq .

    "this assumption is justified by the high attempt rate .",
    "if the partial system is not too small , i.e. if the attempt rate inside is still much larger than the rearranging frequency ,    @xmath118    then we find a limit distribution for each partial system .",

    "this is valid also for partial systems in the periphery ( [ eq.3.4 ] ) of the defect .",
    "their contribution to the sum ( general susceptibility ( [ eq.1.2 ] ) ) may be small , nevertheless the movements in these partial systems may become very lively because of the infinite expectation ( [ eq.1.4 ] ) , @xmath121 . any partial system can profit from the possibilities .",
    "it can e.g. take the advantage to use the high frequencies for an effect on the rearrangement , e.g. to become preponderant and get the center : all particles may take part in diffusion .",
    "competition for cooperativity can so be simulated by independent attempts of partial systems . expressed e.g. by the gauss distribution for free volume , large fluctuation of one partial system @xmath27",

    "@xcite , p.222 - 223 ) .",
    "this would decide which alternative for the characteristic length would be consistent with scattering .",
    "the typical glass transition crossover frequency can be reached by dynamic neutron scattering in the next years , if e.g. the impressive series of experiments by dieter richter s group ( e.g. arbe1998,arbe2003,frick1995 ) is continued to lower frequencies .",
    "reliable dynamic calorimetry in the megahertz range , however , remains to be done schickpc2006 .",
    "dynamic photon scattering can probably be applied in the @xmath130-process dispersion zone at low frequencies , a few frequency decades above freezing - in around the glass temperature @xmath232 .",
    "experimental data from dynamic calorimetry is available here @xcite .",
    "the decision for von laue would become a conclusive experimental argument for levy defects , if our treatment from defects to von laue thermodynamics has a robust reversal . this includes three main steps : ( 1 ) freely fluctuating subsystems should give a sound thermodynamic basis for the components of a levy sum with levy exponent @xmath5 ( representativeness theorem ) .",
    "in particular , such equivalent subsystems should give a thermodynamic basis for the way from kohlrausch correlation functions to the levy sum ( theorem 1 ) .",
    "we need a sound explanation to have a levy instability in the liquid giving @xmath1 ( free volume picture fig .  1 and theorem 2 ) .",
    "i think we can explicitly find the robust reversal in these steps .",
    "there are general consequences for thermodynamics , if the temperature fluctuation at so small , one - nanometer lengths could be confirmed by the experimentum crucis . since we do not have a molecular spatio - temperature field in this length range , i.e. no",
    "@xmath449 there , we can not illustrate temperature fluctuations by additional hydrodynamic arguments using forces and fluxes @xcite .",
    "instead , @xmath367 must be included in the many possibilities of the molecular origin for the random components of a levy sum which is agitated by the high attempt rates of dynamics . instead of hydrodynamics , the levy defect forms some levy diffusion .",
    "temperature fluctuation is there a necessary part of the dynamic molecular play in liquids .",
    "teaching thermodynamics , we could leave the thermodynamic limit for the definition of temperature .",
    "if @xmath251 would be confirmed , then the gibbs distribution comes from a ",
    "static  restriction : we start from a more general thermodynamics for subsystems with @xmath251 and come to the limit @xmath450 with @xmath451 , e.g. by means of a heat reservoir",
    ". the use of this restriction as a basis of the general definition of temperature ( as sometimes advocated @xcite ) would not longer be reasonable .",
    "temperature @xmath226 is essentially different from an energy @xmath452 , irrespective of the frequent occurrence of an equation of type @xmath453 . in liquids ,",
    "such an equation comes from planck s black body radiation of the quantums @xmath454 in nyquist s transmission lines for a thermodynamic measurement , @xmath455 . in the fdt",
    ", this equation connects temperature fluctuations and frequency fluctuations for a specific response , as used above .    in summary , an experimentum crucis which confirms the lengths calculated from von laue thermodynamics would overcome the nonfluctuation of temperature @xmath0",
    "i.e. brings a new ( the old ) definition of temperature in liquids beyond ( and before ) the gibbs definition with the latter s heat reservoir without fluctuation .",
    "the consequence for liquids could be that mechanics and thermodynamics can not be separated into denominator over nominator , ( @xmath456 ) , as for gibbs .",
    "the  statistical mechanics  could be influenced by a thermodynamics with levy defects in the liquid .",
    "then the observables , in particular the dynamic susceptibilities , can not exactly be calculated from mechanical computer simulation plus gibbs thermodynamics alone .",
    "most of the qualitative attributes for the arrangement and properties of the dispersion zones ( @xmath457 ) in the relaxation chart of the dynamic glass transition ( as a synonym of classical liquid dynamics ) can be explained by a weak underlying fluctuating free - volume pattern with strong dynamic levy defects .",
    "eight examples are :    \\(1 ) the levy defect explains the concentration of the main transition ( @xmath133 ) dynamics into a relatively narrow dispersion zone with a half - width of about ( @xmath458 ) decades , with @xmath5 the levy exponent .",
    "the spectral densities for extensive variables are levy distributions , their correlation functions are stretched exponentials .",
    "\\(2 ) the spatial position of the johari goldstein @xmath129 process in the pattern is the center of the glarum levy defect of the @xmath11 process ; the continuous part of the @xmath129 process comes from the cooperative periphery .",
    "\\(3 ) the location of the crossover region in the relaxation chart is defined by virtual crossing of a quasi mechanical molecular barrier mechanisms ( arrhenius process underlying the @xmath129 process ) with the main @xmath133 process being not an arrhenius process .",
    "\\(4 ) the emerging von laue thermodynamics allows an experimental determination of the characteristic length for the main transition by bulk dynamic calorimetry .",
    "this length is the size of minimal representative subsystems and characterizes the size of the glarum levy defects ( including its preponderant component , its fractal center and its cooperative periphery ) and their mutual average distance in the pattern .",
    "\\(5 ) the preponderant component of the @xmath133 levy sum for the defect may induce an extraordinary molecular event of dynamics : the diffusion step through the cage door opened in the cage of equivalent next molecular neighbors .",
    "\\(7 ) the position of the dispersion zone for the fischer modes @xmath132 relative to the main transition in the relaxation chart is determined by the diffusion - relevant levy exponent @xmath11 from the @xmath133 glarum levy defects without the need to refer to any thermodynamic collective structure formation beyond the levy distribution ( no  clusters  ) .",
    "the fischer speckles are the levy defects of a levy sum from a large number of minimal subsystems .",
    "\\(8 ) at low temperatures ( or mobilities ) , the main transition is probably exhausted .",
    "the operational freedom in the periphery for large cooperativities @xmath122 becomes so small that spatially distributed , random traces of foreign processes can take the control over from the main process .",
    "this restricts the levy exponent from below , @xmath460 .    the way from the widely observed stretched exponential ( kohlrausch function ) to a levy distribution for the spatial fluctuation pattern with preponderant components as midst of the defects",
    "is explained by a succession of theorems which are partly known before .",
    "their original mathematical proofs are partly modified and completed by physical arguments and comments .",
    "two things are additionally needed for this way : mathematically , ( 1 ) a sum of levy sum components and ( 2 ) an explanation of small levy exponents @xmath1 .",
    "this corresponds physically ( ad 1 ) to a sum of spatially separable statistically independent subsystems or partial systems and ( ad 2 ) to a levy instability from a local breakthrough of mobility .",
    "the latter is characterized by more free volume in the center as well as a spectrum of relaxation in the cooperative periphery of the defect .",
    "this  inside explanation  is confirmed by an  outside ",
    "one from the representativeness theorem for thermodynamics of liquids , operating with a sum of representative minimal subsystems .",
    "an experimentum crucis for the whole argumentation is suggested : the comparison of characteristic lengths from thermodynamics ( dynamic calorimetry ) with lengths from dynamic neutron ( or photon ) scattering .",
    "the levy distribution gets a  shaping power of statistics  if it is imbedded in certain additional circumstances . for the dynamics in classical liquids ,",
    "e.g. , the following is sufficient : ( a ) .",
    "many equivalent independent spatially separable partial systems for its establishment as a limit distribution , ( b ) .",
    "an instability whose stabilization by the limit distribution is different from gauss ( exponent @xmath71 , in particular @xmath84 for the existence of a preponderant component in the levy sum ) , and ( c ) . a general time ( mobility)-length scaling of relevant fluctuation modes to get a fluctuating space pattern with defects .",
    "the latter are thus considered as the results of the shaping power .",
