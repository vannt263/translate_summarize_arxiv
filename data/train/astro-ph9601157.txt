    "much work has been done over the past twenty - five years on the low - frequency radio emission detected from pulsars , in large part due to the huge volume of data available . in the last decade , however , attention has been turning toward the high end of the emission spectrum , as more reliable data become available ( see , for example , grenier et al 1993 and masnou et al 1994 ) .    the main problem in developing a theoretical model of the pulsar magnetosphere",
    "is the complexity of finding a self - consistent solution to the set of equations defining the electromagnetic fields and particle densities and velocities as functions of time .",
    "theoretical attemps to model the high - energy emission generally make assumptions about the global structure of the magnetosphere , and then restrict their attention to local sites where large electric fields parallel to the magnetic field lines accelerate charges .",
    "the two most developed examples are the polar cap model of daugherty & harding ( 1994 ) and the outer gap model created by cheng , ho , & ruderman ( 1986 ) and further developed by chiang & romani ( 1994 ) .",
    "we make a set of assumptions about the global magnetospheric structure that differs from past models : we assume that the charge density is very small in the outer magnetosphere , and that the pulsar can be treated as a spinning , highly magnetised and conducting sphere in vacuum ( the electromagnetic fields around such a star were derived by deutsch 1955 ) .",
    "this assumption is justified in our model because we find that any charges created in the inner magnetosphere follow paths constrained to stay close to the star .",
    "they are thus unable to populate the outer magnetosphere and short out the electric fields ( the distinction between the inner and outer magnetosphere is elaborated in section  [ sec - particle_motion ] ) .    by so fixing the fields , particle motion can be integrated relatively easily , and the radiation observed from the model pulsar",
    "can be estimated fairly accurately . with low number densities ,",
    "inverse compton scattering and photon / photon interactions are unlikely , and synchrotron emission is not important , so curvature radiation is the only source of emission .",
    "the back reaction on the particles of the curvature emission is included in the determining the particle energies .",
    "an approximation to the particle motion in strong fields in developed which is applicable in all realistic pulsar magnetospheres where gamma - ray production is efficient .",
    "the approximation is used to simplify our numerical integration , but is general enough that it may find application in other models of the pulsar magnetosphere .    in this paper ( paper i ) , the basic characteristics of the model will be examined .",
    "higgins & henriksen ( 1996 ) ( hereafter paper ii ) will apply the model to the known high - energy pulsars , consider how the model pulsar ages , and estimate the number of high - energy pulsars that should be found in gamma - ray surveys .",
    "by fixing the electromagnetic fields , the problem of calculating the radiation pattern changes from a system of partial differential equations to a system of ordinary differential equations , and becomes much more tractable .",
    "the deutsch fields look like the fields of a spinning magnetic point dipole at radii much larger than the stellar radius , with wrapped - up magnetic field lines outside the light cylinder and large components of electric field parallel to the magnetic field . inside the star the electric field is frozen - in , and this boundary condition at the stellar surface significantly perturbs the fields near the star .",
    "field lines in the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis for the orthogonal deutsch fields ( when the magnetic dipole moment is perpendicular to the rotation axis ) near the light cylinder are shown in figure  [ fig - deutsch_closed ] for selected closed field lines and figure  [ fig - deutsch_open ] for open field lines .",
    "four parameters entirely characterise these fields : the angular velocity of the star @xmath0 , the radius of the star @xmath1 , the magnitude of the effective magnetic dipole moment @xmath2 , and the inclination @xmath3 of the dipole moment with respect to the rotation axis .",
    "an estimate of the electric and magnetic field strength is useful for the calculation of various quantities ; the order of magnitude of the electric and magnetic fields near the light cylinder is approximately    @xmath4    the vacuum approximation holds as long as the charge densities and current densities give negligible perturbations to the fields .",
    "this is true when the charge density is much less than the goldreich - julian charge density :    @xmath5    where the fields are frozen - in . here",
    ", @xmath6 is the angular velocity of the star and @xmath7 is the magnetic field at the point in question .",
    "this corresponds approximately to a number density :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the radius of the light cylinder . note the strong variation with the angular velocity of the star ;",
    "a relatively small charge density at the light cylinder of a slow pulsar can alter the fields .",
    "the fields far from the star look like a spherically - propagating electromagnetic wave with frequency equal to the rotational frequency of the star .",
    "this radiation removes rotational energy from the star , slowing it with time .",
    "therefore , the effective magnetic dipole moment of the deutsch fields can be estimated from the period and period derivative of the pulsar rotation :    @xmath10    the moment of inertia of neutron stars is unknown by up to a factor of 10 depending on the equation of state ; this introduces some uncertainty into the calculation of the effective magnetic dipole moment .",
    "this result is similar to that of magnetodipole radiation from a point dipole derived by ostriker & gunn ( 1969 ) , since the deutsch fields only differ from the point dipole fields near the star .",
    "this model assumes that the only emission contributing to the light curves is a result of curvature radiation by the high - energy particles moving along curved paths in the magnetosphere .",
    "this is justified as long as the number densities are small ; how small can be roughly calculated by examining the mean free path of photons subject to compton scattering off electrons and to self - scattering .",
    "the cross - section for compton scattering ( or inverse compton scattering ) is approximately equal to the thompson scattering cross - section for photon energies in the electron rest frame much less than the electron rest mass . for photon energies in this frame much greater than the electron rest mass ,",
    "the cross - section is approximately @xmath11 ( jackson ( 1975 ) ) .",
    "therefore , the thompson cross - section will be used as an upper limit to the cross - section ( although this neglects resonant interactions with the magnetic field , which can increase the cross - section by several orders of magnitude above the thompson value for a limited energy range - see , for example , daugherty & harding 1991 ) .",
    "the optical depth of the magnetosphere to inverse compton scattering for a photon is then approximately    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is an average electron density , @xmath14 @xmath15 is the thompson scattering cross - section , and @xmath9 is the light cylinder radius .    the number density of photons in the magnetosphere can be roughly estimated from the power output of each electron @xmath16 , the average photon energy @xmath17 , and the characteristic time the photons are within the magnetosphere @xmath18 as    @xmath19    to ensure that the number of photons which scatter off electrons is much less than the number of electrons ,    @xmath20    this puts a limit on the number density of electrons of    @xmath21    for relativistic motion on a path with radius of curvature @xmath22 , the power and average frequency of curvature emission can be written ( e.g. , jackson 1975 )    @xmath23    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the charge s lorentz factor and @xmath26 its charge .    substituting these into inequality  ( [ eq - number ] ) ,",
    "@xmath27    the lorentz factor of particles can be estimated from the fields ( see equation  ( [ eq - lorentz ] ) ) by equating the power output from radiation with the power input from the electric field .",
    "roughly , this gives    @xmath28    this can be used to define an upper limit to a combination of the stellar parameters below which this model remains applicable by setting the golreich - julian number density equal to the limit of equation  ( [ eq - ne_limit ] ) ( the number densities must always be much less than the golreich - juliann number density ) . using the expression for @xmath25 above , the condition for neglible scattering is    @xmath29    for example , with a magnetic dipole moment of @xmath30 g @xmath31 ( giving a surface magnetic field of approximately @xmath32 g ) , the upper limit on @xmath0 is approximately 5000 rad / s , much larger than any standard pulsar spin rates .",
    "thus , for the population of normal pulsars , the goldreich - julian number density is not sufficient to ensure significant compton scattering .",
    "a similar calculation can be done for the case of photon - photon scattering , where the cross - section above the pair production limit is again maximally of order the thompson cross - section . for the spectrum to remain unperturbed as it leaves the magnetosphere ,    @xmath33    where @xmath34 .",
    "this gives exactly the same constraint on the electron number density and on the angular velocity and dipole moment ( equation  ( [ eq - compton ] ) ) as the inverse compton scattering criterion above .",
    "while the fraction of photons affected by photon - photon scattering is rather small , the photons which do interact create charges in the magnetosphere .",
    "this could provide a source for the charges , though a more complex calculation is required to properly examine the viability of this option .",
    "a key approximation of the model ( see section  [ sec - dfb ] ) is that charges move parallel to the magnetic field line in a frame where the electric and magnetic fields are parallel .",
    "therefore , in the framework of the model , there is no contribution at all from synchrotron radiation .",
    "the results of simulating particle motion under this approximation have been compared to those found in a full - blown simulation of the particle motion where the approximation is relaxed .",
    "the two calculations agree remarkably well whenever the fields and energies are large enough to produce significant amounts of radiation .",
    "the numerical integration of the charged particle motion in the simulations is simplified enormously under the application of a key assumption in this work , labelled the drift frame bead - on - a - wire ( dfb ) approximation .",
    "we assume that , in a frame where the electric field is parallel to the magnetic field , the charge has a velocity directed parallel or antiparallel to @xmath7 with magnitude approximately equal to @xmath35 ; the velocity in the pulsar rest frame at any point can then be determined by boosting back to the original frame of reference .",
    "consider a point in the magnetosphere with electric field @xmath36 and magnetic field @xmath7 .",
    "define the @xmath37-axis to be parallel to @xmath7 , and @xmath36 to have components only in the @xmath37 and @xmath38 directions .",
    "there is a boost of @xmath39 which defines a frame of reference where @xmath40 is parallel to @xmath41 as long as the electric field is not perpendicular to the magnetic field _ and _ equal in magnitude ( primed quantities are those in the boosted frame ) .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig - eb_fig ] ; the boost can be shown to be    @xmath42    where all the quantities relate to the pulsar rest frame .",
    "this is valid for @xmath43 or @xmath44 , and even @xmath45 as long as the two are not perpendicular .",
    "we assume that , in this frame , the velocity of the charge is either parallel or anti - parallel to @xmath41 ( depending on the sign of @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the particle s charge ) and that the particle is ultra - relativistic , so its speed is nearly @xmath35 . boosting back to the initial frame , the charge s velocity is then    @xmath48    where @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the expression is exact , given the assumption about the particle motion in the boosted frame of reference .    given an initial position , the charge s motion is now defined by the solution to a set of three first - order ordinary differential equations @xmath51 , which can be solved numerically with relative ease . the particle s energy can be found by integrating the power input due to the electric field and the power output due to the radiation loss . the simulations of particle motion under this approximation have been compared to those when the dfb approximation is relaxed in a more sophisticated ( and time - consuming ) simulation and are found to match very closely for all the known gamma - ray pulsars ( the constraint on the applicability of the dfb approximation is considered below ) .    it is generally found that , since the fields are so large , the radiation reaction force acts like a thermostat , balancing the energy input from the electric force with the energy output due to radiation .",
    "this gives a convenient description of the particle s energy at any point ,    @xmath52    where the radiative power output was taken as equation  ( [ eq - rad_power ] ) .",
    "the whole approximation is only valid where the timescale to radiate away the momentum perpendicular to the field direction is much less than the timescale @xmath18 over which the fields vary significantly ; this reduces to another constraint on @xmath0 and @xmath2 :    @xmath53    for a typical @xmath54 g @xmath31 , this gives @xmath55 rad / s , which is true for all the observed gamma - ray pulsars .",
    "three different types of particle motion were observed in the simulations .",
    "some charges follow open paths and escape to infinity , radiating quite powerfully inside the magnetosphere ; these are labelled `` outgoing '' paths",
    ". the second and third types of path are closed within the inner magnetosphere .",
    "charges on the second type of path follow a course which directs them into the star ; on the third variety , the charge paths attempt to cross a surface where @xmath56 goes to zero .",
    "particles encountering such a `` null surface '' lose their energy almost immediately since the radiation power output is no longer balanced by an energy input from the electric field . any charge encountering a null surface is forced to remain on it ; the electric field switches sign on either side of the surface , effectively trapping the particle .",
    "they can travel out of the magnetosphere on these surfaces at relatively low energies without contributing to the observed radiation , but perhaps establishing the required charge balance for the steady - state magnetosphere .",
    "these surfaces then are not so much `` gaps '' as `` conduits '' for low - energy plasma .",
    "which type of path a charge will follow depends on its starting position .",
    "the fraction of paths which are outgoing drops to zero at a radius of approximately @xmath57 ; _ all _ the charges inside this radius are bound to the inner magnetosphere , except those on the surface with @xmath58 , which can escape the magnetosphere but at very low energies .",
    "this defines the boundary between the inner and outer magnetosphere : inside the inner magnetosphere , all particle paths are bound .",
    "this constitutes our justification of the evacuated nature of the magnetosphere ; charges created ( presumably due to @xmath59 pair creation near the star ) will not be able to populate the outer magnetosphere , since they are locked into bound orbits .",
    "we take the bound charges into account by increasing the effective stellar radius to @xmath57 . in doing so ,",
    "the charges remain bound , even though the field structure changes to become `` frozen - in '' .    when charges are started relatively far inside the magnetosphere , but outside @xmath57 , most of the paths are still bound , and the outgoing paths extend from a small region near one of the poles ( which one depends on the sign of the charge of the particle ) .",
    "with this justification of the vacuum assumption for the magnetosphere , the basic model can be defined as a rough approximation to a global self - consistent solution to the pulsar problem .",
    "the outer magnetosphere ( @xmath60 ) is the region of particle acceleration , where charges can be ejected from the magnetosphere .",
    "the only radiation which is important is curvature radiation , for the reasons discussed earlier .",
    "particles radiate gamma - ray photons , some toward the star , where they create electron - positron pairs on the powerful magnetic fields in the inner magnetosphere .",
    "these charges are all bound on closed paths to the inner magnetosphere , and can not populate the outer magnetosphere to short out the large electric fields .",
    "a charge balance is established by having charges being created near the star and flowing out with low energies along the null surfaces .",
    "the effect of the outflowing charges on the fields is neglected .",
    "since the paths of the charges are all bound for radii @xmath61 , charges were started on a sphere of radius @xmath62 ( called the `` starting sphere '' ) at intervals of @xmath63 radians in the toroidal and poloidal angles to fully sample the range of initial starting positions .",
    "the starting energies were unimportant , since the charges immediately move to balance radiation power out with electric field power in .",
    "the source for these charges is left undetermined .",
    "the radiation from these trajectories was calculated and binned to build up light curves and spectra for different viewing directions ; this is discussed in detail in sections  [ sec - lc_gen ] and  [ sec - spectra ]    to simplify the numerical calculation , we took advantage of three symmetries of the problem .",
    "first , there is a symmetry ( symmetry 1 ) in the fields @xmath64 and @xmath65 under a translation @xmath66 , @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the poloidal angle and @xmath69 is the toroidal angle relative to the rotation axis .",
    "therefore , if a charge @xmath47 started at @xmath70 follows the path @xmath71 , the same charge started at @xmath72 will take the path @xmath73 .",
    "the symmetry applies for any orientation of the dipole moment to the rotation axis .",
    "the second symmetry ( symmetry 2 ) is between charges of different sign , but only applies when the dipole axis is perpendicular to the rotation axis .",
    "the path of a charge @xmath74 started at @xmath75 is equal to the path of a charge @xmath47 started at @xmath76 rotated through 180 degrees toroidally .    the third symmetry ( symmetry 3 ) is a result of another property of the fields , that @xmath77 equals @xmath78 rotated through an angle @xmath79 in @xmath69 .",
    "this means that a charge @xmath47 started at @xmath80 will follow the path of a charge @xmath47 started at @xmath81 rotated through @xmath82 toroidally .",
    "this symmetry holds for any orientation of the dipole moment .",
    "symmetry 1 means than runs need be done only for particle starting points in the top half of the magnetosphere ; paths in the bottom half are reflections of those in the top half .",
    "a consequence of symmetry 3 is that charges started at a time @xmath83 not equal to zero can be found from the paths started at @xmath84 by a rotation azimuthally .",
    "symmetry 2 means that positron paths can be inferred from electron paths , but only in the orthogonal deutsch fields .",
    "the combination of symmetry 2 and symmetry 3 has an important consequence for the inferred light curves when the dipole moment is perpendicular to the rotation axis : positrons will radiate in exactly the same manner as electrons , but a half period later .",
    "if the electron contribution is a single peak , the positrons will contribute a second peak , exactly 0.5 later in phase , if the distribution of positrons is equal to that of electrons in the magnetosphere .",
    "this does not hold for non - orthogonal systems , as symmetry 2 is broken .",
    "with paths of all the charges known , a pattern of radiative emission for different retarded times @xmath85 ( @xmath86 , with @xmath87 a unit vector pointing toward the observer ) could be generated .",
    "a numerical routine stepped along the paths for each of the different starting angles , and for 100 steps in starting angle @xmath83 .",
    "the emission from paths in the bottom half of the magnetosphere ( and for positron paths when considering orthogonal fields ) was included by inferring their paths from the three symmetries discussed earlier .",
    "since the emission generated is only for a single electron started at @xmath88 on the starting sphere and at time @xmath83 , the power must be scaled by a distribution function @xmath89 of charges over the starting sphere and over starting time , where @xmath90 is the number of charges ( either electrons or positrons ) flowing through the starting sphere between solid angle @xmath0 and @xmath91 at times between @xmath83 and @xmath92 .",
    "this distribution function can be varied to model different sources ; however , since most emission comes from the outgoing paths , which only originate on a small region of the starting sphere , changes in @xmath89 do not much affect the light curves . throughout this work ,",
    "@xmath93 for the light curve generation ; the actual value of @xmath94 is constrained by the total power emitted by the pulsar , and sets the number density at the starting sphere .",
    "the spectrum of the radiation at one point along a path , for a given particle lorentz factor and path radius of curvature , is assumed to be instanteously that for circular motion ; this is discussed in section  [ sec - spectra ] the emitted radiation was calculated at several different frequencies to capture the spectrum at each time on the light curve .",
    "the emitted power was binned into angular bins of @xmath63 radians in azimuthal and polodial viewing angles , bins of @xmath95 in @xmath85 ( where @xmath96 is the pulsar period ) , and bins of 0.25 in @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the photon energy .",
    "any emission which was beamed through the inner magnetosphere ( @xmath61 ) was not included in the light curves , as it was assumed to have been absorbed in the denser plasma near the star .",
    "figure  [ fig - rep_curve ] shows some representative 1 mev light curves generated by the model , which cover many of the variations seen in the observed gamma - ray pulsar light curves .",
    "plots ( a ) and ( b ) correspond to a geminga - like pulsar , with an angular velocity of @xmath99 rad / s and a magnetic dipole moment of @xmath54 g @xmath31 aligned perpendicular to the rotation axis .",
    "the first is for a viewing angle of @xmath100 , and the second represents radiation into @xmath101 .",
    "these show the characteric symmetry between the first and second halves of the light curve due to the action of symmetry 2 in the orthogonal field .",
    "light curve ( c ) is for the same geminga - like pulsar , but with the dipole moment inclined at 45@xmath102 to the rotation axis , seen at a viewing angle of 73@xmath102 .",
    "the two main peaks are separated by a phase of 0.45 .",
    "( d ) , ( e ) , and ( f ) all correspond to emission from a vela - like pulsar , with @xmath103 rad / s and @xmath104 g @xmath31 .",
    "the dipole moment in ( d ) and ( e ) is nearly aligned at only 11.25@xmath102 to the rotation axis ; ( f ) corresponds to orthogonal fields .",
    "( d ) represents emission into a viewing angle of 16.9@xmath102 , and shows a well - defined single peak .",
    "( e ) is seen from a viewing angle of 61.9@xmath102 and shows three quite well - defined peaks ( there is a suggestion of a triply - peaked light curve for psr b1706 - 44 - thompson et al , 1995 ) .",
    "( f ) is seen from a viewing angle of @xmath105 , and shows no discernable pulsation at frequencies less than 50 gev .",
    "this pulsar would likely be missed in a pulsar survey .",
    "all the plots discussed relate to emission beamed into @xmath106 ; one of the poles points toward the observer at @xmath107 at this angle .",
    "the light curves for @xmath108 are identical except for a phase change .",
    "for all these plots , the radio emission peaks ( presumed to come from the poles near the star ) would be seen at @xmath109 and/or @xmath110 ; the gamma - ray peaks are significantly displaced in some cases , while in others they align quite closely .",
    "the total power emitted into all directions by the electrons or positrons at any time @xmath111 is given by :    @xmath112 d \\omega d t_0\\ ] ]    where @xmath113 is the power output of one electron ( e ) or positron ( p ) at time @xmath114 along the path , started at @xmath88 on the starting sphere at time @xmath83 .",
    "@xmath115 are the distribution functions of charges on the starting sphere , which is not fixed in the model .",
    "if the total high - energy power output of a pulsar is known , this fact can be used to estimate the number density of charges at the starting sphere required to supply that energy .",
    "if this number density is larger than the goldreich - julian number density , the fields will be altered and the model will break down .    taking a constant distribution @xmath93 ,",
    "the total energy radiated in one period is given by    @xmath116    since the radiation reaction force fixes the radiated power to be very closely equal to the power input from the electric field ,    @xmath117    where @xmath118 is a dimensionless electric field which no longer depends on the values of @xmath2 and @xmath0 , and @xmath119 .",
    "defining @xmath120 and @xmath121 , the total energy emitted in a period can now be written    @xmath122    where @xmath123 is a dimensionless function of the dipole inclination angle @xmath3 alone :    @xmath124    for example , @xmath125 for the orthogonal fields , and 6.8 for @xmath126 .    since the total gamma - ray power output from the model must be constant with time , the total energy emitted in a period is equal to @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the observed gamma - ray power .",
    "the value of @xmath94 can then be related to the observed power output :    @xmath129    the value of @xmath94 sets the number density at the starting sphere required to produce the observed power output , since @xmath130 .",
    "therefore ,    @xmath131    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the number density can be described somewhat more meaningfully as a fraction of the goldreich - julian number density ( equation  ( [ eq - gj ] ) ) at the starting sphere ( @xmath123 is taken to be equal to 36 , the value for the orthogonal fields ) .",
    "@xmath132    this quantity is tabulated in table  1 for the known gamma - ray pulsars , and is less than unity , and therefore consistent with the model , in all cases .",
    "the values of @xmath2 were calculated with equation  ( [ eq - mu_est ] ) taking @xmath133 ( and are therefore a lower limit ) .",
    "the most serious problem with this model is its inability to _ predict _ the total power output ; instead , it is only shown that the observed power outputs require number densities less than the golreich - julian number density , and therefore are consistent with the assumption of vacuum around the star .",
    "the source of the charge on the starting sphere is left unexplained .",
    "the gamma - ray efficiency of a pulsar is defined as the ratio of the power output in gamma - rays to the total energy loss . for the deutsch field pulsar ,",
    "the rate of rotational energy loss is    @xmath134    and the gamma - ray power emitted in our model is given by    @xmath135    setting @xmath125 ( orthogonal fields ) and writing @xmath136 in terms of the goldreich - julian number density @xmath137 , the gamma - ray efficiency is    @xmath138    here , the number density has been written as a fraction of the goldreich - julian number density ; the gamma - ray efficiency only depends on this ratio , not on the pulsar properties directly .",
    "as @xmath139 approaches unity , so does the gamma - ray efficiency .",
    "this is seen in the cases of geminga and psr1055 - 52 , where the observations suggest that @xmath140 ( mayer - hasselwander et al 1994 , fierro et al 1993 ) .",
    "the emission is not beamed equally into all directions .",
    "figure  [ fig - angular ] shows the emission ( averaged over a period ) at 1 mev as a function of the viewing angle ( @xmath141 to 90@xmath102 ) for two vela - like pulsars : one with orthogonal fields ( solid line ) and the other with a dipole inclination of 11.25@xmath102 ( dashed line ) .",
    "the power is scaled to unity at the maximum .",
    "the fraction of the total solid angle into which the power is beamed can be quantified in terms of a power - weighted average :    @xmath142    where @xmath0 represents solid angle , not the angular velocity of the pulsar .",
    "figure  [ fig - om_var ] shows @xmath143 as a function of frequency for a geminga - like pulsar with a dipole moment inclined at 22.5@xmath102 to the rotation axis . a general trend to lower @xmath143 ( and therefore less observable pulsars )",
    "is seen for increasing frequency , with a much faster dropoff above the break in the spectrum ( near several hundred mev ) .",
    "similar results are obtained for pulsars with different model parameters .",
    "since curvature radiation is the only contribution to the light curves , the frequency distribution of curvature emission by a single particle moving instantaneously in circular motion must be considered ( see , for example , jackson ( 1975 ) ) .",
    "the shape of the curve depends on only two parameters - the energy of maximum intensity ( @xmath144 , where @xmath25 is the charge s lorentz factor , @xmath35 is the speed of light , and @xmath22 is the radius of curvature of the particle s path ) , and the maximum intensity . for energies much less than @xmath145 ,",
    "the number distribution in frequency is proportional to @xmath146 ; above @xmath145 , the curve drops off exponentially , and essentially disappears for @xmath147 .",
    "this function is plotted in figure  [ fig - single_part_spec ] .    at low frequencies , therefore , each part of the light curve will fall off in photon number like @xmath146 , and the shape of the light curve will remain essentially constant . at higher frequencies ,",
    "the contributions from particles radiating with different @xmath145 s will result in a light curve which is variable with frequency .",
    "if several different locations in the magnetosphere make significant contributions to the power , the shape of the spectrum can deviate significantly from the single - particle spectrum .",
    "figure  [ fig - rep_spectra ] shows several different time - averaged spectra from model pulsars , all with @xmath148 g @xmath31 , @xmath149 , and seen from a viewing angle of @xmath150 .",
    "spectra for pulsars with three different angular velocities are shown : @xmath151 rad / s , 75 rad / s , and 150 rad / s .",
    "the slow pulsar shows a very hard spectrum with an energy break near several gev , but relatively featureless otherwise .",
    "the 75 rad / s pulsar shows a slight softening of the spectrum near a few hundred mev , and then returning to a hard profile until an energy break near 100 gev .",
    "the 150 rad / s pulsar has a significantly harder spectrum with no break even through the tev region .",
    "it is interesting to note that the photon flux for all three pulsars is relatively constant in the 100 mev range even though the total power outputs vary considerably .",
    "figure  [ fig - spec_plot ] shows time - averaged spectra for an orthogonal field , geminga - like pulsar with a dipole moment of @xmath30 g @xmath31 at a viewing direction of @xmath100 . the spectrum does change slightly with viewing angle , though the major features ( location of the energy break and the shape of the spectrum ) are roughly the same .",
    "data from mayer - hasselwander et al 1994 are shown in the interval 40 mev to 6.3 gev ; the theoretical curve has been shifted vertically on the plot to best fit the data .",
    "the different regions of the light curve can have somewhat different spectral properties .",
    "figure  [ fig - curve_and_spec ] shows the light curve  ( c ) from figure  [ fig - rep_curve ] separated into four components .",
    "the components correspond roughly to the peaks at low energy ( 1 mev ) , shown in ( a ) , and the high - energy ( 10 gev ) peaks , which fall at phases of zero and 0.5 .",
    "the phase of the gamma - ray peak tends to change with energy when the energies are close to the energy break if it is significantly different from the phase of the radio peak .",
    "this occurs because the emission of highest frequency comes from particles moving nearest to the star , where the fields are larger . as the energy increases past the break , the peaks tend to move into phase with the radio peaks , since both are coming from relatively close to the star near the poles .",
    "this alignment of gamma - ray phase with radio phase at high frequencies is a provable prediction of the model , given the presumed location of radio emission .",
    "it is difficult to see this effect in the present observations , since the phase change only happens at very high frequencies ( typically above 10 gev ) . however , if the low - energy gamma peaks are not aligned with the radio peaks , it does lead to the `` interpulse '' regions at low energy having harder spectra and higher energy breaks than the low - energy pulses , as is seen , for example , in the case of the vela pulsar ( kanbach et al 1994 ) .",
    "generally the low - energy spectral index of @xmath152 is harder than observed in the x - ray region for those pulsars where this has been measured .",
    "however , this is precisely the region where the model begins to break down , and radiation from other areas ( such as the inner magnetosphere , where unperturbed curvature radiation likely is not the dominant contribution to the spectrum ) becomes important .",
    "a new model of high - energy pulsar emission has been presented , with the simplifying assumption that the charge densities and current densities are small enough that the electromagnetic fields can be represented by the deutsch fields in the outer magnetosphere .",
    "the assumption that the magnetosphere can remain evacuated is justified by recognising that charges created near the star follow paths bound to the inner magnetosphere , and can not short out the fields farther out .",
    "we create an approximate self - consistent global solution to the electromagnetic fields and charge motions by extending the `` stellar '' radius ( inside which the fields are frozen - in ) to 0.1 of the light cylinder radius ; charge created in the inner magnetosphere can flow out along null surfaces where the electric field is perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "the outer magnetosphere is the location of particle acceleration and high - energy emission .",
    "an important approximation has been developed to chart particle motion in fields where the timescale required to adjust to the field direction is much less than the timescale to radiate away the charge s momentum perpendicular to the magnetic field , called the drift frame bead - on - a - wire ( dfb ) approximation .",
    "this reduces the problem of particle motion to a simple first order , ordinary set of differential equations , reducing computation time enormously .",
    "this approximation could prove useful for developing global , self - consistent models of the pulsar magnetosphere , as it gives a relatively simple description of charge paths in terms of the electric and magnetic fields .",
    "several constraints on the applicability of the model can be made , the most important of which is that the number density required to produce the observed power output must be much less than the goldreich - julian charge density .",
    "all observed gamma - ray pulsars satisfy this constraint , as well as that which maintains the dominance of curvature radiation to the high - energy spectrum in the model framework and that which maintains the applicability of the dfb approximation .",
    "the light curves generated from the model match the general properties of the observed light curves quite well . when the magnetic dipole moment is orthogonal to the rotation axis , the light curves are mainly double - peaked ; the second half of the light curve is identical to the first",
    ". other inclinations can give single peaks , non - symmetric double peaks , and triple peaks , as well as practically unpulsed emission in some cases .",
    "the biggest weakness of the model is its present inability to predict the actual power output of the pulsars in gamma - rays : it does not assume any value for the number density at the starting sphere , only that it be much less than the goldreich - julian number density so that the electric fields are not shorted out",
    ". it also says nothing about any radiation produced in the inner , bound magnetosphere , where particle energies will be somewhat lower than those in the outer , evacuated magnetosphere",
    ". this might provide significant emission at lower energies .",
    "our model compares quite favourably with the other popular models for pulsar gamma - ray emission .",
    "the spectra predicted by our model match the observations in some cases better than those generated by the outer gap model of chiang & romani ( 1994 ) , and as well as those presented for the extended polar cap model of daugherty & harding ( 1995 ) .",
    "our model also has the potential to generate more complex light curves than either the outer gap or polar cap models , which can only produce single or double peaks .",
    "however , this is something of a double - edged sword , as a random sample of light curves would be somewhat less regular than is observed .",
    "this work has introduced the general deutsch field gamma - ray pulsar model ; applications of the model to the known gamma - ray pulsars are developed in paper ii , which also considers several statistical properties of a population of these pulsars ."
