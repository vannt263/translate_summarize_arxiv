    "the published literature on the photometric variability of t  tauri stars now extends back in time more than 150 years ( schmidt 1861 , 1866 ) , predating by nearly 100 years the general acceptance that t associations are sites of recent / current star formation ( salpeter 1954 , ambartsumian 1954 ) , and therefore that the photometric variability of t  tauri stars is likely a signpost of youth ( walker 1956 ) .",
    "haro & herbig ( 1955 ) and walker ( 1956 ) discovered that many of the photometrically variable t  tauri stars also had uv excesses and abnormally weak photospheric absorption lines ( now usually described as spectral  veiling \" ) ; the former authors concluded that the uv excesses might originate from a small hot spot on or near the stellar photosphere .",
    "however , it was not until the 1970s that the modern paradigm for young stellar objects ( ysos ) began to develop , first by linking the photospheric hotspots to accretion from a disk ( walker 1972 ; wolf , appenzeller & bertout 1977 ) , and eventually by having the accretion stream be channeled by magnetic field lines connecting the star and inner disk ( ghosh & lamb 1978 ; knigl 1991 )    based on photometry derived from visual observations or photographic plates , joy ( 1945 ) made photometric variability one of the defining characteristics of the t  tauri class of stars . only the largest amplitude variables could be identified with those techniques .",
    "the modern era in the study of the photometric variability of t  tauri stars began in the 1980s in a series of papers by herbst and his students ( herbst et al .",
    "1982 , 1987 ; holtzman , herbst & booth 1986 ) and by vrba and his collaborators ( rydgren & vrba 1983 ; vrba et al .",
    "1986 , 1989 ) .",
    "they showed that very young stars often have spotted photospheres , allowing their rotation periods to be derived ( which showed that many of them are rapidly rotating relative to the sun , as had long been known from spectroscopy , e.g. , walker 1956 ) . in many cases ,",
    "the data were compatible with cold spots as found on the sun ; however , in some cases  particularly when photometry over a broad wavelength range was available ",
    "the data were best fit by spots hotter than the stellar photosphere , confirming the speculation of haro & herbig ( 1955 ) .",
    "other t  tauri stars instead showed apparently chaotic ( or at least aperiodic ) variability .",
    "herbst et al .  ( 1994 ) summarized the existing data on t tauri variability , and proposed sorting the light curves into several physically motivated classes :    * type i - light curves resulting from stable , long - lived cold spots that are not distributed in an axisymmetric way over the stellar photosphere .",
    "the resultant light curves are periodic , and persist with little change often for months to years ; * type ii - light curves dominated by relatively short lived hot spots .",
    "often these do not show obvious periodicity , indicating that the hot spots evolve significantly on timescales less than the stellar rotation period ; * type iip - hot spot light curves where the spot lifetime is instead comparable or larger than the stellar rotation period , resulting in more or less periodic variations  but which generally evolve rapidly ; * type iii - young stars with large amplitude flux variations in their light curves which are not accompanied by significant variations in the veiling inferred from spectroscopy . the physical interpretation of this class was uncertain , though the leading candidate was extinction by clumps of dust ( most plausibly connected to structures in the inner circumstellar disk ) .    in the past two decades , time series photometry in star forming",
    "regions has been used primarily to determine rotation periods in order to study the initial angular momentum distribution for low mass stars ( herbst et al .",
    "2000 ; rebull 2001 ; lamm et al .  2005 ; moraux et al .",
    "those programs have been quite successful , with rotation periods now known for more than a thousand low mass stars with ages less than a few myr .",
    "some programs have continued to attempt to characterize yso variability not due to spots ( e.g. carpenter , hillenbrand and skrutskie 2001 ) , including a series of campaigns aimed at a particularly intriguing yso ",
    "aa  tau ( bouvier et al .  1999 ; terquem & papaloizou 2000 ; bouvier et al .",
    "based on intensive ground - based time series photometry and spectroscopy over several years , the latter set of papers provided evidence that the light curve for aa  tau is dominated by variable extinction caused by a warped inner disk periodically intersecting our line of sight .",
    "more recently , using three weeks of continuous , high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) photometry from the corot satellite , alencar et al .  ( 2010 ) showed that many of the classical t  tauri stars ( ctts ) in the star - forming region ngc  2264 have light curves similar to aa  tau , indicating that variable extinction from structures in the circumstellar disk passing through our line of sight is common .",
    "this paper is based on a number of observational efforts organized around a spitzer space telescope exploration science program entitled  a coordinated , synoptic investigation of star - formation in ngc  2264 \" ( aka csi  2264 ) .",
    "csi  2264 combines simultaneous or contemporaneous time series observations of the entire ngc  2264 star - forming region spanning a wide range in wavelength and including both photometry and spectroscopy .",

    "the goal of this paper is to illustrate in more detail the characteristics of the stars with stochastic optical light curves , and to propose a physical mechanism for their variability . in  2 , we give a brief listing of the observational data obtained as part of the csi  2264 program . in  3 , we identify a set of seventeen ctts whose light curves we consider to exemplify the stochastic class , we provide additional empirical data for these stars , and we compare their properties to other ctts members of ngc  2264 .",

    "as noted in  1 and in cody et al .

    "those light curves resemble model light curves produced by damped random walk processes ( findeisen , cody & hillenbrand 2015 ) , which is the reason for adopting  stochastic \" as the descriptive name for this class .            because cody et al .",
    "( 2014 ) considered only the 2011 _ corot _ data ( and not the 2008 campaign ) and because our membership list has evolved slightly since that paper was written , we have conducted a thorough review of all of our data in order to construct the list of stochastic stars to analyse in this paper .",
    "we also have chosen to add two additional criteria in order to make the sample more characterizable and more  pure \" .",
    "first , we require that the full amplitude of the _ corot _ light curve be greater than 0.1 mag ; this criterion makes it more likely that we will be able to detect correlations between the _ corot _ light curve shape and other data .",
    "second , we have attempted to exclude stars whose light curve morphology appears to be better described as a mix of similar amplitude accretion bursts and extinction dips .",
    "light curves with features arising from a mixture of mechanisms is both possible and expected ; however , we have associated specific physical mechanisms already with accretion burst signatures and extinction dips . separating truly random",
    "walk light curve morphologies from this kind of mixed mechanism morphology is admittedly subjective , and we probably have not been completely successful .",
    "however , because our goal is not to identify a complete set of objects but is instead to identify the physical mechanism driving this light curve morphology , we believe this process is acceptable .",
    "table  [ tab : basicinformation ] presents the list of ngc  2264 ysos whose light curve satisfy our criteria .",
    "the table provides our internal name for the star , as well as the 2mass and _ corot _ designations .",
    "in addition , we provide spectral type , h@xmath0 equivalent width , light curve amplitude in the optical and infrared , an optical - ir stetson index ( stetson 1996 ) , a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) slope , and a timescale ( see  5.4 ) .",

    "there are of order 175 ctts with good _ corot _ light curves ; with seventeen stars in the stochastic light curve class , the frequency of occurrence for light curves of this type and our selection criteria is of order 10% ( versus 13% in cody et al .",
    "2014 using their slightly different selection criteria and their slightly different membership list ) .    though we have not required the stars in table  [ tab : basicinformation ] to have q , m metrics that satisfy the cody et al .",
    "( 2014 ) criteria , most of them do so , as is illustrated in figure  [ fig : stochastic_stars.qm ] .",
    "our sample includes two stars whose light curve metrics fall slightly outside the nominal stochastic - class qm box boundary .",
    "one of them ( mon-457 ) has _ corot _ light curves in both 2008 and 2011 ; the 2008 light curve falls within the qm box , whereas the 2011 light curve falls slightly below the qm lower boundary .",
    "the other star whose light curve is slightly below the lower qm boundary is mon-242 ; we include it in table  [ tab : basicinformation ] simply because its light curve morphology seems best matched to this class .",

    "( 2014 ) ; two additional accretion burst dominated stars ( mon-766 and mon-1048 ) , one star which we believe is best interpreted as having a light curve dominated by a combination of accretion bursts and flux dips due to variable extinction ( mon-1294 ) , and one star ( mon-774 ) whose 2011 light curve we attribute to aperiodic extinction dips . other interpretations could be made for the 2011 mon-774 light curve ; our choice was strongly influenced by the fact that its 2008 light curve was clearly that of an aa  tau analog ( periodic , deep , broad flux dips due to variable extinction ) and that stars with aa  tau - type light curves often switch to aperiodic flux dip dominated light curves at other epochs ( mcginnis et al .  2015 ) .",
    "while the q and m statistics for the stars in figure  [ fig : stochastic_stars.set1 ] and figure  [ fig : stochastic_stars.set2 ] assign them to the same morphological light curve class , at first glance their light curves nevertheless appear somewhat heterogeneous . in significant part",
    ", that is because the characteristic timescales for their variations differ ( see  5 ) .",
    "specifically , some of the stars have quite short characteristic timescales ( e.g. , mon-346 , 577 , 985 and 6491 ) , whereas others have relatively long timescales ( e.g. , mon-425 , 457 , 491 ) . in order to better illustrate the similarity of their light curves , figure  [ fig : stochastic_stars.expanded ]",
    "shows the light curves of two of the stars with short timescales in an expanded view . with the x - axis",
    "expanded roughly five times in scale , the light curves for these two stars ( mon-346 and mon-985 ) look much more similar to the light curves for the long timescale members of the class .",
    "= .99    before proceeding to our discussion of the _ corot _ light curves for the stochastic stars and the probable physical mechanism causing their optical variability , it is useful to consider the physical properties of these stars as derived from their mean observed colors and spectral types . if these stars differ in some significant aspect from the other ctts in ngc  2264 , that could help us interpret their photometric variability . towards this end , we provide four diagnostic plots : a @xmath6 vs.  @xmath7 color - magnitude diagram ; a @xmath8 vs.  @xmath9 color - color plot ; a @xmath10 vs.  @xmath11 near - ir color - color plot , and the irac [ 3.6 ] @xmath12 [ 4.5 ] vs.  [ 5.8 ] @xmath12 [ 8.0 ] color - color plot .",

    "this agrees with extinction estimates derived from combining the observed @xmath13 colors ( sung et al .",
    "2008 ) , published spectral types ( table  [ tab : basicinformation ] and cody et al .",
    "2014 ) , and standard colors for young stars from pecaut & mamajek ( 2013 ) , where the median @xmath14 colors are 0.42 , 0.05 and 0.15 for the stochastic , accretion burst and variable - extinction classes , respectively .",
    "the derived @xmath14 for the accretion burst stars is probably an underestimate because their @xmath13 colors are significantly influenced by hot spots , while the @xmath14 colors of the variable extinction stars may be underestimated if scattered light from the disk contributes significantly to their optical flux .",
    "the three stochastic stars with the largest @xmath11 colors ( mon-457 , 491 , and 985 ) also have the largest disk to photosphere contrast ratios at 4.5 @xmath1 m  ( see table  [ tab : basicinformation ] , column 7 ) , demonstrating that their light is disk - dominated in the ir .",
    "0.01truein 2 ) from the optical color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) ( figure  [ fig : optcmd_nearirccd]b ) , we conclude that the stochastic stars are not , on average , displaced  vertically \" relative to the other ctts groups nor relative to the weak - lined t  tauri ( wtts ) sample .",
    "if the cmd can be used to infer relative ages , this indicates no significant age difference between these stars despite their quite different light curve morphologies . as shown in table  [ tab : basicinformation ] , the stochastic class includes ysos with spectral types spanning the entire g to mid - m range .",
    "the stochastic and variable extinction classes dominate the upper - left portion of the cmd , indicating they probably include a larger fraction of high mass ctts compared to the accretion burst class .",

    "later m spectral types retain @xmath17 1.4 but become bluer in @xmath16 , presumably due to enhanced chromospheric emission .",
    "reddening shifts stars towards the upper right in the diagram ; accretion primarily shifts stars down but also slightly to the left .",
    "the diagram shows that , on average , the stochastic stars have smaller uv excesses than the stars with accretion - burst dominated light curves , but comparable uv excesses as for the variable extinction sample . a student - t test yields a less than 10@xmath19 probability that the accretion burst stars are drawn from the same parent population as the other two classes , but finds no significant difference between the stochastic and variable extinction classes .",

    "in the herbst et al .  ( 1994 ) taxonomy , stars in their type ii light curve category would generally map into cody s stochastic class .",
    "herbst et al.advocated that the most probable physical mechanism to explain their type ii light curves was variable hot spots possibly accompanied by rotational modulation bringing those hot spots into or out of the visible hemisphere .",
    "we agree with that assessment . as noted by herbst et al .",
    ", if this is the case , the light curve modulation should be accompanied by changes in spectral veiling , resulting in photospheric absorption lines having smaller equivalent widths when the hot spot contribution to the optical light is greater . for the stochastic stars for which we have synoptic vlt spectroscopy , we will show that they do exhibit variable veiling consistent with the amplitude of the optical variability shown in the corot light curves .",
    "the linkage of changes in the spectral veiling to the optical light curve morphology is made difficult because most of our spectroscopy was obtained after the corot photometric campaigns . also , in some cases , the only photospheric absorption line we can measure accurately is the lithium 6708 doublet , whose equivalent width could be affected by other processes ( basri , martn & bertout 1991 ; barrado et al .  2001 ; baraffe & chabrier 2010 ) .",
    "our analysis therefore proceeds as follows : ( a ) for the brighter stars with synoptic vlt spectra , we show that their spectra do show significant veiling variability as measured by several atomic absorption features , and the variability shown by the lithium doublet is well - correlated with the veiling changes ; ( b ) for all of the stochastic stars where we can measure variations in the lithium absorption strength , that variability correlates well with changes in the strength of the 6678   emission line  an accretion diagnostic ; ( c ) the inferred continuum level changes needed to explain the veiling variability is consistent with the measured corot light curve amplitudes ; ( d ) the mean veiling of the stochastic stars is small , consistent with their uv excesses ; and ( e ) the uv variability seen in the stochastic stars , as measured by the slope shown in a delta(@xmath20 ) vs. delta(@xmath21 ) cmd is also best explained by variable hot spots ( see also venuti et al .",
    "2015b ) .      for four of the stars with stochastic light curves",
    ", we have synoptic vlt spectra of good enough quality to accurately measure equivalent widths for 6708 and at least one other photospheric absorption line .",
    "these observations show that there are large variations in the absorption line equivalent widths ( veiling variability ) over the time period of the vlt campaigns and that the lithium strength variations track well the variations in the other absorption features .",
    "figure  [ fig : stochastic_stars.veiling ] shows the equivalent width data for these four stars , along with similar data for two of the accretion burst stars .",
    "the veiling variability is a natural consequence of a varying hot spot contribution to the star s continuum flux and is not expected for any of the other mechanisms that are known to drive significant photometric variability in low mass ysos ( e.g. , cold spots or variable extinction ) .",
    "for the four stars above , plus one additional stochastic star , we have synoptic vlt spectra from which we can accurately measure the 6708 equivalent width and for which the 6678 line is sometimes in emission .",
    "the 6678 line is present in high - resolution spectra for many ctts , sometimes as a broad feature possibly associated with a hot wind ( beristain , edwards and kwan 2001 ) , and sometimes as a narrow ( fwhm @xmath2 36 ) , approximately gaussian feature , usually ascribed to hot gas created in the shock where the accretion flow impacts the stellar photosphere ( johns - krull et al .",
    "our stochastic light curve stars with vlt spectra only show the narrow emission feature .",
    "therefore , we would expect stronger emission to correlate with stronger accretion flux , and the emission and 6708 absorption strengths should correlate for stars where accretion variability is strong .",
    "figure  [ fig : stochastic_stars.lihei ] shows that this correlation is indeed present for all five stars with stochastic light curves where we have the data to make this test ( the figure also includes data for mon-945 , a star with an accretion - burst dominated light curve , to illustrate how this diagram should appear if accretion drives the variability ) .            figures  [ fig : stochastic_stars.veiling ] and [ fig : stochastic_stars.lihei ] prove that at least these specific members of the stochastic light curve class have optical brightnesses that vary with time due to variable accretion .",
    "however , this does not necessarily require that their light curve shapes and amplitudes are primarily due to variable accretion luminosity  other mechanisms ( such as variable extinction ) could cause optical brightness variations that in principle could be larger than the accretion - driven variations .",
    "if our spectroscopy and photometry were simultaneous , we could directly compare the continuum flux variations inferred from the spectroscopy with the light curve amplitudes - however , our _ corot _ data are from 2008 and 2011 , whereas the majority of our spectroscopy is from 2013 . even for those stars where we have 2011 multi - epoch spectroscopy",
    ", the overlap in time with the _ corot _ campaign is small , and we therefore can not make a useful direct comparison . however , we can make a statistical test  is the inferred range in accretion flux at 6700   derived from the veiling data ( mostly from 2013 ) consistent with the measured amplitude in the corot light curves ( mostly from 2011 ) ?",
    "figure  [ fig : stochastic_stars.fluxvar ] shows this comparison for the stochastic stars for which we have multi - epoch vlt data .",
    "there is considerable scatter in the plot , but the data are consistent with the variable continuum inferred from the spectroscopy matching the variable continuum measured in the light curves - supporting the conclusion that variable accretion is the dominant cause of the optical variability .    finally , having argued that the lithium equivalent widths for ctts can be used as a relative veiling ( and hence accretion ) indicator , we can also use the mean lithium equivalent widths for the stochastic light curve stars to estimate their mean veiling levels . in table  [ tab : other_data ] , we provide mean lithium equivalent widths for the stochastic light curve stars , either measured from our multi - epoch vlt / flames data , or in six cases , as measured from single - epoch vlt / flames spectra obtained by the eso - gaia project ( randich et al .",
    "we also provide an estimated maximum photospheric lithium equivalent width for that spectral type , based on a fit to the upper - envelope of the lithium equivalent widths for all ysos in ngc  2264 for which we have flames spectra .",
    "this allows us to derive an upper limit to the veiling at 6700   for each of these stochastic stars .",
    "it can be seen that the mean lithium equivalent widths for the stochastic stars differ only slightly from their expected photospheric values , suggesting veilings of generally 10% or less . the median lithium veiling from table  [ tab : other_data ] for the stochastic stars is 0.17 ; for reference , the median veiling for the accretion burst and variable extinction classes are 0.36 and 0.17 .",
    "the average veiling we derive for the stochastic stars therefore agrees with the conclusion drawn from their uv excesses ( figure  [ fig : uvexcess_irac - ccd]a ) that stars of this light curve class have low to moderate accretion rates ( significantly lower than stars with accretion burst dominated light curves ) , but similar to the average accretion rate for stars with variable extinction dominated light curves .",

    "et al .  ( 2014 ) , we showed that ngc  2264 ctts with accretion - burst light curves had h@xmath0 profiles that were distinctly different , on average , from those for the variable extinction light curve class . specifically , the h@xmath0 profiles of the accretion burst stars are much more often centrally peaked and lacking in distinct absorption features compared to the variable extinction stars , while the variable extinction stars much more frequently show h@xmath0 absorption dips on the red side of the emission profile .",
    "these characteristics are explicable within the theoretical models ( kurosawa & romanova 2013 ) , with the centrally peaked profiles being a prediction for stars with the highest accretion rates and the redward displaced absorption dips being a consequence of our line of sight intersecting warm gas that is accreting onto the stellar photosphere .",

    "the spectra used for figure  [ fig : multi_halpha.2013 ] were obtained during a thirteen day interval in 2013 , with two spectra obtained on nights 1 , 8 , 9 , 10 and 13 , and single spectra on nights 4 and 7 .",
    "the h@xmath0 profiles for mon-457 were relatively stable over this period , with the primary variation being in the height of the blue peak , which first increased by about 20% and then decreased by about 50% .",

    "such blue - shifted absorption dips are believed to arise from gas in a disk wind .",
    "if this is indeed the case , the fact that ( when we have appropriate spectra ) the blue absorption dips are fairly stable on timescales of two weeks or more indicates that the disk wind structure is also relatively stable on those timescales ( longer than , for example , the expected photospheric rotation periods of these stars ) .",

    "; k7 = 57 ; m2 = 62 ) and then taking averages , the mean spectral types for the four groups are k3 ( stochastic ) , k5 ( aa  tau ) , k7 ( burst ) and m0 ( short - duration flux dip ) .      knowledge of , or at least constraints on , the inclination of a young star s rotation axis to our line of sight can be very helpful in attempting to determine a physical mechanism to explain the observed variability .",
    "for the variable extinction light curve class , if one assumes that the extinction events occur when structures in the inner disk pass through our line of sight , then the presence of the flux dips plus a theoretically modelled disk scale height constrain the inclination of the disk to be @xmath34  60@xmath35.@xmath36   greater than which the star is always obscured , there is a range of inclinations between @xmath37@xmath36  and @xmath37@xmath38  where variable extinction events may occur , and for inclinations less than @xmath37@xmath38  no disk - related extinction events occur . from the census of ctts light curves in ngc  2264 ( alencar 2010 , stauffer et al .",

    "we can draw some inferences on the disk inclinations for the stochastic light curve class members simply from their light curve morphology ; we can infer a little more from their spectra  as we describe below .",
    "members of the stochastic light curve class are in all cases ctts .",
    "they have circumstellar disks that extend inward close enough to the star s photosphere to produce class ii seds . by definition of our light curve classes ,",
    "a star in the stochastic class does not have deep flux dips due to variable extinction events , and therefore the inclination of our line of sight to their disks is almost certainly @xmath29 60@xmath35 . as noted in stauffer et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , two of the stochastic light curve stars do have probable short - duration flux dips in their light curves ( one dip each in 2008 and 2011 for mon-119 , and two dips in 2011 for mon-577 - see figure  [ fig : stochastic_stars.set1 ] ) .",
    "these short duration flux dips may arise from dust in accretion columns  and hence from dust above the expected disk upper surface layer .",
    "even if the occulting dust is nominally part of the disk material , the short duration and shallowness of these flux dips suggest that the dust would be located in the upper surface layer of the disk . hence , even for these stars , we expect @xmath40 60@xmath35 .",
    "= .99    if there were well - measured periods , @xmath41 s , and radii available for the stochastic stars , it would be possible to directly estimate @xmath42 .",
    "however , periods are not known ( more or less  by definition \" ) for the stochastic stars",
    ". nevertheless , one might at least determine if the stochastic stars have an unusual @xmath41  distribution compared to other ctts in ngc  2264 , and from that either be able to draw inferences about their inclinations or their intrinsic rotational velocities s is provided in the appendix . ] .",
    "even that exercise is limited due to the spectral types of the stochastic stars ( figure  [ fig : sptype.histo ] ) , because the stochastic stars include an excess ( relative to the other light curve classes ) of relatively early type stars ( @xmath43 k3 ) .",
    "these early type stars will arrive on the zams as a or f stars , and hence even on the pms will have systematically higher rotational velocities than lower mass ctts .",
    "the actual @xmath41 s , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : stochastic_stars.li_vsini_hist ] confirm this bias , with many of the most rapidly rotating stars in all three plotted ctts groups having spectral type k3 or earlier .",
    "excluding the early spectral types , the distribution of @xmath41 s for the three ctts groups looks quite similar .",
    "the average @xmath41 s confirm this : the mean @xmath41 s for the three groups are 19.0  ( n=10 ) , 20.8  ( n=17 ) , and 18.7  ( n=15 ) for the stochastic , accretion burst , and variable extinction classes , respectively .",
    "the accretion burst mean is significantly influenced by one very discrepant star - mon-7 , with @xmath41  = 85 ; excluding mon-7 , the accretion burst class average @xmath41  becomes 16.9 .",
    "the essential equality of the mean @xmath41 s for the stochastic and variable extinction stars is perhaps unexpected . given our conclusions concerning the line of sight inclination to the rotation axes of the two classes ( @xmath44 60@xmath35  for the variable extinction class and @xmath40 60@xmath35 for the stochastic class ) , and assuming a random distribution of inclinations within those ranges , one would predict @xmath45 1.5 ; hence for @xmath5@xmath41@xmath4 = 18  for the variable extinction class , one would have expected @xmath5@xmath41@xmath4 = 12  for the stochastic class . at face value , therefore , the equality of their average @xmath41 s suggests that the stochastic stars might be comparatively rapid rotators .",
    "however , because the mean value for the stochastic class was derived from only ten stars , we believe it prudent to simply conclude that it is unlikely that the stochastic stars are unusually slowly rotating .",
    "one can obtain useful constraints on the timescale associated with accretion variability in the stochastic stars from our multi - epoch vlt / flames spectra .",
    "if the accretion rate changed only slowly with time ( e.g. , with a several day time constant ) , then spectra taken on the same night , or on successive nights , would have lithium equivalent widths or 6678   fluxes that differ from each other by significantly less than spectra separated by several days .",
    "we have seven stars with multi - epoch vlt data ( from either 2011 or 2013 ) where we can make this test using lithium , and four stars where this test is possible for the helium emission line ( the other stars either never or rarely show helium emission ) .",
    "for each star , we identified time lags with at least three pairs of epochs with that time lag ( often there were more than three ) . for each time lag",
    ", we calculated the mean absolute deviation between the measured equivalent widths for each pair of epochs .",
    "figure  [ fig : flames_mad ] shows the time lag plots for lithium 6708  and helium 6678 . as an ensemble ,",
    "the plotted data indicate that most of the variability occurs on timescales of order a day or less .",
    "photometric light curves , of course , provide a much more direct means with which to derive variability timescales . for stars with periodic light curves , one can easily determine that period and often associate that period with a physical mechanism ( e.g. the rotation period of the star ) . for stars with aperiodic light curves ,",
    "it is much more difficult to derive a timescale which correlates well with the shape one  sees \" in the light curve and which can be convincingly linked to a physical mechanism .",
    "after some experimentation , we decided to derive timescale estimates based on an algorithm that measures how long it takes for the light curve to change by a given fraction of its full amplitude .",
    "specifically , for every point in the light curve , the algorithm looks both forward and backward in time , and determines the time lag needed for the absolute difference in magnitude to change by a given amount .",
    "we then average the derived time lag for every light curve point to determine the mean time lag for that delta magnitude .",
    "we calculate those timescales for steps in delta magnitude ranging from 0.005 mag up to one half the full magnitude range in the light curve .",
    "when portions of the light curve seem to have linear trends in magnitude ( only the first half of the mon-425 light curve , and the last third of the mon-795 light curve  see figure  [ fig : stochastic_stars.set1 ] and figure  [ fig : stochastic_stars.set2 ] ) , we first detrend the light curve to remove that linear trend .",
    "we associate a characteristic time for the star as the derived mean time lag for a delta magnitude corresponding to half the full amplitude of the light curve .",
    "these characteristic timescales are provided in table  [ tab : basicinformation ] .",
    "the timescales range from half a day to of order five days , with most of the stars having timescales near one day  in accord with the analysis of the vlt / flames multi - epoch data .    in principle",
    ", the way in which the mean time lag depends on delta magnitude should encode information on the light curve shape .",
    "figure  [ fig : stochastic_stars.deltatdeltamag ] plots this relation both for our stochastic stars and for a comparison set of stars with periodic light curves .",
    "the plot shows nearly linear correlations for the periodic light curve stars , with all of the stochastic stars falling below that relationship . the stochastic stars with short characteristic timescales ( @xmath46 1.2 days ) in general fall closer to the periodic relation than the stochastic stars with longer characteristic timescales .",
    "= .99    at a macroscopic level , it is reasonable to think of the light curves for the stochastic variables as reflective simply of a global accretion process whose @xmath47 varies in a seemingly random way .",
    "such light curves can be well - matched by simulations with a damped random walk process ( e.g. , findeisen et al .  2015 ) .",
    "however , on a microscopic level , it is possible that all of the variability arises from individual accretion events creating transient hot spots of variable size , temperature and lifetime .",
    "if so , the properties of the observed light curves could be used to place constraints on the properties of the individual accretion events .",
    "we have created a simple monte carlo process model to explore this idea .",
    "our model produces light curves of total duration 34 days , from which we extract the central 30-day portions ( to minimize edge effects ) .",
    "we distribute n gaussian flux bursts during the observing window , with each burst having a height , width and central epoch chosen randomly within specified bounds from a uniform distribution .",
    "we also add a continuum level to simulate the contribution to the light from the stellar photosphere .",
    "we vary the number of bursts and the parameter bounds ( a ) to match the observed light curve amplitudes ; ( b ) to match the mean veiling ( the fraction of the light from accretion compared to that from the photosphere ) ; ( c ) to yield values of q and m appropriate for stars with stochastic light curves ; and ( d ) to yield timescales as judged from our @xmath28 m vs. @xmath28 t algorithm that approximately match specific stochastic class stars .    figure  [ fig : stochastic_models]a shows a simulated light curve (  case a \" ) whose morphology , amplitude , mean veiling and timescale ( @xmath48 = 1.4 days ) was designed as a reasonable match to the _ corot _ light curve of either mon-346 or mon-577 ( see figure  [ fig : stochastic_stars.set1 ] ) . the parameters for this model were n ( number of bursts in 30 days ) = 300 , fwhm = 0.2 to 0.7 days ; height = 5.0 to 20.0 ( in  counts \" ) , and photospheric continuum level = 500 ( in  counts \" ) .",

    "figure  [ fig : stochastic_models]c shows that as the frequency of bursts decreases , individual bursts become more visible and the light curve evolves to better resemble our accretion burst light curve class ( stauffer et al .",
    "the parameters for this light curve were n = 30 , fwhm = 0.5 to 1.5 days , height = 5.0 to 18.0 , and photospheric continuum = 400 .",

    "also plotted are the @xmath28 t , @xmath28 m values for two idealized periodic light curves - a sine wave and a sawtooth function .",
    "the models designed to look like our stochastic stars have @xmath28 t , @xmath28 m loci in the diagram that mimics the loci for the stochastic stars ( figure  [ fig : stochastic_stars.deltatdeltamag ] ) .",
    "we view this exercise as primarily a proof of concept .",
    "the stochastic light curves can indeed be simulated with many small , discrete flux bursts .",
    "there must be many bursts , on average , per day in order to yield light curve shapes that appear symmetric about their median value .",
    "however , the durations of the events must be kept short in order that the summed flux from the accretion events does not become too large and the light curves do not become too smooth ( low amplitude ) .",
    "the parameters we have chosen for case a and b are presumably not unique , but they at least provide possible choices that could yield light curves similar to those we observe in ngc  2264 .",
    "the optical photons from ctts come primarily from the photosphere and the hot spots produced by accretion shocks .",
    "the irac ( 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath1 m ) photons also originate from these regions , as well as from warm dust in the inner circumstellar disk . for stars with only small ir excesses from warm dust , and where there is little or no variable extinction , the optical and ir light curves should be well - correlated ( but possibly with significantly different amplitudes ) , regardless of the physical mechanism driving the variability . for stars where the disk photons dominate at irac wavelengths , the optical and ir light curves could be quite uncorrelated , depending on the physical mechanisms involved .",
    "the most likely physical processes driving variability at irac wavelengths are : ( a ) heating of the dust in the inner disk by reprocessing of the photons emitted from the star s surface ; ( b ) changes in the inner disk dust surface area exposed to the stellar photon bath ( e.g. , from instabilities lifting more dust into the disk photosphere ) ; and ( c ) viscous , self - heating of the inner disk .",
    "the optical - ir correlation can also be affected by details of the geometry  a transient hot spot on the side of the star facing us produces a flux burst most evident in the optical light curve , but if that hot spot is not located in a position where it is seen by the warm dust that dominates the irac light , then it may have only a minor impact on the irac light curve .",
    "conversely , a transient flux burst on the back side of the star would have no impact on the optical light curve that we see , but could have a significant impact on the ir light curve if the ir flux is dominated by photons from warm dust in the inner disk wall that faces the back side of the star , as is in fact likely . as discussed extensively in whitney et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , the correlation between the optical and ir light curves of the stochastic stars therefore can provide important clues to the physics underlying their variability ; we discuss that correlation for our stochastic stars now .",
    "table  [ tab : basicinformation ] provides two quantities related to the optical / ir variability issue  the estimated disk to photosphere flux ratio at 4.5 @xmath1 m  ( column 6 ) , derived from our single - epoch photometry obtained prior to 2010 , and an optical - to - ir stetson index ( column 8) , derived from our 2011 csi  2264 campaign data .",
    "the disk to photosphere ratio ranges from 0.4 for mon-242 , a star with very little ir excess , to @xmath410 for mon-985 , a star with a very large ir excess . the stetson index ( see cody et al .",
    "2014 for a more thorough discussion ) ranges from 0.41 ( largely uncorrelated ) to @xmath42 ( well - correlated ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : super.corot_irac ] shows an overlay of the _ corot _ and irac light curves for four of the stochastic stars where the stetson index indicates a good degree of correlation between the optical and ir light curves .",
    "the stars in figure  [ fig : super.corot_irac ] are arranged in order ( top - left to bottom - right ) of increasing disk dominance at 4.5 @xmath1 m , with disk - to - star flux ratios of 0.4 , 2.9 , 5.4 , and @xmath410 for mon-242 , 119 , 636 , and 985 , respectively .",
    "visual examination of the four panels indicates that they are also arranged approximately in order of the degree to which the amplitude and shape of the short - timescale ir fluctuations match those in the optical .",
    "the optical and ir light curves for mon-242 track each other very well on short timescales in both shape and amplitude .",
    "mon-119 generally shows well - defined ir peaks at location of the optical peaks , with amplitudes often of order half that as shown in the optical .",
    "mon-636 and mon-985 , both having disk - dominated irac photometry , show much lower amplitude variability in the ir compared to the optical , but often appear to have barely discernible features at the location of structures in the optical light curve",
    ". a better view of the optical - ir correlation for these two stars is provided in figure  [ fig : super.corot_irac_blow ] , where the irac light curves are shown magnified by a factor of 3 in the y - axis .",
    "this plot shows that , in fact , there is still a good correlation in the optical and ir short - timescale morphology , but the amplitudes of the irac peaks are on average about one third the amplitude of the optical peaks .",
    "close examination of the four panels of figure  [ fig : super.corot_irac ] , shows some optical features which appear to be completely lacking in ir counterparts .",
    "good examples are flux excesses in the optical light curve for mon-119 at days @xmath212 and@xmath220 , with no evidence at all for a feature at those times in the irac light curve",
    ". there are no obvious inverse situations , where an isolated irac flux peak is lacking a simultaneous _ corot _ peak .",
    "assume for the moment that the accretion hot spots have effective temperatures of order 8000 k and that our ctts are all around spectral type k4 .",
    "if the hot spot emitted as a blackbody , it would have @xmath49 \\sim$ ] 0 , and the  quiescent \" photosphere would have @xmath49 \\sim$ ] 2 . in the absence of any warm dust ,",
    "an accretion burst causing a 0.2 mag brightening in the optical light curve ( comparable to the light curve amplitude for a typical stochastic star ) would cause only a @xmath20.03 mag brightening at 4 @xmath1 m . for stars with large ir excess , where the disk dominates the 4 @xmath1 m  flux by a large factor , the flux variation at 4 @xmath1 m directly from the photosphere would be even lower . because the emitted flux from accretion hot spots has a spectral shape closer to f@xmath50  @xmath2 constant rather than a blackbody spectrum ( hartigan 1989 ; basri & batalha 1990 ) , this estimate is somewhat inaccurate , but we believe the basic conclusion is still valid . therefore , it is unlikely that the flux variation at irac wavelengths seen in any of the stars in figure  [ fig : super.corot_irac ] is directly a result of the variable photospheric contribution .",
    "assume now also that radiative heating dominates the energy budget for the warm dust responsible for the flux at irac wavelengths , and also assume that the system geometry is such that the transient hot spot is well positioned to be seen by us and by the warm dust in the inner disk .",
    "in that case , a change in the luminosity of the star of @xmath28m(bol)@xmath51 due to appearance of a transient hot spot should approximately result in a similar increase in the luminosity of the warm dust .",
    "a 8000 k hot spot should have an sed peaked near 4000  , close enough to the center of the broad _ corot _ bandpass such that a 20% change in the _ corot _ light curve flux should correspond approximately to a 20% change in luminosity of the hot spot . for 1000 k dust ,",
    "@xmath52 4 @xmath1 m , and a 20% change in the irac light curve should correspond approximately to a 20% change in the luminosity of the warm dust .",
    "this suggests that there could be a good correlation between optical and ir light curves for stars with disk - dominated fluxes at irac wavelengths , which we in fact do see ( figure  [ fig : super.corot_irac_blow ] ) . to be explained",
    "still are the variable , and sometimes small ir - to - optical amplitude ratios , and the optical peaks with no apparent ir counterpart .",
    "it is possible to adjust the geometry to reduce the response of the disk to the hot spot luminosity variations by placing the hot spots at higher stellar latitude .",
    "this reduces the projected area of the hot spot as seen by the inner disk dust roughly as the cosine of the spot latitude , so that a spot at 70@xmath35 latitude would have about half the disk heating impact of a spot of the same physical size if at 45@xmath35 latitude . for an observer located near the rotation axis of the star",
    ", spots at such high latitudes would always be visible and the portion of the inner disk - rim they ",
    "light up \" should have similar view angles to the observer  which would result in a good correlation between the optical and ir peaks and a rarity of cases where there is an optical peak without an ir counterpart . as either the spot latitude decreases or the inclination of the observer s line of sight to the system rotation axis increases , the chance for a transient hot spot occurring where it is not visible to the observer increases .",
    "therefore , the observed correlation between the optical and ir light curves favors both relatively high spot latitudes and relatively low inclinations of the system rotation axis to our line of sight .",
    "this geometry also naturally reduces any periodic signature in our light curve due to the star s rotation .",
    "based on the preceding sections , we can summarize the properties that characterize stars whose optical light curves fall into our stochastic class as :    * by selection , their optical light curves appear symmetric about their median level , with no preference for discrete downward flux dips ( variable extinction ) nor upward flux bursts ( short - duration flux bursts ) .",
    "the lack of flux dips due to extinction excludes stars where the inclination of our line of sight to the circumstellar disk is large , implying @xmath40 60@xmath35 .",
    "* by selection , their optical light curves show very little periodic signature . *",
    "the fraction of the ctts in ngc  2264 having optical light curves of this type is about 10% .",
    "* as judged by their uv excesses , h@xmath0 equivalent widths , and veiling of optical absorption lines , the stars with stochastic light curves have relatively low to moderate accretion rates .",
    "their mean veiling level is generally of order 10% to 20% .",
    "* their _ corot _ light curves show amplitudes generally in the range of 10% to 30% .",
    "* in all cases , their broad - band ir photometry indicates sed slopes consistent with class ii * the members of the stochastic light curve class have spectral types ranging from early g to early m , with a somewhat earlier mean spectral type than our other ctts light curve classes .",
    "* the stochastic stars have small reddening , as judged from the @xmath53 vs.  @xmath54 color - color diagram and from comparison of their observed optical colors to colors predicted based on their spectral types . * their h@xmath0 profiles are most often characterized by blue - shifted absorption dips that are usually present with similar shape and amplitude at all epochs , best explained as due to gas in a disk wind seen from moderate to low inclination angles . *",
    "they have veiling variability and color changes derived from multi - epoch photometry indicative of a variable blue continuum source , consistent with expectation for photospheric hot spots whose size or temperature change with time .",
    "* variability timescales for the stochastic stars derived either from the light curves or from multi - epoch spectroscopy are generally of order 1 - 2 days .",
    "* there is usually a good correlation between the optical and ir light curve morphologies on short timescales , but often much lower amplitudes for the ir fluctuations ; short timescale events at one wavelength but not the other are quite rare .",
    "these characteristics are best explained by placing the transient hot spots at high stellar latitudes and the observer at low inclination angles to the star system rotation axis .",
    "our data show that the light curve variability of the stochastic class arises from their having highly variable photospheric mass accretion . of course ,",
    "all ctts presumably have variable mass accretion rates . for some ctts , most notably the variable extinction light curve class ,",
    "other processes produce fluctuations in the optical flux of much larger amplitude which mask the comparatively small changes in brightness due to the variable accretion rate .",
    "where such camouflage is not present , there appears to be ( at least ) three light curve morphologies where accretion processes drive the variability .",
    "stars with one or two dominant , stable accretion flows ( funnel flow accretion ) where the star s rotation is the dominant timescale can produce quasi - periodic , symmetric (  hot spot \" ) light curves ( cody et al .  2014 ) , like that shown in figure  [ fig : sixctts]e . stars with the highest accretion rates have light curves dominated by relatively strong , short - duration accretion bursts that are usually random in time but sometimes occur as periodic burst groups ( stauffer et al .  2014 ;",
    "blinova et al .",
    "2015 ) . what is the physical driver for the variability shown by the stochastic light curve class ?",
    "we believe a clue to the answer to this question can be found by considering the members of the variable extinction class , and in particular one of the prototypes ",

    "( 2010 ) concluded that ( a ) its magnetic dipole axis is tilted by @xmath2 20@xmath35  relative to its rotation axis ; ( b ) the primary accretion hot spots are located near latitude = 70@xmath35 ; ( c ) its mean mass accretion rate to the stellar surface is quite small , with veiling levels ranging from near zero up to @xmath20.2 ; ( d ) that the accretion rate varies significantly on timescales less than the stellar rotation period .",
    "concerning the variability in the inferred accretion rate , they also concluded that  ... the accretion variability observed for aa  tau mostly relates to the variable efficiency at which the disc material succeeds at entering the closed magnetosphere in the propeller regime , rather than to an intrinsic variability of the accretion rate within the inner disc . \"",
    "this characterization of accretion in aa  tau very nearly matches our description of accretion in the stochastic light curve class , and we believe this points to the most likely physical model for their variability",
    ". our line of sight to the variable extinction class members must be @xmath55 .",
    "there must be at least as many ctts with the same accretion properties but seen at @xmath56 .",
    "our data support identifying at least many of these low - inclination counterparts to the variable extinction class stars with members of the stochastic light curve class . adopting the donati et al .",
    "( 2010 ) conclusion for aa  tau , we suggest that instability processes in the disk photosphere regulate the flow of material onto the magnetic field lines in the funnel flow , thereby also leading to the stochastically variable flux from hot spots on the stellar surface .",
    "some fraction of the variable extinction stars may have more stable accretion and hence have hot spots that are relatively stable in size and location ; when seen at moderate inclination , these stars should have light curves that are more or less periodic .",
    "cody et al ( 2014 ) labelled such stars as quasi - periodic , symmetric .",
    "future synoptic studies of star - forming regions should be conducted to determine whether stars with quasi - periodic , hot - spot light curves can transition to the stochastic light - curve morphology ( and , if so , how the statistics for that transition compares to the statistics for the transition between aa  tau type light curves and the aperiodic flux dip light curve class ) .",

    "we have used two methods to assign stars to the stochastic light curve class , with each method having its own uncertainties .",
    "one method uses quantitative formulae to derive metrics for the light curves ( cody et al .",
    "2014 ) ; however , the formulae are empirical and the boundaries are to some extent arbitrary .",
    "the other method is entirely qualitative and is based on  by eye \" classification of the light curves by sorting them into groups which seem to have similar properties .",
    "the light curves shown here in figure  [ fig : othercorot ] match the algorithmic definition to be in the stochastic light curve class , but did not pass our  by eye \" classification scheme .",
    "they therefore are not included in our final list of stars with stochastic light curves ( table  [ tab : basicinformation ] ) .",
    "see discussion in  3 .          in  4.1 , we showed that when we had appropriate synoptic high - resolution spectroscopy , the stars with stochastic light curves have veiling levels which vary with time and are quantitatively consistent with the observed photometric variability",
    ". we also showed that the  6708  doublet - the strongest absorption feature in our spectra - can be used as a veiling indicator ( because its equivalent width variations correlate well with the equivalent width variations of other absorption features in our spectra ) and that the variations in the lithium equivalent widths also correlate well with variations in the strength of the 6678 emission line .            in this section ,",
    "we wish to show that these same spectral features can also be used as diagnostics of the physical processes underlying the variability for other light curve classes . for this purpose ,",
    "we have selected six stars with disparate light curve morphologies and for which ( a ) the _ corot _ light curve amplitude in 2011 is at least 0.10 mag ( in order to be comparable to the typical amplitudes for the stochastic stars and in order to ensure a strong signal in our spectral indices if variable accretion drives the light curve morphology ) and ( b ) we have multi - epoch vlt / flames spectra in 2011 .",
    "these six stars include ( 1 ) a wtts with a periodic , stable light curve morphology which we attribute to cold spots ; ( b ) a ctts having a periodic light curve which we would also normally attribute to cold spots ; ( c ) two ctts whose _ corot _ light curves show quasi - periodic structures which we attribute to hot spots ; and ( d ) two ctts whose _ corot _ light curves have unusual morphologies which do not obviously align well with our standard light curve classes .",
    "figure  [ fig : morph_vs_spectra.set1 ] and figure  [ fig : morph_vs_spectra.set2 ] show the _ corot _ light curves , the correlation between lithium equivalent width and 6678  , and the correlation between lithium equivalent width and the equivalent width of other relatively strong absorption features in our echelle order .    for these plots , as well as all the other similar plots in this paper ,",
    "we have utilized sky - subtracted spectra .",
    "that is , for each object fiber , we have found the nearest sky fiber ( which could be up to a few arminutes away ) and subtracted the latter from the former .",
    "due to the spatially varying nebulosity , this is a necessarily imperfect process . for the absorption line and emission line measures of most interest here , sky subtraction",
    "primarily is needed in order to minimize any contribution from scattered moon light .",
    "the 2013 spectra were taken almost entirely during a dark run , and therefore the sky fiber continuum levels are very low and the uncertainty in sky correction has very little possible impact . for 2011 , however , spectra were taken at all lunar phases , and the sky continuum level varies significantly and so could impact equivalent widths for faint stars .",
    "this is probably the largest source of uncertainty in our plots , though we believe it should not impact any of our conclusions . for the 6678 equivalent width , an additional source of uncertainty",
    "is that there is an absorption feature almost coincident in wavelength with the line , and whose strength is not negligible with respect to the line we normally see .",
    "we have corrected our measured equivalent widths for this fei feature by measuring the strength of the latter line in wtts as a function of spectral type , and then subtracting this amount from the measured equivalent widths for the stochastic stars .",
    "the fei equivalent widths range from 0.15   at g2 , increasing to about 0.26   at m0 , and then decreasing to 0.12   at m2 .",
    "the plots for mon-1274 ( wtts ) and mon-103 ( ctts ) show these stars have little or no veiling variability despite _ corot _ light curve amplitudes of @xmath2 0.2 mag .",
    "the rightmost plot for each star shows that 6678 is not in emission .",
    "the similar properties for the two stars indicates that cold spots can dominate the light curve morphology of ctts , as has been advocated previously ( e.g. , herbst et al .",
    "the dispersion in the plotted points for the center and rhs plots for these two stars is primarily due to measurements uncertainties .",
    "the _ corot _ light curves of mon-168 and mon-370 ( both ctts ) were selected on morphological grounds as candidates for rotational modulation of hot spots whose size / temperature vary significantly over the _ corot _ campaign duration .",
    "this results in semi - sinusoidal waveforms that are more structured than in the case of cold - spots and also are less stable in time .",
    "the spectral indices plots confirm that these stars have variable veiling and in emission , and that the absorption line veiling and emission are correlated .",
    "we therefore confirm that hot spots are the driver of the _ corot _ light curve morphology , and the period derived for these stars is the photospheric rotational period .",
    "finally , mon-498 and mon-1199 ( also both ctts ) have _ corot _ light curves whose morphology are unusual and not completely consistent with any of our light curve classes . the center plot for these two stars ( lithium versus ",
    "other \" absorption line equivalent widths ) shows no significant correlated variability , and hence no firm evidence for accretion variability .",
    "the rhs plots do show a possible correlation between the lithium equivalent width and 6678  .",
    "however , the inferred extra continuum flux would only be @xmath25% - 10%  of the stellar photosphere , thus only about half of the _ corot _ amplitude for mon-498 and only a very small fraction of the _ corot _ amplitude for mon-1199 could be attributed to accretion variability .",
    "instead , we suspect that cold spots plus one or more short - duration flux dips due to variable extinction ( at day 5906 and possibly day 5930 ) best explain the light curve for mon-498 .",
    "the lack of veiling variability and the quite large amplitude of the photometric variations for mon-1199 argue that its light curve variations are primarily due to variable extinction arising from mri or other instabilities in its inner circumstellar disk temporarily lofting more dust into the disk photosphere .",
    "stars whose light curves are dominated by deep flux dips produced by variable extinction events form another common ctts light curve class .",
    "these flux dips can either be periodic ( like aa  tau ) , and likely due to our line of sight being occulted by a warp in the inner circumstellar disk , or aperiodic , and possibly due to instabilities temporarily lifting more dust into the upper layers of the inner disk .",
    "many stars appear to cycle back and forth between these two light curve morphologies on long ( year or years ) timescales ( mcginnis et al .",
    "based on their uv excesses , mean veiling and h@xmath0 equivalent widths , these stars have similar mean mass accretion rates as the stochastic light curve class members , and therefore we might expect similar veiling variability .",
    "we have investigated this by measuring the absorption line equivalent widths for eight of the variable extinction stars ; figure  [ fig : aatau.veiling ] shows plots of the correlation between 6708 equivalent width and the other absorption lines ( plotted in the same way as was done for the stochastic stars in figure  [ fig : stochastic_stars.veiling ] ) for four of these stars . in summary , we find that the aa  tau and aperiodic flux dip stars show a range of accretion variability .",
    "the data for the two aa  tau stars with the largest measured veiling variability ( mon-811 and mon-1037 ) are shown in the top of figure  [ fig : aatau.veiling ] . at the bottom of figure  [ fig : aatau.veiling ] , we show plots for two of the mcginnis et al .",
    "( 2015 ) stars that show essentially undetectable veiling variability ( @xmath55% variation in the lithium equivalent width ) .",
    "most of the variable extinction stars in fact show undetected or barely detected ( @xmath510% ) variations in their veiling levels .",
    "this emphasizes that their large light curve amplitudes ( often more than 0.5 mag , peak to peak ) must be driven by some process other than variable accretion .",
    "our vlt / flames spectra only have a wavelength coverage of about 350  . in the echelle order",
    ", we have only two lines normally in emission for ctts are present - h@xmath0 and 6678  . for eight of the stochastic stars",
    ", we have multi - epoch data with either 12 or 20 spectra , depending on the year . in figure",
    "[ fig : multi_halpha.2013 ] , we overplot the entire set of profiles for two of the stars with multi - epoch data . here ( figure  [ fig : wild_halpha ] ) , we provide single epoch h@xmath0 profiles for  representative \" profiles for each of the stars for which we have vlt / flames spectra .",
    "where we have multi - epoch data , we have tried to choose an epoch which shows features which are present in the majority of the epochs .          in table",
    "[ tab : sptypes ] we provide the spectral types used to construct the spectral type histograms for the accretion burst , variable extinction and short - duration flux dips classes shown in figure  [ fig : sptype.histo ] .",
    "the spectral types for the stochastic class are provided in table  [ tab : basicinformation ] .",
    "for all four groups , where possible we use published spectral types , as described in cody et al .",
    "for a few of the short - duration flux dip stars , we have derived spectral type estimates from our own spectra ( stauffer et al .",
    "where actual spectral types were not available , we have estimated spectral type by adopting the estimates for stellar luminosity and radius described in venuti et al .",
    "( 2014 ) ; combining those two quantities and the stefan - boltzmann law to estimate the effective temperature of the star ; and then using the spectral type to t@xmath57  conversion for young stars provided in pecaut & mamajek ( 2013 ) .",
    "we also provide h@xmath0 equivalent widths for the variable extinction and accretion burst members in the table , because those numbers are used in  3 .",
    "the h@xmath0 data are generally from the literature ( cody et al .",

    "our initial @xmath41  estimation begins by co - adding all epochs of spectra for each star to produce a high s / n mean spectrum .",
    "for the adopted spectral type for each star , we produce a synthetic spectrum at the flames spectral resolution , and then convolve that spectrum with a rotational broadening function , using software routines available in sme ( valenti & piskunov 1996 ) , synth3 and binmag3 ( kochukhov 2007 ) .",
    "we do this for a range in adopted rotational velocities , and compare the model spectra to the observed spectrum in a least - squares sense .",
    "the @xmath41  we adopt is that for the model whose spectrum matches most closely the observed spectrum .",
    "the formal uncertainties in the derived @xmath41 s are generally 2 @xmath12 3 .",
    "we note that the model spectra assume solar abundance , hence essentially no feature is present for the lithium 6708   doublet ; these @xmath41 s therefore are based on all the other absorption features in the flames h@xmath0 order .    after deriving @xmath41 s in this manner for all of our ngc  2264 ctts ,",
    "we plotted those @xmath41 s versus the mean fwhm of the lithium 6708   doublet for each star ( i.e. we measured the fwhm at each epoch , and then took the average of those values ; the fwhm for the stochastic stars ranges from 0.7   to 1.8  , with rms for the dozen or more epochs for a given star of order 0.03  ) .",
    "the plot shows the expected relationship , but with a larger than anticipated scatter for stars with small @xmath41 .",
    "as one approaches the resolution limit of the spectrograph , one of course expects an increase in scatter , but it was also possible that by averaging spectra for the @xmath41  analysis we could artifically broaden lines ( e.g. , for an sb1 ) .",
    "therefore , we adopted a second procedure to estimate @xmath41  based on combining the lithium fwhm data and the original @xmath41  data to provide a calibration . for this purpose ,",
    "we fit a calibration curve to the plot of @xmath41  versus fwhm .",
    "then , for each star , we used that calibration curve and the measured mean lithium fwhm to provide a new @xmath41  estimate . because the lithium 6708   line is always the strongest absorption feature in these spectra , for faint and/or slowly rotating stars , this latter @xmath41  estimate could be more reliable than the initial estimate .",
    "table  [ tab : other_data ] provides both @xmath41  estimates - column 7 provides the initial @xmath41  estimate , and column 8 the @xmath41  estimate derived from the measured lithium fwhm .",
    "comparison of the two @xmath41  estimates in table  [ tab : other_data ] shows generally good correspondence .",
    "however , a few stars show significant differences , with mon-1234 having the most significant discrepancy ( 24.0 vs. 15.9 ) .",
    "the spectral synthesis method yields essentially the same @xmath41  for mon-636 and mon-1234 , while the lithium fwhm method yields 24.9 and 15.9 , respectively . the mean and rms fwhm for the two stars are 0.827 @xmath58 0.036 and 0.725 @xmath58 0.024 , respectively , with none of the mon-1234 fwhm values being as large as the smallest fwhm measurement for mon-636 .",
    "the lithium widths preclude these stars from having the same @xmath41 .",
    "based on this and similar comparisons , we adopt the @xmath41 s derived from the lithium width as our best estimates of @xmath41 , and we use those estimates in the plots in the main body of the paper ."

    "<S> the most common feature of their h@xmath0 profiles is for them to exhibit blue - shifted absorption features , most likely originating in a disk wind . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of periodic signatures in the light curves suggests that little of the variability is due to long - lived hot spots rotating into or out of our line of sight ; instead , the primary driver of the observed photometric variability is likely to be instabilities in the inner disk that lead to variable mass accretion . </S>"
