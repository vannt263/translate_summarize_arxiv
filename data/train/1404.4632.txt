    "the transition from a neutral intergalactic medium ( igm ) to one that is ionized , and therefore transparent to ultraviolet photons , represents the latest frontier in our overall understanding of cosmic history .",
    "in addition to determining when this ` cosmic reionization ' occurred , a key question is the role of star - forming galaxies in governing the process .",
    "structure in the polarization of the cosmic microwave background suggests the reionization process occurred within the redshift interval @xmath7 @xcite and deep infrared imaging with hubble space telescope has provided the first opportunity to conduct a census of galaxies during the latter half of this period @xcite .",
    "recent progress in this area has been reviewed by @xcite and @xcite .    in the absence of significant numbers of high redshift qsos or gamma ray bursts ,",
    "the most immediately available probe of the evolving neutrality of the igm beyond @xmath8 is the visibility of the lyman alpha ( @xmath9 ) emission line in controlled samples of color - selected galaxies .",
    "although a prominent line in star - forming galaxies at @xmath10 , as ly@xmath11 is a resonant transition , it is readily suppressed by neutral gas , both in the host galaxy and , if present , in the surrounding igm . first proposed as a practical experiment using lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) by @xcite , the idea followed earlier theoretical work by @xcite , @xcite and others .",
    "ground - based near - infrared spectroscopic surveys have now targeted various samples of color - selected lyman break galaxies over @xmath6 allowing the construction of a redshift - dependent @xmath9  fraction , x@xmath0 , which falls sharply from a value of @xmath12 50% at @xmath13 @xcite to less than 10% at and beyond @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "although converting this downturn in the visibility of the line into the volume fraction of neutral hydrogen , x@xmath15 , is uncertain @xcite , the prospects for improving the statistics of this test are promising given the arrival of multi - object instruments such as mosfire on the keck 1 telescope @xcite .",
    "so far , this important measure of late reionization has been applied by adopting an empirical description of the demographics of ly@xmath11 emission in lbgs , parameterized according to the equivalent width ( ew ) distribution for various uv luminosities over the redshift range @xmath16 when the universe is fully ionized .",
    "the trend is then extrapolated to higher redshifts in the form of a ` no evolution ' prediction with the aim of rejecting this prediction at some level of significance ( e.g. @xcite ) . as we discuss here , this method ,",
    "now widely used , has several disadvantages . recognizing these and noting the spectroscopic and optical and near - infrared imaging data of lbgs over @xmath16 has improved in scope and quality , in this paper we adopt a more physically - based approach to the visibility of ly@xmath11 in the vicinity of the host galaxy .",
    "our new approach aims to predict its visibility in a high redshift galaxy on the basis of its measured uv continuum slope that , in turn , contains information on the dust content , and stellar population , which both directly influence the strength of any ly@xmath11 emission .",
    "this approach has the distinct advantage that , for the new @xmath2 samples being studied with mosfire and other spectrographs , composite uv slopes for the population are usually available so that unnecessary extrapolation can be avoided .",
    "the present paper is concerned with describing this improved ly@xmath11 fraction test and applying it to the first comprehensive set of spectroscopic data emerging from mosfire .",
    "in addition to incorporating the earlier surveys conducted with keck @xcite , and fors2 on the vlt @xcite , we present the first results from a survey of high quality ultra deep field ( udf ) targets which provides a valuable extension of the aforementioned studies . as part of this survey , we demonstrate a new ly@xmath11-emitting galaxy at a redshift @xmath17=7.62 extending once again the frontier of spectroscopically - confirmed hst sources .    a plan of the paper follows .",
    "in section 2 , we introduce our new method for the lyman alpha fraction test .",
    "section 3 introduces the new compilation of @xmath16 data drawn from our now completed keck spectroscopic survey @xcite , and section 4 contains an analysis of this data in the context of our new method . in section 5",
    "we introduce our new mosfire data and apply our new method to both this data and that obtained earlier .",
    "although the traditional ly@xmath11 fraction test as first proposed by @xcite has already provided meaningful constraints on the evolution of the igm beyond @xmath18 , there are two limitations in the current methodology .",
    "firstly , as inferring the presence of neutral gas in the intergalactic medium represents a differential measurement , it is necessary to assume a form of the distribution of the equivalent widths of ly@xmath11 emission _",
    "unprocessed by the igm _ for the galaxies at @xmath19 . comparing this to the observed distribution allows the extinction imposed by the igm , and through the application of theoretical models , the igm neutrality to be derived .",
    "the current methodology splits the sample into uv - luminous and uv - faint bins , and tracks the ly@xmath11 fraction in each bin as a function of redshift . the igm unprocessed distribution at @xmath20",
    "is then assumed to either be that observed at @xmath21 for each bin , or a linear extrapolation of the @xmath22 data .",
    "however as we can not observe the sample at @xmath23 in the absence of a neutral igm , we can never know which , if either , of these assumptions is correct .    secondly , the ew distribution used to predict the observable @xmath9  distribution has been characterized in many different ways , including an exponential @xcite , a direct histogram @xcite , a half gaussian @xcite and a half gaussian with a constant probability tail @xcite . though the distributions are largely similar , no detailed comparison has been performed to determine which one optimally represents the @xmath22 data .",
    "we perform this in the context of assembling our model in section [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "the most fundamental question , however , is whether the _ rest - frame uv luminosity _ is the optimum parameter to predict the visibility of ly@xmath11 in the absence of any suppression by a partly neutral igm . the approach , based on correlations first noted by @xcite , was adopted by @xcite as m@xmath24  can be readily determined from the available photometry of distant galaxies together with a photometric redshift .",
    "however , m@xmath24  is likely to be a coarse predictor of the ly@xmath11 ew as it ignores second order parameters such as metallicity , the stellar initial mass function and dust content .",
    "the _ uv continuum slope _ is a more natural choice as a basic variable as it encodes each of these physical properties @xcite .",
    "lower metallicity and hotter stars produce more ionizing photons per unit uv continuum , thus driving ew@xmath0  upwards .",
    "dust very efficiently absorbs @xmath9  photons given their large effective path lengths from the many scatterings required to escape an hii region .",
    "these changes also result in a bluer or redder uv continuum slope , respectively .",
    "thus , as the uv slope reflects more of the parameters that likely govern ew@xmath0 compared to m@xmath24 , we should expect it to be a more robust predictor of the visibility of the line in high redshift samples .",
    "until recently , determining the uv continuum slope was only possible for a restricted subset of @xmath25 @xmath26-dropouts .",
    "@xcite showed that within this subset , strong @xmath9  emitting galaxies have bluer uv continuum slopes than their non - emitting counterparts , but as there existed no high - quality infrared photometry in the goods fields at this time , it was necessary to parametrize distributions at higher redshift by their absolute magnitude .",
    "however , in addition to the now completed keck spectroscopic survey of lbgs over @xmath16 @xcite , the candels hst imaging program ( go 12444 - 5 , pi : ferguson / riess / faber ) provides the necessary data to explore the potential of the uv continuum slope as a predictor for ew@xmath0 .",
    "the addition of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29  photometric data enables the derivation of accurate uv continuum slopes for catalogued galaxies , given for each source there is a minimum of 3 broad - band filters longward of the lyman break . as such uv continuum slopes are now available for the growing body of @xmath2 photometric galaxy samples(e.g .",
    "@xcite ) , we can realize a ly@xmath11 fraction test that overcomes several of the issues associated with the earlier approach .    in the following",
    ", we discuss the new data for the keck @xmath16 spectroscopic sample @xcite and analyze it in the context of a distribution function based upon the observed uv continuum slopes of the population .",
    "we then apply the method to an updated sample of near - infrared spectroscopic data beyond @xmath30 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the @xmath16 lbg candidates which form the basis of the post - reionization sample were targeted in the goods - n and s fields using the deimos spectrograph on the keck 2 telescope .",
    "the final catalog is being prepared for release by @xcite . by retrospectively applying the same photometric selection criteria , a spectroscopic sample in the goods - s field using the fors2 spectrograph on the eso very large telescope",
    "was added ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "full details of these spectroscopic campaigns can be found in the above referenced articles .",
    "the goods - n sample consists of 393 lbg candidates targeted with deimos observed over the course of 2008 - 2010 .",
    "the targets include @xmath26-,@xmath31- , and @xmath32-drops , and the spectroscopically - confirmed sample spans a redshift range of @xmath33 .",
    "typical 10@xmath34 limiting ly@xmath11 fluxes for these targets ranged between 1.0 - 1.5 @xmath35 erg @xmath36s@xmath37 .",
    "the complementary fors2 campaign @xcite targeted 214 lbg candidates in goods - s between 2002 and 2006 .",
    "these targets were , on average , brighter than those studied at keck ( see @xcite , figure 2 ) , and the confirmed galaxies span a redshift range @xmath38 . in total , the sample comprises 607 galaxies , 269 of which are spectroscopically confirmed .",
    "we direct the reader to @xcite for further details .",
    "the primary advance in our analysis of the equivalent width distribution of ly@xmath11 in the above spectroscopic sample relates to the combination of the earlier hst acs optical imaging data with new , deep wfc3/ir near - infrared data critical to assessing how @xmath9  emission correlates with the measured uv continuum slope . to reliably bring together the various imaging datasets",
    ", it is necessary to account for the significantly different point - spread functions ( psfs ) between the acs ( fwhm @xmath39 0.09  ) and wfc3/ir ( fwhm @xmath39 0.16  ) instruments . in the goods - s field",
    ", we utilized the published , psf - matched catalog of @xcite which uses the publicly released v2.0 acs and v1.0 wfc3 images , constructs stellar profiles to derive the psfs in order to convolve the higher - resolution , shorter wavelength data , and performs isophotal photometry on the smoothed images .    for goods - n",
    ", we also utilized the publicly released v2.0 acs images , but as no candels wfc3/ir mosaic was released at the time of this analysis , we constructed our own . the first 13 ( out of 18 )",
    "epochs of goods - n observations , released as individual , v0.5 mosaics , were combined using the routine swarp @xcite with individual weights assigned according to the exposure time .",
    "psf matching was implemented using the _ colorpro _ program @xcite .",
    "a psf was constructed for each filter by shifting and stacking @xmath40 bright unsaturated stars .",
    "all objects were detected using the @xmath29  image , and colors were determined using matched isophotal apertures after degrading the resolutions of all other images to that of the @xmath29  image .",
    "the basis of our analysis relies on accurate determinations of both the ly@xmath11 equivalent widths ( ew@xmath0 ) , and ultraviolet slopes of our sample .",
    "thus , we detail here the methodology used in determining both these quantities for use in our analysis .    in order to measure the uv slope for each object in our sample ,",
    "we first used a custom photometric redshift code to determine the approximate redshifts of those galaxies without spectroscopic confirmation .",
    "the code fits a suite of synthetic fluxes from the bruzual - charlot ( bc03 , @xcite ) spectra to the available photometry . to determine the best - fit redshift",
    ", we marginalized across all other parameters ( mass , dust extinction , and age ) , and used the maximum likelihood value .",
    "we measure the uv continuum slope using the @xmath41 formalism first introduced by @xcite , where the flux is parametrized as @xmath42 . in our fitting process , we include photometric filters with central rest wavelengths within the range defined by @xcite , @xmath43@xmath44 .",
    "this range is also similar to that used previously in the literature @xcite . as in @xcite",
    ", we use the effective filter wavelengths appropriate for a @xmath45 spectrum , since the measured uv slopes in our sample generally populate the @xmath46 range , and an error floor of 0.05 mag , or @xmath47 , for all filters .",
    "a grid of power law slopes with @xmath48 and @xmath49 was fit to the observed photometry , and the relative likelihood of each computed using @xmath50 , appropriate for gaussian distributed errors .",
    "this allows us to construct a likelihood curve for the uv slope of each galaxy , central to the fitting method we describe later . after the fitting ,",
    "the image cutouts , photometry , and resulting @xmath51 were manually inspected for each galaxy , flagging and removing objects with clearly deviant photometry or incorrect solutions . after this process , 297 of our sample of 393 galaxies in goods - n , and 154 of our 214 galaxies in goods - s remained .",
    "galaxies removed were typically those adjacent to bright objects , for which accurate photometry could not be assured , and faint , distant @xmath52 galaxies that appeared in the shallower candels - wide field for which accurate uv slopes could not be determined .",
    "measurements of the @xmath9  ew were taken from @xcite with errors computed using both the @xmath53 flux errors in the spectrum , as well as errors in m@xmath24 , added in quadrature to produce a likelihood curve for @xmath54ew@xmath0@xmath55 . for cases where @xmath9  was not spectroscopically detected , we assume one of three cases : ( 1 ) the line flux falls below the @xmath56 limit ( typically 1.0 - 1.5 @xmath57 erg @xmath36s@xmath37 ) , ( 2 ) the line emission , though brighter than the 10@xmath58 limit is missed , due to poor sky subtraction or obscuration by skylines , or ( 3 ) the object is a contaminant outside the expected redshift range .",
    "we discuss the implementation of this approach in section 4.3.1 .    with these results in hand",
    ", we now provide the basic evidence that the uv continuum slope of a galaxy , @xmath41 , is a reliable predictor of its ly@xmath11 ew . in figure",
    "[ fig : lya_vs_beta ] , we plot the best fit @xmath41 for each galaxy in our final sample against either its ew@xmath0 , or its 10@xmath34 upper - limit , if a line is not detected .",
    "the red crosses denote the mean ew@xmath0 in bins spanning @xmath59 , where undetected objects are set to have a value of 0 .",
    "error bars for each bin are calculated by bootstrap sampling .    as shown from earlier work by @xcite and @xcite , a clear trend of increasing mean ew@xmath0  with bluer ( more negative ) uv slopes",
    "is visible . with our large spectroscopic sample ,",
    "this can be seen directly through the measures of individual objects , rather than via stacked spectra or consideration of average @xmath41 values .",
    "encouraged by this trend , we now develop a model that can predict the probability distribution of ew@xmath0   given a measured value of @xmath41 , for example for a @xmath2 galaxy . at the end of this section",
    ", we will also use this model to show that the uv slope is a more reliable predictor of ew@xmath0  than the absolute uv magnitude .",
    "we now seek to establish a formalism to predict the probability distribution for ew@xmath0  given a particular measured uv slope . as our goal is to improve the accuracy of the lyman alpha fraction test",
    ", we first consider those galaxies with blue uv slopes , likely to have strong ly@xmath11 emission before processing through the igm .      as an illustration of our new method we begin by examining the distribution of the ly@xmath11 ew for a fixed uv continuum slope , @xmath41 .",
    "a natural choice is @xmath60 given that @xcite find that faint ( m@xmath24@xmath61 ) , high - redshift ( @xmath62 ) galaxies have slopes that asymptote to this value . near - ir spectrographs such as mosfire have begun to target these galaxies in earnest ( this work , @xcite , @xcite ) , and it is becoming increasingly important to characterize their expected igm unprocessed @xmath9  emission . to construct a sample of galaxies for this task , we limit our overall sample of 468 galaxies with @xmath38 to those galaxies with a best fit value within @xmath63 of @xmath64 , resulting in a total of 131 objects .",
    "we now require a model to represent the igm unprocessed ew distribution . in appendix",
    "a , we review four such options using the methodology outlined here , and find that a lognormal distribution provides a significantly better fit than any of the others . in this case",
    "the natural logarithm of ew@xmath0 obeys a normal distribution .",
    "the two relevant parameters of the distribution , @xmath65 and @xmath34 , are typically referred to as the _ location parameter _ and _ scale parameter _ , respectively .",
    "they denote the mean of the natural log of ew@xmath0   and its variance .",
    "however , while the median of the distribution is given , as might be expected , by exp(@xmath65 ) , the mean is slightly larger at exp(@xmath66 ) .",
    "a third parameter , @xmath67 , determines the fraction of galaxies that have ew@xmath0  @xmath68 , as there is no reason a priori to expect all galaxies to display @xmath9  in emission .",
    "the resulting distribution can be written as :    @xmath69    in figure [ fig : longnorm_example ] , we illustrate how the ew@xmath0  probability distribution function , @xmath70(ew ) , and the @xmath9  fraction , x@xmath0 , change as these parameters are varied .",
    "we now describe the bayesian formalism we developed to evaluate the likelihood of the underlying parameters for our lognormal distribution , and determine which provides the best fit to the data .",
    "the entire set of spectroscopic @xmath9  observations is denoted as * obs * ; this contains the information for observations of each individual galaxy , obs@xmath71 .",
    "we can then denote the parameters for the model being fit as @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "our overall goal is to determine the probability distributions for the underlying parameters of each model , given our observations , i.e. @xmath73 . using bayes theorem , we can rewrite this as    @xmath74    here , @xmath75 represents our uniform priors for the underlying parameters , while the term on the right hand side represents the probability of our observations given the model parameters .",
    "for any single object in which we measure a definite ew@xmath0 , this posterior probability can be expressed as :    @xmath76    in the case of an object for which @xmath9  remains undetected above our ( @xmath56 ) limit , we compute the posterior probability as :    @xmath77    here , the first term represents the probability that the object intrinsically posses an ew@xmath0  below our detection limits , while the @xmath78 term takes into account incompleteness in the sample ( caused by skylines or , in some cases , poor background subtraction ) .",
    "contamination by low redshift sources is taken into account through the final term , @xmath79 .",
    "we assume modest values for our contamination terms of @xmath78 = @xmath79 = 0.05 , motivated by the completeness simulations of @xcite , and the lack of low - redshift interlopers found in other spectroscopic follow - up surveys @xcite . the full posterior distribution for the parameters",
    "can then be computed by multiplying the individual posterior probabilities for each object .",
    "this allows us to infer the most likely values on parameters , as well as their marginalized and un - marginalized errors .",
    "we display the best - fit distribution for our sample of 131 galaxies with @xmath80 , overplotted on a histogram of their ew@xmath0  detections and upper limits in figure [ fig : b23_hist ] .",
    "the best fit parameters are @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 . as we show in appendix a , this formalism is the best fit to our post - reionization data .",
    "now that we have determined the distribution which best fits the data at the key uv slope value of @xmath84 , we proceed with a more appropriate goal of determining the ew distribution across all values of @xmath41 .",
    "although faint galaxies at @xmath62 may asymptote to @xmath84 , the uv - bright galaxies almost certainly do not @xcite .",
    "in order to fully leverage the x@xmath0  test for the more luminous objects , we must use a model that determines the ew distribution across a wide range of @xmath41 .    to achieve this goal",
    ", we extend the bayesian formalism introduced above .",
    "the differences are twofold .",
    "firstly , we now include our entire sample of spectroscopically observed galaxies when fitting , rather than just those narrowly clustered around a particular value of @xmath41 .",
    "secondly , we must reconsider the nature of eqn .",
    "1 since it is clear that the ew distribution varies as a function of @xmath41 from figure [ fig : lya_vs_beta ] .",
    "it is most reasonable to consider that the _ location parameter _ , @xmath65 , varies with @xmath41 since it is this parameter that governs the redistribution of ews ( see figure 2 ) . for convenience",
    "we assume that @xmath65 varies linearly with @xmath41 , whence @xmath85 , where @xmath86 represents the location parameter at @xmath87 . prior to selecting this model",
    ", we performed similar fits to a narrow range in @xmath41 as in the above section , with different ranges in @xmath41 , and found that while the best fit for @xmath65 varied strongly with the uv slope , both @xmath34 and @xmath67 did not .",
    "figure [ fig : pew_cdf ] shows a representation of the product of the resulting formalism , while we detail the full results in appendix b. because our model treats the _ location parameter _ as a linear function of @xmath41 , we can generate an ew probability distribution function for any uv slope , although our sample only provides meaningful constraints in the observed range @xmath88 . in this figure , we plot 3 examples and their associated errors .",
    "of course , a measured uv slope for a high redshift galaxy has some error uncertainty , and thus its own probability distribution , @xmath51 . to obtain @xmath89 given our model , and an observation of @xmath41",
    ", we can marginalize over @xmath41 for each galaxy in the sample :    @xmath90      we now return to one of the assumptions motivating this paper .",
    "does parametrizing the likelihood of @xmath9  emission via the uv slope represent a statistically better option than the combination of absolute uv magnitude and redshift used in previous high - redshift @xmath9  studies ?",
    "since we can measure @xmath41 , m@xmath24 , ew@xmath0 and a photometric or spectroscopic redshift for 451 objects in our spectroscopic sample , we can directly address this question .    in the widely - used uv luminosity method , the dependence on m@xmath24  is handled in a discrete manner , assigning galaxies into one of two bins , depending on whether they are greater or less than m@xmath24  @xmath91 .",
    "x@xmath0  is also calculated in discrete bins at @xmath92 and 6 . for purposes of comparison",
    ", we use the bayesian formalism developed in this paper to generalize this to a continuous model . to do so ,",
    "we alter the definition of @xmath65 from @xmath93 to @xmath94 .",
    "this thus replaces the linear dependence of the location parameter , @xmath65 , on uv slope , with a bivariate linear dependence on uv magnitude and redshift .",
    "we then use the same fitting process to determine the optimal values for all parameters in the model .    to compare",
    "how well each of these two models fits the available data , we use the bayesian evidence ratio , or bayes factor .",
    "the evidence is a measure of how likely the data are , given the model , and can be expressed as an integration of the likelihood function over all possible values for each parameter in the model    @xmath95    evaluating this for both models yields a significant gain via a ratio of @xmath96 , showing convincing preference for the model based on @xmath41 compared to the earlier method .",
    "although the body of spectroscopic data targeting galaxies beyond @xmath97 in the reionization era remains sparse , it is growing rapidly , particularly through the advent of multi - slit near - infrared spectrographs such as mosfire .",
    "thus we are encouraged to apply our new method to such data .",
    "in addition to collating earlier relevant data available in the literature , we also present the first results from our new survey using mosfire .      as part of a long term survey targeting @xmath98 galaxies using the mosfire spectrograph on the keck i telescope , we have secured deep spectroscopic observations in both november 2013 and march 2014 targeting two different fields .",
    "one represents distant sources in a deep hst blank field with accurate photometric redshifts and the other targeted gravitationally - lensed sources with extensive multi - band photometry .      on the night of nov 5 , 2013 , we secured a total of 3.5 hours exposure in the hubble ultra deep field region of goods - south .",
    "observations were taken using 0.7  slits through intermittent high cirrus cloud and @xmath99  seeing .",
    "a total of 16 @xmath98 candidates were included on this mask selected from an initial list of @xmath100 targets from our udf12 campaign and the goods - s field @xcite , augmented with two additional @xmath101-drops outside the udf proper from @xcite .",
    "we used the photometric redshift code , described in section [ sec : analysis ] , to compute a redshift probability distribution for each object .",
    "the udf 2012 dataset@xcite ( go 12498 , pi ; ellis ) offers many distinct advantages for this first application of our method .",
    "foremost , by virtue of the extraordinarily deep optical and f105w data available , contamination by foreground objects , as determined by the photometric scatter simulations in @xcite is @xmath102 , down to the @xmath103 limit of our targets .",
    "this contrasts with the @xmath104 contamination rate affecting galaxies in the candels fields @xcite .",
    "secondly , as a result of a strategic deployment of near - infrared filters , our udf 2012 candidates have better defined redshift probability distributions , allowing us to more confidently exclude the possibility of @xmath9  emission in the event of a non - detection . the median 68@xmath105 confidence interval in photometric redshift for the udf 2012 objects on our mosfire mask is smaller by @xmath106 compared to our goods - s targets ( and most likely to earlier published blank field surveys - see  5.3 ) .    the final target selection for this aspect of our survey was arranged to formally maximize the expected number of detected lines , and thus our leverage in calculating x@xmath0 . as a first attempt",
    ", we used the @xmath21 histograms of @xcite to predict the distribution of ew@xmath0for each object , as a function of its uv magnitude .",
    "the fractional number of expected detections was calculated for each object , taking into account the photometric redshift distribution ( as our spectral coverage is incomplete ) , uv magnitude , and expected limiting flux for a likely mosfire exposure .",
    "this exercise resulted in the final list of 16 candidates presented in table 1 .",
    "over the course of our november and march observations , we also targeted 3 candidates with a photometric redshift @xmath107 from the clash hst survey ( go 12065 - 12791 pi ; postman ) as collated in @xcite .",
    "although these targets can only be surveyed individually , limiting our efficiency , as each is sampled with 8 hst filters at or longward of @xmath108  they have sharp redshift probability distributions , and well - determined uv slopes making them ideally suited for our new method .",
    "we first targeted the @xmath109 candidate in abell 611 on november 5 , 2013 , securing 1.1 hours of on - source integration in 0.8  seeing .",
    "a further 1.5 hours of integration was possible on march 5 , 2014 . in our march 2014 run , we also targeted candidates in rxj-1347 and macs-0647 for 1.0 hours each .",
    "typical seeing conditions for the march nights were 0.60 - 0.65  . for all data , we used a 2.5  ab dither pattern .",
    "full details of the 3 targets are presented along with our goods - s / udf 2012 sample in table 1 .",
    "the data was reduced using the publicly available mosfire data reduction pipeline .",
    "this pipeline first creates a median , cosmic - ray subtracted flat field image for each mask .",
    "wavelength solutions for each slit are fit interactively for the central pixel in each slit , then propagated outwards to the slit edges to derive a full wavelength grid for each slit .",
    "the sky background is estimated as a function of wavelength and time using a series of b - splines and subtracted from each frame .",
    "the nodded a - b frames are differenced , stacked , rectified and output for use along with inverse variance - weighted images used for error estimation .",
    "examination of our goods - s data revealed a gradual @xmath110 ",
    "( @xmath111 pixel ) drift in the spatial direction over the course of our integration , which needed to be corrected for .",
    "the drift was tracked using a @xmath28@xmath112 star conveniently placed on one slit .",
    "the intensity of the star allowed us to follow the extinction for each frame and eliminating those frames affected by significant extinction or drift , we secured 2.35 hours of useful exposure . due to this drift",
    ", the star on our original reduction displayed a somewhat greater fwhm of @xmath113  than any of our individual exposures , which typically had a fwhm @xmath114  . to correct this , we registered the relative positions of all frames by fitting a gaussian profile to star along the spatial axis .",
    "given the drift over the entire exposure , we then arranged the frames into three separate groups , with the spatial positions in all frames consistent to within @xmath115 pixel .",
    "each of the three frame groups was reduced individually using the same procedure described above . to produce our final science stack , the three reductions",
    "were then shifted by the appropriate integer number of pixels and coadded , weighting by exposure time . using this method",
    ", we were able to reduce the observed stellar fwhm to @xmath116  .",
    "our final mask reaches a median @xmath117 limiting sensitivity between skylines of @xmath118 erg @xmath36s@xmath37 .",
    "we note that approximately @xmath119 of the y - band spectral range is obscured by skylines at the mosfire resolution of r @xmath120 given our 0.7  slit width .",
    "we inspected the reduced , two - dimensional spectra of all 16 objects by eye to search for @xmath9  emission . from this , we were able to locate only a single candidate emission line .",
    "surprisingly , this emission line is located in one of our faintest targets , udf12 - 3313 - 6545 ( first identified by @xcite , @xcite ) , with a measured flux of @xmath121 erg @xmath36s@xmath37 .",
    "if the line is indeed @xmath9 , the galaxy lies at a spectroscopic redshift of @xmath122 , making it a promising candidate for the most distant spectroscopically - confirmed galaxy to date .",
    "we present the relevant details and hst cutouts of this galaxy in figure [ fig : udf_40242_sed ] .    given the faintness ( the emission line is detected at @xmath123 ) , line asymmetry , commonly used to distinguish @xmath9 , is not detectable .",
    "however , the fact that the line displays a clear positive signal flanked by two negative peaks indicates that the signal was present in both the a and b exposure positions .",
    "although the line has a surprisingly large rest - frame equivalent width of @xmath124  , this is comparable to some discovered in @xmath21 @xmath9  emitting galaxies @xcite .",
    "notably , the spectroscopic redshift lies well within to the @xmath125 confidence interval of our derived photometric redshift distribution when line emission is accounted for , instilling further confidence in the redshift .      in order to achieve the most up - to - date and precise measurement of the @xmath9   opacity at @xmath126 , we have compiled a comprehensive sample of other near - infrared surveys for @xmath9  at high redshift , which we will utilize in our analysis",
    "this includes our own prior work with keck s nirspec @xcite , as well as a number of other surveys , using red - sensitive optical detectors on the vlt and keck @xcite , as well as independent work by treu and collaborators using nirspec @xcite and mosfire @xcite .    in total",
    ", this literature sample comprises 83 @xmath126 galaxies for which follow - up spectroscopy at various depths has been attempted , plus an additional 19 from this work . to apply our method",
    ", we split this sample into two redshift bins centered at @xmath20 and @xmath127 .",
    "the manner in which targets were assigned to each bin required careful consideration given the limited wavelength response of each instrument with respect to the photometric redshift likelihood distribution @xmath128 . rather than binning on photometric redshift alone , we carefully considered the redshift range within which a null detection could be determined .",
    "if the median redshift for which a null detection could be determined was less than ( greater than ) @xmath129 , we place the object in the @xmath130 bin .",
    "to predict the number of detections expected in an igm with no additional opacity to @xmath9 , we use a similar monte carlo method to that developed in @xcite .",
    "this simulation has three key inputs for each object : flux limits as a function of wavelength from the spectroscopic observations , which also take into account the night sky emission , a photometric redshift probability distribution , and a prediction for the igm unprocessed ew@xmath0   ( and thus @xmath131 ) distribution .    for objects observed in either this paper , or @xcite , flux limits as a function of wavelength",
    "were calculated directly from the reduced spectra by computing the variance in an aperture of 10   spectral extent . for the data in @xcite and",
    "@xcite we rescaled our flux limits from nirspec and mosfire , respectively , to match the quoted limits in the paper for each object . for @xcite , we did the same with our lris limits , as presented in @xcite .",
    "we used the published photometry from each paper ( and our own here ) in conjunction with our photometric redshift code described previously to determine a photometric redshift distribution for each object .",
    "the only exceptions are for the samples from @xcite and @xcite , for which either photometry or coordinates were not available . for these objects",
    ", we used the photometric redshift distribution for ground - based @xmath17-drops from @xcite .",
    "finally , for the objects in our new mosfire survey , we generated the prediction for the igm unprocessed ew@xmath0  distribution using the observed uv slope , as described in section [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "ideally , we would prefer to use this new method for all objects in the combined sample , in order to eliminate the potential bias of simply using m@xmath24  as a predictor .",
    "however , with the exception of galaxies in the udf 2012 field and clash lensed sample , the requisite 3 infrared photometric data points longward of the lyman break essential for achieving an accurate measure of @xmath41 are not available .",
    "thus , for all other objects , we must predict ew@xmath0  as a function of m@xmath24  from @xcite , using the data presented in @xcite .",
    "as an illustrative exercise , we also generated a prediction for the igm unprocessed ew@xmath0  distribution of these objects using their m@xmath24  to calculate a @xmath41 derived from the m@xmath24-@xmath41 relation at @xmath20 from @xcite .",
    "though not plotted , these results are available in table [ table : mc_results ] .    with these inputs , we conduct a monte carlo simulation . in each trial for a given object ,",
    "we draw a redshift from the photometric redshift distribution , and a @xmath9  equivalent width from the ew@xmath0  distribution . from the observed photometry ,",
    "this ew@xmath0  is converted to a flux .",
    "we then sample the spectroscopic flux limit at the redshift drawn to determine if the emission line would be observed at @xmath132 .",
    "this process is then repeated with @xmath133 trials for each object .      before considering the total sample ( i.e. including previous data from the literature ) , we compare the difference in the expected @xmath9  statistics for the high redshift sample using either m@xmath24  or @xmath41 as the basis for predicting the igm unprocessed ew@xmath0  distribution . since only the udf 2012 and clash surveys currently have accurate individual measurements of @xmath41 , this comparison",
    "can only be done for the 13 targets from our recent mosfire survey .",
    "the number of expected detections is compared in figure [ fig : beta_muv_comp ] .",
    "although hampered by limited statistics , the difference is still significant . using @xmath41 as a basis",
    ", we predict an average of 1.4 more detections than using m@xmath24 .",
    "this difference represents an important correction of a systematic error in the prior x@xmath0  tests .",
    "our new results show that the m@xmath24  method , for this specific sample of 13 targets , significantly underpredicts the incidence of igm unprocessed @xmath9  emission , which results in an overestimate of the igm transmission .",
    "the difference in predicted detections is dependent upon the properties of the sample considered but , as the objects probed from the both the udf and clash are intrinsically faint , with blue uv slopes , it is not surprising that the difference is so great .",
    "this change in predicted @xmath9  emission has important consequences for the transmission fraction of the igm implying a lower limit on the neutral fraction that is a factor 0.16 larger .",
    "clearly , for a given survey , our new @xmath41 method for predicting the igm unprocessed ew@xmath0  distribution has significant advantages , and reduces a key systematic error .",
    "this will be especially relevant for spectroscopic follow - up of the hst frontier fields ( go:13496 , pi : lotz ) , and their parallels , given these fields will have full coverage with the same four wfc3/ir filters used for the udf .",
    "we can now combine the various subsamples , our own mosfire survey and that from diverse sources in the literature .",
    "the net result is a histogram of the number of @xmath117 detections overall .",
    "these histograms are displayed , both for the @xmath20 and @xmath127 samples in figure [ fig : pred_det_all ] ; our new mosfire survey is , by design , more effective in constraining the higher redshift limits .",
    "we see evidence for a moderate decline in the lyman alpha fraction at @xmath20 and a continued sharper decline at higher redshift .",
    "note that our new spectroscopic confirmation at @xmath122 is not included as a detection as it lies below the a priori @xmath117 flux limit .",
    "as an illustration , we can convert these observational - based results to an igm extinction of @xmath9  by adopting the model used in @xcite appropriate for patchy reionization . in this model ,",
    "the igm is partially opaque , such that @xmath9  escapes to the observer unattenuated from a fraction , @xmath134 , of galaxies , while it is completely extinguished by the igm in a fraction @xmath135 .",
    "given the histogram of expected detections and the number actually observed , we infer a probability distribution for this transmission fraction , @xmath134 . at @xmath20 , we find @xmath136 , and at @xmath127 , a @xmath53 upper limit of @xmath137 . the full results can be found in table [ table : mc_results ] and are plotted along with the lower redshift data on x@xmath0  in figure [ fig : xlya_vs_z ] .    discussing the uncertainties in the transformation from transmission fraction to x@xmath15  is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "however , clearly this conversion is dependent upon a number of physical parameters , some internal to the galaxy , and others from the igm state itself .",
    "these include the velocity offset of @xmath9  from the galaxy s systemic velocity ( e.g. @xcite ) , the ionizing photon escape fraction @xcite , as well as the possible presence of optically thick absorption systems @xcite .",
    "until the theoretical models converge , and/or observations of these key quantities are available , absolute measures of the neutral fraction will still be subject to systematic errors .",
    "nonetheless , we have demonstrated substantial observational progress with our new survey and improved methodology , reducing one of the key systematic errors . using the models of @xcite here to provide an estimate of x@xmath15",
    ", we find x@xmath15  @xmath138 at @xmath20 , and x@xmath15  @xmath139 at @xmath127 .",
    "using our sample of 451 @xmath22 spectroscopically followed - up lyman break galaxies , we demonstrate an improved correlation between the ultraviolet continuum slope of a galaxy , @xmath41 , and its @xmath9  emission strength .",
    "given the availability of deep wfc3 photometry for both the goods - n and s fields , this progress follows measurements for many individual galaxies in this redshift range , rather than via stacked or averaged uv slopes , as in earlier work @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that this correlation with the presence of @xmath9  is stronger and more physically - motivated than that based on the uv luminosity and thus provides a natural basis for an improved model for the @xmath9  fraction test , now widely used to measure the evolving neutrality of the @xmath100 igm .",
    "we demonstrate the benefits of this new model using a new mosfire spectroscopic survey of @xmath3 targets from the ultra deep field 2012 catalog and clash lensing survey , and combine this with data at these redshifts already published in the literature . as a result",
    "we present the implications of the most comprehensive search for @xmath9  emission at @xmath140 to date , confirming once again important evidence that cosmic reionization ended at redshifts @xmath141 .    as a byproduct we also present the @xmath142 confirmation of @xmath9  in a galaxy at @xmath122 , likely the most distant spectroscopically - confirmed galaxy .",
    "we thank chuck steidel and ian mclain for their sterling efforts in developing the highly successful mosfire instrument .",
    "we also wish to recognize and acknowledge the very signicant cultural role and reverence that the summit of mauna kea has always had within the indigenous hawaiian community .",
    "we are most fortunate to have the opportunity to conduct observations from this mountain .",
