    "in this talk some results following from the covariant quark - parton model ( qpm ) will be shortly discussed , details of the model can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite . in this version of qpm valence quarks",
    "are considered as quasifree fermions on mass shell .",
    "momenta distributions describing the quark intrinsic motion have spherical symmetry corresponding to the constraint @xmath0 , which represents the total angular momentum - generally consisting of spin and orbital parts .",
    "i shall mention the following items :    \\1 . what sum rules follow from this approach for the spin structure functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 ?",
    ". how can these structure functions be obtained from the valence quark distributions @xmath4 and @xmath5 - if the @xmath6 symmetry is assumed ?",
    "the results are compared with the existing experimental data .",
    "why the first moment @xmath7 calculated in this approach can be substantially less , than the corresponding moment calculated within the standard , non covariant qpm , which is based on the infinite momentum frame ?",
    "recently , this model was generalized to include also the transversity distribution , for details i refer to @xcite .",
    "the model is based on the set of distribution functions @xmath8 , which measure probability to find a quark in the state:@xmath9where@xmath10 coincides with the direction of the proton polarization @xmath11",
    ". correspondingly , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are quark mass and momentum , similarly @xmath14 and @xmath15 for the proton .",
    "*  * with the use of these distribution functions one can define the function @xmath16 , which in the target rest frame reads:@xmath17where @xmath18 represent the charges of the proton valence quarks . in the paper @xcite",
    "i shown , how from the generic function @xmath16 the spin structure functions can be obtained .",
    "if one assume @xmath19 then:@xmath20@xmath21which implies@xmath22let me remark , that procedure for obtaining the functions @xmath23 from the distribution @xmath16 is rather complex , nevertheless the task is well - defined and unambiguous .",
    "resulting structure functions are related to a naive qpm , in which the relativistic kinematics and spheric symmetry ( which follows from the requirement @xmath0 ) are consistently applied .",
    "both these requirements are very important .",
    "one can observe , that the functions above have the same general form@xmath24and differ only in kinematic term @xmath25 .",
    "this integral , due to spheric symmetry and presence of the @xmath26function term , can be expressed as a combination of the momenta : @xmath27one can prove @xcite , that these functions satisfy@xmath28this relation then gives possibility to obtain integral relations between different functions having form ( [ s2 ] ) or ( [ s1 ] ) , in particular for @xmath29 and @xmath30 one gets :    @xmath31@xmath32and for limiting case @xmath33:@xmath34@xmath35obviously , the first relation is the known expression for wanzura - wilczek twist-2 term for @xmath3 approximation @xcite .",
    "further , if one define @xmath36then one can prove that @xmath37 dx=\\left\\langle x^{\\alpha } \\right\\rangle \\frac{\\alpha + 1}{\\left ( \\alpha + 2\\right ) \\left ( \\alpha + 3\\right ) } , \\]]@xmath38for _ any _ @xmath39 , for which the integrals exist . apparently these relations imply@xmath40 dx=0,\\]]which for @xmath41 corresponds to the wanzura - wilczek sum rules @xcite .",
    "other special cases correspond to the burkhardt - cottingham ( @xmath42 )  @xcite and the efremov - leader - teryaev ( elt , @xmath43 ) @xcite sum rules .",
    "let me point out , that all these rules here were obtained only on the basis of covariant kinematics and requirement of rotational symmetry .",
    "now i shall try to apply the suggested approach to the description of the real proton . for simplicity",
    "i assume :    \\1 ) spin contribution from the sea of quark - antiquark pairs and gluons can be neglected , so the proton spin is generated only by the valence quarks .",
    "\\2 ) in accordance with the non - relativistic _",
    "su(6 ) _ approach , the spin contribution of individual valence terms is given by fractions:@xmath44if the symbols @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote momenta distributions of the valence quarks in the proton rest frame , which are normalized as@xmath47then the generic distribution ( [ t4 ] ) reads@xmath48    in the paper @xcite , using a similar approach ,",
    "i studied also the unpolarized structure functions .",
    "structure function @xmath49 can be expressed as@xmath50on the other hand , for proton valence quarks one can write@xmath51so combination of the last two relations gives:@xmath52since this is again the integral having the structure ( [ s1 ] ) , one can apply the technique of integral transforms and ( instead of relation between @xmath53 and @xmath3 ) obtain the relations between @xmath54 and @xmath55 . for @xmath33",
    "these relations read : @xmath56 , \\]]@xmath57 .\\]]now , taking quark charges and corresponding @xmath58 factors as in eq .",
    "( t71 ) , one can directly calculate @xmath23 only using the input on the valence quark distribution @xmath59 . in fig .",
    "[ gps1 ] the results of @xmath2 and @xmath3 calculation are shown .",
    "experimental data on @xmath53 are represented by the new parameterization of the world data e155g1 and the @xmath3 points are data of the e155 collaboration e155g2 .",
    "more detailed discussion of these figures is done in @xcite , in this talk i want concentrate on the discussion and explanation , why intrinsic quark motion substantially reduces the first moment of the spin function @xmath2 . in @xcite it is shown , that    @xmath60    which , in the @xmath58 approach gives@xmath61where left limit is valid for the static ( @xmath62 ) and right one for massless quarks ( @xmath33 ) . in other words , it means : @xmath63this is a mathematical result , but how to understand it from the point of view of physics ?",
    "first , forget structure functions for a while and calculate completely another task .",
    "let me remind general rules concerning angular momentum in quantum mechanics :    \\1 ) angular momentum consist of orbital and spin part : * j = l+s *    \\2 ) in the relativistic case * l * and * s * are not conserved separately , only total angular momentum * j * is conserved .",
    "so , one can have pure states of @xmath64 only , which are for fermions with @xmath65 represented by the relativistic spheric waves , see e.g. @xcite :    @xmath66@xmath67this wavefunction is simplified for the state with total angular momentum ( spin ) equal 1/2 :    @xmath68@xmath69which gives@xmath70let me remark , that @xmath71 is minimum angular momentum for particle with @xmath72 now , one can easily calculate the average contribution of the spin operator to the total angular momentum :    @xmath73@xmath74\\]]if @xmath75 is the probability amplitude of the state @xmath76 , then @xmath77which means , that :    _ i ) _ for the fermion at rest ( @xmath78 ) we have @xmath79 which is quite comprehensible , since without kinetic energy no orbital momentum can be generated .",
    "_ ii ) _  for the state",
    "in which @xmath80 , we have in general : @xmath81where left limit is valid for the energetic fermion , @xmath82 . in other words , in the states @xmath76 with @xmath83 part of the total angular momentum @xmath71 is _ necessarily _ created by orbital momentum .",
    "this is a simple consequence of quantum mechanics .",
    "now , one can compare integrals ( [ v1 ] ) and ( [ v2 ] ) .",
    "since both integrals involve the same kinematic term , the interpretation of dependence on ratio @xmath84 in ( [ v2 ] ) is valid also for ( [ v1 ] ) . otherwise , the comparison is a rigorous illustration of the statement , that @xmath85 measures contributions from quark spins ( and not their total angular momenta ) .    in which point",
    "the present approach differ from standard qpm ?",
    "standard approach is closely connected with the preferred reference frame - infinite momentum frame .",
    "the basic relations like @xmath86are derived with the use of approximation@xmath87 in the covariant formulation this relation is equivalent to the assumption , that the quarks are static . in the presented covariant approach quarks are not static , so this approximation can not be used . as a result",
    ", different relations between the distribution and structure functions and also different behavior of @xmath7 are obtained .",

    "the main results are :    \\1 ) spin functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 depend on intrinsic motion .",
    "in particular , the momenta @xmath7 corresponding to the static ( massive ) fermions and massless fermions , can differ significantly : @xmath89 .",
    "it is due to splitting of angular momentum into spin and orbital part , as soon as intrinsic motion is present .",
