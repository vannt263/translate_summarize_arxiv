    "in the so - called unitary limit of a quantum bose or fermi gas , the scattering length @xmath8 diverges .",
    "this occurs at a fixed point of the renormalization group , thus these systems provide interesting examples of interacting , scale - invariant theories with dynamical exponent @xmath0 , i.e. non - relativistic .",
    "they can be realized experimentally by tuning the scattering length to @xmath9 using a feshbach resonance .",
    "( see for instance @xcite and references therein . )",
    "they are also thought to occur at the surface of neutron stars .",
    "these systems have also attracted much theoretical interest@xcite .",
    "there have even been some proposals to use the ads / cft correspondence to learn about these models@xcite .",
    "because of the scale - invariance , the only length scales in the problem are based on the density @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the spatial dimension , and the thermal wavelength @xmath12 .",
    "equivalently , the only energy scales are the chemical potential @xmath13 and the temperature @xmath14 .",
    "the problem is challenging since there is no small paramater to expand in such as @xmath15 .",
    "any possible critical point must occur at a specific value of @xmath16 .",
    "this can be translated into universal values for @xmath17 , or for fermions universal values for @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the fermi energy .",
    "for instance the critical point of an ideal bose gas is the simplest example , where @xmath20 .",
    "the present work is the sequel to @xcite , where we used the s - matrix based formulation of the quantum statistical mechanics developed in@xcite .",
    "this approach is very well - suited to the problem because in the unitary limit the s - matrix @xmath21 , and kernels in the integral equations simplify .",
    "in fact , this approach can be used to develop an expansion in @xmath22 .",
    "the main formulas for the 2 and 3 dimensional cases of both bosons and fermions were presented , however only the 2-dimensional case was analyzed in detail in @xcite . here",
    "we analyze the 3-dimensional case .",
    "the models considered are the simplest models of non - relativistic bosons or fermions with quartic interactions .",
    "the bosonic model is defined by the action for a complex scalar field @xmath23 .",
    "[ bosonaction ] s = d^3 dt @xmath24 for fermions , due to the fermionic statistics , one needs at least a 2-component field @xmath25 : [ fermionaction ] s = d^3 dt @xmath26 in both cases , positive @xmath27 corresponds to repulsive interactions .",
    "the bosonic theory only has a @xmath28 symmetry .",
    "the fermionic theory on the other hand has the much larger so(5 ) symmetry .",
    "this is evident from the work@xcite which considered a relativistic version , since the same arguments apply to a non - relativistic kinetic term .",
    "this is also clear from the work@xcite which considered an @xmath29-component version with sp(2n ) symmetry , and noting that sp(4 ) = so(5 ) .",
    "the interplay between the scattering length , the bound state , and the renormalization group fixed point was discussed in detail from the point of view of the s - matrix in @xcite . in 3 spatial dimensions",
    "the fixed point occurs at negative coupling @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is an ultra - violet cut - off . for @xmath27 less than @xmath32",

    "the bound state disappears at @xmath32 .",
    "when @xmath27 approaches @xmath32 from above , the scattering length goes to @xmath34 , and this is referred to as the bcs side . in this paper",
    "we work on the bcs side of the cross - over since the bound state does not have to be incorporated into the thermodynamics . on this side",
    "the interactions are effectively attractive .",
    "theoretical studies have mainly focussed on the fermionic case , and for the most part at zero temperature , which is appropriate for a large fermi energy .",
    "the bosonic case has been less studied , since a homogeneous bosonic gas with attractive interactions is thought to be unstable against mechanical collapse , and the collapse occurs before any kind of bec .",
    "the situation is actually different for harmonically trapped gases , where bec can occur@xcite .",
    "however studies of the homogeneous bosonic case were based on a small , negative scattering length@xcite , and it is not clear that the conclusions reached there can be extrapolated to the unitary limit .",
    "since the density of collapse is proportional to @xmath22@xcite , extrapolation to infinite scattering length suggests that the gas collapses at zero density , which seems unphysical , since the gas could in principle be stabilized at finite temperature by thermal pressure .",
    "one can also point out that in the van der waals gas , the collapse is stabilized by a finite size of the atoms , which renders the compressibility finite . in the unitary limit",
    ", there is nothing to play such a role . in the sequel we will present evidence that the unitary bose gas undergoes bec when @xmath3",
    "this lower value is consistent with the attractive interactions .",
    "we also estimate the critical exponent describing how the compressibility diverges at the critical point .",

    "motivated by the conjectured lower bound@xcite for the ratio of the viscosity to entropy density @xmath36 for relativistic systems , we study this ratio for both the fermionic and bosonic cases in section vi .",
    "our results for fermions are consistent with experiments , with @xmath37 times the conjectured lower bound . for bosons ,",
