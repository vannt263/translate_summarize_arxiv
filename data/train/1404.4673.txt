    "<S> the system is also strongly dissipative in the sense that , for large @xmath26 the dominant process is the one ruled by @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> if the system is initialized in one of its steady states , on general physical grounds one expects the system , for small @xmath27 to stay within the ssm with high probability . </S>",

    "<S> the meaning of this quantity is that the time - scale @xmath48 sets a lower bound to the relaxation time of the irreversible process described by @xmath11 since @xmath49 if no nilpotent blocks are present in the spectral resolution of @xmath24 @xcite the leakage outside the ssm becomes negligible when @xmath50 namely when the time - scale @xmath20 is much longer that the relaxation time @xmath48 i.e. , dissipation is much faster than the coherent part of the dynamics . </S>",

    "<S> an immediate corollary of ( [ projection - th ] ) is that @xmath56 , namely the probability of leaking outside of the ssm , induced by the unitary term @xmath57 for large @xmath26 is smaller than @xmath58 the constant @xmath59 controls the strength of the deviations from the ideal adiabatic behavior at finite @xmath20 [ the rhs of ( [ projection - th ] ) ] and it can be related to the spectral structure of @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> roughly speaking , one expects @xmath60 and therefore violations of adiabaticity , to increase when the dissipative gap @xmath61 decreases . </S>",
