    "the description of the composite systems of branes @xcite in terms of the source and probe ( s , p ) configurations has proved itself as a useful technique for investigating about some of the features of the intersecting brane configurations @xcite .",
    "as has been analyzed in @xcite , describing a system of branes in this manner , one can find a subset of the ` field constraints ' ( the no - force conditions ) that fix the supergravity solution for a ` marginal ' configuration of ` flat ' intersecting or overlapping branes .",
    "moreover , by this analysis several ` algebraic constraints ' , arising naturally as a the ` consistency conditions ' in the study of the supergravity field equations , acquire interpretations as the conditions for balancing several internal long - range forces against each other .",
    "equivalently , one can interpret them as the balancing conditions for the forces acting between the whole of the brane system and external brane probes of different types and orientations similar to those of the brane system @xcite .",
    "a similar approach in systems of branes at angles reveals that the only _ marginal _ configurations with flat branes at ( non - trivial ) angles are those constructed from similar branes with two angles in a subgroup of @xmath2 @xcite . from the viewpoint of the supergravity theory , these configurations preserve 1/4 of the spacetime susy @xcite .",
    "there exist , however , other configurations of intersecting branes making more than two angles , but still preserve some fraction of susy @xcite .",
    "these configurations are stable only when certain relations ( which embody the above @xmath2 relation ) hold between their angles @xcite .",
    "such configurations , are found in @xcite that , can not be made up of a set of flat p - branes .",
    "indeed , they consist of a set of curved p - branes which only asymptotically look like the flat intersecting ( overlapping ) branes with definite angles",
    ". this agrees with a result of @xcite that the supergravity solutions for the _ non - orthogonal _ intersecting branes of the distributed type at _ non _ @xmath2 angles are not realizable in terms of a set of harmonic functions .",
    "however , the existence of such ` curved intersections ' raises the question of finding the corresponding worldvolume solutions .",
    "this generally defines a difficult problem which involves solving simultaneously the coupled set of the supergravity and the worldvolumes field equations . as everybody knows ,",
    "even the much simpler but analogous problem for two charged particles in a flat spacetime has not an exact solution . in a limiting case , however , the problem is simplified and can be handled using the s - p description .",
    "this is the viewpoint that we shall follow in this paper to study a special class of the curved configurations which we name as the ` mono - dimensional ' solutions .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : the general set up of the problem together with the required notations are given in section 2 .",
    "then in section 3 , the symmetries of the worldvolume theory and its noether currents , in connection to a class of its solutions named as the ` orbits ' , are studied .",
    "sections 4,5,6 are devoted to a detailed analysis of the orbits in three different cases of the source and probe dimensions on the basis of the conservation equations given in section 3 .",
    "the paper ends with some concluding remarks in section 7 .",
    "the basic principle in the analysis of any system of ( s , p)-branes ( as the source and probe respectively ) is that , while the worldvolume geometry of the p - brane is essentially determined by the fields that originate from the s - brane , the latter is not influenced in any way by the presence of the former . in analogy to classical mechanics , such a condition corresponds to a limiting case in which one of the branes , labeled by s , has a considerable mass relative to the other brane which is labeled by p. in the case of bps ( 1/2 susy ) branes , one knows that each of the branes has a mass and charge in proportion to its tension @xmath3 or @xmath4 @xcite ; so in suitable units one must require that @xmath5 .",
    "there are other occasions , however , that while this condition on tensions is not necessarily satisfied , the description as a ( s , p ) system still is reliable .",
    "an interesting example of such occasions is a marginally bound bps configuration of two flat p - branes which are characterized by certain no - force conditions among themselves @xcite . in general , a bps - brane with a small ( extrinsic ) curvature in the background of another such flat brane , both together , can be treated ( in this same order ) as a pair of ( p , s)-branes .",
    "another application concerns the near to the intersection points of two p - branes where one can neglect the self - interactions of each brane in comparison to its interactions with the other brane . in usual ,",
    "a flat p - brane of the bps type is a classically stable object , which obeys certain no - force conditions preventing its collapse due to its self - gravitational forces .",
    "when the p - brane is curved , the self - interaction forces counterbalance each other and the oscillations initiate . in a s - p description , however , we deal with a limiting case in which all of the ` self - oscillations ' of the p - brane , as well as its curving effects on the geometry of the s - brane , are totally negligible . as a result , the analysis for a s - p configuration with a pair of bps - branes proceeds via studying the worldvolume ( dbi+wz ) action of the p - brane , in which the background fields are replaced by the fields associated to a flat and fixed s - brane . in general",
    ", the analysis depends on the ` types ' of the two branes which - as far as concerns to us- are specified by their dimensions , ` electric ' or ` magnetic ' nature and couplings to the dilaton field . for the purpose of this paper",
    "we restrict our study to the case with both electric - type ( s , p)-branes and distinguish between several cases by the relative status of the worldvolume dimensions @xmath6 of these two branes .",
    "+ to begin with , we recall that the general supergravity background for a ( bps ) @xmath7-brane source consists of @xcite & & ds^2=h^d/(h^-1_dx^dx^ + _ mndy^mdy^n ) + & & e^=h^ + & & = h^-1_=0^d-1dx^ [ 1 ]    here @xmath8 and @xmath9 are parallel and transverse coordinates of the s - brane , and @xmath10 is a harmonic function : h(y)=\\ {    lll 1+q/ |y|^ & , & 0 + -q|y| & , & = 0    . [ 2 ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 is ( proportional to ) the form - field charge of the brane .",
    "all other notations are those of @xcite , in particular : @xmath13 , d is the spacetime dimension and @xmath14 is a measure of coupling between @xmath15 and @xmath16 in supergravity , which is related to @xmath17 as : @xcite ^2(d)=1-d/2[a]on the other hand the worldvolume action for a @xmath7-brane probe ( having equal mass and charge in units with @xmath18 ) has the general form @xcite : s_d =- t_dd^de^- det^1/2(g^*_ab)+t_d^*_(d ) [ 3 ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are pull - backs of the spacetime metric and the @xmath17-form potential , on the @xmath17-volume of the probe , respectively . depending on that @xmath21 or @xmath22 , the last ( wz ) term has a non - vanishing or vanishing contribution to @xmath23 .",
    "this action describes the dynamics of the embedding coordinates @xmath24 through the dependences of @xmath25 on these coordinates .",
    "in the following sections , however , we use a subset @xmath26 of the spacetime coordinates @xmath27 ( parallel or perpendicular to the source ) to parameterize the worldvolume of the p - brane and use the remaining subset @xmath28 as the embedding coordinates [ so , @xmath29 .",
    "the above action then reads s_d = t_dd^dx(y^a,_ay^a ) [ 4 ] where the form of the embedding lagrangian ( @xmath30 ) changes depending on the relative status of @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( see below ) .",
    "without going to the detailed expression of @xmath30 in the specific cases , the flat geometry of the s - brane a priori implies that this lagrangian must possess a number of obvious global symmetries .",
    "these symmetries include the translational and rotational invariances along the worldvolume of the s - brane as well as the rotational invariance along its transverse directions which are respectively defined as : x^=^ & , & y^m = 0 [ 5 ] + x^=^_x^ & , & y^m = 0 ( _+_=0 ) [ 6 ] + x^=0 & , & y^m = _mny^n ( _mn+_nm=0 ) [ 7 ]    though all of these symmetries have natural interpretations as the spacetime ( bulk ) symmetries , in the worldvolume theory some of them are realized as pure internal symmetries changing @xmath33 s but not affecting on @xmath34 .",
    "the three cases with @xmath35 are common in the above symmetries , though they are different in the way that one defines @xmath36 . in each of the above cases they are defined as follows : & & d_s = d_p : x^=x^a ,",
    "y^m = y^a + & & d_s > d_p : x^=(x^a , y^i ) , y^m = y^a + & & d_s < d_p : x^a=(x^,y^i ) , y^m=(y^a , y^i ) [ 9]here @xmath37 represents a subset of the coordinates parallel ( perpendicular ) to the s - brane which we shall take them as a part of the parameterizing ( embedding ) coordinates , in the case with @xmath38 . the corresponding noether currents for each of these cases",
    "are then constructed using the formula @xcite : ^a=(y^a - x^b_by^a)+x^a [ 8 ] the conservation equations of the noether currents are useful tools in the analysis of the classical solutions of the worldvolume theory ( [ 4 ] ) for a particular class of them depending only on a single space or time coordinate . for the reason that becomes clear , we refer to such solutions as the ` orbits ' of the p - brane and denote by @xmath39 the space or time coordinate that parameterizes an orbit .",
    "for such a configuration , the action ( [ 4 ] ) for the worldvolume field theory reduces to a mechanical type action of the form s = dxl(y^a , y^a ) [ 10]where @xmath40 , and @xmath41 ( up to a constant factor ) is the same as @xmath42 in which all derivatives of @xmath43 other than @xmath44 are set equal to zero . depending on that @xmath39",
    "is a space- or time - like coordinate the resulting solution has a different interpretation .",
    "when @xmath39 is space - like , @xmath45 describes a cylindrical static configuration of the p - brane , whose all directions except one are parallel to the s - brane .",
    "when @xmath39 is time - like , @xmath45 describes the path of the motion for a p - brane remaining parallel to a s - brane and moving transverse to it . in the subspace transverse to all of the @xmath34 directions , the configuration ( of the p - brane ) defined by @xmath46",
    "is projected into a curve which looks like the orbit of a point particle moving within a spherically symmetric potential . the adjective ` space- ( time-)like ' for the orbits then signifies that the corresponding curve in the subspace of @xmath47 is space- ( time-)like , meaning that @xmath39 itself is a space- ( time-)like coordinate . for both classes of such _ mono - dimensional _ solutions , the equations of motion of ( [ 10 ] ) can be more easily integrated using a set of conservation laws corresponding to the symmetries given by ( [ 5])-([7 ] ) .",
    "generically , for an orbit depending on @xmath39 , a conservation low as @xmath48 yields = 0 [ 11]which identifies the component @xmath49 of the current as a conserved charge along the orbit .",
    "we will see in the following sections that these conserved charges provide the sufficient information required for integrating the equations of motion for @xmath45 .",
    "then we observe that the orbits are effectively characterized by the 2-dimensional motion of a point particle in the newtonian mechanics whose different phases of motion are determined by an effective potential depending on two ( energy and angular momentum ) parameters .",
    "the analysis then proceeds via a set of ( phase ) diagrams depending only on the energy parameter , and reveals a variety of regimes ( phases of the effective motion ) for orbits with various parameters .",
    "we study the three cases with @xmath50 through separate analyses in the next three sections .",
    "in this case the @xmath51 row of ( [ 9 ] ) defines @xmath36 and the lagrangian @xmath30 , using eqs.([1])-([3 ] ) , for a general configuration is written as = -h^-1(y)[det^1/2(^_+h(y)^y^m_y^m)- ] [ 12]where @xmath52 for a brane - brane ( brane - anti - brane ) s - p configuration ( note that in this case the two branes ` see ' the form - fields of each other via a force depending on their relative orientation ; the sign of @xmath53 reflects this orientation ) .",
    "the conserved currents in this case consist of : t^ _  = y^m _  , -^ _ & , & _ t^=0 [ 13 ] + m^=x^t^-x^t^ & , & _ m^=0 [ 14 ] + j^_mn = y^m - y^n & , & _",
    "j^_mn=0 [ 15]which in correspondence to the symmetries ( [ 5])-([7 ] ) have to be identified as the energy - momentum , ` longitudinal ' and ` transverse ' angular momentum tensors respectively . since the conservation of @xmath54 naturally follows from that of @xmath55 , only the eqs.([13 ] ) and",
    "( [ 15 ] ) are taken as the informative parts of the conservation laws for this analysis .",
    "going to the mono - dimensional solutions , the lagrangian ( [ 12 ] ) becomes l =- h^-1[(1+hy^2)^1/2- ] [ 16]where @xmath56 , if @xmath39 is a space- ( time-)like coordinate and @xmath57 .",
    "the corresponding conserved charges , according to eqs.([11]),([13]),([15 ] ) , are e&=&y^ml - l =- h^-1(- 1 ) [ 17 ] + j^mn&=&y^ml- y^nl=-(y^my^n - y^ny^m ) [ 18]for a time - like orbit ( @xmath58 ) , @xmath1 and @xmath59 have obvious interpretations as the energy , which excludes the rest masses of ( s , p)-branes . ] and the ( transverse ) angular momentum tensor ( of the p - brane ) respectively . for a space - like orbit ( @xmath60 ) , however , they have to be interpreted as the flows of the respective quantities along the orbit ( @xmath39 ) direction . is a diagonal matrix , with @xmath61 and its all other diagonal components are equal to @xmath62 .",
    "so , for @xmath58 , @xmath1 is the energy while for @xmath60 it is a component of the ( anisotropic ) pressure along the @xmath39 direction . ]",
    "+ as in the ordinary 3d particle mechanics , one expects that the angular momentum conservation restricts the dimension of the orbits ( hyper)planes .",
    "such a property is in fact a result of the equation(s ) obtained from eq.([18 ] ) by eliminating the velocities ; that is j^mny^p+j^npy^m+j^pmy^n=0 [ 19]where distinguished equations are obtained for distinct values of @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",
    "so , the orbit @xmath65 lies at the common intersection of a set of @xmath66-dimensional hyperplanes defining the ` orbit plane ' .",
    "the ( maximum ) number of independent equations of the form eq.([19 ] ) thus fixes the ( maximum ) dimension of the orbit plane . for @xmath67",
    "one can show that this plane , just as in the newtonian particle mechanics , is a 2-dimensional plane , provided , one have respectively 0,1,3 non - zero components for @xmath59 and a relation of the type of eq.([20 ] ) is not required . ]",
    "j^12j^34+j^13j^42+j^14j^23=0 , etc .",
    "[ 20]further , when ( all ) @xmath68 , the orbit plane degenerates to a straight line or a single point . by rotating the @xmath9 coordinates , so that the orbit plane coincides with the @xmath69-plane , all @xmath59 s except @xmath70",
    "are transformed to zero ( obviously , such @xmath59 s obey eq.([20 ] ) ) .",
    "using the polar coordinates @xmath71 in the @xmath69-plane , the conservation laws ( [ 17]),([18 ] ) will read ( -+ 1 ) & = & e [ 21 ] + r^2&=&l [ 22]where @xmath72 is the same as @xmath73 ( eq.([2 ] ) ) with @xmath74 , and @xmath75 is the angular momentum parameter . solving these two eqs.for @xmath76 ,",

    "is generally impossible .",

    "<S> in this paper , we investigate about two physically distinct classes of the ` one - dimensional ' worldvolume solutions describing the status of an arbitrary brane in the presence of another arbitrary ( flat ) brane which supplies the required supergravity background . </S>",
    "<S> one of these classes concerns with a relative ( transverse ) motion of two parallel flat branes , while the other class is related to a static configuration in which one of the branes is flat and the other is curved as a cylindrical hypersurface . </S>",
    "<S> global symmetries of the worldvolume theory are used to show that both types of these solutions are described by some sort of ` planar orbits ' which are specified by their ` energy ' and ` angular momentum ' @xmath0 parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we find that various phases of the ` motion ' along these orbits , for different values of @xmath0 , are easily deduced from the curve of an @xmath1-dependent function of the relative ` distance ' between the two branes , which is somehow related to their mutual ` effective potential ' .    </S>",
