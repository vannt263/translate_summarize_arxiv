    "recently , a lot of investigations have been devoted to the combination of ultracold atom physics and cavity quantum electrodynamics .",
    "experimentally , the efforts culminate in the successful coupling of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , that is , a single matter - wave field mode , to a single cavity mode in a high finesse optical cavity @xcite .",
    "though of a very short history , this type of combined system has demonstrated many interesting phenomena , such as vacuum rabi splitting @xcite , @xmath0 scaling of the atom - photon coupling @xcite , optical bistability @xcite , cavity enhanced superradiance of a bec @xcite , and most surprisingly , a map between the atom ensemble - cavity system and the canonical opto - mechanical system is found @xcite . besides playing an active role in the dynamics , the cavity can also be used to characterize the properties of the matter - wave field . it has been experimentally implemented to study the statistics of an atom laser by detecting single atoms falling through a cavity @xcite . based on similar principles , a proposal to probe the superfluidity - mott insulator transition is brought up @xcite .",
    "one of the most remarkable characteristics of the atom ensemble - cavity system is its intrinsic nonlinearity .",
    "if we are only interested in the mechanical motion of the atoms and thus confine ourself to the large detuning limit , the atom - photon interaction is of a dispersive nature .",
    "the atom - photon interaction provides a potential ( an optical lattice ) to the atoms , and meanwhile shifts the cavity mode frequency . by shifting the cavity mode frequency ,",
    "the atom ensemble can influence or even determine the potential acting on itself .",
    "this entails a nonlinearity substantially different than the usual atom - atom interactions .",
    "it is this nonlinearity that lies at the heart of previous experimental and theoretical works @xcite , in particular , the dispersive optical bistability @xcite .    along this line",
    ", we consider the nonlinear dynamics of a cigar - shaped bose - einstein condensate in an optical cavity in this work .",
    "experimentally , this has been achieved and investigated by esslinger _",
    "et al_. @xcite , and in the weak atom - atom interaction and weak excitation limit ( or non - depletion limit ) , it is found that the condensate can be described as a harmonic oscillator and the condensate - cavity system maps onto the generic cavity opto - mechanical system perfectly . in this work",
    "we approach the same problem from the perspective of diffraction of matter - wave by an optical lattice .",
    "we will not restrict to the weak excitation limit .",
    "we will develop a discrete - mode approximation ( dma ) for the condensate , and by comparing with the full description of gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation , we find that the finite - mode approximation is quantitatively good in the case of weak atom - atom interaction .",
    "the dma also enables us to find out the steady states of the system , analyze their stability , and elucidate the possibility of breakdown of adiabaticity and optical bistability in this system .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system and the general formalism are described in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] . then in sec .",
    "[ sec3a ] , we compare the dma with the full gp dynamics so as to validate the dma . in sec .",
    "[ sec3b ] , we address the problem of adiabatic evolution of the system , which is relevant to optical bistability .",
    "our results are summarized in sec .",
    "we assume that a cigar - shaped bose - einstein condensate is located inside an optical cavity with its axial direction parallel to that of the cavity .",
    "the internal transition frequency of the two - level modeled atoms is @xmath1 , while the relevant cavity mode interacting with the atoms is of frequency @xmath2 .",
    "the cavity mode is coherently driven by a pump laser with frequency @xmath3 and a possibly time - dependent amplitude @xmath4 .",
    "the atom - pump and cavity - pump detunings are denoted as @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . in the large detuning limit and by transferring into the rotating frame at the pump frequency , we get the hamiltonian for the condensate - cavity system ( @xmath7 throughout in this paper ) @xcite , @xmath8 here , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the creation operators for the atoms ( with mass @xmath11 ) and the cavity photons , respectively .",
    "@xmath12 is the harmonic potential in the axial direction with characteristic frequency @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the effective atom - atom interaction strength in a transversely tight - confining trap @xcite .",
    "besides the harmonic potential @xmath15 ( which may also owe to atom - photon interaction , as in an optical trap ) , the atom - cavity photon interaction provides an additional potential @xmath16 for the atoms .",
    "the difference is that , the former is static , while the latter , being proportional to the intra cavity photon number , may be dynamical and quantized @xcite . here",
    "@xmath17 is the maximal light shift per photon an atom may experience ( at an antinode ) , with @xmath18 being the atom - photon coupling constant .",
    "note that we assume that the transverse radius of the condensate is much smaller than the cavity mode waist , and therefore it is legitimate to neglect the variation of @xmath18 in the transverse direction .",
    "the cavity mode function in the axial direction is @xmath19 , with the wave vector @xmath20 . finally , @xmath21 accounts for cavity photon decay with a rate @xmath22 .",
    "in the mean field approximation , we take @xmath23 and @xmath24 , i.e. , both the matter - wave field and the electromagnetic field are described as classical fields .",
    "the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation for the condensate is @xmath25 and the equation of motion for the cavity field is @xmath26 we can numerically integrate these coupled equations and so as to study the dynamics of the combined system . to this end , technically , we had better convert the original equations into their dimensionless form .",
    "the characteristic length scale and energy scale of the system are @xmath27 and @xmath28 , i.e. , the period of the optical lattice divided by @xmath29 and the atomic recoil energy , respectively .",
    "we thus rescale position and time as @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively , and accordingly the condensate wavefunction @xmath32 , so that the scaled wavefunction is normalized to unity , @xmath33 . here",
    "@xmath34 is the total atom number .",
    "equations ( [ condensate motion ] ) and ( [ photon motion ] ) then convert to @xmath35 @xmath36 here we introduced the rescaled dimensionless quantities @xmath37 , the rescaled harmonic frequency @xmath38 , and the atom - atom interaction strength @xmath39 .    at this point ,",
    "a further simplification is possible .",
    "note that experimentally the cavity damping is much faster than the mechanical motion of the condensate .",
    "the former occurs at a rate of @xmath22 , while the latter , roughly speaking , is on the order of @xmath40 ( see the discrete - mode approximation below ) . in the experiment of esslinger _ et al_. @xcite , @xmath41 mhz , and @xmath40 is around @xmath42 khz ( @xmath43rb ) , so the cavity decay is almost three orders of magnitude faster than than the condensate motion .",
    "we thus can safely assume that the cavity field follows the condensate adiabatically and solve the photon number as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is defined as @xmath46 , and has the meaning of the overlap between the cavity mode intensity and the condensate density distribution . obviously , it is bounded from above and below , @xmath47 .",
    "equation ( [ photon number ] ) gives the dependence of the intra cavity photon number , i.e. , the intra cavity optical lattice depth on the condensate .",
    "the cavity - pump detuning is shifted by the condensate to an effective value @xmath48 .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ photon number ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ bec motion 2 ] ) , we get a gp equation for the condensate , the most prominent feature of which is that the potential acting on the condensate depends in a highly non - local and non - linear way on the condensate itself .",
    "this is to be compared with the non - linear term in the usual gp equation , the atom - atom interaction , which is nonlinear but local .",
    "if this cavity induced nonlinearity is to exhibit itself apparently , the influence of the condensate on the cavity field should be strong .",
    "to this end , it is desirable to have @xmath49 ( with an appropriate @xmath50 ) . only under this condition , the condensate is able to shift the cavity into or out of resonance with the pump [ see eq .",
    "( [ photon number ] ) ] and so as to influence the cavity field drastically .",
    "it is worth noting that this condition has been fulfilled with both fabry - perot cavities @xcite and ring cavities @xcite .",
    "although a brutal integration of eq .",
    "( [ bec motion 2 ] ) is possible , and that captures all the possible atomic modes simultaneously , we would like to introduce the discrete - mode approximation ( dma ) .",
    "the advantage of dma is that it captures the physics and is technically simpler than the full gp equation . to explain the basic idea ,",
    "let us consider the extremal case @xmath51 and @xmath52 , i.e. , a non - interacting homogeneous condensate .",
    "the ground state of the condensate is the zero momentum state @xmath53 .",
    "the effect of the intra cavity optical lattice is to diffract this state into the state @xmath54 ( diffraction into the asymmetrical superposition state is forbidden by the parity symmetry of the potential ) , which can then be further diffracted into @xmath55 ( or back into @xmath56 ) , and so on .",
    "thus the dynamics of the system actually confines to some discrete atomic modes .",
    "this stimulates us to introduce the dma .    in the actual case ,",
    "@xmath57 and @xmath58 , the ground state @xmath59 is not strictly the zero momentum state .",
    "however , usually the length of the condensate is much larger than the period of the optical lattice , thus by the long range coherence of the condensate and the uncertainty relation , we infer that the momentum distribution of the condensate is well localized around the origin with a width much smaller than @xmath60 .",
    "thus the picture for the non - interacting homogeneous bec carries over to the actual case , as long as in the period we are concerned with , the atomic diffraction process overwhelms other effects caused by the finite trap potential and atom - atom interaction",
    ". we can take into account the small but finite momentum spread of the initial state by defining the discrete modes as @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and generally for @xmath64 , @xmath65 @xcite . in the momentum representation",
    ", @xmath66 is a coherent superposition of two peaks localized at @xmath67 respectively . for the @xmath68-th mode",
    ", we introduce the creation ( annihilation ) operator @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) , with common boson commutation relations .",
    "note that these mode functions are not strictly orthonormal , so this assignment of commutation relations is a bit problematic . however , as long as the ground state @xmath59 varies slowly on a length scale of @xmath71 , the error is negligible .",
    "the dma assumes that the condensate dynamics is confined in the subspace spanned by @xmath72 .",
    "numerically , we find that it is enough to cut off at @xmath73 .",
    "higher modes play a minor role due to the quadratically increasing eigenenergies . substituting @xmath74 into eq .",
    "( [ h1 ] ) , and neglecting the atom - atom interaction , we get the hamiltonian in the dma @xmath75 in our calculations , we have used the equations :    @xmath76    and dropped the constant term proportional to @xmath77 .",
    "these equations become exact in the non - interacting homogenous case . in the dma hamiltonian",
    ", the atom - photon interaction can be interpreted in two ways . for the atoms",
    ", they are diffracted between adjacent modes with coupling strengths proportional to the photon number ; for the photons , their frequency is renormalized proportional to the interference of the atomic modes .",
    "the atom - atom interaction we neglect contains terms like @xmath78 @xcite , which shift the energies of the excited modes , and more importantly , it mixes the discrete modes we retain and other modes we discard in a four - wave mixing way .",
    "therefore , the atom - atom interaction impairs the discrete - mode approximation . however , since the energy scale of the atom - atom interaction is on the order of the chemical potential of the condensate @xmath79 ( in units of @xmath40 , in the thomas - fermi regime ) , it may be legitimate to neglect it in a time scale of @xmath80 if @xmath81 , the free frequency of the first excited mode in units of @xmath40 . in esslinger _",
    "et al_. s experiment , @xmath82 khz , while the chemical potential of the condensate is about @xmath83 khz .    from the hamiltonian ( [ h2 ] ) , by taking the mean field approximation @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and integrating out the cavity field , we get the equation of motion for the condensate @xmath86 with @xmath87 , and @xmath88 the photon number is @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the rescaled effective cavity - pump detuning with the condensate in its ground state [ @xmath91 .",
    "we would also like to define the general effective cavity - pump detuning @xmath92 .",
    "equation ( [ pho dma ] ) is just eq .",
    "( [ photon number ] ) in the discrete - mode approximation .",
    "in this section , we apply the formalism developed in the preceding section to two different cases . the first case deals with a constant pump , which acts on the bec - cavity system abruptly , the evolution of the bec - cavity system is studied .",
    "the second case considers the scenario that the pump is turned on slowly and smoothly .",
    "we aim to study the evolution of self - sustained steady state of the bec - cavity system as the parameters varied .",
    "( color online ) evolution of the effective detuning @xmath93 . the dashed line , dashed dotted line , dotted line , and the solid line correspond to fig .  [ fig1](a)-(d ) , respectively.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    assume that initially the bec is in its ground state , and the cavity is the vacuum .",
    "then at @xmath94 a beam of laser with constant frequency and constant amplitude is projected onto the cavity . in a time scale of @xmath95 , the intra cavity field and",
    "hence the intra cavity optical lattice builds up , which then diffracts the bec into higher momentum states . in the position representation ,",
    "the condensate is deformed by the optical lattice potential .",
    "the point is that , as the condensate deforms , its overlap with the cavity mode and hence the effective cavity - pump detuning varies , which in turn leads to the variation of the lattice potential .",
    "though atom diffraction by an optical lattice has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally since two decades ago @xcite , in all previous works the optical lattice is either static or just a time - dependent parameter .",
    "in contrast , here the lattice potential has to be treated as a dynamical variable .",
    "we have simulated the dynamics of the bec - cavity system with both the gp equation and the discrete - mode approximation .",
    "the gp simulations are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1](a)-(c ) , with @xmath96 being fixed , and @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 , respectively . in each figure , we present the evolution of the photon number @xmath100 and the normalized populations @xmath101 on different atomic modes . in one dimension ,",
    "the thomas - fermi approximation is valid if @xmath102 @xcite . with this criterion",
    ", we find that the three cases are all deep in the thomas - fermi regime .",
    "thus , the atom - atom interaction plays an important role in determining the ground state of the condensate .",
    "in particular , the radius of the condensate is enlarged from @xmath103 to @xmath104 ( in units of @xmath27 ) .",
    "for all the three cases , we have @xmath105 , therefore the basic condition for dma is satisfied .",
    "the simulation based on dma is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) .",
    "note that in dma , the atom - atom interaction and the initial ground state are irrelevant .",
    "thus , fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) is a common approximation to figs .",
    "[ fig1](a)-(c ) . by comparing fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) with figs .",
    "[ fig1](a)-(c ) , we see that to a time scale as long as @xmath106 , the discrete - mode approximation agrees with the full gp equation very well .",
    "moreover , the agreement improves as the atom - atom interaction decreases .",
    "the dma recovers the @xmath107 case [ fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) ] almost exactly . by examining the difference of figs .",
    "[ fig1](a)-(c ) with fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) , we identify two consequences of the atom - atom interaction .",
    "firstly , we see in figs .",
    "[ fig1](a ) and [ fig1](b ) that as time goes on , the total populations on the discrete modes we take decreases , and the time scale of this process increases with decreasing atom - atom interaction",
    ". therefore , it is reasonable to attribute this phenomenon to the atom - atom interaction , which populates the atoms outside the modes we take .",
    "secondly , the atom - atom interaction shifts up the frequencies of the excited atomic modes , and thus shortens the oscillation period of the system @xcite .    to illustrate the second point , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the evolution of the effective detuning @xmath93 in figs .",
    "[ fig1](a)-(d ) .",
    "the oscillation of @xmath93 is directly related to that of the photon number .",
    "we see clearly that the periods in gp simulations are a bit shorter than that in dma , and the stronger the atom - atom interaction , the more apparent this effect .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] also helps us understand the double - peak structure of the photon number line in fig .",
    "each time @xmath93 crosses zero , @xmath100 attains its maximal value @xmath108 .      in this subsection , we proceed to consider the scenario that initially the bec is in its ground state and the cavity is in the vacuum , and subsequently the pump is slowly and smoothly turned on .",
    "in contrast to the situation above where the system is exposed suddenly to a finite pump and experience oscillations indefinitely , here we are concerned with the adiabatical following of the self - sustained steady states . by a self - sustained steady state ,",
    "we mean that the two sides are stationary and consistent with each other : the condensate is in the ground state determined by the optical lattice ( plus the harmonic trap ) , and meanwhile the optical lattice ( its depth ) is determined by the condensate configuration , i.e. , fulfilling ( [ photon number ] ) or ( [ pho dma ] ) .",
    "naively , it is expected that as long as the pump is ramped up sufficiently slow , the bec - cavity system will follow the steady states all the way .",
    "however , now we are dealing with a nonlinear system and the nonlinearity may give rise to the breakdown of adiabaticity @xcite .",
    "that is what we are interested in .    for our purpose ,",
    "the key issue is to map out all the possible steady states as the pump strength varies .",
    "although this is a bit difficult ( time - consuming numerically ) in the gp formalism , it can be done very conveniently with dma . in the framework of dma ,",
    "a steady state corresponds to a solution of eq .",
    "( [ eom 2 ] ) such that @xmath109 or equivalently , @xmath110 which defines a nonlinear eigenvalue problem because the hamiltonian @xmath111 depends on the eigenstate @xmath112 through @xmath100 .",
    "it is impossible to invoke the concepts and tools in linear algebra to solve this problem .",
    "our strategy is to first take an arbitrary trial photon number @xmath113 , solve the ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and then substitute it into eq .",
    "( [ pho dma ] ) to get an output photon number @xmath116 .",
    "if @xmath117 , then the solution is self - consistent and a steady state is obtained .",
    "note that @xmath116 , as a function of @xmath113 , is continuous and moreover , it is bounded both form above and below , @xmath118 . therefore ,",
    "if we scan @xmath113 from @xmath119 to @xmath108 , by the principle of continuity , there must be at least one point where @xmath117 .",
    "this guarantees the existence of steady state solutions ( clearly the same strategy and arguments apply also in the gp formalism ) .",
    "furthermore , because of the nonlinearity of the system , the possibility of more than one steady state solutions for a given set of parameters is expected . as observed and argued in refs .",
    "@xcite , the existence of more eigenvectors than the dimensional of the hilbert space is unique for nonlinear systems .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , we depict the output photon number @xmath116 as a function of the trial photon number @xmath113 as the pump strength @xmath120 varies while other parameters are held at constant . for each curve , each of its intersections with the dotted line @xmath117 corresponds to a steady state .",
    "we see that for @xmath121 and @xmath122 , there is only one steady state solution , while in an intermediate range , there can be three ( for example , @xmath123 ) . this fact is made more evident in figs .  [ fig2](b ) and [ fig2](c ) , where we plot the photon number at steady state @xmath124 and the nonlinear eigenvalue @xmath125 as a function of @xmath120 directly . in the interval @xmath126",
    ", each @xmath120 corresponds to three steady states and hence three @xmath124 s and three @xmath125 s .",
    "the folded level structure in fig .  [ fig2](c ) is similar to the looped level structure in refs .",
    "@xcite .            with these figures as maps , we return to the scenario again .",
    "as the pump is slowly ramped up from zero , the bec - cavity system follows the curve @xmath127 in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) adiabatically .",
    "things go on like this until the pump exceeds @xmath128 , where the curve terminates .",
    "interpreted in terms of fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , the system first evolves from @xmath129 to @xmath130 to @xmath131 , then at some point @xmath131 coincides with @xmath132 and then they disappear all together .",
    "similar interpretation can be made in terms of fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) .",
    "as @xmath133 crosses @xmath128 , the system can not jump discontinuously from @xmath134 to @xmath135 .",
    "therefore , beyond this critical value of pump , there is no way for the bec - cavity system to evolve adiabatically anymore , no matter how slow the external pump is varied .",
    "we thus expect large amplitude oscillations to appear abruptly as in fig .",
    "this is verified with simulations both based on the gp equation and dma , as shown in fig .",
    "there we assume that the pump is ramped up and down with a gaussian profile .",
    "both the simulations reveal clearly a two - stage feature of the history of the bec - cavity system . before a critical moment",
    "@xmath136 ( corresponding to @xmath137 ) , the photon number varies smoothly and coincides with the prediction based on dma perfectly .",
    "this indicates the system evolves adiabatically along the line @xmath127 .",
    "however , just across this point , pronounced oscillations with large amplitudes and small periods occur .",
    "note that here the breakdown of adiabaticity is related to the disappearance of a nonlinear eigenstate .",
    "this is to be compared with its counterpart in linear systems , which usually results from level - crossing .",
    "while the latter can be avoided in principle , the former can not . in the viewpoint of state preparation , to prepare the system on the line @xmath138",

    ", optical bistability has been discussed and observed , but an analysis of stability is lacking .",
    "if there are some dissipation channels , it may be possible to switch between the upper and lower stable branches and observe the typical hysteresis loop of optical bistability in the bec - cavity system .",
    "here we can only simulate the coherent behavior of the system and thus this phenomenon is beyond our means .",
    "however , the mechanism underlying optical bistability still manifests itself in the form of breakdown of adiabaticity .",
    "we have investigated the nonlinear dynamics of a bec - cavity system .",
    "this system is characterized by the nonlinearity that the optical lattice acting on the condensate depends on the condensate itself in a highly non - linear and non - local way . by borrowing ideas from atom optics ,",
    "we develop the discrete - mode approximation ( dma ) .",
    "the philosophy of dma is that the dynamics of the condensate confines to some discrete standing - wave modes .",
    "it is numerically verified that in the limit of weak atom - atom interaction , dma agrees with the full gp equation dynamics perfectly .",

    "the dma facilitates us to solve the nonlinear eigenstates of the system and analyze their stability . due to the nonlinearity of the system",

    "<S> this system is characterized by its nonlinearity : after integrating out the freedom of the cavity mode , the potential felt by the condensate depends on the condensate itself . </S>",

    "<S> we map out the steady configurations of the system . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that due to the nonlinearity of the system , the nonlinear levels of the system can fold up in some parameter regimes . </S>",
    "<S> that will lead to the breakdown of adiabaticity . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the dynamical stability of the steady states indicates that the same level structure also results in optical bistability . </S>"
