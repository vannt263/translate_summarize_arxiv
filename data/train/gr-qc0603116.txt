    "scalar - tensor theories of gravity provide a convenient framework within which to model space - time variations of the newtonian gravitational constant , @xmath0 .",
    "they feature a scalar field , @xmath1 , which is non - minimally coupled to the space - time curvature in the gravitational action .",
    "it is this scalar , or more usually its reciprocal , that drives variations in @xmath0 .",
    "non - minimally coupled scalar fields arise in a variety of different theories , including kaluza - klein theory @xcite , string theories string and brane - worlds @xcite .",
    "the same mechanism that creates a scalar field non - minimally coupled to the curvature in these theories can also lead to a coupling between the scalar and matter fields .",
    "this coupling manifests itself through the matter lagrangian becoming a function of @xmath1 .",
    "the possibility of such a coupling is usually neglected in the literature , where the matter lagrangian is _ a priori _ assumed to be independent of @xmath1 .",
    "it is the possibility of a coupling between the scalar and matter fields in scalar - tensor theories that will be the subject of this work .",
    "the introduction of a coupling between @xmath1 and matter greatly enlarges the phenomenology of the theory .",
    "potentially , this allows greater variability of @xmath0 in the early universe whilst still satisfying the solar system bounds on time - varying @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we will consider spatially - flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmologies and investigate the extent to which @xmath0 can vary when energy is exchanged between the @xmath1 field and ordinary matter .",
    "as well as giving a window into the four - dimensional cosmologies associated with higher - dimensional theories , we hope that this direction of study might also be useful in understanding why the present value of @xmath0 is so small compared to the proton mass scale ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the direct exchange of energy between @xmath1 and the matter fields offers a non - adiabatic mechanism for @xmath0 to ` decay ' towards its present value from a potentially different initial value .",
    "there have been a variety of studies which investigate the drain of energy from ordered motion by entropy generation , due to bulk viscosity @xcite or direct decay @xcite or energy exchange @xcite , but few studies of the drain of energy by non - adiabatic processes from a scalar field that defines the strength of gravity @xcite .",
    "this creates a range of new behaviours in scalar - tensor cosmologies .    in considering a coupling between @xmath1 and matter",
    "we are forced to reconsider the equivalence principle .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of perfect - fluid matter fields will no longer be covariantly conserved and the trajectories of test - particles will no longer follow exact geodesics of the metric .",
    "these violations of the experimentally well verified weak equivalence principle exclude most possible couplings between @xmath1 and matter @xcite .",
    "such violations are not necessarily fatal though .",
    "we show that whilst energy - momentum is not separately conserved by the matter fields there is still an exact concept of energy - momentum conservation when the energy density of the scalar field is included .",
    "furthermore , the non - geodesic motion of test particles is only problematic if the coupling increases above experimentally acceptable levels as the universe ages .",
    "the theory we consider is still a geometric one and it remains true that at any point on the space - time manifold it is possible to choose normal coordinates so that it looks locally flat , ensuring that it is always possible to transform to a freely - falling frame in which the effects of gravity are negligible ( up to tidal forces ) .",
    "the simplest scalar - tensor theory is the brans - dicke theory @xcite , defined by the lagrangian density @xmath3   \\label{bd}\\]]where @xmath4 is the brans - dicke coupling constant , @xmath5 is the scalar curvature of space - time , and @xmath6 is the lagrangian density of the matter fields , denoted by @xmath7 . as @xmath8",
    "this theory reduces to general relativity and @xmath9 becomes constant ( for exceptions see @xcite ) .",
    "it is an important feature of these theories that @xmath6 is independent of @xmath1 .",
    "this ensures that the matter fields do not interact with the scalar field directly and therefore that the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath10 , derived from @xmath6 is conserved ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "this conservation of @xmath10 , whilst appealing , is not absolutely necessary in deriving a theory in which @xmath0 can vary .",
    "there are numerous examples where one might expect @xmath12 .",
    "for example , when considering two fluids the energy - momentum tensor of each fluid is not separately conserved unless the fluids are completely non - interacting .",
    "it is only required that the energy - momentum being lost by one of the fluids is equal to the energy - momentum being gained by the other .    in what follows",
    "we will consider the scalar field and the matter fields as two fluids ( or more than two fluids if there is more than one matter fluid present ) and introduce a transfer of energy and momentum between them .",
    "such an interaction can be introduced by allowing @xmath6 to be a function of @xmath1 and will change the nature of the resulting frw cosmologies .",
    "the field equations are derived from ( [ bd ] ) by extremizing the corresponding action with respect to the metric .",
    "defining @xmath10 for the matter in the usual way , the field equations take their standard brans - dicke form @xcite independent of the presence of interactions between @xmath1 and matter , and the einstein tensor is given by @xmath13the scalar - field propagation equation and matter energy - momentum conservation equations are @xmath14where @xmath15 is the trace of the energy - momentum tensor and @xmath16 is an arbitrary vector function of the space - time coordinates @xmath17 that determines the rate of transfer of energy and momentum between the scalar field @xmath1 and the ordinary matter fields .",
    "the precise form of @xmath18 depends on the detailed form of the interaction between the scalar and matter fields in @xmath6 .",
    "for example , a conformal transformation of the form @xmath19 from a frame in which @xmath20 gives @xmath21this particular choice of energy transfer can be interpreted as a space - time variation of the rest masses of matter described by @xmath6 . for the moment",
    ", we consider the case of more general interactions by leaving @xmath22 as an arbitrary function .",
    "later , we will consider specific forms of @xmath16 that allow direct integration of the field equations .",
    "we specialise the metric to the spatially flat , isotropic and homogeneous frw line - element with expansion scale factor @xmath23 : @xmath24substituting this metric into the field equations ( [ field ] ) , ( field2 ) and ( [ field3 ] ) gives the generalised friedmann equations : @xmath25where we have defined a comoving volume @xmath26 and a constant @xmath27 ; the energy - momentum tensor is assumed to be a perfect barotropic fluid with density @xmath28 and pressure @xmath29 which are linked by a linear equation of state @xmath30 , and over - dots denote differentiation with respect to the comoving proper time , @xmath31 .",
    "it is this set of differential equations that we need to solve in order to determine the evolution of @xmath23 and @xmath32 in cosmological models of this type .",
    "the conservation of energy and momentum as well as the second law of thermodynamics are of basic importance to physics . in considering an interaction between a gravitational scalar field @xmath33 and the matter fields @xmath34 it is , therefore , necessary to investigate the extent to which we can consider energy and momentum to be conserved and the second law to be obeyed .    when we consider the thermodynamics of an exchange of energy between the scalar field and matter it is useful to define an effective energy density , @xmath35 , for the scalar field @xmath1 .",
    "defining @xmath36the scalar - field propagation equation ( [ 2 ] ) can then be rewritten as @xmath37comparison of this equation with ( [ 4 ] ) shows that @xmath1 acts as a fluid with equation of state @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the two terms on the right hand side of this equation act as sources for the energy density @xmath40 .",
    "the first is the standard brans - dicke source term for the scalar field and the second , @xmath41 , is new and describes the energy exchange between @xmath1 and the matter fields .",
    "it can be seen that the second term is exactly the opposite of the source term in equation ( [ 1 ] ) , and it is in this sense that the total energy is conserved in this theory .",
    "it is also useful to consider the entropy .",
    "contracting the divergence of the energy - momentum tensor with the comoving four - velocity @xmath42 we obtain @xmath43where , in the last line , we have used the normalisation @xmath44 and @xmath45 . defining the particle current  by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the number density in a comoving lorentz frame ,",
    "this expression can be rewritten as @xmath48 -\\frac{(\\rho + p)}{n}{n^{a}}_{;a } \\\\ & = -nu^{a}\\left [ p\\left ( \\frac{1}{n}\\right ) { } _ { ; a}+\\left ( \\frac{\\rho } { n}% \\right ) { } _ { ; a}\\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\]]where we have used the conservation of particle number , @xmath49 .",
    "recalling the first law of thermodynamics , @xmath50where @xmath51 is the temperature and @xmath52 is the entropy , we now get @xmath53or , making use of our assumption of spatial homogeneity , @xmath54this tells us that as energy is transferred from @xmath1 to the matter fields the entropy of the matter fields increases , as expected .",
    "conversely , the matter fields can decrease their entropy by transferring energy into @xmath55 .",
    "unfortunately , there is currently no known way of defining the entropy of a non - static gravitational field so it is not possible to perform an explicit calculation of the entropy changes in @xmath33 and @xmath56 .",
    "we can only assume that if the universe can be treated as a closed system , and the exchange of energy is an equilibrium process , then the entropy that is lost or gained by the matter through this exchange will be gained or lost by the gravitational fields .",
    "this direct interaction of the matter with @xmath33 then allows an additional mechanism for increasing or decreasing the entropy of the matter content of the universe .",
    "it is convenient to define a new time coordinate @xmath57 by    @xmath58    and to re - parametrise the arbitrary function @xmath59 by @xmath60where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath57 and @xmath61 is a new arbitrary function .",
    "this re - parameterisation of the interaction is chosen to enable a direct integration of the field equations and does not imply any loss of generality , as @xmath62 is an arbitrary function .",
    "the field equations ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) can now be integrated to @xmath63where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are constants of integration .",
    "we have a freedom in where we define the origin of @xmath57 and can , therefore , absorb the constant @xmath64 into @xmath57 and the definition of @xmath65 by the transformations @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "it can now be seen from ( [ phi ] ) that @xmath68 is sourced by three terms .",
    "the first corresponds to the source term in ( [ field3 ] ) and can be seen to disappear for @xmath69 , as expected for black - body radiation .",
    "the second term is constant and is the contribution of the free scalar to the evolution of @xmath1 ; it is this term which distinguishes the general spatially - flat brans - dicke frw solutions @xcite from the power - law late - time attractor solutions @xcite .",
    "the third term is new and gives the effect of the energy transfer on the evolution of @xmath1 .",
    "this term is dependent on the arbitrary function @xmath70 , which specifies the interaction between @xmath1 and the matter fields .",
    "the problem is now reduced to solving the coupled set of first - order ordinary differential equations ( [ v ] ) and ( [ phi ] ) with the constraint equation ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "the remaining equation ( [ 1 ] ) is rewritten in terms of @xmath57 and @xmath70 as @xmath71and can be solved for @xmath72 once @xmath73 and @xmath1 have been found for some @xmath74 .",
    "we can decouple the set of equations ( [ v ] ) and ( [ phi ] ) by differentiating ( [ phi ] ) and substituting for ( [ v ] ) to get the second - order ordinary differential equation @xmath75 \\left ( \\frac{% \\phi ^{\\prime } } { \\phi } \\right ) ^{2}\\end{aligned}\\]]which can be integrated to @xmath76where @xmath77and @xmath78 is a constant of integration .",
    "the three source terms for @xmath79 appear in the numerator on the right - hand side of equation ( phi2 ) .",
    "the equations ( [ v ] ) and ( [ phi ] ) can now be combined to give @xmath80 in terms of @xmath81 as @xmath82where @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath78 are defined as before .",
    "the constant @xmath78 can be set using the constraint equation ( [ 4 ] ) . using ( [ v ] ) and ( [ v2 ] ) we obtain the expression @xmath86this",
    "can then be substituted into ( [ 4 ] ) which , in terms of @xmath57 and @xmath87 , gives the generalised friedmann equation : @xmath88substituting ( [ phi2 ] ) and ( [ v2 ] ) into this we find that @xmath89",
    "if @xmath70 is specified in terms of @xmath57 we now have a set of two decoupled first - order ordinary differential equations for the two variables @xmath90 and @xmath1 .",
    "it is the solution of these equations , for specific choices of @xmath91 , that we give in this section .",
    "a simple form for @xmath70 that allows direct integration of equations ( [ phi2 ] ) and ( [ v2 ] ) is the linear function @xmath93 . from equations ( [ v ] ) and ( [ phi ] )",
    "it can be seen that the constant @xmath94 can be absorbed into @xmath64 and @xmath95 by simple redefinitions .",

    "we will now summarise the behaviour of the solutions found in the previous section , highlighting the physically significant results and constraints that can be placed on the theory by observations .    for the case of @xmath70 linear in @xmath57 it was shown that the late - time attractors of the general solutions are no longer the power - law solutions of the brans - dicke theory , but are given by equations ( [ power1 ] ) and ( power2 ) .",

    "the different value of @xmath0 during nucleosynthesis causes the weak interactions to freeze out at a different time and hence the proton to neutron ratio at this time is different to the standard case .",
    "this modification causes different abundances of the light elements to be produced , which can be compared with observations to constrain the underlying theory .",
    "studies of this kind usually assume @xmath0 to be constant during nucleosynthesis , which will not be the case when energy is allowed to be exchanged between @xmath33 and the matter fields .",
    "the effects of a non - constant @xmath0 were studied in @xcite .",
    "a similar study would be required to place constraints upon the parameters @xmath175 and @xmath176 in this theory .",
    "the cosmic microwave background power spectrum has also often been used to constrain scalar - tensor theories of gravity @xcite . in these studies",
    "the redshift of matter - radiation equality is different from its usual general relativistic value due to the modified late - time evolution of the universe .",
    "this change in the redshift of equality is imprinted on the spectrum of perturbations as it is only after equality that sub - horizon scale perturbations are allowed to grow .",
    "the main effect is seen as a shift in the first peak of the power - spectrum , which can be compared with observations to constrain the theory .",
    "again , the late time evolution of the universe is modified from the usual brans - dicke case by the energy exchange that we consider , so that the previous constraints are not directly applicable .    for the case of a non - linear power - law exchange of energy , described by @xmath177 , the late - time evolution of @xmath154 and @xmath1 can be significantly modified .",
    "for @xmath178 the solutions do not continue to expand eternally , but are attracted towards a static state where the time - evolutions of @xmath154 , @xmath1 and @xmath28 cease . for @xmath163 the generic late - time attractor is the power - law solution of a flat frw brans - dicke universe .",
    "it appears that theories of energy exchange with @xmath140 are ruled out immediately by observations of an expanding universe whilst the case of @xmath179 is subject to the same late - time constraints as the standard brans - dicke theory @xcite .",
    "it remains to investigate the physical consequences of the early - time behaviour of our solutions . for @xmath70 linear in @xmath57",
    "these solutions approach those of the standard brans - dicke theory as either the initial singularity or the minimum of the bounce are approached , according to the sign of @xmath180 .",
    "the physical significance of this behaviour has been discussed many times before , usually focusing on the avoidance of the initial singularity and the inflation that can result from the presence of the free component of the scalar field .",
    "for @xmath181 the early - time behaviour can be significantly changed from that of the standard theory .",
    "for @xmath140 the scale factor @xmath154 either approaches infinity or zero , depending on our choice of @xmath4 and @xmath122 , as previously described . for the more realistic case of @xmath163 the evolution of @xmath154 at early times either undergoes a period of rapid expansion or a non - singular bounce , depending on whether @xmath182 is greater or less than @xmath145 .",
    "this behaviour is similar to that of the general solutions of the standard theory , but in this case the free scalar - field - dominated epoch has not been invoked and there is more freedom as to the exact form of the evolution . for example , with a suitable choice of parameters it is possible to create a universe that contracts and then is briefly static before ` bouncing ' and continuing on to its late - time power - law evolution .",
    "this is shown in figure [ bounce ] for the case @xmath183 , @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "( it is interesting to note that peter and pinto - neto remark that a static period followed by a bounce could potentially produce a scale - invariant spectrum of perturbations @xcite ) .    for the physically reasonable models with @xmath186 the evolution of @xmath55 , and hence of @xmath0 ,",
    "can be significantly altered at early times from what is generally assumed to be the case in scalar - tensor theories of gravity . for the case",
    "@xmath136 the value of @xmath0 can be made to diverge to infinity or to zero as the initial singularity is approached , independent of whether or not there was an early scalar - dominated phase to the universe s history .",
    "for the case @xmath187 the value of @xmath0 evolves smoothly through the bounce in the scale - factor , and is again independent of whether or not there was a scalar dominated phase .",
    "more complicated evolutions of @xmath1 can also be constructed , as can be seen in figure [ bounce ] .",
    "we have considered spatially - flat frw universes in scalar - tensor theories of gravity where energy is allowed to be exchanged between the brans - dicke scalar field that determines the strength of gravity and any perfect - fluid matter fields in the space - time .",
    "we have presented a prescription for integrating the field equations exactly for some unknown function @xmath70 which describes the rate at which energy is exchanged . for the case of @xmath74 being a linear function of @xmath57 we have found the general solutions to the problem and for the case of @xmath70 being a non - linear power law function of @xmath57 we have been able to find a wide class of exact solutions .",
    "these solutions display behaviours that can deviate substantially from the corresponding solutions in the standard case , where the exchange of energy is absent .",
    "depending upon the values of the parameters defining the theory and the exchange of energy , deviations in the evolution of @xmath154 and @xmath1 can occur at both early and late times , providing a richer phenomenology than is available in the standard theory .",
    "we have found that the parameter @xmath47 must be bounded by the inequality @xmath188 if the universe is to be expanding at late times . for @xmath189 we have found late - time power - law attractor solutions which can be used to constrain the parameters @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "for @xmath190 we have seen that the late - time evolution will be that same as in the standard brans - dicke case , and so is subject to the same observational constraints as these theories .",
    "the parameters @xmath191 and @xmath192 have been shown to be influential only in the vicinity of the initial singularity , or at the minimum of expansion in non - singular solutions .",
    "these parameters are therefore less accessible to constraint by late - time observations ( see , however , @xcite where the influence on primordial nucleosynthesis is used to constrain @xmath192 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath176 is , as always , subject to the very tight solar system constraint @xmath193 to @xmath194 @xcite .",
    "these results could be of interest in attempting to explain why @xmath0 is so small in the present day universe compared to the proton mass scale ( @xmath195 ) . in these models",
    "the value of @xmath0 can decay away by a coupling between the scalar field @xmath33 and the matter fields which allows energy to be transferred .",
    "the small value of @xmath0 is then due to the age of the universe .",
    "it remains to see whether or not the late - time modifications found above are consistent with observations of the primordial abundance of light elements , microwave background formation and other late - time physical processes .",
    "whilst being beyond the scope of this article , these studies should be able to be performed in an analogous way to the ones that already exist for the standard brans - dicke theory .    using the late time solutions that have been found it is possible to comment on the case of frw cosmologies with non - zero spatial curvature . at early times",
    "it is expected that the effect of any spatial curvature on the evolution of @xmath23 should be negligible . from the solution ( [ powera ] )",
    "we can see that spatial curvature will dominate the late time evolution if the condition @xmath196is satisfied .",
    "if this condition is not satisfied then the power - law solution ( [ powera ] ) will be an attractor as @xmath197 even in the case of non - zero spatial curvature , offering a potential solution to the flatness problem .",
    "this behaviour corresponds to power - law inflation and it can be seen that the condition for equation ( [ powera ] ) to dominate over the spatial curvature at late times is , indeed , also the condition that power - law inflation should occur .    in conclusion , we have found that a direct coupling between @xmath1 and the matter fields in scalar - tensor cosmologies provides a richer frame - work within which one can consider variations of @xmath0 .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to construct models where the late - time violations of the equivalence principle can be made arbitrarily small ( for @xmath198 ) or are attracted to zero ( for @xmath181 where @xmath163 ) .",
    "this enlarged phenomenology is of interest for the consideration of the four - dimensional cosmologies associated with higher - dimensional theories as well as for more general considerations of the variation of @xmath0 and its late - time value .",
    "this study has been limited to scalar - tensor theories with constant coupling parameters , to flat frw cosmologies , and to special cases of @xmath59 that allow direct integration of the field equations .",
    "obvious extensions exist in which these assumptions are partially or completely relaxed ."
