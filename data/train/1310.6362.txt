    "ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ; @xcite ) have total infrared luminosities @xmath2710@xmath28l@xmath20 and implied star formation rates ( sfr ) @xmath31001000m@xmath20yr@xmath11 .",
    "their low space densities mean that ulirgs contribute @xmath291% of the volume average star formation density at @xmath1=0 . however , the first deep , single - dish bolometer surveys in the 870-@xmath0 m atmospheric window uncovered high number densities of high - redshift sub - mm galaxies ( smgs ) at mjy flux density levels @xcite .",
    "subsequent spectroscopic studies of the radio-/mid - infrared detected subset of the population gave a median redshift of @xmath302.5 @xcite , confirming their ulirg - like luminosities @xcite and demonstrated that ulirgs undergo a 1000-fold increase in space density from @xmath1=0 to @xmath302.5 .",
    "thus , in contrast to the local universe , ulirgs are a non - negligible component of the star - forming population at @xmath3023 ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",

    "these 870-@xmath0m - selected samples remain the best - studied smgs , and links have been proposed between smgs , qsos and the formation phase of massive galaxies at high redshift ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "smgs are therefore a potentially important element in models of galaxy formation .",
    "however , these evolutionary links are still unproven , although it is clear that most luminous smgs lie above the purported `` main sequence '' of star - forming galaxies in the star formation rate ",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "along with corroborating kinematic and morphological evidence @xcite , inevitably it has been argued that smgs can be understood as `` scaled - up '' analogs of local ulirgs which are dominated by merger induced starbursts .",
    "it has also been proposed that lower luminosity smgs overlap with the `` main sequence '' , leading to claims of an apparent dichotomy within this population : i.e.  between a true `` starburst '' population and slightly less active galaxies , potentially driven by secular processes @xcite .",
    "theoretical attempts to reproduce basic properties of smgs , such as 870-@xmath0 m number counts , have also led to an equally wide variety of conclusions about the nature and diversity of this population .",
    "for example , early models from @xcite and @xcite include two recipes for star formation ; `` burst '' and `` quiescent '' , with smgs corresponding to the most extreme starburst systems . one key strength of these models is that they are also required to fit the galaxy population at @xmath1=0 , which forces the former to adopt a burst initial mass function ( imf ) biased to high - mass stars ( allowing relatively low - mass galaxies to produce intense starbursts ; @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , numerical models of @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) suggest that smgs are dominated by secular bursts in gas - rich disk galaxies , with `` standard '' imfs .",
    "hence theoretical models variously predict the smg population to comprise low - mass merging starbursts ( with unusually low mass - to - light ratios ; e.g.  @xcite ) and isolated , gas - rich disk galaxies undergoing secular bursts ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this rich array of theoretical options demonstrates the power of smgs to distinguish between the competing galaxy evolution theories .",
    "observations of the most basic properties of smgs , such as their redshift distribution , bolometric luminosities , cold molecular gas dynamics and gas mass , and contribution to the cosmic star formation density should have the power to distinguish between the theoretical models .",
    "however , the coarse resolution of single dish sub - mm telescopes ( typically @xmath321520@xmath33 ) means that identifying the smg counterparts has to date , relied on correlations between their sub - millimetre emission and that in other wave - bands where higher spatial resolution is available ( usually the radio and/or mid - infrared ; e.g.  @xcite ) . the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) in these other wave - bands have positive k - corrections , making counterparts which either lie at higher redshift or that have colder - than - average dust temperatures impossible to identify .",
    "indeed , in sub - millimetre surveys typically 4050% of sub - mm sources lack `` robust '' counterparts in the radio or mid - infrared ( e.g.  @xcite , see also @xcite ) and it is unknown whether the unidentified smgs have the same redshift distribution ( or are representative ) of the radio - identified subset , potentially biasing the current observational results .    to circumvent the problem of missing- ( and mis- ) identifications and so characterize the _ whole _ population of bright smgs in an unbiased manner requires precisely locating the sub - mm emission using sub / mm interferometers ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , we have undertaken an alma survey of the 126 sub - mm sources in the 0.5@xmath70.5 degree extended _ chandra _ deep field south ( ecdfs ) , taken from the `` less '' survey @xcite .",
    "the alma data precisely locate the smgs , _ directly _ pin - pointing the source(s ) responsible for the sub - mm emission ( to within @xmath340.3@xmath33 ) , without recourse to statistical radio / mid - ir associations and so yielding unambiguous identifications for the majority of the smgs .",
    "the first results from our survey include the source catalog and multiplicity of bright smgs @xcite ; the first high - resolution sub - mm counts @xcite ; optical and near - infrared properties , photometric redshift distribution and stellar masses ( simpson et al .",
    "2013 ) ; serendipitous identification [ cii ] at @xmath1=4.4 in two smgs @xcite and subsequent @xmath8co follow - up in these galaxies @xcite ; x - ray properties and agn fraction of alma smgs @xcite ; far - infrared  radio correlation of smgs ( thomson et al .",

    "in particular , we use the far - infrared ( 70870@xmath0 m ) and 1.4ghz radio photometry together with new optical / mid - infrared - derived photometric redshifts from simpson et al .",
