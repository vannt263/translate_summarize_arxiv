    "the theory of stellar differential rotation is mainly focused on the sun where helioseismology provides all the possibilities for a detailed testing of computations .",
    "applications to other stars are , however , tempting in view of the rapid development of asteroseismology @xcite that can eventually provide data on internal stellar rotation @xcite . a knowledge of differential rotation is also considered as a key for stellar dynamos .    until recently , precise measurements of differential rotation were mainly provided by doppler imaging @xcite .",
    "this technique is most suitable for rapidly rotating stars @xcite .",
    "young dwarfs with rotation periods @xmath2 day present , however , difficulties for theory .",
    "rapid rotators have thin boundary layers at the top and bottom of their convection zones @xcite , which are difficult to resolve numerically .",
    "almost no computations of differential rotation for rapid rotators were attempted .",
    "the situation has changed recently .",
    "first , measurements of the differential rotation of two not too rapidly rotating , @xmath3 days , main - sequence dwarfs were performed using high - precision photometry of the asteroseismological _ most _ mission @xcite .",
    "second , a new mean - field code was developed that can resolve boundary layers in rapidly rotating stars ; this code is used for the first time to produce the results of this paper .",
    "we first apply it to the sun to check its ability to reproduce helioseismological inversions .",
    "then , the differential rotation of the _ most_-stars ( @xmath4  eri and @xmath5  ceti ) are computed and compared with observations .",
    "we also compute the differential rotation of ab dor and lq hya which probably have been the most frequent observational targets for doppler imaging among dwarf stars @xcite .",
    "we further compute the dependence of differential rotation on the surface temperature for rapidly rotating stars . on an observational basis ,",
    "the dependence has been studied by @xcite .",
    "the theoretical and observational results are quite similar .",
    "they both show a rapid increase of surface differential rotation with temperature .",
    "@xcite found that the rotation of f - stars can be strongly non - uniform .",
    "recently @xcite observed a large differential rotation with a pole - equator lap time slightly above 10 days on a rapidly rotating g0 dwarf .",
    "our computations suggest that shallow convection zones of f - stars can possess even stronger differential rotation .",
    "this raises the question of whether the strong rotational shear implies over - normal dynamo activity .",
    "our computations suggest a negative answer .",
    "the efficiency of differential rotation in generating magnetic fields can be estimated by the modified magnetic reynolds number that in dynamo theory is conventionally notated as @xmath1 , @xmath6 @xcite , where @xmath7 is the angular velocity variation within the convection zone , @xmath8 is the convection zone thickness and @xmath9 is the turbulent magnetic diffusivity .",
    "the @xmath1 parameter ( [ 1 ] ) is the ratio of the rate @xmath7 of magnetic field production by differential rotation to the rate @xmath10 of diffusive escape of the field from the convection zone .",
    "our computations show that @xmath1 _ decreases _ with stellar mass .",
    "contrary to intuitive expectations , a small differential rotation of m - stars is more efficient in producing magnetic fields than the large rotational shear of f - stars .",
    "differential rotation models compute the total velocity field including the meridional flow .",
    "we discuss also the meridional flow structure and its variations with the rotation rate .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes our model that is based on the mean - field hydrodynamics ( the mathematical formulation is partly shifted to the appendix ) .",
    "section 3 presents and discusses the results and section 4 summarizes the main findings .",
    "the model is based on mean - field hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "it computes jointly the differential rotation , meridional flow , and heat transport in the convection zone of a star .",
    "the differential rotation of the model results from the angular momentum transport by convection ( the @xmath11-effect ) and meridional flow .",
    "the model is close to its former version @xcite and will be described here only briefly .    in order to compute differential rotation",
    ", the model needs a knowledge of the structure of a ( non - rotating ) star to specify the basic input parameters such as stellar radius , @xmath12 , luminosity , @xmath13 , and mass , @xmath14 .",
    "the structure model also supplies the density , @xmath15 , and temperature , @xmath16 , at some small depth inside the star , which depth defines the external spherical boundary ( of radius @xmath17 ) of the simulation domain .",
    "displacing the external boundary by @xmath18 per cent in stellar radius below the photosphere helps to avoid problems with very sharp near - surface stratification .",
    "the reference stratification of the model is adiabatic and spherically symmetric , and deviations from the reference atmosphere are computed in the model .",
    "the deviations are assumed small , so that the convection zone stratification should be only slightly supearadiabatic and the rotation of the star should not be too rapid , @xmath19 . using the values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 as boundary conditions ,",
    "the equations for adiabatic profiles are integrated numerically inwards up to the point where the radiative heat flux , @xmath20 corresponds to the total luminosity , @xmath21 .",
    "this point is the base of the convection zone .",
    "the inner boundary ( @xmath22 ) is placed very slightly ( normally by 0.1 per cent of the radius ) above the base .",
    "opacity @xmath23 in ( [ 2 ] ) is computed using the _ opal _ opacity tables .",
    "therefore , the input parameters have to include the mass fraction of hydrogen , @xmath24 , and metallicity , @xmath25 .",
    "so defined , the reference atmosphere helps to specify the depth profile of the convective turnover time , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the specific heat at constant pressure , @xmath28 is gravity , @xmath29 is the mixing length , and @xmath30 is the residual heat flux that convection has to transport . the turnover time ( [ 3 ] ) enters into the key parameter of the coriolis number , @xmath31 the differential rotation results from the interaction between convection and rotation @xcite . the coriolis number ( [ 4 ] ) measures the intensity of the interaction .",
    "the value of @xmath32 defines whether convective eddies live long enough for the coriolis force to affect them considerably .",
    "the angular momentum and heat transport in the convection zone depend on the coriolis number .",
    "in particular , the eddy conductivity tensor , @xmath33 that controls the convective heat flux , @xmath34 includes the rotationally induced anisotropy and quenching via the functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 ; explicit expressions for the quenching functions are given in kitchatinov , pipin & rdiger ( 1994 ) . in ( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) , @xmath37 is the specific entropy and @xmath38 is the unit vector along the rotation axis .",
    "anisotropy of the eddy conductivity ( [ 5 ] ) means that the eddy heat flux is inclined to the radial direction even if the entropy varies mainly in radius . as a result ,",
    "the polar regions are warmer than the equator .",
    "this differential temperature is very important for differential rotation models @xcite .",
    "it results in deviations of the isorotational surfaces from a cylindrical shape .",
    "the differential temperature on the sun has been recently observed by @xcite .",
    "we want to note that the eddy conductivity @xmath39 is not prescribed , but expressed in terms of the entropy gradient , @xmath40 and the same for eddy viscosity .",
    "this involves an additional nonlinearity in the equations but avoids arbitrary prescriptions of the diffusivity profiles .",
    "the only free parameter of our model are @xmath41 of ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "the former version of the model did not use even this parameter , instead assuming that @xmath42 @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we put @xmath43 for closer agreement with helioseismology .",
    "the model solves the steady equation for the mean velocity , @xmath44 , @xmath45 together with the entropy equation , @xmath46 in ( [ 8 ] ) , @xmath47 is the correlation tensor of the fluctuating velocities @xmath48 , @xmath49 the correlation tensor can be split into a non - diffusive part , @xmath50 , representing the @xmath11-effect of non - viscous transport of angular momentum by rotating turbulence @xcite , and the contribution @xmath51 of eddy viscosities , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the eddy viscosity tensor .",
    "the mean flow is assumed to be axisymmetric about the rotation axis , @xmath54 where @xmath55 are the usual spherical coordinates , @xmath56 is the unit vector in the azimuthal direction , and @xmath57 is the stream function of the meridional flow . a complete representation for the @xmath11-effect , eddy viscosities , and two components of the motion equation ( [ 8 ] ) that provide the equations for angular velocity and meridional flow , is given in the appendix .",
    "the thermal condition on the top boundary assumes black - body radiation of the photosphere .",
    "application of the condition on the external boundary is not straightforward , however , because of the thin near - surface layer excluded from the simulation domain .",
    "we assume this layer to be a perfect heat exchanger ( infinite @xmath39 ) so that the entropy disturbances at its base and surface are equal .",
    "assuming further that the disturbances are produced at constant pressure , we find the boundary condition @xmath58 @xmath59 is radial component of the total ( convective plus radiative ) heat flux . the thermal condition at the inner boundary includes the gravitational darkening effect @xcite , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the mean angular velocity and @xmath62 is the gravity at the inner boundary .",
    "at both boundaries , stress - free and impenetrable conditions are applied , @xmath63 the stress - free condition is a source of certain difficulties .",
    "the conditions are incompatible with the taylor  proudman balance of the bulk of the convection zone ( the thermal wind balance , in the geophysical literature ) . as a result",
    ", thin layers where the balance is violated are formed near the boundaries @xcite .",
    "the boundary layers were found in both 3d @xcite and mean - field simulations @xcite of differential rotation .",
    "the layer thickness is estimated by the eckman depth , @xmath64 . in the case of rapidly rotating stars",
    ", the layers can be very thin and difficult to resolve numerically ( the thickness @xmath65 decreases with angular velocity faster than @xmath66 due to the rotational quenching of the eddy viscosity ) .    to resolve the boundary layers",
    ", we apply a non - uniform grid in radius ( zeros of chebyshev polynomials ) with small spacing near the boundaries @xmath67 @xmath68 is the total number of grid points . for the latitude dependencies ,",
    "legendre polynomial expansions were applied .",
    "this leads to the two point boundary value problem in the radius for a system of ordinary differential equations .",
    "the problem was solved numerically by the standard relaxation method @xcite .",
    "fig .  [ f1 ] shows the internal solar rotation computed with our model .",
    "the figure includes the tachocline region and the deeper radiation zone just for completeness of the picture .",
    "the tachocline was computed with a separate model @xcite that uses the results of the computation of the differential rotation of the convection zone as a boundary condition but does not influence that computation in any way .",
    "the results of fig .",
    "[ f1 ] are similar to the helioseismological rotation law @xcite .",
    "the computed meridional flow is shown in fig .",
    "the direction and amplitude of the surface flow are close to observations ( komm , howard & harvey 1993 ) .",
    "note that the flow at the bottom is not small compared to the surface .",
    "this is a quite general result also found in computations for other stars .",
    "the stagnation point in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] is close to the bottom so that the downward increase of density does not lead to a slow deep circulation . below the convection zone ,",
    "the meridional flow rapidly decreases with depth .",
    "the distance of the flow penetration into the tachocline is small compared to the tachocline thickness @xcite .",
    "the meridional flow is closely related to the taylor  proudman balance .",
    "this can be seen from the meridional flow equation @xmath69 @xcite . in this equation",
    ", the left side describes the viscous drag due to the meridional flow ( its relation to the eddy viscosity tensor is given by ( [ a7 ] ) and ( [ 11 ] ) ) , @xmath70 is the spatial derivative along the rotation axis .",
    "the two terms in the right side of ( [ mfeq ] ) represent the meridional flow driving by nonconservative parts of centrifugal and buoyancy forces , i.e. , the centrifugal and baroclinic drivings of meridional flow , respectively .",
    "the characteristic value of each of these two terms is large compared to the left side .",
    "accordingly , the two terms nearly balance each other in the bulk of convection zone . consequences of the taylor  proudman balance for the solar rotation law have been analyzed by @xcite .",
    "deviations of isorotational surfaces from a cylindrical shape are possible due to the latitudinal inhomogeneity of entropy , which in turn can result from the anisotropy of the convective heat transport .",
    "the taylor  proudman balance is currently rediscussed in the context of a new hypothesis on the coincidence of the isorotational and isentropic surfaces in rotating stars @xcite .    fig .",
    "[ sunbalance ] shows the contributions of the centrifugal and baroclinic terms in ( [ mfeq ] ) , and their sum for the present model of the solar rotation .",
    "the bulk of the convection zone is very close to taylor  proudman balance .",
    "there are , however , boundary layers where the balance is violated and the layers are not very thin ( cf .",
    "balbus et al .  2009 ) .",
    "similar results on the taylor  proudman balance are provided by 3d numerical simulations ( miesch et al .",
    "2006 ; brun , antia , and chitre 2010 ) .    in ( [ mfeq ] ) , we see that deviations from balance produce a meridional flow",
    ". observations of the global meridional flow on the sun @xcite indicate that certain deviations from taylor  proudman balance are present .",
    "the main problem with applying the differential rotation model to individual stars is to specify the ( input ) stellar parameters .",

    ". the profile can be only roughly approximated by the @xmath79-law of ( [ 18 ] ) .",
    "if the approximation is nevertheless used to describe the rotation of the stellar spots , it may lead to a seeming variation of the differential rotation with time .",
    "the spots positioned at different latitudes for different observational epochs would lead to different @xmath80 suggesting torsional oscillations even for a steady rotation law .",
    "observational estimates of the differential rotation of the slower rotating lq hya have a wide spread @xcite .",
    "we can only state that the differential rotation measure of our model , @xmath81 , is within the range of observational estimates .",
    "the meridional flow of fig .",
    "[ f6 ] shows an extreme concentration in the boundary layers .",
    "the flow consists of two near - boundary jets linked by a very slow circulation in the bulk of the convection zone .",
    "such a boundary - layer flow is , probably , not important for dynamos .",
    "however , the distributed ( solar - type ) flow of fig .",
    "[ f2 ] may be significant for magnetic field transport .",
    "the meridional circulation changes from a distributed flow ( fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) to the near - boundary jets ( fig .",
    "[ f6 ] ) with an increasing rotation rate .",
    "this change of meridional flow may cause a change in the dynamo regime that may be the reason for the two separate branches for fast and slow rotators in the dependence of the dynamo - cycle period on the stellar rotation rate found by @xcite .",
    "[ f7 ] shows the dependence of the surface differential rotation on stellar mass computed with our model .",
    "the computations were made for young stars just arrived on the main sequence and rotating with a period of 1  day .",
    "models were produced for the mass range from @xmath82 to @xmath83 ( with @xmath84 spacing ) .",
    "these computations cover the surface temperature range from about 3600  k to 6500  k or spectral types from k2 to f6 which roughly corresponds to the range for which @xcite constructed the temperature dependence of the surface differential rotation detected by doppler imaging .",
    "the computations were made for three metallicity values of @xmath85 . for a given stellar mass ,",
    "the results depend on the chemical composition , so that for a mass of @xmath83 , the surface differential rotation differs by a factor of about 10 between the cases of @xmath73 and @xmath86 .",
    "the metallicity dependence almost disappear , however , when the differential rotation is plotted as a function of surface temperature ( fig .",
    "so , the effective temperature is indeed convenient for parameterizing the differential rotation of young stars @xcite .",
    "an even better scaling can be found by using the coriolis number of ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "the results for different chemical compositions practically coincide on the plot of differential rotation as a function of the coriolis number . as",
    "the coriolis number is not directly observable , we shall keep using the surface temperature .",
    "[ f7 ] and [ f8 ] predict that relatively hot convective stars can possess strong differential rotations with pole - equator lap times shorter than 10 days .",
    "this is larger than the strongest differential rotation observed to date @xcite .",
    "the question arises whether a strong differential rotation implies over - normal dynamo - activity .",
    "the results of fig .",
    "[ f9 ] suggest a negative answer .",
    "the figure shows the @xmath1 dynamo - number of ( [ 1 ] ) as a function of surface temperature .",
    "the @xmath1-parameter was computed for the middle of the convection zone using the isotropic part of the eddy magnetic diffusivity @xmath87 ( that coincides with the eddy conductivity ; @xcite ) and latitudinal differential rotation ( the radial inhomogeneity of rotation is relatively small ) .",
    "the estimation assumes that dynamos of young stars are distributed over their convection zones @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 of fig .",
    "[ f9 ] declines sharply with temperature for f - stars indicating that the strong differential rotation of these stars is not efficient at producing toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "this is in agreement with the idea of @xcite that convective dynamos cease to operate at about spectral type f6 .",
    "the @xmath1 increases steadily with decreasing temperature .",
    "this is because the convection slows down in low mass stars to decrease eddy diffusion .",
    "the decline of magnetic eddy diffusivity overpowers the decrease of differential rotation to produce a larger @xmath1 in smaller stars .",
    "the largest @xmath1 belong to m - dwarfs .",
    "this is in contrast to the common belief that the small differential rotation of m - stars can not be important for dynamos and that the magnetic fields of these stars are generated by the @xmath88-mechanism .",
    "the @xmath88 dynamos produce nonaxisymmetric global fields .",
    "however , observations favour an axial symmetry of the global magnetic structure of m - stars @xcite . this may be explained by the effect of differential rotation , which is small in low - mass stars , but efficient in winding magnetic fields .",
    "the gravitational darkening of ( [ 14 ] ) is not significant for our results .",
    "neglecting the darkening effect reduces the computed differential rotation normally by less than 1 per cent ( by several per cent in extreme cases of rapidly rotating f - stars ) .",
    "this paper presents the first results of the new mean - field model of stellar differential rotation , which improves on its former formulation @xcite , to cover the case of rapidly rotating stars with @xmath2  day .",
    "the model reproduces very closely helioseismological inversions for the internal solar rotation .",
    "the simulated meridional flow at the bottom of the solar convection zone has an amplitude of about 10  ms@xmath89 that is not small compared to the surface flow .",
    "the near - bottom equator - ward flow can be important for the solar dynamo .",
    "the meridional flow in stars rotating faster than the sun is increasingly concentrated in boundary layers near the top and bottom of the convection zone as the rotation rate increases .",
    "we interpret this boundary - layer structure of the meridional flow as an effect of thin boundary layers where taylor  proudman balance is violated .",
    "the change of the meridional flow from distributed to boundary - layer structure may be the reason for the change of dynamo regime between slow and fast rotators @xcite .",
    "the differential rotation model was applied to four individual stars including two moderate ( @xmath3  days ) and two fast ( @xmath2  day ) rotators . in two cases ,",
    "for which the structure parameters of the stars are well known , close agreement with observations was found . in all cases ,",
    "the computed rotation laws were not so close to the @xmath90-profile of equation ( [ 18 ] ) as it is for the sun .",
    "the computations for the rapidly rotating ( @xmath91  day ) _ zams_-stars show that the surface temperature , @xmath92 , is a convenient parameter for the differential rotation : when considered as a function of @xmath92 , the differential rotation loses its dependence on the chemical composition of a star that otherwise can be quite pronounced .",
    "the differential rotation increases with @xmath92 and the rotation rate difference between equator and poles can reach almost 1  radday@xmath89 for the hottest f - stars we considered .",
    "this strong differential rotation is , however , not efficient for dynamos .",
    "the standard @xmath1-parameter of the dynamo models of equation ( [ 1 ] ) that measures the efficiency of toroidal field production by differential rotation _ decreases _ with @xmath92 .",
    "contrary to intuitive expectation , the small differential rotation of m - stars is important for magnetic field generation",
