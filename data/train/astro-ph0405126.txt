    "during the last few years it has been established that almost all massive galaxies are hosting a super - massive black hole ( smbh ) in their centers .",
    "it has been found that the smhb mass is well correlated with the host galaxy s spheroidal component mass and with the bulge luminosity ( e.g. , kormendy & richstone 1995 ; magorrian et al.1998 ; mclure & dunlop 2001 ) .",
    "furthermore , a remarkably close correlation of the smbh mass and the stellar velocity dispersion , @xmath15 , is detected for active , as well as for non - active galaxies ( gebhardt et al.2000 ; graham et al.2001 ; merritt & ferrarese 2001 ; mclure & dunlop 2002 ; tremaine et al.2002 ) .",
    "these results , together with indications that luminous quasars reside in massive early type galaxies ( e.g. , mclure et al.1999 ; kukula et al.2001 ; nolan et al.2001 ; percival et al.2001 ; dunlop et al.2003 ) , point to a closely related formation of massive spheroidal galaxies and the formation and growth of central smbh . however , it is still under debate whether the black hole and the host galaxy formed simultaneously or whether one component formed before the other ( e.g. , silk & rees 1998 ; cattaneo et al.1999 ; salucci et al.1999 ; kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ; haiman & loeb 2001 ; menou et al.2001 ; archibald et al.2002 ; dimatteo et al.2003 ) .",
    "it is of great importance to estimate smbh masses at higher redshifts to investigate whether the relations of smbh mass with fundamental parameters of their harboring galaxies that are found for active and non - active galaxies in the local universe are already established at early cosmic epochs .",
    "recent studies of quasars at moderate ( mclure & jarvis 2002 , @xmath16 ) and high - redshifts ( shields et al.2003 , @xmath17 ; vestergaard 2004 , @xmath18 ) assume that the locally determined radius  luminosity relation can be applied up to redshifts of @xmath19 . particularly , black hole masses have been estimated for several high - redshift quasars , providing evidence that even at early cosmic times black holes with several times @xmath20 are already in place ( barth et al.2003 ; willott et al.2003 ; vestergaard 2004 ; warner et al.2004 ) .",
    "the detection of quasars at redshifts @xmath21 ( fan et al.2001 ) and black hole mass estimates well beyond @xmath22 ( bechthold et al.2003 ; netzer 2003 ) challenges black hole growth models to buildup smbhs on time scales of several times @xmath9 myr , because at @xmath23 the age of the universe is less than 0.9 gyr . however , the high - redshift @xmath24 estimates are all based on the iv civ@xmath25 emission line and the assumption of virialized gas motion .",
    "it is obviously important to use more than a single emission line to determine @xmath24 as a fundamental agn parameter .",
    "much effort has been spent to derive methods to estimate the black hole mass , @xmath24 , based on reverberation experiments and assuming virial dominated motion of the broad line region ( blr ) gas ( e.g. , kaspi et al.2000 ; peterson & wandel 1999,2000 ; wandel , peterson , & malkan 1999 ) .",
    "this results in an empirically established radius - luminosity relation , @xmath26 with e.g. @xmath27 ( kaspi et al.2000 ) .",
    "since long - term variability studies are currently not feasible for quasars , alternative methods are suggested employing single epoch emission line profile width measurements to estimate @xmath24 ( vestergaard 2002 ) .",
    "there is still some concern regarding this approach ( e.g. , krolik 2001 ) and that the r - l relation might be flatter than @xmath28 ( e.g. , peterson et al.2000 ; mclure & jarvis 2002 ; corbett et al.2003 ; netzer 2003 ; vestergaard 2002 , 2004 for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "however , using emission line profiles of h@xmath4 and iv civ@xmath25 to estimate the smbh mass of quasars yields consistent results that are on average within @xmath29%(e.g .",
    ", vestergaard 2002 ; warner et al.2003 ) .",
    "recently , mclure & jarvis ( 2002 ) suggested mgii@xmath30 to measure black hole masses . particularly for quasars at redshifts @xmath12 ,",
    "mgii  is of great interest because h@xmath4 is shifted out of the k - band . as a low ionization line mgii",
    "can be used as a well suited replacement of h@xmath1 instead of using the high ionization line iv civ@xmath25 .",
    "in addition , independent methods based on the well established @xmath31 and @xmath32 relations for active and non - active galaxies ( gebhardt et al.2000 ; ferrarese et al.2001 ; laor 2001 ; mclure & dunlop 2001,2002 ; tremaine et al.2002 ) result in consistent black hole mass estimates ( see barth 2003 ; vestergaard 2004 for a more detailed discussion ) .    in the following",
    "we present the results of smbh mass estimates for luminous quasars at redshifts @xmath0 that we observed in the near infrared to study the evolution of the feii / mgii  emission line ratio ( dietrich et al.2002a,2003a ) .",
    "we analyzed the broad emission line profiles of mgii@xmath30 and h@xmath1 .",
    "for most of the quasars we also have observed or have access to the ultraviolet spectral range that contains the strong iv civ@xmath25 emission line .",
    "hence , we could use almost always at least two emission line profiles to determine @xmath24 and for the first time to compare the obtained smbh masses .    in the following we assume @xmath33 kms@xmath34mpc@xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 . introducing @xmath37 ( netterfield et al.2002 ) instead of @xmath38 ,",
    "the luminosities at the highest redshifts would be @xmath39%  larger .",
    "hence , a slight change in luminosity will only have a minor impact on the estimated black hole mass .",
    "we have observed a sample of 15 luminous high - redshift quasars with @xmath40 up to @xmath41 ( table 1 ) .",
    "the spectra were obtained using infrared and optical spectrographs of the cerro tololo inter - american observatory at chile ( osiris , 4 m ) , the eso observatories at la silla ( sofi , 3.5 m ) and paranal ( isaac , 8.2 m ) at chile , the calar alto observatory ( twin , 3.5 m ) at spain , and the w.m.keck observatory ( nirspec , 10 m ) at hawaii ( for more details on the observations see dietrich et al.1999,2002a,2003a ; dietrich & wilhelm - erkens 2000 ) . in order to study the broad ultraviolet feii  emission and",
    "the mgii@xmath30 emission line ratio j , h , and k - band spectra were recorded .",
    "for the quasars with @xmath11 we observed in the k - band the rest frame optical wavelength range which covers h@xmath1 and [ oiii]@xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , for 10 of the studied quasars we have ultraviolet spectra of the iv civ@xmath25 emission line ( dietrich et al.2002b ) .",
    "for each of the high - redshift quasars we measured the emission line profile width of h@xmath4 , mgii@xmath30 , and iv civ@xmath25 if covered . to determine a reliable profile width it is necessary to identify and to remove potential contamination by additional emission features .",
    "although the mgii@xmath30 emission line doublet appears to be relatively isolated in quasar spectra , it is embedded in the superposition of many thousands of discrete ultraviolet feii  emission lines that form broad emission blends ( e.g. , wills , netzer , & wills 1985 ) .",
    "the careful correction for ultraviolet fe emission yields a more solid measurement of the mgii   profile width than assuming a linear pseudo - continuum beneath the mgii   emission line .",
    "the contamination of h@xmath4 by optical feii  emission is less severe ( e.g. , boroson & green 1992 ) .",
    "iv civ@xmath25 suffers only minor contamination of weak emission lines , like niv]@xmath43 in the blue wing and from feii  emission beneath the iv civ  line profile ( e.g. , vestergaard & wilkes 2001 ) . to account for these emission line profile contaminations we analyzed the high redshift quasar spectra using a multi - component fit approach ( dietrich et al.2002a,2003a ) .",
    "following wills , netzer , & wills ( 1985 ) we used the following four components to reconstruct each quasar spectrum , ( i ) a power - law continuum ( f@xmath44 ) , ( ii ) balmer continuum emission ( grandi 1982 ; storey & hummer 1995 ) , ( iii ) feii  emission templates for the ultraviolet and optical wavelength range ( vestergaard & wilkes 2001 ; boroson & green 1992 ) , and ( iv ) and gaussian profiles to account for individual broad emission lines , such as h@xmath1 , mgii , and iv civ .",
    "the power - law continuum fit to the individual quasar spectra was iteratively determined taking into account the measured strength of the feii   emission and balmer continuum emission derived by the fitting process .",
    "the emission line profile widths , expressed as full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) which we measured for h@xmath1 , mgii , and iv civ  if are accessible , are given in table 2 , together with the spectral slope @xmath45 of the power - law continuum . since the spectral resolution of the infrared spectra is of the order of @xmath46 to 500 kms@xmath34 ( table 2 ) , a correction of the measured profile width with respect to the instrumental resolution is not necessary .      the empirically justified radius - luminosity relation , @xmath26 ( e.g. , @xmath27 , kaspi et al.2000 ) and the assumption of virial dominated motion of the broad line region ( blr ) gas ( peterson & wandel 1999 ; onken & peterson 2002 ) has led to equations which connect the black hole mass @xmath24 with observationally accessible parameters like luminosity and emission line profile width .",
    "we applied the equations given by kaspi et al.(2000 ) , mclure & jarvis ( 2002 ) , vestergaard ( 2002 ) , and warner et al.(2003 ) to estimate the black hole mass for the high - redshift quasars we observed .",
    "the explicit form of the equations we employed , are presented in the appendix for h@xmath1 , mgii@xmath30 , and iv civ@xmath25 .",
    "it should be kept in mind that although iv civ@xmath25 is a high - ionization emission line , in contrast to h@xmath1 and mgii@xmath30 as typical low - ionization lines , there are good reasons to assume that the broad line iv civ  emitting gas motion also is gravitationally dominated ( peterson & wandel 2000 ) .",
    "this assumption is based on variability response , the emission line profile shape , and the relation of the profile widths of h@xmath1 and iv civ@xmath47 combined with variability time lags ( onken & peterson 2002 ) .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that using emission line profiles of h@xmath1 and of iv civ@xmath25 to estimate the smbh mass of quasars yields consistent results on average ( e.g. , vestergaard 2002 ; warner et al.2003 ) .",
    "we applied the equations ( a1 ) to ( a5 ) given in the appendix together with the emission line profile widths of h@xmath4 , mgii , and iv civ  and the spectral index @xmath45 of the continuum slope ( table 2 ) , to calculate the mass of the smbh for each of the high - redshift quasars . to estimate the uncertainty of the determined smbh masses the errors of the emission line profile width measurements and of the continuum luminosity",
    "have been propagated . in table 3",
    "the resulting black hole masses for each emission line estimator are presented . in figure 1",
    "the black hole mass is displayed for each emission line as a function of redshift .",
    "the luminous quasars under study have black hole masses in the range of @xmath48 up to @xmath49 .",
    "the smbh mass based on the h@xmath4 profile width are consistent within a factor of @xmath50 , with lower mass estimates provide by the relation suggested by mclure & jarvis ( 2002 ) compared to those of kaspi et al.(2000 ) .",
    "this difference is mainly caused by the different slopes of the applied r ",
    "l relation . assuming",
    "a slope of @xmath51 instead of @xmath27 will result in @xmath52 times lower @xmath24 estimates .",
    "utilizing the iv civ  emission line profile width , the resulting smbh mass estimates , using equations a3 and a4 as given in the appendix , are consistent within @xmath53% , as expected since the same slope is assumed for the r ",
    "l relation ( eqs . a3 and a4 ) .",
    "the scatter of the two smbh estimates based on iv civ  are due to the use of the individual spectral index @xmath45 for each quasar that we determined instead of using a uniform continuum slope of @xmath54 for example .",
    "furthermore , to use the continuum luminosity l(1450  ) for each quasar an additional @xmath45-dependent factor is introduced . in spite of these modifications",
    "the resulting black hole mass estimates , using the iv civ  profile width , agree well with each other .",
    "close inspection of figure 3 obviously shows that the @xmath24 estimates based on mgii  are systematically lower than the ones based on h@xmath1 and iv civ@xmath25 . on average the mgii@xmath30 emission line profile indicates a @xmath5 lower smbh mass than the h@xmath4 and iv civ@xmath25 line profile .",
    "for each of the high - redshift quasars we calculated a mean smbh mass based on h@xmath1 , mgii , and iv civ  if available ( table 3 ) .",
    "although the smbh mass estimates based on mgii  are lower than those given by h@xmath4 and iv civ , we do not apply possible corrections ( see sect.4.2 ) .      a basic assumption of the r ",
    "l relation involving the mgii@xmath30 emission line is that the emission regions of mgii  and h@xmath1 are nearly at the same distance from the central continuum source . while the comparison of the profile width of both emission lines indicate that @xmath55 is nearly identical with @xmath56 ( mclure & jarvis 2002 ) , corbett et al.(2003 ) find that mgii  has generally a broader profile than h@xmath1 . in figure 2",
    "we compare the fwhm of the line profiles of mgii  and h@xmath1 for the seven quasars at @xmath11 . with the exception of q2050@xmath57359 and q0105@xmath572634 ( similar width ) and q2348@xmath574025 ( larger mgii  profile than h@xmath1 ) the h@xmath4 profile is generally slightly broader than the mgii  profile .",
    "the average ratio of the fwhm of the h@xmath1 to mgii@xmath30 line profile amounts to @xmath58 based on the seven @xmath11 quasars we studied .",
    "the most direct measure of the blr radius for mgii  is given by reverberation mapping experiments .",
    "so far , almost all monitoring campaigns dedicated to agns have been focused in the optical on the h@xmath4 region and in the ultraviolet on the ly@xmath45 ",
    " iii ciii]@xmath59 wavelength range .",
    "however , for ngc5548 ( clavel et al.1991 ; peterson et al.1991 ; dietrich & kollatschny 1995 ) and ngc3783 ( reichert et al.1994 ; stirpe et al.1994 ) mgii@xmath30 and h@xmath4 were measured .",
    "ngc3783 showed only minor mgii  emission line flux variations during the seven month campaign in 1992 .",
    "the derived emission line flux variation delays for mgii  and h@xmath1 are of the same order of @xmath60 days ( reichert et al.1994 ; stirpe et al.1994 ) .",
    "in contrast , ngc5548 underwent quite strong variations for h@xmath1 and mgii  during the first year of its monitoring in 1989 .",
    "dietrich & kollatschny ( 1995 ) used the ngc5548 observations taken with iue in the ultraviolet ( clavel et al.1991 ) and from the ground - based monitoring campaign ( peterson et al.1991 ) to estimate a typical radius of the mgii@xmath30 and h@xmath1 emission line regions .",
    "they determined time delays based on the centroid ( @xmath61 ) , as well as on the peak ( @xmath62 ) , of the interpolated cross - correlations function ( iccf ) .",
    "the time delays based on the iccf centroid amount to @xmath63d and @xmath64d , while the peak of the iccf yield delays of @xmath65d and @xmath66d ( dietrich & kollatschny 1995 ) . assuming that these delays represent typical distances of the line emitting gas from the central variable continuum source , in the case of ngc5548",
    "the mgii  gas is located @xmath52 times more distant than the h@xmath1 emitting region . in a very simplified model of gravitationally bound keplerian orbits it can be expected that the typical velocity of mgii  is about @xmath67 times narrower than for h@xmath1 .",
    "however , this estimate of @xmath68(mgii ) is based on only one seyfert galaxy .",
    "although this result is quite consistent with the ratio of the profile widths of h@xmath4 to mgii  that we find for the high - redshift quasars ( figure 2 and table 2 ) , it is necessary to measure @xmath68(mgii ) for more seyfert galaxies and quasars . since a larger distance of the mgii  blr emitting region than for h@xmath1 will introduce a factor of @xmath69 , the estimated smbh mass will be slightly underestimated assuming @xmath70 .      to compare the smbh mass with the bolometric luminosity , @xmath71 , and to determine the eddington luminosity ratio , @xmath72",
    ", we calculated @xmath71 . to transform measured rest frame luminosities @xmath73 into @xmath71 scaling factors",
    "are provided by e.g. elvis et al.(1994 ) and kaspi et al.(2000 ) .",
    "most recently , vestergaard ( 2004 ) and warner et al.(2004 ) present revised scaling factors for optical and ultraviolet continuum luminosities employing results of multi - frequency studies on the agn spectral energy distributions from x - ray energies to the mid - infrared wavelength range .",
    "they found consistent scaling factors which are slightly smaller ( @xmath29% ) than previously assumed .",
    "we used the relation @xmath74 to calculated the bolometric luminosity ( warner et al.2004 ) for each of the high - redshift quasars under study ( table 1 ) . in figure 3 we plot the average smbh masses as a function of l@xmath75 . at a given l@xmath75",
    "the determined m@xmath76 of the high - redshift quasars cover a range of up to one order of magnitude in mass , similar to comparable studies for quasars at lower redshift ( e.g. , woo & urry 2003 ; vestergaard 2004 ; warner et al.2004 ) .    for a fully ionized pure hydrogen gas , i.e.",
    "@xmath77 , the eddington luminosity is given as ( rees 1984 ; peterson 1997 )    @xmath78    assuming a more realistic gas chemical composition containing hydrogen , helium , and some heavier elements will result in an additional factor @xmath79 accounting for the atomic weight per electron ( haiman & loeb 2001 ) .",
    "this will yield a 15%  higher eddington luminosity . in the following",
    "we will assume pure hydrogen gas because @xmath80 has only minor impact on @xmath81 .",
    "the eddington ratio @xmath8 is determined for each quasar individually .",
    "the mean black hole masses are used to calculate the eddington luminosity , @xmath81 , for spherical accretion .",
    "together with the bolometric luminosity , the eddington ratio , @xmath72 , is calculated ( table 3 ) .",
    "the determined @xmath72 covers a range of @xmath82 to @xmath83 which is in good agreement with results of studies of quasars sample that are dominated by low and intermediate redshift quasars ( e.g. , woo & urry 2003 ; vestergaard 2004 ; warner et al.2004 ) .",
    "hence , there is no difference regarding the eddington ratio @xmath72 for quasars at high - redshifts compared to those at lower redshift .",
    "in table 3 the smbh mass estimates based on the three emission lines h@xmath1 , mgii@xmath30 , and iv civ@xmath25 are listed for comparison .",
    "similar to previous studies there appears to be an approximate upper limit for @xmath24 at @xmath84 ( e.g. , corbett et al.2003 ; netzer 2003 ; shields et al.2003 ; vestergaard 2004 ; woo & urry 2003 ; warner et al.2003 ) .",
    "only q0105 - 2634 yields an estimate of @xmath85 ( eq.a1 ) and @xmath86 ( eq.a2 ) , respectively , based on the h@xmath1 emission line width . however , the h@xmath1 emission profile of this particular quasar has a rather low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "furthermore , the estimate @xmath87 based on the r  l relation with a slope of @xmath27 . assuming a flatter slope @xmath1 of the r ",
    "l relation , as suggested by peterson et al.(2000 ) and mclure & jarvis ( 2002 ) the mass estimate is reduced by a factor of @xmath52 and in this case within the uncertainties in better agreement with an empirical upper limit of @xmath88 which also has been suggested by umemura ( 2003 ) and rocca - volmerange et al.(2004 ) who studied early phases of galaxy formation and related black hole growth .    for two quasars at redshift @xmath11 we detected quite prominent [ oiii]@xmath42emission .",
    "it has been suggested that the emission line profile width of [ oiii]@xmath42can be used as a surrogate of the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath15 ( nelson 2000 ) . applying the relation that connects black hole mass with stellar velocity dispersion ( tremaine et al.2002 ) the use of [ oiii]@xmath42  as a smbh mass estimator has been investigated by shields et al.(2003 ) . using the emission line profile width of [ oiii]@xmath89 the estimated the mass of the black holes amount to @xmath90 ( q0256 - 0000 ) and @xmath91 ( q0302 - 0019 ) which are consistent with the masses provided by iv civ , mgii , and h@xmath1 ( table 3 ) .",
    "while the black hole mass estimates based on iv civ@xmath25 and h@xmath4 are quite consistent , the @xmath24 estimate provided by mgii@xmath30 indicates lower masses ( table 3 ) .",
    "although r ",
    "l relations based on statistical results found for quasar samples introduce uncertainties of a factor of at least @xmath92 in the case of individual quasars ( e.g. , vestergaard 2002 ) there are some additional possibilities which may cause lower @xmath24 estimates based on mgii@xmath30 .    first , the slope @xmath4 of the @xmath93 relationship is still not well defined , varying between @xmath94 ( e.g. , kaspi et al.2000 ; peterson et al.2000 ; mclure & jarvis 2002 ; vestergaard 2002 ; netzer 2003 ) .",
    "a flatter slope in the @xmath95 relation will result in less massive black holes . while in the original analysis by kaspi et al.(2000 ) it is found that @xmath96 , there are indications that the slope is closer to @xmath97 ( peterson et al.2000 ) .",
    "mclure & jarvis ( 2002 ) derived @xmath98 for the r ",
    "l relation using mgii .",
    "they determined this flatter slope under the assumption that mgii  and h@xmath1 originate at nearly the same blr radius .",
    "hence , they used h@xmath1 reverberation results for seyfert galaxies and quasars to analyze the correlation of r@xmath99(mgii ) with the luminosity @xmath100l@xmath101 .",
    "however , assuming a slightly flatter slope of @xmath51 instead of @xmath27 will decrease the estimated black hole mass based on h@xmath1 by a factor of @xmath52 . using furthermore a slightly steeper slope for mgii  ( e.g. , @xmath51 instead of @xmath102 ) will provide on average @xmath103 times higher smbh estimates .",
    "a second aspect as discussed in sect.4.2 is the size of the mgii  emitting region .",
    "if mgii  originates at slightly larger distances to the center of the continuum emission than h@xmath1 , the estimated mass can be increased by an additional factor .",
    "currently , we suppose that the different smbh estimates provided by iv civ and h@xmath1 compared to those based on mgii  are predominantly caused by the different slopes of the r - l relations .",
    "furthermore , it is still an open question whether the r ",
    "l relation can be extrapolated to quasar luminosities since the relation is derived for active galactic nuclei with @xmath104 ergs@xmath34 ( e.g. , corbett et al.2003 ) . in the case of quasars",
    "this relation is extended to @xmath105 to @xmath106 times more luminous objects . yet , in spite of the uncertainties regarding the use of the h@xmath4 , mgii , and iv civ  emission line profiles to determine the black hole mass , we emphasize that all three emission lines indicate consistently the presence of super - massive black holes with masses of @xmath107 at redshifts up to z=5.1 .",
    "the presence of smbhs at high - redshifts and the close relation of quasar activity and galaxy formation provide valuable constraints on the epoch when these smbhs had to start to grow in their forming host galaxies .",
    "the time span that is necessary to build - up a @xmath108 smbh can be described by an e - folding time for the growth of a single seed black hole ( e.g. , haiman & loeb 2001 ) .",
    "we use the following equation to estimate the e - folding time scale and hence the epoch when the seed black hole started to grow ( salucci et al.1999 )    @xmath109    with @xmath110 as time elapsed from the initial time , @xmath111 , to the observed time , @xmath112 , @xmath113 as seed black hole mass , @xmath114 as eddington ratio , @xmath115 as efficiency to convert mass to energy , and @xmath116 as eddington time scale , with @xmath117yr ( rees 1984 ) .",
    "the eddington time @xmath116 describes the time necessary to radiate at the eddington luminosity the entire rest mass of an object .",
    "in hierarchical models for structure formation the first baryonic objects which collapsed had masses of the order of @xmath118 ( e.g. , silk & rees 1998 ; larson 2000 ; shibata & shapiro 2002 ; bromm & loeb 2003 ) .",
    "this provides upper limit estimates for @xmath113 of black holes .",
    "recent models of early star formation indicate that nearly metal free popiii stars , formed at high - redshifts ( @xmath119 ) , were predominantly very massive with @xmath120 ( e.g. , fryer , woosley , & heger 2001 ; abel , bryan , & norman 2002 ; bromm , coppi , & larson 2002 ) .",
    "the stellar remnants are expected to be of the order of @xmath121 ( e.g. , fryer 1999 ) .",
    "however , some early star formation models even indicate the possibility of black hole remnants with several times @xmath122 ( bond , arnett , & carr 1984 ) . in the following the efficiency @xmath115 to convert mass to energy is assumed to be @xmath7 .",
    "it should be noted that the efficiency @xmath115 can reach values up to @xmath123 for a maximal rotating kerr black hole .",
    "we employed equation ( 2 ) to derive the time @xmath124 which is necessary to accumulate the determined mean black hole mass ( table 3 ) for seed black holes with @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 , respectively .",
    "we find that the time @xmath124 to build - up a smbh is between several 100 myr and @xmath128 gyr , i.e. , almost always @xmath129 is smaller than the age of the universe at the corresponding redshift . to illustrate this in a proper way we used @xmath124 to calculate @xmath130 ,",
    "i.e. the epoch when the smbh , observed at @xmath112 , started to form .",
    "in figure 4 the time @xmath130 is displayed as a function of the observed redshift @xmath131 .",
    "the determined time scales @xmath124 and hence @xmath130 indicate that most of the smbh residing in the observed high - redshift quasars started to grow at redshifts of @xmath132 .",
    "as can be seen for low massive black hole seeds , i.e. , stellar remnants with @xmath133 some black holes had to have started to grow at very early epochs and for q0105@xmath572634 and sdss0388@xmath1340021 the required time @xmath124is even larger than the actual cosmic age at @xmath131 . to avoid too long growing times @xmath129 ,",
    "higher @xmath113 masses appear to be favored . assuming high mass seed black holes with @xmath135 , the smbh in the @xmath11 quasars began to grow at redshifts @xmath136 and earlier .",
    "the luminous quasars at redshifts @xmath13 show a smaller scatter for @xmath130 compared to those at @xmath11 . based on our results the smbh residing in the @xmath137 quasars started at @xmath132",
    ". however , stellar mass black hole seed are still a valid option because a flatter slope of the r ",
    "l relation for h@xmath1 with @xmath138 ( peterson et al.2000 ; mclure & jarvis 2002 ) will yield about two times less massive black holes .",
    "hence , the eddington luminosity will be reduced and the eddington ratio will be increased . as a result",
    "the growing time scale @xmath129 will decrease and smbhs can be built - up with stellar mass remnants as black hole seeds as well .",
    "it is remarkable that most of the super - massive black holes of the studied high - redshift quasars are in place at the end of the era of reionization of the universe which is supposed to end at @xmath19 ( e.g. , becker at al.2001 ; fan et al.2002 ) .",
    "particularly , for the quasars at redshifts @xmath13 we want to emphasize that the epoch when these black holes started to grow coincides with the beginning of first intense star formation that marks early phases of the host galaxy formation .",
    "this epoch of major star formation also is indicated by the chemical enrichment history of the quasar gas . to achieve the estimated metallicities of several times solar ( e.g. , dietrich et al.2003b , c )",
    "a major and intense star formation episode had to start at @xmath139 .",
    "further circumstantial evidence for a vigorous star formation phase at those high - redshifts is given by the lack of evolution of the iron/@xmath45 element ratio compared to results for local quasars ( e.g. , barth et al.2003 ; dietrich et al.2002,2003a ; freudling et al.2003 ; iwamuro et al.2002 ; maiolino et al.2003 ; thompson et al.1999 ) .",
    "the presence of super - massive black holes in luminous high - redshift quasars , the estimated time scale required to build - up black holes of several @xmath140 , the gas metallicity of at least solar up to several times solar , and the lack of evolution of the relative iron/@xmath45 element abundance ratio provide evidence that those quasars reside in already mature host galaxies , at least with an evolved massive central component ( hamann et al.2004 ) .",
    "while the massive galaxy is forming , i.e. , major and vigorous star formation activity occurs , the super - massive black hole grows .",
    "it takes about @xmath82 gyr to accumulate a smbh with several times @xmath141 to @xmath142 that is necessary to power quasar activity .",
    "it takes approximately this same amount of time for a stellar population to enrich the gas around quasars to the observed solar or super - solar levels ( e.g. , dietrich et al . 2003b , c ; matteucci & padovani 1993 ; matteucci & recchi 2001 ) .",
    "therefore , by the time most quasars become visible , even at the highest redshifts , a substantially evolved stellar population is harboring the active nucleus .",
    "this conclusion is supported by some theoretical models of joint smbh ",
    "host galaxy evolution ( archibald et al.2002 , kawakatu et al.2003 ) .",
    "direct imaging studies of low redshift quasars show clearly that the host galaxies are characterized by at least moderately old , stellar populations on @xmath143kpc scale ( nolan et al.2001 ; dunlop et al.2003 ) .",
    "although there is less imaging data at higher redshifts at least some quasars still have substantial hosts ( kukula et al.2001 ) .",
    "it can be assumed that early phases of galaxy formation that are accompanied by intense and vigorous star formation also mark the era when super - massive black holes are growing from massive seed remnants ( hamann et al.2004 ) .",
    "a joint era of smbh growth and early phases of galaxy formation can be understood in the context of recently suggested galaxy formation models ( e.g. , archibald et al.2002 ; dimatteo et al.2003 ; granato et al.2001,2004 ) .",
    "these models further suggest that the @xmath144 relation evolves over cosmic time scales and is finally established in the local universe ( dimatteo et al.2003 ) . a less steep @xmath31 relation also has been suggested by shields et al.(2003 ) .",
    "this may provide an explanation to avoid huge host galaxy masses ( @xmath145 ) and large stellar velocity dispersions ( @xmath146 kms@xmath34 ) which have never been observed ( e.g. , netzer 2003 ) .",
    "we have analyzed a sample of 15 luminous high - redshift quasars ( @xmath0 ) to estimate the mass of super - massive black holes . for the first time results for @xmath24 based on three different emission lines , iv civ , mgii , and h@xmath1 ,",
    "are compared for high - redshift quasars .",
    "we determine black hole masses in the range of @xmath147 up to @xmath3 similar to prior studies there appears to be an approximate upper limit for @xmath24 at @xmath84 .",
    "the black hole mass estimates based on iv civ  and h@xmath4 are quite consistent while mgii  indicates by a factor of @xmath148 lower smbh masses . in spite of the uncertainties regarding the use of the h@xmath4 , mgii , and iv civ  emission line profiles to determine the black hole mass , all three emission lines indicate consistently the presence of super - massive black holes with masses on average @xmath149 at redshifts up to z=5.1 .",
    "we determine an eddington luminosity ratio of @xmath72 in the range of @xmath82 to @xmath83 .",
    "this is consistent with results of studies of quasars sample that are dominated by low and intermediate redshift quasars .",
    "this indicates that high - redshift quasars are not different regarding the eddington ratio @xmath72 compared to those at lower redshift .",
    "to date the epoch when the smbhs which drive high - redshift quasar activity should have started to grow , we assume logarithmic growth by spherical accretion with a mass to energy conversion efficiency of @xmath7 . generally , the growth - time @xmath129 is of the order of several @xmath9 myr assuming higher mass seed black holes ( @xmath150 ) the smbh in the @xmath11 quasars begun to grow at redshifts @xmath136 and earlier while the quasars with @xmath13 started at @xmath132 .",
    "the presence of super - massive black holes in luminous high - redshift quasars , the estimated time scale required to build - up black holes of several times @xmath140 , the several times solar gas metallicity and the lack of evolution of the relative iron/@xmath45 element abundance ratio provide evidence that luminous quasars at high - redshift reside in already mature host galaxies , at least with an substantially evolved massive central stellar component .",
    "this result indicates that early phases of massive galaxy formation that are accompanied by intense and vigorous star formation also mark the era when super - massive black holes are growing from massive seed remnants .",
    "the estimated black hole growth time scale suggest a delay of about @xmath82 gyr of the quasar activity with respect to preceding intense star formation which is consistent with the observed high gas metallicity .",
    "we dedicate this paper to the memory of richard j. elston , who left us far too early on january 26 , 2004 .",
    "md and fh acknowledge support from nasa grant nag 5 - 3234 and nsf grant ast-99 - 84040 ( university of florida ) .",
    "the equations we applied , given by kaspi et al.(2000 ) , mclure & jarvis ( 2002 ) , vestergaard ( 2002 ) , and warner et al.(2003 ) have been modified for the use of the continuum luminosity @xmath151 that we measured at @xmath152  for each of the high - redshift quasars of this study .",
    "we explicitly present the dependence on the spectral index @xmath45 which transforms the continuum luminosity measured at different wavelengths .",
    "the uniform use of @xmath153 does not introduce an additional uncertainty , because instead of assuming a fixed continuum slope @xmath45 to rescale @xmath154 as in prior studies we used the measured continuum slope @xmath155 for each quasar which we determined for the power - law continuum fit ( @xmath156 , table 2 ) in the multi - component analysis of the quasar spectra ( dietrich et al.2002a,2003a ) .",
    "the continuum slope is measured for a wavelength range of @xmath157   ( @xmath158 quasars ) and @xmath159   ( @xmath160 quasars ) .    for the h@xmath1 emission line profile we determined @xmath24 applying the equation given by kaspi et al.(2000 )",
    "( eq.a1 ) and presented by mclure & jarvis ( 2002 ) ( eq.a2 ) .",
    "the main difference is given by the slope of the radius  luminosity ( r  l ) relation .",
    "the black hole mass is estimated based on the iv civ@xmath25 line profile width applying the following equations ( vestergaard 2002 , eq.a3 ; warner et al.2003 , eq.a4 ) .",
    "warner et al.(2003 ) assumed that the radius of the iv civ  blr is half the size of the h@xmath4 emitting region which is well justified by variability studies ( peterson 1993 ) .",

    "<S> we investigated a sample of 15 luminous high - redshift quasars ( @xmath0 ) to measure the mass of their super - massive black holes ( smbh ) and compare , for the first time , results based on iv civ , mgii , and h@xmath1 emission lines at high - redshifts . assuming gravitationally bound orbits as dominant broad - line region gas motion , we determine black hole masses in the range of @xmath2 up to @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> while the black hole mass estimates based on iv civ  and h@xmath4 agree well , mgii  typically indicates a factor of @xmath5 lower smbh masses . a flatter slope of the h@xmath1 radius  luminosity relation , a possibly steeper slope of the mgii  radius  luminosity relation , and a slightly larger radius of the mgii  blr than for h@xmath1 could relax the discrepancy . in spite of these uncertainties , </S>",
    "<S> the iv civ , mgii , and h@xmath1 emission lines consistently indicate super - massive black hole masses of several times @xmath6 at redshifts up to z=5.1 . assuming logarithmic growth by spherical accretion with a mass to energy conversion efficiency of @xmath7 and an eddington ratio @xmath8 calculated for each quasar individually , we estimate black hole growth - times of the order of several @xmath9 myr which are smaller than the age of the universe at the corresponding redshift . assuming high - mass seed black holes ( @xmath10 ) the smbhs in the @xmath11 quasars began to grow at redshifts @xmath12 , while for the quasars with @xmath13 they started at @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> these estimated time scales for forming smbhs at high redshifts , together with previous studies indicating high quasar metallicities , suggest that the main smbh growth phase occurs roughly contemporaneously with a period of violent and extensive star formation in proto - galactic nuclei . </S>"
