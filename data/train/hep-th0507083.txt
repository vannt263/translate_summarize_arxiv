    "quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) in a constant magnetic field has been thoroughly investigated since the classical papers@xcite . following ref .",

    "( for reviews of noncommutative field theories ( ncft ) , see ref .. phenomenological issues of noncommutative qed have been studied , for example , in ref .. )    in this article , some sophisticated features of the dynamics in qed in a strong magnetic field are revealed .",
    "it is shown that in the approximation with the lowest landau level ( lll ) dominance the initial @xmath1 gauge symmetry in the fermion determinant is transformed into the noncommutative @xmath0 gauge symmetry . in this regime , the effective action is intimately connected with that in noncommutative qed and the original @xmath1 gauge ward - takahashi identities are broken .",
    "in fact , this dynamics yields a modified noncommutative qed in which the uv / ir mixing@xcite is absent , similarly to the case of the njl model in a strong magnetic field@xcite .",
    "however , it is not the end of the story .",
    "we show that the contribution of an infinite number of the higher landau levels ( hll s ) plays very important role for restoration of the original @xmath1 gauge symmetry .",
    "although the contribution of each hll is suppressed in an infrared region , their cumulative contribution is not ( a nondecoupling phenomenon ) .",
    "the situation is dramatically changed when the contribution of the hll s is incorporated : the transversality is restored .",
    "we also indicate the kinematic region where the lll approximation is reliable .",
    "let us study a problem in qed in a strong magnetic field @xmath2 .",
    "we consider the case with a large number of fermion flavors @xmath3 in order to justify the 1-loop approximation of fermions in the sense of @xmath4 expansion .",
    "we also choose the current mass @xmath5 of fermions satisfying the condition @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the dynamical mass of fermions generated in the chiral symmetric qed in a magnetic field@xcite .",
    "for a large running coupling @xmath8 related to the magnetic scale @xmath9 , and @xmath10 $ ] when the coupling @xmath11 is weak@xcite . ]",
    "the condition @xmath12 guarantees that there are no light ( pseudo ) nambu - goldstone bosons , and the only particles in low energy are photons in this model . as to the condition @xmath13",
    ", it implies that the magnetic field is very strong .",
    "integrating out fermions , we obtain the effective action for photons in the leading order in @xmath4 : @xmath14 with the tree level part , @xmath15 and the 1-loop part , @xmath16 ,   \\lb{action-1-loop}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and the vector field @xmath18 .",

    "although the above argument is physically convincing , there may be a potential flaw due to an infinite number of the landau levels .",
    "as will be shown , it is indeed the case in this problem : it turns out that the cumulative contribution of the hll s does not decouple .",
    "nevertheless , we first study the qed dynamics in the lll approximation where the fermion propagator is replaced by the lll one in the calculation of the effective action ( [ action-1-loop ] ) .",

    "<S> quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) in a strong constant magnetic field is investigated from the viewpoint of its connection with noncommutative qed . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that within the lowest landau level ( lll ) approximation the 1-loop contribution of fermions provides an effective action with the noncommutative @xmath0 gauge symmetry . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the ward - takahashi identities connected with the initial @xmath1 gauge symmetry are broken down in the lll approximation . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , it is shown that the sum over the infinite number of the higher landau levels ( hll s ) is relevant despite the fact that each contribution of the hll is suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> owing to this nondecoupling phenomenon the transversality is restored in the whole effective action . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematic region where the lll contribution is dominant is also discussed . </S>"
