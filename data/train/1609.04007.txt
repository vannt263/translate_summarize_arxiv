    "many cell signaling pathways involve the diffusion of messengers in the cytoplasm . in most cases",
    "these substances convey their message by binding to target molecules . furthermore , as they reach their targets they not only diffuse freely but also bind / unbind to other cell components . for long enough times , the net transport that results from the combination of free diffusion and binding / unbinding is described by _ effective diffusion coefficients _ that are weighted averages of the free coefficients of the messenger and of the substance it interacts with that depend on their concentrations and reaction rates .",
    "the universal second messenger calcium ( @xmath1 ) provides a prototypical example of this behavior .",
    "persistently high cytosolic @xmath1 concentrations lead to cell death . for this reason cells have numerous mechanisms to reduce this concentration , the fastest one of which is _",
    "buffering_. buffers are molecules that bind / unbind to / from @xmath1 ions reducing their free concentration . in doing",
    "so they also alter the spatio - temporal cytosolic @xmath1 distribution  @xcite ,  @xcite and the effect of the resulting signals on the eventual end responses  @xcite .",
    "this means that the time and spatial range of action of @xmath1 as messenger is strongly dependent on the @xmath1 concentration itself .",
    "there is a large variety of intracellular @xmath1 signals ranging from those that arise upon the opening of a single @xmath2 channel on the plasma membrane or on the membrane of intracellular stores to those that manifest themselves as @xmath1 waves that travel throughout the whole cell  @xcite .",
    "this in turn implies that the cytosolic @xmath1 concentration attains very different values depending on the signal type .",
    "the resulting @xmath1 effective diffusion coefficient then varies across disparate values depending on the signal type .",
    "the range of values was estimated to be @xmath3 [ 5 , 220 ] * @xmath4 *  @xcite with increasing values as the cytosolic @xmath1 concentration increased . how fast can @xmath1 diffuse inside cells ? in order to answer this question it is necessary to have separate estimates of the @xmath1 and @xmath1 buffers free diffusion coefficients , their concentrations and reactions rates . ideally , having access to this information one could eventually compute the @xmath1 effective diffusion coefficient as a function of its concentration .",
    "one could wonder why having access to this information would be necessary to study @xmath1 signals .",
    "after all , they can be observed in intact cells using @xmath1 dyes .",
    "the @xmath1 dye fluorescence , however , provides information on the @xmath1-bound dye concentration which distribution depends on the dye kinetic and transport properties . in particular , @xmath1 signals that are evoked via the photo - release of caged compounds with uv light are imaged using single wavelength dyes that increase their fluorescence when bound to @xmath1  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "it was shown in bruno et al .",
    ", 2010  @xcite that @xmath1 current estimates inferred from images that use such dyes are quite sensitive to uncertainties in the on rate of the @xmath1-dye binding reaction and in the diffusion coefficient of the dye , two parameters that are usually poorly known . having reliable estimates of these parameters is thus unavoidable to extract quantitative information from images of @xmath1 signals and allow the effective interplay between modeling and experiment that is necessary to attain a comprehensive description of the signals . in this paper",
    "we describe and implement an approach that shows how performing sets of _ fluorescence correlation spectroscopy _ ( fcs )  @xcite experiments under different conditions and using a reaction - diffusion model to interpret the experimental results it is possible to obtain separate estimates of these key biophysical parameters .    in fcs",
    "the fluorescence intensity in a small volume is recorded along time and , via an analysis of the temporal autocorrelation of the observed fluctuations , the transport rates of the fluorescent species are , in principle , derived  @xcite .",
    "fcs has been widely used to determine the diffusion coefficients of fluorescently labeled proteins inside cells  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "when the fluorescent species diffuse freely in mediumthere is an analytic expression for the autocorrelation function of the fluorescent fluctuations ( acf ) that is used to fit the experimental observations and derive diffusion coefficients ( see materials and methods ) .",
    "when the fluorescent particles diffuse and react , simple analytic expressions for the acf can only be obtained under certain approximations  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in particular ,",
    "we have shown in sigaut et al . , 2010  @xcite ( see also  @xcite , @xcite ) , that when the reactions occur on a somewhat faster timescale than diffusion the correlation time of the fluctuations is determined by the effective diffusion coefficients mentioned before .",
    "our theoretical studies showed that information on reaction rates could also be derived from the fitting  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a practical implementation of such an approach in which the experimental conditions are changed so as to maximize the information that can be drawn from the data .",
    "more specifically , we do it for the case of @xmath1 and single wavelength @xmath1 dyes .",
    "this case shares some common features with the case in which proteins diffuse and react , but it differs slightly since fluctuations are also due to changes in fluorescence intensity associated to the @xmath1-dye binding / unbinding reaction .",
    "this requires the development of a new theoretical framework that we introduce in this paper as well .    in order to advance with the practical implementation presented here we first study theoretically the behavior of the acf for a case with @xmath1 and a single wavelength dye .",
    "we derive an analytic approximation under the assumption that the @xmath1-dye reaction occurs on a fast timescale .",
    "we compare this approximated acf with the one without approximations computed numerically and determine the range of parameter values for which the approximated acf can give reasonable estimates of certain parameters .",
    "we then show the results of a series of fcs experiments performed in aqueous solutions containing @xmath2 and different amounts of the @xmath1 indicator fluo4 dextran both in its high and low affinity versions ( invitrogen - molecular probes , carlsbad , ca ) .",
    "fitting the observed acf by the analytic approximation we corroborate the validity of the approximations and derive diffusion coefficients and the off - rate of the @xmath1-dye binding reaction , in solution .",
    "a similar approach can be used to characterize the kinetic properties of other @xmath5 dyes .",
    "even if the free diffusion coefficients in solution and in the cytosol are different due to differences in viscosity between both media , we may assume that the ratio between the free diffusion coefficients of any two substances remains the same in both settings .",
    "this is particularly relevant , because by solely quantifying the rate of diffusion of a molecule that diffuses freely in the cytosol and in solution we can infer the free diffusion coefficient of @xmath1and the dyes in the cytosol as well .",
    "we present such quantification in the appendix .",
    "thus , the practical implementation presented in this paper not only highlights the advantages of our approach but it also allows us to derive information that is key to quantify the free @xmath5 distribution that underlies a @xmath1 image .",
    "@xmath1 signals are not the only example in which being able to tell apart the contributions of free diffusion and reactions on the net transport rate of labeled substances is relevant .",
    "we have recently shown  @xcite the necessity of going beyond the description of effective coefficients to interpret correctly the apparently disparate estimates of the protein , bicoid , diffusion coefficient derived from fcs  @xcite and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( frap )  @xcite experiments .",
    "this example also shows that the comprehensive quantifiable description of a physiological process requires having a biophysical model for the dynamics of the relevant concentrations that depends on concentration - independent biophysical parameters .",
    "it is via such a model that the response of the system over time in front of different stimuli can be predicted .",
    "being able to derive estimates of the concentration - free biophysical parameters _ in situ _ is thus relevant to achieve a meaningful description . the approach presented in this paper can be adapted and applied to other problems",
    "therefore , its relevance goes beyond quantifying the biophysical parameters associated to @xmath1 and its dyes .",
    "fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( fcs ) monitors the fluctuation of the fluorescence in a small volume .",
    "fluctuations are characterized by the time - averaged autocorrelation function ( acf ) which is defined as :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the average fluorescence in the sampling volume and @xmath8 is the deviation with respect to this mean at each time , @xmath9 . as explained in the appendix , when the fluorescence comes from a single species , @xmath10 , that diffuses freely with coefficient @xmath11 ( i.e. , does not react ) the acf is of the form :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the aspect ratio of the sampling volume and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the sizes of the beam waist along @xmath16 and @xmath17 , with @xmath16 the spatial coordinate along the beam propagation direction and @xmath17 a radial coordinate in the perpendicular plane ; the effective volume is @xmath18 ; @xmath19 is the characteristic time of diffusion of the particles across the sampling volume and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the particle concentration .",
    "when the dynamics of the fluorescent species is described by a reaction - diffusion model most often there is not a simple analytic expression for the acf .",
    "it can always be written as a sum of integrals each one associated to one of the branches of eigenvalues that rule the dynamics of the linearized reaction ",
    "diffusion equations of the model .",
    "each of these integrals is called a `` component '' of the acf . in the case of interest for the present paper",
    "there are three relevant species : free @xmath1 ( ca ) , free dye ( @xmath22 ) and @xmath1-bound dye ( @xmath23 ) , which diffuse with free coefficients @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , and @xmath26 ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) and react according to :    @xmath27    with on- and off - rates , @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively .",
    "the corresponding ( spatially uniform ) equilibrium concentrations , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 satisfy :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the total dye concentration .",
    "there are three branches of eigenvalues for this system and the acf then has three components .",
    "simple algebraic expressions can be obtained for the components in certain limits . in particular",
    ", in this paper we present the results obtained in the `` fast reaction limit '' that holds when the characteristic time of the reaction eq .",
    "( [ eq : reaction ] ) is shorter than the time it takes for the species to diffuse across the observation volume ( i.e. , if @xmath36 ) . for more details",
    "see the appendix where we also compare the `` full '' ( integral expression of the ) acf computed numerically with the analytic approximation derived in the fast reaction limit that is presented in the results section and some of their components separately .",
