    "logarithmic models of two - dimensional conformal field theory with @xmath1 symmetry have been addressed in @xcite . here",
    ", we approach logarithmic @xmath1 models from the theory of nichols algebras  @xcite .",
    "the major advantages are that ( i )  we then have a recipe for seeking the _ extended chiral algebra _ : as ( the maximal local algebra in ) the kernel of nichols algebra generators represented by screening operators  @xcite , and ( ii )  very strong hints about the chiral algebra representation theory come from the nichols - algebra side .",
    "our starting point is therefore brazenly algebraic  a braiding matrix @xmath3 , which is just a collection of factors defining the diagonal braiding of generators of a nichols algebra .",
    "finite - dimensional nichols algebras with diagonal braiding have been impressively classified @xcite ; in the spirit of  @xcite , this calls for translating the available structural results into the language of logarithmic cft models .",
    "we here go beyond the case of rank-@xmath4 nichols algebras  @xcite , and in rank  @xmath5 select two braiding matrices @xmath6 with an integer @xmath7 .",
    "a characteristic result deduced from is the triplet  triplet extended algebra @xmath8 that centralizesthe nichols algebra ( the one corresponding to @xmath9 with @xmath10 , for definiteness ) : it extends @xmath1 at the level @xmath11 and is generated by dimension-@xmath12 fields @xmath13 where @xmath14 are @xmath1 primaries of charge @xmath15 , constructed in a free - field realization associated with the chosen braiding matrix , and @xmath16 is an @xmath1 singular vector operator .",
    "the algebra is triplet  triplet because @xmath17 , together with a  @xmath18 , make up a triplet , and in addition each @xmath19 is part of a triplet under the zero - mode subalgebra  of  @xmath1 .",
    "other results include a similar construction for the second braiding matrix , the `` triplet  multiplet '' @xmath0-algebras that extend some other fractional - level @xmath1 , and links between the extended algebras and certain hopf - algebraic counterparts .",
    "the reader is also invited to `` _ _ logarithmic @xmath1 cft models from nichols algebras . @xmath20 _ _ '' with @xmath21 for modular transformations of the extended ( pseudo)characters , fusion of representations , etc .",
    "part of our effort , in this paper especially , is given to grasping the general principles governing how a given nichols algebra can be `` mapped '' into a logarithmic  cft .",
    "we refrain from claiming , except in private , that a collection of roots of unity @xmath22 contains exactly as much information as is needed for uniquely reconstructing a cft model . what precisely the extra input consists of was a major part of the intrigue in writing this paper .",
    "one such input is @xmath23 in each case in  . when realizing the @xmath22 as the braiding of screening operators , the range of @xmath23 is promoted from @xmath24 to @xmath25 ( hence an arbitrariness ) , with drastic consequences for logarithmic theories with different  @xmath23 ( we actually consider @xmath26 for @xmath9 and @xmath27 for  @xmath28 ) .",
    "the extended algebra is _ triplet  triplet _ for a single value of @xmath23 in each case , and _ triplet  multiplet _ for other @xmath23 .",
    "the theory of nichols algebras only requires that for each case in  , @xmath32 be a primitive @xmath33th root of unity .",
    "if @xmath34 ( with an odd @xmath35 coprime with @xmath33 ) is chosen instead of @xmath36 in  , then the screening operators whose braiding reproduces the braiding matrix depend on two full - fledged coprime integers , @xmath33 and @xmath37 .",
    "this is how @xmath38-type logarithmic models appear in our context . to somewhat reduce technical details ,",
    "we restrict ourself to the case @xmath39 ; the relevant @xmath1 machinery is then structurally the same as for the general @xmath40 coprime with @xmath33 , but slightly simpler to follow .",
    "thus , setting @xmath41 in and introducing the @xmath23 parameter , we effectively deal with @xmath12th roots of unity of the form @xmath42 , which is the source of @xmath43 logarithmic models that occur in what follows .",
    "the nichols algebras associated with braiding matrices in   are selected from the list of about two dozen rank - two nichols algebras with diagonal braiding @xcite based on two properties :    1 .",
    "these are not isolated but `` serial '' algebras , existing for each integer @xmath7 ( to become the @xmath33 in the labeling of logarithmic cft models ) , and 2 .",
    "at least one generator of the nichols algebra has the self - braiding factor @xmath44 , which is standardly rephrased by saying that this generator is a fermion .    because nichols algebra generators @xmath45 are identified with screening operators , the @xmath46 with @xmath44",
    "are generally referred to as _",
    "fermionic screenings_. fermionic screenings occur in cft models rather frequently , but are nevertheless slightly disquieting from a `` conceptual '' standpoint because of the lack of an obvious relation to root systems : while some other `` good '' systems of screenings are reproducible by rescaling classic root systems , typically by factors like @xmath47 , those with fermionic screenings are not . with the power of nichols algebras ,",
    "however , this complication passes unnoticed ; moreover , there is a procedure to extract a ( generalized ) cartan matrix @xmath48 from a braiding matrix ( dependent on several `` @xmath33-type '' parameters in general ) .",
    "such a cartan matrix is an important part of the connection between nichols algebras and conformal models , as we see shortly .",
    "the classes to which braiding matrices   belong are defined by the conditions  @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the set of primitive @xmath33th roots of unity , @xmath7 , and where we temporarily ( until  ) add the third case that is merely a @xmath51 relabeling of the first . in each case , the associated cartan matrix is the @xmath52 one , @xmath53 .",
    "the nichols algebra has dimension @xmath54 in each case .",
    "the point of contact with cft , already mentioned in the foregoing , is the interpretation of nichols algebra generators as screenings , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a @xmath57-plet of scalar fields with standard normalization , the dot denotes euclidean scalar product , and @xmath58 are called the momenta of the screenings .",
    "the relation between the screening momenta and the braiding matrix is postulated  @xcite in the form of @xmath59 equations @xmath60 and the @xmath61 logical-``or '' conditions @xmath62 imposed for each pair @xmath63 and involving the cartan matrix @xmath64 associated with the given braiding matrix .    for the braiding matrices defined by each line in  ,",
    "we solve eqs .  ",
    "( with @xmath65 ) for the scalar products of the momenta , with @xmath36 as in  .",
    "the respective solutions are @xmath66 with an arbitrary @xmath67 in each case .",
    "these three systems of @xmath68 vectors are related by weyl - groupoid pseudoreflections , which map as ( ` @xmath4 ' with respect to @xmath69 and ` @xmath5 ' with respect to @xmath70 ) @xmath71      \\ar@{{<}{-}{>}}^1[rrd ] & & &      \\\\",
    "\\overline{r}_{{\\mathrm{a}}}(j )      \\ar@{{<}{-}{>}}@(ld , rd)[]_{1 } & & & &      r_{{\\mathrm{a}}}(j )      \\ar@{{<}{-}{>}}@(ld , rd)[]_{2 }      } \\ ] ] ( in our case of a classic , @xmath52 , cartan matrix , it is the same for the entire orbit , and therefore the weyl groupoid becomes the corresponding weyl group ) .",
    "the third , `` opposite asymmetric '' case does not have to be considered separately . in",
    "what follows , we therefore speak about two``asymmetric '' and `` symmetric''systems of the screening momenta , braiding matrices , braided spaces @xmath72 and @xmath73 , nichols algebras @xmath74 and @xmath75 , etc . ; in the narrow , literal sense , the _ symmetry _ is with respect to the anti - diagonal of @xmath28 in  , but it also shows up on the cft side , as we describe below .",
    "taking @xmath78 means that the kernel of two screenings is defined more or less uniquely in a two - boson space ; there , the kernel contains parafermionic fields @xmath79 and @xmath80generators of the @xmath81 coset theory , which are mutually nonlocal .",
    "apparently , one can proceed within the theory of parafermions and their `` representations , '' but this is a challenge we are not up to , in this paper at least .",
    "instead , we introduce a third , `` auxiliary '' scalar field representing the @xmath82 in the above coset , with the ope , entailing either a choice for the sign of @xmath83 or unnecessary imaginary units . ]",
    "@xmath84 where @xmath85 in the asymmetric case and @xmath86 in the symmetric case , and use it to convert the parafermions into level-@xmath83 @xmath1 currents @xmath87 we can then use the full power of the @xmath1 representation theory , but the price is the occurrence of twisted ( spectral - flow transformed ) @xmath1 representations , because the locality requirement alone leaves a size-@xmath25 arbitrariness in how the third scalar enters the relevant operators .",
    "eliminating @xmath88 in order to return to a `` clean '' nichols - algebra - motivated two - boson conformal model is not difficult at the level of formulas ( for generators of the extended algebra , etc . ) , and can be quite interesting at the level of characters ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , but the meaning of `` algebras '' generated by mutually nonlocal fields would then have to be worked out first , before the `` three - boson '' results in this paper can be restated in that language .",
    "arbitrariness in mapping from a given nichols algebra to cft .  instead of",
    ", we could have chosen the ope @xmath89 the parafermions would then be `` dressed '' not into @xmath90 but into local fields @xmath91 with the opes @xmath92 and @xmath93(z - w)^{-n-2}+\\dots$ ] .  for @xmath94 ,",
    "in particular , @xmath95 and @xmath96 generate the @xmath97 super - virasoro algebra .",
    "the `` parafermionic core '' of all these theories with different @xmath98 is the same .",
    "the value @xmath99 chosen in   and corresponding to @xmath1 is the lowest in the sense that taking @xmath100 leads to unconventional theories where @xmath101 ( and @xmath102 ) has a nonvanishing ope with itself .",
    "we do not return to this point here and stay with  . ]",
    "the @xmath1 algebra is used as a seed to grow extended algebras living in the kernel of the screenings inside @xmath1 representations .",
    "the relevant representations are wakimoto - type modules  @xcite .",
    "these modules are related by intertwining maps , which can also be associated with screenings  @xcite , and the intersection of the screening kernels we are interested in is the socle of such modules ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in the kernel , we select mutually local fields , and among them , @xmath1 primaries with the minimal sugawara dimension as generators of the _ extended algebra_a @xmath0-algebra of mutually local fields in the kernel .",
    "the generators come in a triplet @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 and , moreover , each of these is also a multiplet with respect to the zero - mode @xmath108 subalgebra of  @xmath1 .",
    "we construct the @xmath0-algebra generators as explicitly as the celebrated construction  @xcite of @xmath1 singular vectors allows .",
    "the @xmath0-algebras constructed in the asymmetric and symmetric realizations are isomorphic and are in fact related as two `` rebosonizations '' of the wakimoto representation , as we discuss in  * [ sec : wak]*.    for the asymmetric realization ( the top row in  ) for definiteness , with @xmath109 , the three generators have the ( sugawara ) dimension @xmath110 and each is part of a @xmath111-plet with respect to the zero - mode @xmath108 algebra . the cases @xmath10 ( dimension @xmath12 and zero - mode _ triplets_)and @xmath112 are essentially different . for @xmath10 ,",
    "the @xmath105 field is a pure exponential , and there exists a `` long '' screening in  @xcite , and @xmath1 in this paper ) . ]",
    "mapping as @xmath113 ; for @xmath114 , by contrast , all three fields ( denoted as @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 ) have the form of a differential polynomial times an exponential and the long screening does not map that way .",
    "another characteristic illustration of the difference is the result of hamiltonian reduction to single - boson models : to the @xmath118 triplet algebra @xcite for @xmath10 and to the triplet algebras of @xmath38 logarithmic models introduced in  @xcite ( also see  @xcite ) for @xmath114 ( with @xmath119 due to our choice of @xmath36 in  , as discussed above ) .",
    "models @xcite and somewhat worse for @xmath38 models  @xcite .",
    "modular transformations are remarkably robust , however : they are the same on the cft and hopf - algebraic sides of @xmath38 models  @xcite . ]",
    "our `` @xmath0-style '' notation for the triplet ",
    "triplet algebra ( corresponding to @xmath10 in the asymmetric realization ) is @xmath8 , where @xmath5 is the dimension of the energy ",
    "momentum tensor and @xmath12 is the dimension of all the @xmath19 fields .",
    "the first multiplicity of @xmath120 is for the superscript of the  @xmath19 fields , and the second , for the fact that each of these fields is a triplet under the zero - mode  @xmath108 .",
    "the relation between @xmath122 and the extended algebra starts working at its full strength when lifted to the level of a correspondence between the categories of their representations . on the nichols - algebra side ,",
    "the relevant representations are yetter ",
    "drinfeld @xmath122 modules .",
    "the class of models that we wish to have in cft should be `` rational in a reasonably broad sense '' ( certainly with finitely many simple modules and possibly with the @xmath123 cofiniteness property  @xcite , etc . ; ultimately , the rigorous framework of  @xcite must be kept in mind ) . to avoid `` strongly nonrational '' effects",
    ", the scalar fields must take values in a torus ; in other words , a particular lattice vertex - operator algebra should be selected .    on the nichols - algebra side",
    ", the corresponding finiteness@xmath124discreteness is controlled by choosing a nonbraided hopf algebra @xmath125 used for `` ydinization , '' i.e. , representing all relevant braided spaces ( starting with @xmath126 ) as objects in  @xmath127 ( the category of yetter ",
    "drinfeld @xmath125-modules ) .",
    "such an @xmath125 is by no means unique  @xcite , and its choice is another input beyond the nichols algebra itself , because @xmath122 is independent of an @xmath125 such that @xmath128 , but the resulting representation categories acquire such a dependence . for diagonal braiding",
    ", we have @xmath129 for an abelian group  @xmath130 . , but we write @xmath131 for ( perhaps misinterpreted ) esthetic reasons . ]",
    "the choice of @xmath130 is in turn related to the representation of screenings in terms of free bosons in  : once scalar fields are introduced , there is a zero - mode operator @xmath132 for each scalar @xmath133 , and operators @xmath134 , with @xmath135 determined by the chosen lattice vertex - operator algebra , can be considered generators of @xmath130 .",
    "we do not quite study @xmath136 for @xmath128 in this paper , however , the reason being that , the results in  @xcite notwithstanding , we made a much faster progress within a more `` old - fashioned '' setting of @xmath2-modules for a double bosonization @xmath137 of our nichols algebras .",
    "double bosonization of braided hopf algebras was discussed previously in more general contexts in  @xcite ; it is to produce a nonbraided hopf algebra from a braided hopf algebra @xmath139 in @xmath127 , its dual @xmath140 , and the hopf algebra @xmath125 itself , under a number of conditions satisfied by all the ingredients .",
    "the construction `` doubles '' the standard radford bosonization ( byproduct formula )  @xcite whereby the smash product @xmath141 is endowed with the structure of a hopf algebra . for a nichols algebra @xmath122 with diagonal braiding and for a commutative cocommutative @xmath129 ,",
    "the list of double - bosonization conditions is somewhat reduced , the most essential remaining one being the symmetricity of the braiding in the standard sense @xmath142 .",
    "double bosonization then yields a ( nonbraided ) hopf algebra @xmath143 which contains the `` single '' bosonizations @xmath144 and @xmath145 as hopf subalgebras , where the prime indicates that the @xmath131 action and coaction are changed by composing each with the antipode ( they remain a left action and a left coaction for @xmath129 ) .",
    "this double bosonization previously appeared in  @xcite .",
    "we arrive at   in a way that may be interesting in and of itself , the key observation being that even without the assumption that @xmath126 is in @xmath127 ( but with diagonal braiding ) , there is an associative algebra structure on @xmath146 for an abelian group @xmath147 that is read off from the monodromy @xmath148 .",
    "this associative algebra is only `` half the way '' to   because , not surprisingly , @xmath147 is `` too coarse '' to endow @xmath149 with the structure of a yetter  drinfeld module , and for essentially the same reason , @xmath150 is not a hopf algebra .",
    "in fact , @xmath147 is generated by the squares of the generators of a `` minimal '' @xmath130 featuring in  , and @xmath150 can be considered a subalgebra in  @xmath2 .    applying   to the two ( nonisomorphic ) rank - two nichols algebras studied here , the `` asymmetric '' @xmath74 and `` symmetric '' @xmath75 , yields two @xmath151-dimensional hopf algebras @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "these turn out to be isomorphic as associative algebras : @xmath154 moreover , the two coproducts , @xmath155 and @xmath156 , are related by a similarity transformation : there exists an invertible element @xmath157 satisfying an appropriate cocycle condition such that @xmath158 for all @xmath159 .",
    "hence , in particular , the representation categories of @xmath152 and @xmath153 are equivalent as monoidal categories .",
    "the representation theory of @xmath2 is expected , at the very least , to produce hints as to the representation theory on the cft side ; but the hope  and the subject of future research  is that the category of @xmath2-modules is equivalent to the representation category of a chiral algebra . here is a subtlety , however , which has no clear - cut analogue in the @xmath160@xmath124virasoro case .",
    "only a subalgebra in @xmath8 commutes with the generators of the abelian group @xmath130 that fixes the underlying yetter  drinfeld category or , equivalently , allows constructing the double bosonization",
    ". this subalgebra does not contain @xmath162 and @xmath163 currents , but contains their squares ( normal - ordered products ) @xmath164 and @xmath165 . for consistency",
    ", the fields sitting in the middle of each triplet with respect to the zero - mode @xmath108 also have to be dropped .",
    "the triplets then become `` doublets '' with respect to @xmath166 , and the notation for this algebra is  @xmath167 .    the representation theory of @xmath2 ( developed to some depth in  @xcite ) and the representation theory of @xmath167 ( rudimentary )",
    "show as much agreement as the `` rudimentary '' one allows .",
    "in particular , there are natural candidates for irreducible @xmath167 modules .",
    "the irreducible modules are divided into spectral flow orbits , which are in a @xmath168 correspondence ( not only in number , but also as @xmath130-modules ) with the @xmath2 simple modules .",
    "it is for the representation category of @xmath167 that we expect a number of `` good '' properties resembling those of @xmath160-models  @xcite .",
    "although the existing data is scarce , it is very tempting to conjecture that much information about the representation category of @xmath167 ( including fusion and , possibly , modular transformations ) can be obtained from investigating the @xmath2 category .",
    "the braiding matrix elements are defined such that @xmath169    the notations for conformal fields , such as @xmath170 and @xmath171 , are `` local '' to each case , asymmetric ( sec .",
