    "2002 , haffner et al .",
    "2003 , wham ) have resulted in detailed maps , which revealed the presence of diffuse , highly structured h@xmath0 radiation at high galactic latitudes .",
    "although questions about the inferred ionization sources for diffuse , ionized gas outside of h ii regions in late - type galaxies have not been fully resolved ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the high - latitude h@xmath0 emission in the milky way has generally been interpreted as resulting from in - situ emission in an extended , ionized warm interstellar medium ( wim ) @xcite .",
    "this was supported by studies of the [ s ii]/h@xmath0 ratio in a limited number of selected regions @xcite and with radiative transfer models by @xcite , who concluded that scattering of h@xmath0 photons originating elsewhere in the galaxy by high - latitude dust was not a significant component of the h@xmath0 background .",
    "consequently , an all - sky h@xmath0 map by @xcite , produced through the combination of the vtss , shassa , and wham data , has been used extensively as a template for galactic free - free emission in the analysis of galactic foregrounds of the all - sky cmb observations by wmap @xcite , with the fundamental assumption that the extinction - corrected h@xmath0 intensity is directly proportional to the line - of - sight emission measure in the foreground galactic interstellar medium .",
    "the question of which physical processes are responsible for high - latitude h@xmath0 radiation was reopened recently through the analysis of the h@xmath0 excess observed in the isolated , high - latitude interstellar cloud ldn 1780 ( l = @xmath2 ; b = @xmath3 ; distance @xmath4 pc ; @xcite ) .",
    "ldn 1780 is readily identifiable as a distinct object on the map of @xcite by its excess h@xmath0 surface brightness . from an analysis of the h@xmath0 morphology , in addition to co , fir , and optical extinction maps of ldn 1780 , @xcite concluded that the observed surface brightness distribution of ldn 1780 was inconsistent with photo - ionization as the cause for the observed h@xmath0 light .",
    "photoionization by an external field of lyman continuum photons is expected to result in ionization of a thin outer shell of an isolated interstellar cloud while the observations of the h@xmath0 light from ldn 1780 clearly reveal the dense inner core of the cloud as the brightest feature ( see fig .",
    "1(bottom ) ) , showing that most of the observed h@xmath0 photons come from the densest interior structures of the cloud . to account for this phenomenon",
    ", @xcite proposed that cosmic rays caused partial ionization of the hydrogen throughout ldn 1780 , leading to the observed h@xmath0 emission . to produce the observed intensity",
    ", they postulated a locally enhanced cosmic ray flux about one order of magnitude larger than commonly accepted for the solar neighborhood .",
    "@xcite , analyzing the same ldn 1780 data from the @xcite map as @xcite , concluded instead that the h@xmath0 excess intensity in ldn 1780 and a number of other similar high - latitude clouds is more likely the result of scattering by the dust in these clouds of h@xmath0 photons produced elsewhere in the galaxy .",
    "their interpretation relies upon the facts that ( 1 ) the optical depth of ldn 1780 at the wavelength of h@xmath0 is sufficiently small so that external h@xmath0 photons from the galactic interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) can readily reach the inner structures of ldn 1780 and ( 2 ) the known albedo of interstellar dust is sufficiently high to produce the observed intensities by scattering , given the known mean intensity of the galactic radiation field in the h@xmath0 line .",
    "still more recently , @xcite analyzed the excess h@xmath0 surface brightness of the large high - latitude translucent cloud g294 - 24 and concluded that also there the excess h@xmath0 intensity can be explained solely by galactic h@xmath0 radiation scattered off dust in the cloud , thus supporting the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "the possible presence of scattered h@xmath0 radiation at high latitudes was first considered by @xcite , but subsequent monte carlo radiative transfer simulations by @xcite suggested that the scattered h@xmath0 component should be relatively small .",
    "they conclude that the scattered light from midplane h ii regions is typically around 10% of the total h@xmath0 intensity at high latitudes , with a similar fraction ( see their fig .",
    "3 ) being contributed by scattering of h@xmath0 photons emitted by the wim .",
    "thus , their models predict an average scattered h@xmath0 contribution at high latitudes of about 20% of the total h@xmath0 intensity .",
    "obvious shortfalls of the wood & reynolds model are their assumption of a smooth , unstructured ism , and more seriously , the use of the @xcite scattering phase function . the henyey - greenstein phase function is known to under - predict scattered light intensities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , when large scattering angles are involved as they are in the scattering of midplane h@xmath0 photons by high - latitude clouds",
    ".    frequently cited support for the conclusion that scattering makes only a minor contribution to the diffuse h@xmath0 background comes from wham measurements of the [ s ii]/h@xmath0 ratio cited earlier in this section , which demonstrated that this ratio is typically several times larger in the diffuse ionized interstellar medium than in bright h ii regions . if scattering of h@xmath0 photons originating in h ii regions were to dominate the h@xmath0 intensity in the diffuse ism , the [ s ii]/h@xmath0 ratio would be expected to be similar to that in h ii regions .",
    "we will show in this paper that the selection criteria in use for the [ s ii]/h@xmath0 ratio measurements conducted with wham have led to a highly biased sample of regions in which scattering indeed is a minor contributor . the [ s ii]/h@xmath0 argument , while valid in principle , has been inappropriately extended to the entire sky without sufficient observational justification .    given",
    "the ubiquity of high - latitude dust structures in the galactic cirrus @xcite , the conclusions of @xcite and @xcite have profound consequences .",
    "if a substantial fraction of the high - latitude h@xmath0 background is due to scattering rather than in - situ recombination , be that in balance to photo - ionization @xcite or cosmic ray ionization as proposed by @xcite , the template used for galactic free - free emission in the wmap analyses @xcite employed systematically intensities that were too high , as well as spatial brightness variations not actually present in the distribution of the in - situ emission component alone .",
    "in this paper we present new observations of ldn 1780 in h@xmath0 and in adjacent continuum bands with superior spatial resolution and sensitivity compared to the @xcite data .",
    "we use these new data to independently examine the case for dust scattering in ldn 1780 . scattering by dust",
    "would clearly be the phenomenon with greater consequences , because it does not require special conditions such as the locally , ten - fold enhanced cosmic ray flux postulated by @xcite . with the case for scattering made by @xcite and by @xcite confirmed ,",

    "we used two identical , remotely operated takahashi epsilon 180ed astrographs ( f/2.8 ) to obtain new imaging data for ldn 1780 .",

    "each camera was equipped with an 8-position filter wheel , jointly capable of housing 15 batc intermediate - band filters @xcite plus a narrow - band astrodon h@xmath0 filter .",
    "the filter characteristics , total exposure times , and observing dates are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the data were part of a larger program directed at studying the optical spectral energy distributions of high - latitude clouds in conjunction with spitzer infrared band observations with both the mips and irac imaging systems ( witt et al .",
    "2010 , in preparation ) .",
    "the observations were carried out under photometric conditions . both astrograph / camera systems",
    "were flux - calibrated through observations of the absolute flux standard star sao 90153 . for ldn 1780 , individual sub - exposures of 900 s each were processed through bias subtraction , flat - fielding and cosmic ray removal .",
    "atmospheric extinction corrections were applied to each 900 s sub - exposure , before co - adding them .",
    "this was particularly important in the case of ldn 1780 , because its negative declination required data acquisition over a fairly large range of air masses .",
    "we note here that the shassa data @xcite , which form the basis for the @xcite h@xmath0 map for ldn 1780 were not corrected for atmospheric extinction .",
    "the narrow - band h@xmath0 filter has a nearly rectangular transmission profile with 6 nm fwhm .",
    "in addition to the h@xmath0 line , this filter also transmits scattered - light continuum around h@xmath0 and possibly light from the [ n ii ] line at 654.81 nm and to a lesser extent light from the [ n  ii ] line at 658.34 line , if there is significant radiation present in these lines in ldn 1780 . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "these lines are fairly weak relative to h@xmath0 in h  ii regions but are more significant in the radiation from the wim .",
    "observations of stellar continuum sources with spectral energy distributions similar to that of ldn 1780 with the batc # 9 filter and the h@xmath0 filter were used to determine the continuum contribution passing through the finite width ( 6 nm ) of the h@xmath0 filter .    on 13 july and 14 july , 2010 , one of us ( gjm ) used the wisconsin h - alpha mapper ( wham ) , currently located at ctio , to measure the emission line ratios [ n ii]/h@xmath0 for the stronger [ n  ii ] line at 658.34 nm and [ s ii]/h@xmath0 for the [ s  ii ] line at 673.1 nm on ldn 1780 relative to the nearby sky .",
    "the 1-degree wham beam encloses the full extent of ldn 1780 as well as as substantial fraction of the adjacent sky .",
    "the excess h@xmath0 intensity of ldn 1780 , averaged over the 1-degree beam relative to three sky positions at several degrees offset ( same latitude , @xmath8 to lower l , @xmath9 to higher",
    "l ; same longitude , @xmath10 to higher b ) was found to be 0.90 r ; the h@xmath0 line profile was substantially narrower ( 18 km / s ) than commonly seen in the high - latitude wim ( 25 - 30 km / s ) .",
    "the line ratios were measured as [ n ii]/h@xmath0 = 0.19 and [ s ii]/h@xmath0 = 0.16 , rather close to corresponding values in h ii regions and much smaller than typically found in the diffuse wim @xcite .    while these recent wham measurements suggest that significant contamination of our h@xmath0 intensities on ldn 1780 by contributions from the [ n  ii ] lines is not likely , we will carry out an additional examination of this question in sect",
    ". 3 by comparing our measured intensities with those derived from the shassa data , which have been calibrated with pure wham h@xmath0 intensities and should therefore be free of [ n ii ] contamination . in the absence of contamination",
    ", we expect the two sets of h@xmath0 intensities to agree within the measurement uncertainties .",
    "we conducted differential surface brightness measurements for 378 individual circular source regions on ldn 1780 ( radius @xmath11 ) and the adjacent sky , represented by the average of 40 circular sky fields , as displayed in fig .",
    "the positions of the source regions were selected by eye to avoid contributions from stars as faint as v @xmath12  mag , yet were aimed to provide maximum surface coverage of the visible extent of ldn 1780 .",
    "the source regions were divided into five color - coded groups to distinguish regions by the dust column density through the cloud and the isrf impinging upon the dust in them ( fig .",

    "1(center ) displays the image of ldn 1780 in the narrow - band h@xmath0 filter .",
    "the morphology of ldn 1780 observed with the h@xmath0 narrow - band filter appears to be identical to that in adjacent continuum filters .",
    "given the width ( 6 nm ) of the h@xmath0 narrow - band filter , both h@xmath0 line photons as well as continuum photons are contributing to this image .",
    "1(bottom ) displays the residual h@xmath0 image of ldn 1780 , after the data in fig .",
    "1(center ) have been sky - subtracted and corrected for the continuum contribution in the narrow - band h@xmath0 filter .",
    "the latter was determined to be 12.38% of the continuum intensity measured through the broader batc # 9 filter , normalized to the same total exposure time , sky - background and extinction corrected .",
    "this image shows the excess h@xmath0 of ldn 1780 only . in order to overcome the large per pixel noise but",
    "still leave the stars as recognizable discrete sources , the image has been smoothed by a 7-pixel gaussian .",
    "the most important aspect of the resulting image is that the high - opacity inner core region ( a@xmath13 mag ; @xcite ) of ldn 1780 appears as a region of greatest h@xmath0 brightness .",
    "the implications of this fact will be discussed below in sect .",
    "other data sets employed in this study were the all - sky h@xmath0 map of @xcite and the all - sky maps of the iras 100 @xmath1 m diffuse background and the line - of - sight dust extinction maps of @xcite .",
    "finally , we used numerical data for the optical depths through ldn 1780 that were derived from the intensity at 160 @xmath1 m ( spitzer , mips ) and the dust temperatures determined by witt et al .",
    "( 2010 , in preparation ) .",
    "the dust temperatures were determined from the intensity ratios at 160 @xmath1 m ( mips ) and 100 @xmath1 m ( iras ) and thus refer to the equilibrium temperature of the large - grain population responsible for the far - infrared emission as well as the optical scattering in ldn 1780 .",
    "the temperatures of these grains were found to lie in the range 14.5 k to 16.8 k , typical for dust in interstellar clouds exposed to the isrf near the sun @xcite and in good agreement with the dust temperatures for ldn 1780 independently determined by @xcite .",
    "we note that these dust temperatures are well below the minimum temperature ( 17.35 k ) indicated by the @xcite dust temperature map for the center of ldn 1780 .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy most likely arises from the low spatial resolution of the cobe / dirbe 100 @xmath1 m and 240 @xmath1 m maps , which are the basis for the schlegel et al . temperature map . with our temperatures based on the much higher iras 100 @xmath1 m resolution",
    ", we determined the optical depth at 160 @xmath1 m for each sampling position on ldn 1780 from the relation @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the planck function for the dust temperature at the specific sampling field and @xmath16 is the corresponding measured mips intensity , both at the wavelength of 160 @xmath1 m .",
    "we examined our measurements of the continuum - corrected excess h@xmath0 intensities with regard to the reliability of our absolute calibration and the possible presence of [ n ii ] line contamination by comparing them with the corresponding measurements of the excess intensities in the finkbeiner h@xmath0 map .",
    "the two data sets differ in several important aspects .",
    "( 1 ) resolution : our data ( nms , for new mexico skies ) have a scale of 3.70@xmath6 px@xmath7 while the shassa survey , which underlies this region of the finkbeiner h@xmath0 map , was conducted with an angular scale of 47.64@xmath6 px@xmath7 , with the final resolution of the @xcite map reduced to a resolution of @xmath17 ; ( 2 ) star subtraction : our data are free of starlight contamination to the limit of v @xmath12  mag by design while the shassa survey relied upon star subtraction based on stellar images in adjacent continuum images , which was not perfect in all cases ( see @xcite and @xcite for details ) ; ( 3 ) atmospheric extinction correction : the nms data were corrected for atmospheric extinction at the sub - exposure ( 900 s ) level while the shassa data where not corrected for atmospheric extinction ; and ( 4 ) absolute calibration : the nms data were calibrated against the absolute flux standard star sao 90153 , whereas the shassa data were calibrated against sources with known h@xmath0 fluxes , with an absolute zero point based on wham h@xmath0 measurements , which are pure , uncontaminated h@xmath0 intensities .",
    "the ldn 1780 data obtained from the finkbeiner map should , therefore , be free of contamination from [ n ii ] lines , while the nms data may not be .    the comparison of the intensities measured in ldn 1780 is shown in fig .",
    "2 . in order to facilitate this comparison ,",
    "the resolution of the finkbeiner map was artificially increased to match that of the nms data .",
    "the ideal 1:1 correlation is indicated by the solid diagonal line ; the least - squares linear fit ( dashed line ) through the origin suggests that the finkbeiner intensities , on average , are about 11% higher than the corresponding nms intensities .",
    "this difference is small compared to the typical errors in each measurement represented by the error bars in fig .",
    "this independent test is consistent with our recent measurement of the [ n ii]/h@xmath0 line intensity ratio for ldn 1780 ( see sect .",
    "2 ) , which showed the [ n ii ] lines to be weak .",
    "we , therefore , conclude that contamination of the nms data by light from [ n ii ] lines passing through our h@xmath0 filter is insignificant .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "1(bottom ) , ldn 1780 stands out brightly against the surrounding sky at h@xmath0 .",
    "we further observe that both sets of measurements shown in fig .",
    "2 consistently identify the densest parts of ldn 1780 with a@xmath13 mag , represented by the red symbols ( see fig .",
    "1(top ) ) , as the region of maximum h@xmath0 intensities .",
    "such brightness contrast would not be expected , if the h@xmath0 radiation from ldn 1780 were the result of photo - ionization .",
    "if ionizing photons could penetrate via low - density paths and voids through a turbulent interstellar medium to the altitude of ldn 1780 , as suggested recently by @xcite , the resulting ionization would be limited to a thin outer shell of ldn 1780 , given its maximum visual extinction of a@xmath13 mag and its known nature as a molecular cloud with a dense core and a more diffuse outer envelope @xcite .",
    "in such a morphology , the outer , optically thin regions would appear brightest in h@xmath0 line emission , while the optically thick core regions would appear only about half as bright , as the extinction in the core would attenuate the h@xmath0 radiation from the far side .",
    "this is contrary to the observations shown in fig .",
    "1(bottom ) .",
    "the h@xmath0 morphology of ldn 1780 is indistinguishable from its appearance in the adjacent continuum , which is well understood as originating through scattering of the isrf by the dust grains in ldn 1780 @xcite .",
    "these facts strongly imply that photoionization by external lyman continuum photons is not the cause of the observed h@xmath0 light in ldn 1780 , while dust scattering of h@xmath0 photon from elsewhere in the galaxy could provide a natural explanation .",
    "the same reasoning caused @xcite to look for an ionization source other than photoionization for ldn 1780 , one that would be capable to penetrate deeply into the interior of the cloud .",
    "they suggested ionization by cosmic rays , which would be supported by a linear relation between the resulting h@xmath0 intensity and the optical depth through the cloud .",
    "in our view , they were misled into believing that there exists such a linear relation between the h@xmath0 intensity and the visual extinction through ldn 1780 by applying what we consider an inappropriate extinction correction ( their equation ( 7 ) ) .",
    "we will show in this section that the actual observed functional dependence of the h@xmath0 surface brightness on the optical depths of different cloud regions is a natural consequence of the radiative transfer of an external isrf through the interior of ldn 1780 .",
    "the actual observed scattering response of ldn 1780 to illumination by an external isrf in terms of the intensity @xmath18 as a function of the line - of - sight optical depth @xmath19 is the solution to the equation of transfer . in the range of optical depths from the optically thin limit",
    "to moderately optically thick regimes as represented by ldn 1780 , this solution has the general functional form :    @xmath20\\ ] ]    the constant @xmath21 is a product of three quantities : ( 1 ) the average intensity @xmath22 of the incident isrf ; ( 2 ) the dust albedo @xmath23 ; and ( 3 ) the phase function contribution factor @xmath24 , which measures the coupling between the anisotropic external isrf to the line of sight to the cloud through the forward - directed scattering phase function of the dust grains @xcite . rather than trying to find the solution to the actual transfer problem for ldn 1780 through modeling with all its inherent approximations and uncertainties , we will employ an empirical approach by using the well - observed scattered light intensities in our two continuum filters immediately adjacent to h@xmath0 , batc # 8 ( 607 nm ) and batc # 10 ( 705 nm ) , to provide the functional parameters for the solution to the equation of transfer .    in fig .",
    "3a we plot the averaged observed intensities @xmath25 in these two filters against the optical depth @xmath26 m ( see sect .",
    "3 ) for all observed positions on ldn 1780 .",
    "the least - squares curve fit shown corresponds to the function :    @xmath27,\\ ] ]    where the constant @xmath21 is the appropriate value for the continuum adjacent to h@xmath0 and the constant @xmath28 is the ratio of the optical depths around h@xmath0 and at 160 @xmath1 m .",
    "we find these values : @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "this lets us conclude that the maximum optical depth of ldn 1780 near h@xmath0 is @xmath31 , consistent with the maximum extinction through ldn 1780 of @xmath32 = 4.2 mag found by @xcite and the ratio of @xmath33 @xcite for milky way dust with @xmath34 .",
    "the average continuum isrf intensity in the vicinity of the sun near h@xmath0 is estimated to be @xmath35 @xcite and the dust albedo is modeled as @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "this allows us to estimate the phase function contribution factor @xmath37 .",
    "a value of @xmath24 less than unity is expected for forward - scattering grains and a scattering geometry where large - angle scattering prevails , as is the case of high - latitude clouds illuminated preferentially by sources near the galactic plane @xcite . as fig .",
    "3a shows , the isrf impinging upon ldn 1780 is clearly non - isotropic .",
    "the southern regions facing the milky way plane , represented by blue , cyan and green symbols are illuminated by a stronger radiation field , whereas the northern regions represented by the yellow symbols are illuminated by intensities that are 20% to 30% lower compared to the southern regions .    a relation identical in functional form to eq .",
    "( 2 ) should also fit the measurements of the h@xmath0 excess surface brightness , if the h@xmath0 light in ldn 1780 is a result of scattering by the same grains with the same scattering geometry as the ones that apply to the adjacent continuum .",
    "to arrive at the appropriate value for the constant @xmath21 , the first factor representing the average continuum radiation density needs to be replaced by the average h@xmath0 intensity .",
    "this is found by averaging the finkbeiner h@xmath0 map over the entire sky . @xcite and @xcite report a value for the all - sky h@xmath0 average intensity of @xmath38 .",
    "the other two factors contributing to the value of the constant a remain approximately the same as found earlier for the continuum , given that the illumination geometries for the continuum and h@xmath0 are very similar .",
    "thus , we estimate @xmath39 , if we assume that the ratio of the h@xmath0 line intensity to continuum intensity as seen by ldn 1780 is the same as found near the sun . the constant @xmath28 should be identical to that found from fig .",
    "3a , because , by design , @xmath28 refers to an effective wavelength of 656 nm , the same as h@xmath0 .",
    "we plot our h@xmath0 surface brightness measurements as a function of the optical depth @xmath40 in fig .",
    "the solid curve is the expected scattering solution for @xmath41 .",
    "it fits the h@xmath0 intensities for the northern portion of ldn 1780 rather well but fails to predict the higher intensities in the southern and central portions of the cloud . a more satisfactory solution for these portions of ldn 1780 with @xmath42 is represented by the dashed curve , which implies that the radiation field as seen by the southern side of ldn 1780 has a 38@xmath43 higher ratio of h@xmath0 to continuum intensities than the isrf near the sun .",
    "an examination of the environment of ldn 1780 on the finkbeiner h@xmath0 map reveals two giant h ii regions at galactic latitudes b @xmath44 just to the south of ldn 1780 , with maximum h@xmath0 surface brightnesses near @xmath45 .",
    "these two h ii regions are powered by the ob stars @xmath46 oph and @xmath47 sco , with approximate hipparcos - derived distances @xcite of 140 pc and 123 pc , respectively .",
    "these two h ii regions are therefore separated from ldn 1780 by only about 50 pc to 40 pc to the south , illuminating ldn 1780 under albeit rather inefficient scattering angles near 70 .",
    "the presence of these h ii regions could well explain the greater relative strength of h@xmath0 in the southern portions of ldn 1780 .",
    "considering the closeness of the fits in fig .",
    "3b , we conclude , in agreement with @xcite , that both the absolute h@xmath0 surface brightness in ldn 1780 and in particular its dependence on the optical depth through this cloud are fully consistent with dust scattering by typical interstellar grains in this cloud .",
    "these fits do not require a ten - fold locally - enhanced cosmic ray flux , nor are they consistent with the expected surface brightness distribution produced through photoionization by external lyman continuum photons .",
    "the high - latitude galactic sky is dominated by extended dust structures , which have been observed at both optical @xcite and far - infrared wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the dust morphologies in the two spectral ranges mirror each other closely @xcite , supporting the conclusion that the optical continuum intensity is due to scattering of the galactic isrf by wavelength - sized dust grains , while the far - infrared emission is due to the equilibrium thermal emission from the same dust grains , re - radiating that portion of the isrf that is absorbed by them @xcite .",
    "both the absolute and relative intensities of these two radiation phenomena are consistent with the intensity of the galactic isrf in the solar vicinity and the known scattering parameters @xcite of interstellar dust .    at high latitudes , the intensities of the optical continuum and far - infrared backgrounds",
    "are linearly related , because the respective intensities result from scattering and absorption of the same interstellar radiation field by the same population of interstellar grains , and because the high - latitude sky is optically thin at both optical and far - infrared wavelengths .",
    "however , only at blue wavelengths can the optical background be fully attributed to scattering @xcite , while the optical background at red wavelengths appears to exhibit a significant contribution from dust luminescence or extended red emission ( ere ) , as shown by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the subsequent analysis we rely only on the observed relation between the intensities at blue optical and at far - infrared wavelengths .    for optically thin cirrus clouds",

    "we justify this assumption with the fact that virtually all high - latitude cirrus dust clouds owe their large angular extent and their high latitudes to their proximity to the sun @xcite .",
    "the cloud distances , typically 100 pc to 200 pc , are small in comparison with the distances of most of the principal h@xmath0 sources at low galactic latitudes .    by applying eq .",
    "( 6 ) to the @xmath56 m iras map of @xcite , we now have a way for estimating the contribution to the high - latitude h@xmath0 background due to galactic dust scattering .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty in this prediction to be about 12@xmath43 , a combination of the estimated uncertainties in the relations shown in eqs .",

    "4a shows the resulting histogram of the numbers of @xmath17 pixels with measured total h@xmath0 intensities ( black ) , predicted scattered h@xmath0 intensities ( green ) and residual h@xmath0 intensities ( red ) attributed to in - situ recombination in the wim .",
    "the most likely value of scattered h@xmath0 intensities ( 0.1 r ) is about @xmath58 of the most frequently encountered measured total h@xmath0 intensity ( 0.52 r ) .",
    "thus , when averaged over the entire high - latitude sky , our prediction is in fair agreement with the expectations from radiative transfer models of @xcite and the recent analysis of the free - free emission and associated h@xmath0 emission from the wim by @xcite .",
    "we next analyzed a northern galactic sky region associated with extended cirrus structures , limited by galactic longitudes ( @xmath59 to @xmath60 ) and galactic latitudes ( @xmath61 to @xmath62 ) .",
    "4b shows the corresponding histograms of the frequency of the observed h@xmath0 intensities from the map of @xcite , of the predicted h@xmath0 scattered light intensities , and the residual h@xmath0 intensities that can be attributed to in - situ recombination , all without extinction corrections for this region . here",
    ", the total observed h@xmath0 intensity displays a distinct double - peaked distribution , while the predicted scattered h@xmath0 intensities peak at a higher value ( 0.16 r ) than for the high - latitude sky overall ( 0.10 r ) .",
    "we find that the removal of the scattered h@xmath0 contribution leads to a narrowing of the frequency distribution of the residual h@xmath0 intensities attributable to in - situ emission , implying smaller amplitude in the spatial structure of the in - situ emission component than previously thought @xcite , and an overall reduction in average intensity by about a factor of two .",
    "this implies that the free - free emission template for such high - latitude regions used in the wmap reductions @xcite has been overestimated in both strength and spatial structure .",
    "we suggest that the standard assumption in the reduction of cmb observations , namely that the observed h@xmath0 all - sky map of @xcite is a suitable template for free - free emission in the galactic foreground , must be reexamined , especially as it applies to high - latitude parts of the sky .",
    "in contrast to the effect of scattering , the correction for foreground extinction , using the standard approach of @xcite , of the observed h@xmath0 intensities or the h@xmath0 residual intensities after removal of the scattered component introduces relatively small changes , as illustrated in fig . 4c .",
    "the observed h@xmath0 high - latitude background before correction for scattered h@xmath0 is much more structured than the component we identify as attributable to in - situ recombination .",
    "the fwhm values of the two respective intensity frequency distributions shown in fig .",
    "4c are different by about a factor of two . fig .",
    "5 shows a map of all high - latitude parts of the sky with 1 degree resolution , where the linear , single - scattering approximation eq.(6 ) is expected to apply ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "we display the ratio of scattered h@xmath0 to total observed h@xmath0 intensities .",
    "we find many extended regions where the fraction of the scattered h@xmath0 intensity is of order 0.5 or higher , while it is much lower in other regions .",
    "specifically , at a resolution of 1 degree , we find for the unmasked areas , representing @xmath63 of the entire sky , that @xmath64 exhibits a ratio of scattered - to - total h@xmath0 of @xmath65 , 38.7% of the region falls into the range 0.25 - 0.50 , @xmath66 reaches values of 0.5 - 0.75 , with only @xmath67 exceeding the value of 0.75 .",
    "the last category increases in coverage about fourfold when the pixel size is changed from 1 degree to 6 , with a corresponding decrease in the second interval ( 0.25 to 0.50 ) .",
    "this emphasizes the fact that the scattered h@xmath0 contribution adds particularly to the small - scale structure of the h@xmath0 background .",
    "the estimate by @xcite , suggesting that between 5% and 20% of the all - sky h@xmath0 background may be attributable to scattering by dust appears to be in good agreement with our estimates for about half of the high - latitude sky , especially if lower latitudes are included ( fig .",
    "4a ) , but the authors failed to account for the highly structured distribution in the ratio of h@xmath0 scattering to h@xmath0 in - situ emission ( fig .",
    "4b ) in their model .",
    "it is precisely this structure that is important in attempts to determine the small - scale anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background at angular scales of @xmath68 1 degree .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "5 are the published positions where wham measurements of the [ s ii]/h@xmath0 line intensity ratio have been obtained by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it appears , the selection criteria applied to these observations have resulted in a somewhat biased data set in the sense that the chosen directions fall either very close to the galactic plane or predominantly in high - latitude regions where we identify the scattered h@xmath0 contribution to be very small .",
    "we averaged the ratios of the scattered to total h@xmath0 intensities predicted by eq .",
    "( 6 ) for all those individual pointings shown as small open circles falling outside the masked area in fig .",
    "5 , with a resulting average of of scattered - to - total h@xmath0 of 0.14 . also shown with a cyan outline",
    "is a continuous region surveyed by @xcite . in fig .",
    "6 we show the line emission ratios [ s ii]/h@xmath0 as a function of the predicted ratio of scattered - to - total h@xmath0 for those pointings within this region that fall outside the near - plane masked area . for comparison , we also entered the corresponding values for the excess emission in ldn 1780 , based on our recent wham measurements .",
    "while the data from the @xcite survey appear to represent to a large extent a typical wim environment with little scattering and significantly enhanced [ s ii]/h@xmath0 ratios compared to those seen in h ii regions , this comparison shows ldn 1780 to be clearly distinct from the wim , with an emission line ratio similar to that of h ii regions.this is an independent indication that the h@xmath0 excess in ldn 1780 is a result of scattering .",
    "note that the total ratio of scattered - to - total h@xmath0 emission toward ldn 1780 is about 0.65 , reflecting the fact that in addition to the h@xmath0 excess in ldn 1780 analyzed in this paper , additional h@xmath0 intensity of both scattering and recombination origin is seen in the direction of ldn1780 .",
    "it is our conclusion that the ratio of scattered to total h@xmath0 background across the high - latitude sky is highly variable and that this could be demonstrated by conducting an unbiased survey of the [ s  ii]/h@xmath0 line intensity ratio .",
    "while our results may lead to a reduction in the h@xmath0 intensities attributable to in - situ emission in the wim , they do not eliminate in - situ emission in the wim as a real phenomenon requiring further study ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "after completion of this work a paper by seon et al .",
    "( arxiv:1006.4419 ) became available , dealing with the analysis of the far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) continuum background observed by spear / fims .",
    "the latitude - dependent fuv background is consistent with scattering by interstellar dust . at galactic latitudes @xmath69",
    "these authors find a close linear correlation between the diffuse h@xmath0 background taken from the finkbeiner map and their fuv background intensities .",
    "the most likely interpretation of this result is that the high - latitude h@xmath0 background is significantly affected by its dust - scattered component .",
    "* we confirm the prediction of @xcite and the findings of @xcite that the excess surface brightness in h@xmath0 light of ldn 1780 , and by extension in other high - latitude dust structures @xcite , is due to scattering of h@xmath0 photons present in the galactic isrf , having originated in emission regions elsewhere . *",
    "our determination of the line - to - continuum ratio of the scattered light in ldn 1780 , when combined with earlier work relating the optical continuum intensity to the 100  @xmath1 m surface brightness of optically thin high - latitude clouds , allows us to predict the intensity of the expected scattered h@xmath0 intensity for large fractions of the high - latitude galactic sky .",
    "* we find the ratio of scattered to total observed h@xmath0 intensities for many regions dominated by galactic cirrus dust to be of the order of 0.5 , higher than predicted by @xcite , but with considerable small - scale structure and spatial variation . * the standard assumption in the reduction of cmb observations , namely that the observed h@xmath0 all - sky map of @xcite is a suitable template for free - free emission in the galactic foreground ,",
