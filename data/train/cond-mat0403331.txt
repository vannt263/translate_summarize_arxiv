    "gapped spin systems in high magnetic field have attracted much attention recently , both from the theoretical and experimental side . in absence of the field",
    "the system is supposed to have a singlet ground state and a finite gap @xmath1 to the lowest excitation , typically in the triplet sector . when the field is increased beyond the critical value @xmath2 necessary to close the gap , the ground state acquires a finite magnetization , and a number of new phenomena",
    "can appear , including critical phases , field - induced ordering , magnetization plateaux , etc .",
    "the system behavior at @xmath3 depends strongly on the symmetry properties and dimensionality .",
    "generally , if there is no axial symmetry with respect to the field direction , the high - field phase always exhibits a tranverse staggered long - range order ( lro ) perpendicular to the applied field , independently on the system dimensionality , and is characterized by a finite spectral gap .",
    "if the axial symmetry is present , it can not be spontaneously broken in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) system .",
    "the high - field phase is in this case characterized by quasi - lro ( power - law correlations ) , and its lowest excitations are determined by the spinon continuum .    in the 3d case ,",
    "@xmath4 symmetry gets spontaneously broken and the high - field phase is ordered but possesses a gapless ( goldstone ) mode . if one views the process of formation of the high - field phase as accumulation of hardcore bosonic particles ( magnons ) in the ground state , the ordering transition at @xmath5 can be interpreted as the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of magnons .",
    "the idea of field - induced bec was discussed theoretically many times .",
    "@xcite the best available realisation of such a transition was observed @xcite in @xmath6 , which can be viewed as a system of coupled @xmath7 dimers .",
    "the temperature dependence of the uniform magnetization was found @xcite to agree qualitatively with the bec theory predictions .",
    "high - frequency magnetic resonance measurements @xcite have demonstrated directly the field dependence of the energy gap , but were limited to the fields @xmath8 and a few number of microwave frequencies .",
    "the response in the high - field ordered phase of @xmath0 was measured in the inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) experiments of regg et al . ; @xcite the behavior of the lowest triplet gaps as functions of field was successfully described within the bond - operator mean - field theory.@xcite in those ins measurements only two triplet modes were observed above @xmath2 , and the gap of the third mode was concluded to be zero within the experimental resolution ; however , the low - energy range could not be studied in this experiment because of the strong field - induced magnetic bragg contamination below @xmath9  mev ( @xmath10  ghz ) .",
    "very recently , high - field electron spin resonance experiments on @xmath0 in a wide range of fields up to @xmath11  koe were conducted , @xcite which revealed a reopening of the gap above @xmath2 in the low - energy range inaccessible by means of ins .",
    "a natural explanation would be the existence of some anisotropic interactions explicitly breaking the @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "the aim of the present work is to show that the available data can indeed be described on a _ quantitative _ level , assuming presence of a weak exchange anisotropy in both intra- and interdimer interactions .",
    "the crystals of tlcucl@xmath12 have monoclinic symmetry , with crystallographic axes @xmath13 and",
    "@xmath14 forming an angle of 96.32@xmath15 , @xmath16 being the twofold axis . the sample growth is described in detail in ref .. esr spectra were taken at temperature @xmath17  k , in the field range from @xmath18 to @xmath11  koe , using a set of home - made microwave spectrometers with transmission type cavities and a superconducting magnet .",
    "single crystals with the volume of @xmath19mm@xmath20 were used . during the experiments crystals",
    "were mounted in the following orientations with respect to the magnetic field : @xmath21 $ ] ( i.e. , parallel to the @xmath16 axis ) , @xmath22 and @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "the @xmath24 $ ] direction forms an angle of @xmath25 with the @xmath13 axis , see fig.[fig : axes ] .",
    "the detailed description of the esr spectra is reported in ref .   and here we will just summarize the results .",
    "the esr signal corresponding to the transitions from the ground state to the lowest @xmath26 excited state is clearly visible both below and above the critical field . for @xmath27 ,",
    "such transitions would be forbidden for an ideal isotropic system .",
    "the main feature of this signal is reopening of the gap above the critical field , which can be directly observed for all three mutually perpendicular field directions . besides the ground state transitions",
    ", transitions between zeeman - split components of the thermally activated triplet were observed below the critical field .",
    "the analysis of the field dependence of thermally activated transitions at @xmath27 has also suggested presence of a finite zero - field splitting of the triplet.@xcite",
    "the dynamics of a 3d coupled anisotropic @xmath7 dimer system in a wide range of fields can be described within the effective field theory @xcite which may be viewed as a continuum version of the bond boson approach.@xcite it is based on introducing dimer coherent states @xcite @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 are the singlet and three triplet states,@xcite and @xmath31 , @xmath32 are real vectors related to the magnetization @xmath33 and sublattice magnetization @xmath34 of the spin dimer : @xmath35     schematic picture of the anisotropy axes in @xmath0.,width=188 ]    in @xmath0 , there are two types of chains of spin dimers running along the crystallographic @xmath13 axis . in the high - field phase the staggered order @xmath36 alternates between the two different types of chains .",
    "@xcite the magnetization @xmath37 should be uniform , which leads us to the following ansatz : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the radius - vector labeling the dimers , and the vectors @xmath40 are in the following way connected to the lattice vectors @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 : @xmath44    the topology of exchange paths in @xmath0 is known rather well .",
    "@xcite we assume additionally a weak orthorhombic anisotropy ( the simplest type compatible with the crystal symmetry ) in intra- as well as in interdimer exchange,@xcite so that instead of one intradimer exchange constant @xmath45 one has a vector @xmath46 , etc .",
    "each dimer has an inversion center , which excludes the intradimer dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction ( but it remains possible between the dimers ) ; for simplicity , we neglect the dm interaction in the present treatment .    passing to the continuum , one obtains the lagrangian @xmath47^{2 } \\\\ & -&\\sum_{i}\\ { m_{i}\\varphi_{i}^{2 } + \\widetilde{m}_{i}\\eta_{i}^{2 } \\ } + 2{\\bm{h}}\\cdot({\\bm{\\varphi}}\\times{\\bm{\\eta } } ) -v({\\bm{\\varphi}},{\\bm{\\eta}}),\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 and @xmath49 ; we denote @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the gyromagnetic tensor and @xmath52 is the magnetic field .",
    "effective interdimer couplings @xmath53 are in the following way connected with the microscopic couplings ( the notation of ref .",
    "is used ) : @xmath54    we will assume that we are not too far above the critical field , so that the magnitude of the triplet component is small , i.e. , @xmath55 .",
    "then , retaining only the fourth - order terms in the interaction @xmath56 in ( [ leff ] ) , one obtains @xmath57 where @xmath58 is given by a different combination of couplings , @xmath59    the further derivation is similar to that given in ref .. integrating out the field @xmath60 results in the relation @xmath61 and yields the effective lagrangian depending on @xmath62 only : @xmath63^{2 } \\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\sum_{i}2{\\hbar\\over \\widetilde{m}_{i } } ( { \\bm{h}}\\times{\\bm{\\varphi}})_{i } \\partial_{t } \\varphi_{i } -u_{2}({\\bm{\\varphi } } )    -u_{4}({\\bm{\\varphi}},\\partial_{t}{\\bm{\\varphi}}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the quadratic and quartic interaction given by @xmath64 we analyze the obtained field theory at the mean - field ( zero - loop ) level ; this is formally justified for weak interdimer coupling , while in @xmath0 @xmath53 and @xmath65 are of the same order . however , a similar approximation is used in the bond - boson approach which successfully describes the ins data on the magnon dispersion in this material.@xcite as we will see later , this simplified treatment yields reasonable results in the present case as well .    the staggered order parameter @xmath66 ( static value of @xmath62 ) is zero below @xmath2 , and above the critical field it is determined as the nontrivial solution of the equations @xmath67 where the matrices @xmath68 , @xmath69 are defined as @xmath70    linearizing the theory around @xmath71 , one finds the magnon energies @xmath72 depending on the field @xmath52 and the wave vector @xmath73 as real roots of the secular equation @xmath74 where @xmath75 and the matrix @xmath76 is given by @xmath77 the antisymmetric matrix @xmath78 can be written as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is defined as follows : @xmath81    to proceed , one has to fix the principal anisotropy axes . as suggested in ref .",
    ", for symmetry reasons one of them should coincide with the crystallographic @xmath16 axis ; this axis we will denote @xmath82 .",
