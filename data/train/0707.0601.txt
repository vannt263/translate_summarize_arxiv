    "the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) created in relativistic heavy ion collisions at rhic is believed to be strongly coupled @xcite .",

    "the transport results bear some relevance to the qgp plasma at rhic .",
    "much less is known about the time - dependent evolution of the strongly coupled plasma .",
    "there have been suggestions that the fireball in relativistic heavy ion collision ( rhic ) can be explained from a dual gravity point of view  @xcite .    in order to model the expanding plasma in a gravity set up",
    ", the use of a moving black hole was suggested in  @xcite . in @xcite ( hereon",
    "refer to as jp ) , it was shown that the moving horizon black hole geometry can be generated by assuming an asymptotycally expanding perfect fluid in a boost invariant setting . using conformal invariance and energy - momentum conservation together with holographic renormalization @xcite , jp constructed the bulk geometry from the perfect fluid boundary data .",
    "this metric was extended to the case of shear viscosity @xcite , r - charge @xcite and to a 3 dimensional non - isotropic setting @xcite . an exact background with isotropic expansion",
    "was worked out in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the diffusion of a non - relativistic heavy quarks in one dimensionally expanding plasma using the jp metric .",
    "heavy quark diffusion have been studied in a static black hole background in various ways @xcite . here ,",
    "we follow the suggestion in @xcite in the static case , by analyzing the momentum fluctuations of a heavy quark in an expanding plasma , and use it to estimate the drag force and diffusion rate .",
    "we will use a generalized langevin equation to assess the diffusion rate .",
    "unlike @xcite we suggest that the green function of string fluctuation should be identified with the correlator of the fluctuation force rather than the total force in a langevin approach .",
    "the basic object of this procedure is the gauge - invariant electric - electric force decorrelation , which we will calculate using the ads / cft duality .",
    "the field theory dual ( operator ) to a quark displacement(@xmath15 ) is the ( gauge invariant ) colored force acting on a heavy quark @xcite .",
    "according to the ads / cft correspondence the generating function in field theory should be related with the classical action by ( if(t)(t ) ) = ( is_cl [ ] )  , whose second derivative gives us the symmetrized wightman function @xmath16 it is related to the retarded green s function  @xcite @xmath17 in momentum space .",
    "we will calculate @xmath18 from the nambu - goto action of the fluctuating string in the jp metric following the way proposed in @xcite ( section 2 ) .",
    "we note that this decorrelator applies both to heavy and light fundamental quarks , therefore the decorrelation time is a measure of how the gluon rescattering against external fundamental probes decorrelate .    in section 2",
    "we start with the jp metric in @xcite and derive equations of motion of the transverse string fluctuation of a heavy quark .",
    "we also calculate the retarded green s function , which is translated to an electric force - force correlator ( or more precisely decorrelator ) in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "we compute the momentum fluctuation(broadening ) of a heavy quark . by arguing that a generalized langevin equation applies for the case , we deduce the heavy quark diffusion property in the expanding and cooling plasma .",
    "our conclusions are in section 5 .",
    "we consider a heavy particle moving in an expanding plasma .",

    "@xmath22 o r @xmath3 , the force decorrelation can be treated as instantaneous .",
    "thus , the velocity decorrelation of a heavy quark in a strongly coupled plasma can be followed generically by a langevin description . for an expanding plasma",
    "the description involves a generalized langevin of the form    + ( t)p(t)=f(t ) , with both the drag coefficient @xmath23 and the diffusion constant @xmath24 time dependent .",
    "the idea here is that the force - force decorrelator can be calculated from the microscopic physics and the drag coefficient @xmath23 is related to the force - force decorrelator by a non - equilibrium relation @xcite .    for the drag coefficient",
    ", we need to calculate the correlators in a frame which moves with the particle .",
    "so it is enough to consider a particle moving with the expanding plasma . for a one dimensional expansion ,",
    "such a comoving frame was introduced by hwa @xcite and by bjorken @xcite in terms of the rapidity @xmath25 and the proper time @xmath26 of the comoving coordinate system . @xmath26 and @xmath25 are related to the time coordinate @xmath27 , and logitudinal coordinate @xmath28 , through @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",

    "we remark that the solution is valid only for late times ( asymptotic solution ) .",
    "the metric ( [ metric.0 ] ) is written in fefferman - graham coordinate @xmath34 .",
    "it is useful to express it in a more canonical form , that will prove usefull for a paralell calculation with the static case . indeed , by introducing the coordinate change @xmath39 the metric ( [ metric.0 ] )",

    "while this approximation blurs the rigor of the arguments to follow , it should nevertheless provide us with an insightful understanding of the time scale involved in the relaxation of the diffusion process .",
