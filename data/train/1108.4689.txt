    "( [ miracle ] ) goes a long way toward providing an attractive dark matter scenario , it is , of course , not sufficient . to realize the wimpless scenario fully , the dark matter candidate must also ( 1 ) be stable on cosmological time scales and ( 2 ) annihilate to light particles ,",

    "in addition , the model must also satisfy basic constraints , such as vacuum stability and perturbativity , and the dark matter s properties must be consistent with all experimental and observational constraints .",
    "these are not trivial constraints in the context of amsb models , in which all superpartner masses are determined by a small number of low - energy parameters .",

    "as mentioned before , once @xmath153 is fixed , @xmath94 is determined for every point on the @xmath155 plane .",
    "we may then use eq .",
    "( [ perturbativity ] ) to check whether such a point satisfies the requirement of perturbativity .",
    "the region excluded by this requirement is indicated in fig .  [",
    "fig : mgravitinoxi1 ] . from this",
    "we conclude that if @xmath157 , the model predicts that @xmath154 lies in the range @xmath200 .",
    "such a prediction will definitely be tested in the near future , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : gstar ] .",
    "in this work , we have constructed an extremely simple model of dark matter in amsb with a hidden sector . the hidden sector is sqed with @xmath0 degenerate flavors of leptons and sleptons . through a combination of electric charge , lepton flavor , and @xmath35-parity conservation ,",
    "all @xmath0 flavors of leptons and sleptons are stable and contribute to cold dark matter . as in the case of wimps , the thermal relic density of these particles is directly related to the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking and is naturally of the right order of magnitude to be dark matter .",
    "in contrast to wimps , however , the dark matter has a mass that may be anywhere from @xmath194 to 10 tev , and it also has interesting astrophysical implications that are absent for wimps . in particular , it self - interacts through coulomb interactions , and the massless hidden photon implies extra relativistic degrees of freedom in the range @xmath201 , with significant deviations from 0 possible in the simplest models with low @xmath202 . if the hidden and visible sectors were in thermal contact in the very early universe , @xmath121 is more constrained and is predicted to assume values in the range @xmath203 .",
    "such predictions are especially interesting , given that data already taken by planck may provide evidence of such deviations .",
    "as dark matter in this model consists of hidden particles , the visible sector is relieved of the duty of providing dark matter .",
    "this is a welcome possibility , as the most natural dark matter candidate in amsb , the neutral wino , has a thermal relic density that is typically too small to be all of dark matter by several orders of magnitude .",
    "@xmath35-parity may also be broken in the visible sector , provided constraints from proton decay and elsewhere are not violated , with implications for collider searches .    in this work ,",
    "we have introduced @xmath32 , a supersymmetric mass for the hidden sleptons , and treated it as a free parameter .",
    "this is a time - honored approach and has yielded interesting results .",
    "that said , just as a complete neutralino wimp scenario requires a solution to the @xmath32 problem in the visible sector , a complete wimpless scenario requires a concrete @xmath32-term mechanism in the hidden sector .",
    "formally , to realize the wimpless miracle with a relic density that is independent of @xmath13 , the @xmath32 parameter must have the form @xmath204 .",
    "of course , we have found that constraints from dark matter self - interactions require @xmath205 , and so a @xmath32-term of the form @xmath206 , while parametrically incorrect , will yield phenomenologically viable numerical values for @xmath32 .",
    "there are several proposed mechanisms for generating @xmath32-terms in the visible sector of amsb models ; see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite . in these mechanisms ,",
    "the form of @xmath32 is typically @xmath207 , where @xmath208 is a function of new yukawa couplings . for @xmath209 ,",
    "these mechanisms solve the @xmath32 problem in the mssm , and similar mechanisms in the hidden sector would provide numerically correct @xmath32-terms for this model of wimpless dark matter .",
    "it would be more satisfying , however , to find @xmath32-term mechanisms that provide the parametrically correct form @xmath210 .",
    "this is beyond the scope of this work , but we note that , in contrast to the traditional @xmath32 problem of the visible sector , which requires both @xmath211 and @xmath212 , in the hidden sector , the constraints on @xmath40 are less stringent , which may open new avenues for @xmath32-term generation .    finally , we note that we have made several assumptions in the interest of simplicity .",
    "more general models with non - universal charges @xmath213 , non - universal @xmath32-terms , or non - vanishing @xmath40-terms may have interesting features .",
    "in addition , we have assumed that there are no interactions between the visible and hidden sector , which eliminates direct and indirect dark matter signals .",
    "one could introduce connector particles with both visible and hidden sector charges to induce such signals .",
    "a special motivation for introducing such interactions is that , as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : selfinteractions ] , this framework provides the possibility of dark matter particles with a naturally correct thermal relic density , but masses @xmath214 , that is , at the scale indicated by current direct detection anomalies .",
    "such connector particles would also induce mixing between the hidden and visible photons , with a host of possible implications .",
