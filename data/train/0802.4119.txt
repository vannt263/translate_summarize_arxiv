    "further observations by siebenmorgen , krgel , & spoon ( 2004 ) with a resolution of @xmath3 0@xmath15 were unable to directly resolve the nucleus at 10.4@xmath0 , but showed that the growth curve indicated weak extended emission over 2@xmath9 with a surface brightness a factor of ten lower than the peak of the nucleus .",
    "most recently , observations by hardcastle , kraft , and worrall ( 2006 ) ( herein hkw06 ) find the nuclear fwhm of cen a to be slightly resolved calculating a conservative upper limit of 0@xmath127 or @xmath10 4.6pc at n - band ( @xmath11@xmath12 = 10.4@xmath0 ) .",
    "if the nucleus of cen a is resolved , this could be the first galaxy in which the emission from dust associated with the torus has been resolved with single - telescope mid - ir observations . in order to address the controversy of the central nuclear resolution of cen a , we have methodically observed cen a and corresponding calibration sources at high - resolution in the mid - ir to ( 1 ) test the hypothesis that the nucleus is resolved and ( 2 ) characterize the mid - ir emission mechanisms .",
    "in addition , we draw upon publicly accessible archived observations in the mid - ir in addition to our own data to further explore low - level extended emission surrounding the nucleus of cen a. our observations are discussed in @xmath13 2 while results and analysis are presented in @xmath13 3 and @xmath13 4 respectively . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a distance to cen a of d= 3.5 mpc ( 1@xmath9=17pc ) .",
    "observations of cen a were made over two epochs .",
    "epoch a occurred on 2004 january 28 and 29 ( ut ) and was initiated by the authors of this paper .",

    "this resulted in a total of 5 psf observations ( 5.4 min on - source total ) and 5 galaxy observations ( 34 min on - source total ) .",
    "we used the same procedure on the second night at 18.3@xmath0 ; however , the initial psf star had too low a s / n ratio so a new psf was chosen resulting in only 3 high s / n psf measurements ( 3.3 min on - source total ) .",
    "a total of 4 galaxy observations ( 26.4 min on - source total ) at 18.3@xmath0 were obtained .",

    "the differences in the intrinsic spectra of the stellar sources and cen a as observed through the si-2 and qa filters requires a color correction .",

    "the difference between a t@xmath34000k and t@xmath3200k source in the n - band will result in a color correction of the observed flux density up to 21% and the observed fwhm of the stellar source will appear 12% smaller . due to the relatively small bandwith of the si-2 and qa filters",

    "the overall decrease in fwhm in the 8.8@xmath0 plot corresponds to the lower airmass through the observations as well as an improvement in seeing throughout the night .",

    "neither the extension claimed by k03 nor by hkw06 is detected . in the case of k03",
    "it was noted that several hours passed between galaxy and psf observations while hkw06 compared individual galaxy exposures of 825 sec on - source with a single short 43 sec on - source observation of the psf .",
    "as can be seen in figure 1 , the psf and galaxy vary significantly over time with changes in seeing and airmass , highlighting the potential dangers in comparing a single , short psf measurement to a set of longer galaxy observations .",
    "we agree with the observations of whysong & antonucci ( 2004 ) that the nucleus of cen a is unresolved , though with multiple psf observations we are able to place a tighter statistical constraint of the size of the bright mid - ir nucleus . following the analysis of soifer et al .",

    "we modeled a range of torus parameters , which include the radial distribution , @xmath47 , the optical depth per cloud measured in the @xmath48 band , @xmath49 , and the total number of clouds through the equatorial plane , @xmath50 .",
    "we show the results for a model that fits the observed 10@xmath0 nuclear spectrum of ngc 1068 well ( mason et al .",
    "2006 ) , with @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and a comparison model in which @xmath43 and @xmath53 . in both models , @xmath54 ,",
    "the outer radius is 30 times the dust sublimation radius , and the cloud distribution is gaussian in elevation above the torus mid - plane , without a sharp cutoff .",
    "these two sets of parameters yield cloud distributions and images that are characteristic of the full parameter space we explored .    the torus is viewed edge - on in the simulated images at 8.8 and 18.3@xmath0 ( figure 6 ) .",
    "the 18.3@xmath0 emission generally traces the cloud distribution because optical depth effects are not significant , both for heating the clouds and their subsequent emission .",
    "directly - heated clouds that are not blocked along the line of sight dominate the emission at 8.8@xmath0 .",
    "the resulting images are extended perpendicular to the cloud distribution , and in the less compact ( @xmath55 ) distribution , this extension persists on larger scales .",
    "the exact emission profile does depend on the model parameters , but in all cases the strong extended emission ( which the fwhm of the simulated images themselves indicates ) is confined to scales of @xmath56 . in the simulations ,",
    "the flux declines to 10% of the peak strength on scales of @xmath57 or less . in general",
    ", the emission is more compact in the steeper cloud distributions , and it is always much smaller than the @xmath58 upper limit we measure in the data .",
    "this approaches the scales of hst stis observations of marconi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) which indicate the central dark object in cen a is no more than 0@xmath1036 - 0@xmath104 ( 0.6 - 0.7pc ) in radius .",
    "thus , careful interferometry will be required to resolve this structure .",
    "as in the case of m87 ( perlman et al . 2001 ) , the powerful radio jet of cen a could provide a significant fraction of the mid - ir emission through synchrotron radiation .",
    "chiaberge et al .",
    "( 2001 ) claim the entire nuclear sed of cen a can be fit with a synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model .",
    "also recent mid - ir interferometry models by meisenheimer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggest a tiny predominantly ssc core ( @xmath170.2pc ) .",
    "they model that the ssc core contributes between 80 - 60% of the emission between 8 and 13 @xmath0 respectively .",
    "however there are several problems with this scenario .",
    "first , the lack of polarization at @xmath3 1000@xmath0 ( packham et al .",
    "1996 ) is difficult to reconcile with a predominantly synchrotron core .",
    "second , meisenheimer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) reference the variability seen at l - band ( @xmath33.5@xmath0 ) by lepine et al .",
    "( 1984 ) detailing an increase in flux by a factor of 5 between 1971 - 1981 as evidence of the variable synchrotron nature of the ir core .",
    "if the mid - ir core is dominated by synchrotron emission then similar variability should be seen at @xmath3 10@xmath0 .",
    "however mid - ir ( 10@xmath0 ) measurements taken coincident with the l - band observations ( becklin et al .",
    "1971 , kleinmann et al . 1974 ,",
    "grasdalen et al . 1976 ) seem inconsistent with variability trends seen at x - ray and radio wavelengths ( beall et al .",
    "1978 ; abraham et al .",
    "indeed telesco ( 1978 ) comparing mid - ir ( 10@xmath0 ) observations from 1971 - 1978 concluded that there was no evidence of mid - ir variability during this period . comparing mid - ir observations taken from 1984 to 2004 also show no significant variation at @xmath310@xmath0 after accounting for filter and calibration differences ( alexander et al .",
    "1999 ; mirabel et al .",
    "1999 ; krabbe et al .",

    "2005 ; hardcastle et al .",
    "2006 ; this paper ) . and finally , the fluxes measured by meisenheimer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for the ssc core at 11.4@xmath0 are a factor of @xmath3 4 smaller that the unresolved core measured by whysong & antonucci ( 2004 ) at 11.7@xmath0 . given that the high spatial resolution siebenmorgen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) spectra show no pah emission it is unlikely that this could affect the flux .",
    "thus at least at the longer portion of the 10@xmath0 window it appears that there is ample excess emission possibly from a torus that could dominate the mid - ir on scales @xmath17 0@xmath13 .",
    "another method to estimate the synchrotron emission in the nucleus of cen a is to use a simple power law model such as that used for m87 ( perlman et al .",
    "2001 ) . a strong linear correlation between the optical and radio core values of fr i galaxies found by chiaberge , capetti , and celotti ( 1999 ) hinted at a common synchrotron origin for this emission .",
    "capetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) used this correlation and the radio core flux of cen a of 9.1 jy at 15ghz ( clarke , burns , & norman 1992 ) to predict the synchrotron emission at 2@xmath0 of 10mjy .",
    "this trend also follows closely with the synchrotron models of hkw06 which fit the non - nuclear  inner \" ,  middle \" and  outer \" lobes of the radio jet in cen a. assuming this trend and a radio core flux of 9.1jy we predict a nonthermal mid - ir flux density between 8 and 18@xmath0 of 30 to 50mjy ; more than an order of magnitude less than what is measured .",
    "this may indicate that synchrotron emission in the nucleus of cen a is negligible in the mid - ir in comparison to emission from dust .",
    "the nucleus of cen a is most likely dominated by the agn , however much of the surrounding extended emission is likely due to stars . the close correspondence between much of this emission @xmath595@xmath9 from the nucleus at 8.8@xmath0 and n - band and the pa-@xmath2 data from marconi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ( figures 3 and 4 ) indicate much of what we are seeing is associated with regions of star formation .",
    "the same has been seen in other extragalactic star forming regions by alonso - herrero et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . in general , these clumps as well as much of the emission",
    "outline the twin parallel lanes of emission seen as part of the large scale warped disk in the lower resolution spitzer mid - ir data ( quillen et al .",
    "2006 ; figure 1 ) . at 8.8@xmath0 and n - band the pa-@xmath2 clumps",
    "c , d , e , f , and g seen by schreier et al .",
    "( 1998 ) are all detected along the direction of the top lane of emission seen by spitzer .",
    "along the bottom lane only the pa-@xmath2 clump k is detected .",
    "several other mid - ir sources of emission associated with regions of pa-@xmath2 emission are also obvious in figures 3 and 4 . at 18.3@xmath0 little evidence of this emission",
    "this is most likely due to two reasons : ( 1 ) the lower sensitivity of the 18@xmath0 ( qa ) filter and ( 2 ) star formation regions typically have a pah component at 8.6@xmath0 and 11.3@xmath0 which is readily detected in the 8.8@xmath0 and n - band filters .",
    "however , at both 8.8@xmath0 and n - band some pa-@xmath2 clumps are devoid of mid - ir emission .",
    "unfortunately this may be due to the limited chop throw ( 15@xmath9 ) of the data discussed previously which is certainly chopping onto other regions of low level emission creating negative areas in the field of view .",
    "thus extensive analysis of theses star formation regions is not feasible at this time .",
    "however , there is an overall good correspondence between the pa-@xmath2 and mid - ir .      although the nucleus can be heated entirely by the agn it is unlikely that the bulk of the extended emission could be heated by the central engine .",
    "this low level - extended mid - ir emission , in some cases up to 10@xmath9 ( 170pc ) away from the nucleus would have to be extremely cool on order of @xmath3 60k assuming the same simple formula as in @xmath13 4.1.2 . assuming a normal blackbody sed of dust this cool however would cause significant emission ( on order of a few jy ) at longer wavelengths such as 18.3@xmath0 where no significant extended emission is seen on scales @xmath283@xmath9 .",
    "this provides further evidence that much of this mid - ir emission , especially that coincident with the pa-@xmath2 emission , is associated with local stellar activity .",
    "the only significant 18.3@xmath0 emission detected is a small clump of emission at a distance of 2.8@xmath9 ( 48pc ) from the nucleus ( pa=64@xmath4 ; measured north through east ) approximately coincident with pa-@xmath2 clump a from schreier et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "krajnovi , sharp , & thatte ( 2006 ) suggest this clump as well as clump b may be due to jet induced star formation . emission is detected in both clumps at 8.8@xmath0 while there is a @xmath32@xmath19 detection of clump b at 18.3@xmath0 .",
    "if this mid - ir emission is truly associated with shock induced star formation regions then we would expect heating of the surrounding dust to be local .",
    "we measure the the flux density in a 2@xmath9 diameter area near clump a to be @xmath3 4mjy at 8.8@xmath0 and @xmath3 40mjy at 18@xmath0 , given the possibility of emission being chopped onto these can be considered rough estimates . near clump b",
    "the mid - ir emission is similar to that of clump a @xmath3 4mjy at 8.8@xmath0 with very little emission ( @xmath3 17mjy ) at 18.3@xmath0 .",
    "this results in an optically thin estimate of the temperature of 150 - 200k near clump a and even warmer near clump b which is farther away at 3.5@xmath9 ( 60pc ) .",
    "given that we estimate that 14pc is approximately the maximum distance that the agn ( 2.5 @xmath5 10@xmath34 l@xmath7 ) can heat dust to 200k this would rule out mid - ir emission near clump b as being centrally heated dust .",
    "even for clump a at a temperature of 150k only the smallest grains of graphite ( 0.003 - 0.005um ) could be heated by the central engine .",
    "though these are very simple estimates it does imply that local heating of dust due to shock induced star formation associated with the radio ejecta is a possible explanation for mid - ir emission near clumps a and b. however , if there is an enhancement in luminosity in the direction of the nlr along the radio axis ( ne of the nucleus ) , as would be the case if the ionizing luminosity is anisotropic , then it may be possible to heat dust out to a radius consistent with clumps a and b. this could also explain the faint mid - ir extension seen on the opposite side ( sw of the nucleus ) at 8.8@xmath0 .",
    "this is thought to be the case in ngc 4151 ( radomski et al .",
    "2003 ) where extended mid - ir emission on either side of the nucleus along the radio axis is thought to arise from a dusty nlr within the ionization cone heated by the central engine . in this case",
    "the nlr of ngc 4151 may see an ionizing luminosity a factor of @xmath313@xmath5 greater than that seen from earth ( penston et al .",
    "anisotropies and beaming along the nlr has been predicted as strong as 200@xmath5 in some galaxies ( baldwin , wilson & whittle 1987 ) . in cen a a beaming factor or underestimate of the true luminosity of 10 - 20@xmath5 would be needed to be consistent with the central heating of clumps a and b within an ionization cone .",
    "co and h@xmath60 measurements of cen a show a nuclear ring of outer radius 80 - 140pc , with an inner hole of diameter 40pc enclosing a mass of 10@xmath34 l@xmath7 ( israel et al 1990 , 1991 ; rydbeck et al . 1993 ; marconi et al .",
    "this ring is aligned perpendicular to the radio jet and has been speculated to be associated with the very outer parts of a torus .",
    "this would seem to contradict our earlier results which indicate a highly compact torus @xmath173.5pc .",
    "the difference however is entirely due to what is defined as the  torus \" in agn .",
    "shi et al . ( 2006 ) describes the  torus \" as a multilayered system with and  inner \" ( @xmath170.1pc )  middle \" ( 0.1 - 10pc ) and  outer \" ( 10 - 300pc ) structure . in this scenario",
    "the compact torii seen in the mid - ir would typically correspond to the  middle \" disk while the co / h@xmath60 is associated with the  outer \" disk .",
    "similar to cen a , ngc 1068 also contains a compact mid - ir torus @xmath1715pc ( mason et al .",
    "2006 ) surrounded by a large 100pc scale co disk .",
    "mid - ir polarization observations of ngc 1068 by packham et al .",
    "( 2007 ) provide continuity between these structures suggesting that the compact geometrically and optically thick torus is often surrounded by a larger and more diffuse structure associated with the dusty central regions of the host galaxy .",
    "other dusty structures such as nuclear galactic bars may further merge into this scenario .",
    "observations by marconi et al .",
    "( 2001b ) even suggest that the h@xmath60 structure shows kinematical evidence consistent with a galactic bar fueling the agn , though they can not entirely rule out a disk / torus structure .",
    "possible evidence for mid - ir emission associated with this  outer \" torus / nuclear bar can be seen at both 8.8@xmath0 and n - band ( figures 3 and 4 ) . at both wavelengths there",
    "appears to be a ridge of emission extending up from the nw of the nucleus towards pa-@xmath2 clump g. at 8.8@xmath0 some mid - ir emission is also seen on the se side . in all cases",
    "this emission seems devoid of corresponding pa-@xmath2 emission associated with stellar activity as discussed earlier . given that the data at 8.8um and n - band is chopping on different areas of the galaxy ( see observations @xmath13 2 )",
    "it is unlikely that at least the nw structure seen at both wavelengths is excessively distorted due to improper chop subtraction .",
    "this structure possibly indicates that the emission detected in co / h@xmath60 contains a dusty component .",
    "however , using simple calculations from @xmath13 4.1.2 , even dust as small as 0.003@xmath0 at this distance ( 5 - 7@xmath9 ) would have to be on order of 70 - 80k to be heated by the central agn .",
    "this is not reasonable as such cool dust should emit substantially more ( on order of a few jy ) at 18@xmath0 where no significant emission is detected along this ridge .",
    "a more likely possibility is this emission is due to pah emission as detected by iso and spitzer at least at 8.8@xmath0 and possibility also 11.3@xmath0 in the n - band .",
    "nicmos imaging by schreier et al .",
    "( 1998 ) shows a 1@xmath9x2@xmath9 ( 20pc radius ) emission line region interpreted as a gaseous disk also possibly associated with a multi - layered torus which is nearly parallel to the radio jet and perpendicular to the co disk .",
    "schreier et al . ( 1998 ) hypothesized this peculiar angle may be caused by one of two scenarios .",
    "either that it had formed recently enough ( possibly associated with a merger or infall event ) such that it had not time to become aligned with the black hole spin axis , or because it was along the major axis of the bulge that it was dominated by the galaxy gravitational potential rather than that of the black hole . in either case these observations indicate that there may be an outer gaseous ring of material that is highly warped with respect to the inner compact mid - ir torus .",
    "though we do generally detect low - level mid - ir emission along this direction we detect no extension associated with this structure at the level of the fwhm .",
    "as discussed earlier , in both epoch a and b data extended mid - ir emission is detected approximately coincident with pa-@xmath2 clumps a and b from schreier et al .",
    "this emission also falls very near the axis of the powerful radio jet in cen a. at n - band especially ( figure 4 ) emission is seen along the inner part of the radio jet extending out past the pa-@xmath2 clumps a and b. as discussed above it is difficult to rule out shock induced star formation and/or dusty nlr emission . furthermore due to the possibility of inadequate chop - subtraction attempting to fit a synchrotron model to evaluate its contribution ,",
    "if any , is difficult . thus we can not confirm nor rule out some contribution from synchrotron radiation emanating from the jet near the nucleus .",
    "farther out along the jet axis in the ne direction negative emission from improper chop subtraction becomes more apparent in both epoch a and b data and some faint mid - ir emission associated with the jet is most likely lost .",
    "however in epoch b at n - band there is clear evidence of mid - ir emission located farther out and coincident with the radio axis .",
    "this new source is denoted as rpl 1 ( figure 4 ) .",
    "rpl 1 is located in a very bright area of the radio jet at a distance of 18.4@xmath9 pa=(53@xmath4 measured north to east ) .",
    "it is outside the field of view of the epoch a data and thus can not be characterized at 8.8@xmath0 and 18.3@xmath0 . given the distance as projected on sky 18.4@xmath9 is equal to @xmath28300 pc .",
    "this rules out dust heated by the central source , as it would take a beaming factor of @xmath28500 to heat even the smallest dust grains to a temperature of 200k .",
    "if no beaming is assumed the maximum temperature that a blackbody heated by the central agn could obtain at that distance is 42k , which given an approximate flux density of 2mjy at n - band would require a 25@xmath0 flux several hundred thousand times what is measured by iras .",
    "confidence in the detection of this source is strong as it is seen on all three nights observed at n - band and after a 20 pixel ( 1.78@xmath9 ) offset / dither between nights .",
    "stacking all three nights of data results in a 3 - 4@xmath19 detection ( figure 4 ) .",
    "mid - ir emission from a synchrotron jet has been seen in m87 ( perlman et al . 2001 ) and at larger radii from cen a by spitzer ( hkw06 ) , however in these cases the mid - ir morphology and position showed a strong spatial and morphological correspondence to that of the radio emission from the jet .",
    "this does not seem to be the case in rpl 1 which is located offset @xmath32@xmath9 from a bright radio knot and with a much less elongated shape .",
    "another possible explanation is a dusty clump heated by the impact or shock of the outflow impinging on surrounding material associated with jet induced star formation .",
    "however it is possible that the morphology of this weak source is affected by improper chop subtraction of the crowded mid - ir emission in cen a and thus it requires further investigation .",
    "we detect a bright unresolved mid - ir nucleus surrounded by low - level emission in the central region of centaurus a. we find the bright central nucleus of cen a to be unresolved in the mid - ir at the level of the fwhm .",
    "using multiple psf measurements and their variation , we place an upper limit on the size of the mid - ir nucleus of cen a of 3.2 pc ( 0@xmath119 ) at 8.8@xmath0 and 3.5 pc ( 0@xmath121 ) at 18.3@xmath0 .",
    "this is consistent with our models which predict the mid - ir emission from a torus in cen a to be unresolved with a size of 0@xmath105 or less .",
    "the primary source of the nuclear mid - ir emission is likely to be associated with this dusty torus and nlr emission with minimal contributions from starburst and synchrotron emission .    extended mid - ir emission in cen a is generally coincident with pa-@xmath2 regions most likely due to stellar activity .",
    "a ridge of mid - ir emission perpendicular to the radio axis and devoid of much pa-@xmath2 emission may be associated with a co , h@xmath60 outer ring / bar .",
    "emission associated with pa-@xmath2 clumps a and b from schreier et al .",
    "( 1998 ) could be due to shock heating or possibly centrally heated dust in a nlr if anisotropic beaming of radiation along the radio axis is taken into account .",
    "a new mid - ir source rpl 1 , is detected along the radio axis at a distance of 18.4@xmath9 ( pa=53@xmath4 ) and is possibly due to shock heating of material impacted by the jet or synchrotron emission .",
