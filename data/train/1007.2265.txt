    "since the common topological characteristics called _ small - world _ ( sw ) and _ scale - free _ ( sf ) have been revealed in social , technological , and biological networks , researches on complex networks have attracted much attention in this decade through the historical progress @xcite .",
    "the topological structure is quite different from the conventionally assumed regular and random graphs , and has both desirable and undesirable properties : short paths counted by hops between any two nodes and the fault - tolerance for random node removals @xcite on the one hand but the vulnerability against intentional attacks on hubs @xcite on the other hand . in the definition of a network ,",
    "spatial positions of nodes and distances of links are usually ignored , these simplifications are reasonable in some networks such as the world - wide - web , citation networks , and biological metabolic networks . however , as real - life infrastructures , in communication networks , transportation systems , and the power grid , they are crucial factors ; a node is embedded in a mixing of sparse and dense areas according to the population densities , and a connection between nodes depends on communication efficiency or economical cost .",
    "thus , a modeling of geographical networks is important to understand the fundamental mechanism for generating both topological and spatial properties in realistic communication and transportation systems .",
    "many methods for geographically constructing complex networks have been proposed from the viewpoints of the generation mechanism and the optimization . as a typical generation mechanism",
    ", a spatially preferential attachment is applied in some extensions @xcite of the barabsi - albert ( ba ) model @xcite . as typical optimizations in the deterministic models",
    "@xcite , there are several criteria for maximizing the traffic under a constraint @xcite , minimizing a fraction of the distance and node degree with an expectation of short hops @xcite , and minimizing a sum of weighted link lengths w.r.t the edge betweenness as the throughput @xcite or the forwarding load at nodes @xcite . in these methods , various topologies ranging from a river network to a sf network",
    "emerge according to the parameter values .",
    "the river network resembles a proximity graph known in computer science , which has connections in a particular neighbor relationship between nodes embedded in a plane . in constructing these networks",
    ", it is usually assumed that the positions of nodes are distributed uniformly at random , and that a population density or the number of passengers is ignored in communication or transportation networks except in some works @xcite .",
    "however , in real data @xcite , a population density is mapped to the number of router nodes on earth , the spatial distribution of nodes does not follow uniformly distributed random positions represented by a poisson point process .",
    "such a spatially inhomogeneous distribution of nodes is found in air transportation networks @xcite and in mobile communication networks @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , geometric methods have also been proposed as another generation mechanism , in which both sw and sw structures are generated by a recursive growing rule for the division of a chosen triangle @xcite or for the attachment aiming at a chosen edge @xcite in random or hierarchical selection .",
    "the position of a newly added node is basically free as far as the geometric operations are possible , and has no relation to a population .",
    "thus , the spatial structure with geographical constraints on nodes and links has not been investigating enough . in particular , considering the effects of a population on a geographical network is necessary to self - organize a spatial distribution of nodes that is suitable for socio - economic communication and transportation requests .    in this paper , as a possibility , we pay attention to a combination of complex network science and computer science ( in particular , computational geometry and routing algorithm ) approaches .",
    "this provides a new direction of research on self - organized networks by taking into account geographical densities of nodes and population .",
    "we consider an evolutionary network with a spatially inhomogeneous distribution of nodes based on a stochastic point process .",
    "our point process differs from the tessellations for a voronoi partitioning with different intensities of points @xcite and for a modeling of crack patterns @xcite .",
    "we aim to develop a future design method of ad hoc networks , e.g. , on a dynamic environment which consists of mobile users , for increasing communication requests , and wide - area wireless and wired connections .",
    "more precisely , the territory of a node defined as the nearest access point is iteratively divided for load balancing of communication requests which are proportional to a population density in the area .",
    "a geographical network consisting of a self - similar tiling is constructed by recursive subdivision of faces according to a population .",
    "it is worth noting that positions of nodes and a network topology are simultaneously decided by the point process in a self - organized manner .",
    "furthermore , the geographical network has several advantages @xcite : the robustness of connectivity , the short path lengths , and the decentralized routing algorithm @xcite . taking these advantages into consideration",
    ", we generalize the point process biased by a population for constructing a geographical network , and investigate the traffic load on the shortest distance routing .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce a more general network model for self - similar tilings than the previous model @xcite based on triangulations . by applying the geometric divisions",
    ", we construct a geographical network according to a given population . in sec .",
    "iii , we show the properties of the shortest path and the decentralized routing without a global table for packet transfers as applied in the internet .",
    "we numerically investigate the traffic load in the proposed network , comparing it with the load in other geographical networks .",
    "in particular , we show that our geographical network is better than the state - of - the - art geographical networks in terms of shorter paths and link lengths , and of lower load for avoiding traffic congestion . in sec .",
    "iv , we summarize the results and briefly discuss further studies .",
    "we introduce a multi - scale quartered ( msq ) network , which is stochastically constructed by a self - similar tiling according to a given population .",
    "let us consider the basic process of network construction @xcite .",
    "each node corresponds to a base station for transferring packets , and a link between two nodes corresponds to a wireless or wired communication line .",
    "until a network size @xmath0 is reached , the following process is repeated from an initial configuration which consists of equilateral triangles or squares . at each time step , a triangle ( or square ) face is chosen with a probability proportional to the population in the space of the triangle ( or square ) .",
    "then , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig_subdivision](a ) and [ fig_subdivision](b ) , four smaller triangle ( or square ) faces are created by adding facility nodes at the intermediate points on the communication links of the chosen triangle ( or square ) .",
    "this process can be implemented autonomously for a division of the area with the increase of communication requests .",
    "thus , a planar network is self - organized on a geographical space .",
    "figure [ fig_geo_nets ] shows an example of the geographical msq network according to real population data . if we ignore the reality for a distribution of population , the msq network includes a sierpinski gasket obtained by a special selection when each triangle , except the central one , is hierarchically divided .",
    "blocks for @xmath1 ) provided by the japan statistical association are mapped onto each triangle by counting the number of people in the space . from light ( orange ) to dark ( red ) , the gradation on a mesh block is proportionally assigned to the population . in the middle of the main island of japan ,",
    "almost all of the blocks consist of flat lands and mountains , and do not come in contact with the sea except in the left bottom curved white area.,height=264 ]    the state - of - the - art geometric growing network models @xcite are summarized in table [ table_geometric_nets ] .",
    "the basic process for network generation is based on the division of a triangle or on the extension of an edge with a bypass route as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_ran ] . for these models",
    ", we can also consider a mixing of dense and sparse areas of nodes by selecting a triangle or an edge according to a population in the territory .",
    "although the geographical position of a new node has not been so far exactly defined in the geometric processes , it is obviously different from that in the msq network .",
    "moreover , in the pseudofractal sf network @xcite , the link length tends to be longer than that in the msq network , because a node is set freely at an exterior point .",
    "whereas the newly added three nodes approach each other in the sierpinski network @xcite as the iteration progresses , they are degenerated ( shrunken ) to one node as in the random apollonian network @xcite .",
    "thus , we focus on the apollonian network constructed by a biased selection of a triangle according to a population . in sec .",
    "iii , we compare the topological and the routing properties in the ba - like and the apollonian networks with those in the msq network .",
    "the above geometric models generate sf networks whose degree distribution follows a power - law .",
    "it is known that a sf network is extremely vulnerable against intentional attacks on hubs @xcite , in particular the tolerance of connectivity is more weakened by geographical constraints on linking @xcite .",
    "however , the msq network without high degree nodes has a quite different property .",
    "the msq network consists of trimodal low degrees : @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 for an initial triangle ( @xmath5 , and @xmath6 for an initial square ) configuration . because of",
    "the trimodal low degrees without hubs , the robustness against both random failures and intentional attacks is maintained @xcite at a similar level as the optimal bimodal networks @xcite with a larger maximum degree @xmath7 in a class of multimodal networks , which include a sf network at the maximum modality @xmath8 as the worst case for the robustness .    in the msq network ,",
    "the construction method defined by recursive subdivision of equilateral triangles or squares can be extensively applied to self - similar tilings based on polyomino @xcite , polyiamond @xcite , and polyform @xcite , as shown in fig . [ fig_subdivision](c ) . in the general construction on a polygon ,",
    "some links are removed from the primitive tiling which consists of equilateral triangles or squares in order to be a specially shaped face such as a `` sphinx '' or `` chair '' at each time step of the subdivision .",
    "it remains to be determined whether or not the robustness of connectivity is weaker than that in our geographical networks based on equilateral triangles or squares .",
    "however , the path length becomes larger at least , as mentioned in sec .",

    "both mobile communication and wide - area wireless technologies ( or high - speed mass mobilities ) are important more and more to sustain our socio - economic activities , however it is an issue to construct an efficient and robust network on the dynamic environment which depends on realistic communication ( or transportation ) requests . in order to design the future ad hoc networks , we have considered geographical network constructions , in which the spatial distribution of nodes is naturally determined according to a population in a self - organized manner . in particular , the proposed msq network model is constructed by a self - similar tiling for load balancing of communication requests in the territories of nodes . on a combination of complex network science and computer science approaches ,",
    "this model has several advantages @xcite : the robustness of connectivity , the bounded short paths , and the efficient decentralized routing on a planar network .",
    "moreover , we have numerically shown that the msq network is better in term of shorter link lengths than the geographical apollonian and the ba - like networks which have various topologies ranging from river to sf networks .",
    "as regards the traffic properties in the msq network , the node load ( defined by the maximum node betweenness ) is lower with a smaller @xmath9 in the scaling relation @xmath10 , although the link load is at a similar level as that of the other geographical networks .",
    "therefore , the msq network is more tolerant to traffic congestion than the state - of - the - art geographical network models .    in a realistic situation ,",
    "packets are usually more often generated and received at a node whose population is large in the territory .",
    "thus , we take into account spatially inhomogeneous generations and removals of packets according to a population . concerning the effect of population on the traffic load , the heavy - loaded routes with much throughput of packets",
    "are observed between large population areas especially for a small size @xmath0 .",
    "the heavy - loaded parts are not trivial but localized depending on the geographical connection structure , whichever a spatial distribution of nodes or biased selections of the source and the terminal is more dominant . in further studies , such spatially",
    "biased selections of packets should be investigated more to predict overloaded parts on a realistic traffic , since the selections may depend on other economic and social activities in tradings or community relationships beyond the activities related only to population , and probably affect the optimal topologies for the traffic @xcite .",
    "the optimal routing @xcite instead of our shortest distance routing is also important for reducing the maximum betweenness ( @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) and the exponent @xmath9 in the scaling relation . in the optimizations that include other criteria",
    "@xcite , we will investigate the performance of the msq networks .",
    "related discussions to urban street networks @xcite are attractive for investigating a common property which has arisen from the geographically pseudofractal structures .",
    "the authors would like to thank prof .",
    "tesuo asano for suggesting the proof in the appendix and anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments .",
    "this research is supported in part by a grant - in - aid for scientific research in japan , grant no .",
    "we provide a sketch of the proof for the @xmath13-spanner property in the msq networks . the following is similarly discussed for other polygons by exchanging the term `` triangle '' or `` triangulation '' with other words ( e.g. , `` square '' or `` polygonal subdivision '' ) , except that the maximum stretch factor @xmath13 may be greater than two for a general polygon .",
    "remember that the self - similar tiling is obtained from the division by a contraction map as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_subdivision ] .",
    "let @xmath14 be a given triangulation and @xmath15 be a line segment interconnecting two vertices @xmath16 and @xmath17 in @xmath14 .",
    "it intersects many triangle faces in @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath18 be those ordered vertices .",
    "now , we define a path using triangular edges . for any two consecutive vertices @xmath19 and @xmath20 there is a unique triangle which contain both of them . in other words ,",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 are the entrance and the exit of the line segment to the triangle . for the pair @xmath21",
    "there are two paths , clockwise and anticlockwise , on the triangle .",
    "we take the shorter one . in this way",
    ", we can define a path on the given triangulation . if the path contains duplicated segments with the opposite directions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_typical_path ] , we remove them .",
    "then , we have a path such that each edge of the path is some triangular side .",
    "when the two consecutive edges on the path belong to the links of a same triangle , we take a shortcut by directly passing another edge ( see two edges @xmath22-@xmath23 and @xmath23-@xmath24 are replaced with @xmath22-@xmath24 on the path in fig.[fig_typical_path ] ) .",
    "since @xmath14 is planar and there is no node inside each triangle , the length of this path is the closest to that of the line segment @xmath15 , therefore the shortest in all other routes . as is easily seen , in each triangle , the path length between @xmath19 and @xmath20 is at most twice longer than the euclidean distance between them .",
    "the worst case of the maximum stretch factor @xmath25 is illustrated in fig .",
