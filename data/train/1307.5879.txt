    "since alexandre rothen described the `` ellipsometer '' in 1945  @xcite , the technique has been developed into a well known procedure to measure film thicknesses and to determine optical properties of a film .",
    "ellipsometry applies light of a well - defined state of polarization that is reflected from the investigated multilayer system .",
    "after reflection the state of polarization is analyzed .",
    "one application of the technique is the determination of the refractive index of a gas condensed on a surface at low temperature  @xcite . in this case , the film must not contain impurities and the layer system has to be enclosed in a vacuum chamber .    in the past many different variations of ellipsometry set - ups were realized @xcite .",
    "because of the arrangement of olarizer , ompensator , optical ystem and nalyzer , this commonly used constellation is called `` pcsa '' arrangement ( see figure  [ fig : pcsa ] ) . in standard applications",
    "so - called null - ellipsometry is used : here the polarizer and the compensator produce elliptically polarized light such that after the reflection at the multilayer system the light is fully linearly polarized .",
    "thus it can be extinguished by an analyzer .    ,",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 in the following.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]        in order to measure thin films with sub - monolayer resolution in a cryogenic ultra - high vacuum environment , a high resolution null - ellipsometry variant has been explored in this work .",
    "when measuring thin cryogenic films , using standard experimental arrangements all optical elements remain outside the vacuum chamber at room temperature before and after the multilayer system ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "whenever this is not possible the method presented here is an interesting alternative .",
    "such a situation could arise if the reflected light after passing the multilayer system would have to be guided out of the vacuum chamber over a large distance before entering the analyzer section .",
    "the reason for this could be  like in our case case  a not perfectly flat substrate causing a too large divergence of the reflected beam . to circumvent this problem",
    ", the reflected light needs to be analyzed and detected inside the vacuum chamber .",
    "if then the analyzer can not be rotated because of limited space or too low temperatures , the analyzer has to be fixed at a certain angle and the ellipsometry has to be applied in a modified manner .",
    "our particular pcsa implementation addresses these technical constraints by rotating the compensator in addition to the polarizer and searching for the intensity minimum with a fixed analyzer orientation .",
    "as far as we know an ellipsometry variant with fixed analyzer and rotating compensator was presented to be possible in @xcite but we havent found applications or results of such an ellipsometer in literature .    it will be shown that this method allows the determination of arbitrary film thickness like the standard pcsa method with rotating analyzer and polarizer . specifically , we apply this variant of standard pcsa ellipsometry at our conversion electron calibration source for the katrin neutrino mass experiment @xcite : we condense the krypton isotope @xmath4kr on a highly - oriented pyrolytic graphite ( hopg ) substrate at cryogenic temperatures ( @xmath5 ) under ultra - high vacuum conditions  .",
    "this electron source is positioned inside a superconducting split - coil magnet in a ln@xmath6 cooled ultra - high vacuum environment .",
    "the reflected light would have to be guided out of the vacuum chamber over a distance of about 2  m. unfortunately , this is not possible due to the beam divergence caused by the polycrystalline structure of the hopg substrate .",
    "therefore the light has to be analyzed and detected inside the vacuum chamber at cryogenic temperatures .",

    "fig : pcsa ] ) . following the notation of @xcite",
    "we describe a dielectric medium by a complex refractive index @xmath12",
    ". with the definition of a plane wave in z - direction of @xmath13 @xmath14 becomes the index of refraction and @xmath15 the extinction coefficient .",
    "thus the absorption coefficient @xmath16 can be expressed by the extinction coefficient ( @xmath15 ) and the vacuum wavelength ( @xmath17 ) as @xmath18 .",
    "we assume that the film can be described by an refractive index @xmath19 with only a negligible extinction @xmath20 .",
    "also for the ambient ( usually vacuum or a gas atmosphere ) we assume a real index of refraction @xmath21 . only the substrate is described by a complex index of refraction @xmath22 .",
    "the reflection properties of this system are given by the complex reflection coefficients @xmath23 and @xmath24 for the multilayer system @xcite @xmath25 with @xmath26 being the coefficients of single reflection for the various interfaces .",
    "these are calculated using the fresnels formulas for the interfaces between the ambient medium and the film ( index `` 01 '' ) or between the film and the substrate ( index `` 12 '' ) for perpendicular ( denoted `` s '' ) and parallel ( denoted `` p '' ) polarized waves with respect to the plane of incidence .",
    "the coefficients @xmath26 depend on the indices of refraction of the regarded interface and the angle of incidence @xmath10 . for a vacuum wavelength @xmath27 of the laser ,",
    "the film thickness @xmath11 causes a phase shift @xmath28 :    @xmath29    as usual @xmath30 and @xmath3 constitute the rotation angles of the polarizer and analyzer as defined by the orientation of transmitted polarized light with respect to the plane of incidence ( see figure [ fig : pcsa ] ) .",

    "we refer to reference  @xcite .",
    "we would like to note that in the literature the complex variable @xmath37 is often expressed as @xmath38 where @xmath39 corresponds to the absolute value and @xmath40 to the complex phase of @xmath41 in the polar expression . in the modified variant of pcsa ellipsometry , which was outlined in the introduction ,",

    "we are determining the minimum of the light intensity as function of the polarizer and compensator angles @xmath30 and @xmath2 for a fixed analyzer angle @xmath3 .",
    "from now on we call this method `` pc ellipsometry '' . via equation ( [ eqn : grundgln ] ) the angles @xmath30 and @xmath2 define a complex variable @xmath37 . in order to facilitate the determination of the corresponding film thickness @xmath43",
    "we define two corresponding angles @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "similar to eulers representation , we generally can express any complex number @xmath37 by two angles @xmath46 as @xmath47 therefore we can translate our angles @xmath30 and @xmath2 defining the intensity minimum for a given film thickness @xmath11 into the corresponding angles @xmath44 and @xmath45 via : @xmath48 the left - hand side of equation ( [ eqn : pseudo_trans ] ) looks identical to equation ( [ eqn : pa_elli ] ) for @xmath49 .",
    "this means , if a film thickness @xmath11 would be characterized by a pair ( @xmath30,@xmath2 ) in pc ellipsometry , the transformation with equation  ( [ eqn : pseudo_trans ] ) describes which angles @xmath45 and @xmath44 would have been encountered in standard pa ellipsometry for the same film thickness .",

    "<S> _ in this paper we describe a new variant of null ellipsometry to determine thicknesses and optical properties of thin films on a substrate at cryogenic temperatures . in the pcsa arrangement of ellipsometry the olarizer and the ompensator are placed before the ubstrate and the nalyzer after it . </S>",
    "<S> usually , the polarizer and the analyzer are rotated to find the intensity minimum searched for in null ellipsometry . in our variant </S>",
    "<S> we rotate the polarizer and the compensator instead , both being placed in the incoming beam before the substrate . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the polarization analysis of the reflected beam can be realized by an analyzer at fixed orientation . </S>",
    "<S> we developed this method for investigations of thin cryogenic films inside a vacuum chamber , where the analyzer and detector had to be placed inside the cold shield at a temperature of @xmath0  k close to the substrate . </S>",
    "<S> all other optical components were installed at the incoming beam line outside the vacuum chamber , including all components which need to be rotated during the measurements . </S>",
    "<S> our null ellipsometry variant has been tested with condensed krypton films on a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite substrate ( hopg ) at a temperature of @xmath1  k. we show that it is possible to determine the indices of refraction of condensed krypton and of the hopg substrate as well as thickness of krypton films with reasonable accuracy . _ </S>"
