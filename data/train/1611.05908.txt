    "knowing the electronic structure of impurity atoms is essential for understanding the physics of device operation .",
    "moreover , the interpretation of the measured stm images requires the accurate modeling not only of the energy spectra , but also of the real - space wave functions of the impurities .",
    "the same is true for analysing the hyperfine structure of the energy spectra of shallow donors where the charge density at the impurity nucleus determines the energy splitting @xcite .",
    "computational approaches for determining the electronic structure of impurities in silicon can be divided into two classes : supercell methods and effective - mass techniques .",
    "the tight - binding method @xcite and methods based on density functional theory with pseudopotentials and plane - wave expansions belong to the first class .",
    "since the effective bohr radius @xcite of a phosphorus donor atom in silicon is 3.1 nm , the size of the supercell used in those methods varies from @xmath0 to @xmath1 atoms @xcite .",

    "all relevant information about the band structure of bulk silicon is contained in a small number of so - called band structure parameters .",
    "however , applying successfully effective mass theory for donor atoms in silicon is challenging due to the strong central cell attractive potential that leads to valley - orbit coupling @xcite .    the pioneering work of pantelides and sah @xcite led to significant progress in the modeling the spherically - symmetric central - cell part of the impurity potential by using _",

    "[ ] , pantelides and sah have demonstrated the important role of the static dielectric screening in the central - cell potential that has been also justified by recent tight - binding computations @xcite .",
    "usually , the expected tetrahedral symmetry , which is responsible for valley - orbit splitting , is imposed not on the potential itself , but on the wave function using group - theoretical considerations like in the friztsche - twose equations @xcite .",
    "this approach works well for non - interacting impurities in bulk silicon , but its extension to impurity clusters or any non - spherically - symmetric confinement potentials is not trivial .",
    "moreover while the energy spectrum is reproduced accurately , the corresponding wave functions do not fit to the current experimental data from the stm measurements @xcite .",

    "the number of fitting parameters varies from a single one in [ ] to five in [ ] ( most often three fitting parameters are used @xcite ) . in the paper of gamble",
    "@xcite , the proper tetrahedral symmetry has been imposed directly on the central - cell potential .",
    "although effective - mass approaches with fitting parameters can reproduce energy spectra and electron densities at the impurity nuclei accurately , the overall shape of the wave functions is not guaranteed to be correct .",

    ", the approach should guarantee the correct overall shape of the wave function and reproduce the energy spectrum . to avoid using fitting parameters , instead of the conventional envelope - function approximation @xcite",
    ", we derive the system of the envelope function equations starting from the exact burt - foreman envelope function representation .",
    "we show that this representation is equivalent to linear combination of bulk bands or plane - wave expansions .",
    "using an exact envelope - function representation enables to implement systematic series truncation and to associate each envelope function with a defined region in the k - space .",
    "the resulting envelope function equations are formally equivalent to the shindo - nara equations @xcite and contain a smooth effective potential which is derived _ ab initio _ and depends on periodic bloch functions and on the attractive potential of the impurity .",
    "the effective potential results from a low - pass filtering procedure imposed by the periodic boundary conditions of the crystal lattice and from a systematic truncation of approximating series ( e.g. the single - band approximation ) . we compute the effective potential using the point - charge potential with a static screening as a model for the central - cell potential of the impurity atom @xcite .",
    "this model is valid for p. for non - isocoric impurities , such as as , the point charge must be replaced by a distance - dependent potential that can be computed using density functional theory or the _ ab initio _",
    "technique described in [ ] .",
    "the crystal symmetry is introduced in the basis set by using the periodic bloch functions computed at the level of the density functional theory with the local density approximation ( dft - lda ) .",
    "models combining the effective mass method and _ ab initio _ computations have been used before by several authors @xcite .",
    "our model also relies on that approach , however it is implemented so that all atomistic details of the wave function within the unit cell are mapped to smooth real - space potentials without any fitting with experimental data .",
    "these potentials can be viewed as local pseudo - potentials and further used in effective mass calculations .",
    "the computational method should take into account complicated configurations of external electrostatic fields and confinement potential . in the effective mass approach , this can be implemented variationally either by using predefined basis sets with several variational parameters which can be adjusted to electrostatic fields @xcite or by using a grid method in real or momentum space . here ,",
    "we compute the wave function using a combined method : the schroedinger equation is first solved neglecting the valley - orbit coupling for an arbitrary confinement potential and external electrostatic fields by a real space grid method , and , then the computed wave functions are used as a basis set in a variational procedure that diagonalizes the schroedinger equation that includes the valley - orbit coupling .",
    "this makes our approach flexible and well adapted for any silicon nanostructures .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we define the multi - valley envelope function and show its relations with the plane - wave expansion and the linear - combination of bulk bands representation .",
    "we then derive the envelope function equation . in section iii ,",
    "we derive the expressions for the potential energy terms and compute them using a screened coulomb potential with a static screening and periodic bloch functions from dft - lda calculations . in section",
    "iv we present our numerical approach for solving the system of envelope function equations and show results of energy spectrum computations for p donor atom in silicon .",

    "<S> we propose a system of real - space envelope function equations without fitting parameters for modeling the electronic spectrum and wave functions of a phosphorus donor atom embedded in silicon . </S>",
    "<S> the approach relies on the burt - foreman envelope function representation and leads to coupled effective - mass schroedinger equations containing smooth effective potentials . </S>",
    "<S> these potentials result from the spatial filtering imposed on the exact potential energy matrix elements in the envelope function representation . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding filter function is determined from the definition of the envelope function . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting effective potentials and the system of envelope functions jointly reproduce the valley - orbit coupling effect in the doped silicon . including the valley - orbit coupling not only of the 1s , but also for 2s atomic orbitals , as well as static dielectric screening </S>",
    "<S> is found crucial to accurately reproduce experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> the measured binding energies are recovered with a maximum relative error of 1.53 % . </S>",
    "<S> the computed wave functions are in a good agreement with experimental measurements of the electron density provided by scanning tunneling microscopy . </S>"
