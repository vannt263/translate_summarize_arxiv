    "lepton number ( l ) conservation is one of the most obscure sides of the standard model(sm ) not supported by an underlying principle and following from an accidental interplay between gauge symmetry and field content .",
    "any deviation from the sm structure may introduce l non - conservation ( ) . over the years the possibility of lepton number non - conservation has been attracting a great deal of theoretical and experimental efforts since any positive experimental @xmath7 signal would request physics beyond the sm .",
    "in addition it would also show , that neutrinos are majorana particles @xcite .",
    "recent neutrino oscillation experiments practically established the presence of non - zero neutrino masses , a fact that itself points to physics beyond the sm .",
    "however neutrino oscillations are not sensitive to the nature of neutrino masses : they can either be majorana or dirac masses leading to the same observables .    the principal question if neutrinos are majorana or dirac particles can be answered only by studying a lepton number violating processes since @xmath8 is a generic tag of majorana neutrinos .",
    "various lepton - number violating processes have been discussed in the literature in this respect ( for recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "they offer the possibility of probing different entries of the majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath9 . among them",
    "there are a few @xmath7 nuclear processes having prospects for experimental searches : neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath10 ) , muon to positron @xmath0 conversion and , probably , muon to antimuon @xmath11 conversion @xcite .",
    "they probe @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 matrix elements respectively .",
    "currently the most sensitive experiment intended to distinguish the majorona nature of neutrinos are those searching for neutrinoless @xmath10-decay @xcite the nuclear theory side @xcite of this process have been significantly improved in the last decade @xcite allowing reliable extraction of fundamental particle physics parameters from experimental data .",
    "muon to positron nuclear conversion @xmath0 is another @xmath7 nuclear process with good experimental prospects .",
    "the important role of muon as a test particle in the search for new physics beyond the standard model has been recognized long time ago .",
    "when negative muons penetrate into matter they can be trapped to atomic orbits .",
    "then the bound muon can disappear either decaying into an electron and two neutrinos or being captured by the nucleus , i.e. , due to ordinary muon capture .",
    "these two processes conserving both total lepton number and lepton flavors have been well studied both theoretically and experimentally . however , there are two other not yet observed channels of muon capture : the muon - electron ( @xmath15 ) and muon - positron ( @xmath16 ) conversions in nuclei @xcite : @xmath17 apparently , the ( @xmath16 ) and ( @xmath15 ) conversion processes violate lepton number l and lepton flavor @xmath18 conservation respectively .",
    "additional differences between the @xmath19 and @xmath20 lie on the nuclear physics side .",
    "the first process can proceed on one nucleon of the participating nucleus while the second process involves two nucleons as dictated by charge conservation @xcite .",
    "note also that the @xmath19 conversion amplitude is quadratic and @xmath20 amplitude linear in the neutrino mass .",
    "thus the second process looks more sensitive to the light neutrino masses .",
    "the present experimental limit on @xmath0 conversion branching ratio in @xmath21ti is @xcite @xmath22    in the present paper we study the light majorana neutrino mechanism for the @xmath23 conversion . despite the previous rough estimates @xcite indicate a very small branching ratio for this mode of @xmath23 conversion , by far below the experimental bound ( [ eq.2 ] ) , we undertake a detailed study of this mode for several reasons .",
    "first , the nuclear theory of @xmath23 conversion is not yet sufficiently elaborated , as in the case of @xmath10-decay , and requires further development .",
    "second , @xmath23 conversion may receive contribution from other mechanisms offered by various models beyond the sm such as the r - parity violating supersymmetric models , the leptoquark extensions of the sm etc .",
    "some of these mechanisms may involve the light neutrino exchange and , therefore , from the view point of nuclear structure calculations they resemble the ordinary light neutrino mechanism .",
    "thus our present study can be viewed as a first step towards a more general description of @xmath23 conversion including all the possible mechanisms .    below",
    "we develop a detailed nuclear structure theory for the light neutrino exchange mechanism of this process on the basis of the nuclear proton - neutron renormalized quasiparticle random phase approximation ( pn - qrpa ) wave functions @xcite .",
    "we perform a realistic calculation of the width of this process for the nuclear target @xmath1 using limits on neutrino masses and mixings from neutrino oscillation phenomenology .",
    "a comparison with the previous estimations of @xmath24 will be also presented @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the possible values of majorana neutrino masses and mixings are discussed in sect .",
    "2 . the amplitude and width of @xmath0 conversion are derived in sect .",
    "the details of the calculation for the case of @xmath0 conversion in @xmath1 and our results are given in sect .",
    "4 . in sect .",
    "5 we summarize our conclusions .",
    "the finite masses of neutrinos are tightly related to the problem of lepton flavor / number violation . the dirac , majorona and dirac - majorana neutrino mass terms in the lagrangian offer different neutrino mixing schemes and allow various lepton number / flavor violating processes @xcite .",
    "the favored neutrino mixing schemes has to accommodate present neutrino phenomenology in a natural way , in particular , to answer the question of the smallness of neutrino masses compared to the charged lepton ones .",
    "the most prominent guiding principle in this problem is the see - saw mechanism which can be realized in various models beyond the sm .",
    "a generic neutrino mass term is given by the formula @xmath25",
    "+ h.c . \\label{eq.3}\\ ] ] the first two terms do not conserve the total lepton number @xmath26 . here , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the weak doublet and singlet flavor eigenstates .",
    "the indices l and r refer to the left - handed and right - handed chirality states , respectively , and the superscript @xmath29 refers to the operation of charge conjugation . @xmath30 and @xmath31 are complex non - diagonal symmetrical 3x3 matrices .",
    "the flavor neutrino fields are superpositions of six majorana fields @xmath32 with definite masses @xmath33 .",
    "yanagida , gell - mann , ramond and slansky suggested that the elements of @xmath34 and @xmath30 be comparable with the masses of charged leptons and the hypothetical scale of lepton number violation ( @xmath35 ) , respectively .",
    "then by diagonalization of the dirac - majorana mass term one ends up with the three very light and three very heavy neutrino eigenstates .",
    "this is the celebrated see - saw mechanism . enlarging the number of the right handed neutrino states @xmath36",
    "one can introduce sterile light mass eigenstates which may play a certain role in the explanation of the neutrino oscillation data including the lsnd results .",
    "however the active - sterile neutrino oscillations as a dominant channel seems to be disfavored according to a recent super kamiokande global analysis @xcite and work in tbingen @xcite .    sticking to the three neutrino scenario",
    "one may try to reconstruct the corresponding mass matrix from the neutrino oscillation data .",
    "this requires certain assumptions on its structure or additional experimental data .",
    "solar , atmospheric and lsnd neutrino data give information on the neutrino mass square differences @xmath37 as well as on the mixing angles of the unitary matrix @xmath38 @xcite relating the weak @xmath39 and mass @xmath40 neutrino eigenstates @xmath41 this information can be used to restore the neutrino mass matrix inverting its diagonalization as @xmath42 if additional assumptions about the overall mass scale as well as about the cp phases @xmath43 of the neutrino mass eigenstates are made .",
    "this matrix can be identified with the @xmath44 majorana mass terms @xmath30 in ( [ eq.3 ] ) and used in various phenomenological applications , for instance , in analysis of lepton number violating processes .",
    "the recent literature contains many sophisticated studies made in this direction ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the elements of the majorana mass matrix are related to the effective majorana neutrino masses @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) as @xmath47 neglecting mixing with heavy neutral states if they exist in the neutrino mass spectrum .",
    "amplitudes of lepton number violating processes are proportional to the corresponding effective neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath48-decay amplitude is proportional to @xmath49 , the so called effective electron neutrino mass @xcite . from the currently most stringent lower limit on @xmath48-decay half - life of @xmath50 @xmath51 @xcite one",
    "obtains @xmath52 @xcite .",

    "@xmath55 enters the amplitude of the @xmath0 conversion @xcite and of the kaon decay into a muon and a positron ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "some other elements of @xmath57 are associated with rare b - decays @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the maximal allowed values for the elements of @xmath58 have been deduced from solar , atmospheric , lsnd data and restriction coming from @xmath48-decay .",
    "the result is @xmath59 thus in our analysis of the light neutrino exchange mode of the @xmath0 conversion process we shall assume @xmath60 .",
    "we shall also use a more conservative model independent estimate of the effective neutrino mass .",
    "atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillation data show up @xmath61 suggesting that all the neutrino mass eigenstates are approximately degenerate at the 1 ev scale @xcite .",
    "this observation in combination with the tritium beta decay endpoint allows one to set upper bounds on masses of all the three neutrinos @xcite @xmath62ev .",
    "thus in the three neutrino scenario one derives @xmath63 for @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the process of @xmath23 conversion is very similar to the @xmath48-decay .",
    "both processes violate lepton number by two units and take place only if the neutrino is a majorana particle with non - zero mass . however , there are other important differences : i ) the available energies for these two processes differ considerably . in addition",
    ", the number of leptons in final states is different .",
    "these facts result in significantly different phase space integrals .",
    "ii ) the emitted positron in @xmath23 conversion has large momentum and therefore the long - wave approximation is not valid .",
    "iii ) as it will be shown below , in the case of light neutrino - exchange there is a singular behavior of the @xmath23 nuclear matrix element which is the additional source of the difficulties for the numerical integration .",
    "iv ) in the case of the @xmath23 conversion there is a great number of nuclear final states .",
    "nevertheless , the major contribution is here assumed to come from the transition to the ground state of the final nucleus .",
    "we shall discuss the amplitude and width of @xmath0 conversion in nuclei mediated by light majorana neutrinos .",
    "this process is shown in fig .",

    "contains contributions from all final nuclear states and not only from the @xmath140 transition as in our case .",

    "second , in the simplified calculation of doi et al .",
    "nuclear matrix elements were evaluated by summing the final nuclear states with closure .",

    "@xcite corresponds to a branching ratio equal to @xmath145 relative to the total absorption of the muon for the ground state to ground state transition .",

    "nevertheless , the studied neutrino exchange mode of lepton number violating @xmath0 conversion is not suitable for experimental study being extremely small compared to the ordinary muon capture .",
    "this fact , however , does not disfavor further experimental study of the @xmath0 conversion in nuclei as some other lepton number violating mechanisms , e.g. , those coming from gut s and susy models , can dominate this process .",
