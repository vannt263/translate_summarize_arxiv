    "it is well known that in the electric field , @xmath0 , and magnetic field @xmath1 , the energy of a system of charged particles with coordinates @xmath2 and momentums @xmath3 is @xcite @xmath4 considering the heat transfer , it is important to realize which terms in the above equation should be associated with the thermal energy .",
    "the uniform electric field accelerates all particles in the same way , while the effect of the magnetic field depends on the particle state .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to assume that the electric term ( the second term ) contributes to the potential energy , while the magnetic term ( the third term ) provides contribution to the thermal energy .",
    "of course , the above consideration can not be considered as a proof .",
    "moreover , there is no regular methods for identification of thermal energy .",
    "correctness of our assumption will be verified through the onsager relation between the ettingshausen and nernst coefficients , which describe the heat and electric currents initiated by the electric field and temperature gradient , correspondingly .",
    "we will show that the magnetic term overlooked in previous works plays a crucial role and restores the gauge invariance .",
    "while in accordance with van leeuwen s theorem @xcite the magnetic contribution to the heat transfer does not allow a classical interpretation , it is critically important for consistent quantum description of thermomagnetic transport .",
    "the definition of the heat current and the onsager relation in the magnetic field are long standing problems , which were attracted significant attention in the late sixties in the context of thermomagnetic vortex transport in the type - ii superconductors @xcite .",
    "maki @xcite has noted that the phenomenological @xcite and microscopic @xcite descriptions of thermomagnetic phenomena violate the third law of thermodynamic and the onsager relation . all attempts to resolve this enigma",
    "were based on thermodynamic treatment .",
    "various corrections suggested to the heat current are expressed in terms of the equilibrium magnetization currents @xcite .",
    "as we will show , the magnetization currents do not transfer the heat and the thermodynamic approach can not solve this problem .",
    "recently , much efforts have been dedicated to understanding of thermomagnetic effects in high-@xmath5 superconductors @xcite .",
    "variety of phenomenological concepts were suggested to explain anomalously large nernst signal above @xmath5 @xcite . in many papers @xcite the nernst effect",
    "is attributed to the motion of vortices created by phase fluctuations .",
    "microscopic models @xcite are based on the gaussian - fluctuation theory ( gft ) , which includes both module and phase fluctuations , but is applicable only near @xmath6 @xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) . however , the theories related to vortices are based on the results of refs . @xcite and @xcite , which inconsistency with basic principles",
    "was noted in @xcite .",
    "gft and other microscopic models also ignore corrections to the heat current .",
    "while the large nernst coefficient was obtained in all above models , there is still not much understanding of how superconducting fluctuations could lead to this effect . in the model of noninteracting electrons , which describes well ordinary metals , the nernst coefficient is small , because it is proportional to the square of the particle - hole asymmetry ( pha ) @xcite . in this case",
    ", the nernst coefficient combines phas of the thermoelectric , @xmath7 , and hall , @xmath8 , coefficients : @xmath9 .",
    "the interelectron interaction can not change pha of @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite . according to current points of view @xcite",
    ", the interaction in the cooper channel leads to the nernst coefficient in the zeroth order in pha .",
    "this effect is @xmath10 times larger than the corresponding correction to @xmath11 ( @xmath12 - is the fermi energy ) .",
    "however , experiments with ordinary superconductors , such as nb , al , sn , do not support this prediction .",
    "this contradiction is a consequence of a number of misconceptions at microscopic level .",
    "the microscopic formalism based on the kubo method allows one to calculate the ettingshausen coefficient @xmath13 , which describes the heat flux induced by crossed electric and magnetic fields , @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "the temperature gradient can not be directly introduced in the lagrange formalism of the kubo approach .",
    "therefore , the nernst coefficient , which relates the electric current with the temperature gradient , @xmath15 $ ] , is found from the onsager relation , @xmath16 the coefficient @xmath13 is calculated for the infinite sample , while the onsager relation is only valid for a finite sample @xcite , where surface currents should be taken into account .",
    "if magnetization depends on temperature , the temperature gradient generates surface magnetization currents , which provide important contribution to the charge transfer in the nernst effect @xcite .",
    "several recent works @xcite state that surface magnetization currents also play an important role in the heat transfer and the ettingshausen coefficient calculated for the infinite sample , @xmath17 , should be corrected due to the surface heat currents : @xmath18 . according to @xcite , gft leads to the bulk coefficient , which is of the same order as the correction due to surface currents : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the fluctuation magnetic susceptibility @xcite , @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23 ^ 2 $ ] , @xmath24 is the coherence length .    in the current paper",
    "we reconsider basics of the microscopic description of the thermomagnetic effects .",
    "this work will address the following questions : ( 1 ) is the heat current operator modified in the presence of a magnetic field ? ( 2 ) do surface magnetization currents transfer the heat ? ( 3 ) how do thermomagnetic coefficients satisfy the onsager relation ?",
    "( 4 ) finally , can the interelectron interaction change the pha of the nernst and ettingshausen coefficients ? while our results are quite general , we specify them for gft , which will be critically revised . in particular , we show that @xmath25 .",
    "in the gauge @xmath26 $ ] and @xmath27 , contributions of static electric and magnetic fields to the energy of a charged particle are easy separated , @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the chemical potential .",
    "let us first show the importance of the second ( magnetic ) term for noninteracting electrons @xcite .",
    "thermal energy is counted from the electro - chemical potential , so only the first and the second terms contribute to the heat current .",
    "the corresponding diagrams for the ettingshausen coefficient are shown in fig .",
    "1 . the diagram ( a ) has a form of the hall diagram @xcite , where the electric current operator , @xmath31 , is replaced by the heat current , @xmath32 .",
    "the hall effect is proportional to pha , i.e. the corresponding integrant is an odd function of @xmath33 and a nonzero hall coefficient is obtained after expansion of all parameters in @xmath34 near the fermi surface . with the heat current operator @xmath35 ,",
    "the integrant becomes an even function and gives a nonzero ettingshausen coefficient without expansion .",
    "however , this large contribution is canceled by the diagram ( b ) . the well - known expression for @xmath13 in a system of noninterating electrons",
    "is obtained in the second order in pha , when both integrants ( a ) and ( b ) are expanded in @xmath36 ( for details see an appendix in @xcite ) .",

    "the first and the forth terms in the eq .",
    "[ jh ] describes the energy flux of noninteracting electrons without fields .",
    "the second and third terms are due to electron interaction with magnetic and electric fields .",
    "two last terms are due to the electron - electron and electron - impurity interactions .",
    "these two terms generate diagram blocks ( aslamazov - larkin blocks ) proportional to pha , but contributions of all blocks with pha cancel each other @xcite .",
    "the thermal energy is defined as the electron energy counted from the electro - chemical potential @xmath42 and , therefore , the third and the forth terms in eq .",
    "[ jh ] do not contribute to the heat current .",
    "thus , calculating the heat current we should take into account only two heat current vertices @xmath43 and @xmath44 corresponding to the first ( kinetic ) and second ( magnetic ) terms in eq .",
    "[ jh ] .",
    "two leading terms in the heat current operator generate two diagrams , which describe @xmath13 in the aslamazov - larkin ( al ) approximation ( see fig .",

    "the last term in eq . [ p2 ] is proportional to pha @xcite .",
    "the al blocks @xmath50 presented in fig .",
    "2 are built from electron green functions and vertices @xmath51 ( see tab .",
    "1 ) . the left blocks @xmath52 and @xmath53 in figs .",
    "2.a and 2.b are blocks with heat current vertices @xmath43 ( kinetic ) and @xmath44 ( magnetic ) .",
    "the right block @xmath54 in both diagrams includes the electric current vertex @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "block @xmath57 includes the magnetic vertex @xmath58 .",
    "results of calculation are summarized in table i. al blocks are obtained by insertion vertices @xmath59 into the polarization operator and can be expressed through @xmath60 .",
    "blocks @xmath54 , @xmath61 , and @xmath52 are well known @xcite .",
    "the block @xmath62 describing the heat current in the absence of magnetic field has been calculated in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . here",
    "we introduce @xmath53 , which is based on the electron vertex @xmath63 and describes the magnetic correction to the heat current .    the first al diagram ( fig .",
    "2.a ) was investigated in ref . @xcite and its contribution is @xmath64 .",
    "the same result has been obtained in the time dependent ginzburg - landau formalism ( tdgl ) @xcite .",
    "contribution of the second al diagram ( fig .",
    "2.b ) is @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 is used for @xmath68 , and @xmath69 is the system dimensionality with respect to the coherence length @xmath24 .",
    "expanding the integrant to the linear order in @xmath70 and * k * and calculating the integrals over @xmath71 and @xmath72 , we find that the contribution of the second diagram , @xmath73 cancels completely the contribution of the first one .",
    "thus , without pha the ettingshausen effect is absent , @xmath74 . to get nonzero result , we should expand the fluctuation propagator ( eq . [ l1 ] ) up to the second order in pha . expanding the polarization operator ( eq . [ p2 ] ) to the second order in @xmath75",
    "we get @xmath76 where @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "thus , thermomagnetic coefficients in the fluctuation region are proportional to @xmath78 .    summarizing results of this section",
    ", we would like to note that the total heat current operator of the fluctuating pairs in the magnetic field , @xmath79 ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] may be considered as the gauge - invariant extension of the operator @xmath52 without @xmath1 .",
    "this is a key point , because the further calculations of diagrams in fig .",
    "2 are similar to that for noninteracting electrons ( fig .",
    "1 ) : the kinetic and magnetic terms in @xmath80 generate two diagrams , which cancel each other in the zeroth order in pha .    in the above calculations",
    "the interaction with the magnetic field has been included in the heat current .",
    "note that eq .",
    "[ bh ] can also be derived in another , more formal approach , where the magnetic field is initially included in electron states . without magnetic field ,",
    "the thermoelectric coefficient is described by the al diagram with the heat and electric current operators , @xmath62 and @xmath54 @xcite . in the magnetic field ,",
    "the momentum of the cooper pair is given by @xmath81 , and the polarization operator has a form : @xmath82 @xcite . calculating the thermomagnetic response , all blocks of the diagram",
    "should be expanded in @xmath83 .",
    "expanding polarization operators in the fluctuation propagators , we obtain the first diagram for the thermomagnetic coefficient @xcite . expanding the heat current block @xmath84",
    ", we immediately obtain the block @xmath53 , which forms the second diagram .",
    "this magnetic term has been lost in all previous works @xcite . using eq .",
    "10 as the heat current operator for fluctuating pairs , our results can be also obtained in tdgl formalism .",
    "to investigate a response of the electron system to @xmath85 , one can use the quantum transport equation .",
    "previously we adapted this method to calculations of the themoelectric and hall coefficients in gft @xcite . in this approach",
    "the electric current is given by @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the nonequilibrium correction to the fluctuation propagator .",
    "in the equilibrium , @xmath88 , where the keldysh component of the polarization operator @xmath89 at @xmath90 .    calculation of @xmath87 for the nernst coefficient is analogous to its calculation for the hall effect @xcite .",
    "the nonequilibrium effects are taken into account by the @xmath85 and @xmath1-poisson brackets between polarization operators : @xmath91 and @xmath92 $ ] , where @xmath93 and @xmath94 @xcite . therefore , the only difference in calculations of the hall and nernst coefficients is that the derivatives @xmath95 in hall coefficient ( @xmath96-poisson bracket @xcite ) should be replaced by the derivatives @xmath97 in the nernst coefficient .    to get the vector product @xmath98 ,",
    "the @xmath99-bracket should include the same polarization operator as the @xmath85-bracket .",
    "thus , in the first order in @xmath100 the nonequilibrium fluctuation propagator @xmath101 is described by the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "3 . finally ,",
    "calculating @xmath87 and the corresponding nernst current in the interior of the sample ( eq . [ je ] ) , we find @xmath102 where @xmath103 is equal to the term , which was calculated in the previous section from the onsager relation ( see eq .",
    "[ ett ] ) .",
    "thus , in the infinite sample or in the interior of the finite sample , the nernst coefficient consists of two terms .",
    "the second term in eq . [ ninf ] has the zeroth order in pha and violates the onsager relation .",
    "as it will be shown in the next section , in the finite sample this term is canceled by the contribution of the magnetization currents .",
    "the above results , eqs . [ ett ] and [ ninf ] , have been calculated for the infinite sample . referring to @xcite , recent works @xcite state that for a finite sample both coefficients should be corrected due to charge and heat transfer by surface magnetization currents . here",
    "we show that the magnetization currents contribute only to the charge transfer , and the results of @xcite have been misinterpreted .    the electric magnetization current @xmath104 in the potential relief @xmath105 transfers the energy flux @xmath106 ( eq .",
    "37 in @xcite ) . using @xmath107",
    ", we get @xmath108 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this term is erroneously attributed to the heat flux @xcite .",
    "as we discussed , the electric potential @xmath109 and the corresponding vertex @xmath110 do not contribute to the heat current , because the thermal energy should be counted from the electro - chemical potential .    in the interior of the sample the electric current consists of the transport and magnetization components , @xmath111 .",
    "the magnetization component is @xcite @xmath112 the magnetization currents are divergence - free .",
    "the total magnetization current through the sample cross - section must be zero , i.e. the bulk magnetization currents are canceled by the surface currents .",
    "therefore , the nernst coefficient measured in the finite sample is determined by the transport currents : @xmath113 $ ] @xcite .",
    "the nernst coefficient in the infinite sample ( eq . [ ninf ] ) is associated with the bulk current in the finite sample , @xmath114 $ ] . using eq .",
    "[ jem ] , we get @xmath115 } = \\delta n_{inf } - c { \\partial \\mu \\over \\partial t}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] taking into account eq .",
    "[ mu ] , we see that the second term in the last equation , @xmath116 , cancels completely the second term in @xmath117 ( eq . [ ninf ] ) .",
    "the rest is equal to @xmath103 , which satisfies the onsager relation @xmath118 .",
    "note that , if in contradiction to our results , the surface magnetization currents provide the heat transfer , this effect could be found in transport measurements . in the gorbino disc geometry with the magnetic field perpendicular to the disc and the circular inductive electric field in the plane ( fig .",
    "4 ) , the heat current in the radial direction does not contain the surface components , which were predicted for the standard parallelepiped geometry in @xcite . according to our results , both experiments will give the same results .",
    "the surface electric currents generated by @xmath85 are very significant ( see eq . [ jem ] ) .",
    "however , they can not be experimentally separated from the interior currents , because contrary to the circular electric field , the circular temperature gradient does not exist .",
    "this difference between @xmath119 and @xmath85 is reflected in the asymmetry of the nernst and ettingshausen coefficients calculated for the infinite sample .",
    "now we show that in the general case , the interelectron interaction can not change pha requirements for @xmath120 and @xmath13 , i.e. the thermomagnetic coefficients are always proportional to the square of pha .    assuming that electron scattering from impurities is the main mechanism of the momentum relaxation , it is easy to see @xcite that the magnetic field and temperature gradient enter into the transport equation formalism through the distribution functions of noninteracting electrons and the poison brackets .",
    "in fact , the terms proportional to @xmath121 can appear in three different ways @xcite : ( @xmath122 ) through the nernst nonequilibrium distribution function of noninteracting electrons , @xmath123 \\ ( { \\partial s / \\partial t})$ ] , ( @xmath124 ) through the @xmath1-poisson bracket that involves the nonequilibrium distribution function under the temperature gradient , @xmath125 , and , finally , ( @xmath126 ) due to double , @xmath127 and @xmath1 , poisson brackets .",
    "it is evident that @xmath122 and @xmath124-type terms have already includes the hall pha , which is proportional to @xmath128 .",
    "the @xmath126-type terms in the form of the double poisson brackets describe the al process , which has been investigated above .",
    "as we have seen , the al diagram gives the contribution in the zeroth order in pha , however , this contribution is canceled by the contribution of the surface magnetization currents .",
    "thus , we conclude that the interelectron interaction can provide many - body thermomagnetic effects only in the second order in pha .",
    "we have shown that the magnetic term in the hamiltonian of charged particles ( eq . [ energy ] ) should be associated with the thermal energy . the corresponding term in the heat current operator ( eq . [ energy ] )",
    "restores the gauge invariance and gives important contribution to the ettingshausen coefficient .",
    "we also found that the surface magnetization currents do not contribute to the heat current , but provide substantial contribution to the charge transfer in the nernst effect ( eq . [ ons1 ] ) .",
    "our gauge - invariant scheme gives the thermomagnetic coefficients that satisfy to the onsager relation ( see eqs .",
    "[ ons1 ] and [ ninf ] ) . in the general case of the fermi liquid with particle - hole excitations",
    ", we conclude that the measured thermomagnetic coefficients are always proportional to the square of pha .",
    "any interaction by itself , i.e. without changing the electron band structure or character of elementary excitations , can not provide large thermomagnetic effects .",
    "the developed approach has been applied to effects of superconducting fluctuations .",
    "we show that the gauge invariant form of the heat current operator of fluctuating pairs is @xmath129 .",
    "the second ( magnetic ) term missed in previous publications plays an important role : as in the case of noninteracting electrons , the corresponding diagram cancels completely the large , zeroth - order in pha term in the ettingshausen coefficient .",
    "we also show that the nernst coefficient in the infinite superconducting sample consists of an anomalously large , the zeroth order in pha term ( eg . [ ninf ] ) .",
    "however , in the finite sample , this term is cancelled by the the surface magnetization currents ( eq . [ ons1 ] ) and thermoelectric coefficients satisfy the onsager relation .",
    "our results for @xmath130 are different by a huge factor of @xmath131 from the previous works @xcite , which claim that the attractive interaction in the cooper channel provide thermomagnetic transport without pha at all .",
    "we can also easily rebuff this claim , if we just change a sign of the interaction constant and consider the repulsive interaction in the cooper channel .",
    "as known , in ordinary metallic films this interaction results in corrections to conductivity , which are a factor of @xmath132 smaller than the conductivity of noninterating electrons @xcite . if the statement of refs .",
    "@xcite is correct , the thermomagnetic effects in ordinary metals would be @xmath133 larger than predicted for noninteracting electrons .",
    "certainly this huge effect is not known .",
    "returning to the problem of high-@xmath5 superconductors , we should note that most of the models , including fluctuation exchange @xcite , cheap vortices @xcite , and preformed pairs @xcite , have treated the state with large nernst effect as natural extensions of gft . in the light of our results ,",
    "the concept of this specific state which continuously evolved from gft due to fluctuations and additional interactions is far from obvious . in this sense",
    ", the current work rather supports an idea of the nernst state as `` a thermodynamic phase in itself with characteristic properties specific to it as a fixed point , distinct from those of a normal metal '' @xcite .    using gft as an example",
    ", we have shown that the gauge - invariant form of the heat current is critical for description of the ettingshausen effect and that the surface currents are important for the nernst effect .",
    "all other models of thermomagnetic transport including vortex models should be reconsidered in accordance with the formalism developed above .",
    "we would like to acknowledge useful discussions with i. aleiner , a. larkin , d. livanov , a. varlamov , and i. ussishkin .",

    "the corresponding relation between @xmath157 and two - dimensional conductivity has an additional numeric factor of 2 .",
    "thus , calculating the ettingshausen coefficient of noninteracting electrons , we demonstrated that the magnetic field should be taken into account in the heat current vertex .",
    "the diagram with this magnetic vertex in the heat current cancels the basic diagrams in the zeroth order in pha .",

    "<S> a problem of the definition of the heat transported in thermomagnetic phenomena has been well realized in the late sixties , but not solved up to date . ignoring this problem </S>",
    "<S> , numerous recent theories grossly overestimate the thermomagnetic coefficients in strongly interacting systems . here </S>",
    "<S> we develop a gauge - invariant microscopic approach , which shows that the heat transfer should include the energy of the interaction between electrons and a magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate that the surface currents induced by the magnetic field transfer the charge in the nernst effect , but do not transfer the heat in the ettingshausen effect . only with these two modifications of the theory , </S>",
    "<S> the physically measurable thermomagnetic coefficients satisfy the onsager relation . </S>",
    "<S> we critically revised the gaussian fluctuation model above the superconducting transition and show that the gauge invariance uniquely relates thermomagnetic phenomena in the fermi liquid with the particle - hole asymmetry . </S>"
