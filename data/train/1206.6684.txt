    "it is worthwhile to remark that kaneyoshi s predictions were subsequently confirmed by jaur @xcite and dakhama @xcite when solving the ferrimagnetic version of the decorated ising model rigorously .",
    "the significance of this model also lies in the fact that temperature dependences of the total magnetization show numerous characteristic features not predicted in the standard nel theory of ferrimagnetism @xcite .",

    "further , the parameter @xmath13 stands for the uniaxial single - ion anisotropy acting on the spin-@xmath3 atoms only . as one can see from fig .",

    "even though the parameter @xmath53 does not have a direct physical meaning , it directly determines the overall thermodynamics of the spin-1/2 ising model on the bethe lattice in the limit @xmath54 . with the help of eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) , one may easily derive for @xmath55 that enters the magnetization formula ( [ eq12 ] ) the following recursion relation @xmath56 which can be regarded as the equation of state .",
    "the equation ( [ eq13 ] ) forms an iteration sequence and converges to stable fixed points in the thermodynamic limit for non - staggered phases . in our case",
    "this situation appears if the effective nearest - neighbour coupling of the corresponding spin-1/2 ising model on the bethe lattice is ferromagnetic ( i.e. @xmath40 ) . on the other hand , the recursion relation ( [ eq13 ] )",
    "leads to two - cycle double points in the case of staggered antiferromagnetic phase , which emerges in the corresponding spin-1/2 ising model on the bethe lattice provided that the effective interaction is antiferromagnetic ( i.e. @xmath41 ) @xcite . however , one may take advantage of the bipartite nature of the bethe lattice to overcome this difficulty under the simultaneous change of the nearest - neighbour interaction @xmath57 and the spins from each second generation @xmath58 .",
    "hence , it follows that the staggered magnetization ( [ eq8b ] ) may alternatively be calculated from the relevant exact result ( [ eq12 ] ) for the ferromagnetic spin-1/2 ising model on the bethe lattice with the effective interaction @xmath59 . in this way ,",
    "our exact calculation of all spontaneous sublattice magnetizations of the mixed - spin ising model on the decorated bethe lattice is completed , because it is now sufficient to substitute eqs .",

    "finally , let us examine in detail the critical and compensation behaviour of the model under investigation .",
    "it can be readily understood from the mapping relation ( [ eq7 ] ) between both partition functions that the mixed - spin ising model on the decorated bethe lattice may exhibit a critical point only if the corresponding spin-1/2 ising model on the undecorated bethe lattice is at a critical point as well .",
    "this result is taken to mean that the critical temperature of the mixed - spin ising model on the decorated bethe lattice can easily be obtained by comparing the effective nearest - neighbour coupling of the corresponding spin-1/2 ising model on the simple ( undecorated ) bethe lattice with its critical value @xmath64 .",
    "the critical condition for the the mixed - spin ising model on the decorated bethe lattice then reads @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 denotes the critical temperature and the plus ( minus ) sign applies when the effective coupling @xmath63 given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq5])-([eq6 ] ) is being positive ( negative ) .",
    "the sign ambiguity to emerge in the critical condition ( [ eqcc ] ) comes from the fact that the critical temperature of the spin-1/2 ising model on the undecorated bethe lattice remains the same independently of whether the effective interaction is being ferromagnetic ( @xmath40 ) or antiferromagnetic ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "it is worthy to notice , moreover , that the nearest - neighbour spin-1/2 ising atoms from the sublattice a should consequently exhibit ferromagnetic ( antiferromagnetic ) spin alignment in the phases delimited by critical phase boundaries ( [ eqcc ] ) with plus ( minus ) sign .",
    "last but not least , the compensation phenomenon may also come into play if the total magnetization of the mixed - spin ising model disappears at temperature(s ) below the critical point . to explore this effect ,",
    "let us therefore define the total magnetization per one spin @xmath68 , which is normalized with respect to its saturation value @xmath69 .",
    "in this respect , one easily finds the necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for an appearance of the compensation point(s ) @xmath70 whereas @xmath71 and @xmath0 labels the compensation temperature .",
    "it is quite obvious from eq .",
    "( [ eqco ] ) that the compensation point may possibly arise only in the ferrimagnetic model with the antiferromagnetic ( @xmath72 ) nearest - neighbour interaction between the spin-1/2 and spin-@xmath3 atoms .",
    "in addition , it also turns out from eq .",
    "( [ eqco ] ) that the compensation temperature does not apparently depend on a strength of the next - nearest - neighbour interaction @xmath12 between the spin-1/2 ising atoms , which merely determines a magnitude of the critical temperature according to eq .",
    "( [ eqcc ] ) .",
    "let us proceed to a discussion of the most interesting results . even though all the results derived in the foregoing section are valid for arbitrary value of the coordination number @xmath5 of the underlying bethe lattice , regardless of whether the interactions @xmath11 and @xmath12 are ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic and also irrespective of the value of the decorating spins , our further analysis will be henceforth restricted only to the particular case of the ferrimagnetic mixed spin-1/2 and spin-1 ising model on the decorated bethe lattice with a quite general coordination number @xmath5 , the antiferromagnetic @xmath73 nearest - neighbour interaction and either ferromagnetic @xmath74 or antiferromagnetic @xmath75 next - nearest - neighbour interaction .",
    "it is noteworthy that the investigated model displays all general features of ferrimagnetism found in the mixed spin-(1/2,@xmath3 ) ising models with the integer - valued decorating spins @xmath3 , while the respective behaviour of the mixed spin-(1/2,@xmath3 ) ising models with the half - odd - integer decorating spins @xmath3 is much less pronounced as convincingly evidenced in refs . @xcite and will be therefore postponed from the present study .",
    "note furthermore that exact results presented hereafter may also be confronted with several known rigorous results , which have been previously obtained for the mixed spin-1/2 and spin-1 ising ferrimagnets on the decorated planar lattices @xcite , or bethe lattices @xcite . to reduce the number of free parameters , all the interaction",
    "constants will be hereafter normalized with respect to a strength of the nearest - neighbour interaction @xmath76 , which means that the ratio @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 will accordingly measure a relative magnitude of the next - nearest - neighbour interaction , single - ion anisotropy and temperature , respectively .",
    "let us begin with the analysis of the ground state .",
    "the ground - state phase diagram of the mixed spin-1/2 and spin-@xmath80 ising ferrimagnet on the decorated bethe lattice of arbitrary coordination number @xmath5 is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in agreement with our expectations , the typical ferrimagnetic phase ( fi ) with the antiparallel alignment @xmath81 = [ 1/2 , -1]$ ] between the nearest - neighbour spin-1/2 and spin-1 atoms is being the ground state provided that a relative strength of the easy - plane ( negative ) single - ion anisotropy @xmath78 and/or the antiferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbour interaction @xmath77 is not too strong . on assumption that the next - nearest - neighbour interaction is being ferromagnetic ( @xmath82 ) , the decrease in the single - ion anisotropy causes a first - order phase transition from fi towards the remarkable ferromagnetic phase ( fii ) with the respective spin alignment @xmath81 = [ 1/2 , 0]$ ] . note that the spontaneous long - range order inherent to fii is merely kept by the ferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbour interaction between the spin-1/2 atoms , whereas all the spin-1 atoms are non - magnetic as a result of sufficiently strong easy - plane single - ion anisotropy ( @xmath83 ) that energetically favours the non - magnetic spin state @xmath84 before two magnetic ones @xmath85 .",
    "if one considers the antiferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbour interaction from the intermediate range @xmath86 , the antiferromagnetic phase ( afi ) characterized through a more complex spin arrangement @xmath87 = [ 1/2 , 0 ; -1/2 , 0]$ ] arises from fi upon lowering the single - ion anisotropy .",
    "all the decorating spin-1 atoms reside in afi the non - magnetic spin state @xmath84 quite similarly as in fii , but the spin-1/2 atoms from the nearest - neighbour shells of the decorated bethe lattice align antiparallel with respect to each other on account of the antiferromagnetic nature of the next - nearest - neighbour interaction being responsible for the symmetry breaking ( period doubling ) .",
    "it should be noted here that the emergence of both fii and afi is restricted to the parameter space with the easy - plane character of the single - ion anisotropy @xmath88 .",
    "considering the easy - axis single - ion anisotropy @xmath89 and reinforcing the antiferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbour interaction , the mixed - spin system undergoes at @xmath90 a first - order phase transition from fi towards the partially antiferromagnetically ordered and partially disordered phase ( afii ) characterized through the spin arrangement @xmath87 = [ 1/2 , \\pm 1 ; -1/2 , \\pm 1]$ ] . the peculiar coexistence of a partial order and a partial disorder in afii comes from the antiferromagnetic alignment of the next - nearest - neighbouring spin-1/2 atoms , which is simultaneously responsible for a unusual spin frustration of the decorating spin-1 atoms .",
    "hence , it follows that the spin-1 atoms reside in afii with the same probability one of its two magnetic spin states @xmath85 due to the easy - axis character of the single - ion anisotropy @xmath89 .",
    "it should be pointed out that the established ground - state phase diagram holds for the mixed - spin ising models on the decorated planar lattices as well .",
    "it surprisingly appears that the characterization of the phase fii has been notably overlooked in several previous approximative @xcite as well as exact @xcite studies on the mixed - spin ising model on decorated planar lattices .",
    "in addition , it seems that the particular case with the antiferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbour interaction has not been dealt with hitherto and hence , theoretical predictions of these two phases represent the completely new finding not reported in the literature yet .     ising model on the decorated bethe lattice in the @xmath91 plane .",

    "as one can see , the critical line approaches the zero - temperature phase boundary between fi and pp with a negative slope for the decorated bethe lattices with the coordination number @xmath95 , with a positive slope for the decorated bethe lattices with the coordination number @xmath96 and with an infinite gradient for the particular value of the coordination number @xmath97 .",
    "these observations would suggest that reentrant phase transitions can be observed in a close vicinity of the ground - state boundary between fi and pp for the decorated bethe lattices with a sufficiently high coordination number @xmath96 , whereas the reentrance becomes the more pronounced , the higher the coordination number @xmath5 of the underlying bethe lattice is .",

    "the spin system is disordered in the ground state , then it orders at a lower critical temperature to display the spin order inherent to fi , which finally disappears at the upper critical temperature ( pp - fi - pp reentrance ) . on the other hand , there are quite fundamental differences in the respective reentrant behaviour of the spin system with the antiferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbour interaction .",
    "first of all , the spin system exhibits a more striking reentrance with three consecutive critical points when starting from the spontaneously long - range ordered ground state , which either corresponds to afi or fi depending on an interplay between the single - ion anisotropy and the next - nearest - neighbour interaction .",
    "the spontaneous ordering of afi ( or fi ) disappears at the first critical temperature , then there appears pp in a relatively narrow region in between the first and second critical temperature , at which the spontaneous order of fi occurs ( or re - appears ) and finally vanishes at the third critical temperature .",
    "the observed reentrant phase transitions can be thus characterized by two following sequences of second - order phase transformations afi - pp - fi - pp and fi - pp - fi - pp .",
    "it can be also clearly seen from fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) that the reentrant region moves towards a more positive values of the single - ion anisotropy ( together with the ground - state boundary between fi and afi ) and it gradually vanishes upon strengthening the antiferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbour interaction .",
    "finally , the last couple of phase diagrams from fig . [ fig6 ] illustrates the effect of the ferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbour interaction on the critical behaviour of the mixed spin-1/2 and spin-1 ising model on the decorated bethe lattice with the coordination number @xmath104 .",
    "as one can see , the character of reentrant phase transitions substantially changes by taking the ferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbour interaction into consideration even although one still detects the reentrance with three consecutive critical points .",
    "however , the observed reentrant phase transition is basically different in that both low - temperature as well as high - temperature spontaneously long - range ordered phase is always fii .",
    "according to this , the spin system undergoes the following sequence of second - order phase transitions fii - pp - fii - pp when starting from the lowest and ending up at the highest temperature . to summarize , the only common feature of all three kinds of reentrant phase transitions fii - pp - fii - pp",
    ", fi - pp - fi - pp and afi - pp - fi - pp is that the reentrance is quite sensitive and easily diminishes by changing a relative strength of the next - nearest - neighbour interaction .     as a function of the single - ion anisotropy @xmath78 for several values of the ferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbour interaction @xmath102 .",

    "[ fig7]-[fig9 ] .",

    "the resultant magnetization exhibits for @xmath107 and @xmath108 the standard r - type dependence and the slightly deformed n - type dependence with one compensation point , respectively , whose unusual shape comes from a steeper temperature - induced decrease in the sublattice magnetization @xmath62 of the decorating spin-1 atoms . furthermore , fig .",
    "[ fig7](c ) shows temperature variations of the total and sublattice magnetizations exactly at the phase boundary between fi and fii . in agreement with this statement",
    ", the sublattice magnetization @xmath62 tends towards the intermediate value @xmath109 when approaching zero temperature , which indicates a coexistence of fi and fii in the ground state",
    ". finally , thermal dependences of the total and sublattice magnetizations displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig7](d ) provide an exact evidence of fii .    , the fixed value of the ferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbour interaction @xmath106 and four different values of the single - ion anisotropy : ( a ) @xmath110 ; ( b ) @xmath111 ; ( c ) @xmath105 ; ( b ) @xmath112.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=53.0% ] , the fixed value of the ferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbour interaction @xmath106 and four different values of the single - ion anisotropy : ( a ) @xmath110 ; ( b ) @xmath111 ; ( c ) @xmath105 ; ( b ) @xmath112.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=53.0% ] , the fixed value of the ferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbour interaction @xmath106 and four different values of the single - ion anisotropy : ( a ) @xmath110 ; ( b ) @xmath111 ; ( c ) @xmath105 ; ( b ) @xmath112.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=53.0% ] , the fixed value of the ferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbour interaction @xmath106 and four different values of the single - ion anisotropy : ( a ) @xmath110 ; ( b ) @xmath111 ; ( c ) @xmath105 ; ( b ) @xmath112.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=53.0% ]    as a matter of fact , the sublattice magnetization @xmath62 vanishes in the zero - temperature limit and its anomalous temperature - induced increase can be attributed to spin excitations from the non - magnetic spin state @xmath113 preferably towards the excited spin state @xmath114 . in the consequence of that , the resultant magnetization might display the striking w - type dependence with two successive compensation points not included in the standard nel theory of ferrimagnetism ( for the characterization of temperature dependences of the total magnetization see refs .",
    "the former compensation point appears owing to a higher number of the decorating spins ( the overall contribution of the sublattice magnetization @xmath62 to the total magnetization consequently exceeds the one of the sublattice magnetization @xmath60 provided that @xmath62 becomes sufficiently high ) , while the latter compensation point emerges as a result of more subtle character of the decorating spins with respect to thermal fluctuations ( the sublattice magnetization @xmath62 tends steeper to zero than the sublattice magnetization @xmath60 in a vicinity of the critical point ) .",
    "next , let us turn to thermal variations of the total and sublattice magnetizations of the mixed spin-1/2 and spin-1 ising model on the decorated bethe lattice with the coordination number @xmath97 and the antiferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbour interaction @xmath115 .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the antiferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbour interaction competes with the nearest - neighbour interaction and hence , the weaker easy - plane single - ion anisotropy is thus generally needed in order to destroy the spontaneous order of fi .",
    "however , one still detects temperature dependences of the total and sublattice magnetizations quite typical for fi whenever the single - ion anisotropy is selected above its critical value @xmath116 ( see fig . [ fig8](a ) ) .",
    "contrary to this , both spontaneous sublattice magnetizations equal zero for any single - ion anisotropy below this boundary value @xmath117 and the system surprisingly exhibits the unusual antiferromagnetic long - range order afi with the non - zero staggered magnetization of the spin-1/2 atoms as the relevant order parameter ( see fig . [ fig8](b ) ) .",
    "hence , it actually turns out that the spin-1/2 ising atoms from nearest - neighbour shells of the decorated bethe lattice align antiparallel with respect to each other due to the antiferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbour interaction and owing to this fact , the decorating spin-1 atoms become frustrated and all tend towards their non - magnetic spin state @xmath113 .    , the fixed value of the antiferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbour interaction @xmath115 and two different values of the single - ion anisotropy : ( a ) @xmath118 ; ( b ) @xmath105.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=53.0% ] , the fixed value of the antiferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbour interaction @xmath115 and two different values of the single - ion anisotropy : ( a ) @xmath118 ; ( b ) @xmath105.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=53.0% ]    for completeness , let us also confirm an existence of the reentrant phase transitions by analyzing thermal dependences of the spontaneous magnetization of the mixed spin-1/2 and spin-1 ising model on the decorated bethe lattice with the higher coordination number @xmath104 . for this purpose ,",

    "in this work , we have exactly calculated magnetic properties of the mixed spin-1/2 and spin-@xmath3 ising model on the decorated bethe lattice with a quite general coordination number @xmath5 when combining the decoration - iteration transformation with the exact recursion relations .",
    "the model hamiltonian includes the nearest - neighbour interaction between the spin-1/2 and spin-@xmath3 atoms , the next - nearest - neighbour interaction between the spin-1/2 atoms and the uniaxial single - ion anisotropy . by making use of the decoration - iteration transformation",
    ", we have established a precise mapping equivalence between the mixed spin-1/2 and spin-@xmath3 ising model on the decorated bethe lattice and its corresponding spin-1/2 ising model on the simple ( undecorated ) bethe lattice subsequently treated with the aid of exact recursion relations .",
    "furthermore , the rigorous mapping theorems and exact spin identities have been employed in order to get the precise results for both spontaneous sublattice magnetizations as well as staggered magnetization .",
    "our main attention was focused on magnetic properties of the mixed spin-1/2 and spin-1 ising ferrimagnet , which exhibits remarkably diverse critical behaviour and compensation phenomena .",
    "the four different phases have been found in the ground - state phase diagram , two of them have the uniform magnetization and another two staggered magnetization as the order parameter .",
    "in addition , it has been demonstrated that the investigated mixed - spin system may exhibit either reentrant phase transitions with two consecutive critical points ( for zero next - nearest - neighbour interaction ) or three different types of reentrant phase transitions with three successive critical points ( for non - zero next - nearest - neighbour interaction ) .",
    "it is worthy to recall that the reentrance may appear just for a sufficiently high coordination number @xmath96 of the underlying bethe lattice and this observation seems to be of a quite general validity as it has been already proved in the ising - heisenberg models on the diamond - like decorated bethe lattices @xcite .",
    "finally , it has been also illustrated that the next - nearest - neighbour interaction may cause a presence of one or two compensation points in the temperature dependence of the total magnetization .",
    "let us conclude our study by mentioning that the present formalism can be rather straightforwardly extended for the mixed spin-1/2 and spin-@xmath3 ising model on the decorated bethe lattices in a presence of the external magnetic field and this exactly soluble model might display a quite intriguing magnetization process including several non - trivial magnetization plateaus",
