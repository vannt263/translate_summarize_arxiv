    "high resolution x - ray diffraction measurements show that the average structure is cubic at least to 100  k , but reveal a large anisotropic microstrain broadening of the diffraction peaks possibly indicating an incipient structural transition ( see appendix  [ sec : s_xrd ] .",
    "further neutron and x - ray diffraction experiments that span the relevant temperature regime where the phase transition may occur are under way .",
    "while no deviations from cubic symmetry have been reported thus far , the particular low temperature structure we report resolves a number of inconsistencies in the literature .",
    "first , mssbauer spectroscopy consistently indicates two distinct fe sites @xcite .",
    "this has been ascribed to result from fe - sc site mixing at the level of 30  % @xcite , but seems an extremely unlikely scenario given the disparate ionic radii and charge of fe@xmath4 and sc@xmath47 , and is furthermore inconsistent with neutron diffraction , which offers excellent contrast between fe and sc .",
    "even at room temperature the mssbauer spectra necessitate a second fe site in small fractions and below @xmath950  k the quadrupolar splitting from each respective site diverges .",
    "these observations seem consistent with a thermally fluctuating , or dynamic , distortion which dramatically slows down below 50  k. second , optical measurements in the far infrared show signatures of symmetry breaking @xcite .",
