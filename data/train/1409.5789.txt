    "the study of quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) is an important subject in many - body quantum physics @xcite .",
    "if we consider a quantum system described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 have different symmetries and @xmath3 is a control parameter , qpt occurs when @xmath3 reaches a critical value @xmath4 for which the properties of the system change suddenly .    in this work",
    "we will analyze phase - space properties for a qpt and , for this purpose , we will consider the representative dicke model of spin - boson interactions ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there are several distributions to analyze phase - space properties @xcite ; the most popular one is the wigner distribution , but there is another important one , the husimi distribution , which has the interesting property of non - negativity and it is defined as the overlap between a minimal uncertainty ( coherent ) state and the wavefunction .",
    "recently , we have proposed the husimi distribution as a tool for a phase - space visualization of qpts using two algebraic models to exemplify the study : the dicke model @xcite and the vibron model @xcite , this last used to study rotational and vibrational spectra in diatomic and polyatomic molecules , which also exhibit a ( shape ) qpt . in ref .",
    "@xcite we made use of the holstein - primakoff approximation @xcite ( large spin @xmath5 ) to approximate the atomic sector by an harmonic oscillator for a large number of atoms @xmath6 . here we wo nt use this approximation and work with finite @xmath7 in an exact manner .",
    "the advantage of working in phase space is that we can analyze contributions in position and momentum space jointly .",
    "additionally , we have characterized qpts using the zeros of the husimi distribution .",
    "other information theoretic measures for qpt s in the dicke and vibron models have been recently studied in position and/or momentum spaces , separately . in particular",
    ", it has been shown that there is an abrupt change of the rnyi entropy @xcite , fisher information @xcite and complexity measures @xcite at the transition point in the dicke model .",
    "moreover , it has been found that uncertainty shannon @xcite and rnyi @xcite entropic relations accounts for the qpts better than other variance - based uncertainty relations .",
    "see also @xcite for a recent paper on vibration - rotation entanglement measures of vibron models in the ` rigidly bent ' phase .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following . in section [ sec1 ]",
    "we briefly remind the dicke model , boson and spin-@xmath5 coherent states and we present the husimi distribution ( without the holstein - primakoff approximation ) and the wehrl entropy . in section [ sec2 ] we will present numerical and variational results in terms of symmetry - adapted coherent states .",
    "three - dimensional plots , contour lines and wehrl entropy of the husimi distribution reveal a drastic change in the symmetry of the ground state wave function and provide a signature for the qpt even for a finite number of particles .",
    "finally , zeros of the husimi distribution ( in the variational approximation ) are also computed and graphically represented to characterize the qpt .",
    "the single - mode dicke model is a well studied object in the field of qpts @xcite . in this case",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath8 describing an ensemble of @xmath7 two - level atoms with level - splitting @xmath9 , with @xmath10 , @xmath11 the angular momentum operators for a pseudospin of length @xmath12 , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the bosonic operators of the field with frequency @xmath15 .",
    "it is well known that there is a qpt at the critical value of the coupling parameter @xmath16 from the so - called normal phase ( @xmath17 ) to the superradiant phase ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "let us consider a basis set @xmath19 of the hilbert space , with @xmath20 the number states of the field and @xmath21 the so called dicke states of the atomic sector .",
    "the matrix elements of the hamiltonian in this basis are : @xmath22 at this point it is important to note that time evolution preserves the parity @xmath23 of a given state @xmath24 .",
    "that is , the parity operator @xmath25 commutes with @xmath26 and both operators can then be jointly diagonalized",
    ". in particular , the ground state must be even ( see later on eq .",
    "( [ sacs ] ) ) .",
    "let us denote by @xmath27 ( with @xmath28 ) the standard ( canonical or glauber ) and spin-@xmath5 coherent states ( css ) for the photon and the particle sectors , respectively .",
    "it is well known ( see e.g. @xcite ) that coherent states form an overcomplete set of the corresponding hilbert space and fulfill the closure relations or resolutions of the identity : @xmath29 with @xmath30 ( or @xmath31 in polar coordinates @xmath32 ) the lebesgue measure on @xmath33 .",
    "the complex parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 are related to the mean number of photons , as @xmath36 , and the mean fraction of excited atoms , as @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "it is also straightforward to see that the probability amplitude of detecting @xmath38 photons and @xmath39 excited atoms in @xmath40 is given by : @xmath41 the ground state vector @xmath42 will be given as an expansion @xmath43 where the coefficients @xmath44 are calculated by numerical diagonalization of , with a given cutoff @xmath45 , and depend on the control parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the husimi distribution of @xmath42 is then given by @xmath46 and normalized according to : @xmath47 with integration measure : @xmath48 an important quantity to visualize the qpt in the dicke model across the critical point @xmath4 will be the wehrl entropy @xmath49 where the dependence of @xmath50 on @xmath3 comes from the dependence of @xmath44 on @xmath3 .",
    "in figure [ husimifig ] we represent a 3d plot of the exact husimi distribution of the ground state @xmath51 in ` position ' ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 real ) and ` momentum ' ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 imaginary ) spaces .",
    "we observe that the husimi distribution in position space is concentrated around @xmath52 at the normal phase @xmath17 ( no photons and no excited atoms ) but splits into two differentiated packets at the superradiant phase @xmath53 . in momentum space ,",

    "the exact values of @xmath59 for @xmath66 and @xmath67 are nicely reproduced by the following trial states expressed in terms of `` parity - symmetry - adapted '' css introduced by castaos et al .",
    "@xcite , which turn out to be an excellent approximation to the exact quantum solution of the ground ( + ) and first excited (  ) states of the dicke model .    using the direct product @xmath40 as a ground - state ansatz",
    ", one can easily compute the mean energy @xmath68 which defines a four - dimensional `` energy surface '' .",
    "minimizing with respect to these four coordinates gives the equilibrium points ( see @xcite ) : @xmath69 note that @xmath70 and @xmath71 are real and non - zero above the critical point @xmath4 ( i.e. , in the superradiant phase ) .",
    "although the direct product @xmath72 gives a good variational approximation to the ground state mean energy in the thermodynamic limit @xmath73 , it does not capture the correct behavior for other ground state properties sensitive to the parity symmetry @xmath74 of the hamiltonian ( [ qpt01 ] ) like , for instance , uncertainty and entropy measures @xcite .",
    "this is why parity - symmetry - adapted coherent states are introduced .",
    "indeed , a far better variational description of the ground ( resp .",

    "here @xmath78 is a normalization factor .",
    "these even and odd coherent states are `` schrdinger cat states '' in the sense that they are a quantum superposition of quasi - classical , macroscopically distinguishable states .",
    "the new energy surface @xmath79 ( see @xcite for an explicit expression of it ) is more involved than @xmath80 in and makes much more difficult to obtain the new critical points @xmath81 minimizing the corresponding energy surface . the reader is addressed to ref .",
    "@xcite in this volume for a numerical computation of the new critical points .",
    "it should be emphasized that the equilibrium points given in the expression are correct only in the thermodynamic limit @xmath73 or far from @xmath82 for finite @xmath5 .",
    "otherwise the minimization of @xmath83 should be done ( see @xcite for more details ) . in this paper , instead of carrying out a numerical computation of @xmath81 for different values of @xmath5 and @xmath3",
    ", we shall use the approximation @xmath84 , which turns out to be quite good except in a close neighborhood around @xmath4 , which diminishes as the number of particles @xmath6 increases ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . with this approximation",
    ", we expect a rather good agreement between our numerical and variational results except perhaps in a close vicinity of @xmath4 ( indeed , see figure [ wehrlfig ] ) .",

    "now , we have corroborated that the zeros of the husimi distribution evidence the qpt without the holstein - primakoff approximation , founding again that there are no zeros in the normal phase and a larger number of zeros as @xmath5 and @xmath3 increase in the superradiant phase .",
