    "the use of geometric - type techniques when dealing with linear dynamical systems , following a line of work initiated by basile and marro  @xcite and morse and wonham  @xcite , has provided important insights to system - theoretic and control - synthesis problems . in particular , this kind of techniques lead to elegant solutions to many control problems , such as the disturbance decoupling problem and the model matching problem , to quote but a few . to achieve this , a geometric approach , using",
    "certain linear spaces known as conditioned and controlled invariant spaces , has been developed ( see  @xcite and the references therein ) .    in the classical geometric approach to the theory of linear dynamical systems ,",
    "the scalars belong to a field , or at least to a ring . however , the case where the scalars belong to a semiring is also of practical interest .",
    "in particular , linear dynamical systems with coefficients in the max - plus or tropical semiring , and other similar algebraic structures sometimes referred to as `` dioids '' or `` idempotent semirings '' , arise in the modeling and analysis of some manufacturing systems following the approach initiated by cohen , dubois , quadrat and viot  @xcite ( a systematic account can be found in the book by baccelli , cohen , quadrat and olsder  @xcite ) .",
    "more recent developments of the max - plus approach include the `` network calculus '' of le boudec and thiran  @xcite , which can be used to assess certain issues concerning the quality of service in telecommunication networks , or an application to train networks by heidergott , olsder and van der woude  @xcite .",
    "all these works provide important examples of discrete event dynamical systems subject to synchronization constraints that can be described by max - plus linear dynamical systems .",
    "several results from linear system theory have been extended to the max - plus algebra framework , such as transfer series methods or the connection between spectral theory and stability questions ( see  @xcite ) . in view of the potentiality of the theory of linear dynamical systems over the max - plus semiring",
    ", it is also tempting to generalize the geometric approach to these systems , a problem which was raised by cohen , gaubert and quadrat in  @xcite .",
    "however , this generalization is not straightforward , because many concepts and results must be properly redefined and adapted .",
    "similar difficulties were already met in the case of linear dynamical systems over rings ( for which we refer to the works of hautus  @xcite and of conte and perdon  @xcite ) , and in the case of linear systems of infinite dimensions on hilbert spaces ( see for instance curtain  @xcite ) .",
    "the difficulties are in two directions . in the first place , there are algorithmic issues .",
    "the concepts of conditioned and controlled invariant subspaces ( or submodules ) are no longer dual , and the convergence of the algorithms of the geometric approach is not guaranteed .",
    "then , the computation of these spaces may be difficult or impossible in general . in the second place ,",
    "the connection between invariance and control or estimation problems is more difficult to establish .",
    "hypothesis must be added to overcome these problems .    in this paper , we show that some of the main results of the geometric approach do carry over to the max - plus case .",
    "a first work in this direction was developed by katz  @xcite , who studied the @xmath0-invariant spaces of max - plus linear systems providing solutions to some control problems .",
    "the max - plus analogue of the disturbance decoupling problem has been studied by lhommeau et al .",
    "@xcite making use of invariant sets in the spirit of the classical geometric approach .",
    "more precisely , principal ideal invariant sets were considered , which is an elegant solution to the algorithmic issues , leading to effective algorithms at the price of a restrictive assumption .",
    "however , these works differ from  @xcite in the fact that they are based on residuation theory and transfer series techniques .    the present paper is devoted to studying the max - plus analogues of conditioned and controlled invariance and the duality between them . in the classical linear system theory , conditioned invariant spaces are defined in terms of the kernel of the output matrix . in the semiring case , the usual definition of the kernel of a matrix is not pertinent because it is usually trivial . in their places ,",
    "we consider a natural extension of kernels , the congruences , which are equivalence relations with a semimodule structure ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "instead of considering , for instance , situations in which the perturbed state @xmath1 of the system is the sum of the unperturbed state @xmath2 and of a noise @xmath3 , we require the states @xmath2 and @xmath1 to belong to the same equivalence class modulo a relation ( congruence ) which represents the perturbation . indeed , in the max - plus setting , considering only additive perturbations would be an important restriction , because adding only means delaying events , whereas congruences allow us to model situations in which the perturbation drives some events to occur at an earlier time .    by a systematic application of these ideas , we generalize the main notions of the classical geometric approach .",
    "however , this generalization raises new theoretical as well as algorithmic issues , because we have to work with congruences ( sets of pairs of vectors ) , rather than with linear spaces ( sets of vectors ) , leading to a general `` doubling '' of the dimension .    considering max - plus linear systems subject to perturbations",
    "modeled by congruences actually leads to an extension of the modeling power of the max - plus approach , allowing one to take certain classes of constraints or uncertainties into account .",
    "for instance , we show that max - plus linear dynamical systems with uncertain holding times can be modeled in this way , if these times are assumed to belong to certain intervals . for this kind of perturbed systems ,",
    "the minimal conditioned invariant space containing the perturbation can be interpreted as the `` best information '' that can be learned on the state of the system from a given observation and initial state .",
    "our final result ( theorem  [ theoobserver ] ) shows that this `` optimal information '' on the perturbed state of the system can be reconstructed from the output by means of a dynamic observer .    in order to compute this dynamic observer",
    ", we extend to the max - plus algebra framework the classical fixed point algorithms used to compute the minimal conditioned invariant and the maximal controlled invariant spaces containing and contained , respectively , in a given space .",
    "our main result , theorem  [ theocondcontr ] , establishes a duality between conditioned and controlled invariant spaces .",
    "this allows us to reduce the computation of minimal conditioned invariant spaces to the computation of maximal controlled invariant spaces , and in this way to reduce algorithmic problems concerning congruences to algorithmic problems concerning semimodules , which are easier to handle .",
    "thus , this duality theorem solves the previously mentioned algorithmic difficulties related to the `` doubling '' of the dimension .",
    "then , proposition  [ propfinitevolume ] identifies conditions which guarantee that the fixed point algorithm used to compute the minimal conditioned invariant congruence containing a given congruence terminates in a finite number of steps .",
    "its proof is based on a finite chain condition , which is valid thanks to the finiteness and integrity assumptions made in the proposition .",
    "under more general circumstances , the max - plus case shows difficulties which seem somehow reminiscent of the ones encountered in the theory of invariant spaces for linear systems over non - noetherian rings .",
    "recall that the computation of such spaces is still an open problem in the case of general rings .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section is devoted to recalling basic definitions and results on max - plus algebra which will be used throughout this paper . in section  [ scondcont ]",
    "we introduce the max - plus analogues of conditioned and controlled invariant spaces and extend to the max - plus algebra framework the classical fixed point algorithms used for their computation .",
    "duality between conditioned and controlled invariance is investigated in section  [ sduality ] but previously , in section  [ sorthogonal ] , it is convenient to introduce the notions of orthogonal of semimodules and congruences and study their properties .",
    "finally , in section  [ sapplication ] , we illustrate the results presented here with their application to a manufacturing system .",
    "the max - plus semiring , @xmath4 , is the set @xmath5 equipped with the addition @xmath6 and the multiplication @xmath7 . to emphasize the semiring structure , we write @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    for @xmath10 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath11 the set of all @xmath12 times @xmath13 matrices over the max - plus semiring . as usual ,",
    "if @xmath14 , @xmath15 denotes the element of @xmath16 in its @xmath17-th row and @xmath18-th column , and @xmath19 the transposed of @xmath16 .",
    "the semiring operations are extended in the natural way to matrices over the max - plus semiring : @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 for all @xmath23 , where @xmath16 and @xmath24 are matrices of compatible dimension and @xmath25 . for @xmath14 , we denote by @xmath26 the image of @xmath16 .",
    "we usually denote by @xmath27 the neutral element for addition as well as the null matrix of any dimension .",
    "we equip @xmath4 with the usual topology which can be defined by the metric : @xmath28 .",
    "the cartesian product @xmath29 is equipped with the product topology .",
    "note that the semiring operations are continuous with respect to this topology .",
    "the analogues of vector spaces or modules obtained by replacing the field or ring of scalars by an idempotent semiring are called _ semimodules _ or _",
    "idempotent spaces_. they have been studied by several authors with different motivations ( see for example  @xcite ) . here",

    "we denote by @xmath34 the smallest semimodule containing a subset @xmath35 of @xmath29 .",

    "a semimodule @xmath30 is said to be finitely generated , if there exists a finite set @xmath35 such that @xmath36 , which also means that @xmath37 for some matrix @xmath16 .",

    "hence , the dynamics in   is multi - valued , meaning that several values of @xmath60 are compatible with a given @xmath61 .",
    "we assume that the output @xmath62 is observed .",
    "if @xmath63 for some matrix @xmath16 , then @xmath64 is equivalent to @xmath65 , so @xmath66 may be interpreted as an invariant which must be preserved by the perturbation .",
