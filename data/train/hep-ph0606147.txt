    "the degree to which the constituents of a quark - gluon plasma can combine to form composite entities is an important property of the plasma .",
    "it has significant implications on the plasma equation of state , the probability of recombination of plasma constituents prior to the phase transition , and the chemical yields of the observed hadrons .",
    "recent spectral analyses of quarkonium correlators indicated that @xmath1 may be bound up to 1.6@xmath3 where @xmath3 is the phase transition temperature @xcite .",
    "subsequently , there has been renewed interest in quarkonium states in quark - gluon plasma as zahed and shuryak suggested that @xmath5 states with light quarks may be bound up to a few @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "quarkonium bound states and instanton molecules in the quark - gluon plasma have been considered by brown , lee , rho , and shuryak @xcite . as heavy quarkonia",
    "may be used as diagnostic tools @xcite , there have been many recent investigations on the stability of heavy quarkonia in the plasma @xcite .",
    "previously , detar @xcite , hansson , lee , and zahed @xcite , and simonov @xcite observed that the range of the strong interaction is not likely to change drastically across the phase transition and suggested the possible existence of relatively narrow low - lying @xmath0 states in the plasma . on the other hand , hatsuda and",
    "kunihiro @xcite considered the persistence of soft modes in the plasma which may manifest themselves as pion - like and sigma - like states .",
    "the use of the baryon - strangeness correlation and the charge fluctuation to study the abundance of light quarkonium states in the plasma have been suggested recently @xcite .",
    "we would like to use the potential model to investigate the composite properties of the plasma and to determine its ` quark drip lines ' . here",
    "we follow werner and wheeler @xcite and use the term ` drip line ' to separate the region of bound color - singlet @xmath0 states from the unbound region of spontaneous quarkonium dissociation .",
    "it should be emphasized that a quarkonium can be dissociated by collision with constituent particles to lead to the corresponding ` thermal - dissociation line ' and ` particle - dissociation line ' , which can be interesting subjects for future investigations .",
    "the most important physical quantity in the potential model is the @xmath6-@xmath7 potential between the quark @xmath6 and the antiquark @xmath8 in a color - sinbglet state .",
    "previous works in the potential model use the color - singlet free energy @xmath9 @xcite or the color - singlet internal energy @xmath10 @xcite obtained in lattice gauge calculations as the color - singlet @xmath6-@xmath8 potential without rigorous theoretical justifications .",
    "the internal energy @xmath10 is significantly deeper and spatially more extended than the free energy @xmath9 . treating the internal energy @xmath10 as the @xmath6-@xmath7 potential led shuryak and zahed to suggest the possibility of bound color - singlet quarkonium states with light quarks in the plasma @xcite .",
    "the conclusions will be quite different if one uses the free energy @xmath9 as the @xmath6-@xmath7 potential .    while @xmath9 or @xmath10 can both be used as the @xmath6-@xmath7 potential at @xmath11 ( at which @xmath12 ) ,",
    "the situation is not so clear in a thermalized quark - gluon plasma . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we show that the equation of motion for the @xmath5 state can be obtained in two steps . first , one considers a lattice gauge calculation for a static pair of color - singlet @xmath6 and @xmath7 at a fixed separation @xmath13 at the temperature @xmath14 and obtains the free energy @xmath15 , the internal energy @xmath16 , and their difference @xmath17 . in the second step ,",
    "one considers a @xmath6 and a @xmath7 in dynamical motion in the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the dynamical degrees of freedom can be taken to be the set of quarkonium and plasma constituent wave functions and their corresponding state occupation numbers .",
    "the equilibrium of such a thermalized system at a fixed temperature and volume occurs when the grand potential is a minimum .",
    "one explicitly writes out the grand potential , which is the sum of the free energy and appropriate lagrange multiplier terms , in terms of the quarkonium and plasma constituent wave functions , the state occupation numbers , and the mutual @xmath6-@xmath7 , @xmath6-(constituent ) , @xmath8-(constituent ) , and ( constituent)-(constituent ) interactions .",
    "the minimization of the grand potential with respect to a color - singlet quarkonium wave function leads to the schr \" odinger equation for the quarkonium state with a color - singlet potential @xmath18 containing only @xmath6-@xmath7 , @xmath6-(constituent ) , and @xmath8-(constituent ) interactions . on the other hand ,",
    "the internal energy @xmath10 in the lattice gauge calculation contains not only contributions from these @xmath6-@xmath7 , @xmath6-(constituent ) , and @xmath7-(constituent ) interactions , but also an additional contribution from the ( constituent)-(constituent ) interaction .",
    "therefore , the color - singlet potential @xmath18 is determined by the internal energy @xmath10 after subtracting out the quark - gluon plasma internal energy .",
    "these results are further supported by the presence of a similar relationship between the total internal energy and the @xmath6-@xmath7 potential in the analogous case of debye screening , for which analytical expressions for various thermodynamical quantities can be readily obtained and compared @xcite .",
    "in order to subtract out the @xmath13-dependent internal energy of the quark - gluon plasma from the total internal energy to obtain the color - singlet @xmath6-@xmath7 potential in the plasma , additional lattice gauge calculations may be needed to evaluate the quark - gluon plasma internal energy in the presence of a color - singlet @xmath6 and @xmath7 pair .",
    "it is nonetheless useful at this stage to suggest approximate ways to evaluate this quark - gluon plasma internal energy .",
    "the subtraction can be carried out by noting that the quark - gluon plasma internal energy density @xmath19 is related to its pressure @xmath20 and entropy density @xmath21 by the first law of thermodynamics , @xmath22 , and the quark - gluon plasma pressure @xmath20 is also related to the plasma energy density @xmath19 by the equation of state @xmath23 that is presumed known by another independent lattice gauge calculation .",
    "thus , by expressing @xmath20 as @xmath24 with the ratio @xmath25 given by the known equation of state , the plasma internal energy density @xmath19 is related to the entropy density @xmath26 by @xmath27t\\sigma$ ] , and the plasma internal energy integrated over the volume is given by @xmath28ts_1 $ ] where @xmath29 has already been obtained as @xmath30 .",
    "the proper @xmath6-@xmath7 potential , @xmath18 , as determined from @xmath10 by subtracting the plasma internal energy ( which is equal to @xmath28(u_1-f_1)$ ] ) , is then a linear combination of @xmath9 and @xmath10 given by @xcite , @xmath31 the potential @xmath18 is approximately @xmath9 near @xmath3 and @xmath32 for @xmath33 @xcite .    in the spectral function analyses , the widths of",
    "many color - singlet heavy quarkonium broaden suddenly at various temperatures @xcite . in the most precise calculations for @xmath1 in quenched qcd using up to 128 time - like lattice slices",
    ", the spectrum has a sharp peak for @xmath34 and a broad structure with no sharp peak for @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the spectral peak at the bound state has the same structure and shape at 0.78@xmath3 as it is at @xmath36 .",
    "if one can infer that @xmath1 is stable and bound at 0.78@xmath3 , then it would be reasonable to infer that @xmath1 is also bound and stable at 1.62@xmath3 .",
    "the spectral function at @xmath37@xmath3 has the same structure and shape as the spectral function at 2.33@xmath3 . if one can infer that @xmath1 is unbound at 2.33@xmath3 , then it would be reasonable to infer that @xmath1 become already unbound at 1.70 @xmath3 .",
    "thus , from the shape of the spectral functions , the temperature at which the @xmath1 width broadens suddenly from 1.62@xmath3 to @xmath38 corresponds to the @xmath1 spontaneous dissociation temperature .",
    "dissociation temperatures for @xmath39 and @xmath2 in spectral analyses in quenched qcd have also been obtained @xcite .",

    ", we may be advised that non - relativistic potential models should not be used to describe light quarkonia . however , due to its strong interaction with other constituents , a light quark becomes a dressed quasiparticle and acquires a large quasiparticle mass . in the low temperature region when spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking occurs with @xmath89 , the quasiparticle mass is @xmath90+(current quark mass ) ] , where @xmath91 is the strong coupling constant and @xmath92 the quark condensate @xcite .",

    "the quasiparticle mass is @xmath93 , which is of the order of a few hundred mev @xcite .",
    "as the restoration of chiral symmetry is a second order transition , @xmath94 decreases gradually as the temperature increases beyond @xmath3 .",
    "the light quark quasiparticle mass associated with @xmath95 will likewise decrease gradually from the constituent - quark mass to the current - quark mass when the temperature increases beyond @xmath3 .",
    "this tendency for the quasiparticle mass to decrease will be counterbalanced by the opposite tendency for the quasiparticle ` thermal mass ' to increase with increasing temperature . in the region of our interest , @xmath96 ,",
    "various estimates give the light quark quasiparticle masses from 0.3 gev to 1.2 gev @xcite . as in the case of @xmath11 , where light quarks with a constituent - quark mass of about 350 mev mimic the effects of chiral symmetry breaking and non - relativistic constituent quark models have been successfully used for light hadron spectroscopy @xcite ,",
    "so the large estimated quasiparticle mass ( from 0.3 to 1.2 gev ) may allow the use of a non - relativistic potential model as an effective tool to estimate the stability of light quarkonia at @xmath96 . at this stage when the uncertainties in the quasiparticle mass are much greater than the effects due to relativistic kinematics , an estimate based on a non - relativistic model suffices .",

    ", we can estimate that as a quarkonium with light quarks has a reduced mass of 0.15 - 0.2 gev , it may be bound at temperatures below @xmath98 .",
    "an open heavy quarkonium with a light quark and a heavy antiquark has a reduced mass of about 0.3 - 0.4 gev and may be bound at temperatures below @xmath99 .",
