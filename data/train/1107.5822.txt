    "the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite , or more generally gauge / gravity duality , sets up a holographic duality between a weakly - coupled theory of gravity in certain spacetime and a strongly - coupled field theory living on the boundary of the spacetime .",
    "thus gauge / gravity duality provides a powerful new tool for studying strongly - coupled , scale - invariant field theories at finite charge density .",
    "hence one expects that this paradigm may be useful in condensed matter physics , such as in understanding systems near quantum criticality  @xcite .",
    "actually the correspondence between gravity theories and condensed matter physics ( sometimes is also named as ads / cmt correspondence ) has shed light on studying physics in the real world in the context of holography .",
    "the simplest laboratory for studying the ads / cmt correspondence is reissner - nordstrm - ads(rn - ads ) black hole in four - dimensional spacetime .",
    "the main reason why we consider such a background is that realistic condensed matter systems always contain a finite charge density , which should be mapped into charged ads black holes in the gravity side according to gauge / gravity dictionary .",
    "this laboratory has proven to be very efficient , for instance , investigations of the fermionic two - point functions in this background indicate the existence of fermionic quasi - particles with non - fermi liquid behavior  @xcite , while the @xmath7 symmetry of the extremal rn - ads black hole is crucial to the emergent scaling symmetry at zero temperature  @xcite . moreover , adding a charged scalar in such a background leads to superconductivity  @xcite .    a further step towards a holographic model - building of strongly - coupled systems at finite charge density is to consider the leading relevant ( scalar ) operator in the field theory side , whose bulk gravity theory is an einstein - maxwell - dilaton system with a scalar potential .",
    "such theories at zero charge density were analyzed in detail in recent years as they mimic certain essential properties of qcd  @xcite .",
    "solutions at finite charge density have been considered in  @xcite in the context of ads / cmt correspondence .",
    "recently a general framework for the discussion of the holographic dynamics of einstein - maxwell - dilaton systems with a scalar potential was proposed in  @xcite , which was a phenomenological approach based on the concept of effective holographic theory ( eht ) .",
    "the minimal set of bulk fields contains the metric @xmath8 , the gauge field @xmath9 and the scalar @xmath10 ( dual to the relevant operator ) .",
    "@xmath10 appears in two scalar functions that enter the effective action : the scalar potential and the non - minimal maxwell coupling .",
    "the main advantage of this eht approach is that it permits a parametrization of large classes of ir dynamics and allows investigations on important observables .",
    "however , compared to models arising from string theory , the main disadvantage is that it is not clear whether concrete ehts have explicit string theory embeddings , thus the corresponding field theories are less understood . despite of its disadvantage , the eht is an effective method towards holographic model building of condensed matter systems . for subsequent generalizations",
    "see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will review our works on a holographic model of strange metals , which were reported in  @xcite .",
    "thermodynamic and transport properties of strange metal phases , which have been observed in e.g. heavy fermion compounds and high temperature superconductors , are of particular interest in condensed matter physics . some novel features of ` strange metal ' phases can be summarized as follows :    * the dc resistivity is linear in temperature @xmath11 with @xmath11 much less than the chemical potential @xmath12 . *",
    "the ac conductivity behaves like @xmath13 with @xmath14 . *",
    "the hall conductivity also exhibits an anomalous behavior @xmath15 .",
    "however , such puzzling behaviors are still less understood even at the theoretical level .",
    "recently a holographic model which can partly describe the above mentioned features of ` strange metal ' phases was proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the background geometry was chosen to be a four - dimensional asymptotic lifshitz black hole , @xmath16 which possesses the following lifshitz scaling symmetry @xmath17 when @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the dynamical exponent . in their settings",
    "the role of charge carriers was played by probe d - branes , whose dynamics can be described by the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) action .",
    "the main results were promising in some sense , as the dc resistivity and ac conductivity turned out to be @xmath20 comparing with experimental data @xmath21 it can be seen that the holographic calculations agree with the experimental data at @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively but not simultaneously .",
    "furthermore , the hall conductivity took the following form @xmath24 which mimic the drude s theory rather than the strange metallic behavior .",
    "however , as pointed out in  @xcite , considering a background with non - trivial dilaton field may lead to more realistic model building for holographic strange metals .",
    "actually in  @xcite the authors considered various exact solutions in einstein - maxwell - dilaton theory and characterized strange metallic behaviors by calculating the corresponding dc resistivity and ac conductivity . in our papers  @xcite and  @xcite , we investigated strange metallic behaviors in four - dimensional anisotropic black hole background , which is an exact solution in einstein - maxwell - dilaton theory with a liouville type potential . in  @xcite we obtained the dc conductivity and ac conductivity by considering fluctuation of the @xmath25 component of the bulk gauge field and classified the behaviors of the conductivity in different parameter regimes .",
    "in  @xcite we calculated conductivities induced by probe d - branes in such background and by carefully choosing the parameters , we realized the dc resistivity and ac conductivity for strange metals simultaneously .",
    "in addition , it should be pointed out that in  @xcite , a quadratic temperature dependence of the inverse hall angle in the presence of both electric and magnetic fields was obtained by considering probe d7-branes in light - cone ads black hole backgrounds .",
    "the rest of the review is organized as follows : in section 2 we introduce the anisotropic solution which is our playground .",
    "then we calculate the dc and ac conductivities originating from fluctuations of the bulk gauge field in section 3 .",
    "the dc conductivity , ac conductivity and dc hall conductivity induced by probe d - branes are obtained in section 4 .",
    "a summary will be presented in section 5 .",
    "we start with the following action @xmath26,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 and @xmath27 represent the dilaton field and its potential .",
    "notice that the non - trivial dilaton coupling in front of the maxwell term may result in meaningful consequences .",
    "the equations of motion are given by @xmath28 now , we fix the dilaton potential to be of the liouville type @xmath29 .",
    "when @xmath30 , this potential reduces to a cosmological constant and the corresponding solution was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to solve the equations of motion , we use the following ansatz which leads to a zero temperature solution @xmath31",
    "with @xmath32 if we turn on the time component of the gauge field @xmath33 only , the gauge field strength can be read off from the equation of motion @xmath34 then we can fix the remaining parameters in the ansatz as follows by solving the equations of motion @xmath35 notice that @xmath36 in  ( [ 2eq8 ] ) is always smaller than @xmath37 .",
    "it can be seen that the above exact solution can reduce to various known solutions in different limits .",
    "for example , when @xmath30 and @xmath38 it reduces to the one obtained in ref .",
    "when @xmath39 , the above solution becomes @xmath40 .",
    "furthermore , if we take the limit @xmath41 and at the same time set @xmath42 , we can obtain @xmath43 geometry . finally , when @xmath44 is proportional to @xmath45 , say @xmath46 , the metric in the limit @xmath47 reduces to a lifshitz - like one  @xcite @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "the exponent @xmath19 is given by @xmath50 for @xmath51 and @xmath52 for @xmath53 , etc .",
    "the above zero temperature solution can be easily extended to a finite - temperature one describing a black hole . with the same parameters in  ( [ 2eq8 ] ) ,",
    "the black hole solution becomes @xmath54 with @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the black hole horizon .",
    "note that the @xmath0 charge is not explicitly shown in the metric components .",
    "the hawking temperature of this black hole is given by @xmath57",
    "as reviewed in the introduction , the dc and ac conductivities are observables which characterize strange metallic behaviors .",
    "thus it is desirable to work out the conductivities in the dual gravity background .",
    "generally , the conductivities can be evaluated in two complementary approaches . in this section",
    "we will focus on the first approach , that is , we consider fluctuations of the @xmath25 component of the gauge field and calculate the conductivities via kubo s formula , where the effective action for the fluctuations is described by the conventional maxwell term .",
    "the other approach , which involves @xmath0 gauge fields on probe d - branes in the dual background , will be considered in the next section .    for convenience ,",
    "we introduce new coordinate variable @xmath58 .",
    "then , the metric  ( [ 2eq10 ] ) becomes @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61      it can be seen that once we turn on the gauge field fluctuation @xmath62 , the metric fluctuations @xmath63 and @xmath64 are also involved .",
    "however , the corresponding equations for the fluctuations can be simplified in the gauge @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "consider the maxwell action @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a nontrivial coupling function and the following ansatz @xmath69 the equation of motion for @xmath62 @xmath70 becomes @xmath71 moreover , the @xmath72-component of the einstein equation is given by @xmath73    combining the above two equations , we can obtain @xmath74 next we introduce the following new variables @xmath75 ( [ 2eq15 ] ) simply reduces to a schrdinger - type equation @xmath76 with the effective potential given by @xmath77 where the prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath78 .",
    "one can express @xmath78 in terms of @xmath79 by simply reversing the first equation in  ( [ 2eq16 ] ) . here",
    "we will concentrate on the case @xmath80 , in which @xmath78 is given by @xmath81 similarly the black hole horizon @xmath82 can be written as @xmath83 therefore in @xmath78-coordinate the boundary ( @xmath84 ) is located at @xmath85 and the zero temperature limit corresponds to setting the black hole horizon to @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "we first consider the zero temperature case , in which @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the effective potential  ( [ 2eq17 ] ) reduces to @xmath90 furthermore , the above effective potential can be written in terms of the @xmath78 coordinate @xmath91 with a constant @xmath92 @xmath93 } { ( 16 + 4\\alpha^2 + 4 \\alpha \\eta - 3 \\eta^2)^2}.\\ ] ]    the exact solution @xmath94 to the schrdinger equation can be expressed in terms of the @xmath95-th kind of hankel function @xmath96 @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are constants and @xmath100 by imposing the incoming boundary condition at the horizon ( @xmath86 ) , we can pick up the solution with @xmath101 .",
    "then the asymptotic expansion of the solution near the boundary becomes @xmath102 with @xmath103 then we can obtain the solution for @xmath62 from  ( [ 2eq16 ] ) and extract the retarded green s function @xmath104 from the boundary action  @xcite .",
    "finally the ac conductivity is given by kubo s formula @xmath105 for the dc conductivity we should set @xmath106 .",
    "then the dc conductivity of this system becomes infinity when @xmath107 or zero when @xmath108 .",
    "as reviewed in the introduction , if we choose @xmath109 .",
    "the ac conductivity agrees with that of strange metals .",
    "notice that since there are two free parameters , @xmath45 and @xmath44 , when @xmath110 we can find infinite many pairs of the parameters @xmath111 which give @xmath112 and satisfy the regularity condition @xmath113 , such as @xmath114 .",
    "the calculations in the finite temperature background can be performed in a similar way . at the horizon , the dominant term in the effective potential  ( [ 2eq17])is given by @xmath115 where @xmath116 denotes the value of @xmath117 at the horizon .",
    "then we can obtain the approximate solution @xmath118 where @xmath119 furthermore we can set @xmath101 by imposing the incoming boundary condition again .",
    "now , we investigate the asymptotic behavior of @xmath94 . since the leading behavior of the effective potential near the boundary is given by  ( [ 2eq18 ] ) , the perturbative solution is @xmath120 where @xmath121 has been defined in  ( [ 2eq19 ] ) .",
    "the subsequent calculations are more or less the same as the zero temperature case , but it should be pointed out that here we have made use of numerical techniques .",
    "finally the ac conductivity at finite temperature reads @xmath122 \\frac { d_2 } { d_1 [ ( 2 a_1 - 1 ) a_0 ^ 2 ] ^{2 \\delta } } , \\ ] ] where the last factor @xmath123^{2 \\delta}}$ ] can be numerically obtained by solving the schrdinger equation together with the initial data at the horizon .",
    "the real and imaginary part of the ac conductivity are plotted in figure  [ pic1 ] .    , @xmath124 and @xmath110.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] , @xmath124 and @xmath110.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] +    we can fit the dual ac conductivity in figure [ pic1 ] with the following expected form @xmath125",
    "if we choose @xmath126 , @xmath124 and @xmath110 for the simple numerical calculation , the conductivity can be fitted by  ( [ 2eq20 ] ) with @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "we will consider the effect of an extra @xmath0 gauge field in this subsection . note that although the maxwell coupling is trivial in this case , we can find various different behaviors for the conductivities due to the free parameters in the theory .",
    "for later convenience , we introduce a different radial coordinate @xmath129 .",

    "we take the following ansatz for the worldvolume @xmath0 gauge field @xmath262 following  @xcite , we can finally arrive at the dc conductivity @xmath263 there exist two terms in the square root .",
    "one may interpret the first term as arising from thermally produced pairs of charge carriers , though here it has some non - trivial dependence on @xmath264 .",
    "it is expected that such a term should be suppressed when the charge carriers have large mass .",
    "then the surviving term gives @xmath265 by combining  ( [ 3eq4 ] ) , one can obtain the power - law for the dc resistivity , @xmath266 where we take the limit @xmath267 so that @xmath268 . note that when the parameter @xmath44 in the liouville potential is zero , the background reduces to a lifshitz - like solution at finite temperature with @xmath269 and @xmath270 .",
    "thus we have @xmath271 , which agrees with the result obtained in  @xcite .",
    "as reviewed in previous subsection , similarly here we can calculate the hall conductivity in our anisotropic background . here",
    "we take the following ansatz for the worldvolume @xmath0 gauge fields @xmath272 following  @xcite we can finally obtain @xmath273 and @xmath274 here are some remarks on the results for the conductivity tensor .",
    "* when both @xmath228 and @xmath275 are small , the hall conductivity becomes @xmath276 .",
    "once we take @xmath30 in the liouville potential , we have @xmath269 and therefore @xmath277 .",
    "note that @xmath278 , so we recover the result obtained in  @xcite @xmath279 . *",
    "the expression for @xmath280 reduces to the one obtained in previous subsection when @xmath281 .",
    "furthermore , when the second term in the square root dominates , and @xmath228 is small , we reproduce the result @xmath282 where @xmath283 .",
    "* one interesting quantity for studying the strange metals is the ratio @xmath284 .",
    "when the first term in the square root of @xmath280 is subdominant , one can easily obtain the following result @xmath285 in the @xmath30 limit , @xmath286 , we have @xmath287 * the strange metals exhibit the following anomalous behaviors : @xmath288 .",
    "in contrast , @xmath289 in drude theory . since @xmath290 in the limit of @xmath30 ,",
    "our result can mimic drude theory in this limit , which agrees with the result in  @xcite .",
    "the ac conductivity can be calculated by considering the fluctuations of the probe gauge fields @xmath291 then the dbi action can be expanded as @xmath292,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us focus on the quadratic terms of @xmath293 @xmath294,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from which we can derive the equation of motion for @xmath25 @xmath295 it was pointed out in  @xcite that the equation of motion for the fluctuation can be converted into a schrdinger equation . for our case this can be realized by defining @xmath296 then the equation of motion for @xmath62 becomes @xmath297 with the following effective potential @xmath298.\\ ] ]    the ac conductivity can be evaluated by numerical methods , whose details will be omitted here .",
    "the final results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where we show the real and imaginary conductivity depending on the charge density @xmath299 .",
    "it can be seen from the figure that at given @xmath300 , the real and imaginary conductivity increases and decreases respectively , as the charge density increases .",
    "interestingly , even for zero density in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] there exists non - zero conductivity , which may be related to the effect of the pair creation of charged particles .",
    "usually , as the energy goes up more charged particles can be created which can explain increasing of the real conductivity at the high energy region .",
    "another interesting point is that at the high density and low frequency regime ( see the case for @xmath301 ) the conductivity decreases as the frequency increases .",
    "this aspect would be explained as the follow : in this regime the pair creation of the charged particles generates induced electric field which diminishes the background electric field . since the charged carrier moves slowly due to the weakened electric field , the amount of the charged carrier current also grows smaller .",
    "this can explain the drop of the real conductivity in the high density and small energy regime . in the large energy case above the some critical frequency",
    ", the effect of the pair creation of charged particles would be more dominant , so it makes the real conductivity increases as the energy increases .",
    "[ fig1 ]    ( solid ) , @xmath50(dashed ) and @xmath302(dotted ) , where we set @xmath303 , @xmath304 , @xmath305 , @xmath306 and @xmath307.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] ( solid ) , @xmath50(dashed ) and @xmath302(dotted ) , where we set @xmath303 , @xmath304 , @xmath305 , @xmath306 and @xmath307.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] +      we will consider the effects of massive charge carriers in this section , which are more closely related to model building for real -world strange metals .",
    "in this case , the energy gap is large compared to the temperature : @xmath308 .",
    "when translated into the language of probe d - branes , the massive charge carriers correspond to flavor branes wrapping internal cycles , whose volumes vary with radial direction  @xcite .",
    "as pointed out in  @xcite , at finite temperature the flavor brane shrinks to a point at @xmath309 for large enough mass . in this case",
    "the charge carriers correspond to strings stretching from the flavor brane from @xmath309 to the black hole horizon @xmath310 . in a dilute",
    "limit one can consider a small density of such strings and ignore the backreaction . for larger densities the backreaction can not be neglected and the resulting configuration is that the brane forms a `` spike '' in place of the strings .",
    "we will study the dilute limit first and then take the backreaction into account .",
    "the massive charge carriers can be treated as strings stretching from the probe brane to the black hole horizon in the dilute limit , while there are no interactions between the strings . in this limit",
    "the probe brane is described by the zero - density solution , which has a cigar shape with @xmath309 at the tip .",
    "let us take the static gauge @xmath311 .",
    "when expanded to quadratic order for the transverse fluctuations , the nambu - goto action @xmath312 gives the following field equation @xmath313 in the zero - frequency limit , the field equation can be easily integrated out @xmath314 where @xmath315 is an integration constant and the relative normalization of the two terms is fixed by imposing incoming boundary conditions at the horizon . by assuming @xmath316 , at the boundary we can obtain @xmath317 according to drude s law we have the following relation @xmath318 therefore the dc conductivity in the dilute limit of the massive charge carriers is given by @xmath319    next we consider the ac case .",
    "the bulk equation of motion for @xmath320 reads @xmath321 now consider the case of zero magnetic field @xmath322 , at the boundary @xmath309 the surface term gives @xmath323 then the conductivity can be evaluated as @xmath324    in sum , we have the following scaling behaviors for the resistivity and conductivity in the dilute regime , @xmath325 where @xmath326 .",
    "recall that in real - world strange metals , @xmath327 where @xmath328 .",
    "therefore if we require our dual gravity background to exhibit the same scaling behavior , we have to set @xmath329 the consistency of the above choices for the parameters has been verified .",
    "when the backreaction of the massive charge carriers can not be neglected , we should introduce an additional scalar field which corresponds to the `` mass '' operator in the boundary field theory .",
    "the volume of the internal cycle wrapped by the probe brane is determined by this scalar field . in this case",
    "the dbi action becomes @xmath330 where @xmath331 denotes the volume of the @xmath206-dimensional submanifold wrapped by the probe brane .",
    "notice that here we have introduced the worldvolume gauge field as follows @xmath332 and the induced metric component is given by @xmath333 .",
    "the calculations of the dc conductivity are almost the same as the massless case , except for that there exists an additional equation determining the background profile of the probe brane @xmath334 @xmath335-\\frac{d}{d\\theta}[v^{-2k_{0}}v(\\theta)^{2n}g^{3/2}_{xx } \\sqrt{-g_{tt}g_{\\sigma\\sigma}}gf^{1/2}]=0.\\ ] ] the dc conductivity is given by @xmath336 note that in the massless limit @xmath337 , the above result reduces to the one obtained in previous section  ( [ 3eq18 ] ) .",
    "the calculations of the ac conductivity are also similar to the massless case .",
    "in particular , the equation for the fluctuation can still be transformed into a schrdinger form . at first sight",
    "one may consider that we can perform similar calculations as for the massless case .",
    "however , one key point in the calculations of  @xcite was that in a wide range @xmath338 , the profile of the embedding was approximately constant .",
    "this behavior was confirmed by numerical calculations and played a crucial role in simplifying the corresponding schrdinger equation .",
    "unfortunately , here we can not find such a constant behavior for the profile of the embedding .",
    "the profile turns out to be singular in the near horizon region .",
    "thus we can not simplify the schrdinger equation considerably to find the analytic solutions .",
    "it might be related to the non - trivial dilaton field in the dbi action and we expect that such singular behavior may be cured in realistic d - brane configurations , which might enable us to calculate the transport coefficients .",
    "strange metals are fascinating subjects in condensed matter physics , though comprehensive theoretical understanding on their properties is still under investigation . since ads / cft correspondence provides a powerful framework for analyzing dynamics of strongly coupled field theories , it is desirable to see if ads / cft can shed light on issues related to strange metals . in this paper",
    "we review our recent work on holographic strange metals  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "we consider the effects induced by the bulk maxwell fields , the additional @xmath0 gauge fields , as well as the probe d - branes .",
    "first , we study fluctuations of the background gauge field , which is coupled with the dilaton field . due to this non - trivial dilaton coupling ,",
    "the conductivity of this system depends on the frequency non - trivially . after choosing appropriate parameters , at both zero and finite temperature",
    "we obtain the strange metal - like ac conductivity proportional to the frequency with a negative exponent .",
    "second , we also investigate the effects of an extra @xmath0 gauge field fluctuations without dilaton coupling .",
    "we classify all possible conductivities either analytically or numerically , according to the ranges of the parameters in the bulk theory .",
    "we find that the conductivities for @xmath156 at zero and finite temperature become constant , due to the trivial gauge coupling in the action for the additional @xmath0 gauge field .",
    "this implies that to describe frequency - dependent conductivities , it would be important to consider nontrivial gauge coupling at least in the current approach .",
    "we also investigate the dependence of the conductivity on the spatial momentum and the temperature .",
    "we find that as the spatial momentum increased , the real part of the conductivity went down .",
    "in addition , we also find that the dc conductivity at finite temperature becomes a non - zero constant while the one at zero temperature is zero in this set - up .",
    "third , we discuss dynamics of both massless and massive charge carriers , which are represented by probe d - branes . for massless charge carriers ,",
    "we obtain the dc conductivity and dc hall conductivity by applying the approach proposed in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the results can reproduce those obtained in  @xcite in certain specific limits .",
    "we also calculate the ac conductivity by transforming the corresponding equation of motion into the schrdinger equation . for massive charge carriers ,",
    "the dc and ac conductivities are also obtained in the dilute limit .",
    "when the parameters in the action take the following values , @xmath339 and @xmath340 , we can realize the experimental values of the resistivity and the ac conductivity for strange metals simultaneously in the dual gravity side .",
    "we also obtain the dc conductivity at finite density .",
    "one thing we are not able to analyze is the ac conductivity at finite density , which may be due to the singular behavior of the d - brane embedding profiles .",
    "we expect that such a difficulty may be cured in realistic d - brane configurations .",
