    "electron transfer ( et ) reactions are important for an understanding of many processes in chemistry , biology and physics .",
    "popular examples include charge transfer in semiconductors , chemical reactions , or the primary et step in bacterial photosynthesis , and , despite the long history of the field @xcite , et still attracts unbroken and ( probably exponentially ) increasing attention @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "a theoretical study of et reactions based on the spin - boson ( dissipative two - state ) description is presented .",
    "the spin - boson model provides a well - established description of et processes in condensed phase environments , which can be motivated from the central limit theorem or , alternatively , using linear response theory @xcite . in this model ,",
    "two localized quantum states corresponding to the redox sites are taken .",
    "this two - level system ( tls ) is fully specified by a tunnel splitting @xmath0 ( which is twice the electronic coupling between the two redox sites ) , and by a bias @xmath1 ( which corresponds to the energy difference between the sites ) . of crucial importance",
    "is then the coupling to the `` environmental '' modes ( bath ) , which is modeled as an infinite set of harmonic oscillators with a suitable ( continuous ) spectral density @xmath2 describing their frequency - resolved coupling strength to the electron . for a given et system",
    ", one can use classical molecular dynamics simulations to find the appropriate @xmath2 @xcite , but below we shall consider a specific class of spectral densities that describes many et processes quite accurately .",
    "two important parameters following from a given spectral density are the _ reorganization energy _",
    "@xmath3 ( which describes the overall coupling strength ) and the typical bath frequency @xmath4 corresponding to a maximum in @xmath2 . this model has been studied in depth in the field of dissipative quantum mechanics @xcite , mostly in the so - called scaling limit for ohmic spectral densities ( see below ) , but its application to et reactions is mainly located in a different parameter regime .    certain limiting cases of et theory are rather well understood .",
    "the primary object of interest is the _ thermal rate constant _ @xmath5 , which is useful if et dynamics is correctly described by exponential decay .",
    "first , for very small @xmath6 , one can use perturbation theory in @xmath6 to obtain the celebrated golden rule rate @xcite .",
    "this is the _",
    "nonadiabatic limit_. in the opposite limit of large @xmath6 , the _",
    "adiabatic limit _",
    ", it is more useful to think in terms of adiabatic free energy surfaces formed by linear superpositions of the two localized free energies . in that case",
    ", the bath essentially is very slow ( `` classical '' ) compared to the electronic motion , and one can develop a simple theoretical description again @xcite . notably , the et dynamics in this regime is often not simply an exponential relaxation but exhibits oscillatory or multi - exponential behavior at low temperatures @xcite . at sufficiently high temperatures , the famous _ classical marcus theory _",
    "@xcite , or semiclassical generalizations thereof @xcite , apply . for a path - integral approach to marcus theory , see also ref .",
    "marcus theory also makes predictions about the rate constant in the crossover regime between nonadiabatic and adiabatic et .",
    "it should be stressed that the spin - boson model contains all these results as limiting cases in the full parameter space .",
    "notably , the spin - boson problem can not be solved analytically without imposing approximations .",
    "one important exception to this rule is the case of an ohmic spectral density , see eq .",
    "( [ ohmic ] ) below , with the restrictions : @xmath7 in this scaling limit , sophisticated conformal field theory techniques are able to yield the complete non - equilibrium solution for the dynamics under arbitrary initial preparation @xcite .",
    "besides this solution , whose parameter regime is of little interest to et theory , if one is interested in analytical progress , one has several options for approximations .",
    "one possibility is to work perturbatively in the tunnel splitting @xmath6 .",
    "this leads to the noninteracting blip approximation ( niba ) @xcite , which is basically equivalent to the golden rule formula for the rate constant .",
    "other approaches are based on variational treatments @xcite or work perturbatively in the system - bath coupling ( redfield approach ) @xcite . as typical reorganization energies",
    "are quite sizeable , a perhaps more promising route is to use the powerful computer simulation methods available by now .",
    "let us then briefly summarize the numerical methods that have been applied to a study of the spin - boson dynamics .",
    "an approximate approach which has become quite popular recently employs a mixed quantum / classical ( or quantum / semiclassical ) description @xcite .",
    "however , such studies are typically restricted to a few bath modes .",
    "unless one has a situation with only a few strongly coupled bath modes , the more typical situation of condensed - phase et reactions is difficult to describe using such methods .",
    "in addition , it is hard to estimate the errors made under these approximations .",
    "similar arguments apply to time - dependent hartree methods ( basis set approach ) @xcite and to memory - equation approaches @xcite .",
    "the latter method , as well as the recently proposed stochastic langevin - type simulation @xcite , dynamical wilson renormalization group @xcite and the real - time renormalization group @xcite , basically appear to be restricted to the markovian limit realized for an ohmic bath with @xmath8 , yet most situations of interest for et are located outside the markovian regime .",
    "the methods discussed so far are therefore very powerful in certain parameter regions of the spin - boson model ( in fact much more powerful than our method employed below ) , but may fail badly in others .",
    "a method free from such restrictions is provided by _",
    "monte carlo simulations _",
    "@xcite , in particular the powerful path - integral monte carlo ( pimc ) approach . in principle , this approach is numerically exact throughout the full parameter space , i.e.  for arbitrary spectral density , tunnel coupling , temperature and/or bias .",
    "however , as one is really interested in the et _ dynamics _ in real time , a direct application of quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods is plagued by the infamous _ sign problem _ @xcite .",
    "one alternative is to carry out an imaginary - time simulation , which is intrinsically free of the sign problem , and then analytically continue the data to real time .",
    "this program has been carried out for the spin - boson problem , either using pade approximants @xcite or maximum entropy methods @xcite in order to perform the analytical continuation .",
    "the latter procedure is mathematically ill - defined and quite troublesome to carry out . in addition , by using this procedure , one is inevitably restricted to equilibrium situations .",
    "however , in et reactions one often has a true non - equilibrium preparation , e.g.  one photo - excites an electron to the donor state at time @xmath9 and then follows the time evolution of the occupation probability .",
    "such a question has to be answered by a true non - equilibrium real - time calculation .",
    "such a calculation is presented in our study .",
    "the price to pay for working in real time and still keeping exactness and applicability throughout the full parameter space is however quite high .",
    "the main challenge is due to the sign problem , which implies that one is restricted in the real - time range up to which stable calculations can be done .",
    "the sign problem arises from the destructive interference of a large number of quantum paths at long times , leading to a very small signal - to - noise ratio and thus rendering the simulations numerically unstable .",
    "early real - time pimc attempts for computing the spin - boson dynamics @xcite were based on the stationary - phase monte carlo approach @xcite or variations thereof .",
    "such filtering methods try to keep the mc trajectory close to the important stationary - phase regions of path space .",
    "while this is able to somewhat relieve the sign problem , a more powerful method is available by now .",
    "this `` multilevel blocking '' ( mlb ) algorithm @xcite has been proposed and successfully used to relieve both the fermionic and the dynamical sign problem .",
    "mlb represents a systematic recursive implementation of a simple _ blocking strategy_. roughly speaking , the blocking strategy is equivalent to a naive filtering , and one can think of mlb as a systematic and optimized way of implementing the filtering idea . here",
    "we shall employ a recently proposed mlb variant which can account for effective actions @xcite of the type encountered in pimc for the spin - boson model .",
    "this approach is superior to previous real - time pimc methods , and allows to compute the spin - boson dynamics up to timescales of practical interest _ without approximations and for the full parameter regime relevant to et reactions_.    the remainder of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ theory ] we briefly describe the spin - boson model and the dynamical quantities of interest . next we describe our qmc method , see sec .",
    "[ mc ] . since the method has been exposed in great detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , focusing on exactly the same model , we largely refrain from repeating ourselves here .",
    "technical details of interest to experts are given in the appendix . in section [ results ] we then present our numerical results for the dynamical quantities and the rate @xmath5 for various regimes , including the important crossover region between nonadiabatic and adiabatic et .",
    "the most difficult regime is at low temperatures , a regime that can now be treated by pimc . in presenting the numerical results , we restrict ourselves to the symmetric ( unbiased ) case @xmath10 , leaving the biased system for future studies . finally , some conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "the spin - boson model ( dissipative two - state system ) is defined by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath11 where the free tls is described by @xmath12 , containing the tunnel splitting @xmath0 and the energy gap @xmath1 between the two localized electronic states . here",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the standard pauli matrices acting in tls space , where the @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) state refers to the donor ( acceptor ) .",

    "the bath parameters affect et only via the spectral density @xmath19 which effectively becomes a continuous function of @xmath20 for a condensed - phase environment and determines all bath correlation functions that are relevant for the et dynamics .",

    "details of @xmath2 matter only at low temperatures .    in the following we focus on the two dynamical properties of primary relevance to et dynamics .",
    "the _ time - dependent occupation probability _ is defined as @xmath26 and gives the difference in the occupation probabilities of the donor and the acceptor state with the electron initially held fixed on the donor .",
    "this quantity then directly probes et dynamics after the non - equilibrium initial preparation corresponding to the initial density matrix @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the dipole moment of the electron , and @xmath29 denotes the dynamical polarization of the bath @xcite , with the electron in the donor state and the bath equilibrated with respect to it . by comparing with eq .",
    "( [ hamilton ] ) , we see that @xmath30 . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , this `` standard preparation '' often used in et experiments is unfavorable for coherent ( oscillatory ) dynamics when compared to other initial preparations .",
    "therefore it is especially suitable for a thermal transfer rate description .",
    "in addition , we calculate the complex - valued _ correlation function _ @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "this quantity probes the dynamics under an equilibrium preparation and , for @xmath10 , differs from @xmath33 only through the initial preparation . at high temperatures",
    ", one generally expects that initial preparation effects show little influence on the dynamics , and therefore a unique rate constant @xmath5 should exist .",
    "the inverse rate would then be the timescale governing the relaxation of both @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "however , in the quantum regime one needs to be more careful , and the specific experiment under study will determine which is the relevant dynamical quantity .",
    "assuming for the moment that there is a unique rate constant @xmath5 , @xmath33 should follow a simple exponential decay for times @xmath35 large compared to some transient molecular timescale @xmath36 of the order @xmath37 , yet small compared to the relaxation timescale @xmath38 . calculating @xmath33 for @xmath39",

    "such a breakdown of the rate description could happen , for instance , for very fast reactions .",
    "equation ( [ timerate ] ) thus not only yields a convenient way to compute the thermal transfer rate , but also a means to decide upon the validity of the rate picture of et at all .",
    "it is important to stress that @xmath43 does not refer to a time - dependent rate reflecting the dynamics of @xmath33 but is only an auxiliary function allowing to determine the time - independent rate @xmath5 when it exists .",
    "equation ( [ timerate ] ) can be expressed in terms of @xmath34 , @xmath51 with @xmath52 .",
    "the fact that @xmath33 will follow an exponential decay only after some time @xmath36 is made explicit by noting that @xmath53 due to @xmath54 . our main goal is therefore to calculate the et dynamics up to real times that are significantly larger than @xmath36 .    before turning to the numerical computations ,",

    "essentially , it then represents a static random field obeying gaussian statistics , which acts as an additional fluctuating energy gap between the electronic states .",

    "( [ a12 ] ) .",
    "notably , for @xmath77 but close to 1/2 , the dynamics is much more complicated , with algebraic decay and oscillatory behaviors @xcite .",
    "these features are due to _ electronic coherence _ effects , which one generally does not expect to survive in et reactions .",
    "this is also reflected in the behavior of @xmath34 for @xmath72 , which exhibits long - time algebraic tails .",
    "therefore one can not expect that the time - dependent function @xmath43 will exhibit plateau behavior , although it is possible to define a rate for the decay of @xmath33 .",
    "this reflects the importance of the initial preparation in that case .",

    "can be changed into an only algebraic one @xcite .",
    "single spin flips and , on the real - time axis , double spin flips , with simultaneous flips of the forward and backward spins @xmath123 and @xmath124 , were used to propagate the mc trajectory .",
    "furthermore , since the creation of short blips ( connected real - time intervals where @xmath125 ) is often energetically more expensive than the creation of more extended ones , we also included flips of complete blocks of subsequent spins to ensure ergodicity .",
    "when working with mlb , these blocks must not extend over the borderline separating different levels .",
    "however , since the results do not deviate from those obtained with local spin flips alone , we conclude that ergodicity poses no problem for our approach .",
    "in this section , we present numerical results for the thermal transfer rate @xmath5 and the occupation probability @xmath33 of an unbiased system , @xmath126 . of course",
