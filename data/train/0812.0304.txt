    "smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) @xcite is a lagrangian method which represents a fluid by a distribution of particles . each particle is assigned a mass , position , internal energy and velocity : state variables such as density and pressure can then be calculated by interpolation - see reviews by @xcite .",
    "the effects of gravitation are also included as standard in most sph codes . recently",
    ", many authors have constructed versions of sph with effects of radiative transfer @xcite .",
    "a full description of polychromatic 3d radiative transfer is currently not possible within sph ( at least while current computational limitations prevent it ) .",
    "even describing a snapshot from a simulation using full polychromatic radiative transfer is quite expensive @xcite . in the past",
    ", approximations to individual features of radiative transfer were used - for example the cooling time formalism : @xmath6 , @xcite which only describes energy loss from the system , and does not model transport of energy between neighbouring particles .",
    "+ an example of where radiative transfer plays a fundamental role is in the physics of gravitational instabilities ( gis ) in protoplanetary discs .",
    "the simple parametrisation of the cooling time method allowed these gis to be probed and characterised effectively .",
    "gravitational fragmentation of protoplanetary discs is key to the disc instability theory of giant planet formation @xcite .",
    "however , it is disputed whether fragmentation can indeed occur , with strong debate between different groups using different methods of simulation and different formalisms for radiative transfer . at the time of writing",
    "there is no strong consensus as to whether gravitational instability and fragmentation in protoplanetary discs can be a realistic mechanism for giant planet formation . + for fragmentation to occur , the disc must become gravitationally unstable , so that gravity can overcome pressure support and rotational support .",
    "the disc can become gravitationally unstable to axisymmetric instabilities if @xcite :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the local sound speed , @xmath9 is the epicyclic frequency , and @xmath10 is the surface density of the disc . in a keplerian disc , the epicyclic frequency",
    "is replaced by the angular frequency , @xmath11 .",
    "if the perturbation is nonaxisymmetric , the condition becomes @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "further to this condition , the cooling of the gas must be efficient enough to radiate away energy gained by compression during the contraction .",
    "use of the cooling time formalism allowed a quantitative statement of this second condition : @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "+ more recent efforts have used more sophisticated approximations to capture the equation of state ( eos ) of the gas , and model realistic radiative cooling and radiation transport , using both sph @xcite and grid codes @xcite , but these are becoming increasingly complex , with some methods requiring mapping of the photosphere ( which is often of non - trivial geometric shape ) , and extra conditions to be applied there ( matching atmospheres as in @xcite , or specifying cooling at the photosphere as in @xcite ) . also , identifying the photosphere often requires extra free parameters , the changing of which will affect the final results .",
    "the latest radiative transfer approximations ( such as @xcite , which solves the full radiative transfer equation explicitly in the vertical direction ) are now attempting to remove this parametrisation .",
    "+ this paper presents a new radiative transfer approximation , which relies on two separate methods working in tandem .",
    "the first method is the polytropic approximation devised by @xcite , which models the cooling of particles over a range of optical depths ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "its formulation ensures that cooling will be at its most efficient where the optical depth is around unity , in accordance with the definition of the photosphere .",
    "this avoids the necessity of explicitly computing the location of the photosphere , or imposing boundary conditions upon it .",
    "the second method is the flux - limited diffusion approximation , used by many authors @xcite to simulate radiation transport in optically thick regimes .",
    "although presented as an algorithm for particle - based codes , the hybrid algorithm can be applied to grid - based codes also .",
    "this hybrid method captures all the physics of frequency - averaged radiative transfer , without relying on parametrisation .",
    "+ the paper is organised as follows . in section [",
    "sec : method ] the constituents of the new hybrid algorithm are presented ; it is then shown how these methods are combined to create the new algorithm . in section [ sec : tests ] , the results from the following test scenarios are given : the evolution of a @xmath3 protoplanetary disc used as an example by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ; the collapse of a @xmath15 molecular cloud @xcite ; and the thermal relaxation of a static sphere with seeded temperature fluctuations @xcite .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] , the method is summarised , and some indications of future work are given .",
    "the polytropic approximation uses an sph particle s density @xmath16 , temperature @xmath17 , and gravitational potential @xmath18 to estimate a mean optical depth for the particle @xcite .",
    "the approximation is achieved as follows .",
    "assume the particle is embedded in a spherically symmetric polytropic `` pseudocloud '' ( which need not be in hydrostatic equilibrium ) .",
    "the properties of the cloud are calculable analytically ( using the lane emden equation ) , given the particle s ( dimensionless ) radius @xmath19 from the centre : @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , by appropriate selection of the central values of density and temperature @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and the scale - length @xmath23 , the particle s own values can be recovered :    @xmath24    @xmath25    @xmath26    here @xmath27 is the solution to the lane - emden equation for a polytrope of index @xmath28 , and    @xmath29    ( where @xmath30 is the boundary of the polytrope ) and @xmath23 satisfies    @xmath31^{1/2}.\\ ] ]    this provides the tools to calculate a column density from any given ( dimensionless ) radius to the boundary of the cloud :    @xmath32    @xmath33^{1/2 } \\int^{\\xi'=\\xi_b}_{\\xi'=\\xi } \\theta^n(\\xi ' ) \\,\\mathrm{d}\\xi ' .\\ ] ]    however , it is assumed that the value of @xmath19 for the particle is unknown . instead",

    "they select @xmath43 for their work , as this would give a polytropic exponent of @xmath44 , in keeping with polytropic exponents of protostars in quasistatic equilibrium .",
    "when using the polytropic formalism alone , the results of this paper will assume @xmath43 , ( and hence @xmath45 ) except where otherwise stated .",
    "the simple expression for the column density illustrates its ability to capture the effects of the local environment ( through the presence of @xmath46 ) and the effects of the system s global geometry ( through the gravitational potential @xmath47 ) .",
    "+ in the same vein , a mass weighted optical depth can be calculated .",
    "the optical depth from any radius to the edge of the pseudocloud is    @xmath48    substituting for @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 gives    @xmath49^{1/2 } \\times\\ ] ]    @xmath50^n , t_i \\left[\\frac{\\theta(\\xi')}{\\theta(\\xi)}\\right ] \\right)\\left[\\frac{\\theta(\\xi')}{\\theta(\\xi)}\\right]^n \\,\\mathrm{d}\\xi ' .\\ ] ]    taking a mass weighted average then gives the rather messy    @xmath51^{-1}\\left[\\frac{-\\psi_i \\rho_i}{4\\pi g } \\right]^{1/2 }",

    "however , using the previous result for @xmath53 , a mass weighted opacity can be defined ,    @xmath54    and this can be evaluated in advance , and stored for later interpolation . hence , for a given @xmath55 :    @xmath56^{-1 } \\int^{\\xi=\\xi_b}_{\\xi=0 } \\int^{\\xi'=\\xi_b}_{\\xi'=\\xi}\\ ] ]    @xmath57^n , t\\left[\\frac{\\theta(\\xi')}{\\theta(\\xi ) } \\right ]   \\right ) \\theta^n(\\xi')\\mathrm{d}\\xi ' \\left[\\frac{\\theta^n(\\xi)}{\\phi(\\xi)}\\right]^{1/2}\\xi^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}\\xi .\\ ] ]    the interpretation of this result is important : embedding the particle at some position in the polytrope ensures that the environment immediately surrounding the particle has a strong effect on its optical depth , and hence its emission .",
    "this allows ( for example ) insulation of hot particles by cooler surroundings .",
    "it is vital at this juncture to appreciate the meaning of this : _ the formalism is attempting to compensate for absorption of escaping radiation by modifying the net radiative losses _ of the particles using the polytrope approximation .",
    "+ if the net cooling term for sph particle _ i _ is @xmath58 , this then becomes    @xmath59    the addition of @xmath60 allows for external heating from a background radiation field ( which can be configured to include irradiation from stellar objects ) .",
    "note that both the particle s opacity and mass weighted opacity are required .",
    "the first term in the denominator becomes dominant in the optically thick case ( where the particle s environment will absorb much of the cooling radiation it emits , reducing the energy loss ) , and the second term becomes dominant in the optically thin case ( where the effects of the environment are less important , so the standard opacity is used ) .",
    "strictly speaking , the first term should be a mass weighted average of the rosseland - mean opacity , and the second term should use the planck - mean opacity , but in the case of this work the rosseland - mean and planck - mean opacities are taken to be equal .",
    "an explanation of the two terms in the denominator can be found in @xcite .",
    "+ the construction of @xmath58 allows the code to move smoothly from optically thin to optically thick regimes , and also identifies an optimum regime where the optical depth is of order unity , where the particle can emit radiation most efficiently ( i.e. the photosphere ) .",
    "+ the method is very efficient , having little impact on the total simulation time and performing very well in several tests of its ability @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it does suffer from some key limitations :    1 .",
    "assuming a spherical pseudocloud will place restrictions on how well the code models different geometries : configurations that lack spherical symmetry will not be modelled as accurately as those that are spherically symmetric , although its general accuracy has been shown to be good @xcite .",
    "2 .   although the formalism accounts for the surroundings of the particle when modelling its emission , it does not deal in detail with the exchange of heat energy between neighbouring fluid elements .",
    "this makes it incapable of capturing accurately all the physics in the optically thick regime .",
    "the modelling of energy exchange is implemented using the flux - limited diffusion formalism used by @xcite , which is in turn based on work in conduction modelling by @xcite and the flux limiter used by @xcite . in the diffusion approximation ,",
    "the rate of energy change for particle @xmath61 is    @xmath62    the summation index @xmath63 describes the nearest neighbours of the particle ( which is tracked by sph to evaluate density fields and other requisite variables ) ; @xmath64 is the smoothing kernel , @xmath65 is the separation vector between particles @xmath61 and @xmath63 , and @xmath66 describes the thermal conductivity of the particle .",
    "the gradient of the kernel is everywhere negative , so if @xmath67 , the summand will be negative ( i.e. energy will flow from particle @xmath61 to particle @xmath63 , in accordance with the laws of thermodynamics ) . if the system s energy budget is defined entirely by diffusion , the particles will exchange energy amongst themselves in order to reduce temperature gradients ; the long term evolution of the system will be towards a single equilibrium temperature .",
    "this `` washing out '' of temperature gradients is of critical importance : when simulating protoplanetary discs , the temperature profile ( both radially and vertically ) can define the regions of the disc where possible fragmentation can occur , and hence the regions where giant planets may form @xcite .",
    "any process which affects these profiles will influence where these regions are located . + it should be noted at this point that all energy changes due to these diffusion terms are _ pairwise _ , i.e. any energy loss by one particle will be matched by gain in its counterpart .",
    "this means that the total energy change over the entire system due to diffusion must be zero :    @xmath68    this is an important feature , which allows it to be used in the hybrid method , as will be shown later .",
    "the thermal conductivity is    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is the opacity , @xmath71 is the stefan - boltzmann constant and @xmath72 is the flux limiter .",
    "@xcite describe an expression for @xmath72 which is calculated from the local radiation field :    @xmath73    here @xmath74 is a function of the radiation energy density at the particle s position ,",
    "@xmath75 :    @xmath76    studying the expression for @xmath74 , there are two limiting cases :    * when the region is very optically thick , @xmath46 and @xmath9 become large ( and the radiation field becomes uniform ) , and hence @xmath77 . in this limit , the flux limiter @xmath78 , in accordance with the diffusion approximation . * in the very optically thin limit , @xmath74 becomes very large , and @xmath79 , ending energy transport by diffusion .",
    "this approximation is valid in the optically thick regime ( and to lower optical depths with the use of the flux limiter , which prevents energy exchange as the mean free path of the radiation becomes prohibitively large )",
    ". limitations of this method are :    1 .",
    "it does not model radiation well at very low optical depths ( where energy exchange disappears ) 2 .",
    "it does not allow the system to lose energy ( i.e. it does not model radiative cooling ) .",
    "instead , this cooling must be added using a prescription which assumes prior knowledge of the geometry of the system being studied , and invokes resolution dependent free parameters ( e.g. @xcite ) .      comparing the limitations of the above two methods ,",
    "it is clear that a union of these two procedures should be complementary : polytropic cooling handles the important energy loss from the system ( which flux - limited diffusion can not ) , and flux - limited diffusion handles the detailed exchange of heat between neighbouring fluid elements ( which polytropic cooling can not ) . indeed , polytropic cooling s inability to model the detailed exchange of heat between neighbouring fluid elements - and flux - limited diffusion s inability to model energy loss - allow the two methods to work together correctly , modelling all aspects of the system s energy budget without encroaching on each other .",
    "the energy equation simply becomes    @xmath80    where @xmath81 describes the energy change due to the hydrodynamics of the system , e.g. compressive @xmath82 heating .",
    "the true advantage to using this hybrid method is in its simplicity :    * by construction ,",
    "the hybrid method is fully three - dimensional , and capable of handling arbitrary particle geometries .",
    "* there is no requirement to grid the system . *",
    "the algorithm is continuous over a wide range of optical depths , so there are no requirements to match separate atmospheres at some boundary . *",
    "as no extra boundary conditions are required , there are no extra parameters to be specified , so the simulation s results are only dependent on the traditional sph parameters ( particle number , smoothing length etc ) .",
    "however , the hybrid method still suffers from some disadvantages :    1 .",
    "this method is still unable to model frequency dependent radiative transfer .",
    "as with polytropic cooling , the hybrid method is better suited to modelling the cooling of spherical geometries .",
    "the use of an explicit scheme to update energy can result in very short time steps . to avoid this , a modified version of the implicit scheme adopted by @xcite is used .",
    "this models each particle s approach to its equilibrium temperature @xmath83 , which satisfies    @xmath84    from this , the equilibrium internal energy @xmath85 can be calculated , and hence the thermalisation timescale :    @xmath86    with knowledge of how quickly each particle can be thermalised , the particle s energy can be updated thus :    @xmath87 + u_{eq , i}\\left(1 - exp\\left[\\frac{-\\delta t}{t_{therm}}\\right ] \\right)\\ ] ]    for particles that will thermalise very quickly ( @xmath88 ) , which would result in very short timesteps , this equation reduces to    @xmath89    i.e. , the particle rapidly reaches equilibrium .",
    "if thermalisation happens on a long timescale ( @xmath90 ) , then the equation becomes    @xmath91      vital to any radiative transfer method is how the variables it uses ( temperature , opacity , etc ) are evaluated .",
    "sph evolves only the density and internal energy of the particles : hence some kind of prescription is required in order to obtain the requisite data .",
    "essentially , what is required is @xmath92 , @xmath93 etc . in practice",
    ", it is more straightforward to evaluate @xmath94 ( known as the equation of state ) and @xmath95 ( the opacity law ) and tabulate these values , which can then be interpolated to achieve the correct results .",
    "the equation of state and the opacity law used in this work are similar to that of @xcite , where a full description is available ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this work assumes hydrogen and helium mass fractions of @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and a fixed ortho- to para - hydrogen ratio of @xmath98 .",
    "the dependence of the various variables on temperature can be seen in figures [ fig : u_plot ] , [ fig : muplot ] , [ fig : kappa ] & [ fig : kappa_bar ] .",
    "figures [ fig : u_plot ] & [ fig : muplot ] show the activation of the various energy states of hydrogen and helium gas as temperature increases : figure [ fig : kappa ] shows the opacity law as calculated according to the prescription of @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : kappa_bar ] shows the mass weighted opacity as discussed in @xcite . the opacity law captures many different opacity regimes of the gas , including ice and dust opacities , as well as molecular absorption , bound - free and free - free interactions and electron scattering .",
    "the code used to perform these tests is based on the sph code developed by @xcite .",
    "it uses variable individual smoothing lengths @xmath99 in order that the number of nearest neighbours for any particle is @xmath100 .",
    "it uses individual particle timesteps to allow dense regions to be simulated with greater time resolution while preventing oversimulation of less dense regions .",
    "a binary tree is employed to calculate neighbour lists and calculate gravity forces .",
    "the standard artificial viscosity is also used .",
    "all simulations are sufficiently populated to satisfy the jeans resolution condition of @xcite for jeans masses of @xmath101 or less .",
    "these conditions are sufficient for the cloud simulations performed .",
    "+ for the disc simulations performed , the toomre length becomes important in the regions that are unstable , and places stricter resolution conditions .",
    "as the disc simulation is keplerian , the following relation can be used between the jeans length and the toomre length @xcite :    @xmath102    where @xmath103 represents the conversion factor between surface and volume densities . as the disc is marginally unstable ( @xmath104 ) ,",
    "the toomre length can be simply calculated . converting this ( assuming a homogeneous sphere ) into a toomre mass , it is calculated that the disc simulation can resolve toomre masses of @xmath105 or more .      as a means of comparison with previous results ,",
    "the conditions used for this test are those proposed by meja et al , and used in a series of papers describing radiative transfer in protoplanetary discs @xcite .",

    "for both methods , several key phases are identified : the initial settling phase , during which the disc adjusts its outer radius by axisymmetric evolution , and ring formation and contraction occurs ; the `` burst '' phase where nonaxisymmetric instabilities , in the form of spiral waves , begin to grow ; and the later asymptotic phase , where the disc s radial extent is more firmly established , and the gravitational instability is regulated ( cf .",

    "comparing the hybrid method against the results of using the polytropic cooling approximation alone , there are significant differences : the hybrid method transports more mass radially outward , which can be seen in the surface density of the disc ( figure [ fig : mejia_profiles ] , top left panel ) .",
    "this has several important consequences : it allows the optical depth to be reduced in the region @xmath114 au , which allows an increase in radiative cooling ; this in turn allows the outer disc to be cooler , and for the outer regions of the disc ( @xmath115 au ) to become less stable ( as can be seen in the other panels of figure [ fig : mejia_profiles ] ) .",
    "snapshots of the disc under both methods can be seen in ( figure [ fig : twodisc ] ) .",

    "it can also be seen ( by comparing the surface density profiles of the hybrid method and polytropic cooling ) that there appears to be a surplus of matter within @xmath117 au , and a slight deficit at @xmath118 au , indicating that @xmath119 au may be the location where mass transport switches from inward to outward , again consistent with the results of boley et al . however , there are some important differences to be considered .",
    "the burst phase of the hybrid method is noticeably weaker , and the disc undergoes less radial spreading .",

    "the differences in the eos and the opacity law will have a stronger effect in the hotter inner regions of the disc , perhaps explaining the differences in surface density profile , and the lack of radial spreading .",
    "it should also be noted that the inner disc stays somewhat hotter than expected ( for both polytropic cooling alone , and for the hybrid method ) .",
    "this may be due to sph viscosity : as the distance to the centre decreases , the magnitude of the sph viscosity increases , and may become significant ( relative to the effective gravitational viscosity ) .",

    "+ comparisons with simulations using polytropic cooling alone have shown that the hybrid method is in effect only a small correction to the polytropic cooling method , which however can become important in some problems where temperature gradients and system geometries become complex ( for example the protoplanetary disc simulations described in this paper ) .",
