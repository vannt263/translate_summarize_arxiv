    "observations and modeling of thermal emission from isolated neutron stars can provide not only information on the physical properties such as the magnetic field , temperature , and chemical composition of the regions where this radiation is produced , but also we may infer on the properties of matter at higher densities deeper inside the star .    in particular , the study of thermal emission from isolated neutron stars may allow one to infer the surface temperature and total flux measured by a distant observer and to estimate the real parameters . with the known distance and the redshifted radius of the neutron star the actual radius and mass of a neutron star",
