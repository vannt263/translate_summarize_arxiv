    "it is generally accepted that helium - core white dwarf ( he wd ) stars constitute the final product of the evolution of some close binary systems .",
    "this is so because an isolated star would need a time - scale much longer than the present age of the universe to reach a he wd configuration .",
    "the mass of these objects should be smaller than that required for degenerate helium ignition , @xmath5 m@xmath3 ( mazzitelli 1989 ) , thus resulting in very low mass wds .",
    "low mass wds have been detected in large surveys ( bragaglia et al . 1990 ; bergeron , saffer & liebert 1992 ; bragaglia , renzini & bergeron 1995 ; saffer , livio & yungelson 1998 ) and represent an appreciable fraction of the total population of wd stars .",
    "the interest in the study of these stars has greatly increased since their binary nature was placed on a solid observational ground by marsh ( 1995 ) and marsh , dhillon & duck ( 1995 ) .",
    "indeed , he wd have been detected in numerous binary systems containing usually either another wd or a millisecond pulsar ( moran , marsh & bragaglia 1997 ; orosz et al .",
    "1999 ; van kerkwijk et al .",
    "2000 amongst others ) .",
    "such systems are very interesting because they enable us to infer the properties of one component of the system from studying the physical properties of the other .",
    "this is important in connection with pulsar mass determinations and the structure and evolution of wd stars .",
    "the recent detection of low mass he wds ( m @xmath6 0.20 m@xmath3 ) in compact binaries belonging to globular clusters ( cool et al .",
    "1998 ; edmonds et al . 1999 ; taylor et al .",
    "2001 ; edmonds et al . 2001 ) has also sparked the attention of many researchers .",
    "the interest in studying he wds in globular cluster is motivated not only by their importance in the understanding of the formation and evolution of the compact binaries in which these stars are found but also by the possibility they offer of constraining globular cluster dynamics and evolution .",
    "numerous studies have been devoted to the evolution of he wds . amongst them",
    "we mention those of benvenuto & althaus ( 1998 ) , driebe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , hansen & phinney ( 1998 ) , sarna , antipova & ergma ( 1999 ) and althaus , serenelli & benvenuto ( 2001 ) .",
    "in particular , althaus et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have investigated the effect of element diffusion on the evolution of he wds taking into account the evolutionary stages prior to the wd formation .",
    "these authors find that element diffusion induces thermonuclear hydrogen shell flashes in he wd models with stellar masses in the range @xmath7 m / m@xmath8 .",
    "in particular , althaus et al .",
    "( 2001 ) show that the occurrence of such diffusion - induced flashes leads to he wd models with hydrogen envelope masses too small to support any further nuclear burning , thus implying much shorter cooling ages than in the case when diffusion is neglected . as shown by althaus et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , such short cooling ages remove the discrepancy between the spin - down age of the millisecond pulsars b1855 + 09 , psr j0034 - 0534 and psr j1012 + 5307 and the cooling ages of their he wd companions .",
    "evolutionary calculations of althaus et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have received tentative support from the optical detection of the wd companion to the millisecond pulsar in 47 tucanae ( edmonds et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "colours and magnitudes appropriate for old he wds with the predictions of stellar evolution and element diffusion have recently been derived in a self - consistent way by serenelli et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . in the serenelli et al .",
    "( 2001 ) calculations , emphasis is placed on the late stages of evolution where wd cooling is strongly affected by the treatment of the outer layers , particularly of the atmosphere .",
    "these authors have explored at some length the evolution of he wds and found that when the effective temperature decreases below 4000k , the emergent spectrum of these stars becomes bluer within time - scales of astrophysical interest . because serenelli et al .",
    "( 2001 ) were interested in the late stages of he wd evolution , they did not attempt a detailed modeling of the emergent spectrum of these stars at high effective temperature stages ( @xmath9 k ) .    in this paper we improve the calculations of serenelli et al .",
    "( 2001 ) by including a more detailed treatment of the microphysics entering the wd atmosphere .",
    "this enables us to derive accurate colours and magnitudes for he wds at high effective temperatures where the effects of line broadening opacities are not negligible .",
    "another aim of the present work is to extend the evolutionary calculations presented in serenelli et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to less massive he wd models on the basis of a more physically sound treatment of the mass transfer stage than that attempted in serenelli et al.(2001 ) .",
    "this will allow us to compare the predictions of our evolutionary models with the observations of the he wd candidates recently reported in the globular clusters ngc 6397 and 47 tucanae by taylor et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and edmonds et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , respectively .",
    "the magnitude calculations in the ultraviolet and optical regions are strongly sensitive to the inclusion of hydrogen - line opacity ( particularly for @xmath10 k ) , which has been neglected in our previous model grids ( rohrmann 2001 , serenelli et al .",
    "for the present work , we include this additional opacity source in the atmosphere code and we re - calculate the models of serenelli et al . , yielding a better prediction of the colour indices for hot he wds .",
    "furthermore , the evaluation of non - ideal effects in the gas allows us to calculate more realist atmosphere models for wds at both early and advanced stages of the cooling .",
    "in fact , wd atmospheres are well known to be characterized by high densities ( so high as @xmath11 gr/@xmath12 ) where interactions amongst neighbouring particles , charged and neutral , affect the number of bound states of atoms and molecules .",
    "these particle perturbations can modify the chemical equilibrium of the gas and its optical properties .",
    "the occupation probability formalism of hummer & mihalas ( 1988 ) provides a tool to treat non - ideal effects in the gas of stellar envelopes .",
    "this theory avoids typical rough truncations of particle partition functions giving a thermodynamically self - consistent way to calculate the ionization and excitation equilibrium in the gas .",
    "the occupation formalism was introduced by bergeron ( 1988 ) in the context of wd atmospheres and we have chosen it for the present work .    the application of hummer - mihalas formalism for calculating atomic populations necessitates corresponding improvements in the formulae used to compute the optical properties of the gas .",
    "phenomenological proposals of simulations of the optical spectra in the framework of the occupational formalism have been given by dppen , anderson & mihalas ( 1987 ) and hubeny , hummer & lanz ( 1994 ) .",
    "these researches introduce the calculation of the so - called pseudo - continuum absorption , which rises from ionization of atoms strongly perturbed .",
    "this opacity source becomes very important in wd stars for different ranges of effective temperatures , particularly when the balmer lines contribute significantly to the total opacity ( e.g. bergeron , wesemael & fontaine 1991 ) . in view of the preceding considerations , we found it necessary to adopt here a particular optical representation for our atmosphere calculations .",
    "it is worth noting that the opacity theory for non - ideal gases is still in a preliminary stage and additional studies are necessary .",
    "in addition to the improvements perfomed on the equation of state of the gas , new quantum mechanical data of collision - induced absorption ( cia ) processes have been incorporated in our atmosphere code .",
    "these new data yield significant changes in the emergent radiative energy obtained for cool he wd models as compared with previous calculations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :  2 describes the new treatments of the input physics in the atmosphere code . in  3 ,",
    "the atmosphere models are coupled with evolutionary calculations and news , accurate results are given for very low mass he wd stars .",
    "conclusions are presented in  4 .",
    "the model atmospheric structures were computed by means of a code developed recently ( rohrmann 2001 ) , which has been improved in a number of aspects . in what follows ,",
    "we describe at some length the main improvements we have included in our code .",
    "one of the most important improvements considered in this work concerns the incorporation in our code of the occupational probability formalism of hummer & mihalas ( 1988 ) for the treatment of non - ideal effects in the gas equation of state .",
    "this formalism is based on the free - energy - minimization technique ( cf .",
    "graboske , harwood & rogers 1969 ) and can be synthesized by writing , for each chemical species , the lte ( local thermodynamic equilibrium ) population of an internal state i ( @xmath13 ) relative to the total particle density ( @xmath14 ) of this species as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the so - called occupation probability of level @xmath17 , @xmath18 the statistical weight , @xmath19 the excitation energy , @xmath20 the internal partition function , @xmath21 the boltzmann constant and @xmath22 the gas temperature .",
    "factors @xmath16 are given by partial derivation of a non - ideal term @xmath23 in the helmholtz free energy of the gas , @xmath24 the probabilistic interpretation of @xmath16 allows hummer and mihalas to combine the action of statistically independent interactions .",
    "they have considered two types of perturbations .",
    "one of them is the excluded volume interaction ( also called perturbation by neutral particles ) , which arises from the finite size of particles with bound electronic states .",
    "these perturbations are taken into account through the second virial coefficient in the van der waals equation of state , which implies an occupation probability of the form @xmath25 \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sum runs over all species @xmath26 having bound levels , @xmath27 and @xmath28 being the effective interaction radii of involved particles .",
    "the other type of perturbation of atomic levels is due to charged species . in the hummer - mihalas formalism",
    ", these perturbations are calculated from a fit to a quantum mechanical stark ionization theory .",
    "this yields an occupation probability that can be formally expressed as @xmath29 which is a fit over the distribution of the electric field strength @xmath30 arising from the charged particles .",
    "originally , the holtsmark distribution was adopted as the micro - field distribution function . however",
    ", this distribution does not take into account the correlations of the charged perturbers .",
    "a more appropriated distribution , which includes correlation effects , was presented by nayfonov et al .",
    "the numerical fits given by nayfonov et al . to compute @xmath31 have been adopted in our calculations .",
    "finally , assuming statistically independent perturbations , the joint occupation probability of an atomic state is the product of @xmath32 and @xmath31 .    in our calculations",
    "the atmospheric gas is assumed to be composed by `` bound '' species ( particles with electronic structure ) h , h@xmath0 ,",
    "h@xmath33 , h@xmath34 , h@xmath35 , he and he@xmath36 , and `` bare '' particles h@xmath37 , he@xmath38 and e@xmath39 .",
    "the energy levels for bound particles have been chosen to be those of the isolated atom or molecule .",
    "eigenenergy shifts could be expected as the density is raised . however , according to experimental measurements ( e.g. weise , kelleher & paquette 1972 ) , unperturbed energy levels is a good approximation at low densities ( @xmath40 ) and seems reasonable at higher densities ( saumon & chabrier 1991 ) .",
    "characteristic atomic and molecular radii are required in order to evaluate the excluded volume perturbations .",
    "the equivalent hard sphere radii ( in  ) for h@xmath0 and h are computed from lineal fits to results of saumon & chabrier ( 1991 , fig .",

    "radii for excited states are obtained by simple scaling laws .",
    "the molecular hydrogen h@xmath0 is represented by 193 vibration - rotational states with energy values calculated from the expression given by herzberg ( 1950 ) , which includes anharmonicity corrections , deviations from rigid rotator approximation , and vibration - rotation coupling .",
    "excited electronic states of h@xmath0 are above the ground state by more than 11 ev , so they can be safely neglected .",
    "effective radii for vibration - rotational states were calculated following mihalas et al . (",
    "1988 ) , i.e. , the equations ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) of vardya ( 1965 ) were solved for each state .",
    "these radii were then scaled to ground radius ( eq . [ rh2 ] ) .",
    "the neutral helium is represented by 144 ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) states ( @xmath46 ) , with energy values for @xmath47 based on the data by martin ( 1973 ) . for @xmath48 , energies ( in ev )",

    "( [ ehe ] ) is a fit to martin s data for @xmath51 and its extrapolation to @xmath48 has an estimated error lower than 10@xmath52 ev .",

    "however , we can expect that he radius is greater than he@xmath37 radius due to its smaller binding energy .",
    "therefore , we adopted for he ground state a radius of 0.50  as used by mihalas et al .",
    "we rescaled the radii of he excited states according to this @xmath58 value .    for the atomic hydrogen we used 100 energy levels calculated in the standard form , and the effective radii",

    "some words are in order .",
    "saumon & chabrier ( 1991 ) found that non - linear contributions to the configuration free energy ( based on fluid perturbation theory ) are necessary to yield the pressure dissociation of h@xmath0 molecules , such as it is expected in a hydrogen gas at high density ( @xmath74 g/@xmath12 ) .",
    "they also show that a simple excluded volume interaction ( such as that used in our gas model ) can not lead to pressure ionization .",

    "therefore , it seems essential to include non - linear contributions in the configuration energy ( besides the occupation probability formalism ) of the gas for a proper treatment of pressure dissociation .",

    "in order to compute the mass loss rates , angular momentum losses due to magnetic braking , gravitational wave emission and mass loss were taken into account ( see sarna , ergma & antipova 2000 ) . in broad outline ,",
    "the evolution of the 0.148 and 0.160 m@xmath3 he wd models is qualitatively similar to that of the lowest stellar mass model analysed in serenelli et al .",
    "indeed , they are characterized by the absence of hydrogen thermonuclear flashes even when element diffusion is allowed to operate .",
    "the lack of thermonuclear flashes forces the evolution of the star to be dominated by stable nuclear burning over most of the entire evolution of these models . as a result",
    ", they are characterized by very long cooling ages .",
    "another resemblance with the lowest mass models of serenelli et al .",
    "( 2001 ) is the fact that although diffusion proceeds much more slowly than in more massive models , the outer layers become pure hydrogen on time - scales shorter than evolutionary time - scales . the evolution of these very low mass he wd models in the colour - magnitude diagrams is depicted in figs . [ f : mv_uv ] and [ f : mv_vi ] .",
    "observational data of the he wd star detected , as companion to a millisecond pulsar ( msp ) , in 47 tucanae by edmonds et al .",
    "( 2001 ) is included in figs .",
    "[ f : mv_uv ] and [ f : mv_vi ] , where this star is denoted by u. from the ( @xmath107 ) diagram we infer a mass slightly higher than 0.17  m@xmath3 for this star , and from ( @xmath108 ) diagram a value somewhat lower than 0.16  m@xmath3 .",
    "the pulsar characteristic age of 2 gyr ( see edmonds et al . 2001 and references cited therein )",
    "is consistent with the age derived for the wd from our theretical models , particularly if the low mass value ( 0.16  m@xmath3 ) , which yield 2 - 2.5 gyr , is adopted .",
    "a lower value for the age is obtained for a 0.17  m@xmath3 model , resulting in a wd younger than its msp companion .",
    "evolution time - scales for these low mass he wds which do not suffer from thermonuclear flashes ( althaus et al .",
    "2001 ) however , are dominated by hydrogen burning and in this regard we must recall that metallicity of the wd progenitor can play an important role .",
    "he wd models presented in this work were derived from @xmath4 progenitors and , given that @xmath109=-0.76 $ ] for 47 tuc , caution must be taken when trying to infer the age for this he wd with the present models .    in fig .",
    "[ f : mv_vi ] we also show the six he wd candidates found in ngc 6397 by taylor et al . ( 2001 ) .",
    "absolute magnitudes were obtained by using @xmath110 and @xmath96 was dereddened by using e(@xmath111 and extinction laws for wfpc2 filters given by holtzman et al .",
    "the three brightest stars of the observed sequence are located between our 0.169 and 0.196 m@xmath3 evolutionary sequences in fig .",
    "[ f : mv_vi ] suggesting that these stars could be @xmath112  m@xmath3 he wds , whilst the three dimmest ones of that sequence are compatible with he wds with stellar masses between 0.16 and 0.17 m@xmath3 .",
    "another interesting aspect of our sequences are the ages involved . according to our predictions",
    ", the age for the three brightest stars would be @xmath113 1 gyr .",
    "on the other hand the dimmest stars seem to be very old objects , older than 8 gyr in all cases and even 10 gyr for the dimmest one .",
    "ngc  6397 is a very metal poor globular cluster @xmath114 , thus models with a much lower metallicity would help give a more detailed understanding of the observations , since both mass and age determinations could be affected ( e.g. , the mass threshold for the ocurrence of thermonuclear flashes is a function of the metallicity of the progenitor thus affecting age determinations even if the wd mass is known ) . in this regard work",
    "is in progress to provide a full grid of he wd models for different metallicities ( serenelli et al .",
    "recently , townsley & bildsten ( 2002 ) have suggested that the three dimmest he wd candidates reported by taylor et al . could be co wds that accrete matter from a 0.15 m@xmath3 main sequence companion at an average rate of @xmath115 m@xmath116 .",
    "additional observations will be necessary to disentangle this issue .    0.2 cm    0.2 cm",
    "we have presented new computed spectra , colour - magnitude and colour - colour diagrams for cooling sequences of helium - core white dwarf ( wd ) stars .",
    "these models include more detailed physics entering the atmosphere calculations .",
    "non - ideal effects were carefully taken into account in the computation of the chemical equilibrium of mixed hydrogen and helium gases , using the occupation formalism of hummer & mihalas ( 1988 ) .",
    "we also included a modified version of the optical simulation of dppen et al .",
    "( 1987 ) to compute opacities in non - ideal gases . from these improvements and the evaluation of line opacity from lyman , balmer and pashen series , we determine more realist atmosphere models of he wds at both early and advanced stages of the cooling .",
    "results from our earlier he wd calculations are confirmed , but a detailed comparison reveals some important quantitative differences . a clear advantage of the newer treatment is the improved behaviour of the emergent flux , especially in hot wds ( @xmath117 k ) , where the line blanketing and balmer pseudo - continuum process yields substantial differences in ultraviolet and optical regions as compared with our previous calculations , affecting colours in @xmath118 photometry .",
    "the use of a non - ideal gas model and up - to - date collision - induced opacities has also allowed a more reliable calculation of cool wd spectra ( @xmath119 k ) .",
    "we extended our he wd model grid by computing cooling sequences for stellar masses of 0.148 and 0.160 m@xmath3 .",
    "comparison of the colours evaluated for our sequence of models with recent observational data from he wd candidates in the cluster ngc 6397 reported by taylor et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and the he wd companion to a millisecond pulsar in 47 tucanae observed by edmonds et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , allow us to infer low mass values for these objets ( ranging from 0.16 up to 0.19 m@xmath3 ) . in the case of 47 tuc",
    ", our age prediction for the he wd ( @xmath120  gyr ) agrees reasonably well with the pulsar characteristic age ( 2 gyr ) .",
    "however , given the low metalliticy of these clusters , a grid of he wd models with low metallicity progenitors is needed in order to contrast these and future observations with model predictions .",
    "with the present extensive and physically sound grid of he wd , we provide a better understanding of the spectral evolution of low mass wds .",
    "our resulting he wd models are particularly useful for interpretive data of very low - mass wds within the current detectability limit , allowing to determine their physical parameters ( mass , age , temperature ) , and to constrain those of their possible binary companions .",
