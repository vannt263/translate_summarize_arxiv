    "thus the value of exchange coupling parameter for a pair with shortest interatomic distance could be 2 - 3 times stronger than for a pair of atoms with larger interatomic distance .",
    "a typical example of such systems is r@xmath4fe@xmath5 class of intermetallic compounds .",

    "based on band structure calculations within the lsda+u method the exchange interaction parameter value for dumbbell pair in the hexagonal phase gd@xmath4fe@xmath5 gives ferromagnetic exchange with @xmath10(1)=238.8  k for a distance @xmath11(1)=2.400.@xcite while for fe3-fe3 pairs in the 12j wyckoff positions for a distance of @xmath12(1)=2.400  corresponding exchange parameter value is found to be @xmath13(1)=80.4  k.@xcite analogous calculations for rhombohedral phase of gd@xmath4fe@xmath5 for fe1-fe1 dumbbell pair gives ferromagnetic coupling with @xmath10(1)=287.5  k ( @xmath11(1)=2.385  ).@xcite for the next pair interatomic distance fe2-fe3 ( 9d and 18f wychoff positions correspondingly ) we obtained @xmath14(1)=87.1  k ( @xmath15(1)=2.423  )@xcite . thus one can see that coupling for dumbbell positions is 3 times stronger ( in both phases ) than an exchange coupling for the next smallest pair interatomic fe - fe distance .",
    "let us note that these strong exchange bonds @xmath10(1 ) of fe1-fe1 dumbbell positions are rather well spatially separated one from each other ( rather diluted ) and do not form any infinite magnetic cluster .",
    "moreover these strongly coupled dumbbell pairs one can consider as some ferromagnetic dimers embedded into a infinite magnetic cluster formed by other weaker magnetic bonds .    to this end",
    "there rises a question : how strong influences presence of such diluted ferromagnetic dimers on a curie temperature ?",
    "well could be that such dimers give dominating contribution to the curie temperature of a complex magnetic system described above .",
