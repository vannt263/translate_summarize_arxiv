    "experimental studies of quantum phase transitions  @xcite in systems of cold atoms in traps , with an imposed optical lattice , have led to a renewal of interest in theoretical studies of lattice models of interacting bosons  @xcite .",
    "examples of such transitions include one from a superfluid ( sf ) to a bosonic mott - insulator ( mi ) .",
    "this transition was predicted by mean - field theories , such as those of refs .",
    "@xcite , and obtained in monte - carlo simulations  @xcite of the bose - hubbard model before it was realized experimentally .",
    "in addition to the optical - lattice potential , a confining potential , most often quadratic , is present in all cold - atom experiments .",
    "this leads to inhomogeneities in the phases that are obtained : simulations  @xcite of the bose - hubbard model , with such a confining potential , and experiments  @xcite on interacting bosons in optical lattices , with a confining potential , have both seen alternating shells of sf and mi regions .",
    "mean - field theories for the bose - hubbard model were first developed for the homogeneous case  @xcite .",
    "these theories were then extended to the inhomogeneous case  @xcite to develop an understanding of the bose - glass phase in the disordered bose - hubbard model . in recent work  @xcite",
    "we have shown how the effects of such a confining potential can be treated , at the level of mean - field theory , as was done in the bose - glass case  @xcite ; in particular , we have provided a natural framework for understanding alternating sf and mi shells , mentioned above . here",
    "we extend this inhomogeneous mean - field theory to account for the different types of phases , sf , mi , density - wave ( dw ) , and supersolid ( ss ) , which can occur in the extended bose - hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "the principal motivation for undertaking such a study of the extended bose - hubbard model is provided by the experiments that have obtained a dipolar condensate of @xmath3 atoms  @xcite . to understand these experiments we must study lattice models of bosons with long - range interactions  @xcite and not merely the bose - hubbard model with a repulsive interaction between bosons on the same lattice site .",
    "the simplest model that goes beyond such onsite interactions is the extended bose - hubbard model , which allows for repulsive interactions between bosons on nearest - neighbor sites and the aforementioned onsite interaction .",
    "in addition to sf and mi phases of the bose - hubbard model , this extended model can have a density wave ( dw ) phase , in which the mean density of bosons is different on the two sublattices of the hypercubic lattices we consider , and a super - solid ( ss ) phase ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "before we present the details of our study , we summarize our principal results . we first develop a mean - field theory for the homogeneous , extended bose - hubbard model by developing on the work of our group on bose - hubbard models for the spinless and spin-1 cases  @xcite ; this yields the sf , mi , dw , and ss phases and the transitions between them , which have been studied by a gutzwiller - type approximation  @xcite that is akin to , but not the same as , our mean - field theory .",
    "we then develop an inhomogeneous mean - field theory for the inhomogeneous extended , bose - hubbard model by generalizing our inhomogeneous mean - field theory for the bose - hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "in particular , when we use a quadratic confining potential in three dimensions ( 3d ) , our theory yields inhomogeneous phases with spherical shells of sf , mi , dw , and ss states .",
    "the precise way in which these phases alternate depends on the parameters of the model ; we study a few illustrative cases explicitly for which we present order - parameter profiles and their fourier transforms .",
    "we also discuss the experimental implications of our work .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : modelmft ] we introduce the inhomogeneous extended bose - hubbard model and then develop an inhomogeneous mean - field theory for it . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we present the results of our mean - field theory .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] contains concluding remarks ; here we give a brief comparison of our work with earlier studies and we explore the experimental implications of our study .",
    "we study the inhomogeneous , extended bose - hubbard model that is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the amplitude for a boson to hop from site @xmath6 to its nearest - neighbor site @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the nearest - neighbor coordination number , @xmath9 are nearest - neighbor pairs of sites , @xmath10 denotes the hermitian conjugate , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are , respectively , boson creation , annihilation , and number operators at the site @xmath6 , the repulsive potential between bosons on the same site is @xmath1 , the chemical potential @xmath13 controls the number of bosons at the site @xmath6 , and @xmath2 is the repulsive interaction between bosons on nearest - neighbor sites . in the inhomogeneous case ,",

    "@xcite , which we follow in our mean - field treatment below . in this paper",
    ", we set @xmath21 , i.e. , we measure all energies in units of @xmath22 .    if @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the model  ( [ eq : ebhmodel ] ) exhibits ( a ) mi phases , which have an integral number of bosons per site , or ( b ) dw phases , in which bosons preferentially occupy one of the sublattices , say @xmath25 , of the bipartite , hypercubic lattices we consider ; the mi phases are favored at large values of @xmath1 whereas the dw phases appear if @xmath2 is large . a variety of dw phases",
    "are possible ; we denote them by dw m/2 ; here m is the number of atoms per unit cell and 2 denotes that the unit cell is doubled , i.e. , the length of its side is 2 . for example , when @xmath23 and @xmath26 , the dw 1/2 phase has 1 boson on sublattice @xmath25 and none on sublattice @xmath27 ( or vice versa ) ; in dw 3/2 there is 1 boson on sublattice @xmath25 and 2 on sublattice @xmath27 ( or vice versa ) .",
    "if @xmath24 but @xmath28 , sf or ss phases can be stabilised because the bosons can hop through the lattice .",
    "nonuniform states appear when we allow @xmath29 as we show below via our inhomogeneous mean - field theory .",
    "we now generalize the intuitively appealing mean - field theory of ref .",
    "@xcite , which has been developed for the homogeneous bose - hubbard model and then extended to the inhomogeneous case in refs .",
    "our generalization introduces order parameters that are capable of distinguishing between dw , ss , sf , and mi phases .",
    "conventional mean - field theories introduce a decoupling scheme that reduces a model with interacting bosons or fermions to an effective , noninteracting problem , which can be solved easily because the effective hamiltonian is quadratic in boson or fermion operators .",
    "by contrast , the mean - field theories of refs .",
    "@xcite , for the case @xmath30 , decouple the hopping term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ebhmodel ] ) , which is quadratic in boson operators , to obtain an effective , one - site hamiltonian , which can be diagonalized numerically . to generalize this to the case @xmath31",
    ", we have to decouple the number operators in the extended bose - hubbard term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ebhmodel ] ) .",
    "in particular , we decouple the first and third terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ebhmodel ] ) to obtain an effective one - site problem , which neglects quadratic deviations from equilibrium values ( denoted by angular brackets ) .",
    "the two approximations we use are as follows : @xmath32 here the superfluid order parameter and the local density for the site @xmath6 are , respectively , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively . the approximation  ( [ eq : decoup ] )",
    "can now be used to write the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : ebhmodel ] ) as a sum over single - site , mean - field hamiltonians @xmath35 as follows : @xmath36 where the superscript @xmath37 stands for mean field , and @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 labels the @xmath8 nearest neighbors of the site @xmath6 .",
    "this form of the single - site , mean - field hamiltonian is suitable for the inhomogeneous case with @xmath41 .    for the homogeneous case , we note that the hypercubic lattices we consider are bipartite , i.e. , they can be divided into two sublattices @xmath25 and @xmath27 .",
    "each site on the @xmath25 ( @xmath27 ) sublattice has @xmath8 nearest neighbors each one of which belongs to the @xmath27 ( @xmath25 ) sublattice . thus , if @xmath26 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 if @xmath44 and @xmath45 and @xmath46 if @xmath47 , whereas @xmath48 and @xmath49 if @xmath44 and @xmath50 and @xmath51 if @xmath47 .",
    "if we require chemical potentials that are conjugate to @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively , we can introduce @xmath54 if @xmath44 and @xmath55 if @xmath56 ; similarly , we can define creation , annihilation , and number operators for each sublattice and hence write the mean - field hamiltonian  ( [ eq : mfham ] ) as follows : @xmath57    @xmath58    @xmath59    if @xmath41 , we first obtain the matrix elements of @xmath35 in the onsite , occupation - number basis @xmath60 , truncated in practice by choosing a finite value for @xmath61 , the total number of bosons per site , for a given initial set of values for @xmath62 .",

    "we then diagonalize this matrix , which depends not just on @xmath67 and @xmath68 , but also on @xmath69 and @xmath70 , to obtain the lowest energy and the corresponding wave function , denoted , respectively , by @xmath71 and @xmath72 ; from these we obtain the new order parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "we then use these new values of @xmath67 and @xmath69 as inputs to reconstruct @xmath35 and repeat the diagonalization procedure until we achieve self consistency of input and output values to obtain the equilibrium values @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( we suppress the superscript @xmath77 hereafter for notational convenience ) .",

    "in this section we present the results of the inhomogeneous mean - field theory that we have developed in the previous section for the extended bose - hubbard model  ( [ eq : ebhmodel ] ) .",
    "we expect that the onsite repulsion between bosons is stronger than the repulsive interaction between bosons on nearest - neighbor sites , so we restrict ourselves to @xmath81 .",
    "we begin with phase diagrams for the homogeneous case with @xmath26 .",

    "the sf phase is favored at small values of @xmath1 . if we hold @xmath0 fixed at low values and increase @xmath1 , the system first undergoes a transition to an ss phase and then to the dw 1/2 phase .",
    "the lobe of the mi1 phase appears above the dw 1/2 lobe and the encompassing sliver of the ss phase ; the next few dw and mi lobes appear as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : homphasediag ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",

    "we now use the inhomogeneous mean - field theory , which we have developed in the previous section , to obtain alternating spherical shells of mi , sf , dw , and ss phases in the 3d , extended bose - hubbard model  ( [ eq : ebhmodel ] ) with a quadratic confining potential .",
    "we do this by obtaining the order - parameter profiles @xmath62 and also by obtaining in - trap density distributions of bosons at different values of @xmath64 , and @xmath0 .",

    "the system moves into a very narrow ss region in which both @xmath69 and @xmath67 are oscillating functions of @xmath108 .",
