    "large - scale datasets generated by dynamical systems arise in a diverse range of disciplines in science and engineering , including fluid dynamics @xcite , materials science @xcite , molecular dynamics @xcite , and geophysics @xcite .",
    "a major challenge in these domains is to utilize the vast amount of data that is being collected by observational networks or output by large - scale numerical models to understand the operating physical processes , and make inferences about aspects of the system which are not accessible to observation .",
    "for instance , in climate atmosphere ocean science ( caos ) the dynamics takes place in an infinite - dimensional phase space where the coupled nonlinear partial differential equations for fluid flow and thermodynamics are defined , and the observed data correspond to functions of that phase space , such as temperature or circulation measured over a geographical region of interest .",
    "there exists a strong need for data analysis algorithms to extract and create reduced representations of the large - scale coherent patterns which are an outcome of these dynamics , including the el nio southern oscillation ( enso ) in the ocean @xcite and the madden - julian oscillation in the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "advances in the scientific understanding and forecasting capability of these phenomena have potentially high socioeconomic impact .    despite the high phase space dimension of many systems of interest ,",
    "their dynamics evolve asymptotically ( at long times ) on low - dimensional submanifolds of phase space ( attractors ) @xcite .",
    "it is therefore natural to exploit topological and geometrical aspects of these submanifolds to design data analysis algorithms for data reduction and decomposition , function learning , and other important problems . here",
    "a major challenge stems from the fact that the geometry of the attractive manifolds is nonlinear , meaning that linear variance - optimizing algorithms such as principal components analysis ( pca ) @xcite or singular spectrum analysis ( ssa ) @xcite are likely to perform suboptimally .",
    "indeed , it has been documented in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) that the dynamically significant modes in nonlinear systems are not necessarily those carrying high variance . moreover , in practical applications involving finite sample counts and short observation intervals , the data manifolds are inherently discrete , and represent only coarse - grained aspects of the underlying geometry at the infinite - sample limit .",
    "kernel methods have been extensively used as alternatives to classical linear algorithms to take advantage of nonlinear geometric structures of data .",
    "prominent applications include dimension reduction and feature extraction @xcite , learning and regularization of scalar or vector - valued functions @xcite , and out - of - sample extension of these functions @xcite . here",
    ", a common theme is that suitably constructed kernels , i.e. , functions measuring a notion of pairwise similarity between data points , lead naturally to diffusion operators which are closely related to the manifold structure of the data .",
    "more specifically , because every elliptical diffusion operator induces a riemannian metric tensor on the data manifold @xcite , using that operator ( or , as is frequently the case , its eigenfunctions ) for tasks such as data representation and function learning is tantamount to performing these tasks in a manner compatible with the induced riemannian geometry . applied to datasets with nonlinear manifold structure , such as those generated by complex dynamical systems , this approach has been found to yield more efficient algorithms and meaningful results than linear pca - type algorithms ( e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a major advantage of constructing diffusion operators through kernels is that kernels are defined in the ambient data space , and thus can be used to control the induced riemannian metric @xcite exploiting features of data space which are available for the problem at hand . in the context of dynamical system data ,",
    "an important feature which is not present in general point clouds is that the samples occur with a time ordering which is the outcome of dynamical flow in phase space .",
    "equivalently , we think of these datasets as being associated with a nowhere - vanishing vector field @xmath0 on the attractor , which is intrinsic to the system under study in the sense that it does not depend on how the data manifold is embedded in ambient space .",
    "these observations provide a motivation to seek aspects of @xmath0 which are empirically accessible in ambient data space , and incorporate them in dynamics - adapted kernels .",
    "efforts in that direction have been made in a series of papers on so - called nonlinear laplacian spectral analysis ( nlsa ) algorithms for decomposition of spatiotemporal data @xcite , and in independent work by berry and collaborators @xcite . in both of these works ,",
    "dynamical flow is incorporated in kernels by first embedding the data in a higher - dimensional space ( hereafter called embedding space ) through takens method of delays @xcite . because each point in embedding space corresponds to a segment of dynamical evolution observed over a temporal window ,",
    "distances in that space depend on the dynamical flow generating the data .",
    "this means in turn that the induced riemannian metric associated with a kernel formulated in embedding space will depend ( albeit indirectly ) on the dynamical system generating the data .    in nlsa algorithms ,",
    "the embedding - space distances are scaled by a factor which is proportional to the distance between temporal nearest neighbors . as will be made precise below",
    ", the displacement vector between temporal nearest neighbors is a representation of the dynamical vector field , pushed forward to embedding space .",
    "therefore , in addition to time - lagged embedding , the nlsa kernel also depends directly on the dynamical vector field through its norm .",
    "qualitatively , the result of this dynamics - dependent scaling factor is to assign higher weights to transitory states with large phase space velocity .",
    "this feature was found to be particularly useful in extracting dynamically significant modes in systems with metastability @xcite . moreover , because of the `` non - dimensionalization '' produced by the scaling factor , the nlsa kernel can be naturally extended to process multivariate datasets consisting of components with different physical units @xcite . yet , in spite of these attractive features , theoretical understanding of the role of the scaling factor in the induced riemannian metric has so far been lacking .",
    "building on the existing work in @xcite , in this paper we introduce a one - parameter family of kernels which , besides the norm of the dynamical vector field also depend on the angle between that vector field and the displacement vector between the points at which the kernel is evaluated .",
    "in particular , the new kernels assign higher weight to pairs of points whose relative displacement lies within a cone with axis parallel to the dynamical vector field . for this reason we refer to the new kernels as cone kernels .",
    "the angular influence is controlled by a parameter @xmath1 , such that the existing nlsa kernel with no angular dependence occurs as the special case @xmath2 .    here , however , our main focus is the limiting behavior @xmath3 , where the angular influence is maximal . in that limit ,",
    "the induced riemannian metric becomes degenerate , and diffusion takes place along the integral curves of the dynamical vector field @xmath0 ( in the sense of @xcite ) . because the dynamical integral curves are intrinsic to the system ( i.e. , do not depend on the ambient - space induced metric ) , the along-@xmath0 property of the @xmath3 diffusion operator is invariant under arbitrary diffeomorphisms of the data manifold .",
    "moreover , the associated dirichlet form depends on the directional derivative of functions along @xmath0 , which is also metric independent .",
    "in fact , the only dependence of the limit operator on the ambient - space metric is through a ratio involving its volume form and the norm of @xmath0 . by virtue of this property , as @xmath3 , the diffusion operators constructed from cone kernels become invariant under a weakly restrictive class of transformations of the data , which includes conformal transformations as a special case .",
    "in addition , due to the structure of the dirichlet form , the associated diffusion eigenfunctions are expected to vary predominantly along directions transverse to @xmath0 .",
    "these eigenfunctions can therefore be employed to carry out tasks such as dimension reduction and feature extraction in a dynamics - adapted manner .",
    "we demonstrate the utility of cone kernels in two applications involving analytically solvable nonlinear flows on the 2-torus and dynamical evolution of sea surface temperature ( sst ) in the north pacific ocean in a comprehensive climate model . in the torus application",
    ", we explicitly demonstrate the adaptation of the eigenfunctions of the associated diffusion operator to the dynamical flow , and invariance of these eigenfunctions under a non - conformal deformation of the torus .",
    "the climate model results suggest that the cone - kernel eigenfunctions produce more efficient ( i.e. , using fewer basis functions ) representation of the temporal variability compared to the existing nlsa kernel , while achieving better timescale separation .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section  [ secconekernels ]",
    ", we lay out the notation , and develop the cone kernel formulation . in section  [ secasymptotics ]",
    ", we study the behavior of the induced metric and the associated diffusion operator .",
    "we present the applications to torus flows and climate model data in sections  [ sectorus ] and  [ secgcm ] , respectively , and conclude in section  [ secconclusions ] .",
    "technical results and proofs are included in an appendix .",
    "a movie illustrating the time evolution of sst filtered by diffusion eigenfunctions is provided as supplemental material .",
    "a matlab code used to generate the numerical results in sections  [ sectorus ] and  [ secgcm ] is available upon request from the author .",
    "we consider a scenario where the dynamics is described by a deterministic flow @xmath4 operating in a phase space @xmath5 , and evolving on a smooth ( of class @xmath6 ) , compact @xmath7-dimensional attractor @xmath8 without boundary .",
    "moreover , observations are taken uniformly in time with a timestep @xmath9 on the attractor via a @xmath10 vector - valued function @xmath11 , leading to a dataset @xmath12 see figure  [ figmanifold ] for an illustration .",
    "we refer to @xmath13 interchangeably as data space or ambient space , and consider that it is equipped with an inner product @xmath14 .    throughout",
    ", we assume that @xmath15 is sufficiently smooth so that the dynamical vector field @xmath0 induced on @xmath16 , defined through @xmath17 is at least @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath19 is one - to - one , and has full rank on the tangent spaces of @xmath16 ; i.e. , @xmath19 is an embedding of @xmath16 into @xmath13 ( if @xmath19 is not an embedding , it is generically possible to construct an embedding through delay - coordinate maps @xcite ) . under these conditions ,",
    "the observation map generates a vector field @xmath20 on @xmath21 through its derivative @xmath22 , viz .",
    "we denote by @xmath24 the riemannian metric induced on @xmath16 by pulling back the ambient - space inner product , giving @xmath25 for any two tangent vectors @xmath26 .    even though we do not attempt to extend the analysis presented here to non - smooth manifolds , we note work of sauer et al .",
    "@xcite , who prove embedding theorems for dynamical systems with fractal attractors .",
    "moreover , in section  [ secdiscreteformulation ] we pass to an intrinsically discrete formulation , where the existence of an underlying smooth continuous theory is not required .",
    "next , consider how linear combinations of @xmath27 can be used to construct finite - difference ( fd ) approximations of @xmath20 . in particular , let @xmath28 be a @xmath29-th order fd operator for the first derivative of a function , @xmath30 we then have the following lemma .",
    "[ lemmafd ] the vector in data space @xmath31 corresponds to an @xmath32-accurate fd approximation of the pushforward of the dynamical vector field @xmath0 evaluated at @xmath33 , in the sense that @xmath34 moreover , the data space norm @xmath35 provides an @xmath32 approximation to the norm of @xmath36 with respect to the induced metric , namely @xmath37    a proof of this lemma is included in appendix  [ appfd ] .",
    "hereafter , we nominally work with a central fd scheme , @xmath38 where @xmath39 are standard fd weights for central schemes ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , the asymptotic analysis in section  [ secasymptotics ] only depends on the fd accuracy , and also applies , e.g. , for backward and forward schemes .",
    "recall now that a kernel is a symmetric function @xmath40 which maps pairs of states in @xmath16 to a positive number , and , in practical applications , depends only on quantities observed in data space through @xmath19 .",
    "a standard choice in this context is the isotropic gaussian kernel @xcite , @xmath41 here , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are a positive parameter and the displacement vector between data samples @xmath27 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "having established the association between @xmath45 and @xmath46 in lemma  [ lemmafd ] , we seek to modify @xmath47 to incorporate information about the dynamical vector field through ( i ) its norm @xmath48 with respect to the induced metric estimated via  ; ( ii ) its angle relative to @xmath43 , estimated via @xmath49 specifically , introducing a parameter @xmath1 , we define @xmath50^{1/2 } \\right).\\ ] ] for @xmath2 , the kernel in   reduces to the locally scaled kernel employed in nlsa algorithms @xcite , which features no dependence on the angle between @xmath43 and the phase space velocity vectors , @xmath45 and @xmath51 . on the other hand , as @xmath52 approaches 1 , @xmath53 assigns higher affinity to data samples whose relative displacement vector is aligned with either @xmath45 and/or @xmath51 .",
    "for this reason , we term this two - parameter family of kernels cone kernels .",
    "for the remainder of this section we discuss certain properties of cone kernels which will be useful for the asymptotic analysis in section  [ secasymptotics ] .",
    "as is evident from the structure of  , the scaling of the pairwise distances @xmath54 by @xmath55 results in greater similarity being ascribed to transitory states characterized by large norm of the dynamical vector field . in @xcite ,",
    "this feature was found to be crucial for successful dimensional reduction of a dynamical system with chaotic metastability . in section  [ secasymptotics ] ,",
    "we give a geometrical interpretation of the scaling factor showing that the metric tensor induced on @xmath16 through @xmath56 is invariant under conformal transformations of the data as a result of this scaling .",
    "in addition , cone kernels with @xmath57 provide superior discrimination by assigning greater similarity to those sample pairs whose relative displacement vector is aligned with the dynamical flow . more specifically , given two distinct data samples @xmath58 and @xmath59 with @xmath60 , the ratio @xmath61^{1/2 } \\leq 1\\ ] ] grows exponentially as @xmath62 whenever @xmath63 and @xmath64 are both not equal to unity .",
    "an outcome of this property is that the corresponding diffusion operator @xmath65 generates diffusions along the integral curves of the dynamical vector field @xmath0 @xcite in the sense that , asymptotically as @xmath3 , @xmath66 vanishes whenever the gradient of @xmath67 is parallel to @xmath0 .",
    "because these curves are intrinsic to the dynamical system generating the data , this property does not depend on the observation function @xmath19 and the associated induced metric in  , so long as @xmath19 meets the conditions of a manifold embedding @xcite .",
    "we also mention the utility of cone kernels in situations where @xmath19 is a composite map , @xmath68 , such that @xmath69 where both @xmath70 and @xmath71 are embeddings .",
    "this scenario arises in practice when one has access to multivariate observations with distinct physical units , but there is no natural way of choosing a norm for the product space @xmath72 . because the ratio @xmath73 is invariant under scaling of the data by a constant ( including change of units ) , cone kernels computed individually for @xmath70 and @xmath71 can be combined into a single product kernel without having to introduce additional scaling parameters .",
    "a climate science application of this technique can be found in @xcite .",
    "the metric tensor induced at a reference point @xmath74 on the data manifold by an exponentially decaying kernel depends strongly on the local rate of decay of the kernel at @xmath74 . as established by berry  @xcite , in many cases of interest , including the isotropic gaussian kernel in   and the cone kernel in  , that rate is controlled to leading order by the hessian ( second derivative ) matrix of the kernel with respect to a coordinate patch covering the reference point , as we now discuss .    fixing a basepoint @xmath75 ,",

    "in general , the eigenfunctions can be grouped into three families according to the timescales present in the @xmath257 time series , which we refer to as periodic , low - frequency , and intermittent @xcite .",

    "the periodic eigenfunctions come in doubly - degenerate pairs , and are dominated by a single frequency component which is an integer multiple of the annual cycle . due to the presence of strong seasonality",
    ", one would expect the data manifold to have the structure of a circle along one of its dimensions  the presence of the periodic eigenfunctions is consistent with this picture .",

    "the intermittent eigenfunctions have the structure of amplitude - modulated wavetrains consisting of a periodic carrier signal with integer frequency multiples of the seasonal cycle , which is modulated by a low - frequency envelope . in certain cases ( though not always ) the low - frequency envelope is correlated strongly with a low - frequency eigenfunction . in figure",
    "[ figccsmphicone ] , for instance , the low - frequency envelopes of the intermittent eigenfunctions @xmath272 , @xmath273 , and @xmath274 correlate strongly with the low - frequency eigenfunctions @xmath275 ,",
    "@xmath276 , and @xmath277 , respectively .    similarly to the periodic eigenfunctions , the intermittent eigenfunctions arise in near - degenerate pairs ( see figure  [ figccsmlambda ] ) .",
    "the corresponding spatiotemporal patterns [ panels ( c ) , ( d ) , ( g ) , and ( h ) in figure  [ figccsmsnapshot ] and movie  1 ] feature propagating structures in regions of the north pacific with high variability , including the kuroshio current , the bering sea , and the west coast of north america .",
    "these patterns carry approximately two orders of magnitude less variance of the raw data than the prominent low - frequency modes . as a result , they are not accessible to variance - greedy pca - type algorithms .",
    "however , these eigenfunctions are crucial in explaining the lagged temporal correlation structure of the data in so - called anomaly reemergence mechanisms @xcite , and have also been found to have high skill as external factors in regression models for sst variability @xcite .      the periodic , low - frequency , and",
    "intermittent families arise in both of the @xmath2 and 0.995 kernels .",
    "as is evident in figures  [ figccsmphiat ] and  [ figccsmphicone ] , there exists a reasonably clear qualitative correspondence between the leading eigenfunctions in each case .",
    "nevertheless , the two spectra differ in two important aspects .",
    "first , the number of eigenfunctions required to capture the prominent features described in section  [ secsstfeatures ] is significantly smaller in the @xmath241 case than the @xmath2 example . in particular , it takes 17 @xmath241 eigenfunctions to describe the annual and semiannual cycles , the pdo , enso , and npgo low - frequency modes , and the associated intermittent modes , versus 26 @xmath2 eigenfunctions .",
    "the extra eigenfunctions contained in the @xmath2 spectrum are generally associated with higher harmonics of the seasonal cycle , which appear to be of limited physical significance .",
    "examples of these harmonics can be seen in the eigenvalue spectrum of figure  [ figccsmlambda ] , where the annual and semiannual periodic eigenfunctions ( @xmath278@xmath279 ) are followed by higher harmonics all the way to the nyquist limit @xmath280 y@xmath281 associated with the one - month sampling interval .",
    "higher - frequency harmonics are also present in the intermittent eigenfunctions .",
    "the suppression of the high - frequency harmonics from the @xmath241 spectrum is consistent with the observation made in section  [ seceigenfunctions ] that large gradients of the eigenfunctions along the direction of the dynamical vector field @xmath0 lead to large dirichlet form in  , and correspondingly large eigenvalues . because a major component of @xmath0 is due to the annual cycle",
    ", the higher - harmonics incur a large @xmath282 penalty , and thus are removed from the leading part of the spectrum .",
    "we expect this to be a generic feature in datasets with prominent quasi - periodic behavior .",
    "a further key difference between the @xmath2 and @xmath241 eigenfunctions pertains to timescale separation . in particular , as can be seen in figure  [ figccsmphiat ] , the @xmath283 eigenfunction for @xmath2 representing the npgo exhibits a mixture of interannual and annual timescales .",
    "likewise , @xmath284 has a mixed intermittent  low - frequency character .",
    "on the other hand , the corresponding @xmath241 eigenfunctions in figure  [ figccsmphicone ] ( @xmath277 and @xmath273 , respectively ) have a well - separated temporal character , with @xmath277 acting as a low - frequency envelope of @xmath274 . in consequence ,",
    "the corresponding spatiotemporal patterns have larger amplitude and feature more prominent intermittent coherent structures ; see , e.g. , the portion of the dynamic evolution around simulation year 207 in figure  [ figccsmsnapshot ] and movie  1 .",
    "again , we attribute this behavior to the superior adaptation of the @xmath241 eigenfunctions to the dynamical flow .",
    "in this work , we have developed a family of kernels for data analysis in dynamical systems , which incorporate empirical information about the dynamical flow in phase space .",
    "compared to canonical isotropic gaussian kernels , the kernels presented here assign higher affinity to pairs of data samples whose relative displacement vector lies on a small - angle cone with axis parallel to the dynamical vector field @xmath0 on the data manifold . the latter is estimated through finite differences of time - ordered samples , i.e. , without requiring prior knowledge of the equations of motion . due to the presence of the angular term , we refer to the new kernels as cone kernels .",
    "cone kernels also feature a scaling factor introduced heuristically in earlier work on so - called nlsa algorithms @xcite , whose role is to locally decrease ( increase ) the rate of decay of the kernel in regions of phase space where the dynamical flow is fast ( slow ) in the sense of the norm @xmath135 of the dynamical vector field in data space .",
    "moreover , the strength of the angular dependence is controlled by a parameter @xmath1 , such that @xmath2 and @xmath3 correspond to zero or maximal influence of the angular term .",
    "thus , cone kernels include the earlier nlsa kernels as the special case @xmath2 .",
    "we evaluated the metric tensor @xmath116 induced on the data manifold by cone kernels ( lemma  [ lemmahmetric ] ) using the asymptotic analysis framework of berry  @xcite , and also studied the associated diffusion operator @xmath65 . by virtue of the @xmath135-dependent",
    "scaling , the induced metric is invariant for all @xmath52 under conformal transformations of the original ambient space metric @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath285 , @xmath116 contracts local distances between points on the data manifold whose relative displacement is parallel to @xmath0 , becoming degenerate as @xmath52 approaches 1 . in that regime , @xmath65 becomes along @xmath0 @xcite , in the sense that the associated codifferential operator asymptotically annihilates all differential 1-forms @xmath118 with the property @xmath144 ( lemma  [ lemmaalong ] ) .",
    "intuitively , one thinks of @xmath65 in the @xmath3 limit as generating diffusions along the integral curves of the dynamical vector field . because @xmath0 and its integral curves do not depend on the ambient space metric , this feature is intrinsic to the dynamical system under study .",
    "more generally , as @xmath3 , the action of @xmath65 on functions depends on the ambient space metric only through the ratio @xmath286 for an @xmath7-dimensional manifold .",
    "the latter is invariant under conformal transformations of @xmath24 , as well as more general transformations .",
    "a further important property arising in the @xmath3 limit is that the dirichlet form associated with @xmath65 depends on the directional derivative of functions along @xmath287 , as opposed to the canonical dependence on the gradient operator [ see  ] .",
    "this property has significant bearing on the structure of the corresponding diffusion eigenfunctions , which are useful in a wide range of dimension reduction , signal processing , and learning problems .",
    "in particular , the leading eigenfunctions are expected to be adapted to the dynamical system generating the data , in the sense of varying weakly along the integral curves of @xmath0 .",
    "we discussed the utility of cone kernels in a suite of numerical experiments involving nonlinear flows on the 2-torus and north pacific sea surface temperature ( sst ) data from a comprehensive climate model . in the torus experiments",
    ", we explicitly demonstrated the adaptivity of the diffusion eigenfunctions associated with @xmath57 cone kernels to the dynamics ( figures  [ figphii ] and  [ figphiii ] ) , as well as the robustness of those eigenfunctions to non - conformal deformations of the data ( figure  [ figphiideformed ] ) . in the north pacific sst experiments ,",
    "cone kernels were found to have superior feature extraction capabilities , in the sense of requiring fewer basis functions than their @xmath2 counterparts to describe the salient coherent structures of north pacific sst variability , while also providing better separation between the timescales associated with the annual solar forcing and low - frequency ( interannual ) variability of the ocean .",
    "we attribute this improvement of skill to the ability of @xmath57 cone kernels to take into account changes in the direction of the dynamical flow due to the annual cycle",
    ". this feature should be generic in datasets with prominent quasiperiodic behavior .",
    "there are several open questions generated by this work which lie outside the scope of the present paper . on the theory side ,",
    "a more detailed understanding of the diffusion eigenfunctions obtained from cone kernels would be desirable ; e.g. , their properties as embedding coordinates @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it would be useful to explore generalizations of the deterministic framework adopted here to stochastic dynamical systems .",
    "such approaches might involve replacing the ambient - space distances and inner products with suitable statistical metrics @xcite , retaining the explicit dependence on aspects related to the drift of the system in phase space . even in the deterministic dynamical system context",
    ", potential shortcomings of cone kernels may arise due to sensitivity to observational noise and/or poor performance of the directional term in high intrinsic dimensions .",
    "such scenarios would warrant modification of the cone kernel formulation put forward here , but we expect the general approach of incorporating empirically accessible information about the dynamics in kernel design to remain fruitful .",
    "this appendix contains the proof of lemmas  [ lemmafd ] , [ lemmahmetric ] , and  [ lemmaalong ] , as well as derivations of a number of results used in the main text .",
