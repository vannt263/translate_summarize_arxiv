    "the remarkable stability of these clusters was argued to depend partly on states of nonzero electric charge @xcite . for particles of nanometer scale ,",
    "such states are dominated by the quantization of charge .",
    "the energy to add a single electron to a particle becomes large on the scale of the thermal energy @xmath3 , so that net charge on a particle is atypical .",
    "thus any net charge on a cluster is necessarily unevenly distributed over its particles .",
    "still , a net charge on one particle must polarize the surrounding particles , producing electrostatic attraction .",
    "this contrasts with the macroscopic case in which the available charge would be shared amongst the particles , producing repulsion .",
    "it is of great interest to understand what types of clusters are favored under this simple and novel binding mechanism .",
    "mutual electrostatic interactions between spherical conductors and with surfaces are of interest in space environments @xcite and in scanning probe microscopy @xcite .",

    ", this electrostatic interaction can not be reduced to a pairwise potential energy .",
    "charge on one sphere induces polarization on each nearby sphere .",
    "this polarization induces further polarization in other spheres , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketches ] .",
    "since their separation is not large compared to their radius , the polarization can not be accurately described by a dipole approximation . instead",
    ", all the spheres carry a polarization charge distribution that must be found self - consistently to minimize the electrostatic energy .",
    "it is not known what types of clusters would be favored by this novel multi - body interaction mechanism .",
    "moore @xcite has provided a multipole formalism for calculating this energy and has explored the energies of simple clusters . recently",

    "middle curves : the charge is equally divided between the two spheres .",
    "lower curves : equal and opposite charges on the two spheres .",
    "a change of sphere radius @xmath7 would change the energy scale in proportion to @xmath8 . ]",

    "et al_. @xcite have been developed .",
    "a case of special interest is that of identical spheres of radius @xmath7 bearing equal and opposite charge @xmath9 at separation @xmath0 . at small separation @xmath10 the charge becomes concentrated arbitrarily strongly near the contact point .",
    "this concentrated contact charge creates a logarithmically singular mutual capacitance @xmath1 of the form @xmath11 ( in electrostatic units @xcite ) , where @xmath12 is a numerical constant .",
    "the resulting electrostatic energy @xmath13 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dimerenergy ] reflects this singular behavior .",
    "this divergent contact charge complicates the treatment of clusters of spheres with different charges .",
    "s recent work on such clusters @xcite shows a non - regular dependence of the energy on separation .",
    "below we investigate the implications of the singular contact charge for the electrostatic energy @xmath14 of clusters of conducting spheres @xmath15 at small separation @xmath0 when the total charge @xmath16 resides on only one sphere , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketches ] .",
    "we contrast this energy with the simpler equipotential case where the charge @xmath16 is allowed to pass freely between the spheres .",
    "then there is no contact charge , and the electrostatic energy @xmath17 varies smoothly with @xmath0 .",
    "however in the case of interest where only one sphere is charged , new behavior arises owing to the appearance of contact charge .",
    "it is necessary to characterize this new behavior in order to find the desired electrostatic energy when the separations @xmath0 are small .",
    "we find that the energy at contact remains finite and equal to @xmath18 , but it acquires a logarithmic correction in @xmath0 : @xmath19 , \\label{eq : announce_result}\\ ] ] where the coefficient @xmath20 is independent of @xmath0 and depends only on position of the extra charge in the cluster , on the equipotential charges and on the topological connectivity of the cluster .",
    "we begin by reviewing the origin of the singular @xmath1 in sec .",
    "[ sec : twospheres ] .",
    "next we define a capacitance matrix @xmath21 that gives the proportionality between the charges @xmath22 and the potentials @xmath23 in sec .",

    "[ sec : asymmetrically ] we separate the regular and singular contributions to @xmath21 to obtain a parameterized expression for small @xmath0 . in sec .  [ sec : energy ] we derive the form shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : announce_result ] ) , valid for asymptotically small @xmath0 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : geometry ] we discuss how this energy is affected by extended versus compact cluster shapes .",
    "because the logarithmic singularity is weak , the regular contributions to @xmath21 become significant for realistic contacts . in sec .",
    "[ sec : examples ] , we determine the leading regular contributions for several simple clusters using a straightforward numerical procedure .",
    "finally we comment on experimental implications and tests .",
    "for completeness we recall the origin of the logarithmic divergence of the mutual capacitance of two neighboring spheres of radius @xmath7 , bearing equal and opposite charges @xmath9 .",
    "the potential difference between the spheres is denoted @xmath24 . in the limit @xmath25 ,",
    "the capacitance is dominated by the adjacent sections of the two spheres .",
    "since the curvature there is very small on the scale of @xmath0 , we may find the capacitance from this region via the derjaguin approximation @xcite .",
    "this approximation treats the system as a set of concentric annular ring capacitors , neglecting the slopes of the surfaces within each ring . at lateral distance @xmath26 from the central axis ,",
    "where the separation is @xmath27 , the electric field @xmath28 is evidently @xmath29 . thus the surface charge density @xmath30 . to find the charge @xmath9",
    ", we integrate @xmath31 : @xmath32 we note that the local height @xmath27 is given by @xmath33 so that @xmath34 . then for @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 where @xmath38 is some upper cutoff of thickness where the derjaguin approximation breaks down .",
    "thus , @xmath39 as claimed . a change in the cutoff parameter @xmath12 has no affect on the singular amplitude ; it only adds a constant independent of @xmath0 .",
    "thus any choice of @xmath12 is equally valid for describing the singular behavior .",
    "we shall arbitrarily take @xmath40 below .",
    "the capacitance @xmath41 thus goes logarithmically to infinity as @xmath42 .",
    "we define the singular part of this capacitance @xmath43 for use below .    from this capacitance",
    "we can infer the energy needed to separate the contacting spheres with charges @xmath44 . at contact ,",
    "the energy @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 . since @xmath47 , we have vanishingly small @xmath4 at contact . at infinite separation",
    "we have the full coulomb self energy @xmath48 .",
    "thus with equal and opposite charges the polarization of the spheres cancels virtually all the electrostatic energy of the separated spheres .",
    "[ fig : dimerenergy ] shows how this singularity influences the exact energy for this case .",
    "we now extend our discussion of charges and potentials to a cluster of @xmath49 spheres labeled by @xmath15 .",
    "we denote the set of charges @xmath22 by the vector @xmath50 .",
    "there is in general a linear relationship between the charges @xmath50 and the potentials on the spheres @xmath51 of the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the @xmath54 symmetric  capacitance matrix \" .    in general the potentials @xmath23 are not equal , so that contacting spheres @xmath15 and @xmath55 acquire a singular contact charge on sphere @xmath15 at its contact with sphere @xmath55 : @xmath56 .",
    "there is in general additional nonsingular charge @xmath57 for any sphere @xmath55 in the cluster , which remains finite as @xmath42 . the total charge on @xmath15 is then given by @xmath58 here the index @xmath59 runs over all the spheres contacting sphere @xmath15 .",

    "in this language we may readily express the electrostatic energy @xmath4 for any charge state @xmath50 : @xmath68    since the @xmath1 term depends only on potential differences , it vanishes whenever @xmath51 is uniform with potential @xmath69 .",
    "this  equipotential state \" is an important starting point for our derivation .",
    "it is convenient to define a `` uniform vector '' @xmath70 .",
    "then in the equipotential state the potentials have the form @xmath71 .",
    "since all spheres have the same potential , there are no contact charges , @xmath72 and @xmath73 . in general the charges @xmath74 for the equipotential cluster are not equal .",
    "these charges @xmath75 depend smoothly on @xmath0 with no singularity as @xmath42 .",
    "the total charge @xmath16 is given by @xmath76 .",
    "for a given total charge @xmath16 , the potential @xmath69 is then given by @xmath77 .",
    "evidently the equipotential capacitance @xmath78 is simply @xmath79 .",
    "it remains to determine how the singular @xmath1 affects the @xmath51 and @xmath4 when the charges are different from @xmath75 .",
    "we note that this problem bears a strong formal resemblance to that of determining contact forces in a weakly compressed mass of droplets @xcite .",
    "when we specify the charges @xmath80 , the potentials must become unequal . then contact charges must appear , and the laplacian matrix @xmath60 becomes important .",
    "first we note that @xmath81 is nonzero for _ all _ nonuniform @xmath51 for the connected clusters considered here @xcite .",
    "thus in the limit of @xmath82 , eq .  ( [ eq : bblplusbbh ] ) implies that any fixed , non - uniform @xmath51 creates diverging charges @xmath50 .",

    "we may separate @xmath51 into its limiting part @xmath85 plus a ( small ) remainder @xmath86 .",

    "we denote the @xmath60 restricted to the @xmath87 and @xmath86 space as @xmath95 .",
    "further , eq .  ( [ eq : qv ] ) is invertible for sufficiently large @xmath1 @xcite : @xmath96 we recall ( sec . [",
    "sec : twospheres ] ) that @xmath1 was only defined up to an arbitrary additive constant .",
    "here we see that this arbitrariness has no physical impact .",
    "if we add a constant @xmath97 to @xmath1 and subtract @xmath98 from @xmath64 , the equation is unchanged .",

    "( [ eq : vq2 ] ) @xmath106 the first term is simply the equipotential energy @xmath107 .",

    "the third term was shown to vanish in eq .",
    "( [ eq : duality ] ) . thus @xmath108    in the limit where @xmath1 is so large that higher orders in @xmath99 can be neglected , this reduces to the form announced in eq .",

    "[ sec : examples ] .",
    "thus the full matrix form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : calefull ] ) is preferable .",
    "this includes all the dependence on @xmath1 but neglects the ( presumed regular ) dependence of @xmath64 on @xmath0 . since these are low - dimensional matrices , the needed operations are straightforward .",
    "( [ eq : calefull ] ) shows that one may isolate the singular part of the electrostatic energy for a cluster of conducting spheres close to contact , using nonsingular quantities which can be readily computed numerically .",
    "the energy at @xmath110 but without conductance between spheres is the same as for the equipotential case where conductance is allowed .",
    "this means that the imposed distribution of charge among the spheres has no effect on the energy when @xmath42 .",

    "in general it depends on which sphere is charged .",
    "a central question arising from this distinctive electrostatic effect is to understand how the shape of the cluster affects its binding energy @xmath115",
    ". clusters with the largest @xmath116 and the strongest binding are expected to be more abundant .",
    "it is natural to ask whether @xmath4 favors compact clusters or extended ones . in the limit @xmath42",
    "there is a clear preference for extended clusters . here",
    "the cluster is an equipotential and is energetically equivalent to a single conducting object with the given total charge .",
    "the favored shape is thus that with highest capacitance to ground and largest spatial extent @xcite .",
    "a cluster of @xmath49 spheres thus has the strongest binding when extended out in a straight line .",
    "however , as shown above , any departure from the @xmath117 limit brings strong changes in @xmath4 .",
    "the derivative of @xmath4 with @xmath0 is infinite at @xmath110 .",
    "thus even small nonzero @xmath0 can have a significant effect on the relative @xmath4 of different clusters .",
    "appendix [ sec : shape_appendix ] argues that the binding penalty from the @xmath99 correction in eq .",
    "( [ eq : oldcale ] ) favors compact clusters over extended ones for large @xmath49 .",
    "moreover , this correction can be strong enough that the net binding is stronger for more compact clusters .",
    "in this section we show explicitly how the two matrices @xmath60 and @xmath64 lead to the @xmath0-dependent coulomb energy @xmath4 for several clusters of interest .",
    "we first consider a regular tetrahedron , planar 4-sphere clusters and a regular octahedron .",

    "one might expect that this attractive mechanism should extend beyond conducting spheres to dielectric spheres , especially if the dielectric contrast is large .",
    "however , the concentration of charge near a contact is qualitatively weaker for dielectrics than for conductors . for dielectrics in an external field ,",
    "the charge density remains finite at contact ; it does not diverge as in the conducting case .",
    "though we have only treated the specific case of clusters of spheres of equal size , the effects explored here apply generally to convex conductors . when any two smoothly curving conductors approach each other , the derjaguin argument of sec .",
    "[ sec : twospheres ] implies a logarithmically diverging mutual capacitance , whose @xmath1 depends only on the mean curvatures of the two adjacent surfaces .    in real materials a net charge on a cluster",
    "is only created in combination with a countercharge elsewhere . in practice",
    "these countercharges may lie close to the cluster and thus modify the coulomb energy significantly .",
    "thus our results only apply when the screening length due to external charge is larger than the cluster .",
    "naturally real clusters like those of fig .",
    "[ fig : micrographs ] experience other forms of interaction unrelated to net charge on the cluster .",
    "the organic coronas @xcite used to to stabilize the particles exert interparticle forces .",
    "so do steric interactions with other neighboring nanoparticles .",
    "dispersion forces and solvent - specific chemical interactions are also present . in order to make reliable predictions of cluster shapes",
    ", one would need to add these conventional interactions to the charge - induced interactions considered here .",
    "experimental consequences of our clustering mechanism could potentially be found in the binary lattices like fig .",
    "[ fig : micrographs ] that motivated our study .",
    "if our mechanism is important , one expects ( a ) cluster shapes with lower electrostatic energy as calculated above should be relatively more prevalent , and ( b ) particles with a thicker ligand layer should be less strongly bound but have greater preference for specific charge sites .",
    "still , the number of competing effects that determine the specific cluster shapes precludes any decisive predictions .",
    "other simpler systems give a brighter prospect for decisive predictions .",
    "one such system is a dilute dispersion of nanoparticles in a nonpolar solvent @xcite .",
    "one may induce charge separation by adding large counterions to the dispersion @xcite .",
    "then any nanoparticle with a net charge will attract neutral nanoparticles via the mechanism described above .",
    "if the counterions are sufficiently large and distant , their effects can be made minor .",
    "then one expects to observe clusters with relative abundance dictated in thermal equilibrium by the electrostatic binding energies described above .",
    "we have shown that the electrostatic energy of a cluster of spherical conductors has a novel form when one conductor is charged and their separations are small . in the limit of small separations the energy is finite , but the corrections to this limit are logarithmically singular .",
    "thus for real clusters where the separation is nonzero , it is important to know the singular contribution .",
    "both the limiting energy and the corrections can be expressed in terms of non - singular operations .",
    "it appears from our numerical examples that these small separations can have a significant impact on the binding of the clusters . in certain situations",
    "as noted above , this distinctive form of binding could be significant in determining the prevalent cluster shapes .",

    "dmitri talapin for numerous discussions of his experimental findings on nanoparticle self - assembly .",
    "we thank toan nguyen , eric dufresne and naomi oppenheimer for insightful discussions .",
    "we thank alexander moore , author of ref .",
    ", for extensive discussions and the use of his algebraic code .",

    "we thank the aspen center for physics for hospitality during part of this work .",

    "jq was supported by the kadanoff - rice fellowship through the university of chicago .",
    "in this appendix we estimate how the coulomb energy of a cluster depends on its overall shape : compact vs extended .",
    "we consider a large cluster of @xmath49 spheres under two extremes of compactness . on the one hand we consider the cluster of least compactness , where all the spheres are extended along a one - dimensional line . on the other hand , we consider the state of maximal compactness in which the spheres form a spherical aggregate of maximum density .",
    "as noted in the main text , the equipotential part of the energy favors extended structures . here",
    "we focus on the leading logarithmic correction to the binding energy @xmath14 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : oldcale ] ) . we denote it as @xmath187 , @xmath188 our interest is in the case where the charge @xmath50 is concentrated in a single sphere .",
    "in both of these clusters , one may use a continuum approach to characterize @xmath60 .",
    "the @xmath60 has a simple interpretation in terms of a quantum system . in this system one",
    "replaces each sphere by a site and each contact by a connecting junction .",
    "the @xmath60 matrix is then the hamiltonian of a quantum particle in this system and its eigenstates are the energy levels . for a homogeneous solid",
    "these eigenstates are the well - known tight - binding states of solid state physics @xcite .",
    "the @xmath49 eigenstates @xmath189 are normalized plane waves of wavevector @xmath190 and eigenvalues of order @xmath191 . using this fact we may write @xmath187 as @xmath192 here sum goes over the @xmath49 distinct wave states compatible with the boundary conditions .",
    "the vectors @xmath87 are constructed to have vanishing projection on the @xmath193 state , so @xmath193 is omitted from this sum .    to compute the sum",
    ", we need to know the dot products @xmath194 .",
    "the @xmath87 is the sum of two parts : @xmath50 and @xmath75 .",
    "we first consider the @xmath50 part , which vanishes except on a particular sphere .",
    "it is the discrete analog of a delta function in space .",
    "accordingly it has an equal dot product onto all the @xmath139 eigenstates , each of order @xmath195 .",
    "thus we may treat these dot products as constants in the sum .",
    "we may also replace the @xmath196 by the integral @xmath197 for a d - dimensional cluster of linear size @xmath198 .",
    "then @xmath187 simplifies to @xmath199 here @xmath200 and @xmath201 .",
    "we now consider the effect of the @xmath75 part of @xmath87 .",
    "for both clusters @xmath75 is concentrated at the outer boundary .",
    "it thus has significant fourier components at large @xmath139 .",
    "however , this charge concentration is in any case qualitatively weaker than the complete concentration found in @xmath50 .",
    "accordingly we expect the @xmath75 part of @xmath87 to have a minor effect and the scaling estimates for @xmath187 to hold for the full @xmath87 as for the @xmath50 .",
    "the foregoing estimates indicate a qualitative difference in @xmath187 in the two cases .",
    "this positive energy diverges with @xmath49 for the extended cluster but remains finite for the compact cluster .",
    "it disfavors the extended cluster .",
    "this contrasts with the equipotential part of @xmath4 , which favors extended clusters .",
    "this equipotential energy @xmath107 is of order @xmath209 for extended clusters and of order @xmath210 for compact clusters .",
    "the total energy @xmath211 thus favors compact clusters , in contrast to the  leading \" @xmath107 alone .",
