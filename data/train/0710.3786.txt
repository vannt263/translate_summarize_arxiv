    "recall that in figure [ filling](b ) , the slope @xmath5 corresponds to the rational tangle consisting of two short `` horizontal '' arcs in the filling ball @xmath233 .",

    "[ filling6](b ) ) . from figure  [ nk20](d )",
    "we see that @xmath238 is a link of three components @xmath323 , where @xmath324 is a trivial knot which bounds a disk @xmath325 disjoint from @xmath326 and which intersects @xmath230 in a single arc ; see figure  [ filling6](b ) .",
    "push the arc @xmath327 with its two endpoints fixed into @xmath328 along @xmath325 , and let @xmath329 be the resulting knot ( see part ( c ) of figure [ filling6 ] ) .",

    "* @xmath332 has a single arc component , and this arc component connects the two boundary components of @xmath250 and is outermost in @xmath330 amongst the components of @xmath333 .    among all disks in @xmath239 which satisfy conditions ( 1)(4 )",
    ", we may assume that @xmath330 has been chosen so that    * @xmath332 has the minimal number of components .",
    "[ parallel ] suppose that @xmath332 has circle components .",
    "then each such circle separates @xmath334 from @xmath335 in @xmath250 .",
    "let @xmath336 be a circle component of @xmath332 .",
    "then @xmath336 is essential in @xmath337 , for if it bounds a disk @xmath338 in @xmath337 , then an innermost component of @xmath339 will bound a disk @xmath340 .",
    "we can surger @xmath330 using @xmath341 to get a new disk satisfying conditions ( 1)(4 ) above , but with fewer components of intersection with @xmath250 than @xmath330 , contrary to assumption ( 5 ) .",
    "next since the arc component of @xmath332 connects the two boundary components of @xmath250 , @xmath336 can not separate the two boundary components of @xmath250 from each other .",
    "lastly suppose that @xmath336 separates the two points of @xmath342 .",
    "then @xmath336 is isotopic to a meridian curve of @xmath326 in @xmath239 .",
    "but this is impossible since @xmath336 also bounds a disk in @xmath330 and is therefore null - homologous in @xmath343 .",
    "the claim follows .",
    "it follows from claim [ parallel ] that there are disjoint arcs in @xmath250 , one , say @xmath344 , which connects the two points of @xmath345 and is disjoint from @xmath330 , and @xmath346 the other .",
    "hence we obtain a `` 2-bridge link '' of two components  one fat , one thin  in @xmath239 by capping off the `` @xmath52-braid '' in @xmath253 with @xmath344 and @xmath347 in @xmath348 and with @xmath349 and @xmath350 in the @xmath1-ball @xmath351 ( see figure [ filling7](a ) ) . furthermore , since the disk @xmath330 gives a disk bounded by the `` fat knot '' which is disjoint from the `` thin knot '' , the link is a trivial link .",
    "now it follows from the standard presentation of a @xmath37-bridge link as a @xmath52-plat ( see  12.b of @xcite ) , that there is an isotopy of @xmath253 , fixed on the ends @xmath352 and on the two fat strands , taking the `` 4-braid '' to one of the form shown in figure  [ filling7](b ) .",
    "hence @xmath227 has the form shown in figure  [ filling8](a ) .",
    "the filling rational tangle @xmath353 is of the form shown in figure  [ filling8](b ) .",
    "since the component @xmath354 of @xmath355 has to be a trefoil , there are only two possibilities for the number of twists in @xmath260 ; see figure [ filling8b ] .",
    "the two corresponding possibilities for @xmath264 are shown in figure  [ filling9 ] .",
    "but these are montesinos links of the form @xmath356 and @xmath357 , respectively .",
    "this final contradiction completes the proof of theorem  [ rf ] under the assumptions of case ( a ) of lemma [ gluing ] .",
    "in this case we choose an involution @xmath192 on @xmath136 as shown in figure [ inv3 ] .",
    "then @xmath358 , @xmath359 ( @xmath360 ) , and the restriction of @xmath192 on @xmath138 extends to an involution of @xmath137 whose fixed point set is a core circle of this solid torus .",
    "thus we obtain an involution @xmath192 on @xmath99 .",
    "the quotient of @xmath137 by @xmath192 is a solid torus @xmath361 whose core circle is the branch set .",
    "further , @xmath362 is a longitudinal annulus of @xmath361 .",
    "the quotient of @xmath136 by @xmath192 is also solid torus @xmath363 in which @xmath364 is a longitudinal annulus .",
    "figure [ inv3 ] depicts @xmath363 and its branch set .",
    "it follows that the pair @xmath365 is identical to the analogous pair in section  [ case a ] ( see figure  [ quo1 ] ) .",
    "next we take @xmath198 to be the same involution on @xmath100 as that used in section  [ case a ] .",
    "an argument similar to the one used in that section shows that @xmath192 and @xmath198 can be pieced together to form an involution @xmath215 on @xmath0 . from the previous paragraph",
    "we see that the quotient @xmath366 and its branch set are the same as those in section  [ case a ] .",

    "<S> it follows from proposition 7.6 of @xcite that if @xmath80 , the characters of @xmath81 and @xmath82 lie on @xmath58 and provide jumps in the multiplicity of zero of @xmath85 over @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> lemma 4.1 of @xcite then implies that both @xmath87 and @xmath88 are non - trivial . by the previous lemma , @xmath3 is a slope of type @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath87 has order @xmath37 . since @xmath89 and @xmath82 factors through @xmath81 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath88 also has order 2 .    </S>",
    "<S> next we claim that @xmath69 lies in the kernel of the composition of @xmath82 with the abelianisation @xmath90 . to see this , note first that @xmath5 is non - zero in @xmath91 since @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> thus exactly one of @xmath69 and @xmath93 is zero in @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> ( recall that duality implies that the image of @xmath95 in @xmath94 is @xmath96 . ) </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath5 lies in the kernel of @xmath82 , it follows that @xmath88 is sent to zero in @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> but then @xmath88 has order @xmath1 in @xmath83 , contrary to what we deduced in the previous paragraph . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> now apply the argument at the end of the proof of proposition 6.6 of @xcite to see that @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> hence @xmath51 has four boundary components .    </S>",
    "<S> the four - punctured @xmath37-sphere @xmath51 cuts @xmath0 into two components @xmath99 and @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath101 denotes the copy of @xmath51 in @xmath102 then @xmath0 is the union of @xmath99 and @xmath100 with @xmath103 and @xmath104 identified by a homeomorphism @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> the boundary of @xmath51 cuts @xmath6 into four annuli @xmath106 listed in the order they appear around @xmath6 , where @xmath107 are contained in @xmath99 and @xmath108 are contained in @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> the arguments given in the proof of lemma 4.5 of @xcite show that for each @xmath109 , the two annuli @xmath110 and @xmath111 in @xmath112 are unknotted and unlinked . </S>",
    "<S> this means that there is a neighbourhood of @xmath113 in @xmath112 which is homeomorphic to @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is a thrice - punctured @xmath37-sphere and @xmath116 is the interval @xmath117 $ ] , such that @xmath118 , and the exterior of @xmath114 in @xmath112 is a solid torus @xmath119 . </S>",
    "<S> we label the boundary components of @xmath115 as @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) so that @xmath122 for @xmath123 .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath124 be the two sphere in @xmath12 obtained from @xmath51 by capping off @xmath125 with four meridian disks from the filling solid torus @xmath126 . </S>",
    "<S> these disks cut @xmath126 into four @xmath37-handles @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) such that the attaching annulus of @xmath127 is @xmath129 for each @xmath130 . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath131 be the manifold obtained by attaching @xmath127 to @xmath112 along @xmath129 ( @xmath123 ) . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath132 is a once - punctured @xmath133 and @xmath134 a once - punctured @xmath135 .    </S>",
    "<S> it follows from the description above that @xmath99 is obtained from @xmath136 and @xmath137 by identifying @xmath138 with an annulus @xmath139 in @xmath140 whose core curve is a @xmath141 curve in @xmath140 . </S>",
    "<S> we can assume that @xmath139 is invariant under the standard involution of @xmath137 whose fixed point set is a pair of arcs contained in disjoint meridian disks of @xmath137 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the two boundary components of @xmath139 are interchanged under this map . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , @xmath100 is obtained from @xmath142 and @xmath143 by identifying @xmath144 with an annulus @xmath145 in @xmath146 whose core curve is a @xmath147 curve in @xmath146 . </S>",
    "<S> again we can suppose that @xmath145 is invariant under the standard involution of @xmath143 which interchanges the two boundary components of @xmath145 . </S>",
    "<S> see figures [ inv1 ] and [ inv2 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the map @xmath148 is constrained in several ways by our hypotheses . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the fact that @xmath6 is connected implies that @xmath149 for some @xmath150 . </S>",
    "<S> other conditions are imposed by the homology of @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> [ gluing ] we can assume that either + @xmath151 @xmath152 , and @xmath153 , or + @xmath154 @xmath155 and @xmath156 .    without loss of generality </S>",
    "<S> we can suppose that @xmath157 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , as @xmath6 is connected , one of the following four possibilities arises :    * @xmath158 and @xmath153 . </S>",
    "<S> * @xmath159 and @xmath156 . * @xmath160 and @xmath161 , or * @xmath162 and @xmath153 .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath163 be represented , respectively , by @xmath164 , @xmath165 , and a core of @xmath119 , @xmath166 . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath167 is the abelian group generated by @xmath168 , subject to the relation @xmath169 since @xmath170 , we may orient @xmath171 , @xmath172 so that in @xmath173 we have @xmath174 . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath173 is the quotient of @xmath175 by this relation together with the additional relations corresponding to the four possible gluings :    * @xmath176 , @xmath177 * @xmath178 , @xmath179 * @xmath180 , @xmath176 * @xmath181 , @xmath177    taking @xmath182 coefficients , equation ( i ) allows us to eliminate @xmath183 , while ( ii ) gives @xmath184 . </S>",
    "<S> hence @xmath185 , where the @xmath182 summand is generated by @xmath186 and @xmath187 is defined by generators @xmath188 , and relations @xmath184 plus those listed in ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) above . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath189 in cases  ( a ) and ( b ) , and @xmath190 in cases  ( c ) and ( d ) . </S>",
