    "attractive nearest neighbour interactions are commonly introduced in electronic lattice models in order to study ( unconventional ) superconductivity .",
    "however , an attractive non - local interaction can also cause a very different phenomenon in the electronic system ; in particular , it can generate charge instabilities .",
    "in this paper we focus on the tendency towards charge instabilities in two - dimensional ( 2d ) electronic systems which are simultaneously characterised by electronic correlations . through their correlations",
    "the electrons constitute a fermi liquid , with non - zero landau parameters and enhanced effective mass .",
    "the fermi liquid behaviour is expected to break down , especially if the correlations are strong close to half filling or when the attractive nearest neighbour interaction dominates .",
    "it is quite conceivable that the on - site interaction of electrons is repulsive whereas the nearest neighbour interaction becomes attractive .",
    "typically , the on - site coulomb interaction at transition - metal ions is strongly screened by the polarisation of neighbouring atoms , e.g. , oxygen ions in cuprates  @xcite .",
    "yet the screening depends on the local excitations of a cluster of atoms  for example , on the virtual excitations related to charge transfer in cuo@xmath5-octahedra  and can be different for nearest neighbour coulomb interaction as compared to the local screening or the lindhard - type screening for longer distances .",
    "coupling to other degrees of freedom  @xcite , such as a strong electron - lattice coupling , may in combination with screening produce an attractive nearest neighbour interaction , as in certain iron - pnictides  @xcite .    in recent years",

    "electronic correlation effects have been observed in scanning tunnelling spectroscopy  @xcite , and the electron system was characterised as a 2d electron liquid .",
    "moreover , the compressibility , which is manifestly related to the landau fermi - liquid parameter @xmath0 , was experimentally observed to be negative in a regime of low charge carrier density  @xcite  the latter being tuned by a backgate bias .    for the hubbard model",

    "the hubbard model extended by intersite coulomb interaction and electron - phonon coupling was shown , within a krsb evaluation , to produce inhomogeneous polaronic states  @xcite , a scenario which may well be realised in some heterostructures . in the present paper",

    "thereby we separated the correlation induced enhancement of @xmath91 at half filling from dos controlled effects .",
    "we found a strong enhancement of @xmath96 close to half filling for @xmath127 , and that mass renormalisation diverges at half filling  in agreement with the standard approaches to the hubbard model with strong on - site repulsion @xmath4 .",

    "it is zero only for particular values of filling @xmath71 , in the case that repulsive @xmath4 and attractive @xmath3 compete .",
    "higher landau parameters may then account for the residual interaction between quasiparticles but this has not yet been investigated .    for weak",
    "repulsive on - site interaction @xmath129 , the density dependence of @xmath91 is dominated by the strong dependence on the vhs which produce peaks of the dos for distinct fillings . if @xmath130 is larger than approximately a tenth of @xmath4 , the landau parameter @xmath91 attains negative values in the full range of densities .",
    "if @xmath131 is increased further , @xmath91 becomes less than @xmath108 , primarily close to the densities where the vhs dominate , and a charge instability emerges .",
    "however , for intermediate to large values of @xmath106 and @xmath125 , the charge instability is suppressed close to half filling . in fact , for increasing electronic correlations , we observe the formation of a pronounced peak of @xmath91 around half filling .",
    "this rounded peak with positive values is the very signature of strong correlations and is entirely absent for weak coupling ( @xmath132 ) . the tendency towards charge instability for negative @xmath3",
    "is quenched by electronic correlations in this regime ",
    "below half filling it may reemerge .",
    "finally , we would like to point to the observation that the effective interaction @xmath91 may still be sizable for low densities , both for dominating repulsive @xmath4 or for attractive @xmath3 .",
    "this is a hallmark of 2d electronic systems , as in contrast @xmath91 vanishes in the low density limit for generic 3d lattices , such as the cubic one @xcite .",
    "this is found both in our formalism and in perturbation theory . in that respect ,",
    "it is interesting to note that some 2d electronic systems have non - negligible interaction effects even for low electron fillings which are not necessarily related to the presence of long - range coulomb interactions .",
    "specifically , the electron system at interfaces of laalo@xmath133 films on srtio@xmath133 substrates was interpreted as an electron liquid rather than an electron gas ( see ref .",
    "moreover the metallic state , which is formed on srtio@xmath133 surfaces appears to support electronic correlations , unexpected for such a low density electron system ( see ref .",

    "<S> attractive non - local interactions jointly with repulsive local interaction in a microscopic modelling of electronic fermi liquids generate a competition between an enhancement of the static charge susceptibility  ultimately signalling charge instability and phase separation  and its correlation induced suppression . </S>",
    "<S> we analyse this scenario through the investigation of the extended hubbard model on a two - dimensional square lattice , using the spin rotation invariant slave - boson representation of kotliar and ruckenstein . </S>",
    "<S> the quasiparticle density of states , the renormalised effective mass and the landau parameter @xmath0 are presented , whereby the positivity of @xmath1 constitutes a criterion for stability . </S>",
    "<S> van hove singularities in the density of states support possible charge instabilities . a ( negative ) next - nearest neighbour hopping parameter @xmath2 shifts their positions and produces a tendency towards charge instability even for low filling whereas the @xmath2-controlled particle - hole asymmetry of the correlation driven effective mass is small . </S>",
    "<S> a region of instability on account of the attractive interaction @xmath3 is identified , either at half filling in the absence of strong electronic correlations or , in the case of large on - site interaction @xmath4 , at densities far from half filling . </S>"
