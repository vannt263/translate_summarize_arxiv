    "in the early seventies f black and m scholes @xcite and , independently , r merton @xcite introduced a mathematical model for the pricing of european options .",
    "the black - scholes - merton ( bs ) model is described by an @xmath1 evolution equation .",
    "the mathematical expression of the bs equation is @xmath2 in which @xmath3 is time , @xmath4 is the current value of the underlying asset , for example a stock price , @xmath5 is the rate of return on a safe investment , such as government bonds and @xmath6 is the value of the option .",
    "the solution of ( [ bs.01 ] is subject to the satisfaction of the terminal condition @xmath7 , when @xmath8 .    for the prices of commodities ,",
    "e schwartz @xcite proposed three models which study the stochastic behaviour of the prices of commodities that take into account several aspects of possible influence on the prices .  in the simplest model he assumed that the logarithm of the spot price followed a mean - reversion process of ornstein - uhlenbeck type .",
    "this is termed the one - factor model .",
    "the one - factor model is described by the equation @xmath9where @xmath10 measures the degree of reversion to the long - run mean log price , @xmath11 is the market price of risk , @xmath12 is the drift rate of @xmath4 and @xmath13 is the current value of the futures contract .",
    "the solution of ( [ bs.02 ] ) satisfies the initial condition @xmath14    the bs equation ( [ bs.01 ] ) and the one - factor equation ( [ bs.02 ] ) are of the same equivalence class as the schrdinger equation and the heat diffusion equation .",
    "all four equations model random phenomena of different contexts .",
    "the two first are in financial mathematics , the third in quantum physics and the fourth in dispersion .",
    "it has been proven that all four equations are maximally symmetric and invariant under the same group of invariant transformations of dimension @xmath15 which span the lie algebra @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a representation of the three - dimensional weyl ",
    "heisenberg group , ( in the mubarakzyanov classification scheme morozov58a , mubarakzyanov63a , mubarakzyanov63b , mubarakzyanov63c this is @xmath18 ) .",
    "this means that there exists a point transformation which transforms one equation to another .",
    "the lie symmetries of the bs equation ( [ bs.01 ] ) have been found in @xcite , whereas the lie symmetries of the one - factor model ( bs.02 ) were found in @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the models ( [ bs.01 ] ) and ( [ bs.02 ] ) ) are generally assumed to be constant . however ,",
    "in real problems they may vary with time if the time - span of the model is sufficiently long .",
    "in @xcite it has been shown that , when the parameters @xmath19 , and @xmath5 of the bs equation are time - dependent , _ ie _ , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the time - dependent bs equation is invariant under the same group of invariant transformations as that of the `` static '' bs equation .",
    "the same result has been found for the time - dependent one - factor model of commodities @xcite . hence the autonomous and the nonautonomous equations ( [ bs.01 ] ) and ( [ bs.02 ] )",
    "are maximally symmetric and equivalent under point transformations . in classical mechanics the slowly lengthening pendulum with equation of motion in the linear approximation,@xmath22",
    "in which the time dependence in the ` spring constant ' is due to the length of the pendulum s string increasing slowly @xcite , admits the conservation law @xcite ( note that the case of a slowly shortening pendulum is quite different @xcite)@xmath23where @xmath24 , is a solution of the second - order differential equation@xmath25 this result is independent of the rate of change of the length of the pendulum .",
    "the latter equation is the well - known ermakov - pinney equation @xcite .",
    "the solution was given by pinney in @xcite and it is @xmath26subject to a constraint on the three constants , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "functions @xmath30 are two linearly independent solutions of ( [ bs.03 ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ bs.03 ] ) is invariant under the action of the group invariant transformations in which the generators of the infinitesimal transformations form the @xmath31 algebra .",
    "this is the lie algebra admitted by the harmonic oscillator , @xmath32 , and the equation of the free particle ,  @xmath33 lut , leach1980,leacha08 .",
    "the transformation which connects the nonautonomous linear equation ( [ bs.03 ] ) with the autonomous oscillator is a time - dependent linear canonical transformation of the form @xmath34where @xmath35 is given by ( [ bs.06 ] ) .",
    "the connection of the number of symmetries of the corresponding schr\"odinger equation with the noether point symmetries of the classical lagrangian @xcite was seen to extend to the time - dependent case @xcite and , indeed , be seen to be the same as the equivalent autonomous systems @xcite and in the case of maximal symmetry is @xmath36 which is that of the @xmath37 classical heat equation .    in this context",
    "we wish to see what happens when we pass from an autonomous @xmath0 evolution equation to the corresponding nonautonomous case .",
    "for that we study the lie symmetries of the nonautonomous models  of : ( a ) the two - factor model of commodities and ( b ) the two - dimensional bs equation .",
    "we find that , for the two - factor model , the autonomous and the nonautonomous equations are invariant under the same group of invariant transformations @xmath38 .",
    "however , that it is not true for the two - dimensional bs equation .",
    "the reason for that is that the lie symmetries of the two - factor model follow from the translation group of the two - dimensional euclidian space ( except the homogeneous and the infinite number of solution symmetries ) .",
    "the translation group generates lie symmetries for both the autonomous system and for the nonautonomous system .    on the other hand",
    "the autonomous two - dimensional bs equation is maximally symmetric , _ ie _ , it admits nine lie symmetries plus the infinite number of solution symmetries , which form the @xmath39lie algebra.@xmath40this result completes the analysis of consta in which they found that the two - dimensional  bs equation admits seven lie point symmetries plus the @xmath41 .",
    "the nonautonomous two - dimensional bs equation is invariant under the lie algebra @xmath42 , that is , the @xmath43 subalgebra is lost .",
    "the reason for that is that the lie symmetries of the autonomous two - dimensional bs equation arise from the homothetic algebra of the two - dimensional euclidian space which defines the laplace operator of the evolution equation and , when the parameters in the second derivatives are not constants , the homothetic algebra of the euclidian space does not generate lie symmetries .",
    "moreover , in the case for which the parameters of the second derivatives are time - indepedent , the two - dimensional bs equation is maximally symmetric , _ ie _ , it is invariant under the same group of point transformations as the ( 1 + 2 ) autonomous bs and heat conduction equations .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section [ twofactor ]",
    "we study the lie symmetries of the two - factor model of commodities for the autonomous and nonautonomous cases .",
    "we show that in both cases the two - factor model is invariant under the @xmath44 lie algebra .",
    "the lie symmetries of the two - dimensional bs equation , the autonomous and the nonautonomous , are studied in section [ 2dbs ] . finally in section",
    "[ con ] we give some applications and we draw our conclusions .",
    "the two - factor model adds to the spot price , @xmath4 , of ( [ bs.02 ] ) the instantaneous convenience yield , @xmath45 , which may be interpreted as the flow of services accruing to the holder of the spot commodity but not to the owner of a futures contract .",
    "the evolution partial differential equation for this model is @xmath46for which the terminal condition is now @xmath47    equation ( [ bs.08 ] ) is an @xmath0 evolution equation and under the coordinate transformation@xmath48becomes@xmath49 in which the new parameters are expressed on the terms of the old ones according to @xmath50@xmath51and@xmath52    the lie symmetries for the autonomous two - factor model ( [ bs.08 ] ) have been reported in @xcite .",
    "however , for the convenience of the reader we present the results .",
    "consider the infinitesimal one - parameter point transformation @xmath53where @xmath54 is an infinitesimal number so that @xmath55 . from the transformation",
    "we define the generator @xmath56 , as @xmath57or , equivalently , @xmath58    the differential equation , @xmath59([bs.10 ] ) , is invariant under the action of the one - parameter point transformation ( [ bs.14])-([bs.15 ] ) if there exists a function @xmath60 such that @xcite@xmath61 } \\theta = \\lambda \\theta   \\label{bs.18}\\]]in which @xmath62 } $ ] is the second prologation of @xmath56 defined in the space @xmath63 .",
    "when condition ( [ bs.18 ] ) holds , we say that @xmath56 is a lie ( point ) symmetry of @xmath64    therefore from ( [ bs.18 ] ) we have the following lie symmetries admitted by equation ( [ bs.10 ] ) @xmath65@xmath66@xmath67@xmath68and @xmath69the parameters @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are functions of @xmath74  and @xmath75 . @xmath76the lie symmetries form the @xmath77 lie algebra .",
    "we note that for special cases of the parameters @xmath78 , the representation of the admitted lie symmetries of equation ( [ bs.10 ] ) can be different .  for instance , when all the parameters @xmath79vanish , @xmath80 , the lie symmetries @xmath81 become@xmath82@xmath83and @xmath84for the remaining cases see @xcite",
