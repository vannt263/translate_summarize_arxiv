    "it is classically known that there is a rich interplay between @xmath4-manifold theory and the topology of isolated singularities in complex surfaces .",
    "this goes back to the work of f. klein by the end of the 19th century , and then made clearer by in the early 1960s , by the work of grauert @xcite and mumford @xcite .",
    "a closed oriented @xmath4-manifold @xmath5 is the link of some isolated complex surface singularity @xmath6 if and only if @xmath5 is a waldhausen manifold ( a @xmath4-manifold which is obtained by gluing some seifert manifolds along tori ) with negative definite intersection form .",
    "this important theorem has played , on one hand , a key role for understanding the topology of surface singularities through the work of w. neumann and many others . on the other hand ,",
    "the links of isolated surface singularities provide a very interesting class of @xmath4-manifolds which , thanks to their rich algebraic nature , have proved to be rather useful for @xmath4-manifold theory , as for instance for the understanding of the casson invariant , seiberg - witten invariants , floer homology and other important invariants of @xmath4-manifolds that have been discovered in the last decades .    in this sense , it is interesting to find new classes of @xmath4-manifolds , besides the links of isolated complex surface singularities , that have a rich ( possibly algebraic ) geometric structure .",
    "one has the theorem of a. nemethi , a. szilard , f. michel and a. pichon , stating that if @xmath0 is a holomorphic function - germ @xmath7 with a @xmath8-dimensional critical set , then the boundary of the milnor fiber is a waldhausen manifold .",
    "the theorem was announced first by f. michel and a. pichon @xcite , but its proof contained a gap . in  @xcite f. michel , a. pichon and c. weber provided a proof valid for some classes of non - isolated singularities .",
    "the first complete proof of the general ( reduced holomorphic ) case of the theorem was provided by a. nemethi and a. szilard in @xcite , where even an algorithm to compute the graph describing the waldhausen manifold is given . shortly afterwards",
    "f. michel and a. pichon have provided in @xcite another complete proof which is more in the spirit of the original method they proposed . in this paper",
    "we envisage a similar problem , although in a more general approach .",
    "let @xmath9 be a @xmath4-dimensional isolated singularity complex analytic germ at the origin .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be holomorphic function - germs defined in @xmath9 .",
    "we say that the real analytic map - germ @xmath10 has a milnor fibration if there exist small positive real numbers @xmath11 and @xmath12 with @xmath13 such that the restriction @xmath14 is the projection of a locally trivial fibration , where @xmath15 is the polydisk in the ambient space @xmath16 defined by @xmath17 @xmath18 is the closed ball around @xmath3 in @xmath19 with radius @xmath12 and @xmath20 .",
    "a. pichon and j. seade proved in @xcite that if @xmath0 and @xmath1 are holomorphic function - germs defined on a holomorphic germ of surface @xmath21 with no common irreducible components and if the real analytic map - germ @xmath22 has an isolated critical value , then @xmath2 has the thom @xmath23 condition and therefore it has a milnor fibration in the tube .",
    "they also conjectured that this was true in higher dimensions and latter they gave a proof to this conjecture in @xcite , which turned out to be false , as pointed by a. parusinski with a counter - example ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our main theorem is :    [ theo_main ] let @xmath9 be a @xmath4-dimensional isolated singularity complex analytic germ at the origin .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be holomorphic function - germs ( not necessarily reduced ) defined in @xmath9 such that @xmath24 and @xmath25 have no common irreducible components and such that the real analytic map - germ @xmath10 has an isolated critical value .",
    "let @xmath26 denote the singular set of the surface @xmath27 , considered with reduced structure . then :    * for each irreducible component @xmath28 of the intersection @xmath29 , let @xmath30 be a generic transversal section , with @xmath31",
    ". then @xmath2 has a milnor fibration in the tube if and only if the restriction of @xmath2 to each @xmath32 has isolated critical values ( which is equivalent to an easy to check numerical criterion at the level of the embedded resolution of the restriction of @xmath33 to @xmath32 , as showed in @xcite ) . * in this case , the boundary of the milnor fibre @xmath34 , for @xmath35 , is a waldhausen manifold .    in @xmath36 of the theorem above we give necessary and sufficient conditions for @xmath2 defined in higher dimensions to have a milnor fibration in the tube .",
    "we prove this in section [ section_3 ] .",
    "the proof of @xmath37 of theorem [ theo_main ] provides a shorter proof of the theorem of michel - pichon - weber and nemethi - szilard ( for the reduced holomorphic case ) and generalizes to real analytic map - germs of the form @xmath2 , even when either @xmath0 or @xmath1 is not reduced .",
    "the main new technique is a careful study of the vertical monodromies associated to the irreducible components of the singular set , by means of a careful dissection of the transversal milnor fibre . the proof is based in a detailed understanding of the milnor fibre of a map - germ of the form @xmath2 defined in the complex plane , in terms of an embedded resolution of @xmath38 .",
    "precisely , in section [ section_2 ] we carefully dissect the milnor fibre of a map - germ @xmath10 ( defined on a complex analytic germ of surface ) into simple pieces , guided by the structure of an embedded resolution of the complex curve @xmath33 , in such a way that each piece is either a finite disjoint union of cylinders or a finite covering over a multi - punctured disk .",
    "then in section [ section_4 ] we proceed to the @xmath4-dimensional case by means of a slicing argument .",
    "we first split the boundary of the milnor fibre of @xmath39 into two parts : one part that is inside a tubular neighbourhood of the link of the critical set of @xmath2 in the milnor polydisc ( called the vanishing zone ) , and other part that is away of this neighbourhood .",
    "we first show that this second part of the milnor fibre is a waldhausen manifold , and since these two parts glue together along a finite union of tori , it just remains to show that the part of the milnor fibre of @xmath2 which lies inside the vanishing zone is a waldhausen manifold .",
    "we do so by means of a slicing argument : we describe it as a fibre bundle over a circle whose fibre is the milnor fibre of the restriction of @xmath2 to a hyperplane section of @xmath21 , with the decomposition given in section [ section_2 ] , and whose monodromy respects such decomposition .",
    "the description of the milnor fibre of a germ of the form @xmath2 defined in a complex surface @xmath40 ( section [ section_2 ] ) also allows us to generalize ( for real analytic map - germs of the type @xmath2 defined in a complex surface ) the acampo formula for computing the zeta - function of the monodromy , in terms of an embedded resolution of singularities .",
    "this is theorem  [ funczeta ] of section [ section_5 ] .",
    "a natural next step would be to give an algorithm to determine the graph associated to the boundary of the milnor fibre of functions @xmath41 generalizing the algorithm of  @xcite to this kind of real analytic germs .",
