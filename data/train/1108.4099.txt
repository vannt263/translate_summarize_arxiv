    "@xcite extended these results for unbounded perturbations ( possibly random ) using analytic machinery of stieltjes transform .",
    "it is to be noted that this result on the sum does not yield asymptotic freeness between the matrices .",
    "the special case where @xmath67 has finite rank has received considerable amount of interest recently . in this case , the limit measure is still the semi - circular law but the behavior at the edge has some interesting properties . see @xcite .",
    "one relevant question is whether this asymptotic freeness persists for some other types of matrices .",
    "consider the class of _ patterned matrices_. these are matrices where , along with symmetry , some other assumptions are imposed on the structure .",
    "important examples are the toeplitz , hankel , symmetric circulant and reverse circulant .",
    "the spectrum of these matrices were studied in @xcite . generally speaking the stieltjes transform",
    "does not seem to be a convenient tool to study these matrices due to the strong dependence among the rows and columns .",
    "@xcite showed that under suitable assumptions on the pattern , there is joint convergence of i.i.d .",
    "copies of a _ single _ pattern matrix as dimension goes to infinity .",
    "one important consequence is that in the limit other kinds of non - free independence may arise .",
    "in particular , symmetric circulants are commutative and reverse circulants are asymptotically half independent .",
    "as yet , no description of independence is available for the toeplitz and hankel matrices . as a more general goal , we investigate the joint convergence of multiple independent copies of these matrices , including the wigner .",
    "inter alia , we address the asymptotic freeness of the wigner matrices and patterned matrices . in theorem  [ main theorem-1 ] , we provide sufficient conditions for joint convergence holds .",
    "we deal with only real symmetric matrices as the structure of many of these matrices change if one takes complex entries .",
    "one of the basic _ necessary _ assumptions on the pattern matrices is _ property b _ , which states that the maximum number of times any entry is repeated in a row",
    "remains uniformly bounded across all rows as @xmath69 .",
    "all the above five matrices satisfy property b. under property b and some moment assumptions on the entries we show that if a criteria ( condition  [ psi ] ) holds for one copy each of any subcollection of matrices , then the joint convergence holds for multiple copies .",
    "this condition  [ psi ] is satisfied by all the five matrices .",
    "we use the method of moments and the so called volume method to prove these results .",
    "see  @xcite for the use of volume method for convergence of spectral measure of patterned matrices . as an application of theorem  [ main theorem-1 ] ,",
    "the following holds : if @xmath54 is a symmetric polynomial in any of the two following scaled matrices : wigner , toeplitz , hankel , reverse circulant and symmetric circulant with uniformly bounded entries then the spectral measure @xmath40 of the matrix @xmath54 converges to a non - random measure @xmath41 on @xmath70 weakly almost surely .    in theorem [",
    "theorem : free1 ] , we show that any collection of wigner matrices is free of the other four matrices",
    ". as already discussed , wigner and deterministic matrices are asymptotically free . by the results of @xcite and @xcite the results are true for general deterministic matrices which converge jointly . to the best of our knowledge",
    "these results directly do not imply the freeness result theorem  [ theorem : free1 ] .",
    "this is because , the existing results need some conditions on the behavior of the trace of the matrices as pointed out in remark 3.6 of @xcite .",
    "the condition in @xcite ( equation ( 3.4 ) therein ) was studied in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that under the technical condition on the random matrices ( see condition @xmath71 and @xmath72 in @xcite ) there is asymptotic freeness between wigner and other random matrices .",
    "although the theorems of @xcite are for gue , it is expected that the results would be true for real entries or goe .",
    "in other available criteria for freeness , condition ( [ eq : cond : free ] ) appears ( see @xcite and theorem 22.2.4 of @xcite ) .",
    "this is not applicable in our situation as it is known from the works of @xcite that the spectral norm of toeplitz , hankel , reverse circulant and symmetric circulant are unbounded .    instead of attempting to check / modify the technical sufficient condition of @xcite we extend the volume method to derive theorem  [ theorem : free1 ] .",
    "this technique is similar in spirit to those in chapter 22 of @xcite .",
    "however , we bypass the detailed properties of permutation group and weingarten functions .",
    "it is quite feasible that the techniques of @xcite and @xcite may be extended to prove theorem  [ theorem : free1 ] .",
    "incidentally , if we take the wigner with complex entries then theorem  [ theorem : free1 ] holds for any patterned matrix satisfying property b and having an lsd .",
    "the use of random matrix theory and free probability in cdma ( code division multiple access ) and mimo ( multiple input and multiple output ) systems was shown in many articles .",
    "see @xcite . for a mimo system with @xmath73 transmitter antenna and @xmath74 receiver antenna ,",
    "the received signal is represented in terms of equation @xmath75 where @xmath76 is an @xmath73- dimensional vector depending on @xmath24 and @xmath77 is a noise signal and @xmath78 is the channel matrix which generally has a block structure as below and @xmath79 is an @xmath74 dimensional vector .",
    "@xmath80.\\ ] ] one of the main issues in the study of a mimo system is the eigenvalue distribution of @xmath81 since this is linked to the capacity of the channel . here",
    "@xmath82 can be wigner matrices or more general matrices .",
    "it may also happen that some of the blocks are toeplitz or hankel or any other structured matrices .",
    "studying the spectral properties of such matrices boils down to studying the joint convergence of different patterned matrices .",
    "the results of this article can be used for studying such systems .",
    "we refer the readers to the recent article by @xcite which applies similar results for mimo system .",
    "finally we point out that we could not obtain full characterization of the joint limits if one of the matrices is not wigner .",
    "it is known that in a complex unital algebra only two notions of independence of subalgebras may arise : freeness and classical independence ( see @xcite ) .",
    "although reverse circulant limit shows half independence , this notion is only for variables of an algebra and not for subalgebras ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for other matrices like toeplitz and hankel nothing is known yet about the joint convergence .",
    "in section  [ sec : def ] we recall definitions of pattern matrices and express the trace in terms of circuits and words ( equivalently pair - partitions ) . in section  [ main results ]",
    "we state our main results on joint convergence of patterned matrices including those mentioned earlier as well as theorem  [ theorem : catalan ] on the contribution of certain monomials depending on the structure of the matrices .",
    "we also discuss the properties of the sum of two random matrices in the limit .",
    "the final section  [ sec : proof ] is dedicated to the proofs .",
