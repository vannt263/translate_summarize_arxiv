    "if the manifold has second betti - number @xmath2 divisible by 4 and first betti - number @xmath14 the instanton moduli space consists of projectively flat connections and has expected dimension zero .",
    "this should be thought of as a ` casson - type ' moduli space because the holonomy yields a surjection onto the space of @xmath15 representations of @xmath16 with fixed stiefel - whitney class @xmath17 .",

    "after recalling the gauge - theoretical situation considered in @xcite we show that if the casson - type moduli space is non - empty , then we can not have a connected sum decomposition @xmath4 unless both @xmath5 and @xmath6 are divisible by four .",
