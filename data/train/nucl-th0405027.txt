    "the joint use of short - range dynamic correlations with model wave functions including relevant aspects of the nuclear structure constitutes the most commonly used scheme to describe nuclear bound states with realistic or semi realistic interactions .",
    "short range correlations are essential elements in the wave function because , as it is well known , any of the so - called realistic or semi - realistic parameterizations of the nuclear potential presents a strong short - range repulsive core . on the other hand , the formation of different kind of clusters in the nuclei can be understood as a collective movement of the nucleons governed by the medium and long range part of the nuclear potential .",
    "therefore , for an accurate description of the nuclear states , it is convenient to consider both aspects in any variational approach to the nuclear bound states using this type of interactions . in principle",
    ", short range correlations are mainly governed by the nucleon - nucleon interaction while medium and long range effects depend on the particular nuclear state . however , and in a more careful approach , the final form of the short range correlations will depend on the model wave function giving rise to a non negligible dependence of the correlations on the nucleus .    a direct way to include both short range and medium and long range correlations",
    "is by using jastrow type correlation factors , but the calculation of the expectation values becomes very cumbersome , especially when state dependent correlations are included .",
    "there exist several methods to evaluate these expectation values as those based on cluster expansions @xcite , the fermi - hipernetted - chain method @xcite or statistical methods such as the variational monte carlo @xcite .",
    "the coupled cluster method allows to incorporate both type of correlations @xcite . in this way it is possible to understand how the different correlation mechanisms are incorporated @xcite    alpha cluster models , or cluster models in general ,",
    "have been widely applied in microscopic descriptions of bound and scattering states of nuclear systems @xcite .",
    "variational wave functions built within this framework constitute an appropriate scheme for nuclei such as @xmath3be and @xmath4c , that present a clear cluster structure .",
    "the use of wave functions including the possibility of formation of alpha cluster structures or any other kind of grouping of nucleons improves the description of these nuclei and their neighbours with respect to simple mean field approximations @xcite .",
    "multi cluster models have been used in microscopic calculations , i.e. without effective cluster - cluster interactions , based on the generator coordinate method for some nuclei between a=12 and a=16 @xcite . in these works a volkov nucleon - nucleon potential was used @xcite .",
    "other results of microscopic multicluster calculations based on the stochastic variational method have been reported @xcite for some nuclei using the minnesota potential .",
    "neither of these potentials presents a strongly repulsive short range part and , therefore , short range correlations do not play a significant role . on the other hand , previous studies of alpha clustering based on nuclear potentials with a strongly repulsive core",
    "have been mainly restricted to spin - isospin saturated nuclei @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to study the ground state of some @xmath5-shell nuclei , @xmath6 , including clustering effects and short range and state dependent correlations , starting from @xmath2type nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "the nucleon clustering is described in terms of model wave functions based on a generalized margenau - brink model as in @xcite .",
    "short range correlations are included by means of a jastrow factor and the dependence on the spin and isospin exchange channels is included by using a linear state dependent correlation factor .",
    "angular momentum projection is carried out in order to obtain variational wave functions that are eigenfunctions of the total angular momentum operator .",
    "the calculations are performed by means of the variational monte carlo method .    here",
    "we extend a previous work @xcite to the @xmath6 case .",
    "this generalization is not straightforward because the angular momentum projection involves a spin mixing not present in spin and isospin saturated nuclei . in this paper",
    "we present an analytical reduction of the different expectation values for these nuclei , obtaining expressions suitable for the variational monte carlo method . by using this scheme , the computing time",
    "is hardly increased with respect to the spin - isospin saturated case .",
    "we apply the method to the ground state of @xmath7c , @xmath8c , @xmath8n , and @xmath9n .",
    "the results obtained are also valid for the mirror nuclei @xmath7n , @xmath8o and @xmath9o because the electrostatic energy has been not considered in the minimization process .",
    "a systematic analysis of the effects of the different correlations mechanisms included in the wave functions on the total energy and on the contribution of the different channels is carried out .",
    "one and two body densities are reported and the effect of the correlations are discussed .",
    "the scheme of this work is as follows . in section 2 the variational wave function and the analytical reduction of the expectation values leading to a form appropriate for the variational monte carlo method",
    "are detailed . in section 3",
    "we report and discuss the main results here obtained .",
    "the conclusions of the present work can be found in section 4 .",
    "the variational trial wave function used in this work is @xmath10    this structure has been used in previous studies of spin and isospin saturated nuclei @xcite .",
    "it consists of a central jastrow correlation factor @xmath11 , a linear correlation factor @xmath12 that can include state dependent correlations , and a model wave function @xmath13 that is antisymmetric and has the proper values of the total angular momentum and parity .",
    "the jastrow factor depends only on the distance between pair of nucleons @xmath14 the linear factor is defined as @xmath15 where the function @xmath16 depends on the radial and intrinsic degrees of freedom of particles , @xmath17 .",
    "this is the only part of the trial wave function where state dependent correlations are present explicitly .",
    "here we employ the same parameterization for the correlation functions @xmath16 and @xmath18 , used in previous works @xcite that has shown to provide good results @xmath19 where @xmath20 @xmath21    this operatorial dependence of the correlation factor is the same as that of the nucleon - nucleon interactions considered in this work .",
    "the functions @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath18 are parameterized as a linear combination of gaussians @xmath24    the new aspects of treating @xmath6 nuclei with respect to spin and isospin saturated ones are originated in the angular momentum projection .",
    "therefore we shall focus here on the model part of the wave function and on the angular momentum projection .",
    "the correlation factors are treated as in the spin and isospin saturated case .",
    "the model wave function used here is based on a generalization of the margenau - brink model .",
    "instead of using only alpha - particle like nucleon clusters , more general groupings are allowed giving rise to a multicluster description @xcite . within the molecular viewpoint of the margenau - brink scheme , the model wave function",
    "is obtained starting from the following functions @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a set of parameters that represent the centers of the clusters , and @xmath27 is the corresponding antisymmetrizer . in this work",

    "in this work the @xmath30 functions are taken to be slater determinants built from harmonic oscillator single particle orbitals centered at @xmath31 @xmath34    the oscillator parameter , @xmath35 , is the same for all of the alpha clusters .",
    "for the incomplete cluster wave function another slater determinant centered at @xmath33 is employed also built from @xmath36-wave harmonic oscillator single particle orbitals .",
    "the oscillator parameter in this case is , in general , different to that for the @xmath28 cluster wave function .",
    "the importance of using a different harmonic oscillator parameter will be discussed . with these choices for the cluster wave functions ,",
    "the model wave function of the @xmath37 nucleons is a slater determinant . in general",
    "this function is not eigenfunction of parity or total angular momentum operators .",
    "the following linear combinations @xmath38 have definite parity .",
    "model wave functions with the total angular momentum of the state under study can be obtained from eq .",

    "the quantum number @xmath43 gives the total angular momentum , @xmath44 is its projection along the nuclear @xmath45 axis and @xmath46 the projection along the @xmath47 axis of the laboratory fixed frame .",
    "the projection within this scheme is carried out by rotating the intrinsic state and integrating over all angles weighted by the rotation matrix .",
    "the function @xmath48 in eq .",
    "( [ cluspart ] ) is the generator function of the model wave functions .",
    "note that we have removed the parametric dependence of the model wave function on the position of the centers , @xmath49 , in order to simplify the notation .",
    "the distances between the clusters , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , are determined variationally .",
    "the action of the rotation operator on the generator function is now described in detail . as we have mentioned before ,",
    "this is the source of the new methodological aspects originated by the fact that the nuclear states are not spin and isospin saturated .",
    "we do not need to consider here the correlation factors because they are rotationally invariant .",
    "the generator function is a slater determinant .",
    "the action of the rotation operator on it leads to a linear combination of slater determinants .",
    "if the slater determinant is spin and isospin saturated this linear combination contains only one slater determinant that also is spin and isospin saturated , containing the same single - particle orbitals .",
    "the only difference is that , after rotation , these orbitals depend on the rotated coordinates .",
    "this was exploited previously to study @xmath52 nuclei @xcite .",
    "when the nuclei are not spin or isospin saturated the rotation gives rise to a mixing of spin states .",
    "when the incomplete shell consists of one nucleon , as for example in the ground state of @xmath7c , the action of the rotation operator can be written as follows @xmath53 where @xmath35 stands for the spatial quantum numbers of the orbital of the incomplete cluster , and @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the third component of spin and isospin , respectively .",
    "the over line indicates that the slater determinant must be evaluated on the rotated coordinates . therefore , and concerning to the spin dependence of the state ,",
    "the effect of the rotation is to mix the two possible spin projections of the orbital in the incomplete cluster .",
    "the weight of each component is given by the matrix element of the rotation matrix .",
    "when there are two extra nucleons the result of the rotation can be written as follows @xmath56 where ( @xmath57 ) and ( @xmath58 ) stand for the quantum numbers of the orbitals of the incomplete shell .",
    "note that we have considered the same spatial dependence for both single particle orbitals . therefore",
    ", if one is dealing with two extra protons ( @xmath8o ) or two extra neutrons ( @xmath8c ) with the two possible spin orientations the term @xmath59 vanishes . only in the case of one proton and one neutron outside closed shell ( @xmath8n ) both total spin components will contribute .    finally , the case of three nucleons outside closed shell ( @xmath9n and @xmath9o ) is a conjugate configuration to that of one nucleon outside closed shell and it is handled in the same way .",
    "the values allowed for @xmath43 and @xmath60 are governed by the symmetry group of the system .",
    "i.e. by the spatial positions of the centers of the clusters . for the nuclei here considered the group is c@xmath61 .",
    "the spin of the extra cluster must be also considered in determining the possible values of @xmath60 .",
    "if @xmath62 is the total spin third component the allowed @xmath60 values are given by the selection rule @xmath63 , with @xmath64 a positive integer @xcite , and , for any @xmath60 , @xmath65 and the parity is @xmath66 .",
    "the energy grows with @xmath60 , providing different rotational bands . in this work",
    "we are concerned only with the ground state , therefore we shall restrict ourselves to @xmath67 for @xmath8n and @xmath68 for all the rest . for one and three extra nucleons @xmath69 and the ground state is @xmath70 , and for two extra nucleons",
    "there are two possibilities ; i ) both nucleons are protons or neutrons @xmath71 and the state is @xmath72 , ii ) one nucleon is a proton and the other a neutron @xmath73 , and the @xmath74 ground state must be constructed with @xmath75 and @xmath67 .    in order to compute the expectation value of the hamiltonian in the projected wave function",
    "it is convenient to use the following expression @xcite latexmath:[\\[\\langle \\psi^{\\pm}_{jkm}|{\\bf h}|\\psi^{\\pm}_{jkm}\\rangle = \\frac{2j+1}{8\\pi^2 } \\int { \\mathcal d}^{j*}_{mk}(\\theta ) \\langle \\phi^{\\pm}_{\\vec{\\bf c}}| f_{\\mathcal",
    "l } f_{\\mathcal j}\\ , { \\bf h }   f_{\\mathcal j } f_{\\mathcal l}\\,{\\bf r}(\\theta )     let us focus on the spin - isospin configuration of the nuclear state .",
    "note that , because of the rotational invariance property of the hamiltonian , only the ket is rotated remaining the bra on its original configuration .",
    "this is important because it determines the configurations that gives non zero contribution to the integral when projected onto the bra .",
    "the action of the rotation operator is to produce a linear combination of configurations containing the original one .",
    "one needs to analyze all of them to determine if , after the action of the spin ",
    "isospin operators of @xmath12 and the hamiltonian , the original configuration is obtained . as a result , only the original configuration appearing after rotation contributes with both central and state dependent correlation factors , except except for incomplete clusters made of one proton and one neutron with @xmath77 , that we have not studied here , for which two of the configuration appearing after rotation give non zero contribution .",
    "note that the weight factor must be included when doing the integral in all of the cases .",
    "the treatment of state dependent correlations in terms of the intermediate states is not modified with respect to the case of spin and isospin saturated nuclei @xcite .",
    "first we will test the new methodological aspects implemented in this work by comparing with the results of dufour and descouvemont @xcite obtained by using a different computational scheme .",
    "we will employ for the test both the same nucleon - nucleon interaction ( the volkov v7 potential ) , and the same wave function as in @xcite .",
    "it is worth to point out that the correlation factor is not needed because the interaction does not present a strongly repulsive core .    in table",
    "[ table1 ] we show for the ground state and some excited states of the nuclei studied in this work the binding energy and the root mean square radius , @xmath78 . as can be seen from the table , both set of results",
    "are in a very good agreement .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction is not included in our work and therefore one can not compare directly the results for nuclei with an odd number of nucleons .",
    "for these nuclei we have compared with the average value of the states @xmath79 and @xmath80 of @xcite .",
    "this average gives a value that it is very close to the monte carlo result of this work , specially for @xmath7c where the spin - orbit splitting is smaller than in @xmath9n . from this test",
    "it can be concluded that , for @xmath6 , the angular momentum projection scheme of this work provide reliable results .",

[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     a more detailed analysis of the effect of the state dependent correlations on the energy can be done by looking at the contribution of the kinetic energy and of the different channels of the potential energy . in fig .",
    "2 we plot the differences between these quantities calculated with the jl and jlo wave functions for both the bb1 and the ms3 interactions . both the kinetic energy and the energy of the wigner channel rise with state dependent correlations for both potentials .",
    "this increase is more important for the kinetic energy with the ms3 potential than with the bb1 one , whereas the opposite holds for the energy of the wigner energy . for the bb1 potential ,",
    "the majorana channel is the responsible for the decrease in the ground state energy when state dependent correlations are considered . for the ms3 interaction , the effect on the majorana channel is practically canceled with that on the kinetic and wigner energies , and the bartlett and heisenberg channels make the nuclei more bounded .",

    "the first noticeable fact is that the general behaviour is different for the two interactions used here .",
    "thus at short distances state dependent correlations tend to increase the density with the bb1 interaction and the opposite happens with the ms3 potential , except for @xmath4c for which a negative region at short distances appears .",

    "the behaviour of this density is very similar for both potentials , although the effect of the nuclear core is much more important in the ms3 potential .",
    "the main difference is that with the ms3 interaction shorter distances are favoured with respect to the bb1 potential . at distances between 2 and 3.5 fm",
    "the differences among the nuclei considered are more important , with bigger values as the number of nucleons increases from @xmath4c to @xmath84o .",
