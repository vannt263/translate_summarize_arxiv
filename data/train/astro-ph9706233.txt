    "the exact nature of qso heavy  element absorption  line systems is not yet well understood .",
    "nevertheless , there is growing evidence suggesting that these absorbers are associated with galaxy halos and disks .",
    "deep images of fields around qsos with absorbers in their spectra have been made , and galaxies have been found at the redshifts and in the vicinities of absorbers ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the distances between galaxies and the associated absorbers are inferred to be of order 100 kpc , or the size of an extended galaxy halo ( @xcite ) .",
    "this association has also been inferred for a substantial fraction of the ly@xmath13 absorbers ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , but they are not the subject of this work .    one approach in relating absorbers to galaxies is to compare their respective clustering properties . in a previous paper , quashnock , vanden berk , & york ( 1996 , hereafter qvy ) analyzed line  of  sight correlations of  and  absorption  line systems on large scales , using an extensive catalog of 2200 heavy  element absorption  line systems in over 500 qso spectra ( @xcite ) .",
    "( more details about the catalog can be found in an earlier version of the catalog [ @xcite ] , as well as in qvy . )",
    "these authors found that the absorbers are clustered , like galaxies , on comoving scales of 50 to 100  ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "this high  redshift ( @xmath14 from 1.5 to 3.5 ) superclustering of the absorbers is on the same comoving scale as that traced by the voids and walls of galaxy redshift surveys of the local universe ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it thus appears that the absorbers are tracing the same structure as that traced by galaxies on very large scales , and that they are effective probes of very large scale structure in the universe ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the authors of qvy argued that this superclustering is generic ( they found potential superclusters along 7 different lines of sight ) ; indeed , such superclustering has been detected by many studies ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and refs . in qvy ) .    in this paper , we extend the qvy analysis of line  of  sight correlations of  and  absorption  line systems to smaller comoving scales",
    " from 1 to 16 , i.e. , galaxy cluster scales , corresponding to line  of sight velocity differences @xmath15 200  3000   at @xmath1  and relate the small  scale clustering of absorbers to galaxy clustering in general .",
    "early studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , with approximately 100  spectral resolution , found that  absorbers cluster significantly on these scales , with a correlation function @xmath16 5 to 10 for line  of  sight velocity differences @xmath17 200  600 . on smaller scales ( @xmath18 ) , internal motions of the gas comprising the absorption systems are expected to dominate ( heisler  1989 ) , if the absorbing gas is moving in gravitational orbits inside galactic halos with typical cloud velocity dispersions @xmath19 ( @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , petitjean & bergeron ( 1994 ) , using higher spectral resolution data , found that the  line  of  sight correlation function can be described by two gaussian components , with velocity widths @xmath20 109 and 525 , with the latter component accounting for almost all ( 93% ) of the signal in @xmath21 for @xmath17 200  600 .",
    "a similar result , with even higher resolution keck high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires ) spectra , has been found by rauch  ( 1996 ) .    a natural interpretation ( see , e.g. , sargent  1988 ) of these results is that the low  velocity component ( @xmath22 200 ) is due to gas motion inside the absorbers , with the higher  velocity component ( @xmath23 200 ) being due to actual spatial clustering of the absorbers on galaxy cluster scales ( several mpc ) .",
    "however , because the line  of  sight velocity dispersion of typical galaxy clusters ranges from 300  1400 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , the higher  velocity component may represent , at least in part , motion of absorbers inside a galaxy cluster , rather than true spatial clustering ( @xcite ) . this has been argued by crotts , burles , & tytler ( 1997 ) , who explore the spatial clustering of  systems along adjacent lines of sight , and claim that it is significantly weaker than clustering along a line of sight .",
    "we return to the question of interpretation of the clustering of heavy  element absorption lines in   6 .",
    "our interest here is in the _ form _ and _ evolution _ of that clustering on comoving scales of 1  and greater ( @xmath24 180 ) , corresponding to the higher  velocity component .",
    "we have taken steps (   3 ) to insure that there is no aliasing of power from the low  velocity component .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "we present our likelihood method of estimating the correlation function from the data in   2 .",
    "we describe our data selection criteria in   3 .",
    "we then discuss the _ form _ of the correlation function in   4 .",
    "we also present results on the _ evolution _ of the clustering , by calculating its redshift dependence in   5 .",
    "we discuss some of the implications of these results in   6 , and summarize them in   7 . in the appendix",
    ", we explicitly calculate the likelihood as a function of data and model parameters .",
    "here we outline our likelihood method of estimating the line  of  sight correlation function , @xmath25 .",
    "( we defer a detailed calculation of the likelihood function to the appendix . ) unless otherwise noted , we take @xmath6 and @xmath26 .",
    "we follow the usual convention and take the hubble constant to be 100@xmath27  km  s@xmath28  mpc@xmath28 .",
    "the correlation function @xmath25 relates the _ observed _ number of absorber pairs , separated by comoving distance @xmath0 at redshift @xmath14 , with the _ expected _ number of pairs , of the same separation and redshift , from an unclustered absorber population .",
    "the data @xmath29 consist of the observed set of absorber pairs @xmath30 , each with comoving separation @xmath31 at redshift @xmath32 .",
    "normally , in calculating the correlation function , these data are binned , and @xmath25 is obtained by dividing the observed number of pairs in a bin by the number expected in the bin . in our likelihood approach ,",
    "no such binning is necessary .",
    "consider a given model for @xmath25 .",
    "each such model is described by a set of parameters @xmath33 , and we wish to find the parameter values which best describe the observed data @xmath29 .",
    "to do so , we must maximize the _ likelihood _",
    "@xmath34 , ( calculated in the appendix , eq .  [ a4 ] ) , which is the probability of the data @xmath29 , given the model parameters @xmath33 for the correlation function @xmath25 : @xmath35 . given a prior distribution , @xmath36 , for the model parameters ( usually obtained from physical or symmetry arguments ) , we can use bayes theorem to then calculate the posterior probability distribution , @xmath37 , for the model parameters @xmath33 , given the data @xmath29 ( see @xcite for a compendium of astrophysical applications of bayesian inference ) : @xmath38    the parameter values which maximize the likelihood are those we take as the `` best  fit '' values , and credible regions for the parameters around the maximum  likelihood values are obtained from equation  ( 1 ) , by requiring that a fiducial amount of posterior probability ( such as 68.3% or 95.5% , nominal 1 and 2 @xmath39 amounts ) be contained inside the credible region .    in this paper",
    ", we consider three models for the correlation function .",
    "the first is a simple power law , with comoving clustering length @xmath40 and power  law index @xmath41 : @xmath42 the second is also a power law , but with an amplitude that evolves with decreasing redshift as a power of the expansion factor : @xmath43 again @xmath40 is the comoving clustering length ( at a fixed redshift @xmath44 ) , @xmath45 is the conventional evolutionary parameter ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and @xmath41 is a power ",
    "law index that does not evolve with redshift .",
    "the third model is that of a power  law correlation function evolving according to linear theory of gravitational instability ( @xcite , 1993 ) : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the growth factor .",
    "when @xmath48 and @xmath26 , @xmath49 .",
    "we have drawn our  and  data sample from the heterogeneous catalog of vanden berk  ( 1998 )  with the aim of constructing as homogeneous a dataset as possible  by accounting for the spectral wavelength coverage , spectral sensitivity , and spectral resolution of each line of sight .",
    "the selection criteria we used to produce the final set of absorption systems are similar to those in qvy , and we outine them here .    first , the ly@xmath13 forest region , where heavy  element line identifications are often unreliable , was excluded in each spectrum .",
    "the so  called associated region , within 5000  of each qso , was also excluded , because the origin of the systems in that region may be different than that of systems farther removed from the qso ( @xcite ) . only systems with at least a  or  doublet were selected ; in that case , the intrinsically stronger doublet component was required to have been detected at the @xmath50 or greater significance level .",
    "in addition , a system had to have at least one more identified heavy  element line , or have a doublet equivalent width ratio that is consistent with atomic physics ( within the measurement errors ) .",
    "since we are measuring correlations of absorber pairs with comoving separations of 1  or greater , we selected only those spectra or spectral regions in which the spatial resolution was better than this limit .",
    "all systems lying within 1  of each other , in the same line of sight , were combined into a single system by averaging the redshifts and taking the equivalent width of the strongest system .",
    "this has the effect of minimizing the aliasing of power from scales smaller than 1   corresponding to @xmath51  in the rest frame at @xmath1  where internal motions of the gas comprising the absorption systems are thought to dominate ( heisler  1989 ; and   1 above ) . since 180",
    "is 1.6 times as large as the low  velocity width ( @xcite , fig .",
    "4a ) , most of the clustering from the low  velocity gaussian component has been removed by our selection procedure .",
    "applying all the selection criteria above to the vanden berk  ( 1998 ) catalog leaves a data sample consisting of 260  absorbers , drawn from 202 lines of sight , with redshifts ranging from @xmath52 and mean redshift @xmath1 , and 64  absorbers , drawn from 278 lines of sight , with redshifts ranging from @xmath53 and mean redshift @xmath2 .",
    "figure  1 shows the line  of  sight correlation function @xmath54 , for the entire sample of  absorbers ( with mean redshift @xmath1 ) , as a function of absorber comoving separation @xmath0 from 1 to 16 , in 4 octaves .",
    "we have restricted our analysis to these scales , because data on scales larger than 16  is too scarce to be used unless it is put in very large bins , and because we did not want to examine scales smaller than 1 .",
    "the correlation function is computed by comparing the distribution of real absorber pair separations with the expected distribution for an unclustered sample .",
    "we calculated the expected distribution using monte carlo simulations , creating a large number of fake unclustered catalogs , using the following `` bootstrap '' method ( see qvy ) . for each monte carlo simulation ,",
    "the same number of absorption systems as in the real sample catalog was chosen for random distribution .",
    "the redshifts and equivalent widths of the random systems were kept the same as the real systems , as were the spectral properties of the observed qso lines of sight .",
    "the systems were then randomly placed along the lines of sight , subject to the condition that a system could have been detected in the given line of sight .",
    "this method randomizes the absorber placements , while taking into account the redshift and equivalent width number density , which remain exactly the same as in the real sample . the expected distribution of pair separations was then calculated by averaging the pair distribution over 1000 monte carlo simulations .",
    "the vertical error bars through the data points are 1 @xmath39 errors in the estimator for @xmath55 ( @xcite ) , and were computed in the same fashion as in qvy .",
    "the first point in figure  1 shows @xmath54 for @xmath0 between 1 and 2 , corresponding to 180  360  at @xmath1 .",
    "we find that @xmath56 , a value consistent with several previous determinations : ( 1 ) @xmath57 for @xmath17 200  600 ( sample a2 of sargent et al .",
    "1988 ) ; ( 2 ) @xmath58 at 360 ( fig . 3 of petitjean & bergeron 1994 ) ; and ( 3 ) @xmath59 at 300 ( fig . 4 of rauch  1996 ) .",
    "however , our dataset is large enough to measure @xmath55 on bigger scales and to determine the form of the correlation function more accurately .    from figure  1",
    ", the absorber line  of  sight correlation function on smaller scales can be described by a power law .",
    "however , some information has been lost because of the _ binning _ of data required to make the errors in figure  1 reasonably small .",
    "accordingly , a standard @xmath60-fit to the data is not the most powerful method available .",
    "instead , we have used the maximum  likelihood method of   2 ( eq . [ a4 ] ) to fit a power law of the form given in equation ( 2 ) to the _ unbinned _  data .",
    "we find maximum  likelihood values for the parameters , obtaining @xmath61  and @xmath62 .",
    "this fit is shown in figure  1 , and describes the data quite well .",
    "figure  2 shows the credible region for these parameters .",
    "the cross marks the maximum  likelihood location , and the heavy and light contours mark the 1 @xmath39 and 2 @xmath39 credible regions , respectively . in calculating the credible regions , we have used bayes theorem ( eq . [ 1 ] ) and taken uniform priors @xmath36 in the power law",
    "intercepts to figure 1 , corresponding , nor on its overall amplitude , @xmath55(1 ) = @xmath63 , we take uniform priors in @xmath64 and @xmath65(1 ) = @xmath66 ( the intercepts in fig .  1 ) .",
    "thus the prior probability density @xmath67 , or , using a jacobian to change to our two independent variables of interest , @xmath41 and @xmath40 , @xmath68 . ] to uniform priors @xmath36 in the parameters @xmath69 and @xmath41 .",
    "we condense the information in figure  2 by showing the marginalized posterior distributions for the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath40 in figures 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "the vertical lines mark the 1 @xmath39 credible regions , which we find to be @xmath70 , and 2.4  @xmath71 4.1  ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "thus , for the  sample as a whole , the absorber correlation function is well  fit by a power law of the form @xmath3 , with maximum  likelihood values of @xmath4 and comoving correlation length @xmath5  ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the  sample , with only 64 absorbers ( with mean redshift @xmath2 ) compared to 260 absorbers in the  sample , is not large enough to adequately model the form of the correlation function .",
    "the data are , at the 95% confidence level , consistent with all values of @xmath72 .",
    "nevertheless , the sample is large enough to constrain the comoving correlation length , if we fix the value of the power ",
    "law index at @xmath62 . in this case",
    ", we find that @xmath73 .",
    "this larger value  assuming that  clustering is directly comparable to that of  ( see   5 below )  suggests that the amplitude of the correlation function has grown between redshift @xmath1 and redshift @xmath2 . in the following section",
    ", we find that this is indeed the case , by investigating the evolution of the correlation function , using the _ entire _ sample of  and  absorbers .",
    "we have investigated the evolution of the clustering of absorbers by dividing the  absorber sample into three approximately equal redshift sub ",
    "samples , and comparing these to the  sample .",
    "figure  5 shows the mean of the correlation function , @xmath7 , averaged over comoving scales @xmath0 from 1 to 16 , for the low ( @xmath74 ) , medium ( @xmath75 ) , and high ( @xmath76 ) redshift  sub  samples , as well as for the  sample ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "the amplitude of the correlation function is clearly growing with decreasing redshift .",
    "we have used both the  and  samples to study the evolution of heavy  element absorber clustering with redshift , since these samples cover almost disjoint redshift intervals . for the following reasons",
    ", we believe that it is reasonable to do this .",
    "( 1 ) caulet ( 1989 ) , in a high  sensitivity survey of  and lines found in  systems , found that 60% to 70% of the population ( @xmath78 ) have moderate or strong  absorption lines ( equivalent width @xmath79  , like the bulk of our sample ) , the rest having either weak ( equivalent width @xmath80  ) or undetected lines .",
    "thus ,  systems can reasonably be expected to trace a similar clustering distribution as stronger  systems , and a correlation analysis should yield similar results , within the errors of @xmath7 in figure 5 .",
    "( in the absorption catalog [ @xcite ] , using loose selection criteria , we find that about 67% of the  systems have corresponding detected lines when they were accessible .",
    "however , after applying the stricter selection criteria (   3 ) used for the clustering analysis , only 7 /   systems remain .",
    "this is not sufficient to directly compare the clustering of each species . )",
    "( 2 ) the work of petitjean & bergeron ( 1990 , 1994 ) suggests that the clustering properties of  and  may be directly comparable .",
    "( 3 ) it seems highly unlikely that the distribution of  and systems would be different , in a statistical sense , on scales as large as those studied here , i.e. , 1  to 16 , corresponding to galaxy cluster and _ intercluster _ scales . that would imply a large  scale segregation of species .",
    "( 4 ) the correlation function measured for  systems is consistent with an extrapolation of the best  fit to the  data alone ( see below ) .",
    "we have used the maximum  likelihood formalism of   2 and the appendix to fit the _ unbinned _  and  data , and describe the evolution of the correlation function , using the evolving power law , given by equation ( 3 ) .",
    "we fix @xmath44 at the mean  redshift of 2.2 , so that the parameter @xmath40 corresponds to the correlation length at that redshift , enabling a direct comparison with the results of   3 for the  sample as a whole ( see below ) . since the data for the  sample , as well as for the  sample as a whole , are consistent with a constant value of the power  law index @xmath41 , and since growth of hierarchical clustering in gravitational instability theory ( @xcite , 1993 ) and in numerical simulations occurs with a nearly constant value of @xmath41 , we have fixed @xmath41 at its maximum  likelihood value of 1.75 in our analysis below , and parametrized the evolution of the correlation function in terms of the evolutionary parameter @xmath45 and the correlation length @xmath40 at redshift @xmath81 .",
    "figure  6 shows the credible region for these parameters .",
    "the heavy and light contours mark the 1 @xmath39 and 2 @xmath39 credible regions , respectively .",
    "the cross marks the maximum  likelihood location , which we find to be @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "this fit is the one shown as a solid line in figure  5 .    in order to check our assumption that  and",
    "clustering are directly comparable , we also show the maximum  likelihood fit to the  data alone ( shown as a dashed line in fig .",
    "5 ) , which we find to be @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the correlation function measured for  systems is clearly consistent with the value extrapolated from  at higher redshift .",
    "the error in the estimate of the evolutionary parameter @xmath45 is of course larger if we use the  data alone ( @xmath86 ) ; hence , we have included the  data in our analysis , for the reasons given above .",
    "we show the marginalized posterior distributions for the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath45 , in figures 7 and 8 , respectively .",
    "the vertical lines mark the 1 @xmath39 credible regions , which we find to be 2.6  @xmath87 3.8 , and @xmath88 .",
    "all these results are with @xmath6 . with @xmath89 , we expect our estimate of @xmath45 to decrease from 2.05 to 0.8 .",
    "it is interesting to compare the posterior distribution for @xmath40 in figures 4 and 7 .",
    "both have a maximum near the same location at @xmath90 , but the distribution in figure 7 is definitely narrower .",
    "this is not surprising , since the evolution in the amplitude of the correlation function ( and hence in the correlation length ) has smeared the distribution of @xmath40 in figure 4 .",
    "there , @xmath40 represents the correlation length for the  sample as a whole ( with mean redshift @xmath1 ) , whereas in figure 7 we have allowed for evolution , with @xmath40 representing the correlation length exactly at @xmath81 .",
    "the fact that the distribution in figure 7 is narrower is more evidence in favor of an evolving correlation function . with @xmath91 ,",
    "the no  evolution case ( @xmath92 ) is in fact _ ruled out _ at the 3.3 @xmath39 ( 99.95 % ) confidence level .",

    "it appears that the absorbers are tracing the large  scale structure seen in the distribution of galaxies and clusters , and are doing so at high redshift .",
    "the finding strengthens the case for using absorbers in probing large  scale structure .",

    "evidence for a trend of increasing clustering of ly@xmath13 absorbers [ with @xmath96 with decreasing redshift has been found by cristiani  ( 1997 ) . like crotts ( 1989 )",
    ", these authors also find a clear trend of increasing ly@xmath13 absorber clustering with increasing column density , and find that an extrapolation to column densities typical of heavy  element systems [ @xmath97 is consistent with the clustering observed for  absorbers ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our finding of growth in the clustering of heavy  element systems with decreasing redshift supports both a continuity scenario between ly@xmath13 and heavy  element systems ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the common action of gravitational instability .",
    "fernndez - soto  ( 1996 ) have investigated the correlation function of ly@xmath13 absorbers [ with @xmath98 at high redshift , by using corresponding  systems as tracers . after comparing the observed correlations at high redshift to the galaxy correlation length at present ( viz . , @xmath99 )",

    "4 of fernndez - soto  1996 ) , consistent with our finding .",
    "however , their determination , unlike ours , is dependent upon comparing absorber clustering in the past with galaxy clustering at present .",
    "this is problematic , since the exact relationship between the stronger ly@xmath13 absorbers , presumed to be halos of protogalaxies , and the corresponding population of galaxies today is unknown , and different types of galaxies are known to cluster with differing strengths .",
    "nevertheless , their determination of ly@xmath13 absorber clustering is broadly consistent with what is expected for galaxies at high redshift , and their estimate of the evolutionary parameter @xmath45 is consistent with ours .",
    "the growth of the correlation function of heavy  element absorbers , as shown in figure 5 and if extrapolated to zero redshift using the evolving power law ( eq . [ 3 ] ) , implies a large value for the present  day value of the correlation length : @xmath12  ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "this value is several times larger than the average value for field galaxies today , viz .",

    "comparing all these values of the correlation length suggests that , on megaparsec scales , the strong  and  absorbers in the vanden berk  ( 1998 ) catalog are tracing the distribution of clusters , or of the most luminous super-@xmath102 galaxies in those clusters .    of course",
    ", extrapolating our best fit in figure 5 to zero redshift is highly uncertain , as reflected in the broad range in our estimate of @xmath40 today , and is dependent on an assumed power ",

    "this makes a determination of heavy  element absorber clustering at low redshift all the more important ; however , the sample of low ",
    "redshift heavy  element absorption  line systems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) is too small at present to be useful in this regard .",
    "it is not yet clear whether the correlation function shown in figure 1 represents motion of absorbers inside a galaxy cluster ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , rather than true spatial clustering , since along a line of sight we can not distinguish peculiar velocities from the hubble flow .",
    "in fact , on the scales considered here , the same ambiguity would arise with galaxies themselves .",
    "what is clear , however , is that the _ scale _ ( @xmath103 3.4 , corresponding to @xmath104 610   at @xmath1 ) , the _ form _ ( @xmath105 ) , and the _ amplitude _ of the clustering in figure 1 all are indicative of an association of strong absorbers with clusters .",
    "furthermore , this clustering is growing with time ( fig .  5 ) , and could represent actual growth in spatial clustering ( see below ) or an increase in the velocity of absorber motions inside clusters due to increasing cluster masses .    if heavy ",
    "element absorbers are indicative of galaxy clusters , how do their number densities compare ?",
    "the number of strong heavy  element absorption  line systems per unit redshift along a line of sight is @xmath106 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "taking @xmath107 and @xmath108 to be , respectively , the characteristic comoving number density and effective cross section of the absorbers , and defining @xmath109 to be the number of systems per comoving length , we obtain ( @xcite , @xmath6 ) : @xmath110 taking for an upper limit of @xmath108 a cross section characteristic of clusters having size an abell radius @xmath111 , viz .",

    "this means there must be , _ on average _ , several strong heavy ",
    "element absorbers per cluster in space .    then , if the strong clustering seen in the line  of  sight correlation function of these absorbers is indicative of clustering on galaxy cluster scales , they must be _ biased _ tracers of higher density regions of space .",

    "( two other prominent features , albeit of lower significance , were also seen in the redshift histogram of the lyman break galaxies , and both have counterparts in metal line systems . ) a similar coherence between the large  scale distribution of high  redshift galaxies ( @xmath122 ) and that of absorbing gas has also been reported by francis  ( 1996 ) .",
    "( 2 ) giavalisco  ( 1998 ) have estimated the amplitude of the correlation function of the aforementioned lyman break galaxies at a median redshift @xmath123 , and find a correlation length @xmath124  ( @xmath6 ) , a value consistent with that we have found for the absorbers in figure 5 ( @xmath125  at @xmath126 ) .    in a detailed three  dimensional numerical investigation of the evolution ( from @xmath127 to @xmath128 ) of structure in the distribution of ly@xmath13 absorbers ,",
    "zhang  ( 1998 ) have found that the richest absorbers [ @xmath129 , and , correspondingly , heavy  element systems , tend to concentrate in nodules at the intersection of filamentary structures ( with comoving separation of a few megaparsecs at @xmath128 ) comprising the clustering network .",
    "those nodules appear to represent the locus of galaxy clusters .",
    "the scale of clustering found in our study of heavy  element absorption  line systems ( @xmath83  at @xmath130 ) appears consistent with this picture , and suggests that these systems are indeed tracing the richer agglomerations of the clustering network .",
    "the previous finding by qvy of superclustering of  absorbers on 100  scales suggests the existence of clustering in the nodules as well .",
    "the strong clustering that we find in the heavy  element absorption  line systems is also not surprising , given that most of the sample consists of the strongest systems with relatively large equivalent widths ( order 0.4   and greater ) , and the recent claims ( @xcite ; @xcite ) of a strong dependence of clustering strength on the column density of the systems .",
    "the median  @xmath131 rest equivalent width in our sample is @xmath132  , and there are few systems with @xmath133  .",
    "we have divided the sample in half by equivalent width , and computed the mean correlation function @xmath134 averaged for comoving scales between 1  and 16 .",
    "we find that the weaker systems appear to be less clustered than the stronger systems : @xmath135 , @xmath136 ; however , the sample size is not sufficient to significantly test the dependence of clustering on equivalent width .",
    "the growth in the correlation function and the value of the evolutionary parameter ( @xmath91 ) that we find , are consistent with gravitationally induced growth of perturbations . for @xmath6 , from linear theory of gravitational instability ( @xcite , 1993 ) @xmath137 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath138 if @xmath62 .",
    "also , from numerical simulations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , @xmath139 .",
    "it is possible ( eq .",
    "[ 4 ] ) to examine the evolution of the correlation function , using the growth factor @xmath47 from linear theory of gravitational instability ( @xcite , 1993 ) ; however , because of the uncertainties in our determination of the evolutionary parameter @xmath45 and our lack of understanding of the exact nature of the heavy  element absorbers , it is not possible to derive values for the cosmological parameters @xmath140 and @xmath141 from this work .",
    "a fruitful approach in the future may be more detailed numerical simulations of the heavy ",
    "element absorber network , like those of zhang  ( 1998 ) for the ly@xmath13 forest .",
    "in addition , results from the upcoming sloan digital sky survey will add greatly to our understanding of the absorbers .",
    "we summarize our results :    \\1 . we have analyzed the clustering of  and absorption  line systems on comoving scales @xmath0 from 1 to 16 , using an extensive catalog of heavy  element qso absorbers with mean redshift @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we find that , for the  sample as a whole , the absorber line  of  sight correlation function is well  fit by a power law of the form @xmath3 , with maximum  likelihood values of @xmath4 and comoving @xmath5  ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the clustering of absorbers at high redshift is thus of a _ form _ that is consistent with that found for galaxies and clusters at low redshift , and of amplitude such that absorbers are correlated on scales of clusters of galaxies .",
    "it appears that the absorbers are tracing the large  scale structure seen in the distribution of galaxies and clusters , and are doing so at high redshift .",
    "the finding strengthens the case for using absorbers in probing large  scale structure .",
    "we also trace the _ evolution _ of the mean amplitude @xmath7 of the correlation function , as a function of redshift , from @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "we find that , when parametrized in the conventional manner as @xmath10 , the amplitude grows with decreasing redshift , with maximum  likelihood value for the evolutionary parameter of @xmath91 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "when extrapolated to zero redshift , the amplitude of the correlation function implies that the correlation length @xmath12  ( @xmath6 ) , suggesting that strong  and  absorbers , on megaparsec scales , are tracing the distribution of clusters of galaxies , or of the most luminous super-@xmath102 galaxies in those clusters .",
    "the scale of clustering suggests that these absorbers are biased tracers of the higher  density regions of space , and that agglomerations of strong absorbers along a line of sight are indicators of clusters and superclusters .",
    "this is supported by recent observations of lyman break galaxies .",
    "the growth seen in the clustering of absorbers is consistent with gravitationally induced growth of perturbations .",
