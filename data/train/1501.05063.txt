    "scattering of electrons by impurities in disordered crystals leads to anderson localization @xcite , which determines the conductor - insulator transitions in metals @xcite , quasi - crystals @xcite and granular metal films @xcite , and is associated with many interesting phenomena , such as the quantized phases of the integer hall effect @xcite . if written in a second - quantized form , the hamiltonian of an electron in a disordered lattice can be mapped onto the hamiltonians for a variety of systems @xcite .",
    "this mapping can be used to study transport properties of electrons in disordered lattices by examining the properties of other quantum particles and quasi - particles .",
    "for example , disordered - induced localization has been studied with microwaves in a tubular waveguide @xcite , optical photons in opaque media @xcite and ultracold atoms in optical lattices @xcite . despite these studies ,",
    "there are still many open questions about anderson localization . for example , the scaling hypothesis providing the relation between quantum localization in systems of different dimensionality @xcite still awaits experimental confirmation . equally important and widely debated",
    "are the effects of inter - particle interactions @xcite and dissipative forces @xcite on localization in far - from - equilibrium systems or the role of long - range tunnelling amplitudes @xcite allowing particles to transition between distant lattice sites .",
    "the development of experimental methods for producing molecules at ultracold temperatures has created new possibilities for studying disorder - induced localization .",
    "as demonstrated in recent experiments @xcite , an ensemble of ultracold krb diatoms , produced by photoassociation of ultracold k and rb atoms and trapped in an optical lattice , forms a random spatial distribution of krb molecules in the ro - vibrational ground state .",
    "if the trapping field of the optical lattice has high intensity , the molecular motion is strongly confined and the spatial distribution is quasi - stationary , eliminating molecule - molecule collisions .",
    "the excitation of molecules from the rotational ground state to the lowest rotationally excited state leads to the formation of delocalized excitations @xcite , representing the wave packets of rotational frenkel excitons @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to explore if these wave packets can be used as probe particles to study dynamics of localization induced by the disorder potential stemming from the randomness of the molecular positions .",
    "the rotational excitations in an ensemble of polar molecules randomly distributed on an optical lattice possess several unique properties :    * the rotationally excited states of molecules have long radiative lifetimes ( @xmath3 sec ) , allowing one to probe coherent dynamics over long time scales .",
    "* the rotational excitations can be placed on molecules in well defined lattice sites .",
    "this can be achieved by applying a spatial gradient of an electric field and a microwave field pulse resonant with rotational transitions for molecules in the desired part of the lattice @xcite .",
    "the rotational excitations thus produced form spatially localized wave packets @xcite .",
    "once the gradient of the field is removed , these wave packets can travel throughout lattice due to resonant energy transfer between molecules , undergoing quantum walk @xcite and scattering by empty lattice sites . by shaping the gradient of the field ,",
    "it may be possible to prepare the excitation wave packets representing superpositions of excitations in spatially separated lattice sites , thus enabling the controlled study of the role of initial conditions and entanglement between spatially separated particles on the dynamics of quantum walk .",
    "* the interactions between the rotational excitations can be tuned by applying a dc electric field @xcite . *",
    "the transfer of rotational excitations between molecules is enabled by long - range dipole - dipole interactions , leading to long - range transfer of excitations between distant lattice sites .",
    "this can be used to study the effects of long - range tunnelling on disorder - induced localization . *",
    "the translational motion of molecules can be controlled by varying the strength of the optical lattice potential . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the translational motion of molecules can be coupled to the rotational excitations .",
    "this can be used to study disorder - induced localization and diffusion of quantum particles in the presence of controlled coupling to a dissipative environment . *",
    "the optical lattice potential can be designed to produce a three - dimensional ( 3d ) finite lattice of molecules or to separate molecules in one or two dimensions , effectively confining the rotational excitations to one - dimensional ( 1d ) or two - dimensional ( 2d ) disordered lattices @xcite .",
    "these properties make the rotational excitations in spatially disordered ensembles of ultracold molecules a unique new platform for the study of quantum walk and disorder - induced localization .",
    "in particular , the ability to change the dimensionality of the optical lattice potential opens up a unique possibility to verify the universality of anderson localization in different dimensionalities @xcite and the ability to tune the interactions between the rotational excitations @xcite suggests a new way to study the effects of particle interactions on anderson localization .",
    "however , the microscopic hamiltonian describing rotational excitations in an optical lattice leads to a specific model corresponding to a quantum particle moving on a lattice with the same on - site energy but with forbidden access to random sites , with the tunnelling amplitudes decaying as the inverse cube of the hopping distance . whether or not such a model can be used to observe anderson localization in finite , or even infinite @xcite , 2d systems and whether or not such a model allows anderson localization in 3d systems of any size @xcite is  to the best of our knowledge  unknown @xcite .",
    "the specific goal of this work is to consider the following questions :    * while quantum particles placed in a 2d disordered potential are generally expected to undergo anderson localization @xcite , the localization length is sensitive to the microscopic details of the particle - disorder interactions and can be very large . given that the experiments with optical lattices employ finite ensembles of molecules , typically with less than 100 sites per dimension , is the disorder potential for rotational excitations in a partially populated optical lattice strong enough to allow for observations of anderson localization in 2d systems on the length scale of 100 lattice sites ?",
    "* if the disorder potential is strong enough to induce anderson localization in finite 2d arrays , what is the minimum concentration of lattice vacancies leading to localization lengths less than 100 lattice sites ? * quantum particles placed in a 3d disordered potential may or may not undergo anderson localization @xcite , depending on the microscopic details of the particle - disorder interactions . is the disorder potential for rotational excitations in 3d disordered ensembles strong enough to induce anderson localization ? * what is the effect of the long - range tunnelling amplitudes on the dynamics in the disordered system of this specific kind ? * what is the time scale of the disorder - induced localization , if any , for excitations placed in specific lattice sites ?",
    "+ if the disorder potential is too weak , the localization dynamics may not be observable over experimentally feasible time scales .",
    "if the disorder potential is too strong , localized rotational wave packets may remain pinned to their original location and not exhibit any dynamics of quantum walk over experimentally feasible time scales .",
    "questions ( i ) - ( iv ) are general for the lattice model with tunnelling amplitudes randomly omitted and the results pertaining to question ( v ) can be renormalized for a particular system by re - scaling the time dependence of observables . to answer these questions , we consider the dynamics of rotational excitations placed in individual sites of an optical lattice partially populated with krb molecules .",
    "to simulate an experiment with destructive measurements , we average the dynamics of rotational energy transfer between molecules in the disordered ensembles over multiple disorder orientations and examine the time scales of the formation of disorder - induced distributions of rotational excitations in lattices of various dimensionality . we examine the effects of the long - range tunnelling amplitudes in lattices of various dimensionality and discuss the effect of disorder on diffusion of rotational excitations in lattices of various dimensionality .",
    "the hamiltonian for an ensemble of molecules on an optical lattice of arbitrary dimensionality can be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the hamiltonian of an isolated molecule placed in lattice site @xmath6 positioned at @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the lattice constant , and @xmath9 is the dipole - dipole interaction between molecules in sites @xmath6 and @xmath10 .",
    "the vector index is @xmath11 for 1d lattices , @xmath12 for 2d lattices and @xmath13 for 3d lattices , with each of @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 running from @xmath17 to @xmath18 , so that @xmath19 is the number of lattice sites per dimension .",
    "we assume that the translational motion of molecules can be neglected .",
    "this approximation is valid for the trapping field potential with the trapping frequency exceeding @xmath20 khz @xcite .    following the experimental work in ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume that each molecule is initially in the lowest eigenstate of @xmath5 , corresponding to zero rotational angular momentum @xmath21 of the molecule . some of the molecules are subsequently excited to an isolated hyperfine state within the triplet of the hyperfine states corresponding to the rotational angular momentum @xmath22 and the projection of @xmath23 on the space - fixed quantization axis @xmath24 . the lowest energy state and this specific excited state for the molecule in site @xmath6 are hereafter denoted as @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the states @xmath27 and @xmath28 have the opposite parity .",
    "since the dipole - dipole interaction operator can be written as a sum over products of rank-1 spherical tensors acting on the subspace of the individual molecules , the matrix elements @xmath29 vanish so the molecules are non - interacting when in the ground state . however , the dipole - dipole interaction has non - zero matrix elements between the product states @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath32 stimulate resonant energy transfer of the @xmath33 excitation between molecules in sites @xmath6 and @xmath10 .",
    "for the specific states @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the matrix elements ( [ t - elements ] ) have the following form : @xmath36 where @xmath37 debye is the permanent dipole moment of krb molecules @xcite , @xmath38 is the angle between the intermolecular axis joining the molecules in lattice sites @xmath6 and @xmath10 and the @xmath39-axis .",
    "we assume that @xmath40 for 1d and 2d lattices .",
    "the molecules are trapped in a lattice with lattice constant @xmath41 nm @xcite . for the specific system considered here ,",
    "the value of these matrix elements is @xmath42 with @xmath43 hz .",
    "the matrix elements ( [ t - elements ] ) also lead to the delocalized character of the rotational excitations . in general",
    ", the @xmath33 excitation generates the following many - body excited state : @xmath44 in an ideal lattice , the coefficients @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xcite , i.e. a rotational excitation completely delocalized over the entire lattice . if the lattice is disordered , the excited state is a localized coherent superposition of the frenkel excitons with different @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "when the lattice is partially filled with molecules , the excitation energy of the molecular ensemble depends on the location of molecules in the excited state .",
    "the excited states of the many - body system of molecules in a disordered lattice are the eigenstates of the following hamiltonian : @xmath48 where the operator @xmath49 removes an excitation from site @xmath6 , @xmath50 is the excitation energy of a molecule in site @xmath6 , if the site is populated , and zero otherwise . the transition amplitudes @xmath51 are given by eq .",
    "( [ t - elements ] ) if both of the sites @xmath6 and @xmath10 are populated by molecules and zero otherwise .",
    "it is this disorder in the transition amplitudes @xmath51 that localizes the delocalized excitations .    in order to compute the time - evolution of the rotational excitations , we diagonalize the matrix of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) in the site - representation basis @xmath52 , where the vacuum state is @xmath53 and @xmath6 running only over the lattice sites populated with molecules .",
    "the eigenstates of the full hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , @xmath54 are then used to compute the time evolution of the excitation wave packet as follows @xmath55 where @xmath56 are the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , the coefficients @xmath57 and the coefficients @xmath58 are the projections of the excitation wave packet at @xmath59 onto the eigenstates of the hamiltonian , @xmath60 the quantities @xmath61 are averaged over multiple calculations with different realizations of disorder ( i.e. different random distributions of empty lattice sites ) .    as will be demonstrated in the following section , the rotational excitations scattered by the empty lattice sites form peaked distributions . in this article",
    ", we will use two measures of distributions : the distribution width @xmath62 and the standard deviation @xmath63 .",
    "the distribution width @xmath62 is defined as the length of the lattice ( for a 1d lattice ) , the radius of a circle ( for a 2d lattice ) or the radius of a sphere ( for a 3d lattice ) containing 90 % of the excitation probability .",
    "the standard deviation is defined as @xmath64 , where @xmath65 for a 1d lattice , @xmath66 for a 2d lattice and @xmath67 for a 3d lattice .",
    "the distribution width characterizes the physical spread of the rotational excitation over the molecular ensemble .",
    "however , this quantity may be significantly affected by fluctuations due to specific disorder realizations .",
    "the standard deviation depends on the shape of the distribution but is less affected by the fluctuations .",
    "we will use the standard deviation in order to characterize non - ambiguously the dynamical properties such as the time dependence of the distributions .",
    "as originally proposed by demille @xcite , ultracold molecules trapped in an optical lattice can be selectively excited by applying a gradient of a dc electric field that separates the rotational energy levels of molecules in different lattice sites by a different magnitude .",
    "this method can , in principle , be used to excite rotationally a single molecule in a specific lattice site .",
    "if the gradient of the field is removed , the rotational excitation thus generated may be transferred to molecules in other lattice sites by resonant energy transfer .",
    "the dynamics of this energy transfer can be probed by applying another gradient of the dc electric field at time @xmath68 and detecting either the excited molecules or molecules remaining in the ground state using resonantly - enhanced multiphoton ionization ( rempi ) .",
    "the rempi detection is a destructive measurement .",
    "if the optical lattice is partially populated with randomly distributed molecules , repeating the experiment multiple times to determine the dependence of rotational energy transfer on @xmath68 is equivalent to averaging over different realizations of disorder ( i.e. different distributions of empty lattice sites ) .    in order to simulate the outcome of such measurements",
    ", we consider an optical lattice partially populated with randomly distributed krb molecules .",
    "we compute the time evolution of a rotational excitation placed in a single lattice site at @xmath59 and average the results at each @xmath68 over multiple random distributions of empty lattice sites with a fixed concentration of vacancies .",
    "figures 1 , 2 and 3 illustrate the characteristic distributions of rotational excitations as a result of quantum walk of a single rotational excitation initially placed in the centre of a 1d , 2d ( square ) or 3d ( cubic ) lattice , respectively .",
    "in the following sections , we explore the detailed dynamics of how these distributions are formed and the role of long - range tunnelling effects in determining the quantum walk dynamics .",
    "a quantum particle placed in a 1d disordered lattice must undergo anderson localization @xcite .",
    "mapped onto a rotational excitation travelling in a disordered ensemble of molecules , this well - known result is reflected in the formation of the exponentially localized distributions shown in figure 1 .",
    "these distributions characterize the probability of molecules in the corresponding lattice sites to be in the rotationally excited state .",
    "figure 1 illustrates that rotational excitations in an optical lattice partially populated with molecules behave as quantum particles in a disordered lattice .",
    "it is important to note that the distributions presented in figure 1 are time - independent .",
    "although the rotational excitation initially placed in a specific lattice site represents a wave packet that , given sufficient time , can potentially explore the entire lattice and exhibit revivals , the averaging over disorder realizations leads to stationary distributions in the limit of long time . in order to illustrate this , we present in figure 4 the distributions of the rotational excitation computed at different times .",
    "the lower panel of figure 4 illustrates the time dependence of the distribution width @xmath62 in a 1d lattice with the vacancy concentrations 10 % and 20 % .",
    "the results show that for the parameters representing rotational excitations in an ensemble of krb molecules , the averaged excitation probability distributions change most significantly at @xmath68 between zero and 100 - 300 ms .",
    "the distribution widths exhibit a temporary peak at short times .",
    "this oscillation survives the averaging over disorder realizations and is present in the results for different concentrations of vacancies . since the distribution width presented in figure 4 is much smaller than the lattice size ( @xmath69 )",
    ", this short - time oscillation can not be due to reflection from the lattice boundaries and is likely the result of constructive interference due to back - scattering of the rotational excitation from the empty lattice sites .",
    "as indicated by the results in the lower panel of figure 4 , the approach to the stationary distributions is determined by the strength of the disorder potential , i.e. the concentration of lattice vacancies .",
    "this is illustrated more clearly in the upper panel of figure 5 showing the time dependence of the standard deviations @xmath63 for different concentrations of vacancies .",
    "figure 5 demonstrates that the rotational excitations in a 1d lattice of krb molecules reach the time - independent distributions in less than one second , provided the vacancy concentration is @xmath70 .",
    "it is instructive to examine the dependence of the minimum time required to form the stationary distributions on the concentration of vacancies .",
    "figure 6 shows the time @xmath71 required for a rotational excitation initially placed in the center of a lattice to form a time - independent distribution as a function of vacancy concentration in lattices of different dimensionality .",
    "interestingly , figure 6 reveals that the dependence of @xmath71 on the vacancy concentration is qualitatively different for lattices of different dimensionality . in 1d lattices",
    ", @xmath71 is a monotonically decaying function of the vacancy concentration .",
    "this illustrates that increasing the disorder of 1d lattices impedes the dynamics of quantum walk leading to narrower distributions of the rotational excitation ( cf .",
    ", figure 1 ) and decreases the time required to reach the stationary distributions ( less time since the quantum walker has less space to explore ) .",
    "the calculations shown in figure 6 have two implications : ( i ) the time evolution of the rotational excitations in 1d disordered lattices can be used as a probe of the disorder strength ; ( ii ) the mechanisms for the formation of the distributions shown in figures 1 - 3 are different for lattices of different dimensionality . in the following section ,",
    "we correlate the rising or falling dependence of @xmath71 on the concentration of vacancies with the regime of classical diffusion or sub - diffusion , arguing that the sign of the gradient of @xmath71 can be used as a signature of sub - diffusion stimulated by anderson localization .",
    "as can be seen from figures 2 and 3 and the comparison of the different curves in figures 5 and 6 , the dynamics of rotational energy transfer between molecules trapped in 2d and 3d lattices is quantitatively and qualitatively different from the localization dynamics in 1d lattices .",
    "it is apparent that the formation of localized distributions requires higher concentrations of vacancies and the approach to time - independent distributions takes longer time in lattices of higher dimensionality .",
    "in particular , figure 6 reveals that the dependence of the time @xmath71 required to reach a stationary distribution on the vacancy concentration is qualitatively different for lattices of different dimensionality . in 1d lattices ,",
    "@xmath71 is a monotonically decaying function of the vacancy concentration . in 2d lattices ,",
    "@xmath71 exhibits a maximum as a function of the vacancy concentration . in 3d lattices",
    ", @xmath71 increases monotonically with the disorder strength .    in order to elucidate the dynamics of quantum",
    "walk in higher dimensions and the implications of figure 6 , we present in figure 7 the time dependence of the distribution widths @xmath62 computed for a rotational excitation in 2d and 3d lattices of varying size with varying concentrations of vacant sites .",
    "the results for the 2d lattices illustrate that at low concentration of vacancies ( 20 % ) corresponding to the range , where the dependence of @xmath71 on the disorder strength rises , the rotational excitation width approaches the size of the lattice in the limit of long time .",
    "this shows that the localization length of the excitation for this concentration of vacancies is greater than the size of the lattice .",
    "when the concentration of empty sites is 70 % , the rotational excitation in a 2d lattice is well localized and the different curves shown in figure 7 converge to the same value in the limit of long time .",
    "this localization regime corresponds to the range in figure 6 , where @xmath71 decreases with the disorder strength .    since the experiments with ultracold molecules on optical lattices employ finite samples of molecules , typically @xmath72 per dimension @xcite , it is important to find the threshold concentration of vacancies that leads to localized states in 2d lattices with dimension @xmath73 . by repeating the calculation of figure 7 for different concentrations of vacancies , we find that @xmath74 , when the concentration of vacancies exceeds @xmath75 .",
    "this is consistent with the results in figure 6 , which shows that the dependence of @xmath71 on the vacancy concentration exhibits a maximum at the concentration of vacancies between @xmath76 and @xmath75 .",
    "we conclude that the rotational excitations can be localized in 2d disordered lattices of molecules with @xmath77 lattice sites , provided the concentration of vacancies is @xmath78 .",
    "the calculations for the rotational excitation dynamics in 3d lattices ( lower panel of figure 7 ) show that , for each of the lattices considered , the distribution width approaches the size of the lattice in the limit of long time , even for the concentration of empty sites as large as 90 % .",
    "this indicates that the rotational excitation in 3d lattices with 90 % of empty sites is allowed to diffuse to the edges of the lattice .",
    "this is also consistent with the results in figure 6 showing that @xmath71 rises monotonically for 3d lattices .",
    "this indicates that the rotational excitations do not exhibit anderson localization on the length scale considered . to prove this",
    ", we compare the dynamics of the spatial expansion of the rotational excitations in 3d disordered lattices with classical diffusion .",
    "the diffusion of quantum particles in disordered lattices can be examined for an alternative signature of anderson localization .",
    "a quantum particle with cosine dispersion placed in an individual site of an ideal lattice expands ballistically to form a distribution with the standard deviation @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the diffusion of a classical particle in brownian motion is characterized by @xmath80 . in the presence of anderson localization , the diffusive dynamics must be suppressed .",
    "the time - dependence of @xmath63 can thus be used as a quantitative measure of quantum interference , constructive or destructive , on particle propagation in disordered lattices .",
    "the upper panels of figure 8 ( 2d lattices ) and figure 9 ( 3d lattices ) show the time dependence of @xmath81 computed for 2d and 3d lattices with various concentrations of empty lattice sites . as expected , we find that @xmath82 for ideal lattices , both in 2d and 3d . however , the time - dependence of @xmath81 is dramatically modified by the presence of vacancies .",
    "in particular , figure 8 illustrates that the rotational excitation in disordered lattices expands ballistically at short times with @xmath82 and exhibits the dependence @xmath83 , characteristic of the diffusive regime , at later times . that @xmath81 becomes a linear function of time illustrates that the presence of vacancies destroys interferences accelerating diffusion of quantum particles @xcite . at even later times",
    "( @xmath84 ms ) , the dependence of @xmath81 on time departs from linearity and the propagation of the rotational excitations enters a sub - diffusive regime ( @xmath85 with @xmath86 ) .",
    "this can happen either because of anderson localization or because of the reflection from the boundaries .",
    "since the calculations of figures 8 and 9 are performed for finite lattices , it is important to examine the effects of the boundaries . in particular",
    ", it is important to determine if the departure of @xmath81 from linearity is due to disorder or due to the finite size effects . in order to do this ,",
    "we first consider the ballistic expansion of the rotational excitations in ideal lattices of varying size ( upper right panels of figures 8 and 9 ) .",
    "we observe that , for each lattice size , @xmath81 increases as a quadratic function of time at @xmath87 , until the reflection from the boundaries slows down the ballistic expansion .",
    "we denote by @xmath88 the time , at which the dependence of @xmath81 on time in an ideal lattice departs from the quadratic function due to the reflection from the boundaries .",
    "the insets of figures 8 and 9 show the dependence of @xmath88 on the lattice size . in the presence of disorder ,",
    "the expansion is significantly slower and the reflection from the boundaries must occur at times later than @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , we can use the time @xmath88 as the lower limit for the onset of the boundary effects and conclude that the dynamics , whether in disordered or ideal lattices , is not affected by the boundary effects at @xmath87 .",
    "the lower panel of figure 8 shows that the dynamics of rotational excitations in 2d lattices with the disorder concentration @xmath78 enters the sub - diffusive regime at times @xmath87 .",
    "this proves that the transition to the sub - diffusive regimes at these concentration of vacancies is due to disorder - induced localization , and not due to the boundary effects . for the disorder concentration @xmath89",
    ", we observe that the departure of @xmath81 from linearity occurs at @xmath90 .",
    "these observations are consistent with the results of figures 6 and 7 .",
    "we thus conclude that the increase of the time required for the formation of the stationary distributions shown in figure 6 reflects that increasing the disorder strength slows down the diffusion of rotational excitations to the lattice boundaries , hence the dramatically different dependence of @xmath71 on the disorder strength for 2d ( at low vacancy concentrations ) and 3d lattices from that in 1d lattices .    for 3d lattices",
    ", the transition to the sub - diffusive regimes always occurs at @xmath90 , indicating ( but not proving ) that the departure of @xmath81 from linearity is due to the finite size of the system , and not the scattering by disorder .",
    "the lower panel of figure 9 shows the results for an extreme case of a 3d lattice with 90 % of the lattice sites vacant . to prove that the disorder does not lead to the sub - diffusive regime in 3d lattices",
    ", we perform the calculations illustrated in the lower panel of figure 9 for different lattice sizes . for each lattice size",
    ", we determine the time @xmath91 , at which the expansion of @xmath92 undergoes the transition to the sub - diffusive regime .",

    "the effect of the long - range matrix elements appears to depend both on the strength of the disorder potential and the dimensionality . to elucidate these dependencies , we present in figure 11 the ratio of the distribution widths computed in the limit of long time with the long - range amplitudes @xmath100 and the short - range amplitudes @xmath107 .",
    "the long - range matrix elements appear to have little effect at low concentrations of empty sites , but increase the distribution widths by a factor of 2 or more at large concentrations of vacancies .",
    "the results presented in figure 11 indicate that the long - range tunnelling amplitudes @xmath51 play little role at low disorder strengths in lattices of higher dimensionality , i.e. when the dynamics is expected to be more dominated by diffusion . at the same time",
    ", figure 11 shows that the long - range matrix elements become exceedingly important in the regime where disorder - induced localization is expected to dominate . in order to illustrate this more clearly",
    ", we show in figure 12 the distribution widths @xmath62 computed as functions of time for 2d lattices with two concentrations of vacancies : 20 % corresponding to the regime dominated by diffusion ( cf . figures 6 and 8) and 70 % corresponding to the regime , where the rotational excitations in 2d lattices are well localized .",
    "the results show that the long - range tunnelling amplitudes insignificantly accelerate the expansion dynamics of the rotational excitation in the diffusive regime , enhancing the distribution widths at short times by about 20 % or less ( upper panel of figure 12 ) . in stark contrast , the distribution widths obtained with the two types of tunnelling amplitudes are dramatically different in the regime of strong localization ( lower panel of figure 12 ) .",
    "in this work , we study the dynamics of quantum walk of rotational excitations in finite disordered 1d , 2d and 3d ensembles of ultracold molecules trapped in optical lattices .",
    "the disorder arises from incomplete populations of optical lattices with molecules .",
    "thus , the rotational excitations travelling between molecules in a partially populated optical lattice are described by the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , which can be obtained from the tight - binding lattice model by randomly omitting some of the tunnelling amplitudes and extending the remaining tunnelling amplitudes to decay as @xmath108 . while the dynamics of particles described by such a hamiltonian should be expected to exhibit the general features of quantum particles in a disordered potential , whether or not such a model can be used to observe anderson localization in finite 2d systems and whether or not such a model can be used to observe anderson localization in 3d systems ( finite or infinite ) , depends on the microscopic details of particle - disorder interactions .",
    "we note that there are only two free parameters in this hamiltonian : the magnitude of the constant @xmath109 in eq .",
    "( [ alpha - eq ] ) and the concentration of empty lattice sites .",
    "while the magnitude of @xmath109 determines the time scales of quantum walk and localization dynamics , the localization length in 1d and 2d systems and the presence or absence of anderson localization in 3d systems is entirely determined by the concentration of vacancies .    in order to guide the ongoing experiments with ultracold molecules",
    ", we chose the value of @xmath109 to correspond to a specific experimentally realized system of krb molecules on an optical lattice with lattice constant @xmath110 nm .",
    "we have confirmed that increasing the value of @xmath109 accelerates the time evolution of the dynamics but leads to the same results in the limit of long time .",
    "the qualitative features of the time - dependent results and the results in the limit of long time are , therefore , general for any system described by the hamiltonian considered here",
    ". the time - dependent results can be renormalized for other systems by changing the value of the coupling constant in eq .",
    "( [ t - elements ] ) , which controls the time - evolution of the system .    the main results of this work can be summarized as following :    * for the specific system of 1d arrays of krb molecules on an optical lattice with lattice constant @xmath110 nm , the rotational excitations placed in individual lattice sites form localized distributions within @xmath0 sec . with only 10 @xmath111 of vacancies ,",
    "the width of the exponentially localized distributions is @xmath112 @xmath8 .",
    "this indicates that anderson localization can be studied with rotational excitations in 1d arrays of molecules , providing coherence can be preserved for longer than 1 second . * in 2d , this particular type of disorder requires concentrations of empty lattice sites @xmath113 in order to localize the rotational excitations within @xmath77 sites .",
    "* for 3d disordered arrays with @xmath1 sites in each dimension , we observe no localization at vacancy concentrations @xmath114 , i.e. the rotational excitations generated in the middle of the lattice diffuse to the edges of the lattice as classical particles .",
    "the vacancy concentration @xmath115 is near the percolation threshold for a 3d network of sites @xcite .",
    "we note that the results of ref .",
    "@xcite indicate that the model for the particle with nearest - neighbour hopping on a lattice with random on - site energies and substitutional disorder does allow quantum localization in 3d .",
    "figure 5 of ref .",
    "@xcite suggests that quantum localization is present in a system with substitutional disorder even in the absence of disorder in the on - site energies .",
    "our results thus indicate ( but not yet prove ) that the interval of quantum localization in figure 5 of ref .",
    "@xcite between the regimes of diffusion and classical localization may be reduced to zero due to long - range tunnelling .",
    "this raises a general question whether quantum particles with long - range tunnelling can undergo quantum localization in 3d lattices with substitutional disorder . *",
    "our results show that the long - range character of the tunnelling amplitudes in the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) has little impact on the dynamics of particles in the diffusive regime ( i.e. in 2d and 3d lattices with low concentrations of vacancies ) but affects significantly the localization dynamics in lattices with large concentrations of vacancies , enhancing the width of the localized particle distributions in 2d lattices by a factor of 2 . *",
    "our results show that the diffusive vs localization regime can be identified by measuring the dependence of the minimum time @xmath71 ( cf .",
    "figure 6 ) required for a particle placed in a specific lattice site to form a time - independent averaged distribution as a function of vacancy concentration . * our calculations illustrate that the diffusion of rotational excitations placed in 2d lattices with disordered tunnelling amplitudes has three distinct time scales , which can be varied by changing the concentration of empty lattice sites . at short times , the dynamics is characterized by the quadratic time dependence of @xmath116 , characteristic of quantum particles with cosine dispersion .",
    "the rise of @xmath81 is suppressed by the disorder at later times .",
    "this suppression leads to an extended time interval , where @xmath81 exhibits a linear dependence on time , characteristic of classical diffusion .",
    "this interval of time increases with decreasing disorder strength and can be as long as @xmath117 ms for the dynamics of in a 2d lattice with 50 @xmath111 of empty sites . at still longer times",
    ", the dependence of @xmath81 on time is sub - diffusive , i.e. slower than linear .",
    "this suggests that rotational excitations in 2d disordered ensembles of polar molecules can be used to study the crossover from ballistic expansion to classical diffusion , where quantum interferences enhancing diffusion are suppressed . at longer times",
    ", the dynamics of rotational excitations in 2d lattices can be used to study the crossover from classical diffusion to a sub - diffusive regime , where quantum interferences leading to localization become important .    in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we showed that the rotational excitations of molecules on an optical lattice can be coupled to the translational motion of molecules , leading to the formation of polarons with a wide range of tunable properties @xcite .",
    "we also showed that , if the molecules on an optical lattice are subjected to dc electric fields , the rotational excitations exhibit strong interactions that may  depending on the electric field strength  lead to the formation of quasi - particle bound pairs @xcite . in combination with this previous work ,",
