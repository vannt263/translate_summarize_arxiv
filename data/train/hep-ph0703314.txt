    "analogous spectral integrals , @xmath18 , are obtained from @xmath19 by rescaling the integrand with @xmath20 before integration . in what follows we denote by @xmath21 the weighted spectral integral from threshold to @xmath22 involving the analytic weight , @xmath23 , and either of the correlators @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "all spectral integrals discussed above satisfy the general finite energy sum rule ( fesr ) relation @xmath26 and hence have an alternate , ope representation for sufficiently large @xmath27 .",
    "the fesr s corresponding to @xmath18 are called the `` @xmath28 spectral weight sum rules '' . the purely @xmath10 term in an `` inclusive '' sum rule ( one with both @xmath10 and @xmath29 spectral contributions )",

    "an uncertainty @xmath40 in @xmath31 thus produces a fractional uncertainty @xmath41 in @xmath42 _ much _ smaller than that on @xmath31 itself .",
    "moderate precision for @xmath31 thus suffices for a high precision determination of @xmath42 , provided experimental errors can be brought under control  @xcite . at present ,",
    "the accuracy of the method is limited by the sizeable ( statistics limited ) uncertainties on the @xmath38 spectral distribution ( which produce @xmath43 uncertainties on the @xmath38 spectral integrals , and hence @xmath44 errors on @xmath42 ) .",
    "these errors will be radically reduced in the near future through analyses , already in progress , of the new @xmath1 decay data from babar and belle .",
    "we thus concentrate here on the issue of controlling ope - induced errors .",
    "the results reported below are all based on the aleph @xmath37 and @xmath38 spectral data  @xcite , aleph being the only collaboration which has made its @xmath38 covariance matrix publicly available .",
    "the reported results have been rescaled to take into account current values of the various branching fractions  @xcite . in the case of the @xmath38 data ,",
    "this is done following the prescription described in refs .",
    "details of the ope input employed , and the method used to estimate the @xmath2 truncation uncertainty ( which is much more conservative than those used previously in the literature ) may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the first important technical complication is the very bad behavior of the integrated longitudinal @xmath2 ope series .",
    "not only does the series show no sign of converging , even at the maximum scale , @xmath45 , allowed by @xmath1 decay kinematics  @xcite but , even worse , it badly violates spectral positivity constraints for _ all _ truncation schemes used in the literature  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the problem is easily handled phenomenologically .",
    "the basic reason is that the longitudinal decay contributions are , for a combination of chiral and kinematic reasons , strongly dominated by the @xmath46 and @xmath47 pole terms  @xcite .",
    "these terms are very accurately known .",
    "the residual non - pole ( `` continuum '' ) contributions can , moreover , be well - constrained using the approaches described in refs .",
    "bin - by - bin subtractions of the longitudinal contributions to the experimental decay distributions can thus be made , allowing direct determinations of the @xmath48 spectral functions , from which fesr s not afflicted by the problematic longitudinal @xmath2 ope behavior can be constructed . _",
    "the extremely bad behavior of the longitudinal ope series makes inclusive analyses employing the longitudinal ope representation untenable , and the longitudinal subtraction process unavoidable . _",
    "the second technical complication is the slow convergence of the @xmath2 @xmath49 ope series , which is known exactly to @xmath50 and given by  @xcite @xmath51^{ope}_{d=2}\\ , = \\ , { \\frac{3}{2\\pi^2}}\\ , { \\frac{\\bar{m}_s}{q^2 } } \\left [ 1 + 2.333 \\bar{a}+\\right .",

    "since independent high - scale determinations of @xmath57  @xcite correspond to @xmath58 , the convergence at the spacelike point on @xmath59 , for @xmath60 , is marginal at best . for the @xmath49 , @xmath61 spectral weights , @xmath62 , with @xmath63 , the factor @xmath64 peaks more and more strongly in the spacelike direction with increasing @xmath65 .",
    "slow convergence of the integrated @xmath2 series , deteriorating with increasing @xmath65 , is thus expected for the @xmath61 spectral weights , an expectation borne out by the results of refs .",
    "fig .  1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite also shows no consistent common @xmath34 , @xmath0 fit region exists for the @xmath66-truncated version of those @xmath61 spectral weight sum rules employed previously in the literature .",
    "since terms higher order in @xmath67 are relatively more important at lower scales , a signal of the premature truncation of a slowly converging ope series is an unphysical @xmath27 dependence to the truncated sum .",
    "such an unphysical dependence can be exposed by comparing the truncated ope and corresponding experimental spectral integrals over a range of @xmath27 .",
    "this comparison is shown for the @xmath3 spectral weight , for a range of input @xmath68 , in fig",
    "the value of @xmath42 needed for the spectral integral differences is obtained by fitting at @xmath45 .",
    "it is clear that no @xmath34 exists giving a good match between the ope and spectral integrals .",
    "one should bear in mind that very strong correlations exist amongst the ope integrals for different @xmath27 and , similarly , amongst the spectral integrals for different @xmath27 .",
    "the results thus clearly point to problems with controlling ope uncertainties in the @xmath61 spectral weight sum rules . that there is no obvious way to reduce the problematic @xmath2 ope truncation component of this uncertainty represents an important limitation to the use of the @xmath3 spectral weight sum rule as a means of determining @xmath42 .",
    "( 8.5,13.2 )    [ w00msrange ]    the fact that @xmath69 decreases as @xmath70 moves away from the spacelike point along the circle @xmath59 allows one to improve the convergence of the integrated @xmath49 , @xmath2 ope series by working with weights which emphasize those parts of the contour away from the spacelike point .",
    "three weights , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , designed specifically to produce improved convergence ( in addition to improved control of other features of the ope analysis ) were introduced in ref .",
    "a fourth such weight , @xmath74 , was introduced in ref .",
    "the improved convergence , and resulting much improved @xmath27-stability of @xmath42 , have been demonstrated previously  @xcite . here , in fig .",
    "[ w20w10msrange ] , we show the analogues of fig .  1 for the weights @xmath73 and @xmath71 ( the results for @xmath72 and @xmath74 are intermediate in quality , and hence not shown explicitly ) .",
    "the contrast to the @xmath3 spectral weight case is immediately evident .",
    "we have also shown elsewhere ( see fig .  4 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) that an excellent common fit region for @xmath34 and @xmath42 exists for the four non - spectral weights considered here , in sharp contrast to the lack of consistency found for the @xmath61 spectral weights .",
    "( 8.5,13.2 )    ( 8.5,13.2 )",
    "single non - spectral weight , @xmath45 , fits , using as input the average , @xmath75 mev , of strange scalar and pseudoscalar sum rule  @xcite and @xmath76 lattice results  @xcite , advocated in the last of refs .",
    "@xcite , yield @xmath77 for @xmath73 , @xmath78 for @xmath72 , @xmath79 for @xmath71 , and @xmath80 for @xmath81 .",
    "the errors are dominated by the large uncertainties on the experimental @xmath38 distribution .    in view of the intrinsically slow convergence of the @xmath49 , @xmath2 ope series",
    ", it is worth testing further the nominally improved convergence of the non - spectral weight sum rules .",
    "we do so by ignoring external information on @xmath34 and performing a combined , @xmath45 fit for @xmath34 and @xmath42 , obtaining @xmath82 mev and @xmath83 .",
    "the result for @xmath34 is seen to be in excellent agreement with the average of independent sum rule and unquenched lattice determinations , already quoted above .",
    "this agreement justifies a combined @xmath45 fit with the external average , @xmath75 mev , as input .",
    "the result , @xmath84 is compatible , within mutual errors , with both the recent @xmath85 determination , @xmath86  @xcite and the recent @xmath87/\\gamma [ \\pi_{\\mu 2}]$ ] determination , @xmath88  @xcite .",
    "( [ vusmainresult ] ) represents our best determination of @xmath42 from present data .    as for future prospects ,",
    "re - running the combined non - spectral weight analysis with an assumed uncertainty of @xmath89 mev on @xmath90 and @xmath38 spectral errors reduced by a factor of @xmath91 ( a reduction expected to be readily achievable from the b - factory analyses ) , produces a total combined error @xmath92 on @xmath42 .",
    "further improvements to the theoretical component of this error are almost certainly possible , once the currently rather large @xmath38 errors above the @xmath93 are reduced , making it practical to construct , test , and work with additional weights having less strong suppressions of contributions from this part of the spectrum than do those employed above .",
    "we conclude by discussing two aspects of the current data situation which make it likely that higher central @xmath42 values will be obtained from future analyses .",
    "the first point concerns the @xmath38 data . at present , the branching fractions for observed strange decay modes go down only to the @xmath94 level ( @xmath95 of the total strange branching fraction )  @xcite . adding the contribution of any additional , as - yet - undetected strange mode will necessarily increase @xmath42 .",
    "the increase from a mode with branching fraction @xmath96 , for example , would be @xmath97 . with the b - factory experiments already reporting preliminary results for strange mode branching fractions at the few - to - several @xmath98 level  @xcite ,",
    "it is clear that such missing mode contributions will no longer be a problem once the babar and belle analyses are completed .",
    "the second point concerns the @xmath37 data . with quoted errors ,",
    "current experimental @xmath37 uncertainties produce an error of @xmath99 on @xmath42 .",
    "one should , however , bear in mind that significant discrepancies exist between the version of @xmath100 measured in @xmath1 decay and that implied by cvc and electroproduction ( em ) data , even after all known isospin - breaking corrections have been taken into account  @xcite .",
    "the discrepancies are much larger than the nominally quoted errors on the @xmath1 decay data , the direct @xmath1 measurements and em expectations for the branching fractions of the @xmath101 and @xmath102 modes differing by @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "replacing the @xmath1 @xmath105 data with the nominally equivalent em results would raise @xmath42 by @xmath106",
    ". a similar replacement of the @xmath107 data would raise it by a further @xmath108 . while at present the @xmath1 decay data is in better agreement than the em data with certain ope constraints  @xcite , there is definitely room in the @xmath1 decay data for somewhat lower @xmath37 branching fractions  @xcite , which would lead to larger @xmath42 . resolving the @xmath1",
    "versus em discrepancy is thus important for the determination of @xmath42 using hadronic @xmath1-decay - based sum rules , as well as for resolving the status of the hadronic contribution to @xmath5 in the standard model .      99 e. braaten , s. narison , a. pich , nucl . phys . *",
