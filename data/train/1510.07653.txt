    "most works in the field concentrate on states near the middle of the many body spectrum .",
    "this is necessary because the density of states varies significantly over the full spectrum ( as can be seen for example in fig .",

    "this allows us to use the full spectrum for calculating level statistics , without needing to project out any states .",
    "we note that @xcite referred to this normalization procedure as ` unfolding ' but we do not use this term here .",

    "we first compute the average density of states @xmath91 of the floquet hamiltonian over the different samples .",
    "then for each sample , we transform the floquet hamiltonian spectrum from the @xmath90 variable to the @xmath95 variable .",
    "the ratios of adjacent gaps are computed for each sample in the new variable @xmath95 @xmath96 from which we deduce the average ratio @xmath46 of adjacent gaps .",

    "some elementary algebraic manipulations allow us to rewrite the floquet operator as @xmath111 where we recall that the @xmath112 are spin half operators @xmath113 .",
    "now one can straightforwardly see that driving frequencies when @xmath114 ( integer @xmath61 ) are special , since in this case the stroboscopic time evolution operator becomes simply @xmath115 in this stroboscopic time evolution operator , every spin is decoupled , and the stroboscopic time evolution simply performs a ( different and independent ) rotation on every spin .",

    ", we look at how the density of floquet eigenphases changes as a function of driving frequency ( fig .",
    "[ supplmat : dos ] ) . at high frequency , the density of eigenphases is contained entirely within the principal floquet zone @xmath138 $ ] .",
    "we can thus ` unfold ' to an extended zone scheme with no ambiguity - the bandwidth is less than the floquet zone width , and all the eigenphases lie within the principal zone .",
    "this is the regime in which high frequency expansions converge .",
    "it was argued @xcite that in this the floquet hamiltonian is well approximated by the time averaged hamiltonian .",
    "there is full level repulsion between all eigenstates , as long as the time averaged hamiltonian is thermalizing .",
    "the width of this zone in @xmath27 should shrink to zero in the thermodynamic limit , since the bandwidth of a thermalizing system is an extensive quantity .",
    "in contrast , at low frequency ( large @xmath27 ) , the bandwidth is much greater than the floquet zone width ( the density of states is essentially uniform across the principal floquet zone ) and we can not unambiguously unfold to an extended zone scheme .",
    "this is the regime in which the floquet hamiltonian is very different from the time averaged hamiltonian , and all the eigenstates have been extensively reconstructed ( i.e. look very different to the eigenstates of the time averaged hamiltonian @xcite ) . again there is full level repulsion between all eigenstates . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", this will presumably be the only regime .",
    "the dip in @xmath50 starts when the floquet zone width first becomes of order the bandwidth ( i.e. when the eigenphases first start to wrap around the principal zone ) .",
    "this happens e.g. when @xmath139 for the model in fig.1 and fig.8(a ) , and when @xmath140 for the model in fig.2 and fig.8b .",
    "the dip ends and the low frequency regime begins when the density of eigenphases becomes uniform across the principal floquet zone i.e. when @xmath141 for the model in fig.1 and fig.8a , and around @xmath142 for the model in fig.2 and fig.8b .",
    "the dip thus happens precisely when the eigenenergies of the time averaged hamiltonian are starting to get folded back into the principal zone , but when the folding back is not yet reached the middle of the principal zone .",
    "another way to say this is that in quasienergy windows near the edges of the principal zone , states that would have lived in different zones in an extended zone scheme have been folded on top of each other , but in the center of the principal zone the only states are states that would have been there even in an extended zone scheme .",
    "now the eigenstates of the time averaged hamiltonian have level repulsion between then , but the bandwidth of the time averaged hamiltonian is larger than the floquet zone width , so the band edges of the time averaged hamiltonian get folded back into the principal floquet zone . after folding back , eigenstates of the time averaged hamiltonian that were essentially uncorrelated ( and had very different spatial structure ) end up near degenerate in quasi - energy .",
    "the true eigenstates of @xmath40 are thus massively reconstructed by resonances between eigenstates of the time averaged hamiltonian with very different spatial structure , and look completely different to the eigenstates of the time averaged hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "again , there is full level repulsion between reconstructed eigenstates ( and thus @xmath58 is governed by random matrix theory in the low frequency limit ) .    however , in the intermediate frequency regime when the dip in @xmath50 happens , _ not _ all the states have been reconstructed , since only a small fraction of the band of the time averaged hamiltonian has been folded back into the principal floquet zone . while there is full level repulsion between unreconstructed states and between reconstructed states ,",
    "there is _ not _ full level repulsion between reconstructed and unreconstructed states , which both co - exist in this intermediate frequency regime .",
    "we believe that this lack of full level repulsion between reconstructed and unreconstructed states is responsible for the intermediate frequency dip in @xmath50 , with the minimum of the dip occurring when roughly half the states have been reconstructed .",
    "this dip seems to thus be a robust and highly universal finite size effect in thermalizing floquet systems ."

    "<S> we begin by pointing out that the floquet problem can thermalize to the cue for all @xmath27 even when the instantaneous hamiltonian always thermalizes to the orthogonal class . </S>",
    "<S> this can be achieved e.g. in a model with @xmath62 the instantaneous hamiltonian only ever has a field along two axes , is thus invariant under an appropriate antiunitary transformation , and thus at weak disorder thermalizes to the orthogonal ensemble @xmath63 ( see supplementary material ) . </S>",

    "<S> we can also have a situation where the instantaneous hamiltonian is always gue but the floquet problem is coe . in a two bang model with equal length bangs , this happens if there is an antiunitary symmetry that exchanges @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in this case </S>",

    "<S> we now discuss situations where the floquet hamiltonian displays transitions between random matrix classes as a function of driving frequency . </S>",
    "<S> one model that does this has all @xmath80 and @xmath81 and @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> this has fields along all three axes so in general should be in the unitary class , but should have orthogonal statistics in the @xmath83 limit since @xmath84 has vanishing field along the @xmath85 axis . what we see numerically ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ goecoecue ] ) is however much more striking . </S>",
    "<S> there is a finite regime of frequencies @xmath86 over which we observe orthogonal statistics , with unitary statistics not setting in until @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> if the dip in @xmath50 is identified with the onset of folding states into the principal floquet zone , then the ` orthogonal regime ' is presumably the regime when the bandwidth is less than the floquet zone width . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency window over which this is true should shrink to zero in the thermodynamic limit , since the bandwidth of an interacting system is an extensive quantity . </S>",
    "<S> however , the shrinking of the size of this window with system size is extremely slow ( fig.4 ) , and thus an appreciable ` orthogonal regime ' may be seen in modest sized systems . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that resonances between floquet states in different zones ( in an extended zone scheme ) are apparently essential to drive this @xmath40 from the orthogonal to the unitary class .     and @xmath81 and @xmath82 , for systems of @xmath0 spins . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath50 has been averaged over 200 samples . ]    _ conclusions : _ our numerical investigation of floquet thermalization in the orthogonal and unitary symmetry classes reveals the following general principles : ( i ) the floquet problem can thermalize , displaying random matrix statistics , even when the instantaneous hamiltonian is always integrable , if the instantaneous constants of motion change over time . in this case the floquet problem can display anomalous integrable behavior when the driving frequency is commensurate with characteristic energy scales in the instantaneous integrable hamiltonians.(ii ) a thermalizing instantaneous hamiltonian @xmath88 will be governed by the orthogonal ensemble iff it is invariant under an anti - unitary symmetry transformation @xmath89 . however , even if the instantaneous hamiltonian is always governed by the orthogonal ensemble , the floquet problem can be in the unitary class iff the instantaneous antiunitary @xmath89 changes as a function of time . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) the floquet problem can be in the orthogonal class even if the instantenous hamiltonian is in the unitary class , if there exists an antiunitary transformation which leaves the floquet operator unchanged up to a shift in the origin of time . </S>",
    "<S> ( in a two bang model this happens if the antiunitary transformation exchanges @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( iv ) there can arise crossovers between orthogonal and unitary thermalization as a function of driving frequency . </S>",
    "<S> our results apply to the entire spectrum , not just the states in the middle of the band . </S>",
