    "semiclassical transport - simulations have provided the theoretical backbone for interpreting heavy - ion reactions at energies in excess of few tens of mev per nucleon .",
    "simulations follow either a  cascade approach@xcite or a  solution to the boltzmann equation including the mean field and the pauli principle@xcite . within these approaches",
    "particles move classically in - between collisions where momenta change abruptly and possibly new particles form . in  practice ,",
    "the pauli principle appeared primarily important for reactions below 150  mev / nucleon . for beam energies of hundreds of mev per nucleon",
    ", detailed comparisons of simulations with data have been carried out@xcite in order to determine features of the momentum and density dependence of the nuclear mean field . within many - body theory ,",
    "efforts were made to calculate nuclear optical potentials starting from elementary nn interactions@xcite . in  describing reactions up to the beam energies",
    "@xmath12  gev / nucleon , pions and low - lying resonances have also been included in simulations .",
    "it has been noted that results of heavy - ion reaction simulations can depend sensitively on prescriptions of space - time details of elementary scattering processes@xcite .",
    "such details of elementary processes may matter even more at higher beam energies than at those of the msu or sis accelerators , specifically , at those of ags ( 14  gev / nucleon ) , sps ( 200  gev / nucleon ) , and of the constructed and planned colliders , rhic and lhc .",
    "this is because of high lorentz dilation factors that can amplify space - time effects , and because of high particle densities early in the reactions .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the time duration of elementary processes in free space , in  the context of semiclassical simulations .",
    "both the forward - going and scattered waves get delayed in elementary processes . while delay of the forward wave is consistent with effects of an  optical potential on a  particle in a  medium , to  the lowest order in particle density ,",
    "both types of delay times , of the forward and scattered waves , affect the density of states in energy , to  the lowest nontrivial second - order in particle density .",
    "as  one important outcome of our work , we find that , to describe the density of states and associated thermodynamic quantities such as pressure , heat capacity , etc . , the delays for scattered particles must be properly accounted for in semiclassical simulations , in  addition to the effects of the optical potential .",
    "if one relaxes the requirements on interactions in simulations , forsaking e.g.  the proper behavior of single - particle energies , but demanding that free energy as a  fundamental thermodynamic function , is properly reproduced to within the second order in density in equilibrium , then one can manipulate the mean field to entirely absorb effects of the delays for scattered particles .",
    "alternatively , time delays for scattered particles may be manipulated to absorb the effects of optical potential . even in a  degenerate fermi gas ,",
    "as we show , the delays in scattering can affect thermodynamic quantities .",
    "we  investigate several examples of particle - particle scattering amplitudes describing , respectively , the scattering through a  sharp breit - wigner resonance , the  @xmath2 interaction in the @xmath3 channel , and the @xmath0-channel scattering of massless partons . using free - space amplitudes , we calculate numerically the time delays for the @xmath4 system . we  show that the delay for scattering has some dependence on the scattering angle .",
    "the  delays become small at high energies . finally , we investigate scattering schemes in simulations@xcite in the context of time delays .",
    "the  schemes include hard - sphere scattering and scattering at the distance of closest approach .",
    "we  outline numerical strategies for determining the equations of state and transport coefficients to an  arbitrary order in density given the scattering prescription .",
    "the content of subsequent sections is as follows . in  sec .",
    "[ time ] we consider a  wave packet traversing a  region with a  scatterer and derive expressions for the delays of scattered and forward - going waves , in  terms of scattering amplitudes ( phase shifts ) and their derivatives . in  sec .",
    "[ ergo ] we demonstrate that these delay times are consistent with an  ergodic constraint stating that the extra time spent in the vicinity of a  scatterer should be proportional to the change in the density of states brought about by that scatterer .",
    "we  further show that the delay time for a  forward - going wave corresponds to the classical motion of a  particle in a  mean field given by the self - energy for a  plane wave in a  low - density medium .",
    "we  also discuss in that section and more in the appendix , in  the context of ergodic constraints , the  modification of the scattering of two bodies brought about by the presence of a  third body .",

    "we consider a  wave packet incident on a  large spherical volume of radius @xmath5 , at the center of which interaction takes place . to  make the derivation simpler",

    "the  time in  ( [ avtim ] ) is represented as the average time for the particle to leave the volume minus the average time for the particle to enter the volume , as @xmath25 is positive when a particle exits and negative when a  particle enters .",
    "we decompose @xmath26 into incoming and outgoing pieces and , as there is no interference between incoming and outgoing waves for a  large volume , we write explicitly @xmath27 with the incoming wave having only a  contribution from the unscattered wave packet , one finds , from ( [ inci ] ) and ( [ avtim ] ) , that @xmath28",

    "one needs to find the correction to the density of states of relative motion .",
    "this correction to the density of states @xmath58 is given by phase shifts for two - particle scattering@xcite , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the reduced relative momentum , @xmath61 is the volume , and @xmath62 is the velocity of relative motion .",

    "if  processes such as @xmath63 can occur , a  similar answer can be obtained by diagonalizing the s - matrix and finding the eigenphases@xcite .    in a  simulation ,",
    "the equations of motion should result in a  change in the probability for two particles of a  specific energy to be in the vicinity of each other , proportional to the change in the density of states for these particles .",

    "given that particles spend a  portion of time @xmath65 within @xmath61 in the absence of interactions , when sampling is carried out over a long time @xmath66 , then , in  the presence of interactions , the time within @xmath61 should change by  @xmath67 such that @xmath68 this can be thought of as an  ergodic constraint , since a  system continuously sampled over a  long time should be populated according to its contribution to the density of states . in  this section",
    "we explore the case of elastic scattering and wish to see if the results of the preceeding section are consistent with the ergodic constraint and with the picture of particles moving through a  mean field .    in the context of a  classical simulation ,",
    "the additional time @xmath67 will come from three causes .",
    "first , particle kinetic energy within the volume @xmath61 will be different as compared to free space , by the negative of the mean potential within the volume , @xmath69 .",
    "the  change in the energy gives a  change in the momentum and in the velocity and , in  consequence , in  the time spent within subvolume by an  amount denoted @xmath70 . in  addition",
    ", the energy dependence of the mean potential generally changes the velocity by @xmath71 .",
    "the  corresponding change in the time spent within the volume is denoted as @xmath72 .",
    "both these contributions to the time follow from classical equations of motion within a  potential .",
    "a  third contribution @xmath73 stems from collisions .",
    "because of collisions the particles will emerge on the average earlier or later ( particularly in the case of resonance scattering ) from the volume than in absence of collisions .",
    "summing the three contributions should yield @xmath74    the time @xmath75 can be easily obtained from the ergodic theorem for a  _ classical _ potential .",
    "otherwise , one can resort to geometric considerations caring , however , for the fact that , to  the lowest order in @xmath76 , the velocity changes its direction as well as the magnitude . as the relative change in time spent within the subvolume should be proportional to the relative change in the density of states brought about by the change in kinetic energy ,",
    "we get @xmath77 the contribution @xmath72 is obtained by noting that the time it takes to traverse a  given path through the subvolume is proportional to the inverse of velocity , @xmath78 the contribution due to collisions , @xmath73 , will be determined by the collision rate and the change  @xmath79 in the average time spent within the collision range compared to free flight time , @xmath80 combining the expressions for different contributions to the change in time on account of interactions , we  find that , according to the ergodic constraint , we  should have @xmath81    in the following we shall express  @xmath76 in terms of phase shifts and then determine  @xmath82 from  ( [ erg2 ] ) and examine whether the result is consistent with what was obtained in preceeding section .",
    "the  potential @xmath76 in  ( [ erg2 ] ) is identified with the correction to the kinetic energy at which the single - particle green s function has a  pole , @xmath83 where we use the fact that self - energy can be expressed in terms of the forward element of the @xmath84-matrix and where @xmath60 continues to be the relative particle momentum . assuming",
    "that angular momentum is conserved , we  obtain @xmath85 the imaginary part of the matrix times  @xmath86 can be shown to be equal to @xmath87 by using the standard expression for the cross section involving @xmath88 .",
    "then @xmath22 is indeed the geometric scattering rate one expects .",
    "turning now to the real part of @xmath84-matrix , the potential associated with the presence of other particle within subvolume becomes @xmath89    the sum of the times @xmath90 and @xmath91 in  ( [ erg2 ] ) involves the derivative @xmath92 . with ( [ udef ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath93 upon inserting the above result into eq .",
    "( [ erg2 ] ) we find @xmath94 if only one partial wave is scattered , then the change in time reduces to @xmath95 this result is consistent with eq .",
    "( [ taus ] ) of the last section .",
    "if  many waves are scattered , then there is generally interference between various scattered partial waves giving rise to a  variation of the change in time with scattering angle , cf .",
    "( [ taust ] ) .",
    "equation  ( [ tauda ] ) represents , in  such a  case , an  average of the change of time over the scattering angles , weighted with the flux or cross section .",
    "one can further see that the time delay of the forward wave , as derived in the last section , may be identified with @xmath96 .",
    "the wave packet in the last section was of a  transverse size  @xmath97 .",
    "we  further assume that the length of the packet is  @xmath98 .",
    "the  time for such a  packet to move by the potential in the absence of interactions is  @xmath99 .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ tauf ] ) in the limit of large  @xmath100 we obtain @xmath101 for wide packets we can approximate @xmath102 and , with the volume of a  packet being equal to  @xmath103 , we  can rewrite  ( [ deltaf ] )  as @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the density of states inside @xmath61 .",
    "one can see that this agrees with ( [ clasum ] ) .",
    "given a  uniform many - body system , with density @xmath106 and temperature @xmath66 treated as independent variables , all intensive thermodynamic quantitates can be obtained from the free energy per unit volume @xmath107 . in  terms of the correction to the density of states of relative motion in energy in ( [ rhoe ] ) , the free energy @xmath107 , to  the second order in the density , can be written  as @xmath108 where @xmath109 is free energy for a  noninteracting system and @xmath110 is the correction to pressure@xcite @xmath111 and where the effects of statistics are ignored .",
    "it can verified by a  direct calculation that the correction to pressure may be further expressed as @xmath112 here @xmath113 is phase - space occupancy .",
    "the  first term on the r.h.s .  of  ( [ deltap ] ) accounts for the forward time delay or mean field .",
    "the  second term accounts for delay in scattering and , depending on the sign of  @xmath79 , allows further for an  interpretation in terms of the reduction in the number of degrees of freedom or in terms of excluded volume .",
    "two important conclusions can be reached regarding the method of the previous section .",
    "first , the sum of time delays for scattered and forward - going waves is consistent with ergodic constraints .",
    "secondly , the time delay of the forward - going wave is consistent with motion of a  particle through a  mean field .",
    "however , this consistency was derived assuming that the size of the region used to determine the densities was large",
    ". the  limitations of this approximation are discussed below .",
    "a problem with incorporating a  mean field which depends on the number of particles within a  given volume element , is that such field can result in classically bound states for attractive potentials , or inpenetrable potential barriers for repulsive potentials .",
    "considerations in this section required that the potential @xmath114 was much smaller than any characteristic energy .",
    "this is necessary for @xmath115 .",
    "for a  sufficiently large volume @xmath61 this is not a  problem .",
    "however , for a  finite @xmath61 there exists phase space that is either bound ( attractive potentials ) or unavailable ( repulsive potentials ) , of a  magnitude @xmath116 on using @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is scattering length , for low @xmath60 in the expression for optical potential ( [ udef ] ) , one finds that @xmath119 thus one finds that for a  _ strict _ validity of our considerations the volume @xmath61 containing a  single scatterer must be chosen large compared to the scattering length . on examining eq .",
    "( [ tauf ] ) from the previous section , one finds that , in  the first place , such a  condition must be satisfied to allow for a  proper definition of @xmath120 .",
    "scattering lengths are of the order of the interaction range , unless a  resonance or bound state exist close to the threshold .",
    "unfortunately , this is precisely the case for nucleon - nucleon scattering near threshold where scattering lengths approach 20  fm .",
    "when considering the interaction of two particles in secs .  [ time ] and  [ erg ] , we  neglected the probability that a  third body could interact with any of the two particles within the subvolume used to define the mean field . in  eq .",
    "( [ ergcl ] ) the contributions to the extra time spent within the subvolume , @xmath121 and @xmath122 , arose because the particle trajectories were modified by the mean field .",
    "the  first contribution arose because the kinetic energy and direction were altered on  entering the mean field .",
    "the  second contribution arose due to dependence of the mean field on  momentum that led to the change of velocity by  @xmath123 .",
    "when many scatterings occur , the  time spent in a  given relative state does not just depend on  trajectories and velocity , but  further on the manner in which such state is populated and depopulated .",
    "if  population of different states is to be consistent with first two of the time delays in  eq .",
    "( [ ergcl ] ) due to interactions , the  scattering prescriptions need to be modified in the presence of third bodies .",
    "transition rates per unit time from an  initial state , are given though , generally , by  a  transition matrix element to a  final state squared multiplied by the final - state density in energy . for  example , in  the case of particles  1 and  3 scattering in the presence of particle  2 , the  final - state density would be obtained from a  product of single - particle densities for  1 and  3 .",
    "latter densities , up to a  factor , are identical with imaginary parts of single - particle green s functions  ( [ gf ] ) . when shifting the single - particle energies by mean fields generally dependent on relative momenta of  1 and  2 , and  3 and  2 , one precisely accounts for the change in the density of relative states , in  feeding of the states . besides the change of relative momenta due to mean field , that corresponds to  @xmath124 , the  levels of  1 and  2 or  3 and  2 are pulled apart or pushed together",
    "when mean field is energy - dependent , changing the density , what corresponds to  @xmath125 .",
    "then the rates calculated with single - particle energies in the final density of states , would yield population of states consistent with these first two times in  eq .",
    "( [ ergcl ] ) , if  the particles could leave these states during the whole time such as obtained with an  inclusion of the forward time delay or simply adoption of mean field .",
    "ergodicity when many scatterings occur is discussed in more detail in the  appendix , together with the single - particle spectral densities .",
    "we  show there , that , in  fact , population of different states could be made consistent with an  ergodic constraint involving all three delay times in  ( [ ergcl ] ) , i.e.  also the  scattering delay , if  one included in the green s function  ( [ gf ] ) the imaginary part of the @xmath84-matrix and allowed for a  separate dependence of the matrix on  energy and relative momentum .",
    "modification of the scattering or transition rates in terms of such complete spectral functions , nonetheless , might not be practical except for fully equilibrium situations .",
    "also , it  needs to  be stated that a  modification of the final - state density for two particles such as  1 and  3 on account of scattering with third particle , _ independent _ of a  modification of matrix element for  1 and  3 , might not be proper .",
    "with regard to scattering , correlations could be important , persisting throughout the interaction process .",
    "it will be seen in the examples of secs .",
    "[ res ] and  [ nnscat ] that the contribution to the density of states from the mean field alone can be very significant .",
    "if  scattering is then done in the presence of strong mean fields , it  is important that matrix elements get modified  too . in  case of momentum - independent mean fields ,",
    "this just amounts to the calculation of scattering rates in terms of kinetic particle energies only .",
    "situation can be more cumbersome in case of momentum - dependent fields as one generally loses the convenience of working in the rest frame of scattering particles . a  particularly strong momentum - dependence of the mean field results for pions in nuclear matter due the  derivative coupling to nucleons@xcite .",
    "rates and scattering prescriptions may be complicated when the time delay is negative . in  such a  case",
    "the prescription may effectively exclude a  relative volume , e.g.  an  energy - dependent hard core .",
    "one  may not want to fill the excluded phase - space volume in the scattering with a  third body and with this populate relative states following ergodic theorem including the scattering delay time .",
    "scattering prescriptions are investigated in sec .",
    "[ simu ] , including one with a  hard core prescription and one where effective time delays are generated by correlating the outgoing scattering angle with the impact parameter .",
    "if one solely aims at satisfying the ergodic constraint , and thus properly reproducing thermodynamic properties of a  system , while ignoring the physical differences behind the mean field or forward time delay and the delays for scattered waves , then one can absorb all interaction effects , in  the lowest nontrivial order in density , exclusively into the mean field  or , alternatively , into the delays for scattered particles .",
    "we  shall illustrate our points by considering the correction to the pressure in  ( [ presde ] ) and  ( [ deltap ] ) .",
    "thus , from ( [ delt ] ) , ( [ udef ] ) and  ( [ clasum ] ) , it follows that the density of two - particle states in energy would be properly reproduced when ignoring the delays for scattered waves and , in  place of the mean field @xmath76 in the center expression in  ( [ udef ] ) , using a  field @xmath126 given by  ( [ udef ] ) with @xmath127 replaced by  @xmath128 .",
    "as  far as the correction to the pressure is concerned , this corresponds to rewriting the expression ( [ deltap ] ) as @xmath129 where @xmath130 the replacement of the sine by its argument in the field is actually a  good approximation when the phase shifts are low compared to @xmath131 .",
    "the general conclusion then is that the delays for scattered waves are relatively unimportant for the thermodynamic properties when the phase shifts are low , no matter what are the values of these delays .",
    "if the mean field were to be ignored , then , in  order to properly reproduce the density of two - particle states , from ( [ delt ] ) and ( [ tauc ] ) , the mean delay time for scattering should be taken equal to @xmath132 and for scattering in only one partial wave @xmath133 in place of  ( [ tauda ] ) .",
    "the correction to the pressure ( [ deltap ] ) is then rewritten as @xmath134 some advantage of an  approach with delays put into scattering is that particles move with uniform velocities .",
    "one  problem , though , is  that the delay times  @xmath135 diverge at thresholds , where phase shifts go to zero linearly in the momentum with the coefficient of proportionality being equal to the negative of scattering length . in  sec .",
    "[ res ] we shall discuss resonance scattering including , of interest for heavy - ion collisions , pion - nucleon scattering , and in that context discuss more the different possible prescriptions for time delays .",
    "now  we turn to to the role of  statistics .",
    "for any finite energy the density of states in energy is increases by symmetrization and decreased by antisymmetrization .",
    "corrections to thermodynamic quantities , such as the free energy density or pressure , arise within the second order in density even in the absence of interactions .",
    "symmetrization also affects scattering processes both in that the outgoing states may be pauli - blocked or bose - enhanced and in that the scattering amplitude may be internally modified@xcite . in  the following , we  consider pressure in an  equilibrated many - body system in terms of the @xmath39-matrix . in  a nonequilibrium system , for low scattering rates , the  @xmath84-matrix approximation@xcite in the single - particle equations of motion leads to the boltzmann equation with rates corresponding to two - particle collisions , enhanced or reduced on account of statistics of final states and with medium - modified amplitudes .",
    "we  assess implications for time delays and scattering processes in  simulations , following from ergodicity .",

    "since an  @xmath0-channel scattering involves an  intermediate state very far from being on - shell , the questions involving the time delay for such a  process may not be so crucial since these processes are rather rapid . of  a  greater concern is the formation of partons through bremsstrahlung involving intermediate states which are nearly on - shell .",

    "an  equivalent formulation of the ergodic theorem  ( [ dtaun ] ) is that for any two states  @xmath303 and  @xmath304 : @xmath305 for simplification , we  next assume that  2 is much heavier than  1 , whereupon we can make no distinction between relative states of  1 and  2 and single - particle states  of  1 .",
    "equation  ( [ tau / n ] ) then may be also written  as @xmath306    we are now set to address the  scattering of a  particle  3 , representing remainder of the system , with particle  1 , in  the presence of  2 .",
