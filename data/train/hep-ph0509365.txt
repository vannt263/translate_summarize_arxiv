    "in the classical quark model invented 40 years ago , a baryon is composed of three quarks .",
    "the simple 3q constituent quark model has been very successful in explaining the static properties , such as mass and magnetic moment , of the ground states of the flavor su(3 ) octet and decuplet baryons .",
    "however , with advent of the qcd in 1973 and later electron - proton deep inelastic scattering experiments , we know that besides the three valence quarks in the proton there are many other partons including quark - antiquark pairs and gluons .    before 1990 , in all global analyses of parton distribution in nucleons , a symmetric light - quark ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) sea was assumed , based on the usual assumption that the sea of quark - antiquark pairs is produced perturbatively from gluon splitting @xcite . however , a surprisingly large asymmetry between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 sea quark distributions in the proton has been observed in more recent deep inelastic scattering @xcite and drell - yan experiments @xcite .",
    "there have been many theoretical attempts @xcite trying to find the origins for this asymmetry .",
    "it is believed @xcite that the asymmetry can not be produced from perturbative qcd and mesonic degrees of freedom play an important role for the effect . in the popular meson - cloud model @xcite , the excess of @xmath5 over @xmath4 in the proton",
    "is explained by a mixture of @xmath6 with the @xmath7 composed of @xmath8 . on the other hand ,",
    "the excess of @xmath5 over @xmath4 can be also explained by a simple statistical model @xcite by taking proton as an ensemble of quark - gluon fock states and using the principle of detailed balance for transitions between various fock states through creation or annihilation of partons . the basic idea in ref.@xcite is rather simple :",
    "while sea quark - antiquark pairs are produced flavor blindly by gluon splitting , @xmath4 quarks have larger probability to annihilate than @xmath5 quarks due to the fact that there are more u quarks than d quarks in the proton , which hence causes the asymmetry .    to understand the multi - quark components of the nucleon , the strangeness in the proton is of particular interest , because it definitely comes from the multi - quark part . in the next section ,",
    "we give a brief review of some recent progress on this aspect and a simple model - prediction for the strangeness magnetic moment @xmath0 of the proton . in section 3 , we discuss how the inclusion of penta - quark components can explain the longstanding mass - reverse problem of @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xmath3 resonances and some relevant properties .",
    "finally we give conclusions in section 4 .",
    "several measurements including the @xmath9 @xmath10-term , neutrino - induced charm production and polarization effects in electron - nucleon deep - inelastic scattering indicate that there may be significant @xmath11 component in the proton @xcite .",
    "recently four experiments on parity violation in electron - proton scattering suggest that the strangeness magnetic moment of the proton @xmath0 is positive @xcite .",
    "this is in contradiction with most theoretical calculations .",
    "the meson - cloud calculations @xcite with a fluctuation of the proton into a kaon and a strange hyperon lead to a negative value for the strangeness magnetic moment @xmath0 . the statistical model @xcite gives a zero value for the @xmath0 .",
    "various lattice qcd calculations give various values for @xmath0 : @xmath12 @xcite , @xmath13 @xcite , @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "very recently , a complete analysis @xcite of the relation between the @xmath0 and the possible configurations of the @xmath15 component of the proton concludes that for a positive @xmath0 value the @xmath16 is in the ground state and the @xmath17 system in the @xmath18-state .",
    "the conventional @xmath19 configuration has the @xmath16 mainly in @xmath18-state and hence leads to a negative @xmath0 value .",
    "the hidden strangeness analogues of recently proposed diquark cluster models @xcite for the @xmath20 pentaquark have @xmath16 in the ground state and the @xmath17 system in the @xmath18-state , hence give a positive @xmath0 value .",
    "the analysis suggests that the @xmath21 components in baryons may be mainly in colored quark cluster configurations rather than in the conventional `` meson cloud '' configurations .    in order to explain the observed excess of @xmath5 over @xmath4 and the non - zero @xmath11 contributions , the minimal model - wave - function for the proton should be @xmath22[ud]\\bar d",
    "> + \\epsilon_2    @xmath23 , @xmath24 $ ] and @xmath25 $ ] are scalar diquarks as in jaffe - wilczek diquark model @xcite .",
    "in order to reproduce the experimental measured values @xmath26 @xcite and @xmath27 @xcite , we have @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "note here @xmath30 which is smaller than the corresponding su(3 ) symmetry value 1/2 @xcite due to heavier @xmath31 quark mass than @xmath32 , @xmath33 quarks .",
    "for this simple model - wave - function , the probability of the @xmath11 component is @xmath34 , and the corresponding strangeness magnetic moment @xmath0 can be calculated as @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are diquark masses for @xmath24 $ ] and @xmath25 $ ] , respectively .",
    "taking @xmath38mev , @xmath39mev , @xmath40mev and @xmath41mev as in ref.@xcite , we have a prediction @xmath42 .",
    "since we have assumed zero @xmath43 component in the simple model - wave - function , the value should be regarded as the lower limit for the @xmath0 . for @xmath44 the result of the sample experiment @xcite is @xmath45 .",
    "more precise measurement of the @xmath0 are crucial for finally pinning down the multi - quark components in the proton .",
    "from the study of the proton , we know that the probability of multi - quark components in the proton are larger than 15%",
    ". then for the excited nucleon states , @xmath3 resonances , there should be more multi - quark components . to understand the properties of the @xmath3 resonances , it is absolutely necessary to consider these multi - quark components .",
    "a long - standing problem in conventional @xmath46 constituent quark models is to explain the mass reverse of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xmath3 resonances .    recently from bes results on @xmath47 @xcite and @xmath48 @xcite , the ratio between effective coupling constants of @xmath1 to @xmath49 and @xmath50",
    "is deduced to be @xmath51 @xcite . with previous known value of @xmath52 ,",
    "the obtained new value of @xmath53 is shown to reproduce recent @xmath54 near - threshold cross section data as well .",
    "taking into account this large @xmath55 coupling in the coupled channel breit - wigner formula for the @xmath1 , its breit - wigner mass is found to be around 1400 mev , much smaller than previous value of about 1535 mev obtained without including its coupling to @xmath49 .",
    "the nearly degenerate mass for the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 @xmath3 resonances can be easily understood by considering multi - quark components in them",
    ". the @xmath56 could be the lowest @xmath57 orbital excited @xmath58 state with a large admixture of @xmath59[us]\\bar s>$ ] pentaquark component having @xmath24 $ ] , @xmath25 $ ] and @xmath16 in the ground state .",
    "the @xmath60 could be the lowest radial excited @xmath58 state with a large admixture of @xmath59[ud]\\bar d>$ ] pentaquark component having two @xmath24 $ ] diquarks in the relative p - wave .",
    "while the lowest @xmath57 orbital excited @xmath58 state should have a mass lower than the lowest radial excited @xmath58 state , the @xmath59[us]\\bar s>$ ] pentaquark component has a higher mass than @xmath59[ud]\\bar d>$ ] pentaquark component .",
    "the large mixture of the @xmath59[us]\\bar s>$ ] pentaquark component in the @xmath61 may also explain naturally its large coupling to the final states with strangeness .",
    "the probability of multi - quark components in the proton is at least 15% .",
    "the empirical indications for a positive strangeness magnetic moment @xmath0 of the proton suggest the multi - quark components in baryons to be mainly in colored quark cluster configurations rather than in `` meson cloud '' configurations or in the form of a sea of quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "the @xmath0 of the proton is predicted to be no less than 4.3% of the total magnetic moment of the proton .",
    "the colored quark cluster multi - quark picture gives a natural explanation of the longstanding mass - reverse problem of @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xmath3 resonances , and the large coupling of the @xmath1 to the channels with strangeness .",
