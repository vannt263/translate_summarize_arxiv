    ", we compare one of the simplest models of generalized hydrodynamics to the results of state of the art numerical simulations for @xmath0 .",
    "we show that the model works remarkably well for all @xmath4 values , i.e. the model describes both the conventional hydrodynamic limit at small @xmath4 values and the large @xmath4 behaviour ( when the ions behave as a collection of free particles ) , along with the entire intermediate dynamics between these two regimes .",

    "we consider a plasma consisting of one species of ions of charge @xmath5 and mass @xmath6 at temperature @xmath7 and density @xmath8 . because the ions are much more massive than the electrons , on the time scale of the ion dynamics of interest here",

    "we take the yukawa potential , @xmath9 to represent the screened interaction between ions .",
    "the electronic screening length @xmath3 @xcite reduces to either the debye - huckel law or the thomas - fermi distance in the limiting cases of classical and degenerate electron fluid respectively @xcite .",

    "[ bigplot ] , the dependence on @xmath79 of the ion - acoustic peak position is almost identical for a large range of @xmath13 values ( i.e. @xmath108 ) .",
    "the peak width and height do show more discernible differences for these @xmath13 values . at smaller @xmath13 values ( @xmath109,@xmath15 and @xmath16 ) ,",
    "the differences in the position , width and height of the peak are greater .    at constant @xmath13 ( right panels of fig .",
    "[ bigplot ] ) , the peak position is rather different for @xmath72,@xmath14 and @xmath77 . in this case , the width and height are more similar , particularly for @xmath72 and @xmath74 .",
    "we expect that a given experiment will be able to determine peak position , width and height at a specific wavenumber ( determined by the scattering angle and x - ray wavelength @xcite ) .",

    ", our discussion in this section assumes that a real physical plasma at a certain density , temperature and ( average ) ionization state can be described by the yukawa system . while in principle this mapping could be attempted for any given values of these plasma parameters , our main interest at present concerns the dense ( approximately solid density ) , liquid - like plasmas at temperatures of @xmath110 that can be created in high power laser experiments @xcite .",
    "recently , a method for mapping the physical parameters of these states to the yukawa model ( i.e. determination of @xmath13 and @xmath21 ) has been suggested @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect that the results we have obtained for the yukawa system are certainly relevant for future experiments that will measure ion dynamics of these extreme states of matter .",
    "the gaussian memory function model is an extremely good representation of the dynamical structure factor @xmath0 of the yukawa system for a wide range of thermodynamic conditions .",
    "the model very accurately reproduces the spectrum of @xmath0 from md in terms of just 3 parameters and , as such , it is a useful way of accurately condensing or representing such data .",
    "this conclusion was only possible because of the highly accurate md data presented in this paper .",
    "the model can be used by fitting either a single parameter or three parameters to the spectrum of @xmath0 at a particular @xmath4 value ; in the latter case , the small numerical inaccuracies that arise in the md simulations can be accounted for .",
    "why exactly this form of memory function should work so well is an interesting question that certainly merits further investigation .",
    "other memory function models , such as the viscoelastic model ( an exponential memory function ) do not compare well to the md data for a wide range of @xmath4 values .",
    "it is possible that the reason a faster decaying ( compared to exponential ) gaussian works well is related to the chaotic nature of classical systems - this is reflected in the relatively short ` memory ' of the system .    since the yukawa system can describe ion - ion interactions in a plasma , our results are applicable to future x - ray scattering experiments that will attempt to measure ion dynamics in dense plasmas @xcite . in particular , our md results for the position , width and height of the ion - acoustic peak could be used to infer the thermodynamic conditions of dense plasmas",
