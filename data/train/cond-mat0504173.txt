    "in the past decades , surface effects near a phase transition have been investigated extensively , and many results have been obtained by means of mean - field theory , series expansions , renormalization and field - theoretic analyses . for reviews , see e.g. refs .  , and",
    "for more recent work see refs .  .",
    "in particular , at a second - order phase transition , where long - range correlations emerge , surface effects can be significant .",
    "the surfaces display critical phenomena which differ from the bulk critical behavior ; several surface universality classes can exist for one bulk universality class .",
    "we shall refer to the various types of transitions using the terminology of ref .  .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate surface critical phenomena in three - dimensional o@xmath0 models , namely the ising @xmath19 , the @xmath4 @xmath20 , and the heisenberg @xmath21 model .",
    "the reduced hamiltonian of these models can be written as the sum of two parts : a bulk term proportional to the volume of the system and a surface term proportional to the surface area , i.e. , @xmath22 where the dynamic variable @xmath23 is a unit vector of @xmath24 components .",
    "the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath10 are the strenghts of the coupling between nearest - neighbor sites in the bulk and on the surface layers , respectively , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 represent the reduced magnetic fields . the first two sums in eq .",
    "( [ ham1 ] ) account for the bulk and the last two sums involve the spins on the open surfaces . for ferromagnetic bulk and surface couplings ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) ,",
    "the phase transitions are sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] for the case of the ising and the @xmath4 model . in the high - temperature region ,",
    "i.e. , for bulk coupling @xmath30 , the bulk is in the paramagnetic state , so that the bulk correlation length remains finite .",
    "however , a phase transition can still occur on the open surface when the surface coupling @xmath10 is sufficiently enhanced .",
    "this phase transition is referred to as the `` surface transition , '' and is represented by the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .    10.0 cm    these phase transitions",
    "are generally thought to be in the same universality classes as the two - dimensional ising and the @xmath4 model , respectively . at the bulk critical point @xmath31",
    ", the line of surface phase transitions terminates at a point @xmath32 . at this point , both the surface and the bulk correlation length diverge .",
    "thus , the point @xmath32 acts as a multicritical point , and the phase transition is referred to as the `` special transition . '' for @xmath33 , the bulk and the surfaces simultaneously undergo a phase transition at @xmath31 . in this case , the critical correlations on the surfaces arise from the diverging bulk correlation lengths , and the transition is named the `` ordinary transition . ''",
    "the ordinary transition remains within the same universality class for a wide range of surface couplings .",
    "the correlation functions on and near the surface appear to fit universal profiles@xcite .",
    "the transitions at @xmath31 for @xmath34 are referred to as the `` extraordinary transitions . '' for the ising model , since the surfaces are already in the ferromagnetic state for a smaller coupling @xmath30 , no surface transition occurs when the bulk critical line @xmath31 is crossed . nevertheless , owing to the diverging bulk correlation length , the surfaces still display critical correlations at @xmath31 . for the @xmath4 model ,",
    "however , the surface transitions for @xmath30 are kosterlitz - thouless - like  @xcite , i.e. , the surfaces do not display long - range order for @xmath30 , in agreement with results of landau and co - workers  @xcite .    for three - dimensional o@xmath0 models with @xmath35 , which include the heisenberg model , the line of surface transitions for @xmath30 does not exist ; it may thus seem self - evident that the special and the extraordinary transitions are also absent .",
    "however , this remains to be investigated ; for instance , in two - dimensional tricritical potts models , a line of edge transitions is absent , but special and extraordinary transitions do exist @xcite .",
    "thus , even without a line of surface transitions for @xmath30 , rich surface critical phenomena can still occur in the three - dimensional heisenberg model .",
    "for instance , it was reported  @xcite that at bulk criticality @xmath31 the surface magnetic exponents depend on the ratio @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "this brings up the question whether    additional surface critical phenomena can occur for the ising model , if the surface and/or the bulk couplings are allowed to be antiferromagnetic .",
    "further , one can allow the spins on the surface to vanish , such that the surface part of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ ham1 ] ) is described by the so - called blume - capel model .",
    "such spin-0 states act as annealed vacancies on the surfaces .",
    "it was observed  @xcite that , by varying the fugacity of the vacancies , one can reach a point where the bulk ising criticality @xmath31 joins the line of surface transitions that belongs to the universality class of the two - dimensional tricritical ising model .",
    "this point was named  @xcite the `` tricritical special '' phase transition . in short , for each bulk universality class , surface transitions in various surface universality classes can occur , including the ordinary , special , and extraordinary transitions at @xmath31 , and the surface transitions at @xmath30 .",
    "apart from the bulk renormalization exponents , additional surface exponents are needed to describe the above surface critical behavior . at the ordinary and the extraordinary transitions , the surface magnetic scaling field is relevant , while the surface thermal field is irrelevant . at the special transition , both the magnetic and the thermal surface fields are relevant .    since exact information about critical behavior is scarce in three dimensions , determinations of these surface critical exponents",
    "rely on approximations of various kinds .",
    "these include mean - field theory  @xcite , series expansions  @xcite , renormalization group technique  @xcite , monte carlo simulations  @xcite , etc .",
    "the surface critical index @xmath38 is defined so as to describe the asymptotic scaling behavior of the surface magnetization @xmath39 as a function of the bulk thermal field @xmath40 , i.e. , @xmath41 . from the scaling relations it follows that this exponent is related to the critical exponents as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the bulk thermal and the surface magnetic exponent , respectively , and @xmath45 is the spatial dimensionality .",
    "the mean - field analysis and the gaussian fixed point of the @xmath46 theory yield the magnetic surface index @xmath38 as @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 respectively for the ordinary , special , and extraordinary transition .",
    "many numerical results also exist . for the simple - cubic lattice",
    ", the special transition of the ising model was located as @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "although the values of critical couplings @xmath51 and @xmath52 are far from the mean - field predictions , the above result for @xmath53 is in agreement with the mean - field value @xmath54 .",
    "further , the surface critical exponents are determined  @xcite as @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "compared to the ising model , there are fewer investigations for the three - dimensional @xmath4 and the heisenberg model . in particular , to our knowledge , numerical determinations of the special transition and",
    "the corresponding surface critical exponents have not yet been reported for the @xmath4 model .",
    "most of the existing results for the ising , the @xmath4 and the heisenberg model will be tabulated below , together with new results of the present work .",
    "the present work aims to provide an extensive and systematic monte carlo investigation of the phase transitions of the surfaces of the three - dimensional ising , @xmath4 , and heisenberg models .",
    "compared to numerical investigations one or two decades ago , one has the following advantages .",
    "firstly , the bulk critical points of these systems have now been determined accurately . on the simple cubic lattice , the bulk critical point of the ising model",
    "was determined as @xmath58  @xcite , with the uncertainty only in the eighth decimal place .",
    "the bulk transitions of the @xmath4 and the heisenberg model were also determined  @xcite to occur at @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively . in the present paper",
    ", we also simulate these two systems with periodic boundary conditions , and improve the above estimations as @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "secondly , the rapid development of computer technology makes it possible to perform extensive computations at a limited cost .",
    "the present work was performed on 20 pcs ; the total computer time is in the order of 20 cpu months at a processor speed of 2.5 ghz .",
    "the organization of the present paper is as follows .",
    "section ii reviews the finite - size - scaling properties of the systems defined by eq .  ( [ ham1 ] ) , with the emphasis on the sampled quantities required for the numerical analysis of the simulation data .",
    "section iii describes the determination of the critical points of the @xmath4 and heisenberg models .",
    "sections iv , v , and vi present the monte carlo simulations and the results for the ising , @xmath4 , and heisenberg models , respectively .",
    "section vii concludes the paper with a brief discussion .",

    "the bulk thermal and magnetic scaling fields are represented by @xmath40 and @xmath74 , and the surface scaling fields by @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the associated exponents are labeled with corresponding subscripts . as implied by eq .",
    "( [ bfree ] ) , the leading scaling behavior of the bulk does not depend on the presence of free surfaces , although physical quantities near the surfaces can be significantly affected .    on the basis of eqs .",
    "( [ bfree ] ) and ( [ sfree ] ) , the scaling behavior of various quantities can be obtained as derivatives of @xmath64 and @xmath77 with respect to the appropriate scaling fields .",
    "details can be found in ref .  .",
    "the determination of the bulk critical points used simulations of @xmath78 with periodic boundary conditions in which case @xmath65 vanishes .",
    "the sampling procedure involved the determination of the bulk magnetization density @xmath79 where @xmath80 .",
    "this yielded the averages of the magnetization moments @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the quantity @xmath83 which is related to the binder cumulant  @xcite , converges to a universal value @xmath84 at the critical point , and was used to determine the critical coupling @xmath51 .",
    "the finite - size scaling behavior of @xmath84 can be found by writing the moments of @xmath85 in terms of derivatives of the free energy with respect to the magnetic field .",

    "in order to investigate surface critical behavior , we simulated @xmath78 simple - cubic lattices with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath92 plane and free boundaries in the @xmath93 direction .",

    "thus the onset of long - range order on the surface also occurs at @xmath31 .",
    "this differs from the ising model , where a long - range ordered surface exists for @xmath30 if @xmath106 .",
    "we performed simulations at @xmath107 for the critical @xmath4 model with the system sizes in the range @xmath108 .",
    "we sampled the second moment of the surface magnetization @xmath109 and the ratio @xmath110 ; the data for these two quantities are shown in table  [ tab_3 ] .    in order to analyze the finite - size data in table  [ tab_3 ] , one first requires the proper scaling formulas . for the extraordinary phase transitions in the @xmath4 model , there exists some ambiguity , because it is not generally clear whether the surfaces undergo a first or a second order transition .",
    "nevertheless , in either case , the surfaces should display some critical singularities , arising from the diverging bulk correlation length .",
    "thus , we fitted the @xmath109 data by @xmath111 if the transition on the surface is first order at @xmath31 , the analytical contribution , @xmath112 , assumes a nonzero value .",

    ", it seems that the surface transition at @xmath31 and @xmath107 is first order .",
    "however , it seems also possible that the surface magnetization vanishes only very slowly as the system size @xmath103 increases , such that the line of extraordinary transitions on the surfaces is still kosterlitz - thouless - like .",
    "thus , we set @xmath124 in eq .",
    "( [ fitchi2 ] ) to zero , and fitted the unknown parameters including both @xmath121 and @xmath88 to the @xmath109 data .",

    "our numerical evidence for the surface magnetization of the three - dimensional @xmath4 model is not sufficient to determine whether the line of transitions for @xmath31 and @xmath106 is first or second order , but settling this matter convincingly would require extensive simulations , well beyond the scope of the present investigation",

    ". we also determined the bulk susceptibility @xmath140 and the dimensionless ratios @xmath110 and @xmath141 for a range of larger values of the surface enhancement @xmath142 .",
    "the scaled susceptibility @xmath143 is shown in fig .  [ fig08 ] .",
    "the intersections near @xmath144 are very suggestive of a special transition .",

    ", @xmath110 converges to a universal constant characteristic of the ordinary transition . for @xmath146",
    "the data seem to converge to a @xmath142-dependent value .",
    "the overall behavior of the results for @xmath110 resembles that of the ratio @xmath84 for bulk transitions in the kosterlitz - thouless universality class , as reported for the triangular ising antiferromagnet with nearest- and next - nearest - neighbor interactions @xcite . an alternative interpretation would be a special transition with a relevant exponent @xmath147 only slightly larger than 0 .",
    "a convincing numerical test of the kosterlitz - thouless nature of the special transition would require simulations beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we used monte carlo techniques and finite - size scaling in order to obtain new and more accurate results for the bulk and surface critical parameters of the three - dimensional ising , @xmath4 , and heisenberg models . at the ordinary phase transitions , we determined the surface magnetic exponents as @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 .",
    "these values are in a satisfactory agreement with earlier results @xcite , namely @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 , as shown in table  [ tab_2 ] .",
    "since the bulk thermal exponent @xmath43 of the o@xmath0 model decreases with increasing @xmath24 , these results suggest that the surface exponent @xmath154 is a decreasing function of @xmath43 .",
    "the same seems to hold true for the two- and three - dimensional potts models , as may be concluded on the basis of the following evidence . in three dimensions ,",
    "the surface magnetic exponent for the @xmath155 and @xmath156 potts models are @xmath157 and @xmath158  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the former model is generally referred to as the uniform spanning tree  @xcite , while the @xmath156 potts model reduces to the bond percolation model .",
    "for the two - dimensional potts model , from the conformal field theory , the exponent @xmath154 is exactly known as @xmath159  @xcite , which is a decreasing function of the bulk thermal exponent @xmath43 .",
    "further , if one applies the above expression to the tricritical branch of the potts model in two dimensions , one obtains that the surface magnetic scaling field is irrelevant at the ordinary phase transition .",
    "starting from this observation , it was found  @xcite that rich surface phase transitions can also occur in some two - dimensional systems , although their `` surfaces '' are just one - dimensional edges .    in the present work",
    ", we also located the special transitions of the ising and the @xmath4 model on the simple - cubic lattice , and obtained numerical estimates of the corresponding renormalization exponents .",
    "while the surface transition of the three - dimensional @xmath4 model is kosterlitz - thouless - like , and the line of surface transitions connects to the special transition point , our numerical data did not yield evidence for corrections to scaling due to a marginal field at the special transition .",
    "finally , we note that the surface - critical behavior of the o@xmath160 , o@xmath161 and o@xmath162 models is rather dissimilar for large surface enhancements . for the o@xmath160 model , spontaneous surface order exists even below the bulk critical coupling @xmath51 ; for the o@xmath161 model it exists for @xmath105 and possibly for @xmath31 ; and for the o@xmath162 model only for @xmath105 . in line with the bulk critical singularity , the o@xmath0 surface critical behavior is thus seen to become less singular with increasing @xmath24 .",
    "this is also evident from our analyses of the special transitions , which yield relevant exponents @xmath147 for the o(1 ) and o(2 ) models but allow a marginal exponent for the o(3 ) model .",
    "since the lower critical dimensionality of the special transition @xcite is 3 for @xmath35 , it seems plausible that the range @xmath163 corresponds with a line of fixed points and @xmath142-dependent critical surface exponents , in agreement with an analysis of the surface magnetization by krech @xcite .",
    "indeed , the data in figs .  [ fig08 ] and [ fig09 ] are suggestive of a kosterlitz - thouless - like scenario involving a nonuniversal range of @xmath84-values such as found earlier in the different context of the ising triangular antiferromagnet @xcite .",
