    "molecular ions provide a platform for many advances in quantum physics and chemistry @xcite .",

    "these advantages have motivated many recent research efforts centered around molecular ions , including studies of the time - variation of fundamental constants @xcite , searches for the electric dipole moment of the electron @xcite , and designs of quantum computing architectures in which molecular ion qubits are addressed by microwave @xcite and laser @xcite fields . necessarily , much progress has been made toward cooling molecular ions to quantum degeneracy : millikelvin translational temperatures and coulomb crystallisation have been demonstrated with hydride - like @xcite and more complex @xcite molecular ions via sympathetic cooling of the molecular species by co - trapped laser - cooled atomic ions ; and quenching of the rotational and vibrational motion of molecular ions has been achieved through sympathetic cooling by a cryogenic buffer gas @xcite , and by a co - trapped cloud of ultracold neutral atoms @xcite , respectively .    however , since the field of ultracold molecular ion physics is relatively young , one significant obstacle to progress in these experiments is the small pool of available spectrosopic data . in the past three decades",
    ", there have been relatively few experimental spectroscopic studies of diatomic molecular ions ( see saykally and woods summary of pre-1980 work in ref . , and as a representative yet non - exhaustive list of the work since then , see refs .  ) .    in this report",
    "we present spectroscopic data , and a detailed theoretical discussion , of the molecular ion dycl@xmath0 , which is an interesting candidate for molecular laser cooling , ultracold chemistry in atom - ion systems , and in the long - term , scalable quantum computing .",
    "the interest in dycl@xmath0 , and indeed the lanthanide halides in general , stems from the notion that unpaired electrons in the @xmath3 core of the lanthanide element play little or no part in the bonding of the molecular system @xcite . since excited states within the @xmath3 levels",
    "are often present at optical intervals , and laporte - forbidden @xmath4 transitions may be activated by vibrations and interactions with the ligand@xcite , this could give rise to optically addressable transitions with highly diagonal franck - condon factors .    owing to a heightened complexity , theoretical approximations regarding core electron configurations and molecular potentials in the lanthanide halides remain contestable . demonstrating agreement between experiment and theory will naturally help to strengthen the validity of our chosen theoretical methods .",

    "calculations show that there are 108 potential curves that dissociate to lowest spin - orbit ground states of dy@xmath0 and cl , which highlights the complex role played by the open @xmath5 shell of dy@xmath0 . only nine of these potentials are attractive and correspond to the `` ionically '' bonded dy@xmath24cl@xmath25 , where the outer 6s electron of dy has transferred into the cl @xmath120 shell .",
    "all other potential curves corresponding to these dissociation limits are repulsive .",
    "our experimental photodissociation cross section , obtained using an integrated ion trap and time - of - flight mass spectrometer , is found to agree satisfactorily with the calculations , given the myriad repulsive potentials and approximations made in the predicted transition moments .",
    "we observe a broad , asymmetric photodissociation cross section peaked at around 43,000 @xmath1 , which is well - represented by calculations assuming thermally populated internal molecular states .",
    "future work will aim to probe the existence of optically - addressable , vertical @xmath4 transitions in the molecule , towards its use in laser cooling , ultracold chemisty , and quantum information experiments .",

    "<S> we have performed a combined experimental and theoretical study of the photodissociation cross section of the molecular ion dycl@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the photodissociation cross section for the photon energy range 35,500 @xmath1 to 47,500 @xmath1 is measured using an integrated ion trap and time - of - flight mass spectrometer ; we observe a broad , asymmetric profile that is peaked near 43,000 @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical cross section is determined from electronic potentials and transition dipole moments calculated using the relativistic configuration - interaction valence - bond and coupled - cluster methods . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic structure of dycl@xmath0 is extremely complex due to the presence of multiple open electronic shells , including the 4f@xmath2 configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the molecule has nine attractive potentials with ionically - bonded electrons and 99 repulsive potentials dissociating to a ground state dy@xmath0 ion and cl atom . </S>",
    "<S> we explain the lack of symmetry in the cross section as due to multiple contributions from one - electron - dominated transitions between the vibrational ground state and several resolved repulsive excited states . </S>"
