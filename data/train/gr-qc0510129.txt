    "among the most promising and rewarding sources of gravitational radiation for the future lisa space - observatory @xcite are the so - called extreme mass ratio inspirals ( emris ) .",
    "these binary systems are formed as the result of the capture of compact stellar remnants by supermassive black holes in the nuclei of galaxies @xcite . as a result of two - body scattering in the surrounding cusp stellar population",
    ", such objects can end up on orbits that pass close to the central black hole .",
    "occasionally these objects are captured by the massive black hole s gravitational `` pit '' with initial orbital parameters which ensure that the subsequent dynamics of the newly formed binary are almost entirely governed by gravitational radiation .",
    "the expected event rate for this scenario is quite promising ( taking into account the capabilities of lisa ) , despite the uncertainties @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the detection of emris and the subsequent extraction for the system s parameters will rely heavily on the technique of matched filtering @xcite which requires an accurate theoretical model of the true gravitational wave signal .",
    "the computation of emri waveforms is an ongoing effort , which is currently limited by our inability to accurately describe the orbital motion of the small body in the kerr spacetime under the influence of radiation reaction . the traditional way of describing the system is via the celebrated teukolsky perturbation formalism @xcite ( where the system is modelled as a test - body in the field of a kerr black hole ) combined with the assumption of adiabatic evolution ( see @xcite,@xcite for recent reviews and further references ) .",
    "this latter property is well justified as a first order approximation : the system s extreme mass ratio @xmath5 guarantees that any influence of gravitational back - reaction will become significant at timescales much longer than any orbital timescale . in the adiabatic approach",
    "one first assumes that the small body is moving on a geodesic and computes averaged fluxes of energy @xmath6 and angular momentum @xmath7 for this orbit .",
    "these fluxes are used to update the parameters of the geodesic and the procedure is then repeated .",
    "this procedure works very well in special cases : orbits that are either equatorial , or inclined and circular .",
    "for those two families the change in the third integral of motion , the carter constant q , is either trivial or can be directly inferred from the other two fluxes .",
    "this is no longer possible for generic ( i.e. , eccentric and inclined ) orbits .",
    "dealing with them requires input from the more advanced framework of gravitational self - force computations ( see @xcite , @xcite for recent reviews in the field ) .    generating an inspiral and the associated waveform is a computationally expensive exercise even at the level of the teukolsky formalism , let alone a self - force based calculation .",
    "presently there are teukolsky - based results for equatorial or inclined - circular orbits that show how a given orbit would evolve under radiation reaction @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and recently some initial results have become available for generic orbits @xcite .",
    "however , to date the only available full inspiral computation is the one by hughes @xcite for circular - inclined orbits . a computation along the same lines can be carried out for equatorial - eccentric orbits and full generic inspirals should appear in the near future",
    ". however , these will be computationally very expensive .",
    "since present perturbative methods are either computationally demanding or incomplete it is highly desirable to have at hand a `` quick and dirty '' scheme for generating kerr inspirals and waveforms , which can then be utilised in crucial data analysis computations for lisa @xcite .",
    "glampedakis , hughes and kennefick @xcite ( hereafter ghk ) proposed a hybrid scheme for computing approximate generic emri trajectories .",
    "this hybrid scheme works by combining post - newtonian radiation reaction formulae with a strong - field definition of the orbital parameters .",
    "it is able to reproduce many of the features expected from true inspirals and compares well to existing teukolsky - based results @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    however , there are some significant problems with the approach in certain regions of the orbital phase space .",
    "we describe in the present paper a set of fixes and improvements to the ghk formalism that address these problems .",
    "the most crucial improvement comes from the study of the limiting cases of nearly circular and/or nearly polar orbits . in order to guarantee a smooth orbital evolution ,",
    "the exact fluxes need to satisfy certain consistency relations . by adding appropriate correction terms we can enforce the fluxes to satisfy these relations , thereby eliminating the pathologies of the ghk scheme in those regions of phase space .",
    "we also make improvements to the weak - flux expressions for @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "an immediate improvement comes from simply using available higher post - newtonian ( pn ) expressions . by combining tagoshi s",
    "@xcite 2.5pn fluxes for equatorial small - eccentricity orbits , shibata _ et al . _",
    "@xcite 2pn fluxes for circular small - inclination orbits and ryan s @xcite fluxes ( which are fully accurate in the leading newtonian and 1.5pn pieces ) , we construct approximate 2pn fluxes which perform well for practically all eccentricities and inclinations and improve the strong - field behaviour of the ghk inspirals .",
    "a further modification is to change the prescription for the evolution of the orbital inclination , or equivalently for the carter constant flux .",
    "ghk adopted the simple ( but fairly accurate ) rule of fixed inclination during inspiral .",
    "here we improve on this by adding the next order spin - dependent correction , and allowing inclination to evolve .",
    "a final improvement to the fluxes comes by fitting functions to the results of teukolsky - based computations for circular - inclined orbits @xcite .",
    "the combination of the above ingredients ensures the new hybrid scheme is applicable throughout parameter space , is qualitatively correct everywhere , and exhibits very good performance when compared to accurate , teukolsky - based inspirals .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ ghkscheme ]",
    "we give a brief overview of the ghk approach to computing inspirals . in sections  [ nearcirc][highinc ]",
    "we describe two corrections that are required to give physically reasonable behaviour in nearly circular and nearly polar inspirals .",
    "these corrections must be included when any approximation is used for the energy and angular momentum fluxes .",
    "then , in sections  [ 2pn][newqdot ] , we provide new flux approximations that are accurate to higher post - newtonian order than the leading order fluxes used in @xcite . in section  [ applications ]",
    "we illustrate the use of these expressions by investigating the properties of some example inspirals .",
    "finally , in section  [ conscorr ] , we briefly discuss the conservative component of the self - force which is not otherwise considered in this analysis . in the standard manner",
    "we adopt geometrised units @xmath8 .",
    "in the ghk paper @xcite , the orbit is reparameterized in terms of an eccentricity , @xmath1 , semi - latus rectum , @xmath0 , and inclination angle , @xmath2 .",
    "the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 are defined in terms of the turning points of the radial motion , which are determined by the roots of the radial potential @xmath9^{2}-\\left(r^{2}-2\\,m\\,r+a^{2}\\right)\\,\\left[\\mu^{2}\\,r^{2}+\\left(l_{z } -a\\,e\\right)^{2}+q\\right ] .",

    "once these have been determined from ( [ radpot ] ) , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are defined by @xmath17 the orbital inclination is defined in terms of the carter constant by @xmath18 in the limit @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and definition ( [ idef ] ) agrees with the usual notion of inclination .",
    "ghk constructed inspirals by evolving @xmath6 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",

    "for this reason , ghk used a `` constant inclination '' approximation to evolve @xmath14 @xmath23 the energy and angular momentum fluxes ( [ ghkedot][ghkldot ] ) are evaluated using the @xmath0 and @xmath1 given by definition ( [ pedef ] ) .",
    "this was found to work much better in the strong - field than re - writing the right hand sides of ( [ ghkedot])([ghkldot ] ) using the keplerian relation between @xmath6 , @xmath13 and @xmath0 , @xmath1 and evaluating the resulting expressions for the orbit with the same @xmath6 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the original ghk inspirals exhibit some unphysical features for nearly circular ( @xmath24 ) and nearly polar ( @xmath25 ) inspirals .",
    "these problems arise because the ghk approach uses post - newtonian expressions to evolve @xmath6 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which are only valid to certain orders in the spin , eccentricity etc . , but then computes the evolution of the eccentricity and semi - latus rectum using the _ exact _ transformation law , accurate to arbitrary order . as a consequence ,",
    "sensitive cancellations which are needed to ensure reasonable behaviour in certain limits do not occur and this leads to some bizarre behaviour .",
    "this can be ameliorated somewhat by extending the flux expressions to higher post - newtonian order ( see section  [ 2pn ] ) , but the problems are not eliminated entirely . however , it is possible to make corrections to the fluxes that force the necessary cancellations to occur .",
    "we describe these corrections in this and the following section .    in figure  [ circprob ]",
    "we show a selection of inspirals in the equatorial plane of a black hole with spin parameter @xmath26 .",
    "three inspirals are shown , with initial semi - latus rectums and eccentricities given by the pairs @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the inspirals have been computed using the original ghk fluxes ( [ ghkedot])([ghkldot ] ) .",
    "the unphysical behaviour near @xmath30 manifests itself in two ways . for inspirals that start with comparatively large semi - latus rectum , but very small eccentricity , the inspiral moves rapidly away from circularity  in fact , the trajectories are almost vertical near to the @xmath30 axis . for inspirals that start with high eccentricity , the turnover point at which the eccentricity starts to increase occurs at a higher value of @xmath31 than one would expect from teukolsky - based calculations @xcite .",
    "there is also a strange tendency for the curves to attract  for these quite diverse choices of initial parameters , every inspiral plunges at nearly the same point in phase space .",
    "changing from the original ghk fluxes to the higher order fluxes described in section  [ 2pn ] alleviates the rapid increase in eccentricity prior to plunge , but the nearly circular orbits are still pushed away from circularity and the trajectories still converge at plunge .      the origin of this problem can be understood by considering the behaviour of the fluxes near @xmath30 .",
    "the rate of change of the eccentricity is given by the fluxes of energy , angular momentum and the rate of change of the inclination angle , @xmath32 ( or equivalently , the flux of the carter constant @xmath33 ) by @xmath34 the partial derivatives may be derived from the definitions of the radial potential ( [ radpot ] ) and eccentricity ( [ pedef ] ) @xmath35 since the eccentricity enters this equation only as @xmath36 , it follows that @xmath6 , @xmath13 and the fluxes @xmath37 and @xmath38 must be functions of @xmath0 , @xmath36 and @xmath2 .",
    "the post - newtonian fluxes ( [ ghkedot])([ghkldot ] ) satisfy this condition .",
    "however , it also means that @xmath36 may be written as a function of @xmath6 and @xmath13 .",
    "we anticipate that @xmath39 is well behaved for all eccentricities , but @xmath40 will diverge like @xmath41 .",
    "differentiation of the condition ( [ edef ] ) yields the necessary partial derivatives @xmath42 the substitution @xmath43 leaves the right hand side of these expressions unchanged , so as expected the derivatives are functions of @xmath36 only .",

    "it is now clear from ( [ edot ] ) that @xmath50 for small @xmath1 , unless the fluxes satisfy a consistency condition in the limit @xmath51 @xmath52 we will see in section  [ highinc ] that it can be better to evolve the carter constant , @xmath14 , instead of @xmath2 . using the definition ( [ idef ] ) to write @xmath32 in terms of @xmath33 and @xmath53 , ( [ circcond ] ) becomes @xmath54 where @xmath55 it is understood that the @xmath56 s are evaluated for the circular orbit with the specified @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "the ghk fluxes @xcite do _ not _ satisfy this relation , which explains the bizarre behaviour seen for small eccentricity .",
    "what does the condition ( [ circcond ] ) or ( [ circcondqform ] ) mean physically ?",
    "for simplicity , we first examine equatorial orbits before extending to inclined orbits . in the equatorial plane ,",
    "@xmath57 by symmetry , and this condition is satisfied by the ghk scheme ( [ ghkidot ] ) . in the circular equatorial",
    "limit , the energy and angular momentum are given in terms of the semi - latus rectum by @xmath58 where the upper ( lower ) sign is for prograde ( retrograde ) orbits .",
    "we find that condition ( [ circcond ] ) reduces to @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the azimuthal velocity , @xmath61 , of the circular orbit .",
    "expression ( [ eqcond ] ) is just the condition that circular orbits remain circular under radiation reaction , which must be true for the actual gravitational waves emitted by the orbit @xcite .",
    "the general condition ( [ circcond ] ) is similarly just another way to write the circular goes to circular rule @xcite . by forcing the leading term to cancel from our @xmath62 expression ,",
    "we ensure that @xmath63 and therefore that @xmath64 for circular orbits .",
    "we can compute the difference @xmath65 for circular equatorial orbits under the ghk scheme . expanding in powers of the spin parameter , @xmath66 , we find @xmath67 the cancellation occurs correctly to linear order in the spin .",
    "this is expected since the fluxes were derived in a low - spin limit .",
    "if we use the higher order fluxes ( [ new_edot])([new_ldot ] ) described in section  [ 2pn ] , we similarly find @xmath68 in each case , the cancellation occurs to the post - newtonian order at which the fluxes were derived",
    ". however , when we use the fluxes to evolve inspirals , this is no longer accurate enough since we are using definitions of eccentricity and semi - latus rectum that are accurate to arbitrary order .",
    "since we know that the circular goes to circular rule must hold for real inspirals , we can improve our approximate scheme by modifying our fluxes to enforce this condition .",
    "the condition ( [ circcond ] ) is a relationship between the fluxes for circular orbits .",
    "the easiest way to impose it is to specify two of the flux expressions and use ( [ circcond ] ) to determine the other .",
    "since this relation applies only to circular orbits , we adopt the approach of leaving the eccentricity corrections largely unchanged , and correct only the circular piece of the fluxes .",
    "however , we must include the usual @xmath69 factor in front of the near - circular correction to ensure reasonable behaviour at high eccentricity . as the eccentricity approaches the parabolic limit , @xmath70 ,",
    "at fixed semi - latus rectum , we expect the total change in @xmath6 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath2 to be approximately constant , since the strong - field part of the orbit , where most of the radiation is lost , does not change significantly",
    ". however , the orbital period diverges like @xmath71 , and therefore the orbital averaged flux must tend to zero in the same way .",
    "this is the origin of the @xmath69 prefactor in ( [ ghkedot])([ghkldot ] ) , and we must also include it in the circular correction .",
    "we can not reliably say anything about further eccentricity corrections , since such corrections are higher order than the available post - newtonian results .",
    "our approach ensures that the eccentricity pieces are asymptotically correct and the new fluxes have the right leading order behaviour at high eccentricity .",
    "it may be possible to get more accurate expressions by applying the correction to the other eccentricity terms as well , but a priori we have no justification for doing this .",
    "if we chose to fix @xmath37 and @xmath72 by expressions ( [ ghkedot])([ghkldot ] ) and use ( [ circcond ] ) to determine @xmath32 , we would find that @xmath73 in the equatorial plane , which is unphysical . for simplicity ,",
    "we want to use the same correction throughout parameter space , so we will modify either @xmath37 or @xmath38 . in figure  [ circfix ]",
    "we show new equatorial inspirals computed by imposing the fix in two different ways . for the solid lines we use the post - newtonian @xmath37 expression ( [ ghkedot ] ) , and correct the circular piece of the post - newtonian @xmath38 using ( [ circcond ] ) . for the dashed lines ,",
    "we leave the post - newtonian @xmath72 expression ( [ ghkldot ] ) unchanged , and correct the circular piece of the @xmath37 expression .",
    "we note first that it does not make a great deal of difference which way the fix is implemented .",
    "the trajectories differ a little near to plunge , but are largely the same .",
    "the most striking feature of figure  [ circfix ] is how much better the inspirals now look .",
    "the orbits are no longer pushed away from circularity and the turnover in the eccentricity occurs much later  both features that are expected in true inspirals",
    ". the different trajectories also plunge at somewhat more different points .",
    "there is some excess growth in eccentricity close to plunge , but this is due to the failure of the ghk flux expressions ( [ ghkedot])([ghkldot ] ) . using higher order expressions ( see section  [ 2pn ] ) , eliminates this feature .",
    "we conclude that it does not make too much difference how the fix is imposed , but imposing the fix gives a significant improvement in the qualitative behaviour of the inspirals deep in the strong - field region of the spacetime .    in the limit of a nearly polar orbit",
    ", we find that @xmath74 and @xmath75 both diverge like @xmath76 , while @xmath77 is finite ( this will be discussed in more detail in the next section ) . as a result ,",
    "if we specify @xmath38 and @xmath32 and use ( [ circcond ] ) to correct the circular piece of @xmath37 , the correction diverges in the limit @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , when evolving @xmath2 one should use @xmath37 and @xmath32 to correct @xmath38 .",
    "however , if we evolve @xmath14 instead of @xmath2 , the functions @xmath79 and @xmath80 are both finite at the pole and there is no problem .",
    "however , @xmath81 vanishes for certain retrograde orbits .",
    "using @xmath37 and @xmath33 to correct @xmath72 would therefore lead to a divergence at this point ( unless @xmath37 and @xmath33 are constrained to cancel appropriately ) .",
    "thus , when evolving @xmath14 , it is better to use @xmath72 and @xmath33 to correct @xmath37 .",
    "the modified @xmath37 is @xmath82 \\label{edotcorr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this , @xmath83 refer to the prescription of the energy and angular momentum fluxes being used , e.g. , ( [ ghkldot ] ) , ( [ ghkidot ] ) in this case .",
    "if the fluxes are modified ( e.g. , to the 2pn expressions given in section  [ 2pn ] ) the correction is applied as above , with @xmath84 replaced by @xmath85 etc .",
    "the ghk hybrid scheme also exhibits some pathological behaviour for orbits that are nearly polar , i.e. , with @xmath25 . in figure  [ kgpolar ]",
    "we show inspirals for four different initial inclination angles , computed under the original ghk scheme .",
    "the inspirals have two strange properties .",
    "firstly , the transition passing across the pole is not smooth  there is a discontinuity between trajectories with @xmath2 slightly less than @xmath86 , and those with @xmath2 slightly above @xmath86 .",
    "in fact , it is not possible to compute trajectories in this approximation for @xmath2 slightly less than @xmath87 , since it predicts an increase in @xmath0 .",
    "secondly , orbits with high prograde inclinations rapidly circularise , which is unphysical .",
    "this latter effect looks like a manifestation of the problem @xmath50 for small @xmath1 discussed in the previous section , but the coefficient of proportionality is now positive .",
    "we might hope that the correction for near - circular orbits discussed above will fix this problem .",
    "figure  [ kgpolarpluscirc ] shows the same set of inspirals , computed including the near - circular correction ( [ edotcorr ] ) .",
    "as expected , the correction does fix the rapid circularization problem , but the transition across the pole is still discontinuous .    the remaining problem near @xmath88",
    "can again be understood by considering the behaviour of @xmath62 ( or @xmath89 ) in that limit .",
    "the derivatives @xmath90 and @xmath91 are both singular , diverging like @xmath92 as @xmath78 .",
    "this is clear from looking at @xmath93 and @xmath94 in that limit ( [ ederivs ] ) .",
    "in fact , in terms of the carter constant @xmath14 of the polar orbit , we find @xmath95 the divergence of @xmath62 , which corresponds to a divergence in @xmath96 and @xmath97 is unphysical .",
    "it will be avoided if the singularities in the @xmath13 and @xmath2 fluxes cancel appropriately , which implies @xmath98 there is nothing special about polar orbits which should allow us to specify an additional condition , so where does ( [ polarcond ] ) come from ?",
    "this is answered by looking at the derivative of the carter constant @xmath99 the condition ( [ polarcond ] ) is equivalent to requiring that @xmath33 is finite in the limit @xmath78 . the problem has arisen because we have chosen to evolve the inclination angle rather than evolve @xmath14 directly . a real radiation field will generate a finite change in the carter constant , and the rate of change of @xmath2 computed from this will automatically satisfy ( [ polarcond ] ) . the main thing this tells us is that the constant inclination approximation , @xmath57 , is unphysical ",
    "polar orbits lose angular momentum , which drives them to become retrograde .",
    "an alternative prescription for the evolution of @xmath2 is therefore required .",
    "if we specify @xmath72 and @xmath32 at some post - newtonian order , the relation ( [ polarcond ] ) will not hold exactly , as @xmath100 is accurate to arbitrary pn order .",
    "we can account for this by adding a correction to @xmath72 , as for the near circular correction .",
    "however , since this correction is only required at the pole , it is difficult to extend it smoothly to non - polar orbits .",
    "the need for a correction can be eliminated entirely if we evolve @xmath14 instead of @xmath2 , i.e. , we choose to specify @xmath33 and derive @xmath32 from this .",
    "ryan s expression @xcite for @xmath33 , written in terms of our orbital elements is @xmath101 , \\",

    "figure  [ allfixpolar ] shows the set of inspirals depicted in figures  [ kgpolar ] and [ kgpolarpluscirc ] , but now evolved using ( [ qdot_ryan ] ) instead of the constant inclination approximation .",
    "the resulting inspirals now change smoothly as the inclination angle is increased .",
    "however , the change in @xmath2 over the course of the inspiral is much too large when compared to the results of teukolsky computations for circular orbits @xcite .",
    "this is the reason ghk chose to evolve @xmath2 rather than @xmath14 . in section  [ newqdot ]",
    "we will show how to improve the approximation for @xmath33 to give more reasonable evolutions .",
    "the corrections discussed in the previous two sections must be applied in any version of the hybrid scheme , and ensure that the inspiral properties are physically reasonable .",

    "the hybrid scheme includes the correct separatrix by construction and figure  [ circstab ] indicates that the new hybrid fluxes recover the critical curve very well , so we can have some confidence that inspirals generated under this improved hybrid scheme are qualitatively correct .      the hybrid flux expressions allow us to compute the rates of loss of energy and angular momentum from an arbitrary geodesic orbit .",
    "the true fluxes are given by solution of the teukolsky equation , and we can compare the hybrid results to existing teukolsky - based results available in the literature . this comparison is shown in table  [ fluxcomp ] .",
    "the table is divided into three sections .",
    "the top section is for circular and inclined orbits , for which the teukolsky data was provided by scott hughes @xcite .",
    "the middle section is for eccentric and equatorial orbits , for which the teukolsky data was taken from glampedakis and kennefick @xcite .",
    "the bottom section is for generic orbits , and the teukolsky data was taken from drasco and hughes @xcite . in each case",
    "we tabulate the hybrid and teukolsky - based fluxes of energy and angular momentum , plus the rate of change of inclination angle .",
    "drasco and hughes use the `` spherical '' formula ( [ ghkidot ] ) to evolve the inclination angle , which we have seen to be inaccurate .",
    "the teukolsky results should not therefore be regarded as more accurate for that comparison .",
    "overall , the agreement between the hybrid and teukolsky results is remarkably good .",
    "the agreement for circular , inclined orbits is excellent , but this is unsurprising since we used teukolsky data to fit the circular part of the hybrid fluxes .",
    "the hybrid scheme also performs very well for orbits of low eccentricity , but the performance is a little worse for orbits of higher eccentricity , particularly in the strong - field .",
    "specifically , we see the decrease in @xmath211 with increasing eccentricity for @xmath192 m and @xmath212 m that was discussed earlier , and find one prograde equatorial orbit that has @xmath213 .",
    "this is a consequence of the missing eccentricity - dependent terms in the fluxes . in the future ,",
    "deriving a fit to the missing terms using teukolsky - based data should correct these remaining problems .",
    ".comparison of hybrid and teukolsky - based results .",
    "we tabulate the fluxes of energy and angular momentum and the rate of change of the inclination angle , @xmath2 , for a variety of geodesics .",
    "these are divided into circular / inclined ( top section ) , eccentric / equatorial ( middle section ) and eccentric / inclined ( bottom section ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the main application of the hybrid scheme is to generate inspiral trajectories .",
    "these can be used to investigate the general properties of extreme mass ratio inspirals , and also as input for the generation of approximate gravitational waveforms @xcite .",
    "such approximate waveforms are being used for scoping out data analysis issues for the detection of emris with lisa @xcite and may also find application as detection templates in the final analysis of lisa data .    in figure  [ finalinspcomp ]",
    "we illustrate some inspirals in the @xmath214 plane computed using the final form of the hybrid scheme ( [ ldotfinal ] ) for a black hole of spin @xmath215 m .",
    "we show the same inspirals as computed under the original ghk scheme for comparison .",
    "the improvement of the new scheme over the old one is quite evident and the old pathologies are no longer present . in figure  [ peinsp ]",
    "we show a further sequence of inspirals in the @xmath214 plane computed under the new hybrid scheme .",
    "these all have initial semi - latus rectum of @xmath216 m , and have a variety of eccentricities , inclinations and spins .",
    "every inspiral has the same basic structure @xmath217 initially the orbit circularises as it inspirals , but once the orbit gets close to plunge , a critical point is reached where @xmath64 and the eccentricity then begins to increase until the object plunges into the black hole .",
    "orbits of lower initial eccentricity circularise less rapidly . as the spin of the central black hole",
    "is increased , the plunge point moves closer to the central black hole , and so does the critical radius .",
    "orbits of higher inclination plunge further from the central black hole , so the net effect of spin is reduced , as is clear from the @xmath218 panel in figure  [ peinsp ] .",
    "figure  [ piinsp ] illustrates the same inspirals , but shows how the inspiral proceeds in the @xmath219 plane .",
    "we see that , typically , @xmath2 changes only slightly over the inspiral , but always increases .",
    "the magnitude of this change increases as the spin is increased , and is greater for orbits nearer to polar ( @xmath220 ) than for nearly equatorial ( @xmath221 ) orbits .",
    "orbits of lower initial eccentricity also exhibit a lower total change in inclination over the inspiral . for low spins , the change in @xmath2 is less than @xmath222 , but it can be somewhat larger ( @xmath223 ) for near polar inspirals into rapidly rotating black holes .",
    "these features , and the non - zero , but small , increase in inclination is in good agreement with the results of teukolsky - based calculations @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have focused on improving the computation of the trajectories that emris follow in phase space , specifically the evolution of the three principal constants of the motion , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath14 .",
    "these three constants determine the shape of any given geodesic .",
    "however , a geodesic also has three additional `` positional '' constants of the motion , which essentially label the position of the particle along the geodesic trajectory at some fiducial time .",
    "the self - force interaction between the inspiralling body and the central black hole acts to change not only the principal constants of the motion ( the dissipative self - force ) , but also the positional constants ( the conservative self - force ) . in this",
    "analysis we have looked only at the dissipative contribution .",
    "however , the influence of the conservative self - force on the orbital evolution can not be ignored , since it could lead to several cycles of phase discrepancy in template waveforms over the course of an inspiral . in a recent paper @xcite pound explored a toy problem in which an orbiting charged particle experienced both a dissipative and a conservative electromagnetic self - force .",
    "they found that in the weak - field the phasing contribution from the conservative self - force was comparable to or larger than the dissipative contribution .",
    "while that particular analysis was not applicable in the strong - field regime and did not look at the gravitational self - force directly , it is likely that the conservative gravitational self - force will have a significant influence on the phasing of an inspiral .",
    "the conservative self - force alters the orbit that an inspiralling body with particular energy etc . follows",
    "this change in the orbit in principle will modify the radiated fluxes of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath14 .",
    "however , this is a much lower order effect and so can be ignored .",
    "the expressions presented here can therefore be accurately used to model emri phase space trajectories . on the other hand , conservative effects",
    "should be included when an inspiral path ( i.e. , the path through space which the orbiting body follows ) is computed based on the phase space evolution .",
    "this is the next step in constructing approximate waveforms ( see discussion in next section and figure  [ snapshots ] ) .",
    "one way to add conservative effects is to include the three positional constants of the motion when parameterising the orbit and evolve these as well as the principal constants along the phase space trajectory .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in @xcite .",
    "perturbative calculations have not yet reached the stage of computing the conservative self - force for strong - field orbits , although this should be possible in the near future for schwarzschild orbits @xcite .",
    "there are post - newtonian expressions for the conservative self - force available in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) , so it should be possible to put together existing results to construct a hybrid scheme for the evolution of the positional orbital constants , along similar lines to the hybrid scheme described in this paper for the principal constants",
    ". however , this is a complicated procedure and we leave it for a future paper .",
    "in this paper we have described a number of ways to alter the ghk hybrid scheme in order to expand its validity and reliability .",
    "the inclusion of all of these corrections leads to inspirals that are physically reasonable and seem qualitatively correct throughout parameter space .",
    "moreover , direct comparisons of the hybrid fluxes to teukolsky - based results indicate that the approach performs well .",
    "however , at present we can only judge the scheme based on physical intuition and lessons learnt from studies of specific families of orbits ( equatorial - eccentric and circular - inclined ) and the limited number of fluxes for generic ( inclined - eccentric ) orbits that are currently available @xcite . as more extensive results for generic orbits are generated in the near future",
    ", we will be able to more thoroughly test this new hybrid scheme and improve it if necessary .",
    "an important point to note is that the new scheme is still computationally inexpensive , which is why it is valuable to pursue this approach in conjunction with more accurate perturbative calculations .",
    "there are a number of ways in which the scheme might be further improved in the future .",
    "the @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath33 flux expressions , ( [ new_edot_2])([new_ldot_2 ] ) and ( [ qdot_new ] ) , could be improved by including additional terms .",
    "the current expressions do not include all eccentricity terms , and we saw in section  [ eccterms ] that additional terms currently available in the literature can be easily included , although these do not appear to improve the performance of the hybrid scheme .",
    "however , it should hopefully still be possible to gain improvements by using higher order pn results as these become available .",
    "the spin - independent terms could also be amended by using the 2pn fluxes derived by gopakumar and iyer @xcite for a binary system with non - spinning members moving in quasi - elliptical orbits . a modification like the latter should improve the numerical inspirals for @xmath224 .",
    "another approach would be to construct the pad approximants of the pn fluxes , which are typically more effective than the original taylor - series fluxes @xcite .",
    "once generic teukolsky data is available , the scheme could also be enhanced by improving the eccentricity - dependent pieces of the @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath32 fluxes using fits to the teukolsky results . as discussed in section  [ conscorr ] , a significant gap in the present hybrid scheme is the omission of conservative self - force corrections . while this omission does not affect the phase space inspiral trajectories described here , it might significantly influence the gravitational waveform phasing and can not therefore be ignored .",
    "using pn results and data from perturbative self - force calculations , it should be possible to include the conservative self - force by computing a `` positional '' phase space trajectory in conjunction with the `` principal '' phase space trajectory described here .",
    "this will be pursued in the future .",
    "a key point to remember in any future version of the hybrid scheme is that the consistency condition ( [ circcond ] ) must be satisfied by the fluxes in order to produce reasonable inspirals . to incorporate this correction",
    ", we added a term to the energy flux that is essentially the difference between the prescribed energy flux and what it should be to be consistent with the prescribed angular momentum and inclination fluxes .",
    "as the flux expressions are pushed to higher and higher order , the size of this correction will naturally diminish and we will ultimately converge to the true adiabatic inspiral .",
    "the conditions ( [ circcond ] ) and ( [ polarcond ] ) also have some relevance for teukolsky - based calculations for generic orbits .",
    "until recently , these had been carried out only for circular orbits of arbitrary inclination @xcite and equatorial orbits of arbitrary eccentricity @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the additional symmetries allow the carter constant to be evolved correctly .",
    "more recently , teukolsky - based calculations have been carried out for `` snapshots '' of generic orbits @xcite . due to the difficulties in computing the evolution of the carter constant for a generic inspiral , these results made use of the constant inclination approximation , @xmath57 , to compute @xmath33 .",
    "it is clear from the analysis here that this will not work for nearly circular or nearly polar orbits , since we need the correct @xmath32 in those limits to ensure conditions ( [ circcond ] ) and ( [ polarcond ] ) are satisfied .",
    "the constant inclination approach is therefore problematic .",
    "however , the new formula for the evolution of @xmath14 presented by sago _",
    "@xcite allows computation of @xmath33 using the same teukolsky variables used to evaluate @xmath37 and @xmath72 .",
    "future generic codes should make use of this new formula to avoid the consistency problems described here .",
    "as mentioned earlier , inspirals generated using this hybrid scheme can be used to investigate the qualitative properties of emris , and also to construct approximate , `` kludge '' , emri waveforms for use in lisa data analysis . by integrating the kerr geodesic equations along the trajectory through phase space constructed using the method described here , the path followed by a particle can be computed in boyer - lindquist coordinates . identifying these coordinates with spherical polar coordinates and",
    "constructing the corresponding flat space quadrupole moment tensor allows the generation of an approximate gravitational waveform .",
    "such waveforms are being used to scope out lisa data analysis algorithms @xcite . in figure  [ snapshots ] we show short snippets of the kludge gravitational waveform from one of the inspirals illustrated in figures  [ peinsp ] and [ piinsp ] , with @xmath225 m and initial parameters @xmath216 m , @xmath226 and @xmath227 .",
    "the snippets are of @xmath228s duration ( assuming masses of @xmath229 and @xmath230 ) and are shown at four points along the inspiral trajectory .",
    "we include this figure for illustration purposes only .",
    "more details on the construction of kludge waveforms can be found in @xcite .",
    "we thank stanislav babak and scott hughes for useful discussions and scott hughes for supplying the teukolsky data used in computing the fits for the radiation from circular orbits .",
