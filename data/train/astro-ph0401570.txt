    "probing the high - mass end of the galaxy mass function at any epoch provides a particularly strong test of theories of galaxy formation . a zoo of apparently massive objects at high redshift has been discovered in recent years , in a broad range of wavelengths and utilizing a variety of selection techniques .",
    "for example , at this meeting , we heard about massive galaxies at @xmath0 in the combo-17/gems survey ( bell , rix ) , vimos ( le fevre ) , and deep ( koo , newman ) , near ir selected galaxies and extremely red objects ( eros ) at @xmath02 ( fontana , daddi , drory , cimatti ) , color - selected galaxies in the spectroscopic redshift ` desert ' at @xmath1 - 2.5 ( steidel , chen ) , and sub - mm and mm selected galaxies at @xmath2 ( chapman , bertoldi , genzel ) .",
    "the challenge posed to us by the multi - wavelength universe is to unify this zoo of objects into a coherent picture of galaxy evolution .",
    "another exciting observational development is the imaging of relatively large fields with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , combined with multi - wavelength ground - based observations .",
    "these new surveys , such as goods ( great observatories origins deep survey ) , gems ( galaxy evolution from morphology and seds ) , and cosmos , will for the first time allow us to study the connection between galaxy morphology ( through structural parameters such as bulge - to - disk ratio ) and stellar populations ( through broad band colors and spectroscopy ) for a statistically meaningful sample , over a large range of cosmic time .",
    "we can then go beyond a global census of star formation or the build - up of stellar mass , to understand _ where and how _ stars were formed , and perhaps which processes stimulated or regulated star formation . in this paper ,",
    "i shall attempt to briefly summarize the status of our theoretical understanding of some of these observational results and what we may learn about galaxy formation from them .",
    ", @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 ( from top to bottom , as labeled ) , as a function of redshift .",
    "points show the estimated comoving number densities of several observed populations , as follows .",
    "hexagons : galaxies with stellar masses greater than @xmath7 ( lower point ) and @xmath8 ( higher point ) , obtained by integrating the stellar mass function of @xcite from sdss+2mass ; open square : extremely red objects @xcite ; ppen triangle : k20 galaxies @xcite ; crosses : sub - mm galaxies @xcite ; six pointed stars : lyman break galaxies @xcite , filled square : quasars @xcite . for all populations ,  predicts that there are enough dark matter halos massive enough to plausibly host the observed objects ( see text).,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    it has become a familiar story : in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model of structure formation , small mass objects form first , and larger mass objects form hierarchically through mergers and accretion .",
    "therefore , measurements of the number density of massive structures at high redshift pose _ potentially _ strong constraints on this class of models .",
    "the extent to which this potential is realized , however , depends on how massive and how common are the objects at any given epoch .",
    "moreover , such arguments also require making a connection between an observed population and the dark matter halos in which they are expected to reside . for most , if not all , of the populations mentioned above , this is far from straightforward .",
    "it is a common perception that the detection of massive galaxies at high redshift is a serious problem for cdm .",
    "it is interesting to take a step back for a moment from the complexities of modeling gas physics , star formation , feedback , radiative transfer , stellar populations , etc . , and",
    "to simply ask whether the ` concordance '  model produces enough massive _ dark matter halos _ to plausibly host the objects that have been detected .",
    "this simple exercise is carried out in fig .",
    "[ fig : numz ] , which shows the predicted cumulative comoving number density of dark matter halos above a given mass , from @xmath9@xmath10 as labeled , as a function of redshift , @xmath11 , @xmath12 km / s / mpc , @xmath13=0.9 . ] .",
    "these were obtained from the sheth - tormen modified press - schechter model @xcite .",
    "also shown are the estimated comoving number densities of various observed populations , as described in the figure caption .",
    "it has been claimed that the sub - mm galaxies , eros and k20 @xmath14 objects have stellar masses of a few times @xmath15 @xcite . making the plausible assumptions that about fifteen percent of the total mass is in the form of baryons , and a few tenths of the baryons are in stars",
    ", one can easily accommodate the observed numbers of objects within suitably massive dark matter halos of @xmath16 .",
    "the lyman break galaxies , which are more numerous but probably have stellar masses about an order of magnitude smaller ( a few times @xmath17 ; @xcite ) are also easily accommodated within halos of a few times @xmath15 .",
    "even the @xmath18 quasars detected by sdss @xcite , which must harbor black holes of @xmath19 if they are eddington limited , can be easily accommodated within @xmath20 halos ( see @xcite for more detailed modeling of these objects ) .",
    "so far , none of the observed populations poses a _ fundamental _ problem for concordance @xmath21 . had the observed number density of @xmath15 galaxies at @xmath22 been an order of magnitude higher than the current estimates",
    ", theorists would have good cause to squirm .",
    "as it is , these results suggest that there were fewer massive galaxies in the past , in qualitative agreement with hierarchical structure formation .",
    "the challenge now lies in understanding how , where and why the stars and dust that make these objects visible to us are formed .",
    "this requires getting our hands a bit more dirty .",

    ", scaledwidth=90.0% ]    there are several distinct methods of tracing the global history of star formation and the build - up of stellar mass in the universe observationally .",
    "one is to measure star formation rates by directly counting actively star forming galaxies via various tracers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "another is to detect established galaxies at different redshifts , estimate their stellar masses from their colors or spectra , and sum the masses up to obtain a global average @xcite . yet",
    "a third approach is to measure the ages of stellar populations and use galactic ` archeology ' to deduce something about star formation at earlier times ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is useful to compare the results obtained from all three methods , as the attendant errors and selection effects are different .",
    "[ fig : sfh ] shows a compilation of measurements of the star formation history of the universe from @xmath24 to the present , including the recent results from goods @xcite .",
    "the solid curve shows the integrated star formation rate density predicted by a fairly standard semi - analytic model ( similar to the ` accelerated quiescent ' model of @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that this model produced good agreement with existing ( dust - corrected ) observational estimates of the star formation history to @xmath25 ; it is encouraging that the same model agrees almost uncannily well with the new measurements out to @xmath24 from @xcite .",
    "the dashed curve is the updated model of @xcite , which i shall return to later .",
    "let us now turn to fig .",
    "[ fig : mah ] , which shows the total _ stellar mass density _ as a function of redshift .",
    "the solid line is the mass density of all stars from the same semi - analytic model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfh ] .",
    "symbols show observational estimates , as described in the figure caption .",
    "obviously , in an ideal world , and neglecting recycling from stellar mass loss , this curve should be the integral of the curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfh ] . for the semi - analytic model ,",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "given that the semi - analytic model is quite a good fit to the observational results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfh ] , we would obtain something quite similar if we simply integrated a curve fit to the observed star formation history .",
    "however , although if anything the sfr produced by the semi - analytic model is a bit on the low side at low redshift ( which dominates the integral ) , the total mass produced by the present day is on the high side . at @xmath26 , the observational estimates of the total mass in established systems are more than 50 percent lower than the model , or than the integrated star formation curve .",
    "this could be due to several factors .",
    "one possibility is that the imf changes with time ( for example , is more top - heavy at early times ) .",
    "another is that the total star formation rate has been overestimated , perhaps because of dust corrections , or completeness corrections .",
    "a third is that galaxies are missing from the stellar mass census ( @xcite show that this is likely to be the case at high redshift ) or that the stellar masses are systematically underestimated .",
    "this shows that a -based galaxy formation model has no difficulty producing enough early stars or star formation _",
    "globally_. similar results have been found based on hydrodynamic n - body simulations by e.g. @xcite .",
    "similarly , the model predicts that roughly half of the present day stellar mass was in place by @xmath22 , and seventy percent by @xmath0 , implying that there should be enough old stars ( @xmath27 gyr ) at @xmath23 to satisfy the ` fossil evidence ' in present day galaxies .",
    "the new challenge is to go beyond global quantities like those discussed above , and to ask what kind of galaxies host those stars and where the star formation is occurring .",
    "for example , we know that most of the stellar mass in the local universe is contained in old , massive , spheroids , while most of the star formation is occuring in smaller - mass , disk - dominated objects . the new generation of multi - wavelength surveys is allowing us to determine whether this was true at earlier times .",
    "the results will pose much more stringent constraints on models .",
    "current indications are that the same hierarchical models that do well at reproducing global quantities , as discussed above , do much less well at producing the correct proportions of different types of galaxies as a function of redshift . in particular",
    ", while the models seem to produce _ enough stellar mass globally _ , at redshifts of about unity and above they do not produce as many massive / luminous _ red _ galaxies as are observed .",
    "for example , it has been noted in several different studies ( e.g. @xcite ) that semi - analytic models do not produce enough ` extremely red objects ' ( eros ) , objects with observed - frame optical - infrared colors redder than a passively evolving elliptical ( e.g. @xmath286 ) , which tend to be at redshifts @xmath29 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "semi - analytic models underproduce these objects by factors of two to ten , depending on the precise color and magnitude cut , and the specific star formation recipes used .",
    "also , although semi - analytic models can be tuned to give passable agreement with the rest frame @xmath30 color - magnitude relation at @xmath23 , the model fails to produce enough luminous / massive , red , bulge - dominated galaxies at @xmath311 , based on measurements from combo-17 and the deep redshift survey .",
    "a possibly related problem is that , when absorption and emission by dust are modeled in detail , semi - analytic models also fail to produce enough luminous sub - mm galaxies @xcite , now believed to be predominantly at redshifts @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "this problem is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfh ] : the dashed curve shows the star formation density needed to account for the sub - mm sources and the far - ir extragalactic background @xcite .",
    "the required star formation at @xmath332.5 greatly exceeds that predicted by the semi - analytic models or hydro simulations .",
    "one way to solve this problem is to assume that the imf was very top - heavy at early times , or in starbursts ( which account for a larger fraction of star formation at high redshift ) , as we heard from cedric lacey at this meeting .",
    "it is possible , though , that these two problems are reflections of the same underlying difficulty : perhaps not enough massive objects are being created ( in huge dust - enshrouded bursts ) at @xmath34 , which is why not enough old , red , quiescent massive objects are in place at @xmath02",
    ". however , the integrated stellar mass density at low redshift poses a strong constraint  it would clearly be exceeded if the blain et al .",
    "curve were integrated .",
    "this remains a puzzle .",
    "to summarize , hierarchical models of galaxy formation ( whether based on semi - analytic or n - body+hydro techniques ) are currently able to satisfy observational constraints on the global history of star formation and stellar mass assembly from _ optically selected _ galaxies , from @xmath24 to the present .",
    "however , they fail badly at reproducing two very different kinds of massive objects at high redshift : quiescent red spheroids , and vigorously star forming , heavily dust - obscured ulirg - like objects detected in the mid - ir and sub - mm .",
    "it is possible , though not certain , that these problems are connected .",
    "one can think of many physical mechanisms , neglected in the current modeling , that could _ quench _ star formation and produce more red objects , but these mechanisms alone could only make galaxies dimmer and less massive .",
    "what seems to be needed is a mechanism that _ boosts _ star formation but then rapidly _ quenches _ it  in massive systems preferentially .",
    "this may sound like an old story ( monolithic dissipative collapse ) .",
    "what is needed is a _ physical mechanism _ that produces such a process within the framework of the otherwise largely successful hierarchical structure formation model .",
    "there is a growing belief that agn - driven feedback will probably play a major role in solving these problems , but many details remain to be worked out .",
    "i conclude that the multi - wavelength universe is a messy but exciting place to live .",
