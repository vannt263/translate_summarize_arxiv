    "it is shown that , in the  absence of the interaction between electrons , the system possesses the su(2 ) symmetry arising from the time reversal symmetry .",
    "remarkably , we find that the influence of the on - site interaction on the symmetry depends on the topology of the networks in the following way .",
    "this su(2 ) symmetry is shown to be the spin rotation symmetry of a simply - connected lattice , so it still holds for the case of nonzero on - site interaction . in contrary",

    "then for an on - site free system with the time reversal symmetry , it always possesses a su(2 ) symmetry , but the physics of the symmetry depends on the underlying topology of the network .",
    "in previous we have found that there is a su(2 ) symmetry in a spin - orbit coupling system obeys the time reversal symmetry when the electron - electron interaction is absent .",
