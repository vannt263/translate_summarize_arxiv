    "another possible signal of new physics is lorentz invariance violation in the neutrino sector .",
    "observed neutrino oscillations may originate from a combination of effects involving neutrino masses and lorentz invariance violation  @xcite .",
    "lorentz invariance is a fundamental symmetry in the standard model of particle physics .",
    "although present experiments have confirmed lorentz invariance to a good precision , it may be broken in the early universe when energies approach the planck scale . the standard model itself",
    "is believed to be a low - energy effective theory of an underlying unified theory .",
    "lorentz invariance violation has been explored in quantum gravity  @xcite , loop quantum gravity  @xcite , non - commutative field theory  @xcite , and doubly special relativity theory  @xcite .",
    "various searches for lorentz invariance violation have been performed with a wide range of systems  @xcite .",
    "recently , the cosmological consequences of neutrinos with the coleman - glashow type  @xcite dispersion relation have been studied in ref .",
    "as it can be expected , the lorentz - violating term affects not only the evolution of the cosmological background but also the behavior of the neutrino perturbations .",
    "the former changes the expansion rate prior to and during the epoch of photon - baryon decoupling , which alters heights of the first and second peaks of the cmb temperature power spectrum , while the latter alters the shape of the cmb power spectrum by changing neutrino propagation . since these two effects can be distinguished from a change in the total mass of neutrinos or in the effective number of extra relativistic species , cmb data have been proposed as a probe of lorentz invariance violation in the neutrino sector .",
    "the seven - year wmap data in combination with lower - redshift measurements of the expansion rate were used to put constraints on the lorentz - violating term  @xcite .    moreover , since the lorentz - violating term influences the abundances of the light elements by altering the energy density of the universe and weak reaction rates prior to and during the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) epoch , bbn provides a promising probe of lorentz invariance violation in the neutrino sector in the early universe  @xcite .",
    "in particular the bbn - predicted abundance of helium-4 is very sensitive to the lorentz - violating term .",
    "it is known that the primordial helium-4 abundance plays a non - negligible role at the recombination epoch because it has an influence on the number density of free electron .",
    "therefore , lorentz invariance violation affects the cmb power spectrum by changing the bbn - predicted abundance of helium-4 . a reasonable way to test lorentz invariance violation in the neutrino sector with cmb data is to take account of the bbn - predicted helium-4 abundance as a prior rather than fixing the helium-4 abundance .    in this paper",
    "we investigate constraints on lorentz invariance violation in the neutrino sector from a joint analysis of bbn and cmb . in combination with the latest measurement of the primordial helium-4 abundance ,",
    "the planck 2015 data of the cmb anisotropies give a strong constraint on the deformation parameter .",
    "adding the primordial helium measurement can break effectively the degeneracy between the deformation parameter and the physical dark matter density .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s : deformation ]",
    "we parameterize lorentz invariance violation in the neutrino sector . in section  [",
    "s : bbn ] , we derive the weak reaction rates in the lorentz - violating extension of the standard model and calculate the bbn prediction of the helium-4 abundance . in section  [ s : perturbation ] , we derive the boltzmann equation for neutrinos in the synchronous gauge and calculate the cmb power spectrum .",
    "in section  [ s : constraints ] , we place constraints on the deformation parameter using the planck 2015 data in combination with the latest measurement of the primordial helium-4 abundance .",
    "section  [ s : conclusion ] is devoted to conclusions .",
    "at a phenomenological level , the deformed dispersion relation can be characterized by a power series of momentum . in this paper",
    ", we consider a simple instance of the dispersion relation for neutrinos constructed in  @xcite , which can be paramterized as follows @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the neutrino energy , @xmath4 the neutrino mass , @xmath5 the magnitude of the 3-momentum , and @xmath6 the deformation parameter characterizing the lorentz symmetry violation .    in the spatially - flat friedmann - lemaintre - robertson - walker metric with the scale factor @xmath7 , the number density @xmath8 , energy density @xmath9 and pressure @xmath10 for neutrinos with   are given by @xmath11 the phase space distribution for neutrinos is @xmath12^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath13 is the number of spin degrees of freedom , @xmath14 the neutrino temperature today , @xmath15 the magnitude of the comoving 3-momentum , and @xmath16 the comoving energy .",
    "the abundances of the light elements produced during the bbn epoch depend on the competition between the nuclear and weak reaction rates and the expansion rate of the universe . in the standard cosmological scenario and in the framework of the electroweak standard model , the dynamics of this phase",
    "is controlled by only one free parameter , the baryon to photon number density .",
    "we consider @xmath17 species of nuclides whose abundances @xmath18 are the number densities @xmath19 normalized with respect to the baryon number density @xmath20 , @xmath21 their evolutions are ruled by the following boltzmann equations , @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the reaction rate and @xmath24 is the number of nuclide @xmath25 involved in the reaction .    in the case of lorentz invariance violation in the neutrino sector , the changes of the reaction rates of the following weak reactions have to be taken into account .",
    "@xmath26 which determine the neutron - to - proton ratio when the baryons become uncoupled from the leptons .",
    "the abundances of the light elements depend on the neutron - to - proton ratio at the onset of bbn .",
    "as an example , let us compute the reaction rate of the process   in the lorentz - violating extension of the standard model  @xcite .",
    "the reaction rate is  @xcite @xmath27\\left(1+\\xi\\right)^{-3/2}\\gamma^{\\left(0\\right)}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the vector and axial coupling of the nucleon , @xmath30 is the standard reaction rate per incident nucleon derived in ref .",
    "the first prefactor on the right - hand side of eq .   arises from the neutrino propagator and the @xmath31 coupling in the lorentz - violating extension of standard model .",
    "the second prefactor comes from the statistical distribution for neutrinos . as for the other processes in - , their reaction rates can be simply derived by properly changing the statistical factors and the delta function determined by the energy conservation for each reaction .",
    "therefore , the corrections to the conversion rate of neutron into proton and its inverse rate are the same as in  .    in order to calculate the abundance of the light elements produced during the bbn epoch , we modified the publicly available parthenope code  @xcite to appropriately incorporate the lorentz - violating term in the neutrino sector .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , the bbn - predicted abundance of helium-4 is sensitive to the deformed parameter @xmath6 due to the fact that it is mainly determined by the neutron - to - proton ratio , which is related to the weak reaction rate , neutrino number density and expansion rate of the universe . in our analysis",
    "we shall focus on the helium-4 abundance that influences the cmb power spectrum .",
    "the lorentz - violating term affects not only the evolution of the cosmological background but also the behavior of the neutrino perturbations . following ref .",
    "@xcite we shall derive the boltzmann equation of the distribution function for neutrinos with   to linear order in the perturbations . in the synchronous gauge ,",
    "the perturbed energy density @xmath32 , pressure @xmath33 , energy flux @xmath34 , and shear stress @xmath35 are , respectively , given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the expansion coefficients of the perturbed neutrino distribution function expanded in a series of legendre polynomials @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the conformal time .",

    "therefore , the measurements of the cmb anisotropies provide a cosmological probe of lorentz invariance violation in the neutrino sector .",
    "it is known that variances in the helium-4 abundance modify the density of free electrons between helium and hydrogen recombination and therefore influence the cmb power spectrum .",
