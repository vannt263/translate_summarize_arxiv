    "axelrod s model of social dynamics was introduced to explore the mechanisms behind the persistence of cultural differences in a society @xcite .",
    "the agents are represented by strings of cultural features of length @xmath0 , where each feature can adopt a certain number @xmath1 of distinct traits .",
    "the interaction between any two agents takes place with probability proportional to their cultural similarity , i.e. , proportional to the number of traits they have in common .",
    "the analysis of this model by the statistical physics community has revealed a rich dynamic behavior with a nonequilibrium phase transition separating the culturally heterogeneous from the culturally homogeneous regime @xcite .",
    "an interesting characteristic of axelrod s model , which sets it apart from most lattice models that exhibit nonequilibrium phase transitions @xcite , is that all stationary states of the dynamics are absorbing states , i.e. , the dynamics always freezes in one of these states @xcite .",
    "in fact , according to the rules of axelrod s model , two neighboring agents who do not have any cultural trait in common can not interact and the interaction between agents who share all their cultural traits does not result in any change . hence at the stationary state we can guarantee that any pair of neighbors are either identical or completely different regarding their cultural features .",
    "this allows us to easily identify the stationary regime , which is a major problem in the characterization of nonequilibrium phase transitions @xcite . the problem , however , is that the dynamics can take a very large time to freeze to a homogeneous configuration for some initial conditions @xcite , which is the main reason there are so few numerical estimates of the transition lines of the phase diagram of axelrod s model @xcite .",
    "from the perspective of the statistical physics , the appealing feature of axelrod s model in a lattice of dimension @xmath2 is the existence of a threshold value @xmath3 with @xmath4 below which the stationary regime is monocultural ( i.e. , spatially homogeneous ) and above which multicultural ( i.e. , spatially heterogeneous ) .",
    "this result holds true for both the two - dimensional @xcite and the one - dimensional @xcite versions of axelrod s model .",
    "we recall that the sources of disorder in this model are the stochastic update sequence and the choice of the initial configuration : it is the competition between the disorder of the initial configuration and the ordering bias of the local interactions that is responsible for the nontrivial threshold phenomenon .",
    "the introduction of an external global field to influence the agents beliefs aiming at modeling the effect of the mass media @xcite resulted in a surprisingly difficult and controversial problem since the external field favored the heterogeneous instead of the homogeneous regime as one would naively expect ( see @xcite for an explanation of this finding ) .",
    "in addition , a considerable amount of effort has been devoted to searching for a threshold on the intensity of the media influence such that above that threshold , the community is multicultural and below it , the community is mono - cultural ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we have shown , however , that this threshold is an artifact of finite lattices , and that even a vanishingly small media influence is sufficient to produce cultural diversity in a region of the parameters space where the homogeneous regime is dominant in the absence of the media @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address another curious finding regarding the effect of the media ( or external field ) in axelrod s model : if the control parameters are such that the stationary regime is multicultural at zero field , then turning the field on will lead to a homogeneous state in the limit of vanishingly small field intensity @xcite . here",
    "we argue that this claim is not correct and that the multicultural regime remains multicultural , though with a reduced cultural diversity , regardless of the intensity of the global external field . by global field",
    "we mean a field that is spatially uniform ( i.e. , it is the same for all agents ) although not necessarily time independent @xcite .    over and above the re - examination of far - out claims on the effect of external fields in axelrod s model , in this contribution we show that the effect of the media in the one - dimensional model is qualitatively identical to the two - dimensional model , which has been the sole focus of systematic analyses up to now ( see @xcite for the study of the media - free one - dimensional axelrod s model ) .",
    "since simulations of the one - dimensional model are fast we will use their results as clues to expose the properties of the stationary state of the two - dimensional model in the computationally prohibitive regime of large lattices .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we briefly present the basic elements of axelrod s model and describe the different types of external global fields ( media ) we study in this paper . in section [ sec:1d ]",
    "we show the results of the simulations for the one - dimensional model in the two cases of interest , namely , when the media - free absorbing configurations are homogeneous and when they are heterogeneous . in the first case , we show that , similarly to the two - dimensional version @xcite , even a vanishingly small field intensity is sufficient to break up the homogeneous steady state . in the second case we show that the external field reduces the number of cultural domains but the steady state remains heterogeneous , regardless of the field strength .",
    "this conclusion is corroborated by the simulations of the two - dimensional model described in section [ sec:2d ] .",
    "a different type of field  a spatially non - uniform field that implements the consensus or majority rule among the neighborhood of the agents  is discussed in a separate section because it can not be interpreted as a media and produces results completely distinct from the spatially uniform fields ( see section [ sec : disc ] ) .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conc ] we summarize our main findings and present our concluding remarks .",
    "in the original formulation of axelrod s model @xcite , which we will adhere to here , each agent is characterized by a set of @xmath0 cultural features which can take on @xmath1 distinct values . in the two - dimensional version ,",
    "the agents are fixed in the sites of a square lattice of linear size @xmath5 with free boundary conditions ( i.e. , agents in the corners of the lattice interact with two neighbors , agents in the sides with three , and agents in the bulk with four nearest neighbors ) , whereas in the one - dimensional variant the agents are fixed in the sites of a chain of length @xmath5 with the same boundary conditions . from our perspective , the advantage of using free boundary conditions is the easy of implementing hoshen and kopelman algorithm for counting the number of clusters in a lattice @xcite , but since we are interested in the properties of the steady state for very large lattice sizes , the choice of the boundary conditions is largely irrelevant for axelrod s model .",
    "the initial configuration is completely random with the features of each agent given by random integers drawn uniformly between @xmath6 and @xmath1 . at each time",
    "we pick an agent at random  the target agent  as well as one of its neighbors .",
    "these two agents interact with probability equal to their cultural similarity , defined as the fraction of common cultural features .",
    "an interaction consists of selecting at random one of the distinct features , and making the selected feature of the target agent equal to its neighbor s corresponding trait .",
    "this procedure is repeated until the system is frozen into an absorbing configuration .",
    "thus axelrod s model can be viewed as @xmath0 coupled voter models @xcite .",
    "the introduction of an external field or global media in the standard model follows the ingenious suggestion of adding a virtual agent which interacts with all agents in the lattice and whose cultural traits reflect the media message @xcite . in the original version , each cultural feature of the virtual agent has the trait which is the most common in the population  the consensus opinion .",
    "henceforth we will refer to this type of external field as the consensus field .",
    "the second type of field we consider is constant in time , i.e. , the media message is fixed from the outset , so it really models some alien influence impinging on the population .",
    "we will refer to this field as the static field .",
    "explicitly , we generate the culture vector of the virtual agent at random and keep it fixed during the dynamics @xcite .",
    "( these two types of field were referred to as global and external media by ref .",
    "@xcite , but since both fields are global and external here we opt to use a more informative nomenclature . )    regardless of the type of external field , the interaction of the media ( virtual agent ) with the real agents is governed by the control parameter @xmath7 $ ] , which may be interpreted as a measure of the strength of the external field influence . as in the original axelrod s model , we begin by choosing a target agent at random , but now it can interact with the media with probability @xmath8 or with its neighbors with probability @xmath9 .",
    "since we have defined the media as a virtual agent , the interaction follows exactly the same rules as before .",
    "the media - free model is recovered by setting @xmath10 .",
    "because of the unusually large times needed for some initial configurations to relax to a homogeneous absorbing configuration  relaxation to heterogeneous configurations is typically very fast  the simulation of the dynamics of axelrod s model must be made as efficient as possible . in our simulations",
    "we consider two lists of active bounds . the first list ( list @xmath11 )",
    "is composed by the active bounds that connect real agents , whereas the second list ( list @xmath12 ) contains the active bounds that connect the virtual agent ( media ) with the real ones . in both cases ,",
    "an active bound is defined as a bound that connects two agents that have at least one feature in common and at least one feature distinct from each other . here instead of picking the target agent at random we first select one of the two lists  list @xmath11 with probability @xmath9 and list @xmath12 with probability @xmath8  and then pick a bound at random from the selected list . in case of a bound from list @xmath12 , the target agent is of course the real one but if the bound belongs to list @xmath11 we choose the target agent at random from the two options . in the case that the cultural features of the target agent are modified by the interaction with its neighbor ,",
    "we need to re - examine the active / inactive status of all bounds associated to the target agent so as to update the lists of active bounds .",
    "the dynamics is frozen when the two lists of active bounds are emptied .",
    "in the attempt to make axelrod s model more ` realistic ' , researchers have studied the model in a variety of complex networks ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , with the usual result that the multicultural regime is destabilized by the increase of the connectivity of the network and so the stationary regime is homogeneous regardless of the values of the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "it is curious that the simple one - dimensional variant that preserves the phase transition @xcite received comparatively almost no attention . in this section",
    "we show that the effect of external fields is essentially the same in one and two dimensions as far as the favoring of the homogeneous or heterogeneous is concerned .",
    "the dimensionality introduces some distinctive effects , however , as we discuss next .",
    "we begin our analysis with the once puzzling situation in which the homogeneous media - free stationary regime becomes heterogeneous under the influence of the external media @xcite .",
    "since this problem was extensively studied in the two - dimensional lattice @xcite we present here only a brief analysis of the effect of the static media , aiming at highlighting the similarities and differences between the one and two - dimensional results .    to characterize the steady state of axelrod s model we focus on two basic statistical measures , namely , the normalized average number of domains @xmath13 and the average relative size of the domains that do not belong to the largest domain @xmath14 .",
    "these quantities are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] together with the fraction of runs trapped into homogeneous absorbing configuration @xmath15 .",
    "a domain or cluster is a bounded region in which all agents share the same culture .",
    "we note that in this figure , as well as in the next figures of this paper , the statistical error bars are smaller or at most equal to the symbol sizes . typically , each symbol represents the result of the average over @xmath16 to @xmath17 independent runs of the stochastic dynamics .",
    "the first point to note is the remarkable similarity between the results presented in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] for the one - dimensional and those for the two - dimensional model @xcite . for a fixed finite value of @xmath5",
    "there seems to exist a threshold value for the media strength @xmath18 below which the regime is mono - cultural @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath15 shown in the middle panel illustrates this somewhat odd predominance of the homogeneous absorbing configurations , in which the agents are identical to the static media , for lattices of intermediate size and small @xmath8 ( the case @xmath10 is discussed below ) .",
    "however , as illustrated in the figure this ` threshold ' decreases with increasing @xmath5 and so it is a finite size effect .",
    "thus our conclusion is that in the thermodynamic limit even a vanishingly small field is sufficient to break up the mono - cultural regime .",
    "more pointedly , extrapolating the ratio @xmath19 ( upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) for @xmath20 and plotting the result against @xmath8 in a log - log graph yields @xmath21 in the limit @xmath22 .",
    "the middle and lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] reveal some remarkable differences between the one and two - dimensional models .",
    "firstly , for @xmath10 only about 35% of the samples ( random initial configurations ) ended up into strictly homogeneous absorbing configurations , whereas for the two - dimensional model this happens for all samples in the homogeneous regime .",
    "the reason we keep referring to this regime as the homogeneous regime is that the order parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 take on values compatible with a homogeneous phase .",
    "this only happens because the heterogeneous absorbing configurations are composed of a single macroscopic domain together with a non - extensive number of microscopic domains .",
    "hence the probability that a randomly chosen site in such configuration belongs to the largest domain is @xmath6 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "secondly and more importantly , in the two - dimensional model the fraction of the sites that are not part of the largest domain ( the media in that case ) is finite and approaches zero for @xmath25 @xcite , whereas in the one - dimensional model that fraction tends to unity regardless of the field strength @xmath26 .",
    "this means that the effect of the field in one - dimension is quite extreme ",
    "a vanishingly small field is enough to completely destroy the uniform regime , producing a fragmented configuration composed of microscopic domains .",
    "( we know that the domains are microscopic because @xmath27 in the thermodynamic limit . )",
    "this result is probably a consequence of the ` weakness ' of the uniform regime at @xmath10 discussed above .",
    "we turn now to the problem that motivated this paper , namely , the claim that the effect of a vanishingly small external field is to turn the field - free heterogeneous steady state into a field - induced homogeneous state in the limit @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "this result would then be analogous to the homogenizing effect of an external noise that changes traits at random with some small probability @xcite . alas",
    ", we find no evidence of such mind - boggling effect neither in the one nor in the two dimensional axelrod s model .",
    "actually , the original small - lattice simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite do not seem to support the existence of such phenomenon either ( see sect .",
    "[ sec:2d ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we show the average number of domains for both static ( upper panel ) and consensus ( lower panel ) media .",
    "we use filled symbols to display the results for the two extreme values of the field intensity ( @xmath10 and @xmath28 ) , and unfilled symbols for the intermediary field strengths .",
    "this figure exhibits many noticeable results .",
    "the number of domains is maximum in the case only interactions with the field are permitted ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "allowance of local interactions between neighboring agents results in less heterogeneous configurations , as expected .",
    "the surprise is that , even for finite @xmath5 , the average number of domains jumps to a lower value as @xmath8 departs infinitesimally from unity ( the same phenomenon happens in the two - dimensional model @xcite ) .",
    "although @xmath29 exhibits a smooth dependence on @xmath30 we observe another jump ( now to a higher diversity value ) at @xmath10 .",
    "the fact that these jumps occur at any finite value of @xmath5 implies that the heterogeneous absorbing configurations are unstable to single - site changes .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the fact that the number of domains ( and the diversity , as well ) are reduced when the field or the local interactions are turned on . put differently ,",
    "the number of domains decreases ( discontinuously ) from @xmath10 to @xmath31 as well as from @xmath28 to @xmath32 .",
    "we note that for @xmath28 the consensus media is fixed with the traits reflecting the consensus values for the random initial configuration of the agents .",
    "however , for finite @xmath5 the results differ somewhat significantly from those of the static media ( see fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "why is that ?",
    "the reason is that the traits of the static media are chosen randomly and independently of the also random initial traits of the agents , whereas in the case of the consensus media the media traits are not independent from the agents traits , being given by the majority rule .",
    "this correlation has a strong effect for small chains but becomes irrelevant for large @xmath5 since in this case the fraction of agents that share a given media trait is not much greater than @xmath33 , which is the expected value of this fraction for the static media .",
    "in fact , the correlation between the media and the agents in the initial configuration explains the dips observed in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] for @xmath34 since it decreases the number of agents with antagonistic traits with respect to the media , resulting in less fragmented configurations than in the case the media traits are set randomly .",
    "however , as pointed before , this effect disappears for large chains .",
    "the discontinuities at @xmath10 and @xmath28 are more easily visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] where we present the extrapolation to infinite chain sizes , @xmath35 , of the results exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "the results for both types of media are practically indistinguishable . for @xmath25",
    "we find @xmath36 whereas @xmath37 for @xmath38 , which are valid for both media types ( see the legend of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] for the values of @xmath39 at @xmath10 and @xmath28 ) .",
    "the important point here is that the data offer no evidence whatsoever that @xmath39 would vanish in the limit @xmath25 as claimed by ref .",
    "@xcite for the two - dimensional model .",
    "we should emphasize that the decrease on the number of domains induced by a vanishingly small field is the expected outcome of the assay , since the small field destabilizes some of the field - free domains , but lacks the strength to create new field - induced domains .     of the normalized number of domains in the one - dimensional model for the static ( circles ) and consensus ( triangle ) media as function of the field strength @xmath8 .",
    "at @xmath10 we find @xmath40 and at @xmath28 we find @xmath41 for both media types .",

    "these findings are similar to those reported for the majority - vote model @xcite .",
    "we turn now to the study of the two - dimensional axelrod s model , which is considerably more computationally demanding than the analysis of the one - dimensional version presented before .",
    "the effect of external fields on the field - free homogeneous regime is well - understood by now @xcite : the results are similar to those exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] except for the relative size of the largest domain which in the limit @xmath25 tends to @xmath6 in the two - dimensional case @xcite and to @xmath46 in the one -dimensional version ( lower panel of fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "hence we will consider here only the effect of external fields on the field - free heterogeneous regime .",
    "moreover , we focus most our efforts on the parameter set @xmath47 and @xmath48 rather than on the set @xmath49 and @xmath50 of ref .  @xcite . in both cases",
    "the field - free ( @xmath10 ) regime is heterogeneous , but simulations using our parameter selection are much faster of course .",

    "we present the dependence of the average number of domains on the linear size of the square lattice .",
    "the results are qualitatively similar to those obtained for the one - dimensional model and summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "the correlation between the consensus media and the agents results in less heterogeneous absorbing configurations in comparison with the configurations induced by the static media , but this difference becomes negligible as the lattice size increases .",
    "this correlation effect is less dramatic than in the one - dimensional model because for the same value of @xmath5 in the x - axis there are many more agents ( @xmath51 to be precise ) in the two - dimensional lattice .",

    "in our effort to clarify the effects of spatially uniform fields ( interpreted as mass media ) as well as of nonuniform fields on axelrod s model we have unveiled several interesting and unsuspected features of this well studied model of social influence .",
    "first and foremost , we have debunked the claim that in the thermodynamic limit the field - free heterogeneous regime becomes homogeneous in the limit of vanishingly small fields , i.e. , @xmath25 regardless of the type of the field @xcite .",
    "more pointedly , we find that in the presence of a local field the steady state does indeed become homogeneous but for all @xmath68 .",
    "this is hardly a surprise since the local field implements a majority - vote rule among the nearest neighbors of the target agent and so , when allied to the homogenizing interaction rule of axelrod s model , it constitutes an insuperable force towards homogenization .",
    "however , we find that the system remains heterogeneous in the presence of the spatially uniform fields which were originally introduced in axelrod s model to study the effect of mass media on opinion formation @xcite .",
    "second , we find that the spatially uniform but time - varying consensus media introduced in @xcite and the static media yield the same results in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it seems the reason they produce different outcomes for small lattices is the correlation between the consensus field and the agents in the random initial configuration .",
    "this correlation becomes less pronounced for large lattices since even after application of the consensus rule there will be a rough balance between the values of the traits of a same entry of the feature vector . from the statistical mechanics perspective , this is an important result because it allows us to make inferences about a more realistic media type using the much easier to simulate static media .",
    "third , we find that the heterogeneous absorbing configurations at @xmath10 and @xmath28 are unstable .",
    "this instability is reflected by the discontinuities that take place at those values even for finite lattices . otherwise , the measures used to describe the steady state ",
    "average number of domains and size of the largest domain  are continuous functions of @xmath8 in the range @xmath68 .",
    "we note that the field - free homogeneous configurations for finite @xmath5 are stable in both one and two dimensions .",
    "however , in the thermodynamic limit they become unstable in one dimension ( lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) but remain stable in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "fourth , we find that the one - dimensional version of axelrod s model @xcite yields essentially the same results as the more popular two - dimensional version .",
    "in particular , our findings about the impact of the three field types on the field - free heterogeneous regime of the two - dimensional model were corroborated by the one - dimensional model .",
    "although this model exhibits some peculiarities , which were properly highlighted in the text , it can serve as an exceptional guide to our understanding of features that are difficult to unveil in the two - dimensional version , such as the effect of local fields .    the characterization of the absorbing configurations of axelrod s model in the thermodynamic limit , regardless of whether or not in the presence of a field ( media ) , remains a challenge to statistical mechanics .",
    "in fact , we do not know much about the location and the nature of the phase transition in the @xmath76 space @xcite , due mainly to the huge relaxation times the dynamics needs to settle in a homogeneous configurations , which grows as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the number of lattice sites @xcite . in that sense",
    ", the appearance of dubitable claims about the behavior of axelrod s model in the thermodynamic limit should not be surprising .",
    "this situation is worsened by the presence of a field since lattices of intermediate sizes exhibit somewhat perversely a regime distinct from the thermodynamic one ( see fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , we think that we have reached by now a good qualitative understanding of the effects of spatially uniform ( mass media ) as well as nonuniform ( local ) fields on the statistical properties of the two - dimensional axelrod model . in the field - free homogeneous regime case , the presence of a vanishingly small field ( i.e. , @xmath79 ) leads to the breaking of the single mono - cultural domain into a macroscopic domain ( media ) and a multitude of microscopic domains which occupy a finite area of the lattice @xcite .",
    "the scenario is different in the one - dimensional model where the field pulverizes the giant domain into microscopic domains as shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "regarding the field - free heterogeneous regime case , which was our main concern in this paper , the presence of a spatially uniform field does not produce cultural homogenization , regardless of the field strength @xmath8 . in contrast , a local field that implements the majority - vote rule among the neighbors of the target agent leads to a homogeneous steady state for @xmath32 ."
