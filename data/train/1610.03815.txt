    "in the course of the study of graphite and a graphite monolayer , called graphene , understanding of the symmetries of the electron dispersion law in graphene was of crucial importance . actually , the symmetry classification of the energy bands in graphene was presented nearly 60 years ago by lomer in his seminal paper @xcite .",
    "later the subject was analyzed by slonczewski and weiss @xcite , dresselhaus and dresselhaus @xcite , bassani and parravicini @xcite , malard et al @xcite , manes @xcite and others .    in our previous publication",
    "@xcite we compared the classification of the electron bands in graphene , obtained by group theory algebra in the framework of a tight - binding model ( tbm ) , with that calculated in a density - functional - theory ( dft ) local - density approximation framework .",
    "identification in the dft band structure of all eight energy bands ( four valence and four conduction bands ) corresponding to the tbm - derived energy bands was performed and the corresponding analysis was presented . the four occupied ( three @xmath1 -like and one @xmath2 -like ) and three unoccupied ( two @xmath1 -like and one @xmath2 -like ) bands given by the dft closely correspond to those predicted by the tbm , both by their symmetry and their dispersion law .",
    "however , the two lowest lying at the @xmath0-point unoccupied bands ( one of them of a @xmath1 -like type and the other of a @xmath2-like one ) , were found to be not of the tbm type in accord with the earlier publications@xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bands ] we reproduce the results of the band structure calculations with symmetry labelling of the occupied and the lowest lying unoccupied bands . the tbm bands are plotted in solid lines , @xmath1 non - tbm band - in long dashed , @xmath2 non - tbm band - in dotted line .",
    "to understand the symmetry classification of the bands one should remember that the group of wave vector @xmath3 at the @xmath0 point is @xmath4 ; at the @xmath5 point  @xmath6 ; at the point @xmath7  @xmath8 .",
    "the group of wave vector @xmath3 at each of the lines constituting triangle @xmath9 is @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite representations of the groups can be found in the book by landau and lifshitz @xcite .",
    "honeycomb lattice and its brillouine zone with the symmetry points are presented on fig .",
    "[ fig : bandsn ] .",
    "one of rotations @xmath11 for the @xmath4 group is about the direction @xmath12 .",
    "rotation @xmath13 for the @xmath8 group is about the normal to graphene plane , rotation @xmath14 - about the @xmath15 line .",
    "reflection @xmath16 for the @xmath10 groups is relative to the plane of graphene .",
    "the mathematical details of the symmetry analysis in tbm are presented in section [ tbm ] .",
    "the difference between the tbm and non - tbm states is evident from the figures in our previous publication @xcite presenting electron density .",
    "the former are localized in the vicinity of graphene plane within a distance of the order of graphene lattice constant @xmath17 .",
    "the latter are localized within a distance @xmath18 , where @xmath19 .",
    "it means that while calculating the dispersion law with its typical energy scale @xmath20 ev , for the non - tbm bands in zero order approximation with respect to parameter @xmath21 we can ignore the @xmath22 dependence of the wave functions .",
    "in addition , when looking on fig . [",
    "fig : bands ] one notices that the dispersion of the two non - tbm bands follow very closely the continuum bottom lines , which present the dispersion law of the free electrons , staying below them .",
    "hence we can formulate a minimalistic model for the non - tbm bands by considering them as ( nearly ) free electrons model ( fem ) bands , more specifically by presenting their wave functions in the factorised form @xmath23 where @xmath24 are ( nearly ) free electron wave functions corresponding to the continuum bottom , and the functions @xmath25 are determined by the boundary conditions @xmath26 for the @xmath1 band @xmath25 is an even function , and for the @xmath2 band  an odd one .",
    "the multiplier @xmath25 would give a first order with respect to parameter @xmath21 negative correction to the dispersion of the fem bands , putting them slightly below the continuum bottom .",
    "however , for the symmetry analysis presented below , this multiplier is irrelevant , apart from the fact of its parity , the former distinguishing between @xmath1 and @xmath2 band .    according to the nearly - free - electron model ,",
    "the wave functions of the states inside the brillouin zone are just plane waves . on the boundaries of the zone they are combinations of small number of plane",
    "waves @xcite .",
    "thus , on the lines @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xmath29 ; on the line @xmath30 , @xmath24 is an arbitrary linear combinations of two plane waves : @xmath31 and the other one , corresponding to the equivalent point on the opposite edge of the hexagon , forming the boundary of the brillouin zone ; at the point @xmath5 , @xmath32 is a linear combination of three plane waves @xmath33 corresponding to the three equivalent vertices of the hexagon @xmath34 .",
    "our assumption allows to derive the symmetry realized by each of the two bands from the symmetry of plane waves with respect to rotations and reflections in the plane ( and the symmetry of the function @xmath25 with respect to reflection in the @xmath35 plane ) .",
    "thus we immediately obtain that at the point @xmath0 , the @xmath1 band realizes representation @xmath36 , and the @xmath2  representation @xmath37 . at the lines @xmath27 and @xmath28 , the @xmath1 band realizes representation @xmath38 , and the @xmath2 ",
    "representation @xmath39 .    at the line @xmath40",
    "the function @xmath41 ( sum of the exponents ) realizes @xmath42 representation of @xmath10 for even @xmath25 , and @xmath43 representation for odd @xmath25 ; the function @xmath41 ( difference of the exponents ) realizes @xmath44 representation for even @xmath25 , and @xmath45 representation for odd @xmath25 .",
    "one can expect that the two bands considered correspond to symmetric combinations of the plane waves .",
    "at the point @xmath7 the function @xmath41 ( sum of the exponents ) realizes @xmath46 representation of @xmath8 for even @xmath25 , and @xmath47 representation for odd @xmath25 ; the function @xmath41 ( difference of the exponents ) realizes @xmath48 representation of @xmath8 for even @xmath25 , and @xmath49 representation for odd @xmath25 .",
    "again , one can expect that the two bands considered would correspond to symmetric combinations of the plane waves .",
    "to expand the representation realized by the plane waves at the point @xmath5 we may use equation @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 shows how many times an irreducible representation @xmath52 of the group ( in our case @xmath6 ) occurs in the expansion , @xmath53 is the number of elements in the group , @xmath54 is an arbitrary element of the group , @xmath55 is the character of the element in the origional representation , and @xmath56 is the character of the element in the irreducible representation @xmath52 .",
    "taking into account the table of the characters of the irreducible representations of the group @xmath6 we get that at the point @xmath5 the functions @xmath57 realize @xmath58 representation of @xmath6 for even @xmath25 , and @xmath59 representation for odd @xmath25 @xcite . more specifically , according to the fem @xcite , in the vicinity of the k point there are 3 @xmath1 and 3 @xmath2 bands which are linear combinations of the 3 plane waves , corresponding to the equivalent vertices of the brillouine zone hexagon ( multiplied by the appropriate @xmath25 functions .",
    "judging by the band structure presented on fig .",
    "[ fig : bands ] , in each case two upper bands are high in the continuum , and the lower one is below the continuum bottom .",
    "the fem @xmath1 states in the vicinity of the k point are hybridized with the tbm @xmath1 states .",
    "thus the @xmath60 representation of the unoccupied bands is realized by the states of both types @xcite ( see also the next section ) .",
    "on the other hand , the fem @xmath2 states in the vicinity of the k point have no tbm counterparts , to hybridize with .",
    "however , the lower fem band in the vicinity of the k point is repelled by the upper bands .",
    "( formally , the upper bands exist all over the brillouine zone , but they come close to the lower one only in the vicinity of the @xmath5 point . )",
    "this explains why the fem @xmath2 band deviates from the bottom of the continuum there .",
    "the first attempt to apply the tbm to the calculation of the electrons dispersion law in graphene ( graphite ) was done already in 1935 by f. hund and b. mrowka @xcite .    here",
    "we want to expand the symmetry analysis in the framework of the tbm from our previous publications @xcite .",
    "we look for the solution of the schrdinger equation as a linear combination of the functions @xmath61 where @xmath62 are atomic orbitals , @xmath63 labels the sub - lattices , and @xmath64 is the radius vector of an atom in the sublattice @xmath65 .",
    "our tbm space includes four atomic orbitals : @xmath66 .",
    "( notice that we assume only symmetry of the basis functions with respect to rotations and reflections ; the question how these functions are related to the atomic functions of the isolated carbon atom is irrelevant . )",
    "the hamiltonian of graphene being symmetric with respect to reflection in the graphene plane , the bands built from the @xmath67 orbitals decouple from those built from the @xmath68 orbitals .",
    "the former are odd with respect to reflection , the latter are even . in other words , the former form @xmath2 bands , and the latter form @xmath1 bands .",
    "a symmetry transformation of the functions @xmath69 is a direct product of two transformations : the transformation of the sub - lattice functions @xmath70 , where @xmath71 and the transformation of the orbitals @xmath72 .",
    "thus the representations realized by the functions ( [ tb ] ) will be the direct product of two representations .",
    "let us start from the most symmetrical point @xmath0 .",
    "the functions @xmath73 realize @xmath74 representation of the group @xmath4 .",
    "the orbital @xmath75 realizes @xmath36 representation of the group , @xmath67 realizes @xmath37 representation , the orbitals @xmath76 realize @xmath77 representation .",
    "the identitity @xmath78 specifies the two @xmath1 bands constructed from @xmath75 orbitals ; the identity @xmath79 specifies the two @xmath2 bands constructed from @xmath67 orbitals ; the identity @xmath80 shows that there are two merging points of the @xmath1 bands constructed from @xmath81 orbitals .",
    "( [ g1 ] ) - ( [ g3 ] ) explain why the band @xmath82 lies below the corresponding @xmath83 band , and the degeneracy of the bands corresponding to @xmath84 representation occurs below of those corresponding to the @xmath85 representation .",
    "in fact , the symmetry of the band(s ) with respect to exchange of the lattice sites ( the higher symmetry corresponding to the lower band @xcite ) can be deduced from the symmetry of the representation realized by @xmath86 .",
    "now consider the point @xmath5 .",
    "the functions @xmath87 realize @xmath60 representation of the group @xmath6 .",
    "the orbitals @xmath75 and @xmath67 realize @xmath88 and @xmath89 representations respectively , the orbitals @xmath76 realize @xmath60 representation . the product of the representations is expanded as @xmath90 ( notice that @xmath91 is the symmetric product of the representation on itself ( including , of course , the absolutely symmetric representation @xmath38 and @xmath92 is the antisymmetric product @xcite . ) taking into account these identities , we obtain a band realizing @xmath88 representation and that realizing @xmath92 representation , constructed from @xmath76 orbitals , two merging points realizing @xmath60 representations , each of them constructed from @xmath68 orbitals and the merging point realizing @xmath93 representation , constructed from @xmath67 orbitals .    on figs .",
    "[ fig:3k ] -[fig:9k ] we present the results of the calculations of the wave functions of the non degenerate bands at the point @xmath5 .",
    "the wave functions of the @xmath1 bands are plotted at the plane @xmath35 . for the @xmath2 band ,",
    "the wave function is identically equal to zero at the @xmath35 plane , so we plotted the wave function at the plane @xmath94 a.u .",
    "all the figures are consistent with the assignments made in fig .",
    "[ fig : bands ] .    -.5 cm    -.5 cm    -.5 cm    in our previous publication @xcite we presented simple tbm interpretation of the degeneracy of the @xmath2 bands at the point @xmath5 ( @xmath93 representation )",
    ". the general tbm hamiltonian for the @xmath2 bands is @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the energy of an isolated @xmath67 orbital , @xmath97 is an arbitrary lattice vector .",
    "the structure of graphene can be seen as a triangular lattice with a basis of two atoms per unit cell , displaced from each other by any one ( fixed ) vector @xmath98 connecting two sites of different sub - lattices . from ref .",
    "@xcite we get that @xmath97 is a linear combination of @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 can be chosen as @xmath102 .",
    "also @xmath103 .",
    "consider , for example , three terms in the sum @xmath104 corresponding to hopping between the nearest neighbours .",
    "the hopping integral @xmath105 is the same for all three terms ; the multiplier @xmath106 takes three values : @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",
    "hence , due to the identity @xmath109 , the non - diagonal terms in the hamiltonian ( [ hamz ] ) disappear ; hence degeneracy of the bands .",
    "similar interpretation can be supplied for the degeneracy of the @xmath1 bands at the k point .",
    "the reasoning from the previous paragraph can be repeated verbatim for the @xmath60 representation realized by @xmath110 and @xmath111 functions .",
