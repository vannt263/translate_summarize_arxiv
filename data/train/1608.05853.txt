    "thermonuclear reaction rates are at the heart of nuclear astrophysics .",
    "they are essential for understanding key phenomena in the universe , including main - sequence stars , red giants , agb stars , white dwarfs , core - collapse and thermonuclear supernovae , classical novae , and type i x - ray bursts .",
    "the evaluations provided by willy fowler and collaborators were of outstanding importance in this regard @xcite .",
    "their recommended _ experimental _ reaction rates provided , for the first time , a solid nuclear physics foundation for models of stars and big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "a further milestone was reached with the nacre collaboration @xcite .",
    "their work provided not only updated rates , but also included approximate reaction rate error estimates .",
    "these ideas were subsequently extended to heavier target nuclei and to reactions involving short - lived targets @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", a growing volume of astronomical data motivated an increased number of nucleosynthesis sensitivity studies to better quantify the impact of given reactions on nuclear burning .",
    "the first such reaction network studies utilized published recommended thermonuclear reaction rates together with somewhat arbitrary methods of varying the rates @xcite .",
    "it became apparent that improved experimental reaction rate estimates , based on sound statistical methods , would be very valuable .",
    "such experimental rates were first published in 2010 @xcite .",
    "they were obtained using monte carlo sampling of the many experimental nuclear physics input quantities ( e.g. , resonance energies and strengths , partial widths and reduced widths ) entering in a reaction rate calculation .",
    "the output of this procedure is a probability density for the reaction rate at each temperature of interest .",
    "the probability density is used to extract statistically meaningful rate estimates , such as a recommended rate ( from the median ) or rate uncertainties ( from the 16th and 84th percentiles for a 68% coverage probability ) .",
    "experimental monte carlo - based reaction rates are tabulated in the starlib reaction rate library @xcite and are publicly available .",
    "the starlib library has already been used in monte carlo nucleosynthesis studies of classical novae @xcite and in studies of globular cluster polluters @xcite .",
    "recently , starlib has been used with the mesa stellar evolution software instrument @xcite to study the impact of uncertainties in nuclear reaction rates on the properties of carbon - oxygen white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "experimental monte carlo - based thermonuclear reaction rates are so far available for @xmath5 ( p,@xmath0 ) , ( p,@xmath3 ) , and ( @xmath3,@xmath0 ) reactions in the @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 mass region , involving both stable and unstable target nuclei .",
    "the monte carlo - based method of estimating reaction rates is limited , in its present form , to nuclear reactions that are dominated by resonant contributions to the total rate .",
    "non - resonant contributions are included in the method @xcite , but their random sampling is only performed in the simplest possible manner by providing an approximate uncertainty of the non - resonant astrophysical s - factor . while this treatment of the non - resonant component is not statistically rigorous , it has little practical effect on the total rates for the reactions referred to above , precisely because they are dominated by resonant contributions .",
    "the calculation of non - resonant reaction rates directly from experimental data has its own difficulties and pitfalls .",
    "such rates have been estimated for @xmath9 light - particle reactions , in the @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath10 mass region , using the r - matrix reaction model and @xmath11 fits to the data for the purpose of studying big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "light - particle reaction rates , in the @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath12 mass range , have also been computed for solar models @xcite .",
    "the experimental data were analyzed in the latter work by @xmath11 minimization , using either a polynomial s - factor expansion or the output of theoretical nuclear reaction models .",
    "typical problems encountered in the analysis of non - resonant rates include the treatments of data normalization factor uncertainties ( i.e. , systematic errors ) and discrepant data sets . in a recent study of the cosmic evolution of deuterium @xcite , a number of different methods , all based on @xmath11 minimization ,",
    "have been employed to compute rates for the d(p,@xmath0)@xmath13he , d(d , n)@xmath13he , and d(d , p)@xmath1h reactions .    in this work",
    "we provide a fresh look by calculating the non - resonant reaction rates using bayesian probability theory .",
    "the advantages of this approach are manifold .",
    "first , the bayesian approach yields directly the quantity of interest in nucleosynthesis sensitivity studies , i.e. , the reaction rate probability density function .",
    "these rates can be easily implemented , together with the monte carlo - based rates discussed above , into the starlib rate library .",
    "second , the bayesian model provides a more consistent method for extracting information from measured data , even in ill - conditioned situations , compared to traditional statistics .    in section  [ sec : regression2 ]",
    ", we will discuss how to incorporate systematic uncertainties , robust regression , and non - gaussian statistical uncertainties into a bayesian analysis .",
    "bayesian astrophysical s - factors and thermonuclear rates for the d(p,@xmath0)@xmath1he , @xmath1he(@xmath1he,2p)@xmath2he , and @xmath1he(@xmath3,@xmath0)@xmath4be reactions are presented in sections  [ sec : sfactors ] and [ sec : rates ] , respectively .",
    "a summary and conclusions are provided in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "since bayesian inference has rarely been applied before to s - factors and reaction ratesbe(p,@xmath0)@xmath14b , see @xcite .",
    "] , we will discuss in appendix  [ sec : inference ] how to use bayes theorem to estimate model parameters . to clarify our discussion of bayesian s - factors and reaction rates in the main text ,",
    "these ideas are applied in appendix  [ sec : regression ] to the simple problem of linear regression .",
    "for the analysis of bayesian models , we will employ the program ` jags ` ( `` just another gibbs sampler '' ) using markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) sampling . more information on `",
    "jags ` , including a simple example , is provided in the appendices .",
    "before we can analyze astrophysical s - factor data using bayesian inference , we have to consider how to include systematic uncertainties , outliers , and non - gaussian statistical uncertainties in the likelihood function .",
    "experimental data are subject to statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "statistical uncertainties are well understood and they usually follow a known probability distribution , e.g. , a gaussian or poissonian .",
    "when a series of independent experiments is performed , statistical uncertainties will give rise to different results in each individual measurement .",
    "the magnitude of the statistical uncertainty can be estimated from the standard deviation of the data , if the experiments are uncorrelated .",
    "statistical effects can be reduced by combining the results from several measurements .",
    "systematic effects , on the other hand , do not usually signal their existence by a larger fluctuation of the data .",
    "when the experiment is repeated , the presence of systematic effects may not produce different answers .",
    "similarly , systematic uncertainties are frequently not reduced when combining the results from different measurements .",
    "reported systematic uncertainties are at least partially based on assumptions made by the experimenter , are model dependent , and follow vaguely known probability distributions @xcite .",
    "consider as an example the measurement of an astrophysical s - factor at a given bombarding energy .",
    "the experimental result is frequently reported as @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath16 @xmath18 , where @xmath15 is the mean value , @xmath17 is the standard deviation representing the statistical uncertainty , and @xmath18 denotes the systematic uncertainty .",
    "the latter two quantities are either reported as absolute or relative ( i.e. , percent ) uncertainties .",
    "if a single uncertainty is required , statistical and systematic uncertainties can be combined in quadrature on the grounds that they are uncorrelated . since a systematic effect",
    "will shift all points of a given data set in the same direction , it can either be quantified as an ( additive ) offset or a ( multiplicative ) normalization .",
    "the true value of the offset or normalization is , of course , unknown , otherwise there would be no systematic uncertainty . however , we do have one piece of information : the expectation value of the systematic uncertainty is zero , if the systematic effect is quantified as an offset , or unity , if it is described as a normalization .",
    "if this would not be the case , we would have corrected the data for the systematic effect .",
    "the s - factor data we will analyze in section  [ sec : sfactors ] have been reported with systematic uncertainties described by normalization factors .",
    "for example , suppose the systematic uncertainty for a given data set is reported as @xmath19 , implying that the normalization uncertainty is given by a factor of @xmath20 .",
    "a useful distribution for factor uncertainties is the lognormal probability density , given by @xmath21 it is characterized by two quantities , the location parameter , @xmath22 , and the spread parameter , @xmath23 .",
    "notice that @xmath22 and @xmath23 are not the mean and standard deviation of the lognormal distribution , but of the gaussian distribution for @xmath24 .",
    "the median value of the lognormal distribution is given by @xmath25 @xmath7 @xmath26 , while the factor uncertainty , for a coverage probability of 68% , is @xmath27 @xmath7 @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , we include in our bayesian model a systematic effect as a highly - informative , lognormal prior with a median of @xmath29 , i.e. , @xmath22 @xmath7 @xmath30 , and a factor uncertainty given by the systematic uncertainty , i.e. , in the above example , @xmath27 @xmath7 @xmath20 or @xmath23 @xmath7 @xmath31 . a specific example , including the syntax , for implementing systematic uncertainties into ` jags ` is given in appendix  [ sec : regression ] .",
    "outliers can bias the data analysis significantly if they are not properly taken into account .",
    "the frequently applied procedure of disregarding data points that are subjectively deemed to be outliers has no statistical justification .",
    "a number of different approaches have been applied in bayesian inference to include outliers in the analysis .",
    "for example , the data could be described by applying a distribution that has taller tails , such as the @xmath32 distribution @xcite , compared to the ubiquitous gaussian distribution .    in the present work ,",
    "we adopt a different approach that is based on @xcite .",
    "the method treats the complete data set as a mixture of two populations : one population of supposedly correctly measured uncertainties , and another one for which the reported uncertainty estimates are too optimistic .",
    "the goal is to design an algorithm that can automatically identify and reduce the weight of the data points with over - optimistic uncertainties ( i.e. , outliers ) .",
    "this is achieved by including a parameter describing the membership to the different populations into the random sampling of the posterior .",
    "the procedure has a number of advantages . in the analysis",
    ", each datum contributes to the posterior with a larger weight the smaller the uncertainty and the higher the probability that the reported uncertainty is correct .",
    "all of the data points are taken into account in the analysis and none are discarded .",
    "the mcmc sampling also quantifies the outlier probability for a given datum .",
    "the ` jags ` implementation of robust regression for a simple example is described in appendix  [ sec : regression ] .",
    "nuclear reaction cross sections , or astrophysical s - factors , are experimentally determined by products and ratios of many nuclear physics input quantities : measured net intensities , incident beam charge , detection efficiencies , number of target nuclei , stopping powers , etc . according to the central limit theorem , the probability density of a derived quantity , such as the cross section or s - factor ,",
    "will then be distributed according to a lognormal rather than a normal probability density ( equation  [ eq : lognormal ] ) .",
    "this situation was discussed in @xcite .",
    "the lognormal parameters are given by @xmath33 ) - \\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{v[x]}{e[x]^2 } \\right ) \\\\\\ ] ] @xmath34}{e[x]^2 } \\right)}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 $ ] and @xmath36 $ ] denote the mean value and the variance ( i.e. , the square root of the standard deviation ) , respectively .",
    "for standard deviations @xmath3710% of the mean value , the lognormal probability density is very close in shape to a gaussian .",
    "however , with increasing relative standard deviations , the differences between the lognormal density function and a gaussian approximation increase .",
    "notice also that , unlike the lognormal probability density , a gaussian density function predicts a finite probability for negative values of the random variable , which is unphysical for manifestly positive quantities , such as nuclear reaction cross sections or astrophysical s - factors .",
    "the ` jags ` syntax for implementing lognormal likelihoods is given in appendix  [ sec : regression ] .    at low bombarding energies , where the experimental yields are very small , the reported uncertainties on data points are frequently large . for example ,",
    "how should one interpret a reported s - factor of `` @xmath38  kevb '' , which implies a finite chance of a zero s - factor ?",
    "it is certainly inappropriate to assume a gaussian likelihood in this case , because the s - factor can not become negative .",
    "but it is equally inappropriate to assume a lognormal likelihood , which predicts zero probability for a zero s - factor . in such cases ,",
    "the total statistical uncertainty is dominated by counting statistics and the appropriate likelihood function to use is a poissonian ( or a difference of poissonians , if the net intensity is inferred from total and background counts ) .",
    "suppose we perform a simple counting measurement .",
    "we have measured the total and the background counts , and we are interested in estimating the signal ( i.e. , total minus background ) counts . when we set up a bayesian model for this situation , it is appropriate to assume poissonian likelihoods for both the total and the background counts . figure  [ fig : counts ] shows numerical results obtained using ` jags ` .",
    "the panels display the posteriors for the signal counts .",
    "we assumed a uniform prior between @xmath30 and @xmath39 , i.e. , the posterior will closely reflect the shape of the likelihood ( see equation  [ eqn : bayes3 ] ) .",
    "the different panels are obtained for a total number of counts of @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath9 , while the background counts are kept fixed at @xmath43 . the predicted mean and standard deviation of the signal is indicated in each panel .",
    "when the total number of counts is relatively large ( e.g. , @xmath40 ; see first panel ) , the probability for predicting zero signal counts is negligible .",
    "in addition , the shape of the density function is well approximated by a lognormal distribution . on the other hand , when the total number of counts is similar to the background counts ( e.g. , @xmath43 ; see last panel ) , the posterior predicts a large probability at zero signal counts and certainly does not resemble a lognormal distribution .",
    "the sequence of panels shows that the probability density can be approximated by a lognormal distribution as long as the ratio of mean value and standard deviation is @xmath44 ( see second panel ) .",
    "similar results are obtained when different priors are used ( e.g. , gamma functions , exponentials , or hyperpriors ) .",
    "consequently , we will exclude in our analysis of experimental s - factors the few data points that do not satisfy this criterion .",
    "we will now apply the bayesian method to the estimation of astrophysical s - factors , @xmath45 .",
    "this quantity is defined as @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the nuclear reaction cross section at the center - of - mass energy , @xmath48 .",
    "the quantity @xmath49 denotes the gamow factor , given by @xmath50 with @xmath51 the charges of the projectile and target ; in this expression , the relative atomic masses , @xmath52 , and the energy , @xmath48 , are in units of u and mev , respectively .",
    "the experimental s - factor can be extracted from data using fitting functions based either on a polynomial representation or on nuclear reaction models .",
    "the former provides a result that is independent of nuclear theory .",
    "because this procedure has no theoretical justification beyond the known data points , it requires that the s - factor data cover the entire energy region of astrophysical interest .",
    "however , this is frequently not the case , especially at low bombarding energies , where the coulomb barrier greatly inhibits direct measurements .",
    "when data are missing in the region of interest , fitting functions motivated by nuclear theory ( e.g. , potential models , microscopic calculations , or r - matrix approaches ) are usually preferred @xcite . with this method",
    ", it is assumed that the nuclear model reliably describes the _ energy dependence _ of the s - factor , but that the _ absolute scale _ is determined by a fit of the data using the nuclear model .",
    "the assumption of an additional normalization motivated by experimental data can be explained qualitatively .",
    "for example , many microscopic models compute the interior wave functions over truncated configuration spaces , with consequences for the normalization .",
    "similarly , in _ ab initio _ models , small variations in the strength of the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction , which is adjusted to reproduce nucleon - nucleon scattering data , will result in changes of the s - factor normalization .",
    "nevertheless , we emphasize that the need for an additional normalization has no rigorous theoretical justification . however , since we can not easily compute microscopic models and vary the model parameters , the assumption of a normalization factor determined by experiment represents the most straightforward method . in any case",
    ", the extrapolation of the s - factor beyond the measured data will have some theoretical justification .",
    "we will present in the following a bayesian analysis for several light - particle nuclear reactions , assuming for the model s - factor either a polynomial representation or the results of nuclear models .",
    "each of these reactions has it own intricacies .",
    "the d(p,@xmath0)@xmath13he reaction represents the second step in the pp chains of stellar hydrogen burning . since its rate is much faster compared to the first step , p(p , e@xmath53@xmath54)d , uncertainties in the d(p,@xmath0)@xmath1he reaction are usually not important for stellar energy generation . in special situations ,",
    "however , this reaction does play a crucial role .",
    "for example , during the earliest stages of stellar evolution , when a cloud of interstellar gas collapses to form a protostar , the central temperature reaches a few million kelvin .",
    "at this temperature , primordial deuterium fuses with hydrogen ( _ deuterium burning _ ) , thereby generating nuclear energy that slows the contraction and the central heating of the gas until the deuterium is consumed .",
    "the d(p,@xmath0)@xmath13he reaction also plays a crucial role in big bang nucleosynthesis ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , which begins when the temperature has declined to @xmath55 @xmath56  gk , corresponding to relevant kinetic energies of @xmath55 @xmath57  kev . the uncertainty in the d(p,@xmath0)@xmath13he reaction rate impacts the primordial abundances of d , @xmath13he , and @xmath58li .",
    "for example , the reaction rate needs to be known to better than @xmath55 @xmath43% below an energy of @xmath59  kev to compare big bang nucleosynthesis predictions to the very precise value ( uncertainty of @xmath60% ) of the deuterium - to - hydrogen ( d / h ) abundance ratio measured in very metal - poor , damped lyman-@xmath3 systems @xcite .",
    "most recently , s - factors and reaction rates for d(p,@xmath0)@xmath13he have been presented by @xcite .",
    "a reliable estimation of s - factors requires simultaneous knowledge of statistical _ and _ systematic uncertainties , as discussed in section  [ sec : sysuncert ] . among the many data sets published during 1962 - 2008 , this information is only available for four studies @xcite .",
    "these were the only data sets used by @xcite for their s - factor estimation , and we will apply the same data selection  kev , @xmath61  kev , and @xmath62  kev ( instead of @xmath63  kev , @xmath64  kev , and @xmath65  kev).[fn : data ] ] .",
    "the data point at the lowest measured bombarding energy of @xcite has a mean - value - to - standard - deviation ratio in excess of a factor of @xmath66 and has been omitted in our analysis for the reasons given in section  [ sec : nongauss ] .",
    "this data point was included in the analysis of @xcite .",

    "similar to @xcite , we will adopt in the present work the theoretical s - factors from @xcite .",
    "they were obtained using variational wave functions for the p - d continuum and @xmath13he bound states , together with a hamiltonian consisting of two - nucleon and three - nucleon potentials .",
    "we will assume that the theoretical model adequately describes the shape of the s - factor curve , but that the absolute scale of the model s - factor is determined by the fit to the data .",
    "the ` jags ` model for each of the four data sets includes the effects of systematic uncertainties , robust regression , and lognormal likelihood functions , as discussed in section  [ sec : regression2 ] .",
    "our bayesian model has five parameters .",
    "four of these are the normalizations of the individual data sets .",
    "the highly informative priors for these parameters are computed using systematic uncertainty factors of @xmath72 @xcite , @xmath72 @xcite , @xmath73 @xcite , and @xmath74 @xcite , which are listed in table i of @xcite .",
    "the fifth parameter is the common scaling factor by which the nuclear model results have to be multiplied to fit the data .",
    "we assume a non - informative prior for this parameter , i.e. , a normal probability density with a location of zero and a standard deviation of @xmath57 .",
    "the distribution was truncated at zero since the scaling factor must be a positive quantity .",
    "other choices of priors ( i.e. , uniform and gamma functions ) gave very similar results .",
    "the theoretical s - factor from @xcite , available to us as a table of 100,000 s - factor values between center - of - mass energies of @xmath75  mev and @xmath76  mev , was directly implemented into ` jags ` . with our bayesian model",
    ", we generated random samples using three independent markov chains , each of length 75,000 ( without burn - in ) .",
    "this ensures that the monte carlo fluctuations are negligible compared to the statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "a first impression can be obtained from figure  [ fig : dpg ] .",
    "the grey shaded region consists of lines that correspond to the credible s - factor curves , where each line corresponds to one sampled set of model parameters .",
    "the blue line represents the median ( 50th percentile ) , and the red lines the 16th and 84th percentiles of all credible s - factors .",
    "more information on the meaning of these lines can be found in appendix [ sec : inference ] .",
    "details of our analysis are given in table  [ tab : tabdpg ] and are compared to recently published results obtained using traditional statistics ( @xmath11 minimization ) .",
    "the top part of the table displays the normalization factors ( `` norm '' ) of each data set , taking into account the reported systematic uncertainties ( see above ) .",
    "the present and previous values overlap within uncertainties .",
    "however , the magnitude of the uncertainties differs significantly .",
    "for example , for the data of @xcite our uncertainties are a factor of @xmath554 larger than those of @xcite , while for the data of @xcite our uncertainties are smaller by a factor of @xmath552 .",
    "the fourth column summarizes the outlier probability of the different data sets .",
    "the values are computed from the average of the outlier probabilities of all data points in a given set , as predicted by ` jags ` .",
    "the data of @xcite have an average outlier probability of 72% , in agreement with the elevated reduced @xmath11 found by @xcite for this set .",
    "the same data sets were analyzed in both @xcite and in the present work , and the same systematic uncertainties were adopted in both studies .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to investigate the main reason for the significant differences , mentioned above , that are obtained in the analysis of the data of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we performed a series of tests and found that neither inclusion or omission of the lowest lying data point in @xcite , nor the use of the correct or incorrect center - of - mass energies in @xcite ( see footnote  [ fn : data ] ) had an effect on our derived normalization factors listed in the top part of table  [ tab : tabdpg ] .",
    "these changes in the data sets are too small to affect the analysis .",
    "we also performed a test by using gaussian instead of lognormal likelihoods for the data points and obtained again results in agreement with those listed in table  [ tab : tabdpg ] .",
    "this is not surprising because , with few exceptions , the data points have relatively small error bars , implying that a gaussian closely approximates the lognormal likelihood ( section  [ sec : nongauss ] ) .",
    "we thus conclude that the significant differences obtained presently and previously regarding the data sets of @xcite and @xcite are caused by the adoption of a bayesian model in our work as opposed to using a traditional method employed by @xcite",

    "our bayesian analysis verifies the results reported by @xcite , both for the recommended values and the magnitude of the uncertainties .",
    "our zero - energy s - factor also agrees with the value presented in @xcite , although our uncertainty ( @xmath77% ) is smaller by a factor of @xmath78 .",
    "the analysis by @xcite was performed using a @xmath11 minimization and assuming a quadratic parameterization of the s - factor .",
    "the zero - energy s - factor presented in @xcite has a much larger uncertainty ( @xmath79% ) compared to all other recent values .",
    "it was obtained , using a potential model , from a standard @xmath11 fit in conjunction with a `` fit - by - eye '' technique .    in summary ,",
    "completely independent methods of analysis provide comparable results .",

    "the @xmath13he(@xmath13he,2p)@xmath80he reaction represents the third and final step of the pp1 chain .",
    "the competition of this process with the @xmath13he(@xmath3,@xmath0)@xmath58be reaction determines the relative neutrino fluxes that originate from the pp and pep reactions ( pp1 chain ) compared to the @xmath58be and @xmath81b decays ( pp2 and pp3 chains ) .",
    "the s - factor ratio for @xmath13he(@xmath13he,2p)@xmath80he and @xmath13he(@xmath3,@xmath0)@xmath58be enters directly in the calculation of the solar neutrino energy losses , and thus impacts the relationship between the photon luminosity and the total energy production of the sun @xcite .",
    "the astrophysical s - factor of @xmath13he(@xmath13he,2p)@xmath80he was recently evaluated by @xcite .",
    "as discussed above and in that work , a reliable estimation of the astrophysical s - factor requires separate knowledge of statistical and systematic uncertainties .",

    "only a single event was observed at each of these two energies , and the quoted errors refer to statistical uncertainties only ( see their table i ) .",
    "it is not difficult to include such data in a bayesian model _ if their probability densities were known_. since this information is not provided by @xcite , we can not include these two data points with very large errors .",

    "two major issues that need to be tested in a bayesian analysis are the mixing and convergence of the markov chains , and the sensitivity of the results to the priors .",
    "the former is achieved using suitable diagnostic tools @xcite , while the latter can be investigated by comparing posterior inferences under different reasonable choices of prior distribution .",
    "to illustrate these ideas with a simple example , we apply the bayesian method to the problem of linear regression .",
    "a comprehensive treatment of regression using bayesian statistics can be found in @xcite .",
    "suppose we aim to fit a straight line to some data , @xmath182 , given by @xmath191 , @xmath192 , and @xmath193 , with @xmath194 , @xmath195 , and @xmath196 the independent variable , dependent variable , and the error in the dependent variable , respectively . for simplicity , we will assume no error on the independent variable .",
    "the linear relationship between variables satisfies @xmath197 but @xmath198 can not be observed directly .",
    "instead , we observe the quantity @xmath199 if we further assume for this simple example that the errors , @xmath196 , are gaussian random variables with standard deviations of @xmath200 , the likelihood function for all data points is @xmath201)^2}{2\\sigma_i^2 } } } \\ ] ] which represents a product of normal distributions , each with a mean of @xmath202 and a standard deviation of @xmath200 . in abbreviated form , we may write symbolically for each data point @xmath203 implying that its value is sampled from a normal distribution with a mean equal to the true value , @xmath202 , and a variance of @xmath204 .    a specific example is displayed in figure  [ fig : linreg ] .",
    "the artificial data shown as open circles have been generated under the following assumptions : ( i ) first , @xmath205 @xmath206-values are sampled from a uniform probability density in the range from @xmath194 @xmath7 @xmath41 to @xmath207 @xmath7 @xmath208 ; ( ii ) the corresponding @xmath209-values are computed using the linear relationship @xmath198 @xmath7 @xmath210 , i.e. , an intercept of @xmath75 and a slope of @xmath29 ; ( iii ) a noise contribution to each @xmath198-value is sampled from a normal probability density with a mean of @xmath30 and a standard deviation of @xmath42 ; ( iv ) the observed value , @xmath209 , is obtained by adding the noise contribution to the true ( but unobserved ) value of @xmath198 , according to equation  [ eq : noise ] .",
    "in other words , in this simple example we assume the scatter is represented by the same distribution for all @xmath205 data points .",
    "we now analyze this hypothetical data set using bayesian inference and are particularly interested to see if the analysis recovers the input parameters used to generate the data , i.e. , the slope , the intercept , and the magnitude of the noise .",
    "the ` jags ` model , in symbolic notation , is set up as follows :    .... # likelihood obsy[i ] ~ dnorm(y[i ] , pow(sigmay , -2 ) ) y[i ] = alpha + beta * obsx[i ] # priors alpha ~ dnorm(0.0 , pow(100 , -2 ) ) beta ~ dnorm(0.0 , pow(100 , -2 ) ) sigmay ~ dunif(0 , 200 ) ....",
    "the third line states our model , i.e. , a linear relationship between the unobserved ( true ) @xmath209-value and the @xmath206-value .",
    "the second line describes the likelihood for each data point , @xmath189 .",
    "the `` @xmath166 '' symbol stands for `` distributed as '' or `` sampled from '' .",
    "thus we sample for each data point the observed value , @xmath198 ( ` obsy ` ) , from a normal probability density with a mean given by the true value , @xmath209 , and a standard deviation of @xmath23 ( ` sigmay ` ) .",
    "the ` pow ( ) ` command appears because ` jags ` requires as input the precision , @xmath211 @xmath212 @xmath213 , instead of the standard deviation , @xmath23 .",
    "the three parameters of our model are the intercept ( @xmath3 ) , the slope ( @xmath214 ) , and the scatter ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "next , each of these parameters require a prior probability density . for the slope and intercept we adopt normal distributions with a mean of zero and a standard distribution of @xmath57 , i.e. , very broad and slowly declining priors . for the standard deviation of the noise , we assume a uniform prior between values of @xmath30 and @xmath59 .",
    "the output of the ` jags ` model is displayed in figure  [ fig : jagsout ] .",
    "the panels on the left - hand side show @xmath215 samples of @xmath3 , @xmath214 , and @xmath23 , for three independent markov chains ( indicated by different colors in each panel ) .",
    "the first @xmath216 samples were discarded to ensure that the chains have achieved equilibrium ( `` burn - in '' ) .",
    "it is apparent that the scatter is uniform and the chains are well mixed .",
    "the panels on the right - hand side display the corresponding posterior densities for @xmath3 , @xmath214 , and @xmath23 . the 16th , 50th ( median ) , and 84th percentiles extracted from the posteriors are @xmath3 @xmath7 @xmath217 @xmath16 @xmath218 ,",
    "@xmath214 @xmath7 @xmath219 @xmath16 @xmath220 , and @xmath23 @xmath7 @xmath221 , and thus the orginal values used to generate the data set , shown as vertical red lines , are recovered within uncertainty . notice that the panels shown on the right - hand side represent `` marginalized '' posterior densities , i.e. , each distribution was obtained by integrating out the other two parameters . it would be inappropriate to use the full widths of the posteriors for estimating regression lines .",
    "such a procedure would overestimate the uncertainties because of parameter correlations .",
    "credible regression lines , calculated using the sampled values for the intercept ( @xmath3 ) and slope ( @xmath214 ) , marginalized over the scatter ( @xmath23 ) , form the grey shaded area in figure  [ fig : linreg ] .",
    "a few interesting observations can be made .",
    "first , the density of grey lines decreases with increasing distance from the data points .",
    "second , the width of the credible region is smallest in the middle of the data set , near @xmath206 @xmath55 @xmath222 , and increases towards lower and higher @xmath206-values .",
    "both observations agree with expectation , since the uncertainties should increase in regions devoid of data .",
    "we can quantify the credible region by computing suitable percentiles of @xmath209-values on a grid of @xmath206-values .",
    "the 50th percentile is shown as a blue line , whereas the 16th and 84th percentiles are displayed as red lines .",
    "therefore , at any given @xmath206-value , there is a 68% probability that the true ( but usually unknown ) @xmath209-value is located between the two red lines .",
    "the two dashed lines in figure  [ fig : linreg ] correspond to the 50th percentile , plus or minus the mean of the sampled values of the scatter , @xmath23 .",
    "the region between the two dashed lines indicates the most likely location of new data points acquired under the same conditions as the data shown",
    ".    we will now provide the ` jags ` implementation of systematic uncertainties , robust regression , and non - gaussian statistical uncertainties , discussed in section  [ sec : regression2 ] , for the example of linear regression .",
    "the inclusion of a systematic normalization uncertainty of a factor of @xmath20 can be accomplished by :    .... # likelihood obsy[i ] ~ dnorm(z[i ] , pow(erobsy[i ] , -2 ) ) z[i ] = n.factor * y[i ] y[i ] = alpha + beta * obsx[i ] # priors alpha ~ dnorm(0.0 , pow(100 , -2 ) ) beta ~ dnorm(0.0 , pow(100 , -2 ) ) # # lognormal density n.factor ~ dlnorm(logmu , pow(logsigma , -2 ) ) logmu = log(1.0 ) logsigma = log(1.1 ) ....    the first line contains the experimental statistical uncertainty , ` erobsy ` , for each individual data point , @xmath189 , instead of assuming the same error as we did above .",
    "the second line includes the normalization factor ( ` n.factor ` ) into the likelihood function .",
    "the last three lines contain the information about the prior for the systematic uncertainty : ` n.factor ` is sampled from a lognormal density ( ` dlnorm ` ) with parameters of logmu=0 and logsigma = log(1.1 ) , where ` log ` denotes the natural logarithm .",
    "robust regression can be implemented into our simple example as :    .... # likelihood obsy[i ] ~ dnorm(y[i ] , pow(corr.er[i ] , -2 ) ) p.alt[i ] ~ dcat(p [ ] ) corr.er[i ] = erobsy[i ] * phi[p.alt[i ] ] y[i ] = alpha + beta * obsx[i ] # priors alpha ~ dnorm(0.0 , pow(100 , -2 ) ) beta ~ dnorm(0.0 , pow(100 , -2 ) ) # if measured errors are correct : phi[1 ] = 1 # if measured errors are overoptimistic : phi[2 ] ~ dunif(1 , 50 ) p[1 ] ~ dunif(0 , 1 ) p[2 ] = 1 - p[1 ] ....    first , a two - element vector ` phi [ ] ` is defined : for phi[1]=1 it is assumed that the reported uncertainty for a given datum , @xmath189 , is correct ; phi[2 ] is sampled from a uniform distribution between @xmath153 and some higher value ( e.g. , @xmath223 in this example ) .",
    "for example , if p[1]=0.2 and p[2]=0.8 , then ` dcat ( ) ` will return values of @xmath153 or @xmath78 with a probability of @xmath224 and @xmath225 , respectively , each time ` dcat ( ) ` is called .",
    "if p.alt[]=1 , we obtain phi[1]=1 , and the observed uncertainty for a given datum is assumed to be correct . if , on the other hand , p.alt[]=2 , then the reported uncertainty of a given datum is multiplied by a factor of phi[2 ] .",
    "the mcmc sampling quantifies the outlier probability for a given datum by counting the number of times the indices 1 ( no outlier ) or 2 ( outlier ) have been called .    to account for the lognormal likelihood of the data analyzed here",

    "<S> the problem of estimating non - resonant astrophysical s - factors and thermonuclear reaction rates , based on measured nuclear cross sections , is of major interest for nuclear energy generation , neutrino physics , and element synthesis . </S>",

    "<S> bayesian methods , on the other hand , are now in widespread use in the physical sciences . in astronomy , for example , bayesian statistics is applied to the observation of extra - solar planets , gravitational waves , and type ia supernovae . </S>",
