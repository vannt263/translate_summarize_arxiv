    "materials , which are simultaneously ( anti)ferromagnetic and ( anti)ferroelectric , are now the subject of renewed interest @xcite . however , in spite of intensive recent research , such substances are quite rare .",
    "a newly discovered compound , tbmno@xmath2 , is a multiferroic material . in zero magnetic field",
    ", it shows a spontaneous ferroelectric polarization along the @xmath6 axis ( @xmath7@xmath8 ) below the incommensurate - commensurate ( ic - c ) or lock - in antiferromagnetic ( af ) transition , temperature ( @xmath9 ) @xcite . in magnetic fields along the @xmath10 axis ,",
    "its direction of ferroelectric polarization ( @xmath11 ) changes from along the @xmath6 to the @xmath12 axis , an event called a `` magnetic - field - induced electric polarization flop '' .",
    "the compound tbmno@xmath2 has several magnetic transitions : the ic af transition ( @xmath13@xmath1441k ) , the ic - c ( lock - in ) af transition ( @xmath15@xmath1427k ) , and the ordering transition of the tb 4@xmath16 moments ( @xmath17@xmath147k ) .",
    "the ferroelectric transition of tbmno@xmath2 corresponds to an ic - c af transition that is due to the magnetic ordering of mn 3@xmath18 spins .    in the case of another such compound , gdmno@xmath2 @xcite ,",
    "we have found the ferroelectric phase below 13k . at this temperature ,",
    "the gd 4@xmath16 moments antiferromagnetically couple with the mn 3@xmath18 spins and the weak ferromagnetism of the mn 3@xmath18 spins , caused by the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction , is suppressed .",
    "transitions displayed by gdmno@xmath2 include the ic af transition ( @xmath13@xmath1442k ) , the @xmath19-type af transition ( @xmath20@xmath1420k ) , and the ordering transition of the gd 4@xmath16 moments or an af coupling between the gd 4@xmath16 moments and mn 3@xmath18 spins ( @xmath21@xmath1413k ) . in gdmno@xmath2 ,",
    "the @xmath19-type af transition and the transition of the gd 4@xmath16 moments possess a thermal hysteresis , and the temperatures listed above refer to a warming scan .",
    "the @xmath11 of gdmno@xmath2 , relative to the order of the gd 4@xmath16 moments , exists along the @xmath12 axis in zero field @xcite . in our previous work",
    ", we demonstrated that the mechanism of the ferroelectric transition in gdmno@xmath2 is different from that in tbmno@xmath2 in zero field , although gd and tb ions are adjoining members of the lanthanum series @xcite .",
    "the former should be classified as a first - order displacive - type transition , and the latter as a transition of the second - order order - disorder - type .",
    "the difference in ferroelectric transition mechanisms between gdmno@xmath2 and tbmno@xmath2 are thought to originate in their degree of orthorhombic distortion and in the magnitude of their rare earth moments .",
    "therefore , to clarify the crossover between the two distinct magnetic and ferroelectric phases , we measured the ferroelectric and magnetic properties of @xmath22mno@xmath2 ( @xmath22@xmath5gd@xmath0tb@xmath1 , 0@xmath23@xmath4@xmath231 ) compounds while exerting a fine degree of control of the degree of orthorhombic distortion , also known as the chemical pressure , and the magnitude of the rare earth moments , by changing @xmath22-site chemical composition .",
    "all single crystals used in this work were prepared by the floating zone method .",
    "we carried out an x - ray diffraction experiment to confirm that all crystals showed an orthorhombic @xmath24 structure without any impurity phase .",
    "all specimens used in the measurements were cut along the crystallographic principal axes into a rectangular shape .",
    "the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant ( @xmath25 ) and @xmath11 were measured in a temperature - controllable cryostat with a superconducting magnet that provided a field up to 8 t .",
    "the @xmath11 was estimated by a pyroelectric - current measurement taken in a warming scan at a rate of 4k / min , after the sample had been cooled under a poling field of 300@xmath14500kv / m .",
    "axis ( @xmath25@xmath26 ( upper panel ) ) and @xmath11 along the same axis ( lower ) for gd@xmath0tb@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( 0.0@xmath23@xmath4@xmath231.0 ) crystals in zero field .",
    "the af transition temperature @xmath27@xmath28 and @xmath15 are shown by open and solid triangles , respectively .",
    "the arrows indicate the direction of temperature scan . for clarity , the plot for each compound in the upper panel is shifted vertically without any change of scale ( refer to the scale shown in the right side of the panel ) . ]",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the dielectric and ferroelectric properties of several gd@xmath0tb@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( 0.0@xmath23@xmath4@xmath231.0 ) crystals .",
    "the amount of orthorhombic distortion was systematically increased by varying @xmath4 between 0 and 1 . as a result ,",
    "the dielectric behavior systematically changed from gdmno@xmath2-like to tbmno@xmath2-like .",
    "it is clear that , the dielectric constant along the @xmath12 axis ( @xmath25@xmath26 ) changed drastically from gdmno@xmath2-type to tbmno@xmath2-type around 0.3@xmath3@xmath4@xmath30.4 . a sharp change in @xmath25@xmath26 , associated with the af transition temperature @xmath27@xmath28 , that exhibited thermal hysteresis ( @xmath29 symbol in fig.[fig1 ] ) gradually disappeared and changed to a small inflection associated with @xmath15 as @xmath4 increased .",
    "at the same composition ( 0.3@xmath3@xmath4@xmath30.4 ) the direction of @xmath11 changes from along the @xmath12 axis to the @xmath6 axis . with increasing @xmath4 , the anomaly indicated by @xmath29 symbol below @xmath4@xmath50.3 and that by @xmath30 symbol above @xmath4@xmath50.4 shifted toward higher temperature .",
    "except for the two end members , the magnetic structures of these materials below the temperature of the anomaly have not yet been identified .",
    "however , the systematic change in @xmath25@xmath26 suggest that the anomalies indicated by the open and solid triangles correspond to @xmath27@xmath28 and @xmath15 , respectively . concerning our initial motivation of clarifying the change of dielectric properties between @xmath4@xmath50 and @xmath4@xmath51 ,",
    "we can conclude that the compositional phase boundary between @xmath4@xmath50 ( gdmno@xmath2-type , first - order displacive - type ) and @xmath4@xmath51 ( tbmno@xmath2-type , second - order order - disorder - type ) exists around 0.3@xmath3@xmath4@xmath30.4 .",
    "for the @xmath4@xmath50.1 sample in zero field , the ferroelectric polarization along the @xmath12 axis ( @xmath31@xmath8 , fe1 ) disappeared ( see lower panel ) , and the thermal hysteresis in @xmath25@xmath26 due to the ferroelectric transition below 13k , as seen in the @xmath4@xmath50 sample , was also suppressed ( upper panel ) . however , when we increased @xmath4 to 0.3 , another @xmath31@xmath8 ( fe2 ) was observed at around @xmath27@xmath28 .",
    "the transition character of fe2 seems to be different from that of gdmno@xmath2 ( fe1 ) . in the case of gdmno@xmath2 ,",
    "the origin of fe1 is the magnetic ordering of gd 4@xmath16 moments and the ferroelectric transition is accompanied by thermal hysteresis , as described in the introduction . therefore ,",
    "unless a sample is cooled below 6k , at which temperature the magnetic transition of the gd 4@xmath16 moments occurs in a cooling process @xcite , fe1 does not appear at all . in order to clarify the difference between fe1 and fe2",
    ", we have investigated the existence of @xmath11 ( fe2 ) for the @xmath4@xmath50.3 sample after the sample was cooled down to several different temperature above 6k .",
    "consequently , it turns out that the @xmath11 ( fe2 ) still appears even if the sample is cooled down to 10k , a temperature higher than the magnetic transition temperature of rare - earth ion 4@xmath16 moments . in the case of the gd ion ,",
    "the magnetic transition temperature is 6k @xcite , and that of tb ion is 7k @xcite .",
    "this result strongly suggests that fe2 has a different origin from fe1 and is associated with the ordering of the gd 4@xmath16 moments .",
    "therefore , we propose that the origin of fe2 is related to @xmath27@xmath28 , which is the temperature of an af transition of mn 3@xmath18 spins .",
    "we investigated the lattice striction of this compound and there was no first - order like transition at @xmath27@xmath28 .",
    "this result suggested that the ferroelectric transition of fe2 in @xmath4=0.3 is the order - disorder type , like tbmno@xmath2 . with further increase of @xmath4 , fe2 disappeared and @xmath7@xmath8 ( signaling the appearance of the tbmno@xmath2-type ferroelectric phase ) appeared for the @xmath4@xmath50.4 sample .",
    "( not shown in fig.[fig1 ] . )",
    "tb@xmath1mno@xmath2 @xmath4@xmath50.1 sample .",
    "upper ( lower ) panel shows the temperature dependence of @xmath25@xmath26 ( @xmath31@xmath8 ) in magnetic fields applied parallel to the @xmath10 axis .",
    "the arrows indicate the direction of @xmath32 scan .",
    "for clarity , the plot for each fields in upper panel is shifted vertically without any change of scale ( refer to the scale shown in the right side of the panel ) . ]",
    "next , in order to reveal the crossover between fe1 ( @xmath4@xmath50 ) and fe2 ( @xmath4@xmath50.3 ) , we examined the dielectric ( upper panel of fig.[fig2 ] ) and ferroelectric ( lower panel ) properties of the @xmath4@xmath50.1 sample , in which @xmath11 can not be detected along any axis @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 , in various magnetic fields applied parallel to the @xmath10 axis .",
    "we chose this direction to enhance the ferroelectric phase ( fe1 ) because the @xmath10 axis is the easy magnetic axis in the case of @xmath4@xmath50 ( gdmno@xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "the behavior of @xmath25@xmath26 for @xmath4@xmath50.1 changes from gdmno@xmath2-like ( fe1 ) to fe2-type behavior at @xmath4@xmath50.3 with increase of field . in spite of absence of a ferroelectric phase @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 , when we applied fields up to 2 t in strength parallel to the @xmath10 axis , thermal hysteresis in @xmath25@xmath26 similar to the case of @xmath4@xmath50 appeared below 13k , and the @xmath31@xmath8 also appeared .",
    "furthermore , if the field was increased to more than 4 t , a peak emerges in @xmath25@xmath26 around @xmath36@xmath28 in the warming process . as can be clearly seen in the lower panel of fig.[fig2 ] ,",
    "the transition temperature for the appearance of @xmath31@xmath8 , corresponding to the dielectric peak , systematically increased for fields above 4 t .",
    "we suppose that the ferroelectric transition temperature ( @xmath37 ) of the @xmath4@xmath50.1 compound @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 in a cooling scan occurs at lower temperature than we could attain . in other words , by the application of the fields the @xmath37 was shifted toward a higher temperature that we could observe .",
    "thus , we suggest that the ferroelectric phase in the @xmath4@xmath50.1 material present below 3 t has the same origin as fe1 in the @xmath4@xmath50 compound ( gdmno@xmath2 ) .    on the other hand , @xmath33",
    "@xmath38 @xmath35 @xmath39 @xmath40 , the @xmath11 that appeared around @xmath36@xmath28 ( @xmath1423k ) closely resembles fe2 in the @xmath4@xmath50.3 sample . as one can immediately notice from the lower panel of fig.[fig2 ] , @xmath31@xmath8 @xmath33 @xmath41 @xmath35 @xmath39 @xmath40 shows two successive phase transitions : an abrupt jump around @xmath27@xmath28 ( @xmath1423k ) corresponding to fe2 and a gradual increase around 15k corresponding to fe1 .",
    "these results suggest that both fe1 and fe2 coexist in the @xmath4@xmath50.1 sample @xmath33 @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 .",
    "we investigated the cooling - hysteresis dependence of @xmath11 in the @xmath4@xmath50.1 compound @xmath33 @xmath43 for the purpose of exploring the possible existence of fe1 and@xmath44or fe2 and the correlation between fe1 and fe2 ( i.e. the same zero field experiment as discussed previously for the 0.3 sample ) .",
    "after cooling down to 18k under 4 t , we observed only the fe2-like @xmath31@xmath8 .",
    "this result strongly implies that both fe1 and fe2 coexist independently , although transitions of fe1 and fe2 occurred sequentially for @xmath4@xmath50.1 ( gd@xmath45tb@xmath46mno@xmath2 ) @xmath33 @xmath12 @xmath35 .",
    "tb@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( @xmath4=0.0(top ) , 0.1(middle ) , and 0.3(bottom ) ) in the plane of temperature and field .",
    "the @xmath4=0.1 sample shows the presence of both fe1 and fe2 simultaneously at higher magnetic fields ( see text ) .",
    "the dotted line between 0@xmath23@xmath4@xmath232 t was extrapolated from the value of higher magnetic fields . ]",
    "to better illuminate this complicated situation , we have summarized our results in the electric and magnetic phase diagrams shown in fig.[fig3 ] for gd@xmath0tb@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( @xmath4=0.0 , 0.1 , and 0.3 ) .",
    "these are derived from the dielectric anomalies observed in fields parallel to the @xmath10 axis . in the case of @xmath4@xmath50 ( gdmno@xmath2 ) ( top panel ) ,",
    "fe1 was observed in fields up to 8 t and it was enhanced by application of the field .",
    "this result indicates that @xmath37 increases with the field strength . on the other hand , @xmath4@xmath50.3 ( bottom panel )",
    "shows fe2 in fields , which was also enhanced at higher fields .",
    "this behavior seems to be connected with the stabilizing af ordering of mn 3@xmath18 spins . in the @xmath4@xmath50.1 case ( middle panel )",
    ", we did not observe @xmath11 @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 .",
    "however , we believe that , for this material , the @xmath37 occurs below 5k , the lowest temperature we can attain . accordingly , we have represented the low temperature region of @xmath4@xmath50.1 below 2 t as fe1 . we have confirmed the existence of fe1 in @xmath4@xmath50.1 in a field of 2 t .",
    "when we increased the fields up to 3 t , fe2 appeared at a higher temperature than fe1 , and both fe1 and fe2 coexisted in fields up to 8 t .",
    "this phase assignment is reasonable considering the results of a systematic increase of @xmath37 with the fields for @xmath4@xmath50 ( fe1 ) and 0.3 ( fe2 ) .",
    "we have investigated the systematic variation of dielectric and ferroelectric properties between gdmno@xmath2 and tbmno@xmath2 in magnetic fields .",
    "we have clearly demonstrated that the compositional phase boundary between @xmath31@xmath8 ( gdmno@xmath2-type : fe1 ) and @xmath7@xmath8 ( tbmno@xmath2-type ) is located at 0.3@xmath3@xmath4@xmath30.4 .",
    "moreover , we have found that another ferroelectric phase ( fe2 ) exists even below the phase boundary , which was contrary to our simple expectation , i.e. the ferroelectric transition would systematically change from gdmno@xmath2 to tbmno@xmath2 .",
    "although fe2 originates in the af ordering of mn 3@xmath18 spins seen in tbmno@xmath2-type materials , the direction of @xmath11 is not along the @xmath6 axis but is along the @xmath12 axis , as observed in gdmno@xmath2-type compounds .",
    "these results suggest that @xmath11 with the same origin ( the af ordering of mn 3@xmath18 spins ) can be made to occur along the @xmath12 or the @xmath6 axis simply by changing the orthorhombic distortion and the magnetic moment of the 4@xmath16 electrons .",
    "we have found successive phase transitions for @xmath4@xmath50.1 , in which both fe1 and fe2 coexisted @xmath33 @xmath12 @xmath38 @xmath35 .",
    "the wide variety of ferroelectric phases found as a function of field or change in orthorhombic distortion and 4@xmath16 moments will likely provide significant information on the mechanism of the ferroelectric phase transition in this system .",
