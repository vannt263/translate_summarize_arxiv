    "it is by now well established that approximately half of the stellar systems in the galactic disk consist of at least two stars .",
    "this high frequency of multiple stars suggests that binary formation is an integral part of the overall star - formation process , rather than separate , post - formation event .",
    "thus , an empirical determination of parameters such as the overall binary frequency , the mass - ratio distribution and the variation in those quantities as a function of the mass of the primary star , can constrain formation mechanisms . moreover ,",
    "binary star surveys represent one of most effective methods of searching for objects of substellar mass , and hence setting limits on the likely numbers of brown dwarfs .",
    "most statistical studies of binaries have concentrated on field stars in the immediate solar vicinity .",
    "in particular , duquennoy & mayor ( 1991 ) conducted a detailed spectroscopic survey of 164 late - f and g - dwarfs drawn from the nearby star catalogue ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . combining the spectroscopic binaries detected from those observations with data from the literature on binaries at wider separations",
    ", they estimate a binary frequency of at least 60% amongst solar - type stars .",
    "in contrast , surveys of lower - mass stars ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) indicate a lower overall binary frequency of @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , @xcite have argued that the mass ratio distribution amongst m - dwarfs differs significantly from that amongst the higher - mass g - dwarfs , with a clear bias towards equal - mass systems amongst the low - mass stars .",
    "this conclusion rests upon observations of a total of barely 75 m - dwarfs , however .",
    "open clusters provide an alternative avenue for studying binary statistics .",
    "one has the advantage of a sample of comparable size to that provided by the nearest stars , but comprising stars of known age and abundance , formed in the same environment .",
    "one is , however , faced with the potential drawback that dynamical evolution may have influenced either ( or both ) the relative binary fraction and the distribution of orbital parameters .",
    "the latter issue can be addressed by combining observations of stars in clusters spanning a range of ages",
    ".    amongst the nearer open clusters , the hyades , at an average distance of 48 parsecs , is clearly a prime target .",
    "the proximity of the cluster and the significant space motion relative to the sun lead to substantial proper motions , and surveys by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have provided a well - defined list of cluster members to v=19.5 or m@xmath8 .",
    "radial velocity surveys for spectroscopic binaries have been undertaken , primarily by @xcite , while high - resolution imaging surveys for companions at wider separations have been carried out at optical ( @xcite ) and infrared ( @xcite ) wavelengths .",
    "these surveys , however , are restricted to the brighter stars in the cluster , scarcely extending fainter than k - type dwarfs .",
    "thus , while the results provide a valuable dataset for comparison with the @xcite analysis , there is little overlap with the local surveys of low - mass stars .    over the last three years",
    ", we have been carrying out a survey aimed specifically at identifying binary companions at moderate to wide separations amongst the lowest - mass members of the hyades cluster .",
    "we have been using the planetary camera on the hubble space telescope to obtain high spatial - resolution images which are capable of detecting secondary companions at separations of 15 a.u .",
    "or more , and with masses at or below the hydrogen - burning limit .",
    "preliminary results from this survey were reported in @xcite ( hereinafter paper i ) .",
    "observations have since been made of a further 39 candidate hyads , more than doubling the sample size .",
    "section 2 describes those observations ; in section 3 , we calculate the binary frequency and compare our result against observations of higher - mass hyades stars , and data for stars in the solar neighbourhood ; section 4 discusses the implications of our lack of detection of any candidate brown dwarf companions ; section 5 presents our conclusions .",
    "all of the stars in the present sample are selected from the region of the hyades covered by the @xcite survey .",
    "all have vri photometry ( reid , 1993 ) and absolute magnitudes of m@xmath9 .",
    "table 1 lists photometry and ( for hyades stars ) distance estimates for the thirty - nine stars added to the sample since the observations reported in paper i. all save one of these stars are drawn from the @xcite proper - motion survey : the exception is b 804 , from @xcite , which is the lowest - luminosity hyades member identified to date .",
    "the distances are derived from the observed proper motion , assuming that the stars are hyades members .",
    "the @xcite motions are absolute , calibrated using a galaxian reference frame , and there is good agreement between the mean cluster motion derived from that study and schwann s ( 1991 ) meridian circle results . on that basis",
    ", we have adopted the schwann determination of the convergent point and the @xcite cluster radial velocity measurement for these calculations ; our previous analysis was based on the @xcite convergent point .",
    "schwann s analysis leads to a distance modulus of 3.40 magnitudes ( 47.9 parsecs ) to the cluster centre , and provides a distance - scale zeropoint accurate to @xmath10 .",
    "distances derived for individual stars using this method are independent of the photometry , and the @xmath11 uncertainties in the proper motions of these faint stars correspond to a @xmath12 uncertainty in the distance .",
    "each star was centred in the planetary camera ( pc ) on hst , and observed using the f850lp filter with exposure times of from 3 to 70 seconds .",
    "the latter were specified to leave the target star unsaturated , allowing a direct measurement of the relative brightness of any potential companions detected .",
    "two images were taken of most stars from our cycle 4 allocation and of all stars observed during cycle 6 , allowing unambiguous elimination of cosmic - ray events .",
    "the pc has a plate - scale of 0.046 arcsec pixel@xmath3 , while the diffraction limit of hst at 8500 is 0.073 arcseconds .",
    "as described in @xcite , we have used both the daofind routines and lucy - richardson deconvolution techniques to search for binary companions .",
    "these methods are capable of detecting an equal - luminosity companion at a separation of 0.09 arcseconds , and companions fainter by @xmath13 of 1 , 3 and 5 magnitudes at separations of 0.14 , 0.23 and 0.31 arcseconds , respectively .",
    "three stars in the current sample ( rhy 126 , 309 and 391 ) appear to have significant elongation in our pc observations , suggesting that they are probably equal - mass binaries with angular separations of @xmath14 arcseconds .",
    "table 1 lists our estimates of @xmath15 and @xmath13 for those three stars , where we have used daophot point - spread function fitting to deconvolve the hst images .",
    "the dates of each binary - star observation are listed in table 1 , and the images are available in the hst archive .",
    "four of the stars in the present sample are identified as background field stars , rather than hyades cluster members . as table 1",
    "show , all four stars have formal membership probabilities of less than 20% and , as hyades members , lie towards the lower edge of the colour - magnitude relation ( reid , 1993 ) .",
    "( as emphasised above , the distances , and hence absolute magnitudes , are derived from the observed proper motion under the assumption that the transverse velocity matches that of the cluster . ) two stars , rhy 80 and 271 , lack respectively the chromospheric and coronal activity which characterises cluster members emission , and is likely to be a non - member .",
    "cluster membership probability is based on comparing the stellar proper motion against a model for the expected cluster distribution and the proper motions of the underlying field star .",
    "observationally , we deal with individual stars , rather than distributions , and there is nothing to prevent a field star having exactly the motion expected for a cluster member .",
    "thus it is essential that proper motion - selected stars be regarded as only candidate cluster members , regardless of the formal membership probability , until confirmed by independent photometric , chromospheric and radial velocity criteria . ] .",
    "the other two stars , rhy 77 and 110 , are multiple systems , and are rejected as cluster members based on their location in the h - r diagram after allowing for the contribution to the ground - based photometry made by the secondary star ( figure 1a ) .",
    "rhy 77 is a near equal - mass binary , separation 0.46 arcseconds , while rhy 110 is a triple system , with components of i=15.32 , 16.21 and 17.00 mag ( @xmath15(ab)=069 , @xmath16(bc)=017 ) .",
    "the widest binary listed in table 1 has a separation of 1.12 arcseconds .",
    "none of these binaries were resolved in ground - based observations , and with hst observations at only one epoch , we can not identify these stars conclusively as bound companions .",
    "however , the observed surface density of stars with 14 @xmath17 i @xmath17 17 magnitude is only @xmath18 deg@xmath19 in the hyades fields surveyed by @xcite , implying an average separation of 3 arcminutes between stars , and a probability of @xmath20 of finding two stars at 1.2 arcseconds separation .",
    "all of the resolved binaries listed in table 1 are therefore very likely to be bound systems .",
    "possible companions at wider separations are accessible to ground - based ccd and photographic observations , notably poss i and poss ii plate material .",
    "all of the potential wide binary companions detected in the pc observations are visible on at least the poss ii , and usually the poss i , r - band plate material .",
    "none have either colours that are sufficiently red to be consistent with late - type m - dwarfs , or proper motions consistent with cluster membership .",
    "figure 1a plots the ( m@xmath21 , ( v@xmath22i ) ) colour - magnitude diagram for m - dwarfs that are identified as hyades members based on their proper motions ( reid , 1993 , appendix ) .",
    "the fainter stars with hst observations are identified separately in the figure .",
    "all of the binaries except rhy 240ab ( the two lowest luminosity binary components , see paper i ) have joint photometry , and most lie significantly above the main sequence .",
    "we have used the hst observations to estimate the relative contribution of each binary component to the ground - based v & i data , and figure 1b plots the results .",
    "we assume equal - mass components for each of the possible binaries listed in table 1 .",
    "lacking high - resolution v - band data , we have plotted the primary stars at the joint photometry colours - in most cases , the components are of nearly equal - mass and the colours can be expected to be little - affected .",
    "we have estimated ( v@xmath22i ) colours for the secondary stars ( excepting rhy 240ab ) based on the mean colour - magnitude relation .",
    "the reduced scatter in figure 1b is partly a result of these approximations .",
    "however , it is also clear that the main - sequence is noticeably narrower once due allowance is made for the composite nature of the hst binaries .",
    "there are a number of other obvious candidate binaries , notably rhy 390 at m@xmath21=15.03 , ( v@xmath22i)=3.83 , but also amongst earlier - type m - dwarfs .",
    "we are currently obtaining high - resolution spectroscopic observations , using hires on keck i , with the aim of identifying close stellar binaries amongst the lower - luminosity stars .",
    "until recently , the usual representation of the ( m@xmath21 , ( v@xmath22i ) ) lower main - sequence was a linear relation .",
    "however , @xcite first pointed out that the hyades colour - magnitude relation exhibited significant non - linearities at fainter magnitudes .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that there was a substantial discontinuity in the absolute magnitude / tio bandstrength relation at m@xmath23 ; and @xcite have shown that a break occurs at similar luminosities in the field - star ( m@xmath21 , ( v@xmath22i ) ) lower main - sequence . @xcite",
    "have argued that this feature is not due to atmospheric effects ( i.e. , structure in the effective temperature / colour relation ) , but rather reflects a change in the internal structure .",
    "figure 1b plots the three - segment colour - magnitude relation derived by @xcite from v- and i - band photometry of solar neighbourhood stars .",
    "the higher - metallicity hyades stars are redder than local field stars of the same absolute magnitude but , simply offsetting the nearby - star relation by 0.17 magnitudes in ( v@xmath22i ) to fit the hyades main - sequence at m@xmath24 leads to a reasonable match to the general morphology of the data at fainter magnitudes . @xcite",
    "have suggested that the change in slope at m@xmath23 reflects a change in the mass - radius relation , perhaps as a result of the stars becoming fully convective . whether this hypothesis is confirmed or not , cluster colour - magnitude diagrams offer the possibility of tracing the position of this break as a function of abundance and age .",
    "reliable identification of such features , however , demands both accurate photometry and an adequate multiple - star census , as demonstrated by figures 1a and 1b .",
    "combining the present observations with the results from paper i , we have identified at least nine , and perhaps as many as twelve , binaries amongst our total sample of fifty - three hyades m - dwarfs .",
    "this corresponds to a binary fraction , f@xmath25 of between 17 and 23% , with formal uncertainties of @xmath26 through counting statistics .",
    "these estimates are consistent with the results derived in our preliminary analysis ( gizis & reid , 1995 ) .",
    "clearly , this represents a lower limit to the the overall binary fraction , f@xmath27 , since only companions with projected separations of at least 0.1 arcseconds can be resolved unambiguously by the pc .",
    "indeed , as described in the previous section , the limiting magnitude for detecting a companion star varies with separation due to the underlying point - spread function of the primary star .",
    "thus , transforming the observed binary fraction to an estimate of the total binary fraction requires a model for the semi - major axis distribution so that one can allow for for unresolved systems at small angular separation . in paper",
    "i we combined an estimate of the detection efficiency as a function of radius with two representations of the semi - major axis distribution ( the @xcite g - dwarf log - normal period distribution , and fischer & marcy s ( 1992 ) results for field m - dwarfs ) to derive the appropriate correction factor . applying that factor to the value of f@xmath28 derived in paper i leads to an inferred f@xmath27 of @xmath29% , with the substantial uncertainties reflecting the small sample size .",
    "our present data allow a modest improvement in the statistical accuracy .",
    "we adopt a slightly different strategy in the analysis in the current paper .",
    "theoretical models calculated by @xcite predict that the hydrogen - burning limit in the hyades corresponds to m@xmath30 .",
    "the predicted effective temperature is @xmath31 k , comparable to that of gj 1111 , for which @xcite derive an i - band bolometric correction of 0.3 magnitudes .",
    "this implies that the hydrogen - burning limit corresponds to m@xmath32 magnitudes , 4 magnitudes fainter than the brightest stars in our sample .",
    "on the basis of our analysis of the hst images , we would expect to detect a companion with @xmath33 mag at a separation of @xmath34 arcseconds , or 13.5 a.u . at a distance of 48 parsecs .",
    "hence , our observations are capable of detecting all stellar companions with separations of between 13.5 and 825 a.u . , where the upper limit is set by the field of view of the pc .",
    "these constraints define a complete sample of six binaries ( rhy 49 , 119 , 221 , 240 , 246 and 377 - table 2 ) , or a binary fraction of 11.3@xmath35% .",
    "we can compare this statistic against the distribution of @xmath15 amongst the binaries in the 8-parsec sample defined by @xcite .",
    "in doing so , we take 825 a.u . , corresponding to the semi - diameter of the pc field of view , as the upper limit to @xmath15 in the hyades distribution .",
    "gliese 644/vb 8 is the only local binary that lies outwith this limit . limiting the calculation to the 78 systems where the brightest star has m@xmath36 , 11 of the 24 known binary ( or multiple ) stars have components separated by at least 13.5 a.u",
    "thus , f@xmath28 is @xmath37 , consistent with our hyades observations .",
    "it therefore follows that if the cluster binaries have a semi - major axis distribution that is comparable with the field m - dwarfs , then the implied f@xmath27 is @xmath38% . @xcite",
    "have pointed out that there is an apparent deficit of wide binaries ( @xmath39 100 a.u . ) amongst the hyades stars when compared with the field - star sample .",
    "this might reflect disruption of such loosely - bound systems over the lifetime of the cluster .",
    "our results for the late - type hyades stars can also be matched against the binary statistics for higher - mass cluster members .",
    "patince et al ( 1997 ) have completed infrared speckle observations of 162 main - sequence hyades stars with @xmath40 ( m@xmath41 ) , observations capable of detecting binary companions with @xmath42 arcseconds and @xmath43 magnitudes .",
    "eleven of the 162 stars ( or 6.8% of the sample ) have resolved companions within the range of angular separation matching the hst pc observations . since the k - band mass - luminosity relation can be approximated by m@xmath44 log(mass )",
    ", a magnitude difference of @xmath45 corresponds to a mass ratio of @xmath460.25 .",
    "thus , unlike our hst observations , in most cases the speckle data are incapable of detecting companions with masses close to the h - burning limit .",
    "one can allow for this incompleteness by adopting a mass function for the stellar companions .",
    "if that mass function matches the local field - star @xmath47 , then the observed binary fraction underestimates the true binarity _ for this range of separations _ by a factor of two ( see @xcite for full details ) . in that case , the f@xmath28 amongst the higher - mass cluster - members for companions with @xmath48 a.u .",
    "is @xmath49% - consistent with our observations of the late - type m - dwarfs in the cluster . with the relatively small number of stars in either sample ,",
    "however , the statistical significance of this result is not strong ,",
    "in their analysis of the later - type binaries amongst stars within 8-parsecs of the sun , @xcite argued that there was evidence for a bias towards equal - mass systems ; that is , the hypothesis that both the primary and secondary star are drawn at random from the same mass function was not consistent with the observed distribution of mass - ratio , q=@xmath50 .",
    "we can test this result using our hyades observations .",
    "table 2 lists mass estimates for each star in the resolved systems .",
    "these are based on the bolometric magnitudes , derived from m@xmath51 using the @xcite bolometric corrections . for stars fainter than m@xmath52 = 10 ,",
    "we have used the 600-myr x - models calculated by @xcite to estimate masses , while masses for more luminous stars are estimated from an empirical relation calibrated by the @xcite nearby - star speckle data . for these calculations",
    ", we again limit the sample to the six binaries which fall in the rgime where our data are capable of reaching the hydrogen - burning limit .",
    "the mass function for the local stars is well - represented by a power - law .",
    "@xmath2 ( reid & gizis , 1997 ) .",
    "dynamical effects are likely to have modified the overall hyades mass function , with preferential evaporation of lower - mass stars . however , while wide binaries may have been stripped , it is unlikely that the cluster dynamical evolution influences the companion - star mass distribution .",
    "we have used monte - carlo techniques to model the expected mass - ratio distribution amongst binary stars , generating companions ( mass @xmath53 ) to each star ( mass m@xmath54 ) in the current sample , with @xmath2 and @xmath55 .",
    "figure 2 compares the predicted mass - ratio distribution , f(q ) , plotted as a cumulative distribution , against the observed distribution . with only six binaries in the latter sample ,",
    "the statistical significance of the comparison is not overwhelming .",
    "however , three of the six stars are effectively equal - mass systems , and a kolmogorov - smirnoff test indicates that there is only a 10% chance of the observed distribution being drawn from the distribution predicted if the companion stars are selected from a @xmath2 mass function .",
    "thus , these data are consistent with the hypothesis that there is a bias toward equal - mass systems amongst m - dwarf binaries .",
    "the hst imaging data are also capable of detecting higher - mass brown dwarfs .",
    "three stars listed in table 2 have companions with masses in the range 0.11 to 0.13 m@xmath56 , although all are clearly above the hydrogen - burning limit . with a detection limit of @xmath13",
    "= 5 magnitudes for @xmath57 arcseconds , our deepest observations reach magnitude limits fainter than i=19.5 , corresponding to m@xmath58 , or m@xmath59 . in the @xcite models",
    "this luminosity corresponds to a brown dwarf of mass 0.05 m@xmath56 .",
    "since our observations extend beyond the hydrogen - burning limit , we can use these data to constrain the form of @xmath60 , the secondary star mass function .",
    "if we adopt a functional form for @xmath60 , we can calculate the expected relative number density of very low - mass ( vlm ) stars and substellar objects contributed by each star in our sample : that is , if @xmath61 and the appropriate limiting magnitude corresponds to m@xmath62 , or @xmath63 , then    @xmath64    that is , with a mass function increasing as @xmath65 towards lower masses , one predicts almost equal numbers of companions with masses between 0.05 and 0.1 m@xmath56 , and between 0.1 and 0.25 m@xmath56 .",
    "given that each hst observation has a different limiting magnitude , we can determine the corresponding mass limit , and derive the appropriate ratio for that star .",
    "summing the contribution from every star in the sample gives the expected relative numbers of stars and brown dwarfs detected in the present survey .",
    "since our observations are in the i - band , we need to determine the appropriate bolometric corrections to estimate the mass - limit corresponding to the limiting magnitude of each pc observation .",
    "a 0.055 m@xmath56 hyades brown dwarf is predicted to have a temperature of @xmath66 k ( burrows et al , 1993 ) and bolometric corrections remain poorly defined for objects of such low temperatures .",
    "however , gd 165b is estimated to have a temperature of @xmath67 k ( @xcite ) , and @xcite have determined a bolometric correction of bc@xmath51=1.75 magnitudes for that star .",
    "lacking other empirical results , we adopt a bolometric correction of bc@xmath51=0.3 magnitudes at m@xmath51=13 mag and assume a linear increase by 0.4 magnitudes per magnitude at fainter magnitudes .",
    "we can used the mass - luminosity relation defined by the @xcite models to transform the m@xmath52 detection - limit to a mass limit . however , these models are valid only if the hyades has an age of 600 myrs . while some recent analyses ( e.g. @xcite ) favour ages close to this value , other colour - magnitude diagram studies derive ages older by @xmath68 myrs ( friel , 1995 ) . clearly , the older the cluster , the lower the luminosity achieved by brown dwarfs of a given mass . to take this uncertainty into account ,",
    "we have also estimated mass - limits using the relation    @xmath69    where t is the age in years , and m the mass in jovian units .",
    "this relation , from @xcite , is based on brown dwarf cooling models , and is expected to be valid for brown dwarfs older than @xmath70 years .",
    "there are relatively small differences between the burrows _ et al . _",
    "x - models and this mass - luminosity relation for an age of 600 myrs .",
    "our calculations are therefore based on three brown dwarf mass - luminosity relations : the burrows _ et al . _",
    "x - models , and the @xcite relation for ages of 600 myrs and 1 gyr , taking the last as an upper limit to the cluster age .",
    "table 3 lists the results , where @xmath71 is the power - law exponent adopted for the mass function .",
    "we have divided the 0.25 to 0.05 m@xmath56 mass range at 0.10 and 0.15 m@xmath56 , and compare the observed and predicted numbers above ( * ) and below ( vlm ) the divide .",
    "the complete sample of six binaries defined above provide the empirical reference . while that reference sample is small in number",
    ", it is clear that , even for an age of 1 gyr , a companion - star mass function @xmath72 predicts almost @xmath73 too many objects with masses below 0.15 m@xmath56 . if the hyades age is close to 600 myrs , then even a flat mass function ( @xmath74 ) is inconsistent with the observations at the same level . these results , therefore , favour the hypothesis that both vlm dwarfs and brown dwarfs are infrequent companions to lower - mass m - dwarfs .",
    "we have completed our _ hst _ planetary camera search for lower - luminosity companions of a sample of fifty - three low - mass ( @xmath0 ) members of the hyades cluster .",
    "each observation is capable of detecting companions with masses at the hydrogen - burning limit where the projected angular separation is at least 0.28 arcseconds . setting the outer radial limit at the circle circumscribed by the pc image",
    ", this corresponds to linear separations of from @xmath75 to 825 a.u . at the average distance of the hyades cluster . in the case of the lowest luminosity stars",
