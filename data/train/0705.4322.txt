    "the speed of sound is important for two simple reasons : ( 1 ) it is a basic physical parameter that tells how fast the sound propagates in the system ; ( 2 ) it is intimately related to superfluidity according to landau s theory of superfluid . because of these , the sound propagation and its speed was one of the first things that have been studied by experimentalists on a bec since its first realization in 1995@xcite .",
    "the propagation of sound in a harmonically trapped condensate without the lattice has already been observed experimentally@xcite and studied theoretically@xcite .",

    "there have been a great deal of theoretical work done to understand the sound speed for a bec in an optical lattice .",
    "these studies show that three parameters strongly affect the speed of sound : the strength of the optical lattice @xmath0 , the interaction between atoms @xmath1 , and the lattice dimension @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the phonon excitations of the becs in one - dimensional optical lattice ( @xmath4 ) are theoretically investigated by solving the bogoliubov equations .",
    "their analytic results for the sound speed in the weak potential limit predicted that the sound speed decreases monotonically with increasing the depth of the optical lattice .",
    "the most detailed study of sound propagation in one - dimensional lattice was done by pitaevskii and stringari s group@xcite , who also found the sound speed is suppressed by the lattice . in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite presents the detailed comparison between the sound speed obtained by bogoliubov theory with the one obtained from the compressibility and the effective mass .",
    "similar results@xcite were also obtained for the krnig - penney potential , a special form of the periodic potential .",

    "et al._@xcite also studied the effect of the transverse degrees of freedom on the velocity of sound of a bec in 1d optical lattice and radially confined by a harmonic trap .",

    "most interestingly , with numerical calculations boers _",
    "et al._@xcite found that the sound speed of a bec in a three - dimensional optical lattice achieves a maximum with increasing lattice depth .",

    "our investigation here tries to overcome the deficiencies in previous studies to give a complete picture how the sound speed is affected by the lattice strength @xmath0 , the interaction between atoms @xmath1 , and the dimensionality @xmath2 .",

    "our analysis finds a strong dependence of the sound speed on the lattice dimensions .",
    "especially , we find that the lattice component perpendicular to the sound propagation increases the sound speed while the lattice components parallel to the propagation suppresses the sound speed .",
    "since the lattice can only be parallel to the propagation direction of sound in one dimension ( @xmath4 ) , the sound speed falls monotonically with increasing lattice strength . in two and three dimensions ( @xmath5 ) , there are both perpendicular and parallel components in the lattice and , therefore , there is a competition . as a result",

    "the analytical expression is found for compressibility @xmath6 and effective mass @xmath7 for a bec in an optical lattice .",
    "we find that the effect of the lattice on the sound speed reflects a competition between the slowly decreasing compressibility @xmath6 , and the increasing effective mass @xmath7 , with increasing lattice depth .    in the limit of strong lattices",

    "this @xmath2-independent behavior of sound speed can be understood as the competition between the tunneling strength @xmath8 between adjacent sites and the interaction @xmath9 between the atoms at a lattice site .",
    "with increasing lattice depth , @xmath9 slowly increases while @xmath8 exponentially decreases , resulting in monotonically decreasing speed of sound .",
    "our analytical results are complemented by our numerical study , where the results are obtained for all ranges of lattice strength .",
    "our numerical results agree well with our analytical results in both weak potential and tight - binding limits for the case of weak interatomic interaction . for the intermediate strength of lattice , we find that the sound speed even oscillates with the lattice strength for a three - dimensional optical lattice .",
    "we emphasize that in our numerical calculations the interaction between atoms is taken into account to compute the bloch states in all three dimensions . in ref.@xcite ,",
