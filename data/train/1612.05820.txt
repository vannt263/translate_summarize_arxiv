    "one of the main ingredients in stellar modelling are opacity data which affect energy transport and the structure of a star .",
    "in addition , the values of opacities determine conditions for excitation of heat - driven pulsations as observed , e.g. , in main - sequence or classical pulsators .",
    "the profound consequences that can result from the use of incorrect opacities was demonstrated some quarter of a century ago when the new data were computed by the two independent teams : opal ( iglesias , rogers & wilson 1992 , rogers & iglesias 1992 ) and op ( seaton 1993 , seaton et al . 1994 ) . since then",
    ", these opacity data were updated several times ( iglesias & rogers 1996 , seaton 2005 ) , but the main feature , i.e. , the new local maximum of the rosseland mean opacity , @xmath1 , at the temperature @xmath3 k , was identified in their first release .",
    "this new opacity bump , called the metal or z - bump , made possible , e.g. , to explain pulsations of b - type main sequence stars , decrease the mass discrepancy in classical cepheids and to improve the standard solar model ( rogers & iglesias 1994 ) .",
    "recently , the los alamos opacity database ( oplib ) was also updated ( colgan et al .",
    "2015 , 2016 ) and made publicly available ( http://aphysics2.lanl.gov/cgi-bin/opacrun/astro.pl ) .",
    "calculations with the oplib data yielded wider instability strips for pulsations of @xmath4 cep and spb type ( walczak et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "the most recent laboratory measurements at solar interior temperatures ( bailey et al .",
    "2015 ) indicate that the predicted rosseland mean opacities for iron are underestimated by about 75% . despite various improvements in the calculation of stellar opacities ,",
    "there are many indications that something is still missing in these data and/or has not been correctly included .",
    "one example is the b - type main sequence pulsators , which exhibit both pressure and high - order gravity modes , e.g. , @xmath0 eridani ( handler et al .",
    "2004 , aerts et al .",
    "2004 ) , 12 lacertae ( handler et al .",
    "2006 ) , @xmath5 pegasi ( handler et al . 2009 ) .",
    "there are also bags of such pulsators identified from the space data from _ kepler _ and _ corot _ missions ( e.g. , degroote et al .",
    "2009 , balona et al .",
    "2011 , 2015a ) .",
    "however , so far none of the pulsational models can account for their oscillation spectra .",
    "the higher iron opacity has been investigated very recently by theoretical computations of nahar & pradhan ( 2016 ) , but their results regarding a potential increase in total opacity have been criticized ( blancard et al .",
    "larger opacities could be a breakthrough in solar modelling and push in the right direction the seismic studies of massive stars .",
    "the increase of the z - bump opacity , mostly dominated by iron , was a first guess to explain the low frequencies detected in @xmath0 eri ( pamyatnykh , handler & dziembowski 2004 ) .",
    "recently , the instability strips for b - type main sequence models with enhancement by 75 % iron and nickel opacity were published by moravveji ( 2016 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we make an attempt to analyse once again this well - known hybrid pulsator , @xmath0 eri , which was observed by the brite - constellation ( weiss , ruciski , moffat et al .",
    "2014 ) . here , we base our studies on the pulsational frequencies extracted by handler et al .",
    "( 2016 ) from the brite light curves .",
    "our goal is to modify the profile of the mean opacity to reproduce both the observed range of frequencies and the values of the frequencies themselves .",
    "moreover , in order to control the opacity changes and make our results more plausible , we have imposed a requirement for the relative amplitude of the bolometric flux variations , the so - called parameter @xmath2 ( cugier , dziembowski , pamyatnykh 1994 , daszyska - daszkiewicz et al .",
    "namely , we demand , in addition , that the empirical value of @xmath2 for the dominant radial mode is reproduced by a model satisfying the above conditions .",
    "the use of the parameter @xmath2 significantly limits the modification of opacities because this parameter is very sensitive to the structure of subphotospheric layers where the pulsation driving occurs .",
    "in sect.2 , we recall the observed properties of pulsations of @xmath0 eri and compare them with the standard pulsational models . by the standard models we mean the models computed with the available opacity data : oplib , opal and op .",
    "sect.3 contains results of our modelling extended by the modification of the mean opacity profile and in sect.4 we reduce the number of such seismic models by taking into account the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the effect of convection in the vicinity of the metal ( or @xmath6)bump on pulsational properties of models with masses typical for @xmath0 eri is discussed in sect.5 . a kind of avoided - crossing phenomenon for radial modes identified in models with the modified @xmath1 profile is presented in sect.6 .",
    "we end with conclusions and perspectives for future works .",
    "the early b - type star @xmath0 eri ( b2iii , hd 29248 ) is one of the most studied hybrid pulsators in the last fifteen years .",
    "these intensive studies began with dedicated photometric and spectroscopic multisite campaigns carried out in 2003 - 2005 ( handler et al .",
    "2004 , jerzykiewicz et al .",
    "2005 , aerts et al .",
    "2004 , de ridder et al .",
    "the analysis of these data enriched the known oscillation spectrum by new frequency peaks , that complemented the two known @xmath7 triplets , as well as revealed the existence of high order g modes associated with low frequencies .",
    "subsequently , many theoretical studies have been devoted to finding the best seismic models that yield constraints on overshooting from the convective core , internal rotation and opacities ( pamyatnykh , handler & dziembowski 2004 , ausseloos et al .",

    "this star is a slow rotator with @xmath8 km / s ( pamyatnykh , handler & dziembowski 2004 ) but some suggestions about non - rigid rotation have been made ( dziembowski & pamyatnykh 2008 , suarez et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the brite project provided an opportunity , for the first time , to register the light variations of this bright star ( @xmath9 mag ) from space .",
    "handler et al . (",
    "2016 ) extracted from these data 17 frequencies : 10 in the high frequency range ( p modes ) and 7 in the low frequency range ( g modes ) .",
    "most of these peaks agree with the values derived from the previous photometric and spectroscopic observations . however , there are a few differences .",
    "firstly , five more g - mode frequencies have been detected .",
    "interestingly , the `` old '' frequency @xmath10 d@xmath11 is missing in this low frequency `` forest '' .",
    "moreover , two frequencies , one component of the @xmath12 triplet around 6.22 d@xmath11 and the peak around @xmath13 d@xmath11 , have not been found .",
    "these two frequencies had the lowest photometric amplitudes in the last photometric campaigns ( cf .",
    "table 6 in jerzykiewicz et al . 2005 ) . from a theoretical point of view , such a situation is quite plausible because the e - folding time for the amplitude growth of some pulsational modes in main sequence models may be quite short . for the quadrupole g mode with @xmath14 d@xmath11",
    ", we obtained an e - folding time of about 15 years and for the dipole and quadrupole p modes with @xmath15 and @xmath16 d@xmath11 , this time is of the order of several decades .",
    "these estimates , besides the detection threshold , can explain the appearance and disappearance of some frequency peaks .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the strmgren @xmath17 amplitude of the high order g mode @xmath18 d@xmath11 has dropped from about 5.5 mmag ( handler et al .",

    "the unstable modes have positive values of @xmath22 .",
    "there are shown modes with the spherical harmonic degree up to @xmath23 . the effective temperature and luminosity ( @xmath24 ) of these models",
    "are consistent with the observed error box determined with the new parallax @xmath25 mas ( van leeuwen 2007 ) : @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "here , we adopted a mass @xmath28 and metallicity @xmath29 .",
    "the values of ( @xmath24 ) differ only slightly between the models shown in fig.2 and their approximate values are : @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "all models reproduce the radial fundamental mode @xmath32 and the centroid of the dipole mode @xmath33 corresponding to the frequencies @xmath34 d@xmath11 and @xmath35 d@xmath11 , respectively . a small amount of core overshooting was needed to adjust the dipole mode frequency , which was chosen from the range @xmath36 .",
    "fig.2 recalls the old problem of mode excitation in the low frequency range , i.e. , high order g modes , as well as in the highest frequency range for @xmath37 d@xmath11 ( e.g. pamyatnykh , handler & dziembowski , 2004 ) .",
    "the widest instability in the p mode range is in the oplib models , reaching @xmath38 d@xmath11 , whereas for the op models we get the highest values of @xmath22 in the range of high order g modes .",
    "as we have checked , the changes of various parameters ( e.g. , @xmath39 ) within a range allowed by the observational error box do not eliminate these shortcomings . increasing the total metallicity , @xmath40 , enhanced an overall instability in both local maxima of @xmath22 .",
    "the effect of changing the mass is as follows : for higher masses we get the higher instability for the highest frequency p modes , e.g. , changing the mass from 9.0 to 10.0 @xmath41 extends the instability by about 1 d@xmath11 towards higher frequencies . on the other hand , for the higher mass models we get lower instability for low frequency g modes .",
    "thus , we can say that in the allowed range of parameters there are no models that can account for the whole observed range of frequencies detected in the @xmath0 eri light variations . in order to overcome this problem in the next section",
    "we try to modify the opacity profile , @xmath20 , and to find models that reproduce both the observed range of frequencies and the values of some individual frequencies .    , for representative models of @xmath0 eri , computed with the three sources of opacity data : oplib , opal and op .",
    "all models have @xmath29 , @xmath42 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and the overshooting parameter from the range @xmath36 . ]",
    "in this section we change some amount of opacity at the depths ( expressed in @xmath43 ) that can affect the driving of pulsations in the stellar models of @xmath0 eri .",
    "of course , these @xmath1 modifications will affect also the values of eigenfrequencies .",
    "the opacity profile is modified according to the formula @xmath44,\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the unchanged opacity profile and @xmath46 are parameters of a gaussian describing the width , height and position of the maximum , respectively .",
    "thus , for a fixed depth , @xmath47 , we enhance or reduce the opacity by changing @xmath48 .",
    "we adopted the gaussian because the known local maxima of the mean opacity profile are well represented by this function .",
    "examples of modifications of the oplib values of @xmath49 are depicted in the top panels of figs.3 and 4 for a model with the parameters @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , metallicity @xmath53 and core overshooting @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath1 derivative with respect to temperature , @xmath55 , is also shown , with its values given on the right - hand y - axis . in the first case",
    ", we increased opacities around @xmath56 and 5.46 by 100% ( i.e. b=1 ) , whereas in the second case ( the top panel of fig.4 ) , we added also 100% opacity around @xmath57 . within the z - bump",
    ", we have at @xmath56 the maximum contribution of iron to the opacity whereas at @xmath58 the maximum contribution of nickel occurs ( e.g. , salmon et al .",
    "adding 100% of the opacity only at @xmath56 increases the instability of both p- and high order g - mode frequencies whereas an additional increase of @xmath1 at the deeper temperature @xmath58 raises the parameter @xmath22 mostly for the low frequency modes .",
    "the opacity changes at @xmath57 are motivated by works of cugier ( 2012 , 2014 ) , who identified the new opacity bump around this temperature in the kurucz atmosphere models .",
    "this bump was suggested , for example , as a possible cause of excitation of low frequency g modes in @xmath59 scuti stars as detected in the kepler data ( balona , daszyska - daszkiewicz & pamyatnykh 2015 ) .",
    "the consequences of such @xmath1 modifications on pulsational properties are demonstrated in the middle panels of figs.3 and 4 . as an example",
    "we show the normalized differential work integral for the radial second overtone mode ( @xmath60 , p@xmath61 ) . in the model computed with the standard oplib data this mode is stable . increasing the opacity at @xmath62 and 5.46",

    "as one can see , an enhancement of the opacity at the depths @xmath56 and 5.46 causes an increase of the pulsational instability both for low and high frequency modes . in the low frequency range ,",
    "the quadrupole modes become unstable and dipole modes are not far from the instability .",
    "for the high frequencies , the instability range becomes much wider than the observed frequency range .",

    "the instability range of high order g modes is worse reproduced and all modes with frequencies below 0.35 d@xmath11 do not have their theoretical counterparts .",
    "there are only a few unstable dipole modes .",
    "quadrupole modes are more unstable but they are shifted to higher frequencies .",
    "this deficiency can be partially explained by rotational splitting , in particular , if the core was really spinning faster as suggested by pamyatnykh , handler & dziembowski ( 2004 ) .",
    "as we have mentioned at the end of the previous section , it is possible to find many models that can account simultaneously for the observed frequency ranges and roughly fit the values of some frequencies .",
    "thus , the question is : which modification of the opacity profile is more likely ?",
    "first , one can think about drawing some conclusions from chemical compositions determined from high - resolution spectra .",
    "such analysis by morel et al ( 2006 ) and , more recently , by nieva & przybilla ( 2012 ) points to normal ( solar - like ) abundances for @xmath0 eri .",
    "however , these photospheric abundances do not necessarily reflect the subphotospheric values .",
    "moreover , the values of opacities do not depend only on the abundance of individual elements but also on how they are computed ( e.g. , on the number of fine structure energy levels per ion taken into account ) .",
    "thus , we need an observable that would be sensitive to the opacity of the subphotospheric layers near the z - bump . such an indicator is the relative amplitude of radiative flux perturbation at the level of the photosphere , which is called the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the value of @xmath2 is complex and results from linear non - adiabatic computations of stellar pulsations .",
    "this asteroseismic probe was introduced by daszyska - daszkiewicz , dziembowski & pamyatnykh ( 2003 ) and in the case of b - type pulsators , it is strongly sensitive to the metallicity and opacity data ( daszyska - daszkiewicz , dziembowski & pamyatnykh 2005 ) .",
    "the empirical counterparts of @xmath2 are derived from multicolour photometry and radial velocity data by means of the method proposed by daszyska - daszkiewicz , dziembowski & pamyatnykh ( 2003 ) .",
    "an interesting result from the last studies of the parameter @xmath2 for @xmath0 eri is a preference of the opal tables by p modes and a better agreement with the op opacity models for high order g modes ( daszyska - daszkiewicz & walczak 2010 ) . here",
    ", we will make use of the empirical values of @xmath2 for the radial fundamental mode @xmath84 d@xmath11 derived from the strmgren amplitudes and phases and radial velocity variations from the last multi - site campaigns .",
    "it should be mentioned that the empirical values of @xmath2 weakly depend on the stellar parameters in the allowed ranges whereas they do depend on model atmospheres . in table1 , we give the parameters of the seismic models found in the previous section and depicted in fig.5 .",
    "there are also provided the theoretical and empirical values of the absolute value of the @xmath2 parameter , @xmath85 , and the phase lag , @xmath86 , for the radial fundamental mode of @xmath0 eri .",
    "the value of @xmath87 gives the phase shift between the maximum temperature and the minimum radius .",
    "the corresponding empirical values of @xmath85 and @xmath87 were derived by adopting both lte models ( kurucz 2004 ) and nlte models ( lanz & hubeny 2007 ) atmospheres .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as one can see , there are significant differences in the values of @xmath88 between models computed with different opacity data as well as a large disagreement with their empirical counterparts .",
    "thus now the aim is to find the @xmath89modified models that will reproduce additionally the empirical value of @xmath2 of the dominant mode .",
    "it appeared that fitting the parameter @xmath2 significantly reduces the number of seismic models .",
    "in fact , it is quite hard to find the models that simultaneously reproduce the observed frequencies , the range of instability for both p and g modes and the empirical value of the nonadiabatic parameter @xmath2 .     for the dominant frequency corresponding to the radial fundamental mode .",
    "the parameters of the model are : @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath29 , @xmath82 , @xmath92 .",
    "the values of temperatures and parameters @xmath48 at which the @xmath1 profile was modified are given in the legend . ]",
    "nevertheless , we succeeded in finding such a model with the oplib data and in fig.6 we depict its instability parameter @xmath22 as a function of the frequency .",
    "the model has the following parameters :  @xmath93 , @xmath91 , @xmath94 , @xmath29 , @xmath92 , and the modification of the opacity profile is :    * * bestoplib * : @xmath95 .",
    "our best model has a greatly reduced value of the mean opacity near the temperature @xmath96 .",
    "this was necessary to fit the empirical values of the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "on the other hand , the mean opacity has to be slightly increased near @xmath97 and significantly increased near @xmath98 in order to fulfill the instability requirement for p and g modes , respectively .",
    "the modified @xmath1 profile together with its derivative with respect to temperature , @xmath99 , is shown in fig.7 .",
    "the consequences of this @xmath1 modification on the flux eigenfunction @xmath100 are large as can be judged from fig.8 , where the absolute value , @xmath85 , and the phase lag , @xmath86 , are plotted .",
    "the photospheric values of the empirical @xmath88 are marked with the short horizontal lines .",
    "both , the absolute value , @xmath85 , and the phase , @xmath87 , are significantly modified around the minimum values of the the opacity derivative , @xmath99 , with the proviso that @xmath85 reaches the maximum values at @xmath101 where the derivative @xmath99 reaches the minimum , whereas the value of @xmath87 is the maximum at @xmath102 where @xmath99 obtains the maximum .",
    "it is worth mentioning that many models that reproduce the empirical parameter @xmath2 for the dominant frequency corresponding to the radial fundamental mode could not account for the instability of high order g modes .",
    "this is because to excite the g modes one has to increase significantly the opacity which , in turn , results in increasing the theoretical value of the phase lag @xmath87 .    despite such large modification of the opacity profile ,",
    "the value coming out of the photosphere is not much changed and the parameter @xmath2 is mostly adjusted to the empirical value by reducing the opacity at @xmath103 which does not affect the instability of g modes . the theoretical values @xmath85 and @xmath87 of the model from fig.6 and the corresponding empirical values are given in the last line of table1 .",
    "as one can see , the theoretical and empirical values of @xmath85 are in excellent agreement if the nlte model atmospheres are used . with the lte models ,",
    "the agreement is achieved if the @xmath104 error is allowed . for the argument , @xmath87",
    ", the compatibility is within the @xmath105 error regardless of which model atmospheres are used .",
    "for the model presented in fig.6 .",
    "the dashed blue horizontal line corresponds to the empirical values derived with the nlte atmospheres . ]",
    "despite the general considerations that convective transport is negligible in stellar models with masses corresponding to @xmath4 cep variable ( @xmath106 ) , it can be important at the depth where the local maxima of the opacity occur . as was shown by cantiello et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , the efficiency of the z - bump convection increases with increasing metallicity , decreasing effective temperature and increasing total luminosity .",
    "these three facts were confirmed by the observational data .",
    "moreover , fast rotation can enhance this subsurface convection ( maeder et al .",
    "2008 ) .    in the previous section we showed that the nonadiabatic parameter @xmath2 is a powerful probe of modification of the stellar opacities in the depth range @xmath107 .",
    "because of this important diagnostic property , here we will check the sensitivity of the flux eigenfunction @xmath100 to the efficiency of convection in the z - bump layer .",
    "the convective efficiency is measured by the value of the mixing length parameter , @xmath108 .",
    "we consider the modified op opacity profile with the parameters : @xmath109 , and the two values of the mlt parameter : @xmath110 and 5.0 .",
    "this second large value of @xmath108 is chosen , firstly , to show the effect and , secondly , because such values of @xmath108 were considered at some depth of the solar convective zone .",
    "the depth - dependence of @xmath108 was studied by , e.g. , schlattl et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and more recently by magic , weiss & asplund ( 2015 ) .     and @xmath111 .",
    "the corresponding values of the temperature derivatives of @xmath1 are given on the right hand y - axis .",
    "the parameter of the model are : @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 . ]    in fig.9 , we plot the standard and modified profiles of the rosseland mean op opacity ( the left - hand y - axis ) for the two values of the mlt parameter , @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath1 derivatives over temperature are depicted as well ( the right - hand y - axis ) .",
    "the model parameters are : @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 .",
    "as one can see , the change of @xmath108 is only revealed near the local maxima of @xmath1 .",
    "for the model with the modified opacity and @xmath111 , the efficiency of convection reaches about 45% in the vicinity of the z - bump layer .",
    "the effect of @xmath108 on the differential work integral is shown in fig.10 where its value is depicted for the radial fundamental mode , corresponding to @xmath116 d@xmath11 , and the high - overtone g mode , @xmath117 , corresponding to @xmath118 d@xmath11 .",
    "although the effect of @xmath108 seems to be negligible , the result is that in the model with @xmath110 the radial fundamental mode is stable whereas in the model with @xmath111 it is unstable because of smaller damping at @xmath119 and @xmath120 . in the case of the g mode ,",
    "the damping around @xmath121 is slightly reduced in the model with @xmath111 and the instability parameter , @xmath22 , is a little larger .",
    "profile ( cf .",
    "the effect of the mlt parameter is illustrated .",
    "for @xmath110 the @xmath122 mode is stable whereas for @xmath111 it is excited . ]    .",
    "the upper and bottom panels show the absolute value and the phase of @xmath100 , respectively .",
    "the dotted line corresponds to @xmath100 in the model with the standard op opacities .",
    "the short horizontal lines correspond to the empirical values derived with the nlte atmospheres . ]",
    "how the value of @xmath108 affects the flux eigenfunction , @xmath100 , is presented in fig.11 .",
    "the dashed and solid lines correspond to the opacity - modified models with @xmath110 and 5.0 , respectively .",
    "the model with the standard opacity profile is plotted with the dotted line .",
    "as one can see , the dependence of @xmath100 on the mlt parameter is important and the difference is larger than the observational error of the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the adjustment of the value of @xmath108 is beyond the scope of this paper but one has to keep in mind this fact when studying the properties of the z - bump in the @xmath4 cep star models .",
    "when studying models with the modified @xmath1 profile , we encountered the phenomenon occurring so far only for nonradial modes .",
    "it appears that in models with a significant increase of opacity at certain temperatures , the radial modes can experience the avoided - crossing phenomenon , which in standard massive main sequence models occurs only for nonradial oscillations . till",
    "now the avoided crossing for radial modes was noticed in models of neutron stars ( gondek , haensel & zdunik 1997 , gondek & zdunik 1999 ) and cepheids ( buchler , yecko & kollath 1997 ) .     from zams to tams , computed with the standard op opacities ( the upper panel ) and modified ones ( the bottom panel ) for the metallicity @xmath112 .",
    "in the later case , the opacity was increased by a factor of 4 at the depth @xmath123 . dotted vertical lines mark positions of the selected models before , during and after the avoided crossing of the fundamental mode and first overtone . ]    in certain cases , an increase of the local opacity produces the two resonance cavities for radial modes and low order overtones can exchange their dynamic behaviour in stellar interiors .",
    "an example is shown in fig.12 , where the evolution of eigenfrequencies of the six radial overtones for models with @xmath124 is shown .",
    "the top and bottom panels correspond to the standard and modified models , respectively .",
    "to emphasize the effect , in the modified model the op opacities were increased by a factor of 4 around the depth @xmath123 .",
    "as one can see , at certain evolutionary stages the first and second overtone radial modes @xmath125 or the fundamental and first overtone radial modes @xmath126 can get close to each other .",
    "the standard and modified @xmath1 profiles are depicted in the top panel of fig.13 .",
    "note that maximum difference in the opacity between two models is a factor of about 2.3 , not 4 , and the position of this maximum is at @xmath127 , not 5.35 , as in the standard and modified opacity tables .",
    "this is due to the fact that two evolutionary models differ one from another by distribution of both temperature and density in the interiors .",
    "therefore , the opacity coefficient is interpolated along different @xmath43 - @xmath128 lines in the tables .    during the avoided crossing of radial modes , overtones exchange their oscillatory properties , in particular the distribution of the kinetic energy inside a model .",
    "this can be seen from the lower panels of fig.13 where we show the run of the kinetic energy density as a function of the depth , @xmath43 , for the three lowest radial modes , @xmath129 , at three close evolutionary stages : before , during and after the avoided crossing of the fundamental mode and first overtone .",
    "these three selected models are marked in fig.12 by vertical lines . in this case after the avoided crossing the fundamental and first overtone modes exchange their dynamical behaviour in the interior : the distribution of the kinetic energy of fundamental mode is now very similar to that of the first overtone before the avoided crossing , and the distribution of the kinetic energy of the first overtone is very similar to that of the fundamental mode before the avoided crossing .",
    "it should be mentioned that during the avoided crossing both modes have the same normalized kinetic energy . at the closest approach",
    "the kinetic energy is nearly equally divided between the regions above and below @xmath130 , which is the lower border of the potential barrier formed by the opacity increase around @xmath123 .     as described in the text .",
    "the vertical line corresponds to @xmath123 at which the opacity was increased by 4 .",
    "the panels below show the kinetic energy density of the three radial modes in the @xmath1 modified models before , at and after the avoided crossing .",
    "these models are marked by vertical lines in fig.12 . ]",
    "seismic modelling of pulsating stars that exhibit both p modes and higher order g modes is still a challenging task . in this paper , we aimed at finding complex seismic models of the well - known pulsator @xmath0 eri which reproduce simultaneously the observed frequency range , the values of some individual frequencies and the empirical value of the nonadiabatic parameter @xmath2 for the dominant radial mode .",
    "we based our computations on the three sources of the most widely used opacity data , oplib , opal and op , and found that in each case only models with the modified profile of the rosseland mean opacity can account for the instability of the observed modes .",
    "a very important result is that adding the requirement of fitting the nonadiabatic parameter @xmath2 greatly reduces the number of @xmath1 modifications and , in fact , the good news is that it is very difficult to pick out such a model .",
    "we found that the model computed with the oplib data modified at the three depths , @xmath131 , best meets all the above conditions .",
    "thus , there is some indication that these opacities are preferred . a large increase ( more than three times ) of",
    "the opacity at @xmath132 was indispensable to get the instability of g modes whereas a reduction of the opacity by 65% at @xmath63 was imposed by the need of fitting the theoretical values of @xmath2 to the empirical ones .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that with the nlte model atmospheres we got much better agreement .",
    "it should also be highlighted that the opacity modifications can have serious consequences on the stellar structure . in this paper , we discussed an enhancement of the efficiency of convection in the z - bump if the opacity is increased . in turn , more efficient convection affects the mode instability and the flux eigenfunction .",
    "in addition , we found that in some models with the much increased opacity around the z - bump an additional potential barrier can be formed .",
    "consequently , the frequencies of the two consecutive radial modes can come close to each other and undergo the avoided - crossing phenomenon considered up to now only for nonradial modes in main sequence models .",
    "naturally a number of questions arise : to what extent are these opacity modifications realistic or , more precisely , are they in the right direction ?",
    "to what extent is the solution general ?",
    "can we apply it to other hybrid b - type pulsators ?",
    "a somewhat perplexing result is the need to lower the opacity at @xmath63 whereas the new local maximum of @xmath20 has been identified in kurucz models at this depth .",
    "this bump helped to solve the excitation problem with the low frequency modes in @xmath59 scuti star models which have much lower masses .",
    "can we have such differences in the opacity profile between stars ? or maybe our result is only a consequence of the adopted parametrisation to satisfy the data ?",
    "the large factor of increase that was imposed on the opacity at @xmath133 is also difficult to justify since our investigations have been unable to identify any missing transitions that would support such an enhancement .",
    "we will be able to try to answer all of these questions if more pulsating stars are analysed in the same way .",
    "we plan such complex seismic studies for the three other main sequence b - type pulsator which show oscillation spectra of a dual character : @xmath5 pegasi , 12 lacertae , @xmath134 lupi . a need for such significant modifications of stellar opacity can result either from non - homogenous distribution of chemical elements or from the present - day methods of the opacity computations .",
    "our main goal was to present a new approach to the analysis of the hybrid pulsators , which , besides complex seismic modelling , involves the fitting of the mean opacity profile .",
    "such analysis can lead to important constraints on opacities under the conditions of stellar interiors .",
