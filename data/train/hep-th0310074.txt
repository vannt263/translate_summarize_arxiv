    "since the discovery of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , superstring theories on ramond - ramond backgrounds have been studied extensively .",
    "these theories are also interesting because the rns formalism can not be applied ; one needs to use the green - schwarz formalism .",
    "the penrose limit of the @xmath4 background gives a pp - wave background which has been studied in the context of ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "these maximally supersymmetric pp - wave solutions of iib supergravity were considered in @xcite .",
    "the maximally supersymmetric pp - wave background supported by a constant r - r five - form field strength is also a useful framework , since the string theory on it can be solved exactly @xcite .",
    "since d - branes are expected to be dual to non - perturbative objects in gauge theory , they play an important role in ads / cft correspondence .",
    "d - branes on maximally supersymmetric pp - wave backgrounds have been studied in @xcite .",
    "one remarkable feature of the theories studied in @xcite is that in the light - cone gauge gs formalism , they result in massive theories on the world sheet .",
    "this means that one can not use conformal field theory when studying the physics from the two - dimensional point - of - view .",
    "the world - sheet theories of @xcite are free , however , so the spectrum of the light - cone gauge hamiltonian can still be easily found . however , this is not true for another interesting class of pp - wave type backgrounds which are solutions of type iib supergravity with non - constant r - r five - form field strength @xcite . in the case of flat transverse space",
    "these backgrounds provide exact solutions of superstring theory @xcite .",
    "string theories on these backgrounds give interacting @xmath0 or @xmath5 supersymmetric field theories on the worldsheet .",
    "the first class is parametrized in terms of an arbitrary holomorphic function which becomes the worldsheet superpotential in the light - cone gauge superstring action .",
    "generic superpotentials are massive , so conformal field theory can not be applied .",
    "one can obtain exact information about the spectrum in generic @xmath6 theories @xcite , but except in simple cases it is difficult to extract quantitative information from this formalism .",
    "it is therefore useful to study pp - wave backgrounds which lead to worldsheet superpotentials describing integrable massive theories . in these theories ,",
    "several techniques make possible the computation of the spectrum as a function of worldsheet mass and size .",
    "the technique we will utilize here is a generalization of the thermodynamic bethe ansatz @xcite to compute excited - state energies @xcite .",
    "in fact , the finite - size spectrum for the simplest @xmath0 massive field theory , that with superpotential @xmath7 , has already been derived @xcite .    in this paper , we discuss how to utilize these results in string theory on type iib supergravity backgrounds .",
    "the transverse target space is taken flat and non - compact .",
    "two of the eight transverse space directions are interacting while the others are free . on non - compact two dimensional space ,",
    "the 2d quantum field theory with the above superpotential has the spectrum consisting of kinks and antikinks interpolating between the two supersymmetric vacua . when considered on a cylinder , as necessary for closed strings , the states consist of pairs of interacting kinks and antikinks @xcite . in target space",
    "they correspond to strings interpolating between two planes sitting at the minima of the superpotential .",
    "the supergravity part of the string spectrum can be obtained by considering all states contributing to the string s point particle limit , which can be obtained by taking either the @xmath3 or @xmath2 limit . in the first case",
    "we obtain the type iib supergravity spectrum as the worldsheet theory reduces to a free massive theory in the limit . in the second case , strings with @xmath8",
    "explore the uv limit of the worldsheet theory , which gives the ir limit of the spacetime theory . in this limit",
    "we expect to obtain the iib supergravity spectrum but , as we will see , we do not obtain all of it . in the limit @xmath2 the supergravity part of the string spectrum comes from states with no kinks or antikinks , and no oscillation modes from the free part of the light - cone gauge string lagrangian . however , since there are no fermionic zero modes corresponding to the interaction part of the light - cone gauge string lagrangian , the clifford algebra satisfied by the gs fermionic zero modes is degenerate .",
    "this is different from the usual non - degenerate clifford algebra in the case of flat , usual pp - wave string theories or our case when the limit @xmath3 is considered . in the case where the superpotential is for only one of the four complex transverse coordinates of the string , the supergravity part of the string spectrum consists of 128 instead of 256 states corresponding to iib supergravity .",
    "this background has an @xmath9 global symmetry . under this symmetry",
    "we find the space - time fields associated to the supergravity part of the string spectrum .",
    "some iib supergravity modes are absent when @xmath2 , essentially because the world - sheet system is at strong coupling , far from the free - particle limit of @xcite .",
    "there has been a fair amount of related work on pp - wave type backgrounds .",
    "such backgrounds with non - trivial r - r fluxes or other fields , which can still be solved exactly at least in some cases , have been analyzed recently in @xcite . in general these backgrounds",
    "preserve 16 supersymmetries and the light - cone gauge string lagrangian contains harmonic oscillatory type terms in the fields .",
    "the question of the amount of surviving supersymmetry in d - brane configurations on pp - wave type backgrounds found in @xcite has been addressed in @xcite .",
    "a related background with localized d - branes solutions on general pp - wave backgrounds has been found in @xcite .",
    "other backgrounds producing interacting light - cone gauge string models have been considered in the past @xcite and more recently in @xcite .    in section 2",
    "we briefly review the general pp - wave solutions of type iib supergravity found in @xcite . in section 3",
    "we find the eigenvalues of the light - cone gauge string hamiltonian in the background corresponding to the superpotential @xmath1 .",
    "the supergravity part of superstring spectrum as well as its space - time interpretation is analyzed in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we discuss other cases when there are 2,3 or 4 interacting theories .",
    "also , we mention the background leading to @xmath10 supersymmetric sine - gordon theory on the worldsheet .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "maximally - supersymmetric pp - wave solutions of iib supergravity were considered in @xcite . strikingly , the world - sheet theory is massive , but since the fields are free , the eigenvalues of the light - cone superstring hamiltonian can still be found @xcite .",
    "the type iib supergravity equations also admit more general pp - wave type solutions of the form : @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the 8 transverse coordinates , @xmath14 and @xmath15 a four form in the transverse space .",
    "the transverse space can be curved .",
    "all other fields are zero except the dilaton , which is constant .",
    "the equations of motion of type - iib supergravity imply that the transverse space is ricci flat , the five - form @xmath16 is self - dual and that the four - form @xmath17 and function @xmath18 are related by : @xmath19=0\\ ] ] where @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the laplacian in the transverse space .",
    "since there are no other forms @xmath16 is closed which along with the self - duality of @xmath16 implies @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in complex",
    "coordinates the general 4-forms can be classified by the @xmath24 , the number of holomorphic and antiholomorphic indices , with @xmath25 .",

    "the amount of supersymmetry preserved by this pp - wave type background was studied in @xcite .",
    "the supersymmetry transformations are generated by a chiral spinor @xmath32 with 16 complex components . under the embedding",
    "@xmath33 the spinor @xmath32 is decomposed in positive and negative @xmath34 and @xmath35 chiralities ( @xmath36 are @xmath37 matrices ) : @xmath38 the amount of supersymmetry preserved is obtained by solving the killing spinor equation . to do this",
    "it is convenient to work in complex transverse space @xmath39 with @xmath40 however , later in this paper when we analyze strings on these iib supergravity backgrounds we switch back to real coordinates .",
    "two classes of solutions have been found in @xcite , for both flat and curved transverse space .",
    "the first class preserves at least four spacetime supersymmetries and the second at least two . for the flat case , which we consider in this paper",
    ", these solutions can be parametrized by a holomorphic function @xmath41 and a @xmath42 hermitian traceless constant matrix @xmath43 the killing spinors are : @xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are constant complex parameters . in the fock space formalism the vacuum @xmath48 and the filled state @xmath49",
    "are given by : @xmath50 in terms of @xmath41 the metric and the non - constant matrices @xmath30 and @xmath51 are : @xmath52 @xmath53 the second class of solutions , preserving at least two supersymmetries , are parametrized by a real harmonic function @xmath54 .",
    "the killing spinors are given by : @xmath55 @xmath56 the metric and the matrices @xmath57 are : @xmath58 @xmath59    in the rest of this paper , we consider only the first class of the above two sets of solutions .",
    "when strings are considered on the above pp - wave type backgrounds , the light - cone gauge can be implemented @xcite .",
    "we choose the light - cone gauge by setting @xmath60 , and @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the worldsheet time and @xmath63 the two majorana - weyl spinors .",
    "since @xmath64 they become the usual green - schwarz @xmath35 spinors @xmath65 in the usual light - cone gauge procedure , @xmath66 is conserved and the light - cone gauge hamiltonian is @xmath67 .",
    "the remaining killing spinors @xmath68 are those not annihilated by @xmath69 .",
    "these spinors survive as linearly - realized supersymmetries on the worldsheet .",
    "when all ramond - ramond fields are zero , the superstring action becomes an @xmath0 supersymmetric non - linear sigma model written in terms of a khler potential .",
    "when the r - r five - form field strength @xmath16 is turned on ( background ( [ back1 ] ) ) , one expects to still have a supersymmetric theory on the worldsheet , due to the preserved spinors @xmath70 as shown in @xcite , when the forms @xmath26 and @xmath27 are present one can add an arbitrary superpotential @xmath41 so that the worldsheet action in terms of the superfields is : @xmath71 @xmath72 where @xmath73 are chiral superfields with @xmath40 an interesting feature of this action is that it describes an interacting field theory . in complex coordinates we have the subgroup @xmath74 of @xmath35 , and",
    "a negative chirality @xmath35 spinor decomposes in spinors with vector indexes as @xmath75 .",
    "the transverse space is a ricci - flat khler manifold .",
    "therefore there exists a covariantly constant spinor , and a general spinor field can be expanded in terms of the  one - particle states \" @xmath76 ,  two - particle states \" @xmath77 , and so on , plus their complex conjugates . in the case of negative chirality spinors",
    "@xmath78 this decomposition defines the worldsheet spinors as follows : @xmath79 @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a covariantly constant spinor annihilated by all @xmath82    one can explicitly derive the action ( [ lagr ] ) in the manner of @xcite , where in the case of a non - constant r - r three - form field @xmath83 , a non - supersymmetric theory has been obtained on the worldsheet . in our case",
    "the starting points are the background ( [ back1 ] ) and the light - cone gauge green - schwarz lagrangian when r - r fields are present , which can be found in @xcite . the part of the metric proportional to latexmath:[$\\left    bosonic fields on the worldsheet .",
    "the part of the lagrangian connected to @xmath16 is proportional to @xmath85 choosing a convenient representation of the gamma matrices to solve the light - cone gauge conditions @xmath61 for @xmath78 , and then using the decomposition in ( [ spinors ] ) , the above term of the light - cone lagrangian turns into yukawa terms on the worldsheet . putting everything together",
    ", one then arrives at the action ( [ lagr ] ) when the forms @xmath26 and @xmath27 are turned on .",
    "the arbitrary holomorphic function @xmath41 , which parametrizes the background , becomes the superpotential on the worldsheet .",
    "a crucial question is whether the backgrounds reviewed in this section describe solutions of superstring theory .",
    "any action in light - cone iib gs formalism can be turned , by completing with a proper set of fields , into a theory which is classically @xmath6 superconformally invariant .",
    "if this new action is also @xmath0 superconformally invariant at the quantum level , the original light - cone gs background describes a solution of superstring theory .",
    "it has been shown @xcite by using the above procedure , known as the @xmath86 formalism , that the two classes of iib backgrounds found in @xcite are exact solutions of superstring theory when the transverse target space is flat .",
    "we have seen that superstrings in the above backgrounds produce , in light - cone gauge , @xmath0 supersymmetric interacting field theories on the worldsheet . in general the action of an @xmath10 supersymmetric theory",
    "contains in addition to the part in ( [ lagr ] ) an extra term @xmath88 which depends on a holomorphic killing vector @xmath89 including this term and setting @xmath90 by using the equations of motion , a general @xmath0 supersymmetric lagrangian is given , in terms of the component fields of the superfields by : @xmath91 where the last line represents the extra term @xmath88 , and the superfields are expanded as usual : @xmath92 since we have closed strings the worldsheet is a cylinder .",
    "the periodicity of the green - schwarz fermions leads to periodic boundary conditions on the worldsheet fermions .",
    "in general these two - dimensional theories are massive and , in our case , they are defined on a cylinder with periodic boundary conditions on all fields .",
    "if these theories on the worldsheet are integrable , it should be possible at least in principle to find the string spectrum .",
    "a simplification is to take a superpotential of the form @xmath93 so that we obtain four independent two - dimensional theories .",
    "we consider the massive integrable theory given by the superpotential @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the superstring coordinate in the 1-complex direction and @xmath96 real parameters . to find the eigenvalues of the string light - cone gauge hamiltonian we need to analyze the full worldsheet theory , while to find the supergravity part of the string spectrum we have to consider either the @xmath3 or @xmath2 limit of the worldsheet theory , which we will do in section 4 . in 2d language ,",
    "this integrable @xmath0 supersymmetric field theory is a relevant perturbation of the first superconformal minimal model @xcite .",
    "one can bosonize the fermions to obtain the ordinary sine - gordon model at a special coupling where it is supersymmetric , but we will continue to use the manifestly - supersymmetric language .    in superstring theory",
    "we take the transverse space to be flat : @xmath97 as shown in @xcite , in flat transverse space we have a holomorphic vector field @xmath98 , and it is related to @xmath99 as : @xmath100 however , we take the @xmath28 forms zero , @xmath101 , so that @xmath102 . for the above superpotential",
    "the metric and the anti - self - dual 4-form are : @xmath103 @xmath104 since we take @xmath41 to depend only on @xmath95 , the other theories in @xmath105 are massless and free and they can be easily solved . for this part",
    "one has the usual light - cone gauge hamiltonian consisting of a kinetic part and an oscillatory part expressed in terms of rising and lowering bosonic and fermionic operators : @xmath106 where the summation is over the free coordinates @xmath107 the occupation numbers expressed in complex coordinates are : @xmath108 @xmath109 as usual for a free hamiltonian the ground state of @xmath110 is defined by : @xmath111    to find the total light - cone string hamiltonian @xmath112 we need to find the spectrum of the interacting part @xmath113 , with lagrangian given by ( [ generalaction ] ) with @xmath114 when @xmath115 the theory becomes the flat space type iib superstring .",
    "we are interested in the superstring theory in the general pp - wave background with @xmath116 when at least four space - time supersymmetries are preserved .",
    "the parameter @xmath117 can be absorbed into rescaling of @xmath118 which corresponds to rescaling of light - cone gauge energy and @xmath119 ; so in fact @xmath117 can be set to a fixed nonzero value .",
    "therefore the eigenvalue configuration of @xmath18 depends on @xmath120 , but not @xmath117 ( other than just rescaling of energy ) .",
    "this is different from the maximally supersymmetric pp - wave background where any particular value of the background parameter is not special due to rescaling of @xmath121 it is convenient to rewrite the corresponding two - dimensional @xmath0 supersymmetric field theory in terms of canonical dimensionless fields .",
    "after re - scaling @xmath122 , we have @xmath123 dimensionless and @xmath124 a mass parameter .",
    "the action is then @xmath125 @xmath126    on the infinite line , the low - lying energies of many 2d lorentz - invariant field theories are written as @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the mass of a particle in the theory , and @xmath129 its momentum . if the particles are interacting , the energy of multi - particle states can not be generically determined , but the qualitative behavior can be described in terms of particles . because of the non - renormalization theorems in an @xmath0 theory , the particle content of the theory ( [ interact ] ) , can be inferred directly from the superpotential @xcite .",
    "the infinite - volume spectrum is described in terms of kinks interpolating between the vacua ; each kink is a supersymmetry doublet of fermion numbers @xmath130 and @xmath131 . in this model",
    "there are no breathers ; but they exist in the super sine - gordon case , which we will discuss later .",
    "bps kinks have mass @xmath132 where @xmath133 are the values of the bosonic field at spatial infinity for a kink in infinite volume . for the superpotential @xmath134 in ( [ interact ] ) the two vacua",
    "are at @xmath135 , so @xmath136 .    on a compact space , such as the one we have with circumference @xmath137 , finding the spectrum is a more difficult problem .",
    "even if the kinds of particles in the spectrum are known , their mass depends on @xmath138 ; in feynman diagram language this is because virtual particles can propagate `` around the world '' @xcite .",
    "the spectrum thus depends on the boundary conditions .",
    "here we take both the bosonic and fermionic fields to satisfy periodic boundary conditions @xmath139 . as mentioned in @xcite and @xcite , besides considering strictly periodic boundary conditions one may also impose identifications in the space of field configurations .",
    "this will modify the spectrum of the theory . at this point",
    "we can consider two situations .",
    "one is given by taking the identification @xmath140 in the space of fields .",
    "this means that the transverse space in the string light - cone gauge formalism is @xmath141 the other situation to consider , and the one we deal with in most of this paper , is the one with no identifications in field configuration , and the transverse space in string theory is then @xmath142 .",
    "the requirement of translation invariance along @xmath143 gives the restriction on physical states : @xmath144 is equivalent to finding the energy levels of the @xmath145-dimensional field theory with lagrangian ( [ interact ] ) on a circle of circumference @xmath138 . in the world - sheet theory ,",
    "the only two dimensionful quantities are the mass @xmath128 of the kinks , and the size of the system @xmath138 . on dimensional grounds , the energy can therefore be written in terms of a scaling function : @xmath146 .",
    "this means in terms of string quantities , the excited - state energies of the interacting part @xmath113 of the light - cone hamiltonian are @xmath147 where the scaling function @xmath148 , with @xmath149 , can be computed using the 1 + 1-dimensional integrability techniques .",
    "the above expression is valid for any @xmath150 or in string scale @xmath151 .",
    "note that regardless of the coupling no breather states exist , i.e. no small fluctuation modes at the minima of the superpotential exist , as one would expect .",
    "however , in the point particle limit @xmath152 with @xmath153 and @xmath66 fixed , the worldsheet theory reduces to a free massive theory with mass @xmath154 ( as @xmath155 with @xmath156 ) .",
    "this mismatching between the existence and non - existence of the fluctuation modes at the minima of the superpotential in the @xmath157 case and @xmath150 case respectively , signals that the two situations are infinitely far ( in the renormalization - group sense ) .",
    "we will discuss more this issue in section 4 .",
    "on general grounds , we know the ground state of @xmath113 with periodic boundary conditions has zero energy @xmath158 . in this case",
    "the witten index @xcite is two ; there are two bosonic ground states with @xmath159 and no fermionic zero modes .",
    "this is fairly obvious from the superpotential , whose bosonic part has two minima . since @xmath160 the ground state of the light - cone gauge hamiltonian @xmath112",
    "contains no oscillators from the free part @xmath110 .",
    "therefore the ground state energy of @xmath18 is just the kinetic part @xmath161 as usual there is a degeneracy associated with the fermionic zero modes from the free part @xmath110 , but now there is also a bosonic degeneracy coming from interacting part @xmath113 .",
    "however , in contrast with the flat space now there are fewer fermionic zero modes as there are no fermionic zero modes for the ground state of @xmath113 .",
    "there are two ways to take the string s point particle limit : @xmath2 or @xmath152 .",
    "it appears that here the two limits give different answers in contrast to flat space or the maximally supersymmetric pp - wave . in the first case when @xmath162 the expression ( [ exenergies ] ) is valid in the limit @xmath2 , all excited levels decouple and we are left with the two bosonic ground states discussed above .",
    "physically these states correspond to a point particle fixed at either @xmath163 or @xmath164 , but free in the other transverse directions @xmath165 in the other point particle limit , @xmath152 , we have a free massive theory on the worldsheet and we are left with an infinite number of states which do not decouple in the limit . physically the string reduces to a point particle in a harmonic potential @xmath166 at either @xmath163 or @xmath164 , but free in the other transverse directions . in the next section we will discuss the point particle string spectrum in more detail .    finding",
    "the rest of the finite - size spectrum is a much more difficult problem .",
    "however , some progress has been made in integrable field theories by using the thermodynamic bethe ansatz .",
    "usually this technique is used to compute the free energy for a system on the infinite line at some non - zero temperature @xmath167 .",
    "this amounts to computing the partition function on an infinitely - long cylinder of circumference @xmath168 , which yields the casimir energy of the system in size @xmath138 . with periodic boundary conditions around the cylinder ,",
    "the casimir energy here is exactly @xmath169 , as we have already indicated . in some cases ,",
    "however , one can continue the thermodynamic bethe ansatz equations to obtain the exact finite - size energies of excited states @xcite .",
    "one ends up with a set of coupled non - linear integral equations whose solution yields the energies .",
    "for the above action @xmath170 with periodic boundary conditions , this computation has already been done for states with total momentum @xmath159 @xcite .",
    "this analysis has been extended to find the @xmath138-dependence of single - particle states as well @xcite ; these one - particle states can appear when one takes the identifications in transverse target space @xmath171 in what follows we consider no identifications in the transverse space .",
    "since the analysis of @xcite is quite technical , we do not reproduce it here , but refer the reader there for details . in the @xmath172 limit ,",
    "the energy levels of the states found in @xcite are @xmath173 $ ] , @xmath174 . in the limit when @xmath175 is very large , the particles are far apart and effectively free . because of the periodic boundary conditions , the energy levels correspond to states with the same number of kinks and antikinks , each of mass @xmath128 .",
    "for example , the first excited level in the large @xmath175 limit consists of two free particles with momenta @xmath176 and total energy @xmath177 .",
    "the second excited state @xmath178 also represents two free particles , but now with momenta @xmath179 in the large-@xmath175 limit , it was shown in @xcite that the energies @xmath180 and @xmath181 , @xmath182 approach each other ; they correspond to states with @xmath183 kinks and @xmath183 antikinks .",
    "the energies @xmath184 , @xmath185 correspond to states with @xmath186 kinks and @xmath186 antikinks . these do not comprise all excited - state energy levels , but it seems likely that the techniques of @xcite could be extended to others if desired .",
    "away from large @xmath175 limit , one must take into account the interactions between the kink and antikink .",
    "we have numerically solved the non - linear integral equations found in @xcite for @xmath187 , and displayed the results in figure 1 .",
    "we consider only excited states of the two - dimensional interacting theory which have zero momentum @xmath159 , so that the physical states of light - cone string hamiltonian @xmath18 satisfy @xmath188 .",
    "apart from the continuous part @xmath189 the light - cone gauge hamiltonian has a discrete spectrum . on the same graph ( figure 1 ) viewed for a constant value of @xmath138 we can also represent the oscillatory part of @xmath110 depending only on @xmath138 , namely @xmath190 for @xmath191 .    :",
    "@xmath192 represented by continuous lines .",
    "the first three oscillator levels of @xmath110 represented by dashed lines .",
    "the energies are in units of @xmath193 while @xmath175 in string scale is @xmath194    thus all eigenvalues of the light - cone string hamiltonian @xmath18 can be obtained .",
    "they depend on the background inputs @xmath195 and on the string parameter @xmath196 the eigenvalue configuration depends non - trivially on @xmath197 the intersections of latexmath:[$\\frac{2n}{\\alpha '    @xmath175 ; in two different such sectors the eigenvalue configuration is different .",
    "for example , apart from the non - oscillatory part of @xmath110 , the first six levels of @xmath18 for @xmath199 are : @xmath200 while for @xmath201 they are : @xmath202    due to the fact that @xmath203 the string feels a gravitational force that pulls it to the regions where @xmath204 is minimum , namely the regions with @xmath205 ( @xmath206 ) . then kink - antikink pairs on the worldsheet going between minima @xmath207 correspond to a string that goes between the two positions where @xmath204 has a minimum in target space , namely @xmath208    as the ( infinite - volume ) kink mass @xmath128 gets bigger due to changes in background parameters @xmath195 , the oscillatory states of @xmath110 have lower energy than the massive states of @xmath209 . as @xmath210 with",
    "@xmath66 fixed , the states of @xmath209 effectively decouple . in the string scale , this limit corresponds to @xmath211 and/or to a very strong r - r field @xmath212 therefore in this limit the transverse space seen by the string in its excited states is six - dimensional and it consists in two hyperplanes sitting at @xmath213 and @xmath214 in this limit the string is highly excited in the free directions , and it is in the ground state in the interacting directions .",
    "alternatively , we can keep the background fixed , i.e. @xmath195 fixed .",
    "then the above limit is obtained for strings with very large @xmath119 , which is the ir limit of the worldsheet theory .",
    "it seems possible that in this limit it might be a correspondence between the string theory under discussion and a string theory on a partially discrete target space , e.g.  a transverse target space @xmath215 because of the uv / ir relationship between worldsheet and target space scales , the above discrete space appears at very short space - time scales .",
    "we now return to the low - energy states of @xmath18 and analyze the supergravity part of superstring , the  massless \" string modes .",
    "the supergravity part of string spectrum comes from all possible states giving light - cone energies which do not decouple in the limit @xmath216 while keeping everything else fixed .",
    "as we already mentioned , in the @xmath152 limit the worldsheet theory becomes a free massive theory . in this case , as in the case of the maximally supersymmetic pp - wave , we expect to obtain the usual type iib supergravity spectrum .",
    "as we have seen , the string s point particle limits @xmath152 and @xmath217 give different answers .",
    "in the first case we obtain the iib supergravity spectrum , but in the second case some of these modes are missing , as we will show in this section .    in the remaining of this section we analyze the supergravity spectrum obtained in the limit @xmath2 , which means the worldsheet radius @xmath218 , while everything else is kept fixed .",
    "as opposed to the case of a free massive superfield on the world sheet discussed in @xcite , only a few modes for the the theory discussed in section 3 remain in the @xmath2 limit .",
    "to explain this issue a little further , we amplify on a discussion in @xcite . a free massive superfield of mass @xmath219 on the world sheet of circumference @xmath138 results from the superpotential @xmath220 .",
    "the energy levels are are @xmath221 where @xmath222 is the world - sheet momentum .",
    "thus in the @xmath223 limit , all of these modes have very large energy except for the zero - momentum modes with @xmath224 . for a free massive superfield , there are an infinite number of these , because one can have as many zero - momentum bosonic modes present as desired .    the question to ask is then : what happens to these zero - momentum modes when interactions are included ?",
    "it is useful to answer this question first in the case of super sine - gordon , where the superpotential is @xmath225 , with @xmath219 a mass parameter and @xmath226 the usual coupling . in the limit @xmath227",
    ", this reduces to the free superfield , and we have an infinite number of zero modes .",
    "this fits in perfectly with the results from integrable field theory : in the limit @xmath228 there are an infinite number of `` breather '' states in the spectrum , which have masses @xmath229 .",
    "the kinks have mass proportional to @xmath230 in this limit , and so decouple .",
    "thus a state with a single breather of momentum zero will have energy @xmath231 for some integer @xmath232 .",
    "all of these states precisely reproduce the spectrum of a free superfield ( the analogous statement for the ordinary sine - gordon model is that @xmath228 spectrum is that of a single free boson ) .",
    "since the super - sine - gordon model is integrable for any @xmath226 , we can understand what happens to these states as one increases @xmath226 .",
    "what is known is that as @xmath226 is increased , the breather states drop out of the spectrum .",
    "this does not mean that there are discontinuities in the energy levels as a function of @xmath226  it means that a ( single - particle ) breather state turns into a ( two - particle ) kink - antikink state as @xmath226 is increased .",
    "one can see this explicitly in the bethe - ansatz solution of the ordinary sine - gordon / massive thirring model @xcite . for large enough @xmath226 ( @xmath233 in the usual normalization of super - sine - gordon ) , _ all _ of the breather states have dropped out of the theory . for ordinary sine - gordon ,",
    "this point is where the sine - gordon model is equivalent to a free dirac fermion , so we can easily see what has happened to the zero - momentum single - particle breather states : they correspond to a fermion and antifermion ( kink and antikink in the sine - gordon language ) with opposite momentum .",
    "the crucial point is that because here the excitations are fermions , there is only one state where both particles have zero momentum : the state with one fermion of zero momentum and one antifermion of zero momentum .",
    "this state can be identified with the breather of lowest mass .",
    "the higher zero - momentum breather states must therefore be identified with a state with fermion and antifermion , but where the two particles have non - zero individual momentum . in a finite - size system , these states must have energy proportional to @xmath234 , and so disappear in the small-@xmath138 limit .",
    "it would be quite interesting to confirm this by extending the computation of @xcite to compute the energy of the single - particle breather states in finite volume .    in the super - sine - gordon case",
    ", the same thing must happen  only two states of relative and total momenta zero remain at @xmath233 .",
    "( it is two here because there is a supersymmetric doublet of kinks of charge @xmath235 @xcite ; there are therefore two two - particle states of charge @xmath169 and individual momenta zero . )",
    "this follows from the fact that in all theories solvable by the bethe ansatz , the excitations are fermionic in that only one excitation of a given type is allowed per level ( for example , in ordinary sine - gordon , one can only have a single zero - momentum breather of a given type present ) .",
    "for super - sine - gordon , this fact was confirmed by the thermodynamic bethe ansatz computation of @xcite .",
    "therefore , all but two of the zero - charge zero - momentum states present as @xmath236 must have energy proportional to @xmath234 ( possibly multiplied by a logarithm ) by the time @xmath237 reaches @xmath238 .",
    "we have therefore argued that although there are an infinite number of low - energy states in the limit of free particles on world sheet , i.e. @xmath236 limit , only a small number of states survive for strong enough interactions in the case of super sine - gordon .",
    "let us see what happens when considering the superpotential @xmath239 studied above .",
    "in the small-@xmath138 limit , i.e. the uv limit on the worldsheet , the spectrum is that of the conformal field theory with superpotential @xmath240 , or in string scale @xmath241 ; with periodic boundary conditions this theory has only two ground states .",
    "all other states will have energy proportional to @xmath234 .",
    "another way of seeing how this can happen is by deforming the free massive theory : if one adds a superpotential @xmath242 to the @xmath243 , one obtains the @xmath239 theory ( the two are equivalent by a constant shift in @xmath244 ) .",
    "however , the conformal field theory with @xmath240 is infinitely far ( in the renormalization - group sense ) from the free massive superfield ; this must be so because the theories have different witten indices @xcite .",
    "this means that the conformal field theory with superpotential @xmath240 can not be reached by starting with a free massive superfield and adding small perturbations .",
    "thus it is not surprising that all but a finite number of low - energy states go away in the small @xmath138-limit .",
    "in fact , generically any worldsheet theory can effectively be described in the @xmath223 limit by a conformal field theory .",
    "because the only mass scale here is @xmath234 , all states other than exact ground states will have high energy .",
    "if the conformal theory consists of free superfields , then the corresponding supergravity spectrum will be the usual one .",
    "if the model is solvable by the bethe ansatz , then states will drop out of the spacetime supergravity spectrum unless the worldsheet spectrum contains an infinite number of particles .",
    "moreover , it seems likely generically , that states will drop out unless the interactions in the worldsheet conformal field theory are weak . to give a well - known example , in calabi - yau compactification ,",
    "the world - sheet theory is a sigma model with a calabi - yau manifold as a target space ; this can change the low - energy spectrum dramatically .",
    "we can see the effects of these considerations on our full theory by examining the fermion zero - mode spectrum explicitly .",
    "the ground state has a degeneracy coming from the two bosonic states of the interacting 2d theory .",
    "in addition there is the degeneracy from the algebra satisfied by the zero modes of the light - cone gs fermions @xmath245 and @xmath246 both having the same chirality , which we take to be negative .",
    "we need to find an irreducible representation of this algebra . as we already mentioned there are no fermionic zero modes in the interacting directions , and the other worldsheet fermionic zero modes satisfy : @xmath247 @xmath248 the gamma matrices in complex coordinates satisfy @xmath249=2\\delta_{i\\bar{i}}.$ ] as usual in complex space we also define @xmath250 , with @xmath40 they satisfy : @xmath251=2\\gamma_{i}\\delta^{\\bar{k}}_{\\bar{i } } , \\quad [ \\gamma_{i\\bar{i}},\\gamma^{k}]=-2\\gamma_{\\bar{i}}\\delta^{k}_{i } \\nonumber\\ ] ] a constant spinor annihilated by all @xmath252 can be taken to be @xmath253 then @xmath254 and similar expressions for the other actions of @xmath255 and @xmath252 on @xmath256 . using ( [ spinors ] ) one obtains the gs fermions @xmath245 and @xmath257 in terms of the worldsheet fermions .",
