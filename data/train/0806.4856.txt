    "high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) or above - threshold ionization ( ati ) owe their existence to the recombination , or elastic collision , respectively , of an electron with its parent ion or molecule @xcite .",
    "such processes take place within a fraction of a laser cycle , which , for a typical titanium - sapphire , high - intensity laser pulse is @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , hhg and ati occur within hundreds of attoseconds @xcite . as a direct consequence",
    ", one may use both phenomena to retrieve information from a molecule , in particular the configuration of ions with which the active electron recombines or rescatters , with subfemtosecond and subangstrom precision .",
    "concrete examples include the tomographic reconstruction of molecular orbitals @xcite , and the probing of structural changes in molecules with attosecond precision @xcite .    in particular diatomic molecules , due to their simplicity ,",
    "have attracted a great deal of attention tdse2005,doubleslit , kb2005,kbk98,mbbf00,madsen , usach2006,usachenko , henrikdipl , kansas , pracl2006,morecl , dm2006,hbf2007,f2007 . for such systems , sharp interference maxima and minima in the ati or hhg spectra have been identified , which could be explained by the fact that harmonic or photoelectron emission took place at spatially separated sites .",
    "therefore , a diatomic molecule may be viewed as the microscopic counterpart of a double - slit experiment @xcite .",
    "apart from the above - mentioned phenomena , nonsequential double or multiple ionization , may , in principle , also be employed to extract information about the structure of a molecule .",
    "this is not surprising , since laser - induced recollision also plays an important role in this case .",
    "the main difference from the previous scenarios is that the returning electron rescatters inelastically with its parent ion , or molecule , giving part of its kinetic energy to release other electrons . in particular , for the simplest case of nonsequential double ionization ( nsdi ) , this may occur through direct , electron - impact ionization , or by excitation - tunneling mechanisms , in which , upon recollision , the first electron excites the second .",
    "thereafter , the second electron tunnels out from an excited state .",
    "if more than two electrons are involved , there may exist more complex ionization mechanisms subsequent to recollision .",
    "recently , a statistical thermalization model has been proposed in order to account for these mechanisms and provide a simple description of nonsequential multiple ionization @xcite .",
    "specifically for nsdi of molecules , early measurements have already revealed that the total double ionization yields depend on the molecular species , and that there is an intensity region for which the predictions of sequential models break down @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent nsdi experiments on diatomic molecules have shown that the shapes of the electron momentum distributions depend on the symmetry of the highest occupied molecular orbital .",
    "this holds even if the molecular sample is randomly aligned with respect to the laser - field polarization @xcite .",
    "indeed , in nsdisymm , very distinct electron momentum distributions have been observed for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , as functions of the electron momentum components @xmath3 @xmath4 parallel to the laser - field polarization . for the former species , elongated maxima along the diagonal @xmath5",
    "have been reported , while , for @xmath6 the distributions exhibit a prominent maximum in the region of vanishing parallel momenta , and are quite broad along the direction @xmath7 .",
    "this has been confirmed by theoretical computations within a classical framework , which reproduced some of the differences in the yields .",
    "subsequently , it has been found that the peak momenta and the shape of the @xmath8 electron - momentum distributions changed considerably with the alignment angle of the molecules , with respect to the laser - field polarization @xcite .",
    "specifically , for parallel alignment , roughly @xmath9 larger peak momenta along the diagonal @xmath10 have been observed , as compared to the perpendicular case .",
    "furthermore , for perpendicular alignment , a larger number of events in the second and fourth quadrant of the momentum plane @xmath11 has been reported . in @xcite",
    ", these events have been attributed to excitation - tunneling mechanisms .    despite the above - mentioned investigations , nsdi in molecules",
    "has been considerably less studied than hhg or ati , possibly due to the fact that it is far more difficult to measure , or to model @xcite . solely from a theoretical viewpoint , even for a single atom , it is a very demanding task to perform a fully numerical , three - dimensional computation of nsdi differential electron momentum distributions , for the parameter range of interest . indeed ,",
    "only very recently , this has been achieved for helium ruizbeck , which is the simplest species for which nsdi occurs .",
    "an alternative to that are semi - analytical approaches , mostly within the framework of the strong - field approximation ( sfa ) .",
    "such methods are easier to implement and provide a more transparent physical interpretation of the problem .",
    "they exhibit , however , several contradictions .",
    "a concrete example is the fact that cruder types of electron - electron interaction , such as a contact - type interaction at the position of the ion , lead to a better agreement with the experiments as compared to more refined choices , such as a long - range coulomb - type interaction @xcite .",
    "apart from that , it is not clear whether the interference patterns due to electron emission in spatially separated centers survive the integration over the transverse momentum components .",
    "this is particularly important , as in most nsdi experiments , these quantities are not resolved .",
    "these issues add up to the already vast amount of open questions related to hhg and ati in molecules . indeed , even for these",
    "considerably more studied phenomena , topics such as the gauge dependence of the interference patterns @xcite , the role of different scattering or recombination scenarios @xcite , and the influence of collective effects @xcite or polarization dm2006,dressedsfa , bcm2007 on the electronic bound states have raised considerable debate .",
    "apart from that , specifically for nsdi , it is not even clear if the interference patterns would survive the integration over the transverse electron momenta .",
    "this is particularly important , as , in most nsdi experiments , the transverse momenta of the two electrons is not resolved .    in this paper , we perform a systematic analysis of quantum - interference effects in nsdi of diatomic molecules .",
    "we work within the strong - field approximation ( sfa ) and assume that the second electron is dislodged by electron - impact ionization .",
    "we also employ the classical limit of this model .",
    "we consider frozen nuclei , and the linear combination of atomic orbitals ( lcao approximation ) .",
    "this very simplified model has the main advantage of allowing a transparent picture of the physical mechanisms behind the interference patterns .",
    "specifically , we investigate the influence of the orbital symmetry and of the alignment angle on the nsdi electron momentum distributions , and whether , within our framework , the features reported in @xcite and @xcite are observed .",
    "furthermore , we address the question of whether well - defined interference patterns such as those observed in ati or hhg computations may also be obtained for nsdi , and , if so , under which conditions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ transampl ] we briefly recall the expression for the nsdi transition amplitude , which is subsequently applied to diatomic molecules ( sec . [ prefactors ] ) .",

    "in fact , in the length gauge @xmath28 and @xmath29 while in the velocity gauge @xmath30 and @xmath31 this is a direct consequence of the fact that the gauge transformation @xmath32 $ ] from the length to the velocity gauge causes a translation @xmath33 in momentum space .",
    "this is particularly critical for spatially extended systems , such as molecules , and may alter the interference patterns .",
    "a similar effect has also been investigated for high - order harmonic generation dressedsfa , f2007 and above - threshold ionization @xcite .",
    "these discrepancies can be overcome by adequately dressing the electronic bound states , in order to make them gauge equivalent @xcite . in this work",

    "thereby , we assumed that the first electron left at peak field and returned at a field crossing .",
    "this gives @xmath151 in the saddle - point equation ( [ saddle2 ] ) .",

    "these distributions are displayed in fig .",

    "indeed , both maxima and minima remain at practically the same positions , if different transverse momenta are taken . for this reason ,",
    "such patterns survive if one integrates over the transverse momenta .",

    "[ classical2](a ) and [ classical2](b ) , respectively ] , the maxima and minima agree very well with those in fig .",
    "the main difference , with regard to the quantum - mechanical case , is that , for large alignment angles , the classical distributions are more localized than their quantum - mechanical counterparts , especially in the low momentum regions .",

    "[ classical2](d ) , the yield is much lower near @xmath186 , as compared to the outcome of the s - matrix computation [ fig .",
    "[ diag](d ) ] .",
    "this discrepancy is possibly due to the fact that the classical model underestimates contributions to the yield near the boundary of the classically allowed region .",
    "in this work , we addressed two aspects of non - sequential double ionization of diatomic molecules : the influence of the symmetry of the highest occupied molecular orbital , and of the alignment angle , on the differential electron momentum distributions .",
    "we considered the physical mechanism of electron - impact ionization , within the strong - field approximation , and very simple models for the highest occupied molecular orbitals , within the lcao and frozen nuclei approximations .    for angle - integrated electron momentum distributions",
    ", we have shown that , for driving - field intensities within the tunneling regime and compatible with existing experiments @xcite , the distributions computed with symmetric and antisymmetric orbitals ( prefactors ( [ vpnkbond ] ) and ( vpnkanti ) , respectively ) , or different gauges , look practically identical .",
    "this is due to the fact that , if only electron - impact ionization is taken into account , the momentum region for which this process has a classical counterpart is too small to allow the corresponding pre - factors to have a significant influence . at first sight , this is in contradiction with the experimental findings and computations in @xcite .",
    "therein , a broadening parallel the anti - diagonal direction has been reported only for the anti - symmetric case , while , for a symmetric combination of atomic orbitals , an elongation in the direction @xmath163 has been observed .",
    "one should note , however , that , in @xcite , an effective , time - dependent second ionization potential @xmath187 is used @xcite .",
    "this feature has not been incorporated in the present computations .",
    "it has the effect of increasing the classically allowed momentum region and introducing an additional time dependence in the prefactors and the action .",
    "we have also made a detailed assessment of the interference effects due to the fact that electron emission may occur from two spatially separated centers . in order to disentangle the interference effects from those caused by the prefactor @xmath188",
    ", we assumed that the second electron was dislodged by a contact - type interaction at the position of the ions .",
    "we have observed interference fringes in the electron momentum distributions , along @xmath7 for all gauges and orbital symmetries .",
    "these fringes are most pronounced if the molecule is aligned parallel to the laser - field polarization . as the alignment angle increases , it gets washed out by the term ( [ fringesperp ] ) , which , for angle - integrated momenta , is essentially isotropic in the perpendicular momentum plane .",
    "consequently , the peaks of the distributions shift towards higher momenta , and their shapes resemble more and more those obtained for the same type of interaction in the single - atom case .",
    "we have also found that the prominence of such peaks will depend on the integration over the electron transverse momenta , so that some maxima may be more prominent than others .",
    "interestingly , we are able to observe changes in the peak momenta of the distributions , as the alignment is varied , even if a single physical mechanism , namely electron - impact ionization , is considered .",
    "these changes are caused by the two - center interference effects .",
    "this complements recent results , in which different types of collisions and double - ionization mechanisms are associated with changes in the peaks of nsdi distributions , within the context of molecules @xcite .",
    "finally , for laser - field intensities within the tunneling regime , the distributions obtained including only electron - impact ionization are far more localized than those reported experimentally , and the differences between different gauges and orbital symmetries are barely noticeable . in order to assess such effects , it was necessary to consider much higher intensities , for which other physical mechanisms , such as multiple electron recollisions , would also be expected to play a role @xcite",
    ". these discrepancies may be due to the fact that we are not including the physical mechanism in which the first electron , upon return , promotes the second electron to an excited state , from which it subsequently tunnels out .",
