    "ten years ago , low - energy scattering in two spatial dimensions ( 2d ) was studied for a large class of potentials @xcite .",
    "it was found that the s - wave phase - shift as a function of the momentum @xmath0 , @xmath1 , has a universal behavior = +  , as @xmath2 .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite for earlier studies , and @xcite for the case of non - central potentials .",
    "this behavior is radically different from that for three spatial dimensions ( 3d ) , where @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the scattering length .",
    "this universal behavior ( [ eq : tand1 ] ) is valid for most potentials in 2d , but there is a subclass of potentials where eq .",
    "( [ eq : tand1 ] ) does not hold .",
    "special cases of ( [ eq : tand1 ] ) have been studied earlier  @xcite .",
    "this universal behavior is the underlying reason why wire antennas are very efficient and widely used @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to obtain an approximate value for @xmath5 from this asymptotic formula ( [ eq : tand1 ] ) .",
    "the basic reason is that , since @xmath0 has the dimension of inverse length , the value of @xmath6 depends on the length unit used . in order to get a good approximate value ,",
    "we need some knowledge of the next to leading term , i.e. , we would like to rewrite the above result in the form  , for small @xmath0 , and obtain more information about the scale @xmath7 .",
    "what can @xmath7 be ?",
    "clearly it can not be universal . and",
    "it is reasonable to think that the value of @xmath7 is related to a scattering length .",
    "we recall that in 3d , the scattering length appears in two different ways . for small @xmath0 , we have @xmath8 ( with the convention that @xmath9 for a repulsive potential ) .",
    "but in addition , the scattering length , @xmath4 , can be defined by the zero of the reduced zero - energy asymptotic wave - function u_=c(r - a )  , we use this latter route to define a scattering length in 2d .",
    "we shall see that the scale in ( [ eq : tand2 ] ) is proportional to the inverse of @xmath4 , the value for which the zero - energy asymptotic wave function vanishes .    in sec .",
    "[ se : finite ] , we treat , for pedagogical reasons , the simple case of a potential with finite range . in sec .",
    "[ se : a-2d ] , we derive sufficient conditions on the potential for the existence of the scattering length in 2d .",
    "section  [ se:2 g ] is devoted to the case of weak coupling , where very amazing effects are observed .",
    "it also contains numerical illustrations which played a crucial in our preliminary investigations .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ se:2r ] , following the analogy with 3d , we question the validity of an `` effective range '' formula , and find sufficient ( and sometimes necessary ) conditions for the existence of the effective range .",
    "these conditions require a sufficiently - rapid average decrease of the potential at large distance @xmath10 .",
    "we also find what happens when the potential decreases less rapidly , behaving like negative powers of @xmath10 at large @xmath10 .",
    "finally , in sec .  [ se:3r ] , we return to the effective range in 3d , for the existence of which we believe to have the best sufficient conditions , in spite of the fact that the notion of effective range is known since a very long time and is well documented @xcite .",
    "as an example , we discuss the case of a finite range potential v(r)=0  , r > r  , the wave function for @xmath11 , is given by ( k , r)=c_0  , which has the asymptotic form c_0 ( k r + -/4 )  .",
    "we need to match at @xmath12 the external wave function ( [ eq : phiext ] ) to the internal one , @xmath13 , =  , where @xmath14 indicates derivation with respect to the second variable .    by an extension of poincar s theorem under conditions on @xmath15 to be specified later , we have , if @xmath16 = + ( k^2 )  .",
    "on the other hand , for small @xmath17 , the bessel functions are given by    j_0(z)&=1+(z^2 )  , + y_0(z)&=j_0(z)+ ( z^2 )  ,    where @xmath18 is euler s constant .",
    "the zero - energy wave function for @xmath11 is given by ( 0,r)(r / a )  .",
    "combining eqs.([eq : match1])-([eq : z - e - w - f ] ) , we obtain  , k0  .",
    "one should note that the 2d scattering length @xmath4 gives the value of @xmath10 where the asymptotic zero - energy wave function vanishes , in complete analogy to the 3d case .",
    "a major difference between the 2d and 3d cases is that , in 2d , the scattering length @xmath4 is _ always non - negative_.",
    "in this section , we start with the s - wave ( @xmath19 ) solutions , @xmath20 , which satisfy u(k , r)=0  . of the two independent solutions of ( [ eq : radialeq ] ) , under conditions on @xmath21 to be specified below ,",
    "we choose as a regular solution u(k,0)=0  , u(k , r)~ r0  , corresponding to a wave function @xmath22 which is finite at the origin .",
    "we introduce the green s function @xmath23 for @xmath24 , defined by g(r,r)=(r - r )  .",
    "this @xmath25 is given by g(r , r)=- ( r-r )  .",
    "the volterra integral equation that gives the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : radialeq ] ) guaranteeing eq .",
    "( [ eq : ureg ] ) is u(k , r)=u_0(k , r)+g _ 0^rrg(r , r)v(r ) u(k , r )  , where we set @xmath26 .",
    "we proceed to find a bound on @xmath27 which is uniform in @xmath0 .",
    "we start with the well - known result y_0(z)=j_0(z)+r(z )  , where @xmath28 as @xmath29 @xcite . in appendix [ se : appa ] , we prove that for any @xmath17 |r(z)| <  . substituting eqs .",
    "( [ eq : r ] ) and ( [ eq : boundr ] ) into ( [ eq : rgr2 ] ) , we obtain |g(r , r)| <  .",
    "now it is easy to show that 0<()+3^+r+^-r+3(+)(3 + )  , where ^+ r=    r & + 0 &    ^- r=    0 & + -r &    .",
    "hence |g(r , r)| < ( 3 + ) ( 3 + )  . using ( [ eq : boundg1 ] ) , we can deduce from ( [ eq : volt1 ] ) an integral inequality |u(r)| <",
    "+ ( 3 + ) i(r ) with i(r)=g_0^r ( 3+)|v(r)||u(r)|r  .",
    "this inequality can be easily integrated , giving i(r ) <  , and |u(r)|<2 ( 1+^+ r )  , so , if the integral _ 0^r(3+|r|)|v(r)|r  , converges , the iterative solution of ( [ eq : volt1 ] ) exists ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "we now proceed to derive an expression for the scattering length in 2d . recalling the remarks in the introduction , the scattering length in 3d",
    "is given by the value of @xmath10 for which the asymptotic reduced wave - function , i.e. , @xmath30 , vanishes .",
    "in the 2d case , u_=(a+br )  , and we thus define the scattering length as a=  .",
    "this shows explicitly that the scattering length is non negative .",
    "it is zero or infinity when @xmath31 .",
    "the reduced radial equation in a partial wave reads @xmath32 with @xmath33 . in the usual cases , @xmath34 , and the sign of the phase shift",
    "reflects how the effective potential departs from the pure centrifugal term . here",
    ", @xmath35 is the minimal admissible value .",
    "this is why , the departure due to @xmath21 seen in the low - energy phase - shift has always the same sign .",
    "the zero - energy limit of the integral equation ( [ eq : volt1 ] ) , with @xmath36 , is u_0(r)=+g_0^r ( ) v(r ) u_0(r)r  , it can be rewritten as = 1+g_0^ ( ) v(r ) u_0(r)r -g _",
    "r^ ( ) v(r ) u_0(r)r  .",
    "we define @xmath37 and @xmath38 as @xmath39 because of ( [ eq : intin3 ] ) , valid for any @xmath0 , these integrals converge . for the time being , we shall assume that @xmath40 differs from zero . if @xmath41 , this constitutes the exceptional case discussed in ref .",

    "we now get = 1-gx_2(g)+ gx_1(g)r + g _",
    "r^v(r ) u_0(r)r  .",

    "hence as @xmath2 , @xmath55 , we have ( k)-=(1 )  .",
    "this immediately leads to ( k)-=  .",
    "thus under our general conditions on the potential @xmath21 , the length @xmath4 completely determines the @xmath56 contribution to @xmath47 .",
    "notice that our conditions ( [ eq : intv1 ] ) and ( [ eq : intv2 ] ) , which can be summarized as _ 0^(1+|r| + ( ^+ r)^2 ) |v(r)|rr",
    "<  , are in fact _ weaker _ than those used in @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the case @xmath41 .",
    "notice first that if @xmath57 , @xmath58 because otherwise , from ( [ eq : volt1 - 0a ] ) we would get @xmath59 for @xmath42 , which implies @xmath60 .",
    "so for @xmath57 , @xmath61 , which corresponds to a zero - energy bound state and ( k)-((k/2)+)k0  .",
    "if @xmath62 is a value such that @xmath63 , @xmath37 has a _ single _ zero at @xmath64 , because the successive zeros of @xmath37 correspond to an increasing number of nodes for the zero - energy wave - function ( this would not be true for the non - central case ! ) .",

    "we will also explore further the behavior of the scattering length , @xmath4 , as @xmath68 .",
