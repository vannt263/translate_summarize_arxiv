    "the smoothed boundary method @xcite and other similar approaches @xcite have recently been demonstrated as powerful tools for solving various partial differential equations with boundary conditions imposed within the computational domain .",
    "the method s origin can be traced to the embedded boundary method and the immersed boundary method ( for an overview , see ref .",
    "this method has been successfully employed in simulating diffusion processes @xcite and wave propagation @xcite constrained within geometries described by a continuously transitioning domain indicator function ( hereafter , the domain parameter ) with a no - flux boundary condition imposed on the diffuse interface ( as defined by the narrow transitioning region of the domain parameter ) . while those works demonstrated the potential for this type of numerical methods that circumvents the difficulties with constructing the finite element mesh ( e.g. , meshing the surface and then building a volumetric mesh based on the surface mesh or by combining regular subdomains that can be easily meshed ) , which is particularly useful when dealing with complex structures . however , the method was only applicable to no - flux boundary conditions , and no approaches to extend the method to other types of equations or boundary conditions were available .",
    "recently , a different formulation , based on asymptotic analyses , to solve partial differential equations in a similar manner was proposed @xcite , providing a justification of the method as well as increasing the applicability of the approach .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a mathematically consistent smoothed boundary method and provide a precise derivation for the equations .",
    "the specific equations that we consider are : ( 1 ) the diffusion equation with neumann and/or dirichlet boundary conditions , ( 2 ) the bulk diffusion equation coupled with surface diffusion , ( 3 ) the mechanical equilibrium equation for linear elasticity , and ( 4 ) allen - cahn or cahn - hilliard equations with contact angles as boundary conditions .",
    "the method is especially useful for three - dimensional image - based simulations .",
    "the method is based on a diffuse interface description of different phases , similar to the continuously transitioning order parameters in the phase - field method @xcite often used in studying phase transformations and microstructural evolution in materials . in phase - field models , phases",
    "( which could be liquid , solid , vapor , or two different solids / liquids having different compositions ) are described by one or more order parameters having a prescribed bulk values within each phase . in the interface , the order parameter changes in a controlled manner .",
    "asymptotic analyses @xcite can be used to show that the phase - field governing equations approach the corresponding sharp interface problems in the sharp interface limit .",
    "we adopt this concept to describe internal domain boundaries by an order - parameter - like domain parameter , which may or may not be stationary and takes a value of 1 inside the domain of interest and 0 outside",
    ". the equations will be solved where the domain parameter is 1 , with boundary conditions imposed where the domain parameter is at the intermediate value ( approximately 0.5 ) .",
    "figure  [ domain ] illustrates a schematic diagram of the sharp and diffuse interfaces . in the conventional sharp interface description ,",
    "the domain of interest is @xmath0 and is bound by a zero - thickness boundary denoted by @xmath1 [ fig .",
    "[ domain](a ) ] . within @xmath0 ,",
    "the partial differential equations need to be solved according to the boundary conditions imposed at @xmath1 . in the diffuse interface description ,",
    "we employ a continuous domain parameter , which is uniformly 1 within the domain of interest and uniformly 0 outside . in this case , the originally sharp domain boundary is smeared to a diffuse interface with a finite thickness indicated by @xmath2 .",
    "our target is to solve partial differential equations within the region where @xmath3 while imposing boundary conditions at the narrow transitioning interface region where @xmath2 . by using this description ,",
    "there is no specifically defined domain boundary .",
    "the system will determine the boundary by a variation of the domain parameter .",
    "in addition , the gradient of the domain parameter @xmath4 will automatically determine the inward normal vector of the contour level sets of @xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "[ domain](c ) ) .",
    "the general approach is as follows .",
    "the domain parameter describes the domain of interest ( @xmath3 inside the domain , and @xmath6 outside ) .",
    "the transition between the two values described is smooth and taken as the solution to an allen - cahn type dynamic equation ( having a form of a hyperbolic function ) described later . to derive the smoothed boundary formulation for neumann boundary condition , the differential equation of interest ( @xmath7 )",
    "is multiplied by the domain parameter , @xmath5 . by using identities of the product rule of differentiation such as @xmath8",
    "we obtain terms proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "since the unit ( inward ) normal of the boundary , @xmath9 , is given by @xmath10 , such terms can be written in @xmath11 , and thus reformulated to be the neumann boundary condition imposed on the diffuse interface .    similarly , to derive the smoothed boundary formulation for the dirichlet boundary condition , the equation of interest",
    "is multiplied by the square of the domain parameter . again using mathematical identities , @xmath12 where @xmath13",
    ", we obtain @xmath14.\\ ] ] note that @xmath15 associated with @xmath16 appearing in the last term is the boundary value imposed on the diffuse interface .",
    "specific details of the derivation depend on the equation to which the approach is applied , and we therefore provide four examples below .      the first example is the diffusion equation with neumann and/or dirichlet boundary conditions . the neumann boundary condition is appropriate , for example , as the no - flux boundary condition , while the dirichlet boundary condition is necessary when the diffusion equation is solved with a fixed concentration on the boundaries . for fick s second law of diffusion ,",
    "the original governing equation is expressed as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the flux vector , @xmath19 is the diffusion coefficient , @xmath20 is the concentration , @xmath21 is the source term , and @xmath22 is time . instead of directly solving the diffusion equation , we multiply both sides of eq .   by the domain parameter @xmath5 that describes the domain of the solid phase : @xmath23 using the identity @xmath24 , eq .",
    "( [ mge5 ] ) becomes @xmath25 now , let us consider the boundary condition in this formulation .",
    "the neumann boundary condition is the inward flux across the domain boundary , mathematically the normal gradient of @xmath20 at the diffuse interface , and is treated as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the unit inward normal vector at the boundaries defined by the diffuse interface description .",
    "equation can be rearranged to be @xmath28 and substituted back into eq .  ;",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath29    to demonstrate that this smoothed boundary diffusion equation satisfies the assigned neumann boundary condition ( or specifying the boundary flux or normal gradient ) , we use the one - dimensional version of eq .   without loss of generality . by reorganizing terms and integrating over the interfacial region ,",
    "we obtain @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the region of the interface , and @xmath32 is the thickness of the interface . following refs .",
    "@xcite , we shall introduce the mean value theorem of integrals , which states that , for a continuous function , @xmath33 , there exists a constant value , @xmath34 , such that : @xmath35 where @xmath36 . by eliminating the second term on the right - hand side of eqs .   and",
    ", the no - flux boundary condition can be imposed ; the resulting equation is similar to those proposed in refs .",
    "however , we retain the term in order to maintain the generality of the method . therefore , the analysis presented here leads to an extension of the original method that greatly expands its applicability .    since the function on the left - hand side of eq .   is continuous and finite within the interfacial region",
    ", we can use the mean value theorem of integrals to obtain the relation : @xmath37 using the conditions that @xmath38 at @xmath39 and @xmath40 at @xmath41 , the first term in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "is written as @xmath42 since @xmath43 for @xmath44 or @xmath45 , the second term on the right - hand side of eq .   can be replaced by @xmath46 substituting eqs .  , and back into eq .  , we obtain @xmath47 taking the limit of eq .   for @xmath48",
    ", we obtain @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 when @xmath5 takes the form of a hyperbolic tangent function , and @xmath52 is the dirac delta function .",
    "the dirac delta function has the property that @xmath53 , providing the second equality in eq .  .",
    "eq .   clearly shows that the smoothed boundary method recovers the neumann boundary condition at the boundary when the thickness of the diffuse boundary approaches zero .",
    "this convergence is satisfied for both stationary and moving boundaries @xcite .    for imposing the dirichlet boundary condition",
    ", we can manipulate the original governing equation in a similar procedure to the derivation of eq .  .",

    "the oxygen vacancy concentration , @xmath20 , on the cathode surface is governed by fick s second law : @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the unit normal , primary tangent and secondary tangent vectors of the surface , respectively . here",
    ", the parameter @xmath73 is the characteristic thickness of the surface and is multiplied into the surface laplacian term to maintain the dimensional agreement of the equation .",
    "the parameters @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath22 are the bulk diffusivity , reaction rate , surface diffusivity , accumulation coefficient and time , respectively .",
    "thus , the term on the left - hand side represents the flux from the bulk , and the terms on the right - hand side represent the surface reaction , surface laplacian and concentration accumulation , respectively . for simplicity , these parameters are all assumed to be constant . in the bulk of cathode particles ,",
    "the oxygen vacancy diffusion is also governed by fick s second law : @xmath78 to simulate the oxygen vacancy concentration evolution in the cathode , the two diffusion equations , eqs .   and ,",
    "are coupled and need to be solved simultaneously . in this case , the two equations will share the flux normal to the cathode surface as the common boundary condition .",
    "recently , this set of equations was formulated using the concept of diffuse interface approach @xcite , which leads to two differential equations that are coupled by boundary conditions",
    ". we will show below that the coupling can be achieved by applying the smooth boundary formulation described herein to obtain one single equation that governs both surface and bulk effects .",

    "when the interfacial thickness approaches zero , eq .   will reduce to eq .   at the interface ( @xmath84 ) as has been proven in section [ diffeqn ] .    to calculate the surface laplacian , we use the following method .",
    "the unit vector of the concentration gradient is given by @xmath85 .",
    "the unit secondary tangential vector on the surface can be obtained by @xmath86 , and the unit primary tangential vector is then obtained by @xmath87 . in this case , the surface flux has no projection in the @xmath72 direction ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "we can calculate the surface diffusion flux along the primary tangent direction simply by projecting the concentration gradient into the primary tangential direction .",
    "the surface flux is calculated by taking the inner product between the concentration gradient and the unit primary tangential vector for magnitude , and it is along the opposite primary tangential direction : @xmath89 since the laplacian operator is independent of the selection of coordinate system , the value of the surface laplacian can be then obtained by taking the negative divergence of the surface flux : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the divergence of @xmath92 in the global cartesian grid system of the computational box .    to simulate only the surface diffusion on a diffuse - interface described geometry , one can simply eliminate all bulk - related terms to obtain @xmath93 such that only a concentration evolution along the interfacial region will occur .",
    "the smoothed boundary method can also be applied to the mechanical equilibrium equation .",

    "as three - dimensional image - based calculations are more prevailing in scientific and engineering research fields @xcite in which voxelated data from serial scanning or sectioning are often utilized and are difficult to render as meshes , the smoothed boundary method is expected to be widely employed to simulate and study physics in complex geometries defined by 2d pixelated and 3d voxelated data with a simply process of smoothing the domain boundaries .    * acknowledgements * : hcy and kt thank the national science foundation for financial support under grant nos . 0511232 , 0502737 , and 0854905 .",

    "<S> in this article , we describe an approach for solving partial differential equations with general boundary conditions imposed on arbitrarily shaped boundaries . a function that has a prescribed value on the domain in which a differential equation is valid and smoothly but rapidly varying values on the boundary where boundary conditions are imposed </S>",
    "<S> is used to modify the original differential equations . </S>",
    "<S> the mathematical derivations are straight forward , and generically applicable to a wide variety of partial differential equations . to demonstrate the general applicability of the approach , we provide four examples : ( 1 ) the diffusion equation with both neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions , ( 2 ) the diffusion equation with surface diffusion , ( 3 ) the mechanical equilibrium equation , and ( 4 ) the equation for phase transformation with additional boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> the solutions for a few of these cases are validated against corresponding analytical and semi - analytical solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the potential of the approach is demonstrated with five applications : surface - reaction diffusion kinetics with a complex geometry , kirkendall - effect - induced deformation , thermal stress in a complex geometry , phase transformations affected by substrate surfaces , and a self - propelling droplet . </S>"
