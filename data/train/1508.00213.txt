    "the past decade has witnessed a rapid development in the field of multi - agent systems and fruitful results have been achieved for the leader - following coordination problem . in recent years , distributed output regulation of multi - agent systems has been proposed to provide a general framework for leader - following consensus in linear or nonlinear cases @xcite .",
    "internal model approach , developed to solve the conventional output regulation @xcite , was effectively used for the distributed design , especially for nonlinear agents .",
    "for example , a cooperative output regulation problem was considered for a class of nonlinear uncertain multi - agent systems with unity relative degree in @xcite , while agents in the output - feedback form were considered with an autonomous leader and no - loop graph @xcite .",
    "it may be restrictive or unpractical if we always consider an autonomous leader without unknown inputs , especially in the case when the leader is an uncooperative target or contains unmodeled uncertainties .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to study multi - agent control when the leader contains ( unknown ) inputs .",
    "in fact , the generalized output regulation ( gor ) problem to track an exosystem ( or a leader ) with external inputs was discussed in many publications including @xcite and @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a distributed problem was investigated when the agent dynamics are double integrators to track a leader with an unknown but bounded acceleration in @xcite , and then a similar design was given in @xcite by assuming that the leader and followers share the same dynamics . to our best of knowledge , there are no general results on nonlinear multi - agent control when the unknown - input leader and the followers have different dynamics with external disturbances .    the objective of our paper is to study distributed output regulation for leader - following multi - agent systems with an unknown - input leader , whose dynamics is nonlinear and may differ from those of the followers .",
    "the contribution of the work is at least twofold :    * we extend the distributed output regulation to the case when the leader contains unknown inputs and has a dynamics different from those of the non - identical followers with ( unbounded ) local disturbances , and provide distributed controls to solve this problem in different cases .",
    "the results are consistent with the existing output regulation results when the leader does not have unknown inputs and the disturbances are bounded ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* we extend the conventional gor to its distributed version for multi - agent systems with an unknown - input leader .",
    "moreover , both global and semi - global results are obtained for nonlinear agents with unity relative degree , while only local results were obtained for a conventional ( single - agent ) case in @xcite .",

    "<S> in this paper , a distributed output regulation problem is formulated for a class of uncertain nonlinear multi - agent systems subject to local disturbances . </S>",
    "<S> the formulation is given to study a leader - following problem when the leader contains unknown inputs and its dynamics is different from those of the followers . </S>",
    "<S> based on the conventional output regulation assumptions and graph theory , distributed feedback controllers are constructed to make the agents globally or semi - globally follow the uncertain leader even when the bound of the leader s inputs is unknown to the followers .    </S>",
