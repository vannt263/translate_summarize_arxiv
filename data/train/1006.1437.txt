    "in 2008 , the belle collaboration reported their first observation of @xmath11 @xcite and @xmath12 near the peak of @xmath10 at @xmath13 gev @xcite . assuming that the observed signal events are only from @xmath10 , the measured partial widths for the final states @xmath14 and @xmath15 are @xmath16 mev and 0.067 mev , respectively , which are larger than the corresponding partial widths of @xmath17 @xmath18 @xcite by more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "the anomalously large partial widths in @xmath19 at the energy peak of @xmath10 have stimulated theorists interest for exploring the source , what results in these observations .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite suggested that the re - scattering processes of @xmath20 make a substantial contribution to the observed dipion transition of @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , they applied the same mechanism to the transition @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "they have found that the obtained ratio of @xmath22 to @xmath23 reaches @xmath24 , which is consistent with the babar measurement on this ratio @xcite . by the same mechanism ,",
    "meng and chao also studied the energy distribution of the dipion in the processes @xmath25 , and observed the energy dependence of @xmath26 to be different from that of @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "simonov and veselov investigated the dipion transitions of @xmath10 by using the field correlation method , which is similar to the re - scattering mechanism proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite in some sense .",
    "the obtained @xmath28 are in a reasonable agreement with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "since the resonant peak of @xmath29 appears at @xmath30 gev @xcite which deviates from the central mass of @xmath10 @xcite , theorists suggest that this enhancement may be explained by a mixing between the normal @xmath31 state with an exotic component , such as a hybrid state @xmath32 or a tetraquark state @xmath33 .",
    "let us have a closer look at the different explanations . by the initial state radiation ( isr )",
    ", the babar collaboration once announced their observation of a charmonium - like state @xmath34 by studying the @xmath35 invariant mass spectrum of @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "for understanding the data , theorists suggested different exotic structures for @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "hou then indicated that searching for the bottom counterpart of @xmath34 via @xmath37 would be an interesting topic @xcite .",
    "the observation of an enhancement at 10.87 gev in @xmath38 invariant mass spectra seems to advocate the existence of a bottom analogue of @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "karliner and lipkin proposed that the large partial widths of @xmath26 might be due to an intermediate state @xmath39 , where @xmath40 could be identified as an iso - vector charged tetraquark @xmath41 or @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "that is in fact an extension of the tetraquark explanation for @xmath34 given in ref .",
    "@xcite to the b - range .",
    "a different tetraquark structure : the lowest lying p - wave tetraquark @xmath43[\\bar b \\bar q]$ ] @xmath44 of @xmath45 with its mass equal to @xmath46 mev , was proposed by ali et al .",
    "@xcite . in their model ,",
    "the two light flavors in the tetraquark join to constitute a resonant state ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) which then decays into two pions .",
    "this mechanism can explain the anomalous @xmath50 production near the resonance @xmath10 and the structure at the dipion invariant mass spectrum as well as the @xmath51 distribution of @xmath52 by the belle collaboration @xcite , where @xmath53 is the angle between the momentum of @xmath10 and that of @xmath54 in the center of mass frame of the two pions .    in parallel to the interpretation which invokes the exotic structure of @xmath10 , alternative mechanisms",
    "have been suggested to stand for the anomalous @xmath38 production near the @xmath10 in @xmath29 processes .",
    "we can not rule out any of possible mechanisms that interpret the belle data until more evidence could support or negate some ( or just one ) of them .",
    "thus , further exploration is extremely necessary for determining the physics behind the observed phenomena .    in this work",
    ", we would like to further test the re - scattering mechanism proposed by the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite in the radiative decays of @xmath10 , namely @xmath0 .",
    "we suppose that @xmath0 radiative decay occurs via intermediate state @xmath55 .",
    "in fact , @xmath56 radiative decay is similar to @xmath57 , where one only needs to replace the effective vertices of @xmath58 and @xmath59 by the electromagnetic vertices @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively in the diagrams given in ref .",
    "the electromagnetic vertex is relatively simple compared to the hadronic one , thus for the low energy processes , as one writes the effective electromagnetic vertex as @xmath62 times the phenomenologically introduced form factor which is similar to the hadronic cases ( see the text for details ) , the results would be more reliable . in this work",
    ", we would take all inputs which were used in the references @xcite , except that at the electromagnetic vertex .",
    "thus , one can expect that the corresponding mechanism should enhance the ratio of @xmath63 . as a byproduct",
    ", we will extend the re - scattering mechanism in @xmath64 to study the radiative decay @xmath65 .",
    "the relevant phenomenological study of @xmath66 via the transitions @xmath67 and @xmath68 is carried out in refs . @xcite . in our recent theoretical work , @xmath69 without including re - scattering effect was calculated in the light - cone quark model ( lcqm ) , which indicated that the decay widths of @xmath70 and @xmath0 are of the same order of magnitude . after performing @xmath63 via intermediate state @xmath71",
    ", we can compare the results @xmath63 with and without including the re - scattering effect .",
    "recently the babar collaboration @xcite and the cleo collaboration @xcite have measured the mass of @xmath66 via @xmath72 , which makes us believe that @xmath73 can be measured in the near future . whether the re - scattering effect plays an important role in @xmath74 radiative decays will be tested by the future experimental measurement . moreover , the re - scattering mechanism for @xmath75 proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite can be tested .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . after the introduction , in the section [ sec2 ] we study the possible re - scattering effects on @xmath76 and present the numerical result .",
    "the last section is devoted to the conclusion and the discussion .",
    "as indicated in refs . @xcite , the re - scattering effect may remarkably enhance the rates of @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "thus , in this work we apply the same mechanism to study on @xmath80 radiative decay , where the transitions @xmath81 can occur via re - scattering sub - processes with the intermediate states being @xmath82 .",
    "the corresponding schematic diagrams are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fsi ] .",
    "cccc & + ( a)&(b ) + & + ( c)&(d ) +   + & + ( e)&(f )    the rest diagrams can be obtained by the charge conjugation transformation @xmath83 to diagrams ( a)-(f ) and the isospin transformation @xmath84 and @xmath85 to diagrams ( a ) , ( c ) and ( e ) .",
    "we need to emphasize that the diagrams corresponding to diagrams ( b ) , ( d ) , ( f ) after the isospin transformation are absent , since there do not exist the electromagnetic interactions of @xmath86 and @xmath87 .    indeed , since the intermediate states @xmath82 can be on - shell as described in fig . [ fig : fsi ] , both the dispersive ( real ) and absorptive ( imaginary ) parts of the loop contribute to the amplitudes of @xmath88 . in our earlier work @xcite , we investigated the contributions of the final state interaction ( fsi ) to the decay amplitudes of @xmath89 , where @xmath90 and @xmath91 stand as light vector and pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "interferences of the fsi contribution and the tree diagram result in the decay widths .",
    "however , for that case , the on - shell @xmath92 channels are not open because of the energy - momentum conservation ( the other channels with light mesons are highly ozi suppressed ) , therefore for the processes @xmath93 there is no contribution from the absorptive part , but only from the dispersive one .",
    "thus we only need to evaluate the real part of the loop . by fitting the decay widths of two channels we determine the model parameters ,",
    "one of which is for the form factor at the effective vertex and another for the interference .",
    "then we predict the widths of other channels and obtained results which are very close to the data .",
    "as well known , since the form factor is introduced , renormalization is automatically realized and this corresponds to the pauli - villas renormalization .",
    "fitting data of a few channels is just like the on - shell scheme .",
    "the key point is that once we have data to fit , we may more accurately estimate the contributions of ( may be ) both dispersive and absorptive parts . in general , when no enough data are available , accurate calculation of the fsi contributions is impossible .",
    "namely , one can only estimate their order of magnitude of fsi .",
    "that is our present case . by general arguments ,",
    "if the absorptive part exists , its contribution might exceed that of the dispersive part .",
    "anyhow , one can argue that they should have the same order of magnitude .",
    "moreover , it is noticed , the masses of @xmath75 are much above the thresholds of @xmath82 , and it implies that the imaginary part may be dominant . in refs . @xcite the authors made a clearer discussion on it .",
    "thus in this work , we only consider the contribution from the absorptive part to the decay amplitude , namely neglecting the real part would just be an estimate of the lower bound of fsi .",
    "the purpose of this work is to find an effective probe for the two mechanisms ( tetraquark structure or fsi ) which can explain the largeness of branching ratios of @xmath94 and @xmath95 with @xmath96 . since they lead to very distinct results for the widths of @xmath74 by orders , one can be content with the estimate of the only lower bound .",
    "the absorptive part of the decay amplitude of @xmath97 is expressed as @xmath98\\nonumber\\\\\\quad & & = 2\\big(m^{(a)}_c+m^{(b)}_c+m^{(c)}_c+m^{(d)}_c+m^{(e)}_c+m^{(f)}_c\\big ) \\nonumber\\\\&&\\quad+2\\big(m^{(a)}_n+m^{(c)}_n+m^{(e)}_n\\big),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the subscripts @xmath99 and @xmath100 denotes the decay amplitudes relevant to the intermediate @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively .",

    "@xmath105 and @xmath106 are the solid angle and linear momentum of the on - shell @xmath107 in the rest frame of @xmath17 , respectively . @xmath108 and @xmath109 are the amplitudes describing @xmath110 and @xmath111 by exchanging @xmath107 meson .",
    "the off - shell effect of the meson exchanged at t - channel is compensated by a monepole form factor which reflects the inner structures of the mesons at the effective vertex @xcite @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the momentum and the mass of the exchanged meson respectively . and",
    "the cutoff can be parameterized as @xmath115 with @xmath116 mev and dimensionless parameter @xmath117 being order of unit . later",

    "l    with all the parameter we can obtain @xmath148 kev which is four orders bigger than the direct transition ref .",

    "we explore the dependence of the width of @xmath149 on the cutoff @xmath151 and the results are depicted in fig.[ld ] , where we can find that the width increases with the increase of @xmath151 .    in principle , the diagram ( a ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : fsi ] can contribute to @xmath139 , but the mass of @xmath141 is just above the threshold of @xmath152 , so that the phase space would greatly suppress the contribution of the diagram and we obtain @xmath153 kev when @xmath151=200gev and @xmath154 which is still bigger than the widths of @xmath155 and @xmath156@xcite .",
    "the measurement on @xmath157 is important to test the re - scattering mechanism since the data can tell us the information about the parameters .",
    "it seems that the hadron re - scattering indeed enhances the decay rate of @xmath158 and we are expecting new data with great eagerness .",
    "the anomalous largeness of the branching ratio of @xmath159 stimulates a hot surf of theoretical studies .",
    "there are two possible interpretations which are based on different physics scenarios .",
    "the first is that the observed @xmath160 is a tetraquark @xmath161 or has a sizable tetraquark component . in this scenario ,",
    "the two light ingredients join to constitute a resonant state which later decays into two pions .",
    "this picture can explain the structure of the dipion invariant mass spectra observed by the belle collaboration .",
    "however , since the mechanism for the tetraquark - decay is governed by the non - perturbative qcd which is not fully understood so far , thus the the transition matrix element can not be reliably estimated . even though the picture seems reasonable , one is unable to quantitatively obtain the large rate .",
    "anyhow , it is one possibility .",
    "the alternative interpretation for the largeness is due to the re - scattering effects which occur at the hadron level .",
    "the dynamics of the re - scattering is clear , but the effective vertices must be determined by fitting relevant experimental data .",
    "moreover , for estimating the concerned feynman diagrams , a form factor which compensates the off - shell effects of the exchanged mesons must be introduced .",
    "all these uncertainties must manifest themselves in the theoretical predictions . even though the two scenarios suffer from theoretical uncertainties , they all offer possible interpretations for the largeness of @xmath159 and @xmath162 .",
    "thus one should testify them in relevant processes .",
    "our strategy is exactly based on this thought .    the re - scattering mechanism proposed by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite can greatly enhance the decay rates of @xmath159 and @xmath162 compared to the transition among lower resonances .",
    "in this work , we further testify the mechanism at the radiative decay of @xmath64 , where the effective electromagnetic vertex is relatively simple .",
    "our result which is obtained in terms of the lfqm , indicates the branching ratio of @xmath64 is not enhanced compared to that of @xmath163 as long as the re - scattering effect is not taken into account .",
    "however , there could be a four - order enhancement in magnitude for @xmath164 which is induced by the re - scattering effects .",
    "thus measurement of @xmath64 would be an ideal probe for the re - scattering mechanism which successfully explains the data of @xmath159 .",
    "by contrast , in the tetraquark scenario , the two light quark - antiquark would merge into an energetic photon . since a real photon",
    "can not be produced by annihilation of a massive quark and a massive antiquark , thus the quark and antiquark in the tetraquark must be much off - shell or exchange gluons with @xmath165 and @xmath166 , thus a suppression should be expected .",
    "thus the measurement on @xmath64 may distinguish the contributions of the two proposed scenarios .",
    "this is one of the tasks of the lhcb which will be operating very soon .",
    "if their results give a rather large decay rate on @xmath64 , it would be a strong support to the re - scattering mechanism .",
    "otherwise the tetraquark structure scenario would be more favorable .",
    "recently our experimental colleagues have made great progress .",
    "the babar and cleo collaborations succeeded to measure the mass @xmath167 and the @xmath168 and @xmath169 which offer an opportunity for us to study @xmath164 .",

    "<S> in this work , we investigate the re - scattering effects in the radiative decay @xmath0 , which were suggested to be crucially important for understanding the anomalous largeness of the branching ratios @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations show that the re - scattering effects may enhance @xmath3 by four orders , but the tetraquark structure does not . </S>",
    "<S> recently the babar and cleo collaborations have measured the mass of @xmath4 and the branching ratios @xmath5 , @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we hope that very soon , @xmath7 will be measured and it would be an ideal opportunity for testing whether the re - scattering or the tetraquark structure is responsible for the anomaly of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , the future measurements on the radiative decays of @xmath10 might be a touchstone of the two mechanisms . </S>"
