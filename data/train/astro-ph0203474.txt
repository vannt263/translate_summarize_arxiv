    "the luminosity - temperature relation for clusters of galaxies has presented a puzzle for a number of years . using simple analytical scaling relations , @xcite found that x - ray luminosity of clusters of galaxies should scale as @xmath18 .",
    "however , since the first compilations of the luminosities and temperatures for clusters of galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) , it has been clear that @xmath19 , a steeper relation than predicted .    one way to break the scaling laws that predict @xmath18 is to have non - gravitational energy injected into the intracluster medium ( icm ) before or during cluster formation .",
    "this solution , called pre - heating , was originally invoked to solve two related problems . @xcite and @xcite used pre - heating to explain the apparent negative evolution of the x - ray cluster luminosity function @xcite from the einstein medium sensitivity survey in an @xmath20 universe .",
    "@xcite also used pre - heating , in the form of supernovae - driven galactic winds , to explain why groups and low - mass clusters seem to have higher x - ray temperatures than expected based on galaxy member velocity dispersions , or @xmath21 .",
    "this is the same sort of behavior observed for the luminosity - temperature relation where the temperature is too high for the luminosity when compared with the highest temperature systems @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite showed clearly that the entropy of the icm in the center of low - temperature clusters is greater than the value expected from gravitational collapse .",
    "many authors have shown that this additional entropy can reproduce many x - ray observational properties ( * ? ? ?",

    "* for example ) .",
    "however , there are many different physical processes that could break the simple self - similar scaling , including heating from sn or from agn , or the removal of low - entropy gas via cooling ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) . to distinguish among these processes , the observations of high - redshift groups and clusters to measure the evolution in the observed scaling relations as a function of redshift will prove crucial",
    "in order to tackle the thermal evolution of the icm , we are examining the highest redshift sample of x - ray selected clusters of galaxies known , the ` rosat ` deep cluster survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "our goal is to observe all of the @xmath22 clusters in this catalog with the chandra @xcite and xmm - newton , thus creating a flux limited sample at high redshifts with high quality icm temperature and luminosity measurements .",
    "this will enable us to study both the luminosity - temperature relation and to determine the distribution functions of both of those physical measurements .",
    "in this paper we discuss our results for two clusters of galaxies from the rdcs , rdcs1317 + 2911  in  2 and rdcs1350 + 6007 in  3 .",
    "we then combine these data with our other observations of @xmath23 rdcs clusters of galaxies , along with a number of other high - redshift clusters , and examine the luminosity - temperature relation in  4 . in  5 , we discuss the lack of measured evolution of the luminosity - temperature relation and discuss how future surveys can improve upon our understanding of the thermal history of the icm .",

    "unless otherwise noted , errors represent 68% confidence limits .",
    "our optical data for rdcs1317 + 2911  are a 1200 second @xmath27 band from january , 1996 using the mayall 4 m telescope with the mosaic imager , and an 1880 second thuan - gunn i band image using cosmic @xcite on the palomar 5 m telescope . for the palomar data , we had moderate seeing , full - width at half - maximum @xmath28 , in non - photometric conditions .",
    "the data covered a 97 by 97 field of view with 02856 pixels .",

    "this camera provides a @xmath31 field of view with @xmath32 pixels .",
    "the flux scale was calibrated using observations of three ukirt standard stars obtained on the same night .",
    "the data were taken using a sequence of dither motions with a typical amplitude of 15 and a dwell time between dithers of 30 seconds .",
    "the data were linearized using an empirically measured linearity curve , and reduced using dimsum . in figure [ rxj1317s ] , we show a color - composite image from these data with the blue component from the @xmath27 band data , the green from the @xmath29 and the red from the @xmath30 data .    a catalog of objects in the @xmath30-band image was obtained using sextractor @xcite after first geometrically transforming the @xmath30 and @xmath29 images to match the @xmath27-band frame .",
    "the resolution of the ir images was also degraded slightly to match that of the @xmath27-band image .",

    "all detected objects down to this limit were inspected visually to eliminate false detections .",
    "the catalog was then applied to the @xmath29 and @xmath27 band images to obtain matched aperture photometry .    from these data we made color - magnitude diagrams , shown in figure [ rxj1317_cmd ] . in both colors",

    "the mask was observed in june of 1999 for three exposures of 1800 seconds with small offsets along the slits between exposures .",
    "we reduced the two - dimensional data using a set of iraf scripts optimized for lris observations .",
    "these scripts greatly reduce the fringing evident in lris spectra at long wavelengths when used on dithered observations .",

    "rdcs1317 + 2911  was observed by chandra , using acis - i , as part of our program to study the physical properties of the icm in all @xmath22 rdcs clusters .",
    "rdcs1317 + 2911  was observed for an effective exposure time of 111.3 ks ( obs i d 2228 ) on may 4th and 5th , 2001 .",
    "the observation was done with the very faint mode when acis was operating at a temperature of 120 c.    we processed the level 1 data for each observation using the ciao v2.1.3 software .",
    "we cleaned the level 1 event list for all events with asca grades of 1 , 5 and 7 , filtered the data not in good time intervals , removed bad offsets and removed bad columns .",
    "in addition , we used the routines in clean55.1.0 @xcite to remove particle background events from data taken with the very faint mode .",
    "we then removed , on a chip by chip basis , 3.3 second time intervals when the count - rate exceeded three standard - deviations above the average count - rate , @xmath39 @xmath401.25 counts per second .",
    "once we had created clean event files and corresponding exposure maps , we merged the chip by chip event lists into one event file for the whole pointing . for the level 1 processing , we used the acis calibration files that were available on june 1 , 2001 .",
    "in figure [ rxj1317s ] we plot our 0.5 - 2.0 kev data for this cluster , smoothed with a 3  gaussian and overlaid on our ground based imaging .",
    "overall , the cluster has a compact , highly elliptical shape . using the sherpa software package @xcite , we fit an elliptical @xmath9 model to the 0.5 - 2.0 kev photons .",
    "the resulting model had a core radius of 01 , and @xmath41 with an ellipticity @xmath42 and is centered at @xmath43 = 13@xmath4417@xmath452170 @xmath46 = + 2911181 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the errors on all of these parameters are too small , @xmath47 1% and the parameters appear quite different when compared with lower redshift clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "this is because the model does not describe the data well .",
    "as seen in figure [ rxj1317s ] , the x - ray emission from the cluster is not symmetric but rather appears to have a strong kink . also , the peak in the x - ray emission is off - center .",
    "when we examine the difference between the smoothed data and the best fitting model smoothed with the same gaussian , there is a clear over subtraction by the model in the center and an under subtraction at the edges .",
    "we measured an x - ray temperature for rdcs1317 + 2911  in the manner of our other chandra observations of rdcs clusters @xcite .",
    "first we placed a circular aperture of 30  over the center of the cluster as determined from the peak of the x - ray emission .",
    "we removed point sources from that aperture , including the hard x - ray source shown in the inset of figure [ rxj1317s ] . for a background region , we extracted two rectangular apertures on either side of the circular aperture . for each background region , we also removed point sources .",
    "the two background regions were constructed to have almost all of the flux land on the same node of the ccd as the cluster . for the background , we constructed weighted response matrix files and auxiliary response matrix files using alexey vikhlinin s calcarf / calcrmf tools ( which have become part of the 2.2 version of the ciao package ) .",
    "we fit the background regions with the xspec package of @xcite using a single component power law not convolved with the auxiliary response matrix as a model for the background from 0.5 - 6.0 kev with the addition of gaussian at 2.1 kev to model the au emission line .",
    "both regions were fit simultaneously with only the normalizations allowed to vary .",
    "we fit the data inside the 30  aperture using the cash statistic @xcite with a raymond - smith model @xcite and the above background model after rescaling for the relative areas .",
    "there were a total of 313 events in the energy range of 0.5 - 6.0 kev .",
    "we expected 137.7 events in the same energy range from the background .",
    "the small number of events in the cluster , 175.3 net events , means we can not constrain the abundance or redshift from our data .",
    "we , therefore , assumed a metal abundance of 0.3 solar @xcite and a redshift of @xmath48 for the cluster .",
    "we included a galactic absorption of @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "we found the best fitting temperature to be @xmath5 kev .",
    "we found , inside the aperture , a flux of @xmath50 ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) and @xmath51 ( 0.5 - 6.0 kev ) .",
    "we plot our best fitting spectrum in figure [ rxj1317_xray ] with the background model subtracted and the data grouped into bins of 10 events each . given the poor fit using the @xmath9 model , we used a curve of growth from the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band to determine the total flux . beyond a radius of 80",
    ", the total flux remains flat .",
    "we find a total luminosity within 1 mpc , 125 , of @xmath52 ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev , in the rest frame of the cluster ) and @xmath6 bolometric .",

    "is then performed .",
    "the errors are estimated from the distribution of the resulting temperature , flux and luminosity values . the median temperature , flux and luminosity values agreed with the input values .",
    "we also fit a power law model to the hard x - ray source in the core of the cluster .",
    "this source looks like a potential cluster member based on the colors of the galaxy aligned with the x - ray emission but currently it does not have a redshift .",
    "as this hard source sits on top of the cluster x - ray emission , we removed both the background and the cluster emission when determining the spectrum .",
    "we estimate a flux of @xmath53 ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) and @xmath54 ( 2.0 - 10.0 kev ) with a power - law slope of @xmath55 for the source .",
    "the optical counterpart for rdcs1350 + 6007  was originally observed using the mayall 4 m telescope with an @xmath27 band exposure . using that data , a mask was made for the cryocam spectrograph on the mayall 4 m telescope and three redshifts were measured in the cluster with @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 from spectra taken in april , 1996 .",

    "we show an image of the cluster in figure [ rxj1350s ] .",
    "the cluster redshift for rdcs1350 + 6007  was determined by searching for peaks in the redshift distribution that consisted of galaxies close to the x - ray centroid .",
    "there are seven galaxies in the redshift range @xmath59 that are likely cluster members .",
    "we used the same procedure as we used for rdcs1317 + 2911  and find @xmath60 for the redshift of rdcs1350 + 6007 .",

    "a 33 aperture was used and a 5 @xmath17 detection in that aperture is @xmath64 .",
    "we plot the color - magnitude diagrams for rdcs1350 + 6007  in figure [ rxj1350_cmd ] .",
    "the circled objects are galaxies with redshifts in the cluster",

    "the observation and initial event screening was done using the same parameters as rdcs1317 + 2911  as discussed in  2.2 .",
    "glancing at figure [ rxj1350s ] , it is clear that rdcs1350 + 6007  has more extended x - ray emission and has a much higher x - ray luminosity than rdcs1317 + 2911 . in figure [ rxj1350s ]",
    "we plot our 0.5 - 2.0 kev data for this cluster , smoothed with a 3  gaussian and overlaid on our ground based imaging . once again , using the sherpa package , we fit an elliptical @xmath9 model to the 0.5 - 2.0 kev photons .",

    "other than the high ellipticity , there is nothing unusual about these model parameters .",
    "the value for @xmath9 lies within the observed distribution of @xcite but does create a problem . at large radii , a @xmath9 profile has the observed distribution of @xmath69 , which , with our measured value of @xmath9 , yields a surface brightness profile @xmath70 .",
    "this means that the integrated flux of cluster increases logarithmically with radius so we can not use the @xmath9 model to calculate an aperture correction for a total luminosity at an infinite radius .",

    "+ 6007  we measured the x - ray temperature and flux inside an ellipse described by the best fitting @xmath9 model with the events taken from within one core radius .",
    "the one issue with this approach is that , as shown in figure [ rxj1350s ] , the cluster is asymmetric with more flux to the south - east than to the north - west of the cluster centroid . as with rdcs1317 + 2911 , we extracted a background region and fit a model to the background region .",
    "we chose a slightly more complicated model consisting of a gaussian and a broken power law not convolved with the auxiliary response matrix and we fit the energy range of 0.8 - 6.0 kev .",
    "we chose 0.8 kev for our cutoff in the energy range instead of 0.5 kev because of a noticeable change in our background regions below that energy . to fit this change",
    "would require a much more complicated background model than the broken power law and single gaussian we used .",
    "we rescaled the normalization of the background model and fit the cluster events with a raymond - smith model with a galactic absorption of @xmath71 @xcite . in this aperture",
    "we found 354 events from 0.8 kev to 6.0 kev , the energy range we fit the data and background over , while we expected 58 events from the background in the aperture . freezing the redshift at @xmath72 and the metal abundance at 0.3 solar",

    "the luminosity is @xmath75 ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev , in the rest frame of the cluster ) and @xmath76 ( bolometric ) within a radius of 1 mpc , using the @xmath9 model to compute the flux inside that radius .",

    "this abundance is quite high but requires a redshift in disagreement with the redshifts measured with optical spectra .",

    "an isothermal sphere with a @xmath9 density profile yields the following mass distribution @xcite , @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the mass enclosed within a sphere of radius @xmath89 .",
    "however , a few subtleties arise when comparing the x - ray inferred mass with that determined from the weak lensing analysis .",
    "first , the lensing returns the mass along the line of sight compared with the mass in a control aperture .",
    "hence , we need to calculate the projected mass distribution from the parametric model fit to the x - ray data .",
    "second , mass determinations from weak gravitational lensing analyses are necessarily lower estimates on the true mass along the line of sight .",
    "the observed shear is unperturbed by the addition of constant density sheets along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the relatively small field of view of these observations necessitates a differential determination of the total mass .",
    "this is facilitated by the statistic @xcite @xmath94 which measures the mean dimensionless surface density , @xmath95 , interior to radius @xmath96 , relative to the mean in an annulus @xmath97 , and depends only on the measured galaxy shear estimates , @xmath98 .    in order to do a meaningful comparison between the x - ray and lensing mass determinations ,",

    "we plot the 68% confidence lines on either side of the solid line representing the results from the best fitting @xmath9 model .",
    "the statistical uncertainty in the x - ray mass determinations was calculated propagating the errors in quadrature .",
    "it is apparent that our mass model based on the x - ray profile does not predict as high a mass as does the weak lensing shear signal . at large radii , this result is expected , as we show in figure [ rxj1350s ] .",
    "we have a non - azimuthally symmetric x - ray gas distribution .",
    "therefore , our circularly symmetric x - ray model will underestimate the total mass by neglecting the x - ray emission to the southeast .",
    "however , even at the core , our methods do not agree .",
    "weak lensing depends on the projected mass along the line of sight , so we could be observing a system with a significant mass in the foreground that can not seen in the x - ray emission .",
    "one such example of this is the cluster zwcl 0024 + 17 where the gravitational arcs @xcite and weak lensing @xcite imply a large mass near the cluster .",

    "such small values of @xmath9 and @xmath114 imply a small binding mass . with the galaxy redshift measurements from @xcite ,",
    "it is clear that zwcl 0024 + 17 is a merger along the line of sight , thus explaining the large lensing mass but the small gas mass implied by hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "such a line of sight merger could explain our small value for @xmath9 .",

    "the rdcs clusters are labeled with solid dots , rdcs j0152.7 - 1357 by an open square , rx j1053.7 + 5753 by a diamond , and all of the other clusters are represented by just error bars .",

    "in addition , we have made no corrections for cooling flow clusters .",
    "this means that the results of @xcite are the most comparable . using the data plotted in figure [ lt ] , we fit the luminosity as a function of temperature over the temperature range of 1 to 10 kev and found @xmath130 and @xmath131 using the bces method .",

    "surveys such as chandra multi - wavelength project ( champ ) @xcite and the proposed xmm survey of @xcite will provide the necessary follow - up of deep x - ray pointings to find the low - luminosity , low - x - ray temperature yet high - redshift clusters and groups . in figure [ newcl ]",

    "our weak lensing mass estimate is twice that of the mass we derive from the x - ray temperature and surface brightness profile .",
    "we speculate that we are observing a merging cluster .",
    "a merger along the line of sight would have a larger total mass in the weak lensing results than implied by the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium for the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "such an event could also serve to heat up the gas , breaking hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "thus , we could be underestimating the true slope of the gas profile , and therefore , the depth , of the potential well .",

    "we find with this sample a luminosity - temperature relation of the form @xmath160 where @xmath131 and @xmath13 .",
    "our results agree with the low - redshift luminosity - temperature relations @xcite .",
    "if we parameterize the evolution in the relation as @xmath161 , we find @xmath162 depending on which low - redshift sample we compare against .",
    "such evolution agrees with other measurements , such as @xmath163 by @xcite and @xmath152 by @xcite .",

    "thus , the 95% confidence limits encompass both combinations of redshift and temperature and all values in between .",
    "the observed infrared colors are more consistent with the lower redshift , however , so we will chose that value as the most likely .",
    "the flux inside the aperture was @xmath171 ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) and @xmath172 ( 0.5 - 6.0 kev ) for both temperatures , making the object almost as bright as rdcs1317 + 2911  in terms of flux , but slightly harder .",
