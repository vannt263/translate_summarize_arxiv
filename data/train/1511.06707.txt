    "[ sect_i_c_ew ] ) of the current burst of tol 65 agrees with the idea proposed by @xcite , in the sense that this galaxy is a young starburst embedded in a static hi cloud , which produces a damped ly@xmath0 absorption .",

    "[ figure_ratios_galaxies ] ) is slightly enhanced in this inter - cluster region which would be consistent with an enhanced contribution to the ionization / excitation by shocks .",
    "therefore , the gas ejected by massive stars within the star clusters grows close to the centre creating a high density region at the same time that the gas expands with velocities close or higher than the supersonic values ( with @xmath3110 km s@xmath13 ) into the surrounding region , then compressing the gas into high - density condensations and creating a low density region between the centre and the expanding high density shells .",
    "we found high fwhm values in the same area of high electron density in between the ghiirs ( see fig .",
    "[ figure_velocity_field_tol65 ] ) indicating that the turbulent motions in the ionized gas could be produced by winds from the main star cluster complexes .",
    "likewise , the expanding gas would cause the expansion in the surrounding material ( hi ) , so moving it out of the galactic plane .",
    "this agrees with the arguments proposed by @xcite and the evolutionary models by @xcite in order to produce a damped ly@xmath0 absorption .",
    "in addition , if the wind material contains enough dust , this outflow of gas would give rise to blueshifted velocities ( compared to the clusters ) observed in between the ghiirs because redshifted emission would be preferentially extinguished by the dust .",
    "in fact , the lack of ly@xmath0 emission ( see fig . 2 in * ? ? ? * ) and the detection of relatively high c(h@xmath9 ) associated with the most intense star - forming region in this galaxy , region no .",
    "1 , suggest that the ly@xmath0 photons have likely been destroyed by dust .",
    "this is in good agreement with previous findings by @xcite in the sense that dust extinction is an important ly@xmath0 escape regulator .",
    "a number of recent studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have suggested that local galaxies with cometary or tadpole morphology could have a variety of origins .",
    "@xcite suggest that most local tadpoles are bulge - free galaxy disks with lopsided star - formation , likely from environmental effects ( e.g , ram pressure , disk impacts or random collapse of local disk gas with an unstable jeans length ) .",
    "alternatively , propagating star - formation along the tail has been proposed by @xcite as one of the mechanisms that lead to the formation of the elongated underlying component or stellar tail of cometary hii / bcds .",
    "given that the starburst produces enough energy from stellar winds and supernovae ( sne ) , could the stellar feedback from the starburst have created the stellar tail in this galaxy ?    to create a @xmath51.5 kpc long extension in @xmath55 myr ( age of the current burst ) would require an outflow velocity @xmath5293 km s@xmath13 , while the difference between the velocities found in the field is @xmath5 50 km s@xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the current star - formation activity appears to be too young to have pulled out the surrounding gas and stars , driven a galactic outflow , to form the tail . on the other hand ,",
    "if the global starburst take longer @xmath510@xmath32 yr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as compared to the current burst , certainly it may promote the formation of gas outflows .",
    "after that some part of the gas could decelerate and collapse to form the stellar tail .",
    "if so , the close similarity between @xmath33 and @xmath34 agrees with this scenario , given that the diffuse gas will acquire the kinematical information of the system which is transferred into the ism by the star - formation activity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found that the relatively red colors of the underlying stellar component , in tol 65 , suggest a stellar population with a mean age of @xmath351 gyr .",
    "this stellar age is compatible with this idea , but the intrinsic youth of xmps is questionable @xcite and the evidence of such strong winds and the presence of extended ( @xmath361 kpc ) super - shells in low luminosity dwarf galaxies is also sparse . finally , we did not observe evidences of propagating star - formation along the galaxy and the presence of star clusters in the tail .",
    "thus , there seems to be no correlation between the star - forming activity and the formation of the tail in this galaxy , but from our present data we can not rule out completely this possibility .          in many respects ,",
    "the tidal hypothesis is an attractive one for the origin of the tail in tol 65 , given that tidal interactions enhance lopsidedness in low mass galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , hii / bcds tend to populate low - density environments and are not associated with massive galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggesting that tidal interactions with massive companions could not be the dominant starburst triggering mechanism .",
    "thus , the cometary or tadpole shapes among these may not generally be major mergers .",
    "we used the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) to search for nearby objects with measured systemic velocities .",
    "figure [ figure_field_tol65 ] shows the field on the plane of the sky of the galaxy .",
    "we find two galaxies , with measured velocities , in the field of tol 65 .",
    "the first one j122531.50 - 360715.3 is an irregular ( dirr ) and likely dwarf galaxy with a difference between their respective systemic velocities of @xmath37v = -4 km s@xmath13 .",
    "eso digitized sky survey ( dss ) images show that this object is highly disturbed with an apparent size of @xmath530@xmath38 equivalent with @xmath56.2 kpc , which is two times the apparent size of tol 65 .",
    "the projected distance between these galaxies is r@xmath39100 kpc .",
    "the other object in the field is the spiral galaxy eso 380-g029 . for this galaxy we found a @xmath37v = 1249 km s@xmath13 ,",
    "thus it is unlikely that this galaxy is producing the tidally - disturbed tail present in the galaxy , because companions with @xmath37v@xmath30 500 km s@xmath13 have not a significant dynamical influence @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the tail of the galaxy is oriented , in the plane of the sky , to this spiral galaxy .",
    "possibly eso 380-g029 had an stronger influence over tol 65 in the past ( several gyr ago ) , thus the tail in the latter could be a remnant of that tidal interaction .",
    "however , there is no observational evidence showing that this galaxy had an interaction in the past with tol 65 to produce a tidal tail . @xcite using vlt images suggested the presence of a low - surface - brightness companion galaxy of tol 65 , but it was discarded by @xcite .",
    "they found this object is in fact a background galaxy .",
    "thus , if this extended structure has a tidal origin with a close companion(s ) it may be related with a faint and massive one that have not been identified by optical surveys . in any case , j122531.50 - 360715.3 remains as the only potential perturber . in this sense , the slight enhancement of the sfr in region no .",
    "1 with respect to region no .",
    "2 and the lopsidedness of those star - forming regions could be the consequence of this tidal interaction . although it is unlikely that another dwarf galaxy of low mass , as it seems , could have a tidal effect at this distance . from the present observations we can not say much about the impact of j122531.50 - 360715.3 over the physical properties of tol 65",
    "but we speculate based on the aforementioned arguments that the co - evolution on these systems play an important role in the enhancement of star - formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and evolution in many of these galaxies @xcite .",
    "several studies have shown that a number of star - forming dwarf galaxies present filamentary hi and/or extended structures , which may indicate a recent cold gas infall / accretion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and/or minor merger / interaction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ", the extended structure of this galaxy could be a remnant of one of these processes .",
    "@xcite argue that if the stars are being formed as a consequence of the infall they will be formed along the path of the accretion .",
    "but , we did not observe the presence of star clusters in the tail of the galaxy . then , alternatively , the effect of these interactions has carried away in the recent past an important fraction of gas and stars to form the stellar tail . the fact that @xmath40 ( see sect .",
    "[ sect_velocity_field ] ) implies that the ionized gas still , on a global scale , retains the kinematic memory of its parental cloud and likely a common origin . while extended regions of diffuse gas are highly disturbed , probably due to unresolved expanding shells and the effects of massive star evolution .",
    "therefore , we interpreted the observed properties of the ism and the morphology of the galaxy as due to a late - stage minor merger and/or inflow of metal - poor gas in the recent past of the galaxy .      if the current star - forming episode in xmps is the consequence of the infall of metal - poor gas , the less enriched gas dilutes the preexisting nuclear gas to produce a lower metallicity than would be obtained prior to the accretion .",
    "@xcite argue that such accretion flows could explain all the major xmp properties such as , i.e. , isolation , lack of interaction / merger signatures , metal - poor hi gas , metallicity inhomogeneities , etc .",
    "in this sense , @xcite argue that the variation of oxygen abundance along the major axis of two xmp star - forming dwarf galaxies can be interpreted as an early stage of assembling in disk galaxies with the star - formation sustained by external metal - poor gas accretion likely from the cosmic web @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we studied one of the objects analyzed by @xcite , the xmp galaxy hs 2236 + 1344 . in this study",
    ", we found indications of variation of o and n / o associated with the less luminous star - formation region of that galaxy . but given the uncertainties related to those measurements we considered the abundances across the galaxy as fairly uniform .",
    "since most of our hii / bcd galaxies @xcite , and xmp / bcds from the literature ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see references therein ) studied so far are chemically homogeneous it seems that these galaxies have mixed up the metals with the pre - existing ism before the current starburst appears .",
    "the newly synthesized metals from the current star - formation episode reside in a hot gas phase ( t @xmath41 10@xmath42 k ) and those will be dispersed probably in the whole galaxy by the expansion of starburst - driven outflows .",
    "the energy injected by stellar winds and sne may be able to eject part of the enriched gas into the intergalactic medium , but in most cases the expanding velocity ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) are not sufficient to allow the gas to escape from the potential well of the galaxies . in addition ,",
    "inflows or accretion of relatively low metallicity gas could possibly dilute more easily the abundance of the gas on large scales . assuming a sound speed of @xmath512 km s@xmath13 ( see sect . [ sect_velocity_field ] ) as the expected speed",
    "at which mixing occurs in tol 65 , we found that over 1.5 - 2.0 kpc it yields @xmath510@xmath32yr , which is similar to the timescale required for cooling and dispersal of metals produced by massive stars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) as observed in compact hii / bcd galaxies ( e.g. um 408 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "consequently , the predominant mechanism for metal transport may not be resolved in star - forming dwarf galaxies .",
    "however , if we interpreted the observed properties of the ism as due to a late stage - merger and/or inflow of metal - poor gas , the accreted gas must be almost fully diluted as seen in fig .",
    "[ figure_sfr_oh ] .",
    "therefore , the final mixture of gas thus depends on the relative enrichment of the acquired and pre - enriched gas .",
    "@xcite showed that the neutral gas metallicity , in a sample of bcds , is equal or lower than the ones found in the hii region .",
    "this agree with the results obtained by @xcite , using the cosmic origin spectrograph ( cos ) onboard hst , in the sense that the hi gas abundances is factor @xmath52 lower than the warm gas abundance in i zw18 indicating that infall of , non fully pristine , metal - poor gas could be the responsible for its low metallicity .",
    "therefore , we can not exclude that the tail in this xmp galaxy could be made from a gas with much lower metallicity than that in the warm gas phase .",
    "however , we still lack an adequate explanation about the evolutionary status of tol 65 since no spatially resolved hi observations are available , but the infall / accretion of cold gas from the outskirts of the galaxy and/or minor merger / interaction with an small companion recently in the past of the galaxy could explain the main properties of the galaxy . as mentioned above , the tail and the _ cometary morphology _ could be the remnant of these interactions in which an appreciable fraction of gas has been carried away as the result of the tidal torques , then producing the mixing of metals through the ism at large scales . in this sense , the scatter in fig .",

    "clearly , hi observations of tol 65 with high spatial resolution and hst cos observations are needed in order to study the cool gas component and check whether the proposed mechanism are capable to produce the homogeneity of the ism , the difference between the neutral and warm gas metallicity and the morphology of this xmp galaxy .",

    "<S> in this study we present high - resolution visible multi - object spectrograph integral field unit spectroscopy ( vimos - ifu ) of the extremely metal - poor hii / blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxy tol 65 . </S>",
    "<S> the optical appearance of this galaxy shows clearly a cometary morphology with a bright main body and an extended and diffuse stellar tail . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the detection of metallicity gradients or inhomogeneities as expected if the ongoing star - formation activity is sustained by the infall / accretion of metal - poor gas . </S>",
    "<S> no evidences of significant spatial variations of abundances were found within our uncertainties . however , our findings show a slight anticorrelation between gas metallicity and star - formation rate at spaxel scales , in the sense that high star - formation is found in regions of low - metallicity , but the scatter in this relation indicates that the metals are almost fully diluted . </S>",
    "<S> our observations show the presence of extended h@xmath0 emission in the stellar tail of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we estimated that the mass of the ionized gas in the tail m(hii)@xmath11.7@xmath210@xmath3 m@xmath4 corresponds with @xmath524 per cent of the total mass of the ionized gas in the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the h@xmath0 velocity dispersion of the main body and the tail of the galaxy are comparable with the one found in the neutral gas by previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the ionized gas still retains the kinematic memory of its parental cloud and likely a common origin . finally , we suggest that the infall / accretion of cold gas from the outskirts of the galaxy and/or minor merger / interaction may have produced the almost flat abundance gradient and the cometary morphology in tol 65 .    </S>",
