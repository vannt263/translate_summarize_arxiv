    "one of the most important uncertainties associated with the interpretation of high - redshift galaxy observations is our lack of understanding about interstellar extinction .",
    "measurements of galactic star formation rates ( sfrs ) , mass - specific star formation rates ( ssfr ) , age , metallicity , and size all depend in some way on the assumed wavelength dependence and normalization of the dust attenuation law , yet our knowledge of reddening and extinction remains quite limited . from observations of the local universe , it is clear that reddening curves are not universal : while most sight - lines in the milky way ( mw ) have a strong extinction bump near 2175     @xcite , the feature is weaker in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and largely absent in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ; * ? ? ?",
    "this diversity is also reflected by systematic changes in the far ultraviolet ( uv ) , where the wavelength dependence of extinction steepens dramatically as one goes from the milky way to the smc .    further complicating the issue",
    "is the fact that dust within a galaxy is spatially distributed , so simple screen models do not apply to observations of integrated galactic light .",
    "as first reported by @xcite , patchy absorption that is distributed throughout a galaxy can result in an effective attenuation law that has a much weaker wavelength dependence than that measured for stars in the milky way or magellanic clouds .",
    "indeed , by observing 39 nearby starburst systems , @xcite defined an attenuation law between 1200    and 6300     that is much shallower than any screen model , and that has a notable absence of the 2175    bump .",
    "this @xcite law , of course , is an empirical relation which averages over much of the galactic physics that affects the reddening curve .",
    "consider that all young stars spend the first 2 or 3 myr of their lives enshrouded in dusty molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "the dust eventually disperses , so by the time the stars are @xmath2  myr old , they have become dynamically mixed among the older populations . as a result ,",
    "one often models a galaxy s dust attenuation law with two separate components : an optically thin term that is applicable to the older stars , and a dense , optically thick birth cloud that attenuates younger objects . using the dust models of @xcite",
    ", @xcite showed that this age dependency plays a role in defining a galaxy s net attenuation . in systems dominated by young stars embedded in molecular clouds ( i.e. , starburst galaxies ) ,",
    "a shallower uv attenuation curve is found , and no 2175     bump is visible .",
    "conversely , in more `` normal '' star - forming galaxies , where a significant fraction of uv photons are emitted by stars that are no longer in their birth clouds , the wavelength dependence is steeper , and there is evidence for excess extinction at 2175   .",
    "other studies support this model , demonstrating that the 2175    bump is typically visible in `` normal '' star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but not in starburst systems @xcite .    in practice , age and population dependencies",
    "are rarely considered when applying dust attenuation to distant galaxies . instead",
    ", the simple @xcite attenuation law , without a 2175    bump , is most often used to de - redden galactic spectrophotometry in the @xmath3 universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such an application can be justified by the fact that many of these distant systems have star - formation rates similar to today s most extreme starburst galaxies . but how reliable is this curve ?",
    "a number of @xmath4 studies have presented evidence that contradicts the @xcite law @xcite , observing both a 2175    bump and a steeper wavelength dependence in the uv , and @xcite has argued that , while the attenuation curve may agree with @xcite at @xmath5   , it more closely follows an smc extinction curve at longer wavelengths . moreover , the attenuation curve at high redshift may not be universal .",
    "@xcite report that , for bright ( @xmath6 ) , composite - spectrum galaxies with photometric redshifts between @xmath7 , h@xmath8 equivalent widths correlate inversely with the strength of the 2175    bump and the slope of the uv reddening law . similarly , by examining subgroups of 751 galaxies between @xmath9 , @xcite found that the strength of 2175    bump was independent of sfr , but was a weak function of stellar mass and specific star formation rate .    to make further progress on this question ,",
    "large samples of galaxies are needed with well - defined redshifts , comprehensive rest - frame uv through far - ir photometry , intrinsic spectral energy distributions ( seds ) that are reasonably well known , and stellar masses and star formation rates that span a large dynamic range .",
    "such samples now exist in the goods @xcite and cosmos @xcite fields , thanks to a combination of _ hst _ infrared grism spectroscopy @xcite , _ hst _ high - resolution imaging , and a large database of broad- and intermediate - band photometry @xcite . using these data ,",
    "it is possible to investigate the redshift dependence of dust attenuation and emission in a self - consistent manner , taking into account variations in the underlying stellar population and information regarding galactic orientation @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , such an analysis comes at a cost : to compute these properties and derive realistic uncertainties , one needs to consider a large number of parameters . here , we take a more limited approach , and , following the strategy taken by @xcite , consider only the effects of dust attenuation in a subset of @xmath10 galaxies with intense star formation .",
    "specifically , by selecting galaxies with strong emission lines , we limit our analysis to objects whose intrinsic rest - frame uv seds are only weakly sensitive to the details of the stellar population @xcite .",
    "moreover , by including only sources with at least two emission features , we ensure that the redshift assigned to each object is unambiguous .    in this paper",
    ", we derive the mean empirical reddening curve for a sample of @xmath11 galaxies selected via the luminosity of their rest - frame optical emission lines and quantify how the properties of this curve change as a function of stellar mass .",
    "this will lay the groundwork for a more in depth analysis which will self - consistently examine the reddening curves of individual @xmath10 systems @xcite . in  [ sec : sample ] , we define our sample , briefly describe our modeling of the galaxies spectral energy distributions , and outline the procedures used to measure the objects stellar masses and star formation rates . in this section",

    "tens of thousands of spectra are observable on these images , but of special interest to us are those produced by galaxies in the redshift range @xmath0 , where the emission lines of [ o  ii ] @xmath20 , h@xmath21 , and the distinctively - shaped [ o  iii ] blended doublet @xmath22 are simultaneously present in the bandpass . for these objects ,",

    "deep x - ray stacks from the surveys of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite confirm that the vast majority of these objects are normal galaxies with little evidence of nuclear activity @xcite , and any source projected within @xmath26 of a cataloged x - ray position has been excluded from our analysis .",
    "our parent sample is derived from the 256 galaxies analyzed by @xcite , with a subset of 17 galaxies excluded due to their poor or inconsistent photometry ( caused mostly by the effects of close neighbor comtamination ) .",
    "this dataset of f140w @xmath27ab is well characterized , and has already been used for a number of studies , including the analysis of the epoch s star formation rate indicators @xcite , ly@xmath8 escape fraction @xcite , [ ne  iii ] emission @xcite , and stellar mass - metallicity - star - formation rate relation @xcite . to obtain the spectral energy distributions of these galaxies",
    ", we employed the sextractor - based photometric catalog of @xcite , which combines deep , co - added f125w + f140w + f160w images from _ hst _ with the results of 30 distinct ground- and space - based imaging programs .",
    "the result is a homogeneous , psf - matched set of broad- and intermediate - band flux densities covering the wavelength range @xmath28 m to @xmath29 m over the entire region surveyed by the _",
    "hst _ grism . in the cosmos field",

    "subaru , and a host of smaller ground - based telescopes . in goods -",
    "n , the data sources are _ hst , spitzer , _ keck , subaru , and the mayall telescope , and include 22 different bandpasses , while in goods - s , six different telescopes , including _ hst , spitzer , _ the vlt , and subaru , provide flux densities in 40 bandpasses .",
    "the stellar masses of the 239 galaxies in our sample were taken from @xcite , who used the markov chain monte carlo code galmc @xcite to model the galaxies spectral energy distributions . in brief , the @xcite photometry was fit to the 2007 version of the population synthesis models of @xcite , using a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) over the range @xmath30 , and a prescription for nebular continuum and emission lines given by @xcite , as updated by @xcite . since stellar abundances are poorly constrained by broadband sed measurements , the metallicity of our models was fixed at @xmath31 , which is close to the median gas - phase metallicity of our sample @xcite . to avoid the emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , all data points redward of rest - frame @xmath32 m",
    "were excluded from the fits @xcite .",
    "similarly , we removed any data with a central wavelength blueward of 1250   , where the contribution from ly@xmath8 emission is uncertain , and statistical corrections for lyman - line absorptions @xcite may not always be appropriate . finally , for simplicity , the sfr of each galaxy was treated as constant with time , and the attenuating effects of dust were modeled using the prescription of @xcite . although these latter two assumptions may not hold in detail , neither strongly affects our estimates for stellar masses @xcite .",
    "the values for the galactic star formation rates are given in @xcite , who applied the sfr calibrations given by @xcite to measurements of both the objects rest - frame continuum flux density and total monochromatic h@xmath21 emission .",
    "these data demonstrate that at @xmath10 , h@xmath21-based star formation rates are systematically larger than those derived from the uv continuum by a factor of @xmath33 , and that the discrepancy can not be due to the effects of attenuation .",
    "@xcite concluded that the most likely reason for the offset was metallicity , as metal - poor stars have lower opacities , hotter effective temperatures , and more flux beyond the ionization edge of hydrogen ( 13.6  ev ) than metal - rich stars .",
    "the result is a higher rate of photo - ionization in the surrounding ism and stronger balmer recombination lines .",
    "consequently , even though uv flux measurements integrate star formation over a longer timescale than does balmer emission , its use is likely to yield a more reliable estimate of sfr than h@xmath21 , which is usually weakly detected and susceptible to the effects of underlying balmer absorption .    of course , to derive uv - based sfrs , @xcite had to adopt some estimate of internal extinction .",
    "they assumed that the intrinsic rest - frame uv continua of the galaxies is well - represented by a power law , @xmath34 , with @xmath35 .",
    "any flux distribution flatter than this was attributed to internal reddening , with @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "@xcite remarked that while their best - fit relationships between the uv and h@xmath21 extinctions were consistent with the @xcite law , other formulations with different slopes and intercepts were still possible .",
    "for the purpose of understanding the effective ages of our systems only , we use the @xcite uv sfrs in our analysis .",
    "if we were to transform these values into h@xmath21-based sfrs or apply a different extinction law , the conclusions of this paper would remain unaffected , as the range of ages used in our sed modeling analysis is quite conservative ( see   [ sec : intsed ] ) .",
    "the left - hand panel of figure  [ fig : ms ] shows that the stellar masses of our wfc3 ir - grism selected galaxies extend over a full three orders of magnitude , with @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "similarly , the derived sfrs of our systems span a wide range , with @xmath38  yr@xmath39  yr@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this spread provides leverage for our subsequent analysis of the systematic trends in internal reddening .",
    "the galaxies selected via our _ hst _ wfc3 ir - grism observations share a common characteristic : if photo - ionization from hot stars is responsible for the emission seen from h@xmath21 , [ o  iii ] , and [ o  ii ] , then the galaxies must have experienced a period of vigorous star formation within the last 10 myr @xcite . of course , the emission lines do not reveal how long star formation has been occurring nor how the rate of star formation has changed with time .",
    "we can , however , obtain a first order estimate of the star formation timescale by comparing a galaxy s stellar mass to its current rate of star formation . under the assumption of a constant sfr ,",
    "the inverse of the quantity of mass - specific sfr ( ssfr ) is simply the system s age .",
    "as shown in the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : ms ] , these effective ages range from @xmath40 to @xmath41  myr , with the sample average around 100 myr , which is also consistent with the ages derived from the stellar mass fits in   [ sec : masssfr ] . both stellar population models , which assume that stars form stochastically in clusters @xcite , and high - resolution hydrodynamical cosmological simulations @xcite predict that the scatter in the rate of star formation ( for sfr @xmath42  yr@xmath16 ) , smoothed over bins of @xmath43 years , is typically less than a factor of three , and , for the @xmath10 epoch , is more - or - less constant over @xmath44 years . thus , for the sfrs under consideration ( 1 to @xmath45  yr @xmath16 ) , the assumption that star formation has been proceeding at a constant rate for between 10 and 500  myr is reasonable .    of course",
    ", alternative star formation histories are certainly viable .",
    "for example , in their study of 302 galaxies in the redshift range @xmath46 , @xcite found that the best way to reconcile the star formation rates derived from sed modeling with those computed from uv@xmath47mid - ir flux observations is through an exponentially rising star formation rate .",
    "however , such details have very little effect on our analysis .",
    "for example , if we fit the observed seds to models with an exponentially rising star formation rate for a maximally old stellar population ( at @xmath48 , this corresponds to an age of @xmath493 gyr ) , then the best - fitting e - folding time is @xmath50  myr , and the resulting uv sed ( between @xmath51",
    " ) is within 1% of that of a constant sfr model . in other words , though our choice of star - formation rate history can change the age of the oldest stars in our @xmath10 galaxies , it has essentially no effect on our sed - based analysis of extinction .    for consistency with our calculation of stellar mass",
    ", we modeled the galactic seds using the 2007 version of the population synthesis models of @xcite , with the assumptions of a metal abundance of @xmath52 @xcite , and a @xcite imf .",
    "nebular continuum emission , which can be an important contributor to the broadband sed of young , low - mass galaxies @xcite , was modeled following the prescription of @xcite with updated templates from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* private communication ) .",
    "nebular line emission was informed by our grism spectroscopy and subtracted from the photometric data as described in ",
    "[ sec : photometry ] .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig : stellarsed ] presents the results of these runs ( arbitrarily normalized at 1500   ) for three ages : 10  myr , 100  myr , and 500  myr .",
    "the most important feature is the similarity of the spectral slopes in the uv . as a system ages , the strength of the balmer break changes , as does the ratio of uv to optical light .",
    "however , as quantified by @xcite , there is little change in the shape of the stellar continuum between 1250 and 3000   ; on average , the fractional difference between a 10 and 500  myr is just 8% .",
    "this provides a baseline from which to examine the effects of attenuation in galaxies of different masses and star formation rates .",
    "our sample of 239 star - bursting galaxies is distributed between @xmath0 . consequently , in the rest frame , the @xcite photometry of the cosmos , goods - n , and goods - s regions sample each sed differently .",
    "our first task was therefore to resample each galaxy s sed onto a standard grid in rest - frame wavelength .    to create this information , we began by removing [ o  ii ] @xmath20 , h@xmath21 and [ o  iii ] @xmath22 nebular emission from the @xcite photometry using the line flux measurements of @xcite .",
    "we also removed h@xmath8 emission assuming a constant ratio of h@xmath53[o  iii ] @xmath54 0.8 , which is the expected value for the median metallicity and extinction of our sample , and excludef all photometric data with a central wavelength blueward of 1250   , where the contribution from ly@xmath8 emission is uncertain .",
    "we then defined 10 artificial rectangular rest - frame filters of intermediate bandwidth , spaced to encapsulate an equal number of contributing observed frame filters between 1250    and 3500   .",
    "the central wavelengths and widths of these filters are listed in table  [ tab : fake filters ] , along with those of three additional bandpasses that sample the sed redward of the balmer break and roughly covered the observer s frame h - band , k - band , and the combination of [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5]@xmath55 m filters , respectively .",
    "we then computed the galaxies stellar flux densities in these artificial bandpasses by interpolating the actual @xcite photometry onto this new wavelength grid .",
    "specifically , we calculated the fractional throughput of a de - redshifted @xcite filter that overlapped our artificial rest - frame filter and used that as a weight , along with the inverse variance associated with the measurement of flux density . for a galaxy observed with a set of @xmath56 filters ,",
    "the weighted flux in the @xmath57 artificial filter is then @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the observed flux density for the @xmath60 de - redshifted observed filter , @xmath61 is the variance of the flux density for the observed filter , and @xmath62 is the fraction of the @xmath60 de - redshifted observed filter that overlaps the @xmath57 artificial rest - frame filter .    in general ,",
    "the rest - frame uv of our _ hst _ grism - selected galaxies is extremely well sampled by the @xcite photometry , with over two dozen photometric bandpasses in cosmos and goods - s and 12 different filters in goods - n .",
    "consequently , by coarsely sampling the uv with only 10 artificial filters , we are , in effect , smoothing our seds as we place each galaxy on a uniform system .",
    "note , however , that our resampling algorithm is quite generic , and since many of the @xcite bandpasses overlap , we could have chosen to resample the observations onto a much denser wavelength grid , i.e. , to `` drizzle '' the data to a higher spectral resolution @xcite .",
    "however , since high frequency features are not expected to be present in the dust attenuation law , we chose to improve the signal - to - noise of each data point by keeping our wavelength grid relatively coarse . to check this ,",
    "we repeated our analysis with several different bin sizes ranging from 50    to 500   ; in all cases , the results of our analysis were unaffected by the choice of bandpass .",
    "in most studies of the seds of high - redshift galaxies , one simultaneously fits for a galaxy s stellar population and internal galactic reddening by making a priori assumptions about the shape of the dust attenuation curve . in our case ,",
    "the mean spectral energy distribution for our vigorously star - forming systems is well enough constrained so that no assumptions about the behavior of uv dust attenuation are needed , except that its wavelength dependence is the same for every galaxy . in other words , at each point in the wavelength grid ,",
    "the observed flux of a galaxy , @xmath63 , is related to its intrinsic ( de - reddened ) flux , @xmath64 , by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the wavelength dependence of the attenuation normalized at 1500   , @xmath67 is the optical depth of the extinction at 1500   , @xmath68 is the intrinsic shape of the spectral energy distribution , again normalized at 1500   , and @xmath69 is the galaxy s total intrinsic flux density at this normalization wavelength .",
    "as illustrated by figure  [ fig : stellarsed ] , the uv portion of @xmath68 should be similar for every galaxy in our sample .",
    "thus , equation  ( [ eq : attenuation ] ) represents a network of 3107 separate equations : ( one for every photometric measurement of every galaxy ) with 491 unknowns ( each galaxy s value of @xmath69 and @xmath67 , plus the 13-point measurements of the extinction curve , @xmath66 ) .",
    "( actually , for a few galaxies , some photometric data are missing , so the true total number of equations is only 3009 . ) the problem is therefore highly over - constrained and can be solved via non - linear least squares minimization using a levenberg - marquardt algorithm ( such as the matlab program solve ) .    for the assumed shape of the intrinsic sed",
    ", we adopted our 2007 version of the @xcite model for a system that has been forming stars at a constant rate for 100  myr .",
    "this is the mean age implied by the mass - specific star formation rates shown in figure  [ fig : ms ] , and is therefore appropriate for the bulk of the galaxies of our sample . to examine the possible systematic uncertainty associated with this assumption",
    ", we also considered two extreme models : one for a much younger system , where star formation began only 10  myr years ago , and one where steady star formation has been ongoing for 500  myr .",
    "these two seds should bracket the age range of our data and provide an upper limit to whatever systematic error is associated with our analysis .",
    "figure  [ fig : dustall ] presents the results of our least squares fit to the 100  myr constant sfr model . from the figure ,",
    "it is clear that our curve agrees remarkably well with that derived by @xcite from a sample of 135 spectroscopically - confirmed lyman - break galaxies in the redshift range @xmath70 . in general , the masses of the @xcite objects ( @xmath71 ) are greater than those of our emission - line selected galaxies , yet the only significant difference between the two extinction relations is at 2175   , where the higher - mass systems exhibit a small extinction bump .",
    "both curves also agree reasonably well with the @xcite prescription for local starburst galaxies ( as does the uv portion of the reddening curve derived by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although our derived @xmath10 curve has a shallower uv slope .    following @xcite , we can quantify the shape of our attenuation curve via a perturbation on the @xcite law . under this formalism , which was first explored by @xcite ,",
    "our mean attenuation curve is defined by two parameters , one reflecting the slope of the reddening relation ( @xmath72 ) , and the other measuring the amplitude of the 2175    extinction bump ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "specifically , @xmath74 where @xmath75 represents the wavelength dependence of the @xcite law , @xmath76 is the curve s overall normalization , and @xmath77 is a lorentzian - like `` drude '' profile for the extinction bump @xmath78 with @xmath79    and @xmath80     @xcite . by definition , the wavelength dependence derived by @xcite for local starburst galaxies has @xmath81 . for our best - fit curve in figure  [ fig : dustall ] , @xmath82 , and there is no hint of a 2175    bump ( @xmath83 ) . for reference , the screen - model extinction law produced by milky way dust has @xmath84 .",
    "by fitting the individual seds of 751 galaxies between @xmath9 , @xcite found that the dispersion in the best - fit values of @xmath72 and @xmath73 was much larger than could be explained by photometric errors and outliers .",
    "moreover , subsets of their data occupied different regions of the @xmath72-@xmath73 phase space , suggesting that galaxies with different physical parameters possess different attenuation curves .",
    "this result was confirmed by @xcite , who reported that the strength of a galaxy s 2175    bump and the slope of its uv reddening law are both inversely correlated with the equivalent width of its h@xmath8 emission line .    as with most samples of low- and high - redshift galaxies , the physical properties of our ir - grism selected objects ( i.e. , stellar mass , sfr , metallicity , emission - line equivalent widths , size , total extinction , etc . )  are strongly correlated ( or inversely correlated ) with each other @xcite .",
    "consequently , by investigating the systematics of dust attenuation against any one of these variables , we are , in fact , examining its behavior against an entire suite of parameters . since stellar mass has been found to be the primary predictor of many galactic properties , both at high- and low - redshift ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we adopt it as the independent parameter in our study .    to investigate the dependence of the dust attenuation law on stellar mass , we sub - divided our sample of 239 galaxies into three bins spaced roughly equally in log mass .",
    "we then measured each group s reddening law and perturbation parameters ( @xmath73 and @xmath72 ) in exactly the same fashion as in  [ sec : dustlaw ] .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ tab : massbins ] and displayed in figure  [ fig : dustbin ] .",
    "the data clearly indicate a systematic shift in the dust attenuation curves for different mass galaxies .",
    "a gradient is apparent in the slopes of the three attenuation curves , with the higher mass objects having a steeper curve in the uv .",
    "none of the stellar mass bins show evidence of a 2175    bump .",
    "figure  [ fig : dustcompare ] quantifies the systematic behavior of the attenuation curve by plotting the best - fit values of @xmath73 and @xmath72 ( and their uncertainties ) against stellar mass .",
    "also shown are the results from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , along with the milky way and magellanic cloud laws .",
    "the figure demonstrates that the behavior of these perturbation parameters are qualitatively consistent with the trends found from the composite spectral analysis of @xcite .",
    "moreover , although the @xcite law is superficially similar to our attenuation curve , in every case its far - uv slope is ruled out with greater than @xmath86 confidence .",
    "this result is true even for the highest mass objects , where the reddening law lies closest to that seen in local starburst systems .",
    "we can generalize these results by fitting a line through the data and solving for the dependence of @xmath72 and @xmath73 on stellar mass .",

    "mass estimates based on a @xcite initial mass function may be systematically larger by @xmath91  dex , while solar metallicity populations may be larger by @xmath92 .",

    "a larger systematic concern is that associated with the assumed intrinsic stellar population , which is set by both the stellar population synthesis ( sps ) model and the chosen age of the system . in ",

    "figure  [ fig : spsall ] shows the results of this test . in the near - uv",
    ", the slope of the sed is altered due to nebular continuum emission , which is included or added to all of the sps codes , except for one run with cb07 .",
    "nebular continuum emission is clearly most important in the youngest populations , but its effect on the near - uv slope is present in systems of all ages . in the optical and near - ir , the importance of agb stars increases with age , and the various treatments of this component are responsible for the dramatic differences seen at 500  myr . near @xmath94 m , the differences between the cb07 and sb99 500  myr models are just as large as those between the sb99 seds of 10 and 500  myr .    despite these uncertainties , even in the most extreme case , where we use 500  myr models for the most massive galaxies , and allow the least massive systems to be 10  myr old , the uv attenuation curves differ with more than @xmath95 confidence . the same results would be obtained if we were to assume solar metallicity for the highest mass galaxies and use a @xmath96 model for the lowest mass systems .",
    "the effective attenuation law for a @xmath10 emission - line galaxy is clearly a function of its stellar mass , with the higher - mass objects having steeper uv slopes .",
    "only if the star formation history and dust attenuation law are varied in unison would the strength of the correlation diminish .",
    "this possibility will be investigated in more detail in @xcite .",
    "in the sections above , we presented our analysis of galactic attenuation versus stellar mass , and gave the variations of @xmath73 and @xmath72 against this parameter .",
    "comparisons to other physical parameters yield similar results .",
    "when we repeat the experiment using sfr , ssfr , and half - light radius , we see the same trends : the shape of the dust attenuation curve goes from a nearly a @xcite relation for the lowest ssfr , highest sfr , and largest galaxies to a shallower curve in the uv for the highest ssfrs , lowest sfrs , and smallest systems . from the data ,",
    "it is unclear which of these physical parameters is most correlated with the trends in the attenuation curve . nonetheless , the existence of the correlations is quite compelling .",
    "the mass dependency of our empirically - derived attenuation curves is consistent with the age - dependent star - to - dust geometries modeled by @xcite . as the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : ms ] illustrates , lower mass systems in our sample",
    "have systematically younger ages as defined by the stellar mass to sfr ratio .",
    "therefore , these lower mass galaxies should have more of their uv light enshrouded in an optically thick dust cloud .",
    "this situation should produce a shallower attenuation curve @xcite , which is exactly what is observed .",
    "on the other hand , our low - mass systems also have low metallicities @xcite and possibly more intense interstellar radiation fields ( isrf ) due to their higher ssfrs .",
    "the dust carrier of the 2175    bump may be easily destroyed in such an environment , or perhaps the lack of metals changes the dust composition , which then affects the wavelength dependence of opacity . in the sings @xcite survey , @xcite found that the mid - ir emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons drops dramatically for galactic metallicities below @xmath97 .",
    "since the origin of the 2175    bump has been suggested to be carbonaceous in nature , perhaps the two parameters are linked @xcite . we do not offer a physical model for the dust composition as a function of metallicity or isrf ; we only state that we can not exclude it as the explanation for our observed correlation between the steepness of the dust attenuation curve and stellar mass .",
    "disentangling the effects of ism geometry from dust composition is an extremely difficult undertaking @xcite .",
    "ideally , one would require high - spatial resolution imaging to observe both the stars and individual h  ii regions and directly determine the star - dust geometry .",
    "unfortunately , at @xmath10 , this would require @xmath40  pc , or @xmath98 resolution , which is well beyond current technology . at the same time",
    ", one would also like to probe the chemistry of both the gas and the dust via their emission features .",
    "again , this task is exceedingly difficult , as it requires deep optical , near - ir , and mid - ir spectrophotometry .",
    "although the optical and near - ir observations are theoretically possible using instruments like mosfire @xcite , it is time - prohibitive for the lowest mass objects in our sample .",
    "nevertheless , the applicability of our results is far - reaching .",
    "emission - line selected galaxies , such as those analyzed here , are poised to quickly become the dominant population of known @xmath4 objects .",
    "extremely large , wide - field cosmological surveys such as hetdex ( hobby eberly telescope dark energy experiment ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and euclid @xcite will construct samples of millions of emission - line galaxies , via the detection of ly@xmath8 , h@xmath8 , [ o  ii ] , and [ o  iii ] . in order to exploit these data for galaxy evolution studies , one will need to understand the relation between objects intrinsic and observed seds .",
