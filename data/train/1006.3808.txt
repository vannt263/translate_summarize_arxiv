    "general relativity and quantum mechanics are not yet unified in a coherent theory as we do not have yet a fully successful theory of quantum gravity . but",
    "this does not mean that we lack any kind of quantum gravitational predictions : at least at low energy , quantum gravity can be described by an effective field theory based on metric degrees of freedom , as was first shown by donoghue and others @xcite .    at scales",
    "much smaller than the characteristic scale , which is here the planck mass , effective field theory predictions are possible and calculable .",
    "examples of this kind are the calculation of the first quantum corrections to the gravitational interaction potential between two masses @xcite , and the low - energy graviton scattering cross - section @xcite .",
    "the important point about these predictions is that no matter which theory actually describes high - energy quantum gravity - a string theory , a spin foam model , or other approaches - in the infrared ( ir ) limit any physically valid theory must reproduce the results found in the effective field theory framework .    in the last years",
    ", the hypothesis that the high energy completion of quantum gravity can still be described using the metric as fundamental degrees of freedom has gained some new support .",
    "in particular the possibility that there exists a non - trivial ultraviolet ( uv ) fixed point of the renormalization group ( rg ) flow , with a finite dimensional uv critical surface , has been investigated within what is called the `` asymptotic safety '' scenario @xcite .",
    "progress in this direction has been possible thanks to the development of a powerful functional rg framework based on the construction of a scale dependent effective action , called effective average action @xcite . for a general discussion of the relation of this approach to perturbative theory ,",
    "see @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show how the low energy effective field theory predictions naturally arise in the effective average action approach to quantum gravity . in this way",
    "we start to delineate a picture able to describe gravitational phenomena at all scales : from the uv physics of the non - trivial fixed point down to the ir physics of the low energy effective action .",
    "the basic technical tool at our disposal is the exact rg flow equation that the effective average action satisfy @xcite .",
    "the solution of this integro - differential equation poses challenging technical difficulties . as of",
    "now there are no completely adequate techniques able to fully extract all the non - perturbative information which is in principle contained in the rg flow of the effective average action . in this work",
    "we will focus on a truncation ansatz where we consider an expansion of the effective average action in powers of the curvature and where the scale dependence is encoded in the rg running of ( possibly nonlocal ) form factors . in this way we project the flow from the full theory space onto a subspace which is still infinite dimensional : the functional space of the running form factors .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that to recover sensible results in the ir limit this is the minimal type of truncation ansatz we have to consider .",
    "also , we will consider only the one - loop flow , driven by the einstein - hilbert operator @xmath2 , of the effective average action , where progress can be made with the aid of the non - local heat kernel expansion @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we shortly review the construction of the effective average action for quantum gravity , we introduce the truncation ansatz we will consider , and we show how the one - loop flow equations in @xmath3-dimensions are obtained using the non - local heat kernel expansion exposed in appendix a. in section 3 we integrate the flow equations for the form factors in @xmath4 from the ultraviolet ( uv ) scale to the infrared ( ir ) scale recovering in this limit the effective field theory results . in section 4 we discuss how the quantum corrections to the newtonian potential arise in our approach .",
    "finally , section 5 contains our concluding remarks . in",
    "the appendices we give an overview of the non - local heat kernel expansion and include some details of the calculations .",
    "the effective average action is a coarse - grained effective action depending on the ir cutoff scale @xmath5 .",
    "it interpolates smoothly between the bare action in the uv , for @xmath6 is the uv scale , not to be confused with the running cosmological constant @xmath7 . ] , and the full effective action in the ir , for @xmath8 @xcite . in the gravitational context",
    "it is constructed using the background field formalism @xcite , and is a functional @xmath9 $ ] depending on the average metric fluctuation @xmath10 , on the average ghost fields @xmath11 and on the background metric @xmath12 .",
    "the full quantum field is recovered in the sum @xmath13 .",
    "the background metric is used to implement in a gauge invariant way the coarse - graining procedure . a cutoff operator constructed with the background metric - generally , a laplacian type operator - is used to divide the slow field modes from the fast field modes , which are then integrated out .",

    "applying it gives us that for large @xmath143 we have : @xmath145 joining this with the asymptotic expansion for the result we obtained for @xmath137 , we conclude that the quantum correction for the newtonian potential of a point source of mass @xmath146 is given at long distances @xmath147 by @xmath148\\,.\\ ] ] the full newtonian potential of the point source would therefore be given asymptotically by : @xmath149\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    one might find this asymptotic result peculiar in several respects : the leading order correction is dominant over the eft ones ( @xmath150 versus @xmath151 ) , and the subleading terms are oscillatory , which is difficult to interpret physically .",
    "we suggest that this is due to the large @xmath143 expansion being unphysical for the problem under consideration .",
    "recall that the equations of motion derived from the effective action predict the expectation values of quantities such as the metric . from the effective average action , which is defined by a path integral with an infrared cutoff at scale @xmath5",
    ", we would expect to obtain , if @xmath5 is treated as fixed , equations of motion for `` approximate expectation values '' , that do not include the information about low frequency field modes .",
    "these might be a good approximation in the @xmath152 regime ( where @xmath153 is the radial coordinate for us , or more in general the greatest physical length scale involved in the problem ) but we would expect the results to be incorrect for @xmath154 . if this reasoning is accepted , the result in ( [ phiasympt ] ) is not physical , since it is obtained as a large @xmath153 expansion for fixed @xmath5 ; the physical quantum correction to the potential is to be obtained instead from the @xmath155 limit at fixed @xmath153 .    taking the limit @xmath155 in ( [ fourier ] ) in @xmath139 gives zero up to a purely local term involving @xmath156 . in @xmath137 ,",
    "this results in a similar local term plus @xmath157 .",
    "this latter term implies a nontrivial long - distance correction for the newtonian potential @xmath158\\ ] ] ( because @xmath123 , obtained by integrating the flow ( [ betas ] ) , is @xmath159 and thus vanishes at @xmath88 ) .",
    "this is the same result obtained in effective quantum gravity for the contribution of the graviton and ghost vacuum polarization diagrams to @xmath160 @xcite .",
    "since we have treated the matter source in a purely classical way , we are not obtaining the terms due to vertex corrections is also found in effective quantum gravity , with an arbitrary constant involving the renormalization scale @xmath97 . ] .",
    "this confirms that the effective field theory quantum corrections to newton s law are indeed recovered in the right limit from the effective average action .",
    "our remarks above imply a general philosophy of interpreting the effective average action as a useful device to follow the flow of the renormalization group ( and hopefully discover a uv fixed point ) but not as an action from which physics can be directly extracted by solving equations of motion : these , predicting expectation values of observables , should be computed from the @xmath88 usual effective action . on the other hand ,",
    "there have been several attempts @xcite to extract physics from the effective average action itself by identifying @xmath5 with an inverse distance scale of the spacetime under consideration , instead of as a fixed parameter . for a static and spherically symmetric situation like the one we are considering ( with just a point source ) this proposal means @xmath161 with @xmath162 a numerical constant .",
    "( note that above we argued that the effective average action with cutoff @xmath5 is to be trusted only for @xmath163 , whereas this approach conjectures that it can be trusted only for @xmath164 . ) .",
    "if we do this replacement before computing @xmath137 and @xmath139 , we see that in the case of a point source the variable @xmath73 is just @xmath165 , and so",
    "all the functions of it are numerical constants",
    ". the newtonian potential would therefore be @xmath166\\ ] ] with @xmath167 a numerical constant ( the @xmath123 term gives a similar contribution , as has often been noted ) .",
    "this agrees with the general form of the effective field theory correction discussed above .",
    "however , this agreement in form is rather trivial , following just from dimensional analysis and the lack of other length scales in the problem once we make the conjectured identification for @xmath5 .",
    "a more interesting test of the conjectured identification is in the case of an extended source with spherical symmetry , such as a spherical star . here",
    "a naive application of this conjecture that equates @xmath5 with the inverse distance to the center of the star , at the level of ( [ fourier ] ) , leads to @xmath168 which is obtained from ( [ fourier ] ) by making the replacement @xmath161 , changing variables from @xmath138 to @xmath169 , and defining @xmath170 as the result of the @xmath171-integrals @xmath172 with @xmath173 taken out .",
    "on the other hand , the result obtained from effective theory ( and from our formulas as @xmath155 ) is @xmath174 these two formulas agree asymptotically for large @xmath153 ( up to a factor related to @xmath162 ) , but will in general be different at closer distances where results depend on new length scales implicit in the function @xmath175 for the density within the star ( see @xcite for a discussion of how ( [ star ] ) depends on this ) .",
    "it is not surprising that the direct identification @xmath161 fails , even in spherically symmetric spacetimes , when there is more than one length scale of interest .",
    "@xmath5 is a momentum scale , and matching it with a spacetime scale , as its inverse , should be possible unambiguously when there is only one spacetime scale to be used ( such as @xmath153 for a point source ) .",
    "but when there are more length scales involved , such as the radius of a star or other parameters relevant to its internal structure , there is no a priori reason to expect the simple matching of @xmath5 with inverse radial distance to be correct .",
    "it is noteworthy that the qualitative agreement with effective field theory for a general source could be obtained if ( instead of @xmath176 ) we identified @xmath5 with @xmath177 before integrating over @xmath178 , in effect defining a @xmath179 as the inverse distance to each point source @xmath178 instead of the inverse distance to the global center of symmetry of the spacetime .",
    "the plausible reason why this works is because for each point source the direct identification with inverse radial distance is valid , and within our weak field approximation linear superposition of sources is valid ; we make no claim as to its validity in a more general situation , a matter which deserves further research .",
    "the alternative position that we are suggesting is that the equations of motion derived from the effective average action are to be trusted only in a small @xmath5 regime , and ultimately are only correct when @xmath155 and we recover the usual effective action .",
    "the effective average action and its renormalization flow are promising research avenues for developing a theory of quantum gravity . in this paper we have sought to accomplish two related goals . the first one is to take the first steps towards investigating the flow of non - local terms in the action .",
    "we have been able to compute and exhibit the solution for the non - local form factors in the second - order term in a general curvature expansion for the action , within the one - loop approximation where the flow is generated only by the operator @xmath2 equations ( [ 20.1 ] ) and ( [ 20.2 ] ) summarize this result .",
    "it would obviously be desirable to go beyond our approximations .",
    "one - loop computations of the flow of higher order non - local terms seems possible in principle by extension of the methods of this paper , though computationally very intensive . on the other hand , going beyond the one - loop approximation and obtaining information about the non - perturbative flow is a difficult and open research question .",
    "a first step towards it would be to improve the running of the form factors ( [ 14 ] ) by computing the beta function not from the bare action but from an action with running @xmath51 and @xmath7 , which can be found from the beta functions ( [ betas ] ) .",
    "another question is how our results generalize to @xmath3 dimensions ; so far , the only similar case that has been investigated is the @xmath180 computation for the polyakov action in @xcite .",
    "local truncations in extra dimensions were explored in @xcite .",
    "our second goal has been to clarify the relationship between the effective average action formalism and the usual perturbative effective field theory .",
    "these goals are related in that the one - loop effective action for quantum gravity is non - local .",
    "we have shown how this action is recovered in the @xmath155 limit of our flow , and how the long - distance quantum corrections it induces on the newtonian potential are also recovered in the same limit .",
    "we have also exhibited a computation of the quantum correction from the @xmath5-dependent average action , and we have argued that it can not be trusted except in the @xmath155 limit , and in particular not in the @xmath154 regime . it has been shown in passing that the often - suggested prescription of identifying @xmath5 with the inverse radial distance does not recover effective theory results in general , beyond the simplest case of a point source . however , more sophisticated relationships of @xmath5 with inverse distance scales ( such as the one considered in the last paragraph of the previous section ) are not ruled out and require further research .",
    "our results might also be of interest in applications of the effective average action to cosmology , where similar identifications of @xmath5 with inverse time scales have been suggested @xcite .",
    "a central question faced by the effective average action formalism is how to extract physical predictions from the flow . in our opinion ,",
    "our results lend credence to the position that the relevant physics is to be extracted from the full effective action at @xmath155 .",
    "@xmath181 would then be considered a useful device for studying the flow of the theory and unveiling a uv fixed point , but not to compute observables , which should in principle be computed ( at all scales ) from the effective action @xmath182 .",
    "this is to be taken only as a tentative position , and more work is needed on the foundational conceptual issues of the effective average action approach to settle these questions definitely .",
    "our problem is to compute functional traces of the form @xmath183 $ ] where @xmath184 for gravitons and for ghosts is given in the two terms of ( [ 3 ] ) and @xmath185 for each is given in ( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "following standard practice , e.g. @xcite , we use @xmath186 , the heat kernel of the operator @xmath185 : @xmath187=\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\mathrm{d}s\\,\\mathrm{tr}[k(s)]\\tilde{w}(s)\\ ] ] where @xmath188 is the laplace anti - transform of @xmath184 .",
    "a general expression for the trace of the heat kernel of operators of the form ( [ 7 ] ) , in the form of a curvature expansion with non - local form factors , is obtained in @xcite . using a notation",

    "we have @xmath192 for the graviton case , and @xmath193 in the ghost case .",
    "the functions @xmath194 take the form :    @xmath195\\,,\\\\ \\phi_{3}(x ) & = \\frac{1}{12}f(x)+\\frac{f(x)-1}{x}\\,,\\\\ \\phi_{4}(x ) & = \\frac{1}{2}f(x)\\,,\\\\ \\phi_{5}(x ) & = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{f(x)-1}{x}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath65 is defined above in ( [ fdef ] ) . to obtain our claimed result ( [ 8 ] ) ,",
    "all we need to do is reexpress the five second - order terms in ( [ kernel ] ) in terms of the basis @xmath196 , @xmath197 .",
    "this is done by expressing @xmath191 in terms of @xmath198 as defined above , expressing @xmath199 in terms of @xmath198 , @xmath131 and @xmath200 by using the definition ( [ 4 ] ) for the @xmath185 operators , and eliminating @xmath198 in terms of @xmath131 and @xmath200 by means of the identity @xmath201 proven in @xcite .",
    "note that to the order we are working we can freely commute covariant derivates as well as functions of them , throwing away terms of higher order in the curvature arising from commutators . doing the described operations for the graviton part and the ghost part of the trace and combining them we obtain result ( [ 8 ] ) .",
