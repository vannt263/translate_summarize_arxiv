    "we began by removing data within 500 s of a flare , which is defined to be when the flux is more than 75% above the mean level for the light segment .",
    "a preliminary pulse template was then created by manually aligning a selected set of epoch 2 light segments with clearly defined pulses .",
    "the alignment was accomplished by fitting a combination of sine functions to the selected light segments , and adjusting the phases accordingly .",
    "manual alignment of the pulses is preferable to folding the entire light curve because it corrects for variations in the arrival times due to the source s position in the orbit .",
    "all light segments were folded modulo 912.0 s ( bodaghee et al .",
    "2006 ) , and then the epoch 2 and 3 light segments were cross correlated with the preliminary pulse template .",
    "the cross correlation lag times were measured to the nearest second .",
    "the resultant pulse arrival times were then used to create a more refined pulse template including all epoch 2 and 3 data ( minus the flares ) .",

    "the dotted lines represent the phase corresponding to the pulse arrival times ( table 2 ) .",
    "the error bars are 1@xmath3 statistical uncertainties.[pprofile],width=316 ]      statistical errors on the pulse arrival times were calculated using monte carlo simulations . for each light segment ,",
    "one hundred trial light curves were created .",
    "each point on the light curve was chosen randomly from a gaussian distribution centered on the measured number of counts , and with the standard deviation determined by poisson counting statistics from source and background errors added in quadrature .",
    "each trial light curve was cross correlated with the template , yielding slightly different pulse arrival times .",
    "the quoted statistical uncertainty is the standard deviation of the difference in pulse arrival time relative to what was measured from each light segment .",
    "statistical errors usually ranged from 3 to 10 s , though the noisier light curves lead to errors of 15 to 30 s , and a few were much larger .",
    "in addition to statistical errors , systematic uncertainties in the pulse arrival times can be caused by distortions in the average pulse profile .",
    "these distortions can be caused by varying flux , contamination from nearby sources ( e.g. , 4u 1630 - 47 ) , and the energy dependence of the pulse shape can be affected by varying levels of local absorption . to estimate these errors , we aligned each folded light segment with the pulse template using the measured pulse arrival times , and each aligned and folded light segment was then used as a trial pulse template for all of the other folded light segments .",
    "the resultant arrival times from each trial generally created a gaussian distribution centered on the measured arrival time , though occasionally there were outliers .",
    "figure [ syserrhist ] shows a histogram of the difference in the measured pulse minima versus the final template , created by using all light segments as trial templates for all other light segments , for a total of 1770 total elements .",
    "a gaussian was fitted to the histogram to find a systematic standard deviation of 5.76 s , and this error was added in quadrature to each statistical error .",
    "although the statistical and systematic errors may be correlated , whereby addition in quadrature would overestimate the total errors , the histogram has statistically significant deviations from the normal distribution at a pulse minima difference of 2030 s , suggesting that the errors associated with some of the pulse arrival times are underestimated in this scenario . moreover , if the pulse period is different from 912.0 s , folding each light segment on this period will result in slight smearing of the pulsations and will lead to additional systematic errors of order a few seconds .",
    "s. [ syserrhist],width=288 ]      motivated by the possibility of orbital modulation of spectral parameters , we extracted one spectrum from each epoch 2 and 3 observation .",
    "the epoch 1 spectra were not analyzed due to contamination from 4u 1630 - 47 .",
    "the igr j16393 - 4643  spectrum consists of emission from the pulsar , plus diffuse emission from the galactic ridge due to the 1@xmath15 field - of - view of the pca .",
    "the pulsar emission was modeled with an absorbed power - law with a high energy cut - off plus a gaussian to model iron line emission .",
    "the galactic ridge emission was modeled using the valinia & marshall ( 1998 ) parameterization , consisting of an absorbed raymond - smith plasma component of temperature @xmath423 kev and a power - law component of photon index @xmath41.8 .",
    "the galactic ridge components were fixed at the valinia & marshall ( 1998 ) best - fit values , but we included a variable overall multiplicative constant to adjust the normalization .",
    "the fourteen spectra were fitted simultaneously using xspec v11.3.2 .",
    "unfortunately , we found it difficult to constrain the spectral parameters , and especially the hydrogen column density , due to the galactic ridge emission . from 35 ( 38 ) kev , the ridge emission accounts for about 75% ( 60% ) of the total flux measured by the pca .",
    "this explains the 21 @xmath0 1% pulse fraction measured by the pca , versus the 38 @xmath0 5% measured by _ xmm - newton _ from 210 kev , and 54 @xmath0 24% by _ integral _ from 1540 kev : the ridge emission effectively washes out the signal .",
    "any uncertainty in the ridge emission normalization leads to even larger uncertainties in the inferred column densities . more importantly , since pulsar spectra are typically complex functions of both phase and energy ( white et al .",
    "1983 ) , changes in the igr j16393 - 4643  spectrum with pulse phase confuse the analysis .   a final source of confusion in the spectral analysis results from brief flaring episodes , which last for @xmath4100 - 500 s. interestingly , the strongest flares usually occurred at the pulse phase corresponding to the maximum of the pulse profile ( @xmath17 , see fig .",

    "the spectrum during the flare was best fit with a photon index @xmath19 , while @xmath20 for the rest of the observation .",
    "this type of spectral hardening is not unexpected , yet it precludes constraining the hydrogen column density and power - law components simultaneously due to correlations between these parameters . we leave a full phase resolved spectral analysis as future work .",

    "determination of the orbital elements is complicated by the need to decouple the effects of the orbital doppler delays and the intrinsic changes in the neutron star rotation rate . to minimize these concerns , we first searched for circular orbital solutions using the epoch 2 data only .",
    "the pulse arrival times were fitted to equation ( 1 ) , using a fine grid of initial values for the pulse period , projected semi - major axis , orbital period , and phase .",

    "if confirmed , solution 3 would represent an extremely important discovery because the orbital companion would more likely be an intermediate mass black hole ( imbh ) rather than a normal star . since the pulsar is observable in x - rays",

    "it is heavily absorbed , with roughly an order of magnitude more absorption than can be attributed to the galactic interstellar medium ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) , indicating intrinsic absorption within the binary system .",
    "such strong absorption is probably due to the stellar wind of a young companion star .",

    "nevertheless , it s position on the plot of pulse period versus orbital period  the so - called corbet diagram ( corbet 1984)implies that the companion is a supergiant with an underfilled roche lobe rather than a be star .",
    "the absence of transient behavior and the probable circular orbit further suggest that this is a supergiant system and not a be x - ray binary . until recently",

    "<S> with recent and archival _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) x - ray measurements of the heavily obscured x - ray pulsar igr j16393 - 4643 , we carried out a pulse timing analysis to determine the orbital parameters . assuming a circular orbit , we phase - connected data spanning over 1.5 years . </S>",
    "<S> the most likely orbital solution has a projected semi - major axis of 43 @xmath0 2 lt - s and an orbital period of 3.6875 @xmath0 0.0006 days . </S>",
    "<S> this implies a mass function of 6.5 @xmath0 1.1 m@xmath1 and confirms that this _ integral _ source is a high mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) system . by including eccentricity in the orbital model </S>",
    "<S> , we find @xmath2 at the 2@xmath3 level . </S>",
    "<S> the 3.7 day orbital period and the previously known @xmath4910 s pulse period place the system in the region of the corbet diagram populated by supergiant wind accretors , and the low eccentricity is also consistent with this type of system . </S>",
    "<S> finally , it should be noted that although the 3.7 day solution is the most likely one , we can not completely rule out two other solutions with orbital periods of 50.2 and 8.1 days . </S>"
