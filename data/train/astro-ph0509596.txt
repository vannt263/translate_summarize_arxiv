    "the process of tidal capture of a body into a bound orbit through the excitation of oscillatory internal modes is thought to be of general importance in astrophysics .",
    "it is likely to play a role in binary formation in globular clusters ( eg .",
    "press & teukolsky , 1977 , hereafter pt and references therein ) as well as in tidal interactions of stars within galactic centres . when there are repeated close encounters as for a highly eccentric orbit",
    ", circularisation may result , a process of potential importance for extrasolar planets ( eg .",
    "ivanov & papaloizou 2004 , hereafter ip ) .",
    "until now , only the oscillation modes associated with spherical non rotating stars have been considered with possibly rotation being treated as a perturbation ( eg .",
    "pt , ip ) . but",
    "angular momentum is transfered in tidal encounters and when , as is often the case , the internal inertia is much less than that of the orbit , the tidally excited object would be expected to rotate at a balanced rate or undergo pseudo synchronisation .",
    "then the rotation frequency is matched to the most important ones in a fourier decomposition of the tidal forcing .",
    "it is then natural to expect that inertial modes controlled by the rotation ( see eg .",
    "papaloizou & pringle 1981 , hereafter pp ) become important for the tidal response .",
    "this is especially the case for a barotropic configuration has the same functional dependence on the density @xmath2 : @xmath3 , for the unperturbed configuration and during perturbation . ] , with no stratification and hence no low frequency @xmath4 modes .",
    "we would expect inertial modes , which have periods that scale with the rotation frequency , to be particularly important for large periastron distances as the fundamental spherical modes suffer increasing frequency mismatch as this distance increases .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to calculate the response of a rotating body taking the inertial modes into account .",
    "in particular we focus on modes with @xmath0 which dominate the angular momentum exchange and a full polytrope with index @xmath5 we show that the inertial modes indeed dominate the response at larger periastron distances of interest in many cases .    in section 2 we give the basic equations governing the linear response of a uniformly rotating barotropic star to the tidal forcing due to a close encounter . in section 3",
    "we give a self - adjoint representation of the linear problem and discuss how it can be used to provide a formal solution in terms of a spectral decomposition as can be done for a non rotating star . in section 4",
    "we develop expressions for the energy and angular momentum exchange . in section 5",
    "we give results for a polytrope with index @xmath6 , showing that the @xmath0 inertial wave response is contained within just a few global modes and that inertial modes dominate the tidal response for large periastron passages .",
    "accordingly these must be considered when discussing tidal circularisation from large eccentricity for objects such as extrasolar planets .",
    "we assume that the star is rotating with uniform angular velocity @xmath7 directed perpendicular to the orbital plane . in this case",
    "the hydrodynamic equations for the perturbed quantities take the simplest form in the rotating frame . for a convective star , approximated as barotropic",
    ", we have @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the lagrangian displacement vector , and @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the density , @xmath12 is the density perturbation , @xmath13 is the adiabatic sound speed , @xmath14 is the stellar gravitational potential arising from the perturbations and @xmath15 is the external forcing tidal potential .",
    "note that the centrifugal term is absent in equation @xmath16 being formally incorporated into the potential governing the static equilibrium of the unperturbed star .",
    "the convective derivative @xmath17 as there is no unperturbed motion in the rotating frame .",
    "the linearised continuity and poisson equations are @xmath18    we use a cylindrical coordinate system @xmath19 with origin at the centre of the star and assume that the tidal potential and the resulting perturbation to some quantity , say @xmath20 , is represented in terms of a fourier transform over the angle @xmath21 and time @xmath22 .",
    "thus @xmath23 , where the sum is over @xmath24 and @xmath25 and @xmath26 denotes the complex conjugate .",
    "the reality of @xmath20 implies that the fourier transform , indicated by tilde satisfies @xmath27    to solve the forcing problem we obtain equations for the fourier transforms of the perturbations using @xmath28 we can then express @xmath29 in terms of @xmath30 with help of @xmath16 , the density perturbation in terms of @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath30 with help of ( [ eq 2 ] ) , and substitute the results into the continuity equation ( [ eq 3 ] ) to get @xmath33 where @xmath34 , and @xmath35 @xmath36 it is very important to note that the operators @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are self - adjoint when the inner product @xmath40 with @xmath41 denoting the volume of the star . also when @xmath42 is not a constant @xmath43 and @xmath38 are positive definite and @xmath39 is non negative definite .",
    "equations ( [ eq 2 ] ) , ( [ eq 4 ] ) and the poisson equation ( [ eq 3 ] ) form a complete set .    when @xmath44 equation ( [ eq 4 ] ) describes the free oscillations of a rotating star .",
    "these may be classified as relatively high frequency @xmath45 and @xmath46 modes and inertial modes with eigen frequencies @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath45 and @xmath46 modes exist in non rotating stars and can be treated in a framework of perturbation theory ( eg . ip ) . here",
    "we focus on the response of inertial waves to tidal forcing , for slow rotation .",
    "we seek a solution as a series expansion in the small parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 , with @xmath51 and @xmath52 being the mass and the radius of the star , respectively .",
    "the small parameters will be assumed to be of the same order .    to zeroth order ( when @xmath53 ) the tidal potential induces a quasi - static bulge in which tidal forces are balanced by pressure and self gravity and @xmath54 with @xmath55 . from equation ( [ eq 4 ] )",
    "we conclude that @xmath42 is smaller than the potential perturbations by a factor of order @xmath56 ( see pp for details ) .",
    "accordingly , setting @xmath57 in equation ( [ eq 2 ] ) and using equation ( [ eq 3 ] ) we obtain @xmath58 in the lowest order approximation we find @xmath30 using equation ( [ eq 4 ] ) neglecting the higher order term proportional to @xmath59 on the right hand side .",
    "we thus have @xmath60 where the source term @xmath61 is completely determined by the external forcing via equation ( [ eq 8 ] ) .",
    "finally , the perturbation of the internal gravitational potential associated with @xmath30 , @xmath62 follows from ( [ eq 2 ] ) , ( [ eq 3 ] ) and ( [ eq 8 ] ) @xmath63",
    "equation ( [ eq 9 ] ) is of a general type that governs the linear response of rotating bodies in a context that is much wider than the specific one considered here ( see lynden bell & ostriker 1967 ) .",
    "one recurring difficulty has been that the way in which the frequency @xmath64 occurs does not readily allow application of the general spectral theory of self - adjoint operators to the response calculation even though @xmath43 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are themselves self - adjoint ( eg .",
    "dyson & schutz 1979 ) .",
    "we here provide a formulation in which the problem can be dealt with in the same way as a standard self - adjoint one such as occurs for a non rotating star .",
    "we begin by remarking that the self - adjoint and non negative character of @xmath43 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 allows the spectral theorem to be used to specify their square roots , eg .",
    "@xmath65 , defined by condition @xmath66 .",
    "the positiveness of @xmath43 allows definition of the inverse of @xmath65 , @xmath67 .",
    "technically , this is done through using the spectral decomposition @xmath68 .. etc .",
    ", where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the eigenfunctions and the eigenvalues of the corresponding operators and the last equation defines a general function of the operator @xmath43 . the sum may formally include integration with an appropriate measure in the case of a continuous spectrum of the corresponding operators .",
    "now let us consider a generalised two dimensional vector @xmath71 with components such that @xmath72 and the straightforward generalisation of the inner product given by equation ( [ eq 7 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that equation ( [ eq 9 ] ) can be derived from the matrix form @xmath73 where @xmath74 and the source vector @xmath75 has the components @xmath76 it then follows from ( [ eq 12 ] ) that we may choose @xmath77 since the off diagonal elements in the matrix ( [ eq 13 ] ) are adjoint of each other and the diagonal elements are self adjoint , that the operator @xmath78 is self - adjoint is manifest .",
    "now we can use the spectral theory of self - adjoint operators to look for a solution to ( [ eq 9 ] ) in the form @xmath79 , where @xmath80 are the real eigenfunctions of @xmath78 which satisfy @xmath81 the associated necessarily real eigen frequencies being @xmath82    substituting ( [ eq 14 ] ) into ( [ eq 12 ] ) we obtain @xmath83 where , following the landau prescription , we have added an infinitesimal imaginary part @xmath84 to the frequency @xmath85 the inner product induced by @xmath78 turns out to be @xmath86 , where @xmath87 . using ( [ eq 10 ] ) and ( [ eq 15 ] )",
    "we explicitly obtain @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the norm .",
    "the time derivative @xmath90 of the wave energy @xmath91 associated with the rotating frame and the time derivative @xmath92 of the wave angular momentum @xmath93 are given by usual expressions @xmath94 the wave energy associated with the inertial frame , @xmath95 is given in terms of @xmath91 and @xmath93 ( eg .",
    "friedman @xmath96 schutz 1978 , hereafter fs ) through @xmath97    expressing @xmath98 with help of ( [ eq 2 ] ) in terms of @xmath42 and discarding the total derivatives which can not contribute to the total energy transfer @xmath99 , we obtain @xmath100 contributions @xmath101 to @xmath102 arising from different values of @xmath103 may be calculated separately .",
    "substituting the corresponding fourier transforms into ( [ eq 19 ] ) , and integrating over time , we obtain @xmath104 where @xmath105 . note that for the problem on hand @xmath106 and @xmath107 are real ( see below ) .",
    "now we substitute the spectral decomposition @xmath108 , where @xmath109 , together with ( [ eq 16 ] ) into ( [ eq 20 ] ) .",
    "the singularities in the integral over @xmath64 corresponding to @xmath110 and determining all non - zero contributions to the integral are dealt with using the landau prescription .",
    "then the energy transfer is a sum of contributions associated with each mode , being given by @xmath111 where @xmath112 , and both integrals are evaluated for @xmath110 .    using the symmetry properties of the operator @xmath113",
    "one can readily see that the integrals are , in fact , the negatives of each other , thus we finally obtain @xmath114 where @xmath115 .",
    "the expression for the angular momentum transfer follows immediately from ( [ eq 23 ] ) and the general relation between wave energy and angular momentum corresponding to a mode with particular value of @xmath103 : @xmath116 ( eg .",
    "we have @xmath117 and @xmath118    the expressions ( [ eq 23 ] ) , ( [ eq 24 ] ) can be evaluated when the star is in a parabolic orbit , being the limit of a highly eccentric orbit , using the expression for @xmath119 given in the quadrupole approximation by pt . from this",
    "we obtain @xmath120 where @xmath121 , @xmath122 .",
    "@xmath123 is the ratio of @xmath51 to the mass of the star exerting the tides , @xmath124 : @xmath125 .",
    "@xmath126 is a typical frequency of periastron passage and @xmath127 is the periastron distance .",
    "the functions @xmath128 specify the dependence of @xmath31 on @xmath64 , they are described by pt .",
    "y=@xmath129 , where we use dimensionless frequencies @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "@xmath132 is the associated legendre function , and @xmath133 are the spherical coordinates .",
    "now we express the density perturbation entering in ( [ eq 23 ] ) , ( [ eq 24 ] ) as @xmath134 here we introduce a factor @xmath135 to account for self - gravity of the star that can be obtained from the solution of ( [ eq 8 ] ) in the frequently used   cowling approximation . ]  .",
    "we substitute this expression and ( [ eq 25 ] ) in ( [ eq 23 ] ) , ( [ eq 24 ] ) and express all quantities in natural units .",
    "these are such that the spatial coordinates , density and sound speed are expressed in units of @xmath52 , the averaged density @xmath136 , and @xmath137 , respectively .",
    "we then have @xmath138 @xmath139 where @xmath140 , @xmath141 , and @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "the overlap integrals @xmath145 have the form : @xmath146 where @xmath147 .",
    "the eigen frequencies @xmath148 and the integrals @xmath145 in equations ( [ eq 26]-[eq 27 ] ) have to be calculated numerically , for a given model of the star",
    ". therefore , equation ( [ eq 14 ] ) describing free oscillations of the star must be solved . for our numerical work we model the star as @xmath6 polytrope and use the method of solution of ( [ eq 14 ] ) proposed by pp .",
    "our results are in a good agreement with results obtained by lockitch @xmath96 friedman ( 1999 ) and dintrans @xmath96 ouyed ( 2001 ) who used different methods . ]",
    "namely , we reduce ( [ eq 14 ] ) to an ordinary matrix equation using an appropriate set of trial functions , and solve the corresponding eigenvalue problem . the details of our approach will be given in a separate publication .",
    "here we note that we use different numbers @xmath149 of the trial functions to study convergence of our numerical scheme with the largest number being equal to @xmath150 .",
    "also we adopt a spherical model of the star assuming that the distortion of the stellar structure due to rotation does not influence significantly our results .",
    "since the modes corresponding to @xmath0 fully determine the transfer of angular momentum in the quadrupole approximation and apparently dominate the energy transfer , which can only be increased if @xmath24 modes are included , we consider only them .    [ theor3 ]    the absolute values of the eigen frequencies @xmath151 are always smaller than or equal to @xmath152 .",
    "for complete polytropes it is expected that they ultimately yield an everywhere dense discrete spectrum ( pp ) . in our numerical approach",
    "their number is equal to @xmath153 , and therefore the number of the terms in the series in ( [ eq 26 ] ) and ( [ eq 27 ] ) depends on @xmath149 .",
    "however , only the eigenfunctions with some definite values of @xmath151 give a significant contribution to the series .",
    "these terms correspond to global eigen modes with a large scale distribution of @xmath154 over the star .",
    "therefore , the overlap integrals corresponding to the global modes are not averaged to small values after integration over the volume of the star .",
    "the number of the global modes does not depend on @xmath149 . in figure 1",
    "we show the overlap integrals as functions of the eigen frequencies .",
    "there is a sharp rise of @xmath145 near @xmath155 and very close to @xmath156 , and several peaks corresponding to different values of @xmath151 .",
    "the rise at @xmath157 , @xmath25 is due to numerical inaccuracy of our method , but the corresponding modes practically do not influence our results and therefore the numerical inaccuracy is not significant for our purposes . note that the feature at @xmath157 can be removed by an appropriate regularisation of @xmath39 .",
    "three peaks with @xmath158 and @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 correspond to the global modes .",
    "the spatial distribution of the corresponding eigenfunctions is shown in figure 2 .",
    "for comparison we also show a non global mode with @xmath164 and a very small value of @xmath165 .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the global modes have a large scale distribution of @xmath154 .",
    "it follows from ( [ eq 26 ] ) and ( [ eq 27 ] ) that for a given model of the star , the quantities @xmath166 depend only on @xmath167 . in figure 3",
    "we show the dependence of @xmath168 ( the solid black curve ) and @xmath169 ( the solid red curve ) on @xmath170 .",
    "the solid green curve shows the dependence of the energy transfer in the inertial frame , @xmath171 .",
    "note that the energy transfer in the inertial frame is negative when @xmath172 .",
    "the dotted curves show the dependencies of the corresponding quantities calculated with only two global modes , the retrograde mode with @xmath158 and the prograde mode with @xmath160 .",
    "figure 3 shows that the dotted and the solid curves are very close to each other .",
    "therefore , only two modes are essential for our problem .",
    "the angular momentum transfer is equal to zero when @xmath173 , where @xmath174 .",
    "the condition @xmath175 may be easily realised in an astrophysical situation where the inertial modes dominate the tidal response and the moment of inertia of the star is sufficiently small . in this case",
    "the system quickly relaxes to the so - called state of pseudo synchronisation where @xmath175 . in figure 4",
    "we show the dependence of @xmath176 on @xmath177 for this case .",
    "the black curve shows the contribution of the inertial waves , @xmath178 the red curve shows the contribution of the @xmath45 mode to the energy transfer calculated for a non - rotating star ( pt ) and the green curve shows the same quantity but calculated when @xmath179 ( ip ) .. this has no influence on the conclusions of the paper . ]",
    "it is clear from this figure that when @xmath180 the inertial waves dominate the tidal response . for a planet with jupiter mass and radius circularising from large eccentricity to attain a final period of @xmath181 days , @xmath182 ( ip ) , such that inertial modes dominate by a wide margin .",
    "in this paper we formulate a new self - adjoint approach to the problem of oscillations of uniformly rotating fully convective star and apply this approach to the tidal excitation of the inertial waves and tidal capture .",
    "the approach can be used in any other problem where oscillations with typical frequencies of the order of the angular velocity are important .",
    "it can also be extended to the case of convectively stable stars .",
    "the oscillations with higher frequencies can also be treated in framework of an extension of our formalism .",
    "we show that the tidal response due to inertial waves can be represented as a spectral decomposition over normal modes .",
    "this formalism is general enough to be applied even when the spectrum is not regular and discrete . for full polytropes , only a few global modes with a large scale distribution of the perturbed quantities over the star contribute significantly to the response .",
    "we find general expressions for the energy and angular momentum transfer between the orbit and inertial waves .",
    "it is shown that when the inertial waves dominate the tidal response and a state of pseudo synchronisation is reached the energy transfer is determined by simple equation ( [ eq 29 ] ) . as follows from that equation the energy transfer does not decrease exponentially with the orbital periastron and therefore at large periastra the energy transfer due to inertial waves dominates over the energy transfer due to excitation of the fundamental mode .",
    "this can be very important for the problem of tidal circularisation of the extra solar planets ( see above , ip and references therein ) , and can be of interest for other problems , such as eg .",
    "the problem of tidal capture of convective stars in globular clusters .",
    "the application of our approach to extra solar planets will be discussed in a separate publication .",
