    "galaxy mass is thought to be a fundamental quantity which governs the evolution of galaxies .",
    "detailed observations of present - day galaxies show that various properties of galaxies such as star formation rate ( sfr ) and gas phase metallicity correlate with mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "theoretically , galaxy formation models based on @xmath13cdm cosmology predict that galaxies grow through subsequent mergings of lower - mass objects and that galaxy properties are largely determined by their masses through mass - dependent processes at work in the evolution of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , observations of the mass - dependence of galaxy properties back in cosmic time are crucial to understanding how galaxies evolve to acquire present - day properties .",
    "past observations have revealed that some physical quantities like sfr and metallicity correlate with mass also at high-@xmath14 , although the correlation seems to evolve with redshift relative to the local galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "they demonstrated the importance of mass - dependent effects on galaxy evolution .",
    "however , high-@xmath14 samples are biased for high - mass galaxies ( @xmath15 ) because most of them are based on continuum selected samples , such as lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ; e.g. , @xcite ) and bzk galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "furthermore , low - mass galaxies at high redshifts such as laes are especially interesting since they are likely to be building blocks of massive galaxies seen in later epochs .",
    "thanks to the remarkable progress in observations of laes , our knowledge of their properties is rapidly accumulating ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , in almost all the observations , physical properties of laes including sfr and metallicity have been generally estimated by the sed fitting of broadband photometry .",
    "this is in contrast to massive galaxies at similar redshifts . while a large number of massive , continuum - selected galaxies have now direct measurements of sfr and metallicity from nebular lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) , there are only a few laes with such direct measurements @xcite .",
    "one of the major reasons for the paucity of the direct measurements is that well - studied laes are located at very high redshift ( @xmath17 ) , where ( rest - frame optical ) nebular lines redshift into infrared wavelengths that can not be observed from the ground .",
    "however , nebular lines of bright laes at moderate redshifts ( @xmath18 ) have now been measured through recent lae surveys ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is known that sfrs derived from sed fitting are dependent on the star formation history assumed , and they can vary by an order of magnitude among different histories ( e.g. , @xcite ) . it is also known that sed fitting can not strongly constrain metallicities due to the degeneracy with age ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "observations of nebular lines for a large number of laes are essential to extending star formation rate and metallicity measurements toward low - mass galaxies below @xmath19 , so that the mass - dependencies of sfr and metallicity can be compared with their present - day homologue over a full mass range .",
    "we are conducting an imaging survey of @xmath20 laes in several fields on the sky using three narrow - band filters described below .",
    "this redshift is unique because [ oii]@xmath21 and h@xmath0lines fall into wavelength ranges where oh - airglow is very weak , thus enabling one to study sfrs and metallicities of laes using these lines from the ground .",
    "we developed a new narrow - band filter , nb387 , with a central wavelength and fwhm of @xmath22  and @xmath23 , respectively , to select laes over @xmath24 ",
    ". [ oii ]  and h@xmath0  lines in this redshift range are then observed through near - infrared ( nir ) narrow - band filters , nb118 ( @xmath26 , fwhm@xmath27 ) and nb209 ( @xmath28 , fwhm@xmath29 ) , respectively , developed by the newh@xmath0 survey ( lee et al . in preparation ) . in this paper",
    ", we present the results from data of the subaru/_xmm - newton _  deep survey field , which are the first results of this triple - narrowband survey .",
    "while our nb118 and nb209 imaging in the sxds is not deep enough to detect [ oii ]  and h@xmath0  lines for individual objects except for very luminous ones , we successfully detect these emission lines in the stacked images of more than @xmath30 laes .",
    "we then measure their fluxes to derive the sfr and metallicity , and place the constraints on the average sfr and metallicity of a typical lae at @xmath2 for the first time .",
    "we use these measurements to discuss the sfr and metallicity of low - mass ( @xmath31 ) galaxies at @xmath8 .",
    "since ly@xmath0 photons produced in a galaxy are expected to be easily absorbed by dust in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the galaxy during repeated resonant scatterings by neutral hydrogen gas , a puzzle is why laes have such strong ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "there are three possible answers to the puzzle .",
    "the first is that laes are primordial galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if population iii stars are formed following a top - heavy initial mass function , hard uv photons would be radiated in a short time scale , and strong ly@xmath0 lines would be observed . in this case , laes are young , and extremely metal poor galaxies .",
    "this will be tested by the metallicity we estimate .",
    "the second is that the ism has a clumpy geometry ( e.g. , @xcite ) , where the ly@xmath0 photons are scattered at the surfaces of the clumps and thus are not heavily absorbed before escaping from the galaxy .",
    "the third is the outflow of the ism ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "ly@xmath0 photons that are scattered at the far side of expanding ism can be doppler shifted to have redder wavelengths , and escape from galaxies without being heavily absorbed by neutral hydrogen gas . in order to investigate these possibilities , we estimate the ly@xmath0 escape fraction , @xmath32 , for our laes by comparing the observed ly@xmath0 luminosity with the intrinsic ly@xmath0 luminosity predicted from the dust - corrected h@xmath0  luminosity .    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the data in  [ sec : data ] .",
    "the sample of @xmath2 laes is constructed in  [ sec : selection ] , where the results of optical spectroscopy are also shown . in  [ sec : detections ] , we detect [ oii ]  and h@xmath0  emission in the stacked laes and calculate their equivalent widths .",

    "in fact the assumption on the shape of the passband used to derive equation ( [ eq : ew_0th ] ) is over simplified in two aspects : the actual nb118 and nb209 passbands are not top - hat but rather close to a triangle shape and the central wavelengths of these passbands vary over the fov ( equation ( [ eq : nir_nb_shift ] ) ; see  [ ssec : nir_nb ] ) .",

    "the simulations are carried out under the assumption that all @xmath152 objects have identical spectra , i.e. , the same ew and the same underlying continuum spectra .",
    "for the continuum spectra , we use the best - fit spectrum from the sed fitting to the stacked lae ( see  [ sec : sed_fitting ] ) with constant star formation history @xcite and the best - fit spectrum from the sed fitting to the @xmath235 stacked lae @xcite , and find that the results are consistent with each other well within their @xmath61 errors . ] .",

    "indeed , @xcite find that @xmath403 lbgs with @xmath567 have @xmath32  of just a few percents . as described in  [ sec : introduction ] , however , there is a possibility that dust does not always attenuate ly@xmath0 emission , but rather plays an important role in escaping ly@xmath0 photons from galaxies . in order to quantify the effect of dust on @xmath32",
    ", we introduce the parameter @xmath501 following @xcite , which is defined as @xmath568 , where @xmath569 and @xmath570 are defined as @xmath571 and @xmath572 with @xmath573 being the extinction coefficient at @xmath574 .",
    "small values ( @xmath575 ) mean that ly@xmath0 photons suffer less attenuation by dust than uv - continuum photons , as expected for a clumpy distribution of the ism ( e.g. , @xcite ) or special kinematics of the ism ( e.g. , outflows ; @xcite ) , while large values ( @xmath576 ) means that ly@xmath0 photons are more heavily attenuated by dust .",
    "the @xmath501 parameter is expressed in terms of @xmath32  and @xmath404 as : @xmath577 using @xmath578 @xcite we obtain @xmath579 .",
    "similar results have been obtained from other studies .",
    "for example , @xcite obtained @xmath580 for @xmath2 laes , and @xcite found a median of @xmath581 for their @xmath582 lae sample .",
    "we note again that the @xmath404 value of our stacked object estimated by sed fitting may suffer additional errors due to possible systematic uncertainties ( see  [ sec : sed_fitting ] ) , so may the @xmath501-value .",
    "however , even when we take an extreme case of @xmath583 , @xmath501 increases only up to @xmath584 , implying that very large @xmath501 ( @xmath585 ) are unlikely .",
    "our result thus favors models of laes ism being outflowing , or possessing a multi - phase clumpy distribution , or both , rather than in a homogeneous , static distribution .",
    "we also apply equation ( [ eq : lya_f_esc ] ) to the individually detected objects , nb387-c-22326 , nb387-w-04041 , and nb387-w-04492 to obtain @xmath32@xmath586 , @xmath587 , and @xmath588% , respectively .",
    "these values are derived from dust uncorrected h@xmath0  luminosities , and hence are upper limits .",
    "figure [ fig : lya_f_esc ] shows @xmath32  against the observed ly@xmath0 luminosity for our laes ( the red circle for the stacked object and the cyan circles for the individually detected objects ) together with those laes taken from the literature for which h@xmath0  emission is individually detected : six laes at @xmath112 whose h@xmath0  luminosities are estimated from narrowband imaging @xcite and two laes with h@xmath0  spectra at @xmath406 and @xmath545 @xcite . it is found that most of the laes with individual h@xmath0  detection have @xmath32@xmath589% , with objects brighter in ly@xmath0 luminosity tending to have higher escape fractions .",
    "it is interesting that our stacked object is roughly on this trend , since laes with individual h@xmath0  detection should be biased toward higher h@xmath0  luminosities .",
    "it may imply that most laes ( irrespective of h@xmath0  detection ) have relatively high @xmath32 , at least higher than the volumetrically averaged star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "the trend of increasing @xmath32  with ly@xmath0 luminosity seems to be natural because galaxies with higher @xmath32  have brighter ly@xmath0 luminosities and thus are more easily selected as laes .",
    "finally , we note that recent studies have shown that a fraction of ly@xmath0 is emitted from diffuse outer halos of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we estimate the strength of ly@xmath0 from the color @xmath62nb387 with a certain aperture , therefore the escape fraction we derive is only the fraction escaping from the central region of the laes .",
    "we have presented the results of the first detection of [ oii ]  and h@xmath0  emission from a typical ly@xmath0 emitter ( lae ) at @xmath2 using a stacking analysis of a sample constructed from our subaru / suprime - cam narrowband ( nb387 ) survey in the subaru/_xmm - newton _  deep survey field .",
    "the redshift @xmath2 is unique , because [ oii ]  and h@xmath0  lines fall into nir wavelengths where oh - airglow is very weak .",
    "we found @xmath150 lae candidates in this field .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy was made for @xmath154 candidates selected to cover wide ranges of nb387 magnitudes and @xmath62nb387 colors . among the @xmath171 out of @xmath154 candidates with nb@xmath590 ,",
    "@xmath149 were confirmed as @xmath112 laes .",
    "no emission line was detected for the remaining @xmath168 with nb@xmath591 due to the lack of sensitivity .",
    "the near infrared observation was made to detect [ oii ]  and h@xmath0   lines by the newh@xmath0 survey ( lee et al . in preparation ) with kpno / newfirm , using the narrowband filters nb118 and nb209 , respectively ; @xmath152 laes are located in the area covered by nb118 ( nb118 sub - sample ) , among which @xmath153 have also nb209 imaging ( nb209 sub - sample ) .",
    "only seventeen and seven candidates are individually detected in nb118 and nb209 , respectively .",
    "however , a stacking analysis of a large number of undetected laes yielded statistically significant detection in both narrowbands .",
    "we estimated the [ oii ]  and h@xmath183[nii ]  ews and fluxes of the stacked object using monte carlo simulations , and used the estimates to derive the sfr , gas phase metallicity , and ly@xmath0 escape fraction ( @xmath32 ) of a typical lae .",
    "our main results probed by the triple narrow - band survey are summarized as follows .",
    "* the h@xmath0  luminosity of the stacked object , after correction for a contribution from [ nii ]  lines ( estimated to be modest ) to the h@xmath183[nii ]  photometry and for a dust extinction of @xmath398 ( derived from sed fitting ) , is @xmath426ergs@xmath4 , which corresponds to a sfr of @xmath452yr@xmath4 .",
    "this is the first estimate of the sfr of a typical lae at high-@xmath14 based on the h@xmath0  luminosity . adopting an stellar mass of @xmath592 derived from sed fitting",
    ", we plot the stacked object on the specific sfr ( ssfr ) vs. @xmath456 plane , and find that our stacked object is located below a simple extrapolation toward lower - masses of the observed ssfr - @xmath456 relation of @xmath8 bzk and uv - selected galaxies .",
    "this trend is also evident for laes at similar redshifts whose sfrs are inferred by sed fitting .",
    "this indicates that low - mass galaxies with @xmath458 have lower star formation efficiencies than expected from massive galaxies .",
    "* we use the line ratio [ oii]/(h@xmath183[nii ] ) as a metallicity indicator , and find that the metallicity of the stacked object is no less than @xmath514 at the @xmath7 level .",
    "this is the first constraint on the metallicity of a typical lae at high-@xmath14 , and this relatively high lower - limit does not support , at least at @xmath8 , the hypothesis that laes are extremely metal poor ( @xmath9 ) galaxies at the @xmath10 level .",
    "we plot the stacked object on the mass - metallicity ( @xmath537 ) plane , and find that the stacked object is not consistent with a simple extrapolation toward lower masses of the observed @xmath537 relation of @xmath8 uv - selected galaxies .",
    "instead , our result seems to be consistent with the recently proposed fundamental @xmath537 relation @xcite for which the relatively low sfr of the stacked object is taken into account .",
    "* from the ly@xmath0 and h@xmath0  luminosities , we found that the @xmath32  of the stacked object is @xmath593% , and can be as high as @xmath563% , much larger than those inferred for volumetrically averaged star forming galaxies at @xmath2 and lyman - break galaxies at higher-@xmath14 , but comparable to those of laes at @xmath18 .",
    "we compiled the @xmath32  data of laes with h@xmath0  emission from the literature , and found that most laes have relatively high @xmath32(@xmath589% ) , and that there are a mild trend that brighter laes have higher @xmath32 .",
    "we also found a low @xmath501 value for our object , @xmath579 .",
    "all these findings indicate that laes have some unique mechanisms to efficiently emit ly@xmath0 photons .",

    "we sincerely thank the subaru telescope staff for their great helps of our suprime - cam observations .",
