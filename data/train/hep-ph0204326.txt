    "one of the common goals in the forthcoming experiments is the search for new phenomena . in the forthcoming high energy physics experiments ( lhc , tev22 , nlc , ... )",
    "the main goal is the search for physics beyond the standard model ( supersymmetry , @xmath6- , @xmath7-bosons , ... ) and the higgs boson discovery as a final confirmation of the standard model . in estimation of the discovery potential of the planned experiments ( to be specific in this paper we shall use as an example cms experiment at lhc  @xcite ) the background cross section ( the standard model cross section )",
    "is calculated and for the given integrated luminosity @xmath8 the average number of background events is @xmath9 .",
    "suppose the existence of a new physics leads to additional nonzero signal cross section @xmath10 with the same signature as for the background cross section that results in the prediction of the additional average number of signal events @xmath11 for the integrated luminosity @xmath8 .",
    "the total average number of the events is @xmath12 .",
    "so , as a result of new physics existence , we expect an excess of the average number of events . in real experiments",
    "the probability of the realization of @xmath13 events is described by poisson distribution  @xcite    @xmath14    here @xmath15 is the average number of events .",
    "remember that the poisson distribution @xmath16 gives  @xcite the probability of finding exactly @xmath13 events in the given interval of ( e.g. space and time ) when the events occur independently of one another at an average rate of @xmath17 per the given interval .",
    "for the poisson distribution the variance @xmath18 equals to @xmath17 .",
    "so , to estimate the probability of the new physics discovery we have to compare the poisson statistics with @xmath19 and @xmath20 . usually , high energy physicists use the following `` significances '' for testing the possibility to discover new physics in an experiment :    * `` significance '' @xmath21  @xcite , * `` significance '' @xmath22  @xcite , * `` significance '' @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "a conventional claim is that for @xmath24 we shall discover new physics ( here , of course , the systematic uncertainties are ignored ) . for @xmath25",
    "the significances @xmath26 and @xmath27 coincide ( the search for higgs boson through the @xmath28 signature ) . for the case when @xmath29 ,  @xmath26 and @xmath27 differ .",
    "therefore , a natural question arises : what is the correct definition for the significance @xmath26 , @xmath27 or anything else ?",
    "it should be noted that there is a crucial difference between the planned experiment and the real experiment . in the real experiment",
    "the total number of events @xmath30 is a given number ( already has been measured ) and we compare it with @xmath3 when we test the validity of the standard physics .",
    "so , the number of possible signal events is determined as @xmath31 and it is compared with the average number of background events @xmath3 . the fluctuation of the background is @xmath32 , therefore , we come to the @xmath26 significance as the measure of the distinction from the standard physics . in the conditions of the planned experiment when we want to search for new physics , we know only the average number of the background events and the average number of the signal events , so we have to compare the poisson distributions @xmath33 and @xmath34 to determine the probability to find new physics in planned experiment .    in this paper",
    "we describe a method for estimation of the discovery potential and exclusion limits on new physics in planned experiments .",
    "the effective significance of signal for given probability of observation is proposed for planned experiments instead of the usual significances @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the average numbers of signal and background events .",
    "we also estimate the influence of systematic uncertainties related to nonexact knowledge of signal and background cross sections on the probability to discover new physics in planned experiments .",
    "an account of such systematics is very essential in the search for supersymmetry at lhc .",
    "the organization of the paper is the following . in the next section mainly due to completeness we discuss the case of real experiment . in section 3",
    "we describe a method for the estimation of new physics discovery potential in planned experiment .",
    "section 4 deals with estimation of exclusion limit . in section 5",
    "we estimate the influence of the systematics related to nonexact knowledge of the signal and background cross sections on the probability to discover new physics and set up exclusion limits on new physics in planned experiments .",
    "section 6 contains concluding remarks .",
    "in this section well known situation with real experiment is reminded to pedagogical reasons . consider the case when the average number @xmath17 of the events in the poisson distribution ( 1 ) is big @xmath35 . in this case the poisson distribution ( 1 ) approaches the gaussian distribution    @xmath36    with @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "note that for the poisson distribution the mean equals to the variance .",
    "according to common definition @xcite new physics discovery corresponds to the case when the probability that background can imitate signal is less than @xmath41 ( here of course we neglect any possible systematic uncertainties ) .",
    "suppose we have observed some excess of events @xmath42 .",
    "the probability that for the background @xmath3 we shall observe events with @xmath43 is determined by standard formula @xmath44 where @xmath45 according to common definition for @xmath46 the standard model is excluded ( the probability that background can imitate signal is less than @xmath47 ) and we have new physics discovery .",
    "suppose some model with new physics predicts @xmath48 and @xmath49 then for @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) the model with `` new physics '' agrees with experimental data at 90% c.l .",
    "( 95% c.l . ) . here",
    "@xmath52 .    for @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) in formula ( 3 )",
    "the probability that background can imitate signal is less than 2.28% ( 0.14% ) and according to we have weak ( strong ) evidence in favor of new physics .",
    "suppose that the measured number of events is such that @xmath55 it means that the standard model agrees at 95 % c.l . with experimental measurement .",
    "in this case we can also obtain exclusion limit on new physics ( limit on the average number of signal events @xmath2 ) .",
    "namely , for @xmath56 we require that @xmath57 from the equation ( 7 ) we obtain 95% c.l .",
    "upper bound on the average number @xmath2 of signal events .",
    "consider now the case of the poisson distribution ( 1 ) .",
    "suppose we have measured the number of events @xmath58 ( an excess of events ) .",
    "we define the statistical significance @xmath59 of a signal  @xcite in the standard model by    @xmath60    the formula ( 8) is nothing but the probability to observe @xmath61 of background events in an identical independent experiments .",
    "note that @xmath59 is a function on @xmath30 and @xmath3 ,   @xmath62 .",
    "if @xmath63 then by common definition we have new physics discovery . for @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) according to our definition we have weak(strong ) evidence in favor of new physics .",
    "if the model with additional @xmath2 signal events obeys the inequality    @xmath66    then the model with new physics agrees at 95% c.l . with an experiment .",
    "suppose that we have observed the number of events compatible at 95% c.l . with the standard model , i.e.    @xmath67    in this case one can obtain at 95% c.l .",
    "exclusion limit on the average number of signal events @xmath2 from the inequality    @xmath68",
    "as it has been mentioned in the introduction the crucial difference between planned experiment and real experiment is that in real experiment we know the number of observed events , therefore we can compare the standard model with experimental data directly , whereas in the case of planned experiment we know only the average number of background events @xmath3 and the average number of signal events ( for the case when we have new physics in addition to the standard model ) .",
    "therefore in the case of planned experiment an additional `` input '' parameter is the probability of the discovery .",
    "suppose we test two models : the standard model with the average number of events @xmath19 and the model with new physics and the average number of events @xmath69 .    to discover new physics we have to require that the probability @xmath70 of the background fluctuations for @xmath71 is less than @xmath72 , namely @xmath73    the probability @xmath74 that the number of events in a model with new physics will be bigger than @xmath75 is equal to @xmath76    it should be stressed that if @xmath72 is a given number then @xmath77 is a function of @xmath72 or vice versa we can fix the value of @xmath78 in formula ( 13 ) then @xmath72 is a function of @xmath78 .",
    "the meaning of the probability of the discovery @xmath79 is the probability that in the case of new physics an experiment will measure the number of events bigger than @xmath80 such that the probability that the standard model can reproduce such number of events is rather small ( @xmath81 ) .    in other words",
    "we choose the critical value @xmath80 for hypotheses testing ( new physics is present , i.e. @xmath48 ) against a simple alternative hypothesis @xmath82 ( new physics is absent , i.e. @xmath19 )  @xcite .",
    "] about observability of new physics requiring that type ii error @xmath83",
    ". then we calculate the type i error @xmath78 and the probability of discovery ( or evidence ) @xmath79 .    for fixed value of @xmath78 and",
    "known values of @xmath2 , @xmath3 we can calculate @xmath81 using formulae ( 12,13 ) . in our numerical calculations",
    "we take @xmath84 .",
    "consider now the limiting case @xmath85 when poisson distribution approaches gaussian distribution .",
    "the equations ( 12,13 ) take the form    @xmath86    @xmath87    consider at first the most simple case when @xmath88 ( see figs.1 - 2 for an illustration ) .",
    "for @xmath88 parameter @xmath80 in formula ( 15 ) is equal to @xmath89 .",
    "the equation ( 14 ) takes the form    @xmath90    where @xmath91    the significance @xmath26 is determined by the formula ( 17 ) and it is often used in experiment proposals  @xcite .    for @xmath92 ( see fig.3 for an illustration ) the parameter @xmath80 in formula ( 14 ) is equal to @xmath93 where @xmath94 : @xmath95 ; @xmath96 ; @xmath97 ; @xmath98 ( as an example , tab.28.1  @xcite ) .",
    "the effective significance @xmath59 in the equation ( 8) ( i.e. corrected significance @xmath26 , corresponding the discovery probability @xmath99 ) has the form @xmath100    so , we see that the asymptotic formula ( 17 ) for the significance @xmath59 is valid only for @xmath101 .    as it has been shown in refs .",
    "@xcite the more proper of the significance in planned experiments is @xmath102 .",
    "the generalization of this significance to the case of @xmath92 looks very attractive for approximate estimation of discovery potential @xmath103    the comparison of formulae ( 19,20 ) is shown in fig.4 .",
    "it should be stressed that very often in the conditions of planned experiment the average numbers of background and real events are not very big and we have to solve the equations ( 12 , 13 ) directly to construct @xmath104 discovery , @xmath105 strong evidence and @xmath106 weak evidence curves .",
    "our numerical results are presented in figs .",
    "( 5 - 10 ) .    as an example",
    "consider the search for standard higgs boson with a mass @xmath107 using the @xmath108 decay mode at the cms detector .",
    "for total luminosity @xmath109 one can find @xcite that @xmath110 , @xmath111 .",
    "using the formula ( 19 ) and table of the standard normal probability density function  @xcite we find that @xmath112 .",
    "it means that for total luminosity @xmath113 the cms experiment will discover at @xmath114 level standard higgs boson with a mass @xmath115 with a probability 93(60 ) percents .",
    "level the higgs boson will be discovered at 93(60 ) cms detectors ]    for the case when we are interested in estimation of the lower bound on number @xmath2 of signal events ( bound on new physics ) we can use the equations    @xmath116    @xmath117",
    "it is important to know the range in which the planned experiment can exclude the presence of signal at the given confidence level ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "it means that we will have uncertainty in future hypotheses testing about non observation of signal equals to or less than @xmath119 . in refs.@xcite different methods to derive exclusion limits in prospective studies",
    "have been suggested . as is seen from fig.11",
    "the essential differences in values of the exclusion limits take place .",
    "let us compare these methods by the use of the equal probability test  @xcite . in order to estimate the various approaches of the exclusion limit determination",
    "we suppose that new physics exists , i.e. the value @xmath2 equals to one of the exclusion limits from fig.11 and the value @xmath3 equals to the corresponding value of expected background .",
    "then we apply the equal probability test ( @xmath120 ) to find critical value @xmath80 for hypotheses testing in planned measurements ( fig.12 ) . here",
    "a zero hypothesis @xmath121 is the statement that new physics exists and an alternative hypothesis @xmath82 is the statement that new physics is absent . after the calculation of the type i error @xmath78 ( the probability that the number of the observed events will be equal or less than the critical value @xmath80 ) and the type ii error @xmath81 ( the probability that the number of the observed events will bigger than the critical value @xmath80 in the case of the absence of new physics ) we can compare the methods . for this purpose the relative uncertainty  @xcite   @xmath122 which will take place under hypotheses testing @xmath121 versus @xmath82 is calculated .",
    "this relative uncertainty @xmath123 in case of applying the equal - probability test is a minimal relative value of the number of wrong decisions in the future hypotheses testing for poisson distributions .",
    "it is the uncertainty in the observability of the new phenomenon .",
    "note the @xmath124 ( the relative number of correct decisions ) is a distance between two distributions ( the measure of distinguishability of two poisson processes ) in frequentist sense .    in table 1",
    "the result of the comparison is shown . as is seen from this table the `` typical experiment '' approach",
    "@xcite gives too small values of the exclusion limit .",
    "the difference in the 90%  cl definition is the main reason of the difference between our results and the results from ref .",
    "we require that @xmath123 equals to @xmath119 , i.e. we use only one parameter ( @xmath119 ) as measure of uncertainty in the hypotheses testing . in ref",
    "@xcite the criterion @xmath125 and @xmath126 for determination of the exclusion limits has been applied .",
    "it means the experiment will observe with probability at least @xmath127 at most a number of events such that the limit obtained at the @xmath118 confidence level excludes the corresponding signal . in this case",
    "two parameters ( @xmath128 ) are required to construct exclusion limits .",
    "nevertheless , we have got results close to  @xcite   as measure of uncertainty  @xcite gives a somewhat different results . ] .",
    "in the previous sections we took into account only statistical fluctuation in the number of signal and background events and did not take into account other uncertainties . there is considered the systematic uncertainties   and @xmath2  @xcite implies the existence of conditional probability for parameter of poisson distribution .",
    "we consider here forthcoming experiments to search for new physics . in this case",
    "the systematic uncertainties has theoretical origin without any statistical properties . ] due to imperfect knowledge of the background and signal cross sections .    in this section",
    "we investigate the influence of the systematic uncertainties related to nonexact knowledge of the background and signal cross sections on the discovery potential in planned experiments .",
    "denote the born background and signal cross sections as @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "an account of one loop corrections leads to @xmath131 and @xmath132 , where typically @xmath133 and @xmath134 are @xmath135 for the lhc .",
    "two loop corrections for most reactions at present are not known .",
    "so , we can assume that the uncertainty related with nonexact knowledge of cross sections is around @xmath134 and @xmath133 correspondingly .",
    "in other words we assume that exact cross sections lie in the intervals @xmath136 and @xmath137 , where @xmath138 and @xmath10 are calculated at born or one loop level of the accuracy .",
    "the average number of background and signal events lie in the intervals @xmath139 , @xmath140 , where @xmath9 , @xmath11 .    to determine the new physics discovery potential we again have to compare two poisson distributions with and without new physics .",
    "contrary to the section 3 we have to compare the poisson distributions in which the average numbers lie in some intervals .",
    "it means that we have to find the critical value @xmath80 and to estimate the influence of systematic uncertainty on the discovery probability .",
    "a priori the only thing we know is that the average number of background and signal events lie in some intervals but we do not know the exact values of the average background and signal events .",
    "moreover we can not say anything about probability distributions of possible values @xmath3 and @xmath2 in this interval .",
    "such distribution is absent .",
    "an account of uncertainties related to nonexact knowledge of background and signal cross sections is straightforward and it is based on the results of section 3 .",
    "suppose uncertainty in the calculation of exact background cross section is determined by parameter @xmath141 , i.e. the exact cross section lies in the interval @xmath142 and the exact value of average number of background events lies in the interval @xmath143 .",
    "let us suppose @xmath25 .",
    "in this instance the discovery potential most sensitive to the systematic uncertainties .",
    "because we know nothing about possible values of average number of background events , we consider the worst case . taking into account formulae ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) we have the formulae is the maximal one , but we think that both the signal and the background cross sections are minimal ]    @xmath144    @xmath116    this approach allows estimate the scale of influence of background uncertainty to observability of signal . as an application of formulae ( 23,24 ) consider the case @xmath145 ( typical case for the search for supersymmetry at lhc ) . for such values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 and for @xmath141= 0 . , 0.1 , 0.25 , 0.5 we find that @xmath146 = 0.9996 , 0.9924 , 0.8476 , 0.137 , correspondingly .",
    "so , we see that the uncertainty in the calculations of background cross section is extremely essential for the determination of the lhc discovery potential . some other examples are presented in tables 2 - 7 and in figs.13 - 14 .",
    "in this paper we have described a method to estimate the discovery potential and exclusion limits on new physics in planned experiments where only the average number of background @xmath3 and signal events @xmath2 is known .",
    "we have found that in this case the more proper definition of the significance ( for @xmath147 ) is @xmath148 in comparison with often used expressions for the significances @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "for @xmath92 we have additional additive contribution to the significance ( see approximate formulae 19 - 20 of estimation of discovery potential for given discovery probability ) . as a result",
    ", the effective significance @xmath59 of signal for given probability of observation is proposed .",
    "the results of direct calculations of dependences @xmath2 versus @xmath3 for different discovery probabilities and significances are presented .",
    "we estimate the influence of systematic uncertainty related to nonexact knowledge of signal and background cross sections on the probability to discover new physics in planned experiments .",
    "an account of such kind of systematics is very essential in the search for supersymmetry and leads to an essential decrease in the probability to discover new physics in future experiments .",
