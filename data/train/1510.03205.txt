    "the trading at stock exchanges is organized by the order book whose main purpose is to provide the same information to all market participants .",
    "although often ignored in the model building , it has a large impact on the price dynamics and thus on the stylized facts as well as on the more specific features  @xcite .",
    "the stock price is determined via a continuous double auction  @xcite , in which some traders submit market orders for immediate transactions at the best available price , while other traders submit limit orders which specify an acceptable price for the trade .",
    "the limit orders are listed in the order book .",
    "most of them do not immediately lead to trades .",
    "the buy limit orders are referred to as bids and the sell limit orders as asks .",
    "the best ask and best bid prices are the quotes .",
    "market orders do not appear in the order book .",
    "when a market order is executed , it can either keep the quote unchanged , raise the best ask price in case of a buy market order or lower the best bid price for a sell market order .",
    "the prices change persistently as they are affected by the incoming market orders . to profit from the price difference between ask and bid ,",
    "traders provide the limit orders which leads to an anti  persistence of prices . as a result of a detailed balance between persistent and anti  persistent , _",
    "i.e. _ , between super and subdiffusive behavior , the price on an intraday scale moves diffusively like a random walk  @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", a high autocorrelation of the order flow was empirically found  @xcite .",
    "the splitting of orders over longer times introduces the long memory of the order flow  @xcite with remarkable persistence . buy ( sell ) orders are often followed by more buy ( sell ) orders .",
    "furthermore , the relation between trades and price changes has received considerable attention  @xcite the efficient market hypothesis ( emh )  @xcite states that all available information is processed and encoded in the current price , which would rule out any ( statistical ) arbitrage opportunities .",
    "while this is in conflict with the very different time scales on which , first , relevant new information arrives and , second , the prices change , the model of zero intelligence trading ( zit )  @xcite simply assumes randomly acting trader , but also arrives at a memory ",
    "less random walk .",
    "based on the emh , there are two major approaches to explain the impact of trades on the stock price change . the first approach put forward by lillo and farmer ( lf )  @xcite , suggests that the price impact is permanent , but fluctuates with order size .",
    "the impact is caused by an asymmetry in liquidity which is induced by the trade .",
    "the response exhibits a power ",
    "law relation between order size and price change  @xcite . in the second approach , bouchaud , gefen , wyart and potters ( bgpw )",
    "@xcite argue that the price impact is transient , but fixed with order size .",
    "the fact that the impact decays with time is a result of price mean reversion .",
    "moreover , they identify the relation between order size and price response as logarithmic  @xcite .",
    "gerig  @xcite suggests that the two approaches lf and bgpw are equivalent and can be related by exchanging variables .",
    "he also argues that the impact comes from the asymmetric liquidity rather than the price mean reversion .",
    "there are numerous studies devoted to the price response , but they all focus on one single stock . here , we go beyond this and investigate the role of correlations .",
    "we carry out a large  scale empirical study of real  time trade data and find a non  vanishing price response across different stocks .",
    "we shed light on the price impact from trades in different stocks by discussing the efficiency of the financial market and by analyzing how the stocks respond to the whole market and to different economic sectors .",
    "we thereby present a first complete view of the response in the market as a whole and identify several structural characteristics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ section2 ] , we present our data set of stocks and provide some basic definitions . in sect .",
    "[ section3 ] , we show the empirical results , which indicate the existence of trade sign correlation and price response in different stocks , we also estimate the response noise . in sect .",
    "[ section4 ] , we discuss the trade impact on the prices from the viewpoint of market efficiency .",
    "we introduce and work out two types of average response in sect .",
    "[ section5 ] , an active and a passive one . in sect .",
    "[ section6 ] , we compare the self ",
    "response with the various cross  responses .",
    "we give our conclusions in sect .",
    "[ section7 ] .",
    "in sect .  [ sec21 ] , we present the data set that we use in our analysis . we discuss the proper choice of time convention in sect .",
    "[ sec22 ] .",
    "our study is based on the data from nasdaq stock market in the year 2008 .",
    "nasdaq is a purely electronic stock exchange , whose trades and quotes ( taq ) data set contains the time , price and volume .",
    "this information is not only given for the trades with all successive transactions , but also for the quotes with all successive best buy and sell limit orders .",
    "to investigate the response across different stocks in sect .",
    "[ section3 ] , we select six companies from three different economic sectors traded in the nasdaq stock market in 2008 .",
    "the stocks we analyzed are listed in table  [ table1 ] together with their acronyms and the corresponding economic sectors .",
    "[ b ]    .company information [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table3 ]    the fitting parameters and errors are shown in table  [ table3 ] .",
    "the remarkable result is that the volatile short memory of the individual correlators turns into a long memory with exponents smaller than one after averaging .",
    "the only exception is the passive trade sign correlator for the stock xom .",
    "we thus infer that the price changes caused by trade sign correlations in different stocks can accumulate to persist over longer times .",
    "another observation which can be made in fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] is that the responses vary for different economic sectors . in other words ,",
    "the stocks from different sectors may produce different average responses to a given stock .",
    "we calculate the average response of the stocks aapl , gs and xom to ten economic sectors in the s@xmath0p 500 index .",
    "the passive and active responses are displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig.7 ] and  [ fig.8 ] , respectively .",
    "clear differences are seen .            regarding the passive responses , the prices of the three stocks considered",
    "are all affected by the trades within their own sectors , especially xom , which is not surprising due to common economic effects . moreover ,",
    "the price of the stock aapl is also easily influenced by both energy ( e ) and financials ( f ) , similar observation hold for the price of gs in relation to information technology ( it ) and energy ( e ) .",
    "regarding the active response , the trades of aapl and gs have a significant impact on the prices of the stocks from financials ( f ) significantly , but a lesser one utilities ( u ) , health care ( hc ) , and consumer staples ( cs ) .",
    "this might be due to the stability of these sectors which serve the needs of daily life .",
    "the trades of xom are more likely to influence energy ( e ) , but have a lesser effect on health care ( hc ) and consumer staples ( cs ) .",
    "this is so because utilities ( u ) are economically more strongly coupled to energy ( e ) than to health care ( hc ) and consumer staples ( cs ) .",
    "it is important to compare the self ",
    "response to the various cross - responses . in fig .",
    "[ fig.9 ] , we show the self  responses for aapl , gs and xom together with cross - responses as well as together with the active and passive , _",
    "i.e. _ with averaged responses .            typically , the self  response is stronger than the cross ",
    "response for two stocks due to the strong auto - correlation of trade signs .",
    "the example of xom , however , shows that the cross  response can be stronger than the self  response . from fig .",
    "[ fig.6 ] , we know the aapl and cvx are influential stocks .",
    "their trades are more likely to impact the price change of other stocks , such that the influenced stock , _",
    "xom , responds to them more strongly than to itself .",
    "the average responses are always weaker than the self  response , implying that cases such as xom are rare .",
    "due to the noise reduction we can follow the average responses over a longer time interval . on shorter scales of the time lag @xmath1 , both , self and cross ",
    "responses should be considered when looking at individual stocks , but for investigating response stability , persistence or efficiency of the market as a whole , the average quantities give useful information on longer scales .",
    "[ fig.10 ] shows the trade sign self and cross ",
    "correlators for aapl , gs and xom corresponding to fig .  [ fig.9 ] . for the correlators between two stocks ,",
    "the correlation differences are observable for time lags of less than 10 seconds . with the lag increasing , the self ",
    "correlators are close to the cross",
    " correlators for aapl and gs .",
    "the exception of xom , however , is visible again in the sign correlators . in the research of the self ",
    "response  @xcite , a bare impact function with a power  law decay for a single trade is proposed to offset the amplification effect of sign self ",
    "correlations , which is derived from the correlation accumulation with the time lag increasing .",
    "thus , both the impact function and the sign self ",
    "correlation mutually describe the price self  response . for xom , the sign self  correlator is larger than the cross ",
    "correlators before the appearance of correlation fluctuations , but its cross  response is stronger than the self  response .",
    "it implies that the impact functions of the self and cross  responses are different . in other words",
    ", there are different impact mechanisms between the self  and cross  responses .",
    "the influential stocks , _",
    "i.e. _ aapl and cvx , amplify the impact difference in the case of xom .",
    "the average synthesizes the impacts of different stocks on individual stocks .",
    "the impacts can not be observed directly .",
    "instead , we can observe the decay of the average sign correlators .",
    "the passive and active correlators are always smaller than the self",
    " correlators for aapl , gs and xom before the appearance of correlation fluctuations , which is consistent with the case of the responses .",
    "it implies that the synthesized impact functions of the individual stocks are more stable than the ones in each stock pair .",
    "we extended the study of the responses of stock prices to trading from individual stocks to a whole correlated market .",
    "we empirically investigated the price responses to the trading of different stocks as functions of the time lag .",
    "the response functions increase and then reverse back . thus , the impact of the trades on the prices appears to be transient .",
    "pictorially speaking , the market needs time to react to the distortion of efficiency caused by the potentially informed traders . in this period of distortion",
    ", arbitrageurs drive the price to a reversion and thereby help to restore market efficiency .",
    "the price response is clearly related to the trade sign correlations for different stocks .",
    "these correlators decays in a power ",
    "law fashion , revealing a short  memory process with exponents larger than one for a stock pair .",
    "we also analyzed the market as a whole by setting up a matrix , the market response , that collects the normalized information of all response functions .",
    "several characteristic features show up which are visible in patterns having a remarkable stability in time .",
    "the market response provides quantitative information about how the trading of one stock affects the prices of other stocks , and how its own price is influenced by the trades of other stocks stocks .",
    "after this somehow microscopic view , we introduced average response functions , a passive and an active one , measuring the average price change of a given stock due to the trades of all others and the impact of trading a specific stock on the average price change of the other ones , respectively .",
    "interestingly , the passive response reverses at a relatively short time lag of dozens of seconds or so and then declines rather quickly in a volatile way , while the active response reverses at a longer time lag of some hundreds of seconds with less volatility .",
    "this is so , because the price change in one stock easily alerts the market participants .",
    "the dispersion over different stocks makes it more difficult to detect an effect .",
    "we identified the response noise as a criterion for the stability .",
    "the averaged responses considerably reduce this noise , and make generic effects visible .",
    "we also introduced the corresponding active and passive trade sign correlators .",
    "it is quite remarkable that the above mentioned short memory turns into a long memory when averaged over different stock pairs .",
    "some stocks dominate the price responses of the market in a very stable fashion during the first 7200  s. by ranking the stocks , we found that some influential stocks exhibit strong active response , but we also identified an example for a strong passive response . here , it is also important that the responses in the market vary from sector to sector .",
    "last , the self ",
    "response is compared with the various cross  responses . on shorter scales of the time lag , both the self- and cross  responses should be considered for individual stocks .",
    "but on longer scales , the average responses of individual stocks give useful information for investigating the response stability , persistence or the efficiency of the market as a whole . on the other hand ,",
    "the comparison of sign self and cross  correlators implies the existence of different impact mechanisms between self and cross  responses . by averaging the responses of individual stocks across the whole market ,",
    "the impacts of individual stocks become stable .",
