    "the large rate for the exclusive double charmonium production measured at the belle and babar experiments @xcite reveals definite problems in the theoretical description of these processes @xcite .",
    "many theoretical efforts were made in order to improve the calculation of the production cross section @xmath3 .",
    "they included the analysis of other production mechanisms for the state @xmath4 @xcite and the calculation of different corrections which could change essentially the initial nonrelativistic result @xcite . despite the evident successes achieved on the basis of nrqcd , the light cone method , quark potential models in order to resolve the discrepancy between the theory and experiment , the double charmonium production in @xmath5 annihilation remains an interesting task .",
    "on the one hand , the reason is that there exist the production processes of the p- and d - wave charmonium states which should be investigated as the production of s - wave states . on the other hand ,",
    "the variety of the used approaches and the model parameters in this problem raises the question about the comparison of the obtained results resulting in a better understanding of the quark - gluon dynamics .",
    "two sources of the enhancement of the nonrelativistic cross section for the double charmonium production are revealed to the present : the radiative corrections of order @xmath6 and relative motion of c - quarks forming the bound states .    in this work",
    "we continue the investigation of the exclusive double charmonium production in @xmath5 annihilation on the basis of a relativistic quark model @xcite in the case of s- and p - wave charmonium states .",
    "the relativistic quark model provides the solution in many tasks of heavy quark physics .",
    "in particular , it gives the possibility to study the question about a broadening of the meson wave functions due to the account of special corrections which can lead to the increase of the double charmonium production cross sections .",
    "thus , the aim of this study consists in the calculation of the relativistic effects in the processes @xmath1 on the basis of a relativistic approach to the quarkonium production suggested in refs.@xcite .",
    "we consider the following reactions @xmath7 , where the final state consists of the pair of s - wave ( @xmath8 or @xmath9 ) and p - wave ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 or @xmath13 ) charm mesons .",
    "the diagrams that give contributions to the amplitude of these processes in the leading order of the qcd coupling constant @xmath14 are presented in fig.1 .",
    "two other diagrams can be obtained by corresponding permutations .",
    "there are two stages of the production process . in the first stage , which is described by perturbative qcd , the virtual photon @xmath15 produces four heavy c - quarks and @xmath16-antiquarks with the following four - momenta :     annihilation .",

    "the dependence on the relative momenta of @xmath35-quarks is presented both in the gluon propagator @xmath53 and quark propagator as well as in the relativistic wave functions ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) .",
    "taking into account that the ratio of the relative quark momenta @xmath54 and @xmath55 to the energy @xmath0 is small , we expand the inverse denominators of quark and gluon propagators as follows : @xmath56,\\ ] ] @xmath57,\\ ] ] @xmath58+\\cdots\\right].\\ ] ] in the expansions ( 7)-(9 ) we accounted for terms of second order in relative momenta @xmath54 and third order in relative momenta @xmath55 . substituting ( 7)-(9 ) , ( 3)-(4 ) in ( 2 ) we preserve relativistic factors entering the denominators of the relativistic wave functions ( 3)-(4 ) , but in the numerator of the amplitude ( 2 ) we take into account corrections of second order in @xmath59 and up to fourth order in @xmath60 .",
    "this provides the convergence of the resulting momentum integrals .",
    "then the angular integrals are calculated using the following relations : @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63\\int_0^\\infty q^5r_{\\cal p}(q)dq,\\ ] ] where @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 are the radial momentum wave functions of s- and p - wave charmonium states , @xmath67 is the polarization vector in orbital space .",
    "the integrals in ( 10 ) and ( 12 ) look formally divergent , but the original momentum integrals contain also definite relativistic factors which lead to their convergence . for a specific p - wave state , summing over @xmath68 and @xmath69 in the amplitude ( 2 ) can be further simplified as @xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 are the clebsch - gordon coefficients . calculating the trace in the amplitude ( 2 ) by means of expressions ( 3)-(6 ) , ( 13 ) and the system form @xcite , we find that the tensor parts of the four amplitudes describing the production of s- and p - wave charmonium states in the used approximation have the following structure : @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76,\\ ] ] @xmath77 where the coefficients @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 can be presented as sums of terms containing the factors @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84^i [ ( m-\\varepsilon(q))/(m+\\varepsilon(q))]^j$ ] , preserving terms with @xmath85 , and @xmath86 up to terms of order @xmath87 .",

    ", we can calculate the differential cross section @xmath92 and then the total cross section @xmath93 as a function of @xmath94 .",
    "we find it useful to present the charmonium production cross sections in the following form ( @xmath95 corresponds to @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) :      where the functions @xmath97 ( k=0,1,2,3 ) are written explicitly in appendix b , @xmath98 @xmath99 the parameters @xmath100 can be expressed in terms of momentum integrals @xmath101 , @xmath102 as follows : @xmath103 @xmath104    on the one side , in the potential quark model the relativistic corrections , connected with the relative motion of heavy c - quarks , enter the production amplitude ( 2 ) and the cross section ( 18 ) through the different relativistic factors .",
    "they are determined in the final expression ( 18 ) by the specific parameters @xmath100 .",
    "the momentum integrals which determine the parameters @xmath100 are convergent and we calculate them numerically , using the wave functions obtained by the numerical solution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "the exact form of the wave functions @xmath105 and @xmath106 is important for improving the accuracy of the calculation of the relativistic effects .",
    "it is sufficient to note that the double charmonium production cross section @xmath107 in the nonrelativistic approximation contains the factor @xmath108 .",
    "small changes of the numerical values of the bound state wave functions at the origin lead to substantial changes of the final results . in the approach based on nonrelativistic qcd this problem is closely related to the determination of the color - singlet matrix elements for the charmonium @xcite .",
    "thus , on the other side , there are relativistic corrections to the bound state wave functions @xmath109 , @xmath106 . in order to take them into account",
    ", we suppose that the dynamics of a @xmath110-pair is determined by the qcd generalization of the standard breit hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath111 @xmath112,~~a_1=\\frac{31}{3}-\\frac{10}{9}n_f,~~\\beta_0=11-\\frac{2}{3}n_f,\\ ] ] @xmath113+\\frac{\\pi c_f\\alpha_s}{m^2}\\delta({\\bf r})+\\frac{3c_f\\alpha_s}{2m^2r^3}({\\bf s}{\\bf l})-\\ ] ] @xmath114-\\frac{c_ac_f\\alpha_s^2}{2mr^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath115 is the number of flavors , @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the color factors of the su(3 ) color group . for the dependence of the qcd coupling constant @xmath118 on the renormalization point @xmath119 we use the leading order result @xmath120",
    "the typical momentum transfer scale in a quarkonium is of order of the quark mass , so we set the renormalization scale @xmath121 and @xmath122 gev , which gives @xmath123 for the charmonium states .",
    "the parameters of the linear potential @xmath124 and @xmath125 gev have usual values of quark models . starting with the hamiltonian ( 23 ) we construct the effective potential model based on the schrdinger equation and",
    "find its numerical solutions in the case of s- and p - wave charmonium @xcite . the details of the used model are presented in appendix c. then we calculate the matrix elements entering in the expressions for the parameters @xmath100 and obtain the value of the production cross sections at @xmath0=10.6 gev .",
    "basic parameters which determine our numerical results are collected in table i. the comparison of the obtained results with the previous calculations @xcite and experimental data @xcite is presented in table ii .",
    "the wave functions ( c5 ) give a good approximation of the true quark bound state wave functions in the region of nonrelativistic momenta .",
    "using ( c5 ) , we transform ( c4 ) as follows : @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the bound state energy of quarks which can be obtained from the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian @xmath128 . in order to derive ( c6 ) we changed the operator @xmath129 by its nonrelativistic expression : @xmath130\\psi_0 $ ] . as a result of such transformations",
    "the potential @xmath131 takes the following form in the case of s - states : +        a similar transformation of the breit hamiltonian can be done for the p - wave states . in table iii we present the results of the calculation of the charmonium mass spectrum and a comparison with the existing experimental data .",
    "the obtained masses agree with the experimental ones within an accuracy @xmath134 per cent .",
    "so , we can suppose that the obtained effective hamiltonian allows to account relativistic corrections in the bound state wave functions with sufficiently good accuracy .",
