    "very recently , we have discovered a strange tribaryon , s@xmath8(3115 ) , via the @xmath10 reaction @xcite . the observed state has isospin @xmath9 , charge @xmath11 and mass @xmath12 @xmath13 3117 mev/@xmath5 .",

    "the s@xmath8(3115 ) discovery was originally motivated by the theoretical prediction of a deeply - bound kaonic state by akaishi and yamazaki at @xmath15 = 3194 mev/@xmath5 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite , which can only be studied via the @xmath18 reaction . in this reaction , both isospin @xmath14 = 0 and 1 states can be populated , while the reaction ( [ eq : k - p - reaction ] ) is limited to forming @xmath14 = 1 .",
    "we describe the study of the neutron spectrum obtained from reaction ( [ eq : k - n - reaction ] ) to provide further important information on the strange tribaryon .",

    "[ fig : setup ] . for this purpose",
    ", we need to define the kaon reaction point by the vertex between the trajectory of an incoming kaon and that of an outgoing charged particle detected by two layered trigger counters ( tc ) , namely tc@xmath21 and tc@xmath22 .",
    "the resolution of the reaction points / vertex was @xmath13 5 @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , which is predominantly determined by kaon multiple scattering in the target helium .",
    "the kaon reaction at - rest in the target volume was selected ( purity @xmath25 ) by using the correlation between the pulse height of the final beam counter ( t0 ) and the range in the helium target obtained by the vertex position .",
    "the reaction ( neutron tof start ) timing was calculated from the t0 timing and the kaon range in the target , and the neutron was detected by two sets of plastic scintillation counter arrays ( nc ) .",
    "an absolute time calibration of the tof was performed by electromagnetic showers produced in iron - plate converters , placed between nc veto counters and nc , itself .",
    "the overall tof resolution was measured by this shower event , and was found to be @xmath26 .",
    "the absolute momentum was checked using mono - energetic neutrons from @xmath27 decay at rest ( @xmath28 ) by back - to - back coincidence with the threshold at 3 mev @xmath29 @xmath30 ( mev@xmath31 ) applied to nc .    in a following analysis , we set a rather high energy threshold to the nc system ( 10 mev@xmath31 ) at the analysis stage , so as to reduce the accidental neutron background . at this threshold , an nc counter of 5 cm thickness become sensitive at @xmath13 150 mev/@xmath32 , and saturate at @xmath13 340 mev/@xmath32 . beyond this , the efficiency is constant at @xmath13 20% .",

    "focused on pions that came from if these pions come from hyperon decay , the mother hyperon could be qualitatively identified by the pion momentum .",
    "the momentum of the pion from @xmath34 distributes dominantly in the lower momentum side ( mostly below 100 mev/@xmath32 ) compared to that from a charged @xmath35 ( centered at about 190 mev/@xmath32 ) @xcite .    for a further study",
    ", we proceeded to an analysis of the hyperon motion based on the vertex inconsistency .",
    "if the hyperon moves a certain length , the two trajectories between the incoming kaon and the outgoing charged pion could be separated by the motion before the decay . on the other hand ,",
    "if the triggered pion come from the quasi - free hyperon production ( qf : @xmath36 ) , the vertex should coincide within the experimental resolution .",
    "if the main decay channel of @xmath37 is similar to that of @xmath38 , then one can assume that the @xmath39 is the major decay channel .",
    "thus one expects @xmath40 which is an ideal model to apply the analysis procedure described above , because @xmath37 is expected to be boosted at the formation stage .",
    "let us define the event window using the tc information . fig .",
    "[ fig : dedxcont ] shows the scatter plot of @xmath41 on two layers of the tc counters . to select high - momentum pions (",
    "@xmath42 @xmath43 125 mev/@xmath32 ) , which mainly come from @xmath44 decay , we proceeded as follows . from the simulation , we know that the pions , which penetrate both layers ( @xmath42 @xmath43 100 mev/@xmath32 ) , should distribute mostly inside the dashed region .",
    "we evaluated the distribution center by using an average of the data within this region .",
    "the central track obtained is shown in the figure as a solid line , and the evaluation of the momentum along the track led us to select the `` fast @xmath33 '' triggered event window ( hatched area in the dashed region ) .",
    "this window is well apart from the `` proton '' window shown in the figure .",
    "the `` slow @xmath33 '' triggered event window is defined so as to select pions that stop in the tc counters ( @xmath42 @xmath45 90 mev/@xmath32 ) .",
    "apart from the region shown in the figure , we also included a very slow pion which had already stopped in tc@xmath46 , because these events can be easily selected by the pulse height and tdc information .",
    "scatter plot of de / dx on tc@xmath22 ( horizontal- ) and tc@xmath21 ( vertical - axis ) counters .",
    "definition of `` proton '' , `` slow @xmath33 '' and `` fast @xmath33 '' triggered events are given in the figure . ]",
    "[ fig : slow - fast - pi ] shows the neutron momentum spectra for `` proton '' ( lower left ) , `` slow @xmath33 '' ( upper right ) and `` fast @xmath33 '' ( lower right ) triggered events tag .",
    "there exists a common structure up to @xmath13 400 mev/@xmath32 .",
    "this low - momentum component mainly comes from the @xmath47 absorption reaction ( occurring in or around the target ) , @xmath48 @xcite , and cascade reactions followed by qf - hyperon formation @xcite .",
    "the `` slow @xmath33 '' triggered neutron spectrum has a `` plateau '' structure beyond @xmath13 450 mev/@xmath32 .",
    "this comes from the kaon non - mesonic absorption and its chain , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the neutron from the non - mesonic kaon absorption reaction .",
    "note that pions from @xmath35 decays do not contribute when we select low - momentum pions @xcite . the spectrum shape of @xmath50 is dominantly determined by three - body phase space and the nuclear form factor , and is very broad , as shown in the figure .",
    "it has a maximum momentum of @xmath13 700 mev/@xmath32 , and forms a `` flat - plateau '' below @xmath13 600 mev/@xmath32 .",
    "similar to the `` slow @xmath33 '' triggered events , the neutron spectrum of `` fast @xmath33 '' triggered events is expected to have a high - momentum component due to @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the neutron at the primary reaction and @xmath53 is that from @xmath54 decay . the @xmath52 should have a nature very similar to the @xmath50 in reaction ( [ eq : knn - ln ] ) , but shifted by @xmath13 100 mev/@xmath32 to the lower side .",
    "therefore , a `` plateau '' below @xmath13 500 mev/@xmath32 is expected . actually , the `` proton '' triggered event is not selective to @xmath50 , @xmath52 or @xmath53 , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : slow - fast - pi ] ( lower left ) .",
    "there exists a peak - like structure at @xmath13 470 mev/@xmath32 in the `` fast @xmath33 '' triggered event ( fig .",
    "[ fig : slow - fast - pi ] ( lower right ) ) , at the momentum where we expect a `` plateau '' due to @xmath52 and @xmath53 . is this peak - like structure due to the formation of the intermediate state s@xmath7 ?",
    "as shown in the figure , the answer largely depends on what the background state is .",
    "and where the background level is around this region .",
    "if this peak - like structure indicates the formation of s@xmath7 , then the major decay will be @xmath39 , because the structure appears only in the `` fast @xmath33 '' triggered spectrum . to make the existence clear",
    ", we need to study the spectrum in more detail by analyzing the hyperon motion .",
    "the most simple way to detect the hyperon motion is by a vertex inconsistency between the two tracks of an incoming kaon and an outgoing trigger particle ( so called distance - of - closest - approach ) . in the present case ,",
    "however , the hyperon and the neutron motions are asymmetric in many reactions ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : event3 ] ) . for a further analysis ,",
    "let us introduce a scalar product , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the vector from the kaon trajectory to that of the charged pion at the minimum distance , and @xmath57 is the normalized vector of the detected neutron .",
    "[ fig : vcavp ] shows the @xmath55 distribution of `` fast @xmath33 '' triggered events having nc - detected neutron momenta @xmath58 400 mev/@xmath32 . for a comparison ,",
    "the decomposed spectra obtained by a simulation are shown .",
    "as shown in the simulation , @xmath59 and @xmath53 roughly distribute symmetrically on opposite sides .",
    "example of the event topologies .",
    "the s@xmath7 formation topology is shown at the top .",
    "if the q - value of s@xmath7 formation is large , then the s@xmath7 is boosted to the opposite direction of the signal neutron , which results in the @xmath55 being distributed on the negative side .",
    "the background reaction ( [ eq : knn - sn ] ) is shown at the bottom .",
    "although the two topologies are quite similar , the scalar product , @xmath55 , is negative ( backward ) if @xmath52 is detected by the neutron counter , while it is positive ( forward ) for @xmath60 . ]",
    "@xmath55 distribution .",
    "the dots with error bars show the data of the `` fast @xmath33 '' triggered events associated with a high - momentum neutron ( @xmath58 400 mev/@xmath32 ) . the decomposition into key components , given by the simulation , is also shown .",
    "to make the signal formation component visible , the s@xmath7 is simulated with a formation probability of 1% per stopped @xmath61 , and decays purely into @xmath62 , which is the most efficient branch to detect in this @xmath55 selection . ]",
    "if the peak - like structure obtained in fig .",
    "[ fig : slow - fast - pi ] ( lower right ) is due to the formation of an intermediate state , s@xmath7 , then it should be boosted opposite to the neutron with the same momentum , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : event3 ] ( top ) .",
    "it should then decay dominantly to @xmath63 rather than @xmath64 , as is the case for s@xmath8 , since we observe the structure only for a `` fast @xmath33 '' triggered event .",
    "what is the centroid of the momentum of the decay @xmath54 ?",
    "we calculated the momentum , and found that it is about 450 mev/@xmath32 in the backward direction , while it is about 80 mev/@xmath32 in forward direction .",
    "thus , the @xmath55 distribution for such events should be asymmetric and dominantly located on the negative side .",
    "this is the reason for the shape of the distribution of the simulated signal given in fig .",
    "[ fig : vcavp ] .",
    "unfortunately , there is no clear criterion about how to separate the signal from the background .",
    "simple `` forward '' and `` backward '' comparisons may not be valid , because the yield and the spectral shape can also be weakly asymmetric between the `` forward '' ( @xmath53 ) and `` backward '' ( @xmath65 ) directions .",
    "therefore , we examined how to compare the event sets between higher s / n ( hsn : indicated with arrow ) and lower s / n ( lsn : shallow hatched ) regions , whose windows are defined as shown in the figure .",
    "hsn is defined to be where we expect a better signal - to - noise ratio than in the other regions .",
    "the reason why we sandwiched hsn in between the two lsn regions ( inner and outer side ) , is to obtain an interpolation of the shape of the spectrum .",
    "it should be noted that both the spectrum shape and the statistics of the inner and outer lsn regions are different .",
    "if @xmath55 is close to zero , then the pion dominantly originates from the primary qf reaction , namely @xmath36 .",
    "if it is much apart from zero , the pion is dominantly from higher momentum hyperon decay , either from reaction ( [ eq : knn - ln ] ) or ( [ eq : knn - sn ] ) , which results in larger yields of the higher momentum component in the neutron spectrum .",
    "it should also be noted that the lsn data are @xmath66 @xmath67 free from the signal . in the case of the neutron spectra",
    ", the ratio of the signal yields between hsn and lsn is expected to be about @xmath13 2 : 1 from the simulation , if we assume that @xmath68 is the major decay branch of s@xmath7 .",
    "comparison of the momentum spectra between hsn ( closed circle ) and lsn ( open circle ) .",
    "the lsn data were scaled so as to have the total yield be the same as that of the hsn data , including the lower momentum region . to avoid the error bars from overlapping , the center of the bin is shifted by half of the bin size .",
    "the peak - like structure , observed in the `` fast @xmath33 '' triggered neutron spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : slow - fast - pi ] ( lower right ) ) , appears as a clear excess between hsn and lsn . ]",
    "[ fig : vcavp_comp ] shows a comparison of the two spectra .",
    "it exhibits a clear enhancement at around @xmath69 mev/@xmath32 in the spectrum of hsn , whereas it is smooth in lsn .",
    "because the windows for hsn and lsn are rather arbitrarily defined , we also examined the stability of the enhancement by changing the cut region , and verified that it was nearly unchanged .",
    "the same spectra - shape comparison , whose windows were chosen to be symmetric to the present one in the @xmath55 positive side , was applied to check the validity of the comparison . we found no clear excess , as was expected .",
    "missing - mass spectra of the @xmath0he@xmath70 reaction ( top ) and the @xmath0he@xmath71 reaction ( bottom ) .",
    "both proton and neutron hsn spectra were fitted assuming a smooth background . in the case of the hsn neutron spectrum ( bottom )",
    ", we could nt achieved a good fit without assuming two gaussian functions in the region of interest . ]    the missing - mass spectra both on hsn and lsn , obtained from the neutron data , are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] ( bottom ) .",
    "it shows that an enhancement exists at around the mass region from 3110 to 3160 mev / c@xmath72 . as a third and final examination",
    ", we applied exactly the same procedure to obtain the mass spectra from proton data , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] ( top ) .",
    "we fitted the data of the hsn , assuming a smooth background for both the proton and neutron spectra .",
    "the fit for the proton hsn spectrum ( background shape of a third - order polynomial was used ) gave a consistent result with that obtained in a previous paper @xcite .",
    "the excess in the neutron spectrum seems to be rather broad compared to that in the proton spectrum .",
    "it is natural to expect the isospin partner of @xmath73(3115 ) in this energy region ; hence , we fitted the hsn neutron spectrum with two gaussian functions together with a smooth background ( a single exponential ) , as shown in the figure , while fixing the mass and width of one gaussian to be the same as that of @xmath73(3115 ) . in the fit",
    ", data of lsn were not utilized to constrain the background shape / yield . because the signal is expected to appear in both hsn and lsn at a ratio of 2 : 1 , the background is expected to be located slightly below the lsn data .",
    "the result , however , is close to the data point of lsn , so that the fitted background slightly overestimated the yield in the region of interest .",
    "it is obvious that the statistical significance of the isospin partner of @xmath73(3115 ) is not enough to conclude its existence from the data itself . from the isospin rule",
    ", one can expect the formation ratio of the @xmath14 = 1 states between the neutron and the proton emission processes to be 1 : 2 .",
    "the lower neutron detection efficiency makes the ratio to be about 1 : 10 .",
    "if we assume that the decay branching ratio to the charged @xmath35 is the same from the two states , we expect the signal yield in the neutron spectrum to be about 1/10 of that in the proton spectrum , which is consistent even with the disappearance in the neutron spectrum .    on the other hand , concerning the main signal component , the fit gave an energy of 3141 @xmath3 3 mev/@xmath5 , width of 17 @xmath3 5 mev/@xmath5 and a yield of 120 @xmath3 32 counts .",
    "by folding the systematic error and the experimental resolution , we obtained a mass and width of @xmath2 3141 @xmath3 3 ( stat . ) @xmath4 @xmath74 mev/@xmath5 and @xmath75 mev/@xmath5 ( 95% @xmath76 ) , respectively .",
    "the significance of this excess , evaluated from the area of the gaussian signal and its error , is 3.7 @xmath24 .",
    "the observed excess indicates the formation of another strange tribaryon ( denoted as s@xmath7(3140 ) hereafter ) , which lies about 25 mev above s@xmath8(3115 ) . because of a lack of information about its decay branching ratio",
    ", we can not derive a reliable formation probability of s@xmath7 from the fitted yield . based on simulations ,",
    "the formation probability is below a few % per stopped @xmath77 ; otherwise , the peak should already be observed in the semi - inclusive neutron spectrum .    since the mass of the signal is much different from s@xmath8(3115 ) , and also the yield is larger than the expected one , it is unlikely to be its isospin partner .",
    "this state could be assigned to the predicted @xmath16 state , although the observed mass is much lower than the theoretical one ( 3194 mev ) .    in summary",
    ", we have found an experimental indication of another strange tribaryon s@xmath7(3140 ) in the @xmath0he(stopped-@xmath78 ) reaction .",
    "its isospin is likely to be @xmath14 = 0 , and the major decay mode is s@xmath79 .",
    "the present finding provides additional information about the strange tribaryon system .",
    "the most important finding is that both s@xmath8(3115 ) and s@xmath7(3140 ) have much smaller masses ( namely , much larger @xmath80 binding energies ) than the theoretical values . if these strange tribaryons , s@xmath8(3115 ) and s@xmath7(3140 ) , are indeed deeply bound kaonic states , then the huge total binding energies ( @xmath13 200 mev ) naturally imply the formation of a cold and dense nuclear system @xcite .",
    "these findings provide important information about the @xmath81 interaction , and may provide rich information to understand the dynamics of a dense system , such as a strange star @xcite .",
    "in such a system , a restoration of chiral symmetry can be realized , and quarks may be deconfined @xcite , which are more or less unknown as of today .",
