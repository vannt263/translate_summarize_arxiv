    "recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies have allowed the determination of a large number of cosmological parameters with unprecedented accuracy .",

    "various authors have augmented measurements of the cmb with observations of large - scale structure ( lss ) , for example , the 2df galaxy power spectrum ( percival et al . 2001 , percival et al . 2002 ) , lyman-@xmath13 forest ( mandelbaum et al . 2003 ; seljak et al . 2003 ) , sdss three - dimensional power spectrum ( tegmark et al . 2003 ) , measurements of cosmic shear ( hoekstra et al . 2002 ) and the galaxy cluster luminosity function ( allen et al . 2003a ) , and/or information on the expansion rate of the universe from measurements of the hubble constant ( freedman et al . 2001 ) and high redshift supernovae ( perlmutter et al . 1999 ; reiss et al . 1998 ) .",
    "high - resolution ( @xmath14 ) observations of cmb anisotropies provided by previously released data obtained by the very small array ( vsa , grainge et al .",

    "2004 ) and the cosmic background imager ( cbi , pearson et al .",
    "2003 ) , can also be important in reducing the impact of degeneracies and provide information on the parameters relating to the power spectrum of initial density fluctuations over a much wider range of scales .",
    "in particular , the wmap team made use of these data in their analyses in order to improve the significance of their results ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) .    in this paper , we study the cosmological implications of the new cmb power spectrum measured by the vsa which has a good signal - to - noise ratio out to a multipole of @xmath15 ( dickinson et al .",

    "the absolute calibration uncertainty for these data is reduced to @xmath17 on the power spectrum ; something which will be significant in our subsequent discussion .",
    "the power spectrum is measured between @xmath18 and @xmath15 with a resolution in @xmath19-space of @xmath20 .",

    ". our main focus will be on the initial spectrum of fluctuations , quantified by the running of the spectral index , which appears to be particularly sensitive to high - resolution data such as ours . in the case where we do not impose external priors on the cmb data ( wmap+vsa ) ,",
    "we find that there is significant evidence ( @xmath23 ) for negative running ; something which is not implied by the wmap data alone .",
    "the significance of this result is sensitive to the inclusion of external priors , the relative calibration of wmap and vsa , and possible source / cluster contamination of the measured power spectrum , illustrating issues which are of great relevance in the era of precision cosmology .",
    "the result , if true , would be a significant challenge to models of slow - roll inflation , and so we also consider a broken spectral index model . as a final point , we consider a 12-parameter model fit to wmap , wmap+vsa and all available cmb data beyond @xmath24 , illustrating the effects of external priors on the estimated parameters .",
    "our results within this model are compatible with previous determinations , both by the wmap team and others .",
    "we will define the @xmath0cdm model as follows .",
    "first , we will assume that the universe is flat and dominated by cold dark matter ( cdm ) , baryons and a cosmological constant , @xmath0 .",
    "the densities of these components relative to critical are denoted @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively and we define @xmath28 to be the overall matter density ( cdm and baryons ) in the same units . the expansion rate is quantified in terms of the hubble constant @xmath29 and we allow for instantaneous reionization at some epoch @xmath30 which can also be quantified in terms of an optical depth @xmath31 .",
    "the so - called physical densities of the cdm and baryons are defined as @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we will consider only adiabatic models and , guided by the predictions of slow - roll inflation , we parameterize the initial fluctuation spectrum of this model by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the arbitrarily chosen pivot point of the spectrum , @xmath36 is the spectral index and @xmath37 is the scalar power spectrum normalization .    we will modify this model by the inclusion of two other parameterizations of the power spectrum .",
    "we will , for the most part , consider a model with a running spectral index , @xmath38 so that the overall spectral index of fluctuations is a function of scale , @xmath39 , given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is known as the running of the spectral index .",
    "for slow roll inflation to be well defined , one requires that @xmath42 ( leach and liddle , 2003 ) . under certain choices of priors",
    "we find that there is some evidence that this inequality is violated by the preferred fits to the data .",
    "we therefore consider an alternative model , which could be motivated by broken - scale invariance models of inflation ( see , for example , barriga et al .",
    "2001 ) , but is probably best thought of as a test of whether or not the data prefer a single power - law . the specific choice we will make is to consider @xmath43 with an appropriate normalization for @xmath44 so as to make the power spectrum continuous and the same value of @xmath45 as used in the standard @xmath0cdm model .    in our discussion of systematic effects in section  [ sec : disc ]",
    ", we will consider the possibility of an extra component to the anisotropies with @xmath46 .",
    "such a component is motivated by foreground effects due to point sources and the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect from galaxy clusters along the line of sight .",
    "the temperature anisotropies due to such a component will be @xmath47 and could be significant for @xmath24 .",
    "the vsa has a sophisticated procedure to extract the effects of point sources using a dedicated , co - located , single - baseline interferometer ( see dickinson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for details ) , and the vsa fields have been chosen to avoid very luminous x - ray clusters . there could still , however , be some residual contamination",
    ". moreover , claims have been made of an excess signal between @xmath48 and @xmath49 by the cbi team ( mason et al .",
    "2003 ) , who attribute this to the sz effect .",
    "if the signal is a large as is claimed , then it could be a contaminant even at lower @xmath19 . by including such a component in the parameter fitting",
    ", it should be possible to constrain the contribution at @xmath50 as well as gaining some insights into the possible systematic effects of making such an error .",
    "the other parameters which we will consider in our analyses are : @xmath51 , the fraction of the dark matter which is massive neutrinos ; @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) , the curvature in units of the critical density ; @xmath54 , the equation - of - state parameter for a dark energy component modelled as a slowly rolling scalar field ; @xmath55 the spectral index of tensor fluctuations specified at the pivot point @xmath56 ; @xmath57 , the ratio of the amplitude of the scalar fluctuations , @xmath58 , evaluated at @xmath59 , and that of the tensor fluctuations evaluated at @xmath60 .",
    "in addition to these parameters , for which we fit , we will also comment on various derived quantities : @xmath61 , the age of the universe ; @xmath62 , the amplitude of density fluctuations in the spheres of @xmath63 .      in this paper",
    "we will consider the cosmological implications of four different combinations of cmb data .",

    "( 2004 ) combined with the cobe data ( smoot et al .",
    "1992 , bennett et al .",
    "the purpose of this particular data set is to check the consistency of the vsa data with the concordant model , without imposing the strong constraining power of the wmap data set ( bennett et al .",
    "2003 ) . * the second data set , denoted wmap contains only the wmap temperature ( tt ) data ( hinshaw et al . 2003 ) and temperature - polarization cross - correlation ( te ) data ( kogut et al . 2003 ) .",
    "we use these data sets to provide a meaningful comparison with cosmological results obtained from other data sets , avoiding differences that might arise due to the priors and other methodological issues . *",
    "the third data set contains wmap data and the new vsa data and is referred to as wmap+vsa . in this data - set",
    "we supplement the accurate measurement of the first two peaks by the wmap satellite with the vsa measurements of the power spectrum in the region between the third and fifth peaks .",
    "the importance of these data set is to illustrate the extra information that is available from the measurements of the power spectrum on small angular scales . *",
    "the last data set combines the previous two with all important cmb experiments providing measurements in the region of the second peak of the spectrum and beyond , namely cbi , acbar , boomerang , maxima , dasi ( pearson et al .",

    "this last data set is hereafter referred to as allcmb .    throughout our analysis",
    "we ignore small correlations between data sets that arise due to the fact that they have observed the same portions of the sky .",
    "this applies only to correlations between wmap , that has used nearly all the sky , and terrestrial experiments , that have observed only small patches . in all cases , the decoupling of observed angular scales and the fact that any given patch of sky observed by a terrestrial experiment makes up less than 1% of the wmap sky coverage makes this approximation truly valid and far below systematic uncertainties .",
    "in addition to the cmb data sets described above , we consider the effects of other cosmological data , not only to break the degeneracies , but also to see how the measured cmb power spectrum fits in the wider cosmological context .",

    "the 2df data measure the power spectrum of the matter fluctuations in the linear regime , which is linked to the spectrum of primordial fluctuations and the parameters of the standard model in a different manner to the cmb data and , thus , provide an important consistency check .",

    "the corresponding confidence limits on the parameter values are given in table  [ tab : general ] .        in this more general model",
    "we see that the marginalized distributions of the parameters in our simpler models have broadened somewhat , but are still consistent with our earlier findings .",
    "perhaps most interesting is the fact that some of the marginalized distributions change considerably as more cmb data are used beyond wmap .",

    "an analogous effect is observed for @xmath41 , for which the addition of vsa data significantly reduces the tail of the distribution for positive values of @xmath41 .",
    "the remaining marginalized distributions have very similar forms for each of the three cmb data sets , indicating that , for these parameters , the addition of further cmb beyond wmap does not have a significant effect on their derived values and confidence limits .",

    "once again , we see that the inclusion of the @xmath154 and xlf external priors has the greatest effect on the confidence limits , and that this is most pronounced for the xlf prior and the parameters @xmath147 , @xmath69 and @xmath95 .",
    "it is reassuring , however , that the derived limits on @xmath147 for the general model are very similar to those obtained assuming the simpler flat model .",

    "the effect of the xlf prior on @xmath69 and @xmath95 in the general model is also similar to that observed in the simpler flat case .",

    "as we have pointed out already , the value of @xmath41 preferred by the data is incompatible with the basic premises of slow - roll inflation .",
    "moreover , the negative running , which reduces the amount of power on small scales and hence the amount of structure at early times , leads to predictions for the epoch of reionization at odds with the best fit to the cmb data . this comes almost directly from the temperature - polarization cross - correlation power spectrum observed by wmap ( kogut et al .",
    "2003 ) . given the implications of this result it is important to consider the possible systematic effects that might weaken it .",
    "the absolute calibration uncertainty of the vsa power spectrum is an important contributory factor to this result .",

    "it was pointed out in dickinson et al .",
    "that , in fact , using an absolute calibration based on this measurement of @xmath220 gives the most consistent normalization of the power spectrum when compared to that of wmap .",
    "we have investigated the effects of possible uncertainties in the calibration in two ways .",
    "first , we consider the possibility of using the mason et al ( 1999 ) central value for @xmath220 while maintaining an overall uncertainty of @xmath17 . as an alternative we just increase the overall uncertainty in the calibration to @xmath132 while keeping the central value for @xmath220 from wmap .",
    "the derived limits on @xmath36 and @xmath41 are presented in table  [ tab : calib ] for these two possibilities using the hst and 2df priors .",

    "the value quoted by mason et al .",

    "however , this value and our limit are derived in very different ways .",
    "the measurement of mason et al .",
    "( 2003 ) is a direct limit from high resolution imaging of 3 deep fields .",
    "while it is direct , the measurement the global power spectrum could be significantly affected by sample variance ; one could have observed a field which in there are more clusters than the global average and hence obtain a biased estimation of the global power spectrum .",
    "our limit is indirect , coming from the power spectrum measured over 82  @xmath256 at lower angular resolution and it requires that the power spectrum be @xmath257 as well as the cosmological model to be correct .",
    "it is likely that this represents a reliable upper bound since the power spectrum will grow less rapidly than @xmath258 for @xmath259 due to the fact that the clusters responsible for the sz effect are not point sources .",
    "moreover , it is not as sensitive to the poisson distributed number of clusters in an individual field .",
    "a more realistic modelling of the sz effect using accurate power spectra could yield a more stringent upper bound .",
    "the two methods provide useful complimentary information and it is possible that a much more stringent constraint on @xmath229 will be possible when the vsa observes with higher resolution in the near future .    one important feature of the power spectrum observed by wmap is the apparent absence of power at very low @xmath19",
    ". this could be due to some as yet unknown physics , or it could be a manifestation of the interaction between the subtle systematic effects caused by the side - lobes , the galactic cut , and the power spectrum estimation algorithm used by the wmap team ( efstathiou 2003 ) .",
    "it is worth assessing to what extent our result is dependent on the measured anisotropies with @xmath260 . by excluding the multipoles with @xmath260 from our analysis we find that @xmath261 and @xmath262 , strongly suggestive of an @xmath263 , scale invariant initial power spectrum for wmap with the 2df prior , whereas @xmath264 and @xmath265 for wmap+vsa and the same prior .",
    "the weakening of the constraint on @xmath41 should not be a surprise since excluding multipoles with @xmath260 cuts out nearly a whole power of ten in @xmath266 and @xmath41 is the coefficient of a power series in @xmath134 .",
    "however , we see that the inclusion of the vsa tends to prefer a spectral index lower than just wmap .",
    "it is clear from this that the reason for the preference for a negative running of the power spectrum when multipoles with @xmath260 are included is the tension between the measurements at @xmath260 by wmap and for @xmath24 by the vsa .",
    "we should comment briefly on one aspect of our analysis of the running spectral index models which is not ideal : the preferred values of @xmath95 and @xmath31 .",
    "most recent analyses of cmb data include an upper bound one of these parameters . in spergel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) a flat prior of @xmath267 was used when in some cases the data had a preference for a high value of @xmath31 by virtue of the low-@xmath19 te correlation power spectrum ; our analysis is no different and we believe that this is responsible for the differences between our analysis and that of spergel et al ( 2003 ) . all the likelihood curves and derived limits have made the not unreasonable assumption that @xmath268 . however , in some cases , particularly those for which we have included no prior from 2df , the preferred values of @xmath95 are close to this limit , uncomfortably close in some cases and one might be concerned that our results are sensitive to this .",
    "we find that the models with @xmath41 significantly less than zero tend to have larger values of @xmath95 which explains why our derived limit of @xmath269 from wmap is larger than the one quoted in spergel et al ( 2003 ) .",
    "it also suggests that , by excluding @xmath270 , we have weakened the constraint on @xmath41 rather than artificially modifying the preferred value away from zero .",
    "an epoch of reionization with @xmath271 would seem unlikely in the context of early structures being the source of ionization , but it is clear that the data suggest it .    for the general 12-parameter @xmath0cdm model , we find that our marginalized distributions for @xmath36 and @xmath41 are broadened , as one would expect .",
    "nevertheless , even in this case , the addition of vsa data significantly reduces tails of the distributions for @xmath36 greater than unity and for positive @xmath151 , as compared with using wmap as the only cmb data set .",
    "indeed , these effects are reinforced by the use of the allcmb data set .",
    "the inclusion of additional cmb data beyond wmap also leads to a noticeable reduction in the preferred value of @xmath74 and a corresponding increase in @xmath78 .    to summarize",
    ", we find that there is evidence for @xmath12 in a limited class of models , but within the general @xmath0cdm model with 12 parameters the evidence is much weaker .",
    "standard models of inflation are generally incompatible with such large negative values of @xmath41 , but the data appears to point in that direction , although not totally conclusively .",
    "the inclusion of an external prior from 2df appears to weaken the result by fixing @xmath128 in conjunction with the cmb data .",
    "the measurement of @xmath272 using the galaxy power spectrum is responsible for this shift .",
    "it is an interesting question as to how reliable this measurement is since a slight shift in the results , a preference for @xmath273 rather than @xmath274 would bring their preferred value into line with that suggested by the cmb alone and would uphold the possibility of @xmath12 .",
    "since none of the galaxy redshift surveys have conclusively observed the turnover in the power spectrum on which this determination of @xmath272 is based we assert that there is still room for some doubt .",
    "we have also investigated the possible systematic effects which could weaken our result .",
    "we believe that the assumptions behind the power spectrum measurements presented in dickinson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) are the best available using the observations which we have made and the other information from the literature we have used . for sure",
