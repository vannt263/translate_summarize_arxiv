    "a link between active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and major galaxy mergers has been seen in luminous infrared galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "radial streaming motions during a merging event can efficiently feed gas to the central black hole ( bh ) , and trigger agn in late - stage mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the final stages of mergers are accompanied by a blow - out phase , expelling gas and dust into the intergalactic medium and quenching the star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "recent numerical simulations that incude merger - driven fueling and `` agn feedback '' reproduce several observed properties of the galaxy populations , such as the bh mass  bulge mass correlation or the rapid build  up of massive spheroids ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "therefore , agn feedback has gradually been recognized as an important process in the evolution of galaxies .",
    "arp 187 is a merger remnant at the distance of @xmath4 ( and the equivalent luminosity distance of @xmath5  mpc ) . using alma cycle  0 observations , @xcite find two 3  mm continuum components located at both sides of the nucleus of arp  187 , spanning 4  kpc .",
    "these components are identified as small scale radio jets from high - resolution vla archival images at 4.9  ghz and 8.5  ghz , which clearly show the morphology of the radio lobes . assuming the jet angle to the line of sight of 90  and a typical expansion speed of radio lobes ( 0.1@xmath6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the kinematic age of the radio - jets is estimated to be @xmath7  yr , which is quite young . although the similar candidates have been found recently in the relatively distant universe at @xmath8 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , as of our knowledge there are no candidates in the local universe with @xmath9 due to their rare populations .",
    "considering the properties above , arp 187 is a good nearby candidate of agn feedback study where agn feedback has just started but not completed the star formation quenching ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for the molecular gas and the jet interaction study ) .    while arp 187 has radio - jets , it is still not clear whether its agn activity is still on - going due to the absence of previous studies .",
    "the most secure way to identify agn is a hard x - ray observation , because there is no strong bias against absorption up to @xmath10 based on theoretical ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and observational studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the 70-month integration of _",
    "swift_/bat 14195  kev all - sky survey @xcite did not detect arp 187 , constraining the luminosity of @xmath11 .",
    "this suggests that agn activity in arp  187 might be already weaken and/or obscured .",
    "infrared ( ir ) observations give us another secure way to find agn since the agn dust torus emission is dominated in mid - ir @xcite .",
    "utilizing the _ spitzer _ mid - ir imaging data , @xcite found agn signs in the southern nucleus of ngc  3256 hosting molecule outflows @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed _",
    "spitzer_/irs 538  @xmath1 m spectra of lirgs and decomposed the spectra into starburst ( sb ) and agn components using a sb galaxy template and clumpy torus models @xcite supported by observations @xcite . in this letter , we report the investigation of agn activity embedded in arp  187 through the optical , ir , and radio - band studies . throughout the paper ,",
    "we adopt @xmath12  km  s@xmath3  mpc@xmath3 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "the optical spectra enable us to disentangle type-2 agn and starburst galaxy using the optical line ratios .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we examined an archival optical spectrum obtained by the 6df galaxy survey @xcite .",
    "it is noted that the spectra of 6df survey are not properly flux calibrated , but the flux ratio of adjacent lines is still useful . the spectrum covers a range from 3900  to 7500  with the fiber aperture of 6.7  arcsec ( equivalent to @xmath15  kpc at @xmath4 ) . although there is a clear detection of crucial line sets for the bpt diagram including h@xmath16 , [ oiii]@xmath17 , h@xmath18 , and [ nii]@xmath19 , one should use caution to obtain h@xmath16 line flux as the additional spectral decomposition is necessary to estimate how much the h@xmath16 absorption line from the host galaxy affects the observed h@xmath16 emission line .",
    "we used [ n ii]@xmath20/h@xmath18 only because the concern above should be negligible for these two lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the left panel of figure  1 shows the spectrum of arp  187 around the h@xmath18 line",
    ". the derived flux ratio of [ n ii]@xmath20/h@xmath18 is 0.79 .",

    ", we measured h@xmath18 absorption strength from the spectrum template of elliptical galaxy in @xcite , resulting the estimated equivalent width is small with @xmath211  . considering h@xmath18 equivalent width of arp 187 is @xmath2120 , the effect is only @xmath215% , shifting the ratio of [ nii]/ha from 0.79 to 0.74 .",
    "this does not change our main result .",
    "another caveat is that the observed [ n ii]@xmath20/h@xmath18 could be shifted by a radio - jet shock excitation .",
    "@xcite showed that fast shock can mimic the position of the source into the agn locus in the bpt diagram if the galaxy emission is fully dominated by shocks .",
    "however , in reality , shocks rarely dominate a galaxy s global emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . using the large sample of radio - loud and radio - quiet agn in the sdss survey",
    ", @xcite showed that both agn locate remarkably similar positions in the bpt diagram , suggesting that the radio - shock contribution could be negligible for most of the radio - loud sources in the local universe .",
    "further checks on the radio - jet contribution will be explored after obtaining the flux calibrated high spatial optical spectra or integral field unit ( ifu ) .",
    "we obtained _",

    "spitzer_/irs sources ( cassis ; * ? ? ?",
    "as cassis identified arp  187 as an extended source with a spatial extent of 4.5 arcsec , it used the extraction aperture width which scales with the spatial extent to account for all of the source s flux .",
    "the obtained irs spectra include the [ oiv]25.89  @xmath1 m line with an ionization potential of @xmath22  ev @xcite , which is one of the indicators of agn and small contamination from the starburst ( @xmath23% of the line flux in agn on average ; * ? ? ?",
    "the spectra of arp  187 shows a marginal detection of the [ oiv]25.89  @xmath1 m line at s / n@xmath24 , suggesting a weak agn nlr activity .",

    "@xcite also reported the relationship between @xmath25}$ ] and agn 13.5  @xmath1 m mir continuum luminosity @xmath29 , @xmath30 suggesting that the expected @xmath31  erg s@xmath3 and @xmath32  erg s@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "note that the intrinsic scatter of each luminosity - luminosity relations is large with @xmath210.30.5 dex .",
    "we decompose the irs spectra into a combination of stellar direct , host galaxy , and agn .",
    "we use the idl routine of @xcite called deblendirs .",
    "it prepares a linear combination of three spectral templates of agn , the stars ( `` str '' ) , and the interstellar medium of the host galaxy ( `` pah '' ) , all of which are selected from a large library of irs spectra from the sources with `` pure - agn '' , `` pure - stellar '' , and `` pure - interstellar '' spectra .",
    "a further description of the decomposition method is given in section 2 of @xcite .",
    "we apply this spectral decomposition routine to the obtained irs spectra .",
    "we only use the irs short band ( 5.014.0  @xmath1 m ) to follow the same manner as @xcite .",
    "they noted that it is difficult to distinguish between the continuum emission of the agn and the host at the longer wavelength with @xmath33  @xmath1 m .",
    "in addition , the fraction of the total continuum from the agn decrease drastically at longer wavelength with the combined effects of a steeply rising emission from dust heated by star formation .    in order to check whether an agn component contribute to the ir spectra , we first fit the irs only with str+pah component . the best fitting result is achieved with the str contribution of 3.9% and pah contribution of 96.1% .",
    "the pah is the dominant component in the spectra as shown in figure  2 .",
    "the resultant reduced @xmath34 value is @xmath35 .",
    "then we fit the spectra again with str+pah+agn component .",
    "the best fit is achieved with the str contribution of 3.0% , pah contribution of 95.5% , and agn contribution of 1.6% with the reduced @xmath34 value of @xmath36 .",
    "the improvement of the fit based on the f - test shows that the probability is @xmath37 , which is larger than 0.05 , suggesting that the addition of agn component does not give significant improvement to explain the spectra .",
    "therefore we conclude that the thermal emission from agn is already weak or diminished in arp  187 .",
    "one caveat is the possibility that the thermal emission from agn is hidden within the scatter of the irs spectra .",
    "the averaged s / n at each bin of the spectra with @xmath38 enables us to give an upper limit of agn torus thermal emission . the upper limit of agn 12  @xmath1 m luminosity is @xmath39  erg  s@xmath3 .",
    "using the @xmath40@xmath41 luminosity relations of nearby seyfert galaxies obtained by @xcite , @xmath42  erg  s@xmath3 .",
    "the estimated bat x - ray luminosity is @xmath43  erg  s@xmath3 using the ratio of 2.1 under the assumption of photon index of @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the non - detection at _ swift_/bat survey . comparing the luminosities with those expected from [ oiv ]  25.89  @xmath1 m lines are insightful because the agn thermal emission originates from the central @xmath45  pc , while [ oiv ]  25.89  @xmath1 m line emission would arise from the nlr with @xmath46  kpc scale .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath41 is one order of magnitude smaller than the expected @xmath47 from [ o iv]25.89  @xmath1 m line .",
    "the upper limit of x - ray luminosities are comparable or slightly smaller than the expected value from [ o iv]25.89  @xmath1 m lines .    on the intrinsic nuclear agn activity ,",
    "final check should be done by direct high sensitive x - ray observations .",
    "@xcite and/or _ astro - h _ @xcite give us the detailed information including the hard x - ray ( @xmath48  kev ) band @xcite .",
    "the spectra can be obtained in 370  kev band with 40  ksec exposure up to @xmath49  @xmath50 under the assumption of photon index of @xmath44 @xcite . even in the compton - thick case with @xmath51  @xmath50",
    ", the detection can be achievable with the s / n@xmath52 around 1020  kev band .",
    "therefore , the future x - ray observations are effective and highly encouraged to confirm whether or not the agn activity exists in arp  187 .",
    "another caveat is the contamination from the jet synchrotron emission to the irs spectra .",
    "we check the contribution of jet - emission in the irs band by extrapolating the power - law obtained from the radio bands between 80  mhz and 10  ghz from nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "the contribution of the extrapolated ir emission is three orders of magnitude lower than the observed spectra by _",
    "spitzer_/irs , therefore we conclude the jet - contamination in the irs band for arp  187 is negligible .",
    "the fundamental plane of bh activity gives a relation among x - ray luminosity , core radio luminosity and the bh mass @xcite .",
    "based on the nucleus @xmath53 band photometry in @xcite , arp 187 has a stellar mass of @xmath54  @xmath55 with srsic index of @xmath56 , suggesting that arp 187 has a bulge dominated galaxy .",
    "therefore , @xmath57 . using the @xmath58@xmath59 scaling relation of @xcite , the estimated mass @xmath60  @xmath55 is given .",
    "the central core ( @xmath61  arcsec , which is equivalent to @xmath62  pc ) of arp  187 is not detected in the vla 4.9  ghz archival image , and the 3@xmath63 upper limit of the radio flux is 210  @xmath1jy , corresponding to @xmath64  erg  s@xmath3 . combining those two parameters and the equation of the updated fundamental plane of @xcite enables us to derive the upper limit of 210  kev luminosity with @xmath65  erg  s@xmath3 .",
    "some studies suggest that a low - eddington case might follow the different fundamental relation @xcite",
    ". the nucleus of arp 187 could be in those cases . applying the relation of @xcite",
    "gives a larger upper limit of @xmath66  erg  s@xmath3 .",
    "either case is consistent with the result of very weak or absent of thermal emission of agn discussed in section  3 .",
    "we discuss the results of our optical , ir , and radio studies . while arp  187 hosts small jets with the age of @xmath67 yr , the non - detection of the radio - core and weak or diminished thermal emission from agn torus in the ir band prefers the absence of an agn activity in arp  187 , therefore we conclude that the galaxy s central engine has decreased the energy output by at least a few orders of magnitude within @xmath7 yr .",
    "the results of optical bpt diagram and the marginal detection of [ o iv]25.89  @xmath1 m indicate that the nlr of arp  187 is still alive .",
    "considering the size of nlr is larger for three to four order of magnitude ( 110  kpc ) compared to the thermal emission region ( called torus ; @xmath45  pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of agn , nlr activity traces the past activity at least @xmath68  yr ago considering the light travel time from the central engine to the nlr ( same method was employed by the authors of * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is consistent with the sign of past activity in the radio - jet and its age is @xmath7  yr . combining all the results , agn in arp  187 was active at least @xmath68  yr ago , but it is already quenched now and only the extended area leaves the signature of past agn activity . the similar type of populations were reported previously .",
    "one is called changing - look agn .",
    "@xcite reported the fading agn that experienced over one order of magnitude optical / x - ray flux declining within 10 yr and drastic disappearance of broad h@xmath16 component .",
    "this change might be caused by the declining of accretion rate @xcite .",
    "another similar population is called `` hanny s voorwerp '' , which has a faded central engine , but the larger scale nlr emission has been seen as the light echo of agn @xcite .",
    "these studies of voorwerps estimate the quenching time scale to @xmath68 yrs via the geometry of their spatial extent .",
    "one question arises how the sudden quenching of agn occurs within @xmath68  yr .",
    "@xcite discussed the possibility of such short quenching time scale of agn with an analogy of x - ray black hole binary study .",
    "state changes of grs 1915 + 105 with a bh mass of 10  @xmath55 occur with the time scale of 1  hr . extrapolating the bh mass - time variation relation above to arp  187 with @xmath69",
    ", the state change can occur with the time scale of @xmath70  yr , which is in accordance with the estimated time scale from nlr and radio - jet within an order of magnitude .",
    "this also may support that arp  187 has experienced the state transition from a high state to a radiatively inefficient state where the energy is released mainly as kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "the presence of a radio - jet also favors the hypothesis above if the launch of the jet is associated with the state change .",
    "arp  187 is a good nearby candidate for future observations of both central engine with _",
