    "two - dimensional electron systems ( 2des ) of high - mobility can be experimentally realized in modern semiconductor devices near interfaces . in particular , the limit of a strong magnetic field normal to the interface offers the opportunity to study an electronic system , which is unique in many respects . due to the strong field , all",
    "electrons can be accommodated in the lowest orbital landau level of quenched kinetic energy resulting in a macroscopic degeneracy of the non - interacting ground state .",
    "thus , the only relevant energy scale of the system is set by the interaction energy , which turns the system into a strongly correlated one .",
    "the existence of energy gaps at certain filling factors is one of the reasons for remarkable anomalies in magneto - transport , the quantum hall effects .",
    "these exhibit features that are very different from those in lower magnetic field experiments . in the case of small occupancy of the lowest landau level",
    ", the existence of gaps can be traced back to the occurrence of an incompressible many - particle ground state .    in this introduction , we review the most important experimental and theoretical developments of the physics in the quantum hall regime and derive the appropriate many - particle hamiltonian .",
    "then , we discuss the problem of two interacting particles of equal and opposite charge , which frequently appears in the many - particle treatment",
    ".    in the second part , we study in detail the properties of the many - particle ground state and its elementary charged excitations , the quasiparticles , in the limit of an infinitely strong magnetic field neglecting the spin degree of freedom .",
    "this is explicitly done on the basis of a special model and by means of numerical methods in the case that only one third of the available one - particle states in the lowest landau level is occupied , _",
    "i.  e. _  at filling factor @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the generalizations to filling factors of the form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 are integers and @xmath3 odd .",
    "the third part is devoted to the consideration of the spin degree of freedom , which recently received a lot of attention from experiment .",
    "it is shown that at certain filling factors the ground state exhibits spontaneous spin magnetization , which defines the system as a quantum hall ferromagnet .",
    "after the discussion of the ground state properties near filling one , where novel charged spin texture excitations appear , a many - particle theory is developed to determine thermodynamic properties at exactly filling factor @xmath4 .",
    "the theory accounts for the spin - wave like excitations above a completely spin - polarized ground state .",
    "the many - particle theory improving the inadequate hartree - fock theory predicts the temperature dependence of the spin magnetization .",
    "the results are compared with recent experimental data as well as with different theoretical approaches .",
    "our considerations are based on a microscopic electronic hamiltonian .",
    "it becomes clear that this strongly correlated 2des shares many difficulties with theories of metallic ferromagnetism , yet it is free from the consequences of a complex bandstructure , which have confounded comparison with experiment .",
    "eventually , we speculate about possible routes of future research in this lively field that has offered surprises for more than twenty years .      traditionally , any microscopic description in solid state physics starts from simplified models trying to capture the essential features before systematically extending the model in order to reconcile it with the often much more complex experimental results .",
    "pursuing such an approach , we describe electrons of spin @xmath5 and charge @xmath6 moving in a three - dimensional crystal , which are subject to a spatially constant and time independent magnetic field @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , in a first approximation as independent particles in a continuum . due to the separation of the motion in the @xmath9-@xmath10-plane and the @xmath11-direction , the hamiltonian can be written in cartesian coordinates as @xmath12 here , the kinematical momentum in the plane is given by @xmath13 , whereas the momentum @xmath14 describes the free motion in the @xmath11-direction .",
    "the gauge freedom of the vector potential allows to write it as @xmath15 with the parameter @xmath16 .",
    "the gauge parameter @xmath17 covers for @xmath18 and @xmath19 the two mostly used gauges , _ viz . _",
    "the landau gauge and the symmetric gauge .",
    "the last term is the zeeman energy and is due to the coupling of the dimensionless electron s spin @xmath20 to the magnetic field ( @xmath21  gyromagnetic factor , @xmath22  bohr magneton of the electron ) .",
    "the natural length scale is set by the cyclotron or magnetic length @xmath23 , where @xmath24 = 25.65 /\\sqrt{b[t]}$ ] , which exceeds for accessible fields up to @xmath25 the lattice constant by more than a factor of 10 and justifies the application of a continuum model .    the solution of eq .",
    "( [ hnot ] ) separates in three simple energy eigenvalue problems : first , the motion in @xmath11-direction for finite extension @xmath26 with energies @xmath27 , where @xmath28 as long as there is no in - plane component of the magnetic field , second , the spin degree can be simply described by the two eigenvalues of @xmath29 , which are denoted by the majority spin direction @xmath30 for @xmath31 and the minority spin direction @xmath32 for @xmath33 as long there is no spin - orbit coupling , and third , the solution of electrons in the plane that can be reduced to a harmonic oscillator problem , whose energy scale is @xmath34 , and where @xmath35 is the cyclotron frequency .",
    "the problem becomes effectively two - dimensional if one is able to create well distinguished energy levels , so - called subbands , by requiring that the temperature @xmath36 is smaller than the energy difference @xmath37 between the first excited and the lowest subband energy , _ i.  e. _  the following inequality holds @xmath38 the estimate is based on the assumption of a rectangular quantum well of infinite height in @xmath11-direction . in order to satisfy such a condition for , say , temperatures below @xmath39 ,",
    "a width smaller than at least @xmath40 is necessary .",
    "only the advent of modern semiconductor technology made the practical realization of devices possible , where potential changes within such a short distance could be achieved . by means of appropriate doping ,",
    "it is possible to create a two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) at the semiconductor - oxide interface whose fermi energy can be controlled by a gate voltage . since the end of the seventies , technological progress made the usage of a new class of semiconductor devices for such experiments possible , _ viz . _",
    "@xmath41-@xmath42 heterostructures .",
    "they are based on the appropriate doping of stacked @xmath41 and @xmath42 layers , which form either heterojunctions in case of one interface or one and many quantum wells , respectively . in particular , the growth of heterostructures by means of molecular beam epitaxy allows a much more controlled manufacturing , which leads to a reduced number of impurities and , hence , to an increasing mobility of the samples .    assuming that the electrons occupy at sufficiently small temperatures only the lowest electronic subband , the one - particle problem neglecting the subband energy contribution has degenerate eigenvalues @xmath43 which are labeled by the orbital quantum number @xmath44 denoting the landau levels and the eigenvalue of the @xmath11-component of the spin operator , while @xmath45 determines the distance between two adjacent landau levels @xcite .",
    "note that the situation becomes different in a real 2des , since one has to account for the effective values of the mass , gyromagnetic factor , and dielectric constant of the host semiconductor .",
    "for @xmath41 , where the effective mass is @xmath46 , the gyromagnetic factor @xmath47 @xcite , and the dielectric constant @xmath48 , the energy spectrum is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ energy_levels ] .",
    "the explicit form of the eigenfunctions , belonging to the eigenvalues ( [ 2d - eigenvalues ] ) , depends on the gauge . in symmetric gauge",
    ", the energy eigenvalue problem is reduced to the solution of a two - dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator problem , and in landau gauge , it describes a free particle subject to periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath10-direction and a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator in the @xmath9-direction . in either case ,",
    "each of the landau levels is degenerate with respect to a quantum number determined by the respective gauge . for the symmetric gauge , these are the eigenvalues of the @xmath11-component of the angular momentum @xmath49 , which can be labeled for each landau level by @xmath50 , and in the landau gauge by the momenta in the y - direction @xmath51 ( @xmath52  width of a rectangle in the @xmath10-direction , @xmath53 ) . to be definite ,",
    "let us quote the eigenfunctions of the lowest orbital landau level ( lll ) @xmath54 with @xmath55 as a function of the dimensionless complex coordinate @xmath56 ( note @xmath57 ) @xmath58    the orbital degeneracy @xmath59 of each landau level counts how many elementary flux quanta @xmath60 are contained in the total flux @xmath61 through the area @xmath62 of the plane , _ i.  e. _",
    "this implies for a system of finite extension in the plane that the degeneracy of a landau level is finite too , _",
    "e.  g.  _ on a circle of radius @xmath64 , the degeneracy is @xmath65 . in case of the lll",
    ", the eigenfunction @xmath66 covers an area of @xmath67 and encloses therefore @xmath68 elementary flux quanta .",
    "in other words , the power of @xmath11 , which is also the number of zeros of the eigenfunction , equals approximately the number of flux quanta covering the area of the system .",
    "an important quantity is the filling factor @xmath69 , which is defined as the ratio of the particle number @xmath70 to the orbital degeneracy @xmath71 , _ i.  e.  _ @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the particle density .",
    "we note that the degeneracy is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field @xmath74 .",
    "this allows to accommodate an increasing number of electrons in each orbital landau levels when the magnetic field becomes stronger , or for a fixed particle number , the fermi energy is swept downwards with increasing magnetic field .",
    "if the field is so strong that at zero temperature all electrons reside in the lowest orbital landau level , we will loosely speak about the _ strong field limit _ @xcite .",
    "besides the symmetries , which are related to a specific gauge , and which are satisfied even for finite systems , there exists a continuous symmetry of the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ hnot ] ) for an infinitely extended system since the generator @xmath75 of the magnetic translation operator commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath76 , _ i.  e. _",
    "@xmath77=0 $ ] .",
    "the generator of the magnetic translation in the plane is the canonical momentum @xmath78 , and the magnetic translation operator is hence given by @xcite @xmath79    before closing , let us emphasize that such a model of independent electrons ignores at least two important ingredients , _ viz .",
    "_  disorder and interaction between the electrons , which become important when discussing the strong field limit .      in this subsection",
    "we review some of the remarkable experiments of a 2des in a strong magnetic field , which have made the physics of strong magnetic fields such a lively field of research . up to the discovery of the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) ,",
    "the physics of a 2des did not seem particularly spectacular despite the new opportunities due to the reduced dimensionality .",
    "for example , the system behaves like an ordinary fermi liquid without magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the measurement of transport properties belongs to those methods that allow the phenomenological characterization of solids .",
    "hall effect measurements serve as the experimental standard method to determine the sign and concentration of the charge carriers , and they are explained in the framework of the classical hall effect .",
    "it is evident that already at the classical level an independent electron model without disorder is insufficient to describe transport .",
    "sources of disorder in a semiconductor 2des are charged impurities , _",
    "e.  g. _ , donors , near the 2des or the roughness of the insulator - semiconductor interface in metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors ( mosfets ) . in the drude theory of the hall effect ,",
    "carriers of charge @xmath3 move in the electric field @xmath80 and cause a current density @xmath81 ( @xmath82 - conductivity tensor ) , which can be determined by inversion of the resistivity tensor @xmath83 .",
    "scattering of the charge carriers on impurities leads to elastic scattering events with elastic scattering time @xmath84 , and the drude theory gives for the components of the resistivity tensor @xmath85 @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the resistivity of the drude theory without magnetic field .",
    "such a model is often sufficient to explain experiments in fields up to @xmath88 .",
    "an unprecedented development started with the observation of the iqhe in 1980 by von klitzing when he studied the hall resistance @xmath89 and the longitudinal resistance @xmath90 of a silicon mosfet with a , at that time , comparably high mobility at temperature @xmath91 in high magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the hall resistance exhibited plateau values @xmath92 around integer filling factors @xmath93 , while the longitudinal resistance started to vanish in the middle of the plateaus showing deep dips , _ cf . _  fig .",
    "[ qhe - experiment ] .",
    "these features become most pronounced at very low temperatures , where the hall resistance exhibits a staircase like structure . simultaneously",
    ", the longitudinal resistance vanishes except for peak - like structures around @xmath94 , where the transition from one hall plateau to the next one occurs .",
    "particularly remarkable is the accuracy of the hall resistance in the plateau region , whose values are integer fractions of the von klitzing constant @xmath95 .",
    "currently , the relative standard uncertainty has a value of @xmath96 @xcite , and the iqhe serves as the metrological standard for the resistance .",
    "these results are clearly different from those of the drude theory , since the drude result for the hall resistance merely agrees with the iqhe result at those @xmath69 , where the linear @xmath97 vs.  @xmath74 curve ( [ drude ] ) crosses the staircase structure .",
    "this happens at those values for the magnetic field , where @xmath98 attains an _ integer _",
    "value , _ cf . _  fig .",
    "[ qhe - experiment ] .    when in 1982 tsui _",
    "et al . _",
    "performed the same experiment with a @xmath41-sample of higher mobility at lower temperatures in stronger fields , they found similar features in the hall and longitudinal resistance around certain fractional filling factors of the form @xmath99 with odd @xmath3 , _",
    "e.  g. _ , for @xmath100 to name the most prominent ones , see fig .",
    "[ qhe - experiment ] .",
    "hence , the name fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) was coined @xcite .    from a phenomenological viewpoint ,",
    "these quantum hall effects are quite similar , although the energy scales involved significantly differ . for the understanding of the quantum hall effects ( qhes ) it is important to note that at those @xmath69 , where the effects appear , the disorder - free system exhibits an energy gap above the ground state . in the fqhe , this is a gap above the many - particle ground state caused by the dominating electron - electron interaction , _ cf .",
    "_  sect .",
    "[ sect : polar ] , whereas in the iqhe , the gap has its origin in the energy gap between adjacent landau levels at integer filling .",
    "since the quantum - mechanical treatment of a disorder free system shows a linear @xmath74 dependence as the drude theory , a certain amount of disorder is necessary in order to create plateaus . on the other hand , sufficiently large disorder lets the qhes disappear , at first , the fqhe , at larger disorder , the iqhe too .",
    "this can be explained by the different magnitudes of the energy gaps : the energy gap in the iqhe is approximately one order of magnitude greater than that in the fqhe .",
    "hence higher mobility samples than for the iqhe are needed to observe the fqhe as larger disorder washes the energy gap out .",
    "a similar effect can be observed by increasing the temperature , which causes the disappearance of the fqhe , and at higher temperatures that of the iqhe @xcite .",
    "the theoretical explanation of the iqhe is currently based on a one - particle model with quenched disorder . in a two - dimensional system in a strong magnetic field",
    ", disorder causes the broadening of the landau levels forming a continuum of states @xcite .",
    "most of the states are localized and only those states exactly at the energy of the originally discrete landau level ( ll ) energies seem to be extended @xcite .",
    "such a system is an extensively studied example of a localization - delocalization transition in two dimensions .",
    "the formation of a mobility gap due to localized states has a similar impact on transport as a charge gap in a pure system @xcite .",
    "there are various ways to make this statement more precise .",
    "for example , using a kubo formula for the hall conductivity @xmath101 , one can show that only extended states below the fermi energy contribute @xcite .",
    "hence , increasing the chemical potential up to the center of the lll @xmath102 keeps @xmath103 .",
    "when reaching the half - filled lll , the conductivity jumps to the value @xmath104 and remains again constant up to a filling with a fermi energy at the center of the next landau level .",
    "other explanations are based on a gauge argument and the role of the edge of the system @xcite",
    ". however , we are still far from a microscopic transport theory of the iqhe @xcite that makes quantitative predictions about the influence of disorder and temperature on the conductivities . nonetheless , there is the belief that this explanation meets the essence of the effect . in the fqhe ,",
    "the energy gap is not the result of a one - particle effect but is caused by electron correlation .",
    "its origin can be traced back to the specific properties of the many - particle ground state at the so - called magic filling factors @xmath1 . in particular ,",
    "laughlin s proposal for a ground state wavefunction at @xmath105 paved the way for a deeper understanding @xcite .",
    "one of our main subjects is to explain the existence of these gaps .",
    "the importance of electron - electron interaction is supported by the experimental fact that the fqhe features become more pronounced when increasing @xmath74 , but keeping @xmath69 constant , and hence diminishing the influence of higher lls .",
    "we see that , contrary to the iqhe , even the study of the ground state and the low lying excitations of interacting electrons in strong fields is a difficult subject on its own .",
    "this is also one of the reasons why a lot of work was devoted to this issue , whereas the transport properties of the fqhe are usually explained by adopting arguments from the iqhe to the case of the fqhe @xcite .",
    "further inspection of fig .",
    "[ qhe - experiment ] shows that @xmath106 behaves around @xmath107 quite differently .",
    "this is attributed to a fermi liquid like ground state of weakly interacting particles , so - called composite fermions , at @xmath107 . in particular ,",
    "surface acoustic wave measurements gave first evidence of this effectively one - particle picture @xcite .",
    "moreover , theoretical work @xcite based on a singular gauge transformation supported such a viewpoint .",
    "a third group of experiments covers the very low filling factor region , where one expects a behavior typical for a wigner crystal pinned by disorder @xcite .",
    "various experiments in the low filling factor region indicate that physical properties change when compared with those in the fqhe region .",
    "transport experiments even at @xmath108 @xcite , _",
    "e.  g. _ , show a diverging longitudinal resistivity indicating an insulating ground state and reentrant behavior in the typical fqhe region . so far , however , an experiment giving unequivocally evidence for the existence of such a ground state is still missing @xcite .",
    "early experiments in the qhe region explored almost exclusively dynamical properties examining the response of the 2des to electromagnetic fields .",
    "this was mostly done by studying transport properties .",
    "the investigation of the thermodynamic behavior was particularly pushed by predictions on novel spin structures , although halperin had already noted very early the importance of the spin degree of freedom in @xmath41-heterostructures @xcite .",
    "the spin magnetization can be investigated , for example , by nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments @xcite , magneto - absorption experiments @xcite , and photo - luminescence measurements @xcite .",
    "transport experiments at higher lls emphasized the importance of the spin , and at @xmath109 , the only fqhe with even denominator in a one - layer system was found @xcite .",
    "recently , there were also unexpected observations in the higher landau level range .",
    "near half filling of higher lls , _",
    "e.  g. _ , at @xmath110 , anisotropies in @xmath106 were found .",
    "they are caused by ground states with a strip like density distribution , which is different from the lll behavior @xcite .    within the last ten years , further experimental information about the physics of the quantum hall regime was gathered by studying double layer systems , where two parallel quantum wells are brought close together @xcite . in such systems ,",
    "the phenomena become much richer due to the loss of symmetry of the coulomb interaction and the possible tunneling of charge carriers from one layer to the other one .",
    "hallmarks of the theoretical understanding of the qh - regime are laughlin s seminal proposal of a ground state wavefunction at @xmath105 , the introduction of the quasiparticle concept and the construction of a hierarchical theory to explain the occurrence of the fqhe at @xmath99 by halperin and haldane and jain s composite fermion approach . the construction of excited states that describe gapped density like intra landau level excitations above the laughlin state allowed the prediction of a roton - like minimum @xcite .",
    "the construction of a field - theoretical approach was initiated by the deep observation of girvin and macdonald that the application of a special singular gauge transformation to the laughlin state at @xmath111 by attaching @xmath3 flux quanta per electron leads to a bosonic state @xcite .",
    "most remarkable , the resulting bosonic wavefunction exhibits in contrast to the original fermionic laughlin state an algebraic off - diagonal long - range order ( odlro ) of the one - particle density matrix .",
    "this observation fostered attempts to search for an order parameter describing the unique laughlin state @xcite and the derivation of a phenomenological landau - ginsburg theory using the same singular gauge transformation @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can also apply the statistical transmutation in order to keep the fermionic character by attaching an even number of flux quanta , which results in a chern - simons problem of interacting electrons at integer filling factors @xcite .",
    "these attempts are guided by the desire to derive the quite successful trial ground state wavefunctions for the fqhe filling factors from first principles .",
    "furthermore , field theories open the opportunity to calculate various observables in a systematic manner .",
    "the fermionic transformation was also applied to the case of even fractions @xmath112 for integer @xmath3 by halperin _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . in this case ,",
    "attachment of @xmath113 flux quanta per electron , which point oppositely to the external magnetic field , leaves the system in average in zero magnetic field .",
    "this observation is the starting point for a reasoning that the system behaves effectively similar to a fermi liquid in a vanishing field @xcite .",
    "an attempts to get rid of some inconsistencies in these theories led recently to the development of a hamiltonian formulation theory by shankar and murthy @xcite .",
    "our discussion hitherto emphasized that in the region of filling factors , where the fqhe occurs , interaction as well as disorder are necessary ingredients of any trustworthy theoretical attempt to understand the transport properties . on the other hand ,",
    "the concomitant treatment of disorder and interaction is one of the great challenges that solid - state physics encounters .",
    "in fact , the difficulties are considerable as the example of the treatment of interaction in the problem of the metal - insulator transition in disordered solids shows @xcite .",
    "much worse , in most cases each single problem on its own is not exactly solvable .    in the fqhe regime ,",
    "the interaction is much larger than the fluctuation of the random potential since otherwise the many - particle gap above the ground state would be washed out and the effect would disappear . because of the cleanness of the samples , disorder should not play the decisive role as long as transport theories are not considered . nonetheless , disorder will quantitatively influence the results . in any case ,",
    "our starting point is an interacting model _ without _ disorder . at strong fields , moreover",
    ", an independent particle model is an inappropriate starting point at partial filling of lls due to the macroscopic ground state degeneracy .",
    "this argument does not question the usual treatment of transport in the iqhe regime , where one starts from a one - particle model with disorder neglecting just the interaction .",
    "the situation at integer filling factors is different from that at partially filled landau levels as the unperturbed ground state is non - degenerate .",
    "nevertheless , any consistent theory at integer @xmath69 has also to account for the influence of the interaction , which has the same order of magnitude as the cyclotron energy under typical experimental conditions as we will see below .",
    "there are some recent attempts to incorporate electron - electron interaction in connection with the study of the diverging localization length in the center of the lll indicating a localization - delocalization transition in a random potential @xcite .",
    "eventually , this whole discussion gets an additional interesting turn due to approaches that relate the system at a partially filled lll @xmath99 to a model of weakly interacting new composite particles at higher integer filling factor @xmath114 .",

    "this results for laughlin s qp wavefunctions ( [ qh - laughlin ] ) , ( [ qe - laughlin ] ) in a phase factor for interchange of @xmath452 @xcite indicating that the qps are @xmath453 anyons .",
    "note that the qhs of the @xmath4 state are fermions .",
    "unfortunately , this property has no direct experimental consequences .",
    "the second surprising property is the already mentioned fractional charge @xmath238 of the @xmath111 qps whose experimental detection caused some debate in conjunction with laughlin s gauge argument @xcite .",
    "the most direct evidence for this fractional charge was found recently in two different experiments . in the first one ,",
    "resonant tunneling through an anti - dot was performed , where the observed periodic conductance peaks in dependence on magnetic field and gate voltage allow to determine the charge of the quasiparticles of the @xmath0 state @xcite . in the second experiment ,",
    "non - equilibrium _ property was exploited , _ viz . _  the shot noise of the backscattered tunneling current through a constriction between two @xmath208 quantum liquids .",
    "the shot noise is proportional to the charge of the carriers and experiments showed indeed an effective charge of @xmath454 @xcite . in order to exclude the possibility that such an experiment measures rather the conductivity but not the qp charge ,",
    "a similar experiment was performed at @xmath455 . here",
    ", a qp charge of @xmath456 was found @xcite , which is in accord with the prediction that qps at @xmath99 carry charge @xmath238 .",
    "now let us turn to the incompressibility of the laughlin state .",
    "the isothermal compressibility can be either microscopically calculated as the long - wavelength limit of the density - density correlation function or from its thermodynamic definition @xmath457 at zero temperature , this can be related to the ground state energy per particle @xmath335 via @xmath458 incompressibility is therefore achieved by a discontinuity of the first derivative of the ground state energy at a certain filling factor , _ cf . _",

    "[ ground - coulomb ] in a finite particle system showed . from the comparison with ( [ eh - gap ] ) , it follows that the jump of the chemical potential is proportional to the quasiparticle gap @xmath462 therefore , the existence of a positive quasiparticle gap @xmath239 means incompressibility .",
    "in contrast to the compressible gas of non - interacting electrons _ without _ magnetic field , the situation changes for non - interacting electrons in a constant magnetic field when a landau level is filled . for arbitrary @xmath69 ,",
    "the ground state energy per particle in units of @xmath34 depends only on @xmath69 , even for a finite particle number @xcite because of @xmath463\\;(\\nu-\\frac{[\\nu]}{2 } ) + \\frac{1}{2}(\\nu - [ \\nu])\\right\\ } \\ .\\ ] ] at integer filling @xmath464 , the jump of the chemical potential , which is located in the charge gap in the middle of the two adjacent lls , becomes @xmath465 , and therefore it is @xmath466 .",

    "note that the quasiparticle gap is independent of the landau level _ and _ particle number and can also be found from the finite @xmath70 expression ( [ delta - mu ] ) .",
    "of course , the reason for the incompressibility is the existence of discrete landau levels , and this holds also when the electron s spin is taken into account .",
    "now let us return to the case of interacting electrons , where we expect also for fqhe @xmath69 incompressibility .",
    "we showed in the last subsection that this is the case at @xmath105 by extrapolating diagonalization data and trial wavefunction results to the thermodynamic limit . in the @xmath296 model at @xmath208 ,",
    "such a quasiparticle gap develops only by the non - vanishing contribution from the quasielectron energy .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ground - hard - core ] . on the other hand , this intuitive argument for a finite particle system can not replace a formal proof since the probability amplitude of this contribution remains unknown in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "( [ magn - free - nu=1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "another basic question concerning the completeness of the model was raised when the influence of the hartree term ( [ coulomb ] ) on the magnetization was studied @xcite .",
    "as we have already seen , a systematic gradient expansion of the order parameter field @xmath662 contains additional terms beyond the leading non - zero heisenberg model contribution .",
    "brey showed that the next order contribution , the hartree term , does have a non - negligible influence on the magnetization in the temperature range @xmath917 leading to an increase of the magnetization by approximately thirty per cent .",
    "this is due to the preference of a more homogeneous topological density in the hartree term suppressing spin - fluctuations .",
    "this conclusion was drawn from classical mc results , which should agree quite well in this temperature range with the quantum - mechanical result .",
    "hence some doubt is left whether the heisenberg model ( [ heisenberg ] ) can really serve as an appropriate model in such a wide temperature range .    to get immediately numerical results",

    "an analytical treatment of the heisenberg model is possible by generalizing the original model with @xmath918 symmetry in spin space to the cases of @xmath919 and @xmath920 symmetry in a schwinger boson representation .",
    "that means , when treating the general case of spin @xmath717 , _ i.  e.  _ @xmath921 , that the entries of the @xmath922 @xmath919-matrix @xmath923 are composed out of @xmath70 bosonic operators ( schwinger bosons ) .",
    "additionally , they have to satisfy the constraint @xmath924 . performing the continuum approximation leads to a cqft",
    "whose partition function is evaluated in the @xmath268 limit , which is known as the large @xmath70 mean - field theory .",
    "improvements are expected from the calculation of @xmath925-corrections for @xmath926 and @xmath927 , respectively , which are not really small . in total , this approach provides four different results , depending on the symmetry and on the accuracy of the large @xmath70 calculation .    the most accessible observable reflecting the peculiar features of this correlated electron system at @xmath4 is the spin magnetization . so far ,",
    "three methods were applied for a more or less direct measurement of this observable at @xmath4 .",

    "+ information about the spin magnetization of a 2des in an electron doped @xmath41-@xmath42 quantum well can be extracted from nmr experiments . essentially , a nucleus with spin @xmath928 and magnetic moment @xmath929 is not only zeeman coupled to the external magnetic field @xmath930 , but also to the electron s spin @xmath931 of the 2des via the hyperfine interaction , _",

    "the expectation value of the transversal part of the hyperfine interaction vanishes for an external field in @xmath11-direction .",
    "the additional magnetic field at the location of the nucleus , which is proportional to @xmath934 , causes a shift of the resonance nmr - signal with respect to the resonance in a @xmath41-sample without hyperfine coupling .",
    "this shift of the nmr - resonance , the knight shift , can be used to extract the spin magnetization of the 2des from the measured nmr - spectra @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the shift does not allow the determination of the absolute value for the spin - polarization , however , there exist often reference points . for example , the maximum knight shift at the lowest available temperature can be identified with the occurrence of saturated ferromagnetism at exactly @xmath4 .",
    "deviations from this ideal behavior appear as measurements at zero temperature are not possible , and the influence of disorder diminishing the spin - polarization is often unknown @xcite .",
    "hence , some source of uncertainty remains when evaluating experimental data .",
    "such an nmr - technique was developed and applied to the 2des in a strong magnetic field by barrett and collaborators @xcite .",
    "one of the main obstacles was to reach a sufficiently large nmr - signal from the @xmath797-nuclei .",
    "an nmr - signal enhancement of @xmath935 could be obtained by means of an optically pumped nmr - technique ( opnmr ) .",

    "the measurements were done with @xmath41-@xmath937 multiple quantum wells of width @xmath938  separated by @xmath939  wide barriers exhibiting typical electron densities of around @xmath940 for the 2des in the well and a high mobility larger than @xmath941 .",
    "the strength of the magnetic fields was between @xmath927 and @xmath942 in dependence on the investigated filling factor .",
    "initially , the lowest available temperatures were about @xmath943 , but meanwhile values smaller than @xmath944 are possible @xcite .",
    "the magneto - optical method initiated by goldberg s group @xcite utilizes the temperature dependence of the absorption coefficient @xmath945 upon shining light onto a @xmath41-heterostructure .",

    "_   @xmath949 a theoretical calculation of the @xmath950 and the determination of the factor @xmath951 , which is approximately a constant independent of the transition and temperature , yield the quantities @xmath952 and @xmath953 .",
    "these are related to the spin magnetization by @xmath954 the unknown total particle number @xmath70 in the lll can be inferred from the relation @xmath955 .",
    "the advantage of this method is the determination of the absolute value of the spin magnetization , while , on the other hand , additional theoretical calculations of the optical matrix elements are necessary .",
    "theoretical simplifications made so far comprise mainly the omission of the finite width @xmath26 and the finite barrier height of the quantum well containing the 2des , the neglect of higher orbital landau levels as well as of disorder .",
    "the first issue can be taken into account by a form factor @xmath956 leading to an effective interaction @xmath957 , which is due to the extension of the envelope wave function @xmath133 in @xmath11-direction instead of a delta - function for zero width .",
    "assuming an infinite barrier well height and a symmetric charge distribution @xmath958 as in barrett s experiment @xcite , we obtain for the form factor @xmath959 altering the short - range behavior for @xmath960 . in the phenomenological field - theory ,",
    "the spin - stiffness @xmath667 becomes @xmath961 for a typical width of @xmath962 and fields of @xmath963 as in barrett s experiment , the width in units of the cyclotron length is @xmath964 .",
    "the spin - stiffness becomes then approximately half of its zero - width value @xcite and causes a considerable decrease of the energy scale .    since the ratio of landau level distance and interaction energy scales with the square root of @xmath74 , see ( [ scales ] ) , the correction due to higher landau levels depends on the magnitude of the magnetic field used in experiment . in barrett s experiment , there is @xmath965 , which is not really much smaller than one as it should be .",
    "in fact , allowing arbitrary values for the magnetic field , but still keeping @xmath4 , the task becomes much more complicated as even saturated ferromagnetism can not be simply assumed , _ cf . _  an example at @xmath561 with a first - order phase transition from paramagnetism to ferromagnetism upon lowering the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the monte carlo results @xcite for the one - spin flip gap indicate a considerable decrease in the @xmath724-limit of the spin - wave dispersion .",
    "nevertheless , it remains difficult to estimate the quantitative influence of a renormalized dispersion relation on the temperature dependent magnetization . in any case",
    ", the magnetization should be diminished due to the consideration of ll mixing .",
    "the largest uncertainty arises from the influence of disorder .",
    "almost all theories aiming at the calculation of thermodynamic properties neglect it . in spite of the high - mobility of the samples ,",
    "disorder occurs , which leads in general to a broadening of the landau levels .",
    "this can be taken into account in a crude approximation by the self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) resulting in the somewhat unphysical semi - elliptical broadening of the one - particle density of states @xcite .",
    "similarly , the many - particle gap of the fqhe is reduced , what was quantitatively shown for short - range impurities at @xmath208 @xcite , as well as the disappearance of the fqhe when decreasing the mobility of the samples below a certain value @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , disorder should decrease the magnetization of the ground state due to reversed spins in regions of strong potential fluctuations .",
    "comparison of theoretical and experimental results is for many reasons not easy .",
    "simplifications and approximations in theory as well as non - unique experimental conditions influence the results .",
    "nevertheless , the 2des in the qh - regime offers outstanding conditions for comparison of theory with experiment in a highly - correlated system .",
    "therefore , let us quickly compare various theoretical and experimental magnetization results , which are depicted in figs .",
    "[ magn_comparison ] and [ magn_exp ] , for a more thorough discussion , see @xcite .",
    "our comparison with experiment is mainly based on barrett s data , while results from magneto - absorption experiments are only shown in fig .",
    "[ magn_exp ] .",
    "the shf and the free particle results serve as upper and lower bound for any magnetization data .",
    "barrett s nmr data are in between these two curves except for temperatures below @xmath966 , where they seem to be too high , and for @xmath967 , where they even fall below the free particle curve .",
    "a possible explanation for the former behavior is the measurement at @xmath968 instead of @xmath4 as well as disorder preventing full polarization at zero temperature and therefore keeping the curve smoother when approaching zero temperature .",
    "not surprisingly , goldberg s data whose technique allows the determination of the absolute value of the relative spin - polarization are smaller in this temperature range , see fig .",
    "[ magn_exp ] .",
    "comparison of the numerical data from the mc calculation and the exact diagonalization results on the sphere for nine particles assuming a finite width gives additional important information .",
    "the mc data are always larger than the diagonalization data .",
    "while this has to be true at larger temperatures due to the omission of the itinerant character of the electrons in the heisenberg model , the discrepancy at lower temperatures is mainly due to the strong finite - size corrections of the diagonalization data at small @xmath648 .",
    "the temperature , at which these finite - size corrections become important , can be estimated from numerical results for the susceptibility on the sphere @xcite .",
    "therefore , the mc data seem to be more trustworthy at low temperatures .",
    "the results of the cqft partially differ in dependence on the approximation used . at low temperatures ,",
    "the @xmath919 mean - field theory is most appropriate as the free magnon scenario ( [ magn - magnons ] ) can be recovered . except for tiny deviations , this is also true for the @xmath919-theory with @xmath925-corrections . at temperatures above @xmath904 ,",
    "the curves start to diverge .",
    "the mean - field curve is above the mc data while the @xmath925-correction curve drops so strongly that it becomes negative similar to the result of a free magnon theory of fig .",
    "[ magn_magnons ] . on the other hand , the @xmath920 results do not yield the correct free magnon behavior , but agree well with the mc data . here , the @xmath925-corrections represent a notable improvement over the mean - field @xmath920-theory . in spite of doubts regarding the completeness of the model ,",
    "the results are impressive for the experimental value of @xmath559 .",
    "these findings within the cqft corroborate the picture that the collective behavior dominates in the considered temperature range for @xmath969 .",
    "such an interpretation gets further support when comparing the dispersion curves for the qhfm and the heisenberg model , which start to diverge in a system of finite width only at one - spin flip excitation energies that correspond to temperatures of more than @xmath970 , _ cf . _  fig .",
    "[ disp ] .    among the many - particle approaches ,",
    "our theory is evidently an essential improvement over the shf - theory .",
    "the correct low- and high - temperature behaviors are additional pleasing features .",
    "moreover , the discussion of the low - temperature excitations showed that in the case of vanishing zeeman term the spin - wave excitations suppress any spontaneous magnetization at temperatures larger zero . on the other hand ,",
    "the deviations from experiment are still large at moderate temperatures despite improvement when accounting for the finite width of the quantum well .",
    "the theory of haussmann suggests that at higher temperatures screening plays an important role . in fig .",
    "[ magn_comparison ] , two curves with different screening wavevectors @xmath971 and @xmath972 are shown .",
    "they correspond to those two temperatures @xmath973 and @xmath974 , respectively , that we found from the self - consistent determination within the rpa - calculation , _ cf . _  eq .  ( [ scr5 ] )",
    ". therefore , we expect the curve with the correct temperature dependence to interpolate between the two curves in the temperature range between @xmath975 and @xmath976 .    within our diagrammatic approach",
    ", skyrmions can not be taken into account , but their influence on the spin magnetization is presumably not very strong .",
    "although skyrmion - antiskyrmion neutral excitations are more effective in decreasing the magnetization due to the larger number of flipped spins , their thermodynamic weight is rather small because of their comparably large energies .",
    "moreover , the experimental zeeman term value @xmath799 lets dramatically shrink the energetic preference for these excitations over the neutral quasielectron - quasihole excitations .",
    "the knowledge of the spectral function allows also comparison with other experimental observables at filling factor one .",
    "for example , the filling factor dependence of the spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath977 , which was systematically studied at temperature @xmath978 @xcite shows a deep dip at @xmath4 due to the lack of low - lying excitations in contrast to those existing above the ground state of a skyrme crystal .",
    "unfortunately , only single values for the temperature dependence of @xmath977 at exactly @xmath4 are available @xcite . on the basis of a korringa theory of nuclear magnetic resonance in metals @xcite employing an approximation without vertex corrections",
    "we predict a gaussian like maximum in the temperature dependence of the relaxation rate @xcite .",
    "the rate was also discussed in the framework of the cqft @xcite . +",
    "a traditional method to measure spectral functions is tunneling @xcite . in our case",
    ", a current can flow between two parallel 2des layers in a magnetic field when a voltage @xmath979 between the layers is applied . in the case of two weakly coupled layers ,",
    "the current can be expressed as the convolution of the energy dependent spectral functions .",
    "we predict pronounced peaks in the @xmath980-@xmath979-characteristic if the voltage @xmath979 equals the temperature dependent difference of the quasiparticle peaks , _",
    "i.  e. _  , @xmath981 @xcite .",
    "although tunneling experiments were performed in the range @xmath982 for spin - polarized electrons @xcite , experimental data at filling factor one are not available to date .",
    "this paper is concerned with the physics of interacting electrons in two - dimensions in a strong magnetic field neglecting the influence of disorder .",
    "such systems can be realized in certain semiconductor structures of sufficiently high mobility , where the electrons form a 2des .",
    "the electronic degrees of freedom can be well observed at low temperatures .",
    "there are some unique properties of such a 2des . among them",
    "are : the position of the chemical potential can be tuned , the band structure of a clean sample in a magnetic field is exactly known , and the coupling of the electron s spin to an external magnetic field can be changed .",
    "these properties allow a much easier comparison of theory with experiment than in other strongly correlated systems . in the strong magnetic field limit , however , we encounter the common problem that any naive perturbation theory fails .",
    "this fact as well as the many unpredicted experimental observations in the quantum hall regime have been a challenge to theory for more than twenty years .",
    "our theoretical treatment is restricted to the physics of the lowest orbital landau level based on a microscopic electronic hamiltonian .",
    "first , we study the extreme case of an infinitely strong magnetic field , where the physics is solely determined by interacting spinless electrons .",
    "although this case is rather artificial , it provides important information , which can explain the incompressibility of the many - particle ground state at certain filling factors .",
    "this is a necessary ingredient for the understanding of the fractional quantum hall effect . in particular , we investigate the properties and quality of various quasiparticle trial wavefunctions .",
    "the inclusion of the spin degree of freedom is essential at and near filling factor one .",
    "we show that at @xmath4 the ground state exhibits saturated ferromagnetism , even in the absence of a symmetry breaking field , while novel spin - structures appear near @xmath4 if the effective gyromagnetic factor @xmath559 is small enough .",
    "the thermodynamics of such a quantum hall ferromagnet is studied at exactly filling factor @xmath4 in the framework of a many - particle theory emphasizing the role of spin - wave excitations and screening .",
    "we investigate the temperature dependence of the spin magnetization in the presence of a small zeeman term and compare with other theoretical approaches and with experimental data .",
    "although predictions of future research are rather limited as many of the unprecedented experimental observations show , let us shortly speculate , what will be of particular theoretical interest in the next time .",
    "so far , we know quite a lot about the physics at single filling factors , where experimental effects are most pronounced . on the other hand , there remain large regions along the filling factor line , where much less is known .",
    "incompressible , compressible metallic - like and insulating ground states are known at certain filling factors , but the transition between them is hardly understood .",
    "support from the experimental side is rather restricted due to the occurrence of disorder .",
    "thus , the consideration of disorder is an interesting and promising field .",
    "unfortunately , quantitative control of disorder in experiment is limited . moreover",
    ", such investigations could also diminish the gap between the rather loosely connected fields of interacting electrons in a magnetic field and non - interacting electrons in a random potential .",
    "another interesting field seems to be the systematic study of higher landau levels .",
    "recent experiments suggest that some of the spectacular effects of the lowest orbital landau level disappear when the electrons reside in higher landau levels .",
    "nevertheless , our knowledge about this region is rather sparse . in all",
    ", the study of the transition from the high - field region down to the low - field region is still almost unexplored .    in closing ,",
    "the two - dimensional electron system in a strong magnetic field exhibits a lot of different physical phases , and an astonishing number of theoretical concepts finds their application . in view of the progress of the last twenty years and the number of unsolved questions , future experiments and theories",
    "will certainly deepen and enlarge our current understanding .",
    "it is worth to remark that except for corrections due to quantum electrodynamical effects , the zeeman splitting energy @xmath648 equals the distance between adjacent landau levels @xmath45 in vacuum .",
    "this leads to the same energy for particles in landau level @xmath141 and minority spin @xmath32 and in the adjacent landau level @xmath983 and majority spin @xmath30 .",
    "however , this relation breaks down in a semiconductor environment as we will see below .      in this work",
    ", we use the term strong magnetic field and quantum hall regime as synonyms , although the second notion is more precise .",
    "it indicates that transport measurements show at low filling factors the typical features of the quantum hall effects .",
    "this can be accomplished , at least in principle , even at moderate magnetic fields , but at sufficiently small particle density @xmath141 .",
    "on the other hand , it implies a sufficiently clean sample .",
    "the magnetic translation remains so long a symmetry as the magnetic field is homogeneous , or the vector potential is linear in @xmath984 .",
