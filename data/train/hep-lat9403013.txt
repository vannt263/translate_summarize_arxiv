    "a possible mechanism of colour confinement in quantum chromo - dynamics ( _ qcd _ ) is dual superconductivity of the vacuum  @xcite .    according to this scenario",
    ", the chromoelectric field is channelled into abrisokov flux tubes  @xcite , in the same way as the ordinary magnetic field is in superconductors : the word _",
    "dual _ indicates the interchange of roles between electric and magnetic fields and charges .",
    "the chromoelectric field mediating the force between coloured particles is squeezed by meissner effect into flux tubes of constant energy per unit length , giving rise to the confining linear potential .",
    "these flux tubes behave as strings  @xcite .",
    "the existence of strings in hadronic physics is supported by phenomenology @xcite .",
    "they have also been visualized by numerical simulations of qcd on the lattice  @xcite .",
    "some evidence in favour of dual superconductivity of the vacuum has been produced by montecarlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "however a clear cut test of the mechanism is still missing .",
    "such a test would be the detection of monopole condensation in the ground state , analogous to the condensation of cooper pairs in the ground state of an ordinary superconductor .",
    "condensation implies that the vacuum is a superposition of states with different charge , which , in turn , is nothing but a spontaneous breaking of the @xmath0 symmetry related to charge conservation  @xcite .",
    "such a breaking is signaled by a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value ( _ vev _ ) of any operator carrying non - trivial charge , as , e.g. the scalar field of the landau - ginzburg model of superconductivity . that _",
    "vev _ is called a disorder parameter in the language of statistical mechanics .    in this paper",
    ", we give an explicit form of the creation operator of monopoles , together with a lattice version of it , in view of using its _ vev _ as a disorder parameter monitoring dual superconductivity .",
    "the operator is checked in @xmath0 compact pure gauge theory on a lattice , where the behaviour of monopoles is known  @xcite .",
    "for _ qcd _ , the strategy is the following .",
    "the monopoles which are expected to condense and generate superconductivity are dirac monopoles of a residual @xmath0 symmetry , which survives after a suitable gauge fixing , known as abelian projection  @xcite .",
    "an abelian projection is defined as the gauge transformation which diagonalizes any operator transforming in the adjoint representation of the gauge group .",
    "the points where two eigenvalues of that operator coincide correspond to singularities of the gauge transformation and have the topology of world - lines of point monopoles  @xcite .",
    "such monopoles have been observed on the lattice  @xcite .",
    "of course the location and the number of monopoles do depend on the choice of the operator used to define the abelian projection : a possibility , advocated by t  hooft , is that physics , i.e. monopole condensation , is independent of it .",
    "the relevant abelian degrees of freedom can also be fixed by a somewhat different procedure , known as _",
    "maximal abelian _",
    "projection  @xcite .",
    "our operator will allow to investigate unambigously what abelian projection , if any , defines the monopoles relevant to confinement .    in this paper",
    ", we will only present the construction of the operator and the way it works in lattice @xmath0 compact gauge theory .",
    "for that theory , there exists a construction of a disorder variable describing monopole condensation  @xcite , which is rigorous but based on a particular form of the action ( the villain action ) .",
    "our operator coincides with the above one in the villain case , but can be used with different forms of the action .",
    "this is particularly important in order to use it for non - abelian theories , where the effective @xmath0 action after abelian projection is not known .",
    "the study of monopole condensation in _ qcd _  is in progress and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "for the sake of definiteness , we shall consider here only the case of a @xmath0 monopole .",
    "our procedure can easily be generalized to all kind of solitons .",
    "let @xmath1 be the classical field produced in the location @xmath2 by a dirac monopole at rest in @xmath3 .",
    "we can make any choice for the gauge , e.g. by putting the string along the positive @xmath4-axis .",
    "then , defining @xmath5 and @xmath6 , we have : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the charge of the monopole , satisfying the dirac quantization condition : @xmath9    if @xmath10 is the conjugate momentum to @xmath11 , then the operator @xmath12 creates a monopole at the location @xmath3 and time @xmath13 .",
    "this can be immediately seen in the schrdinger representation of the fields , where we have : @xmath14 ) is a trivial consequence of the canonical commutation relations between the fields and their conjugate momenta , and is nothing but the field - theoretic equivalent of the familiar statement that @xmath15 translates the coordinate @xmath16 by @xmath17 : @xmath18 @xmath19 , applied to any field configuration , adds a monopole to it .",
    "this can be restated in terms of commutation relations as : @xmath20 & = & b_{i}(x , y ) \\mu(\\bf{y } , t)\\\\ \\left[\\pi_{i}({\\bf x } , t ) , \\mu({\\bf y } , t)\\right ] & = & 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which also show that the electric field of the configuration is left unchanged .",
    "it is worthwhile to notice that the specific choice of the gauge for @xmath21 is irrelevant : what really matters here is topology , which is independent of it . our operator @xmath22 is similar to operators introduced in the literature by different constructions , in various contexts @xcite .",
    "now , if the ground state of the theory has a definite monopole number @xmath23 , then , under a magnetic @xmath0 rotation , we have : @xmath24 hence : @xmath25 which implies : @xmath26 therefore if @xmath27 then @xmath28 is not @xmath0 invariant and there is spontaneous symmetry breaking of @xmath0 .",
    "a translation by a static field @xmath29 such that @xmath30 in this language corresponds to a pure gauge transformation : @xmath31",
    "@xmath32    it is clear that @xmath33 does not change @xmath34 and , since @xmath35 , it does not change @xmath36 either .",
    "therefore , by gauge - invariance , @xmath37    performing the wick rotation to euclidean space , we obtain : @xmath38 from now on , we will be interested only in the euclidean quantity and drop for simplicity the @xmath39 subscript .    for free photons , rescaling the fields by a factor @xmath40 with @xmath41 , @xmath42 \\right\\ } } { { \\displaystyle \\int } { \\cal d}a \\exp \\left\\ { -\\beta { \\displaystyle \\int } \\left [ \\frac{1}{4 } f_{\\mu\\nu } f_{\\mu\\nu}\\right ] \\right\\}}\\ ] ] the integral is gaussian and can be directly computed giving : @xmath43 since @xmath44 if @xmath21 is such that @xmath45 , we have @xmath46 the same calculation for a pure gauge transformation yields : @xmath47 we realize that the first term in the exponent of eq.([defmu ] ) is a normalization which can be subtracted by taking instead of @xmath48 the ratio : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is defined by means of any gauge transformation @xmath51 , such that : @xmath52 then @xmath53 the integral in the exponent , once regularized at small distances , tends to @xmath54 as @xmath55 . in the infinite volume limit @xmath56 as it should be , since the perturbative vacuum has zero magnetic charge .",
    "the same situation appears when computing the overlap of the fock vacuum to the bogolubov rotated vacuum in a superconductor  @xcite .",
    "the same result is obtained if we work directly in the schrdinger representation in the coulomb gauge . there",
    "the vacuum wave functional is : @xmath57 and @xmath58 lattice formulation -------------------    a lattice version of the operator @xmath22 is obtained by replacing @xmath59 by the plaquette @xmath60 , or better , by its imaginary part : @xmath61 and discretizing the field @xmath62 .",
    "then the disorder parameter becomes : @xmath63 or , if we want to cancel the unwanted normalization , we can divide by : @xmath64 obtaining @xmath65 we stress once again that any gauge function @xmath66 is acceptable , provided the normalization condition ( [ eq : norm ] ) is satisfied .",
    "if we blindly compute @xmath48 or @xmath67 by numerical simulations , a first technical difficulty arises .",
    "we are faced with the usual problems encountered in computing quantities like a partition function , which are exponentials of extensive quantities , proportional to the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the distribution of the values is not gaussian and the error does not decrease by increasing statistics ( see , e.g.  @xcite , where the same problem appears in a different context ) . to avoid that , we will compute the quantity : @xmath68 at @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and therefore : @xmath71 we easily get , putting @xmath72 the following expression for @xmath73 : @xmath74 which can be evaluated by numerical simulations .",
    "the subscript on the average indicates the action defining the feynman integral .",
    "the two quantities on the _ rhs _ have the same strong coupling expansion .",
    "thus , the use of @xmath75 instead of @xmath76 , besides producing a cancellation of the spurious normalization of the feynman path integral , can help in eliminating the lattice artefacts produced by the discretization which can spoil the continuum limit .",
    "this brings us to a second , more physical difficulty , which is the continuum limit .",
    "in fact , while for _ qcd _ , which is asymptotically free , we expect that , at sufficiently high @xmath77 , lattice artefacts should cancel , for a model like @xmath0 this point is not so clear in principle . in ref .",
    "@xcite a proof is given of monopole condensation in the confined phase of @xmath0 , defining a disorder variable for the villain action .",
    "we have checked that our @xmath48 operator exactly coincides with the one of ref .",
    "@xcite , when we use the villain action : we expect that for wilson action the same will hold .",
    "we have then computed numerically @xmath73 .    for a _ good",
    "_ order parameter , we would expect @xmath73 to be zero , or @xmath78 below the critical value of the coupling @xmath79 and then to show a large negative peak around @xmath79 , corresponding to a drop to zero of @xmath75 . at larger values of @xmath77",
    ", we have free photons and eq .",
    "( [ eq : pert ] ) should hold .",
    "figure  1 shows the behaviour of @xmath73 for a @xmath80 lattice , for a monopole in the center of the space lattice . in order to be able to identify the signal as a genuine physical result ( i.e. not due to lattice artefacts )",
    ", we have performed a number of checks :    * we have changed the form of @xmath62 by a gauge transformation to get the wu - yang expression of the monopole potential .",
    "the result does not change qualitatively .",
    "* @xmath50 shows practically no signal at @xmath79 within the errors , and does not change appreciably by changes of @xmath81 . to test that we have computed @xmath82 for two different choices of @xmath83 , both satisfying the condition eq.([eq : norm ] ) : @xmath84 for @xmath85 and @xmath86 for @xmath87 .",
    "in fig.2 we display @xmath88 and @xmath89 for a @xmath90 lattice .",
    "@xmath91 shows no relevant signal at @xmath79 .",
    "* we have measured the correlation function between a monopole antimonopole pair at large time distance , in the same position in space . to do that we define @xmath92 @xmath93 and we measure @xmath94 since @xmath95 by the cluster property we should have at large @xmath96 that @xmath97 , or @xmath98 .",
    "fig.3 shows that this expectation is indeed verified .",
    "we notice that the height of the negative peak of @xmath73 at @xmath79 increases with volume [ see fig.1 and fig.2 ] .",
    "the value of @xmath79 as defined by the position of our peak is @xmath99 for a @xmath90 lattice and @xmath100 for a @xmath80 lattice .",
    "we have taken monopole charge @xmath101 ( eq.([defcarica ] ) ) to get a good signal with a relatively low statistics ( tipically @xmath102 configurations per value of @xmath77 ) : smaller charges ( @xmath103 ) give the same results but the signals are smaller and more noisy .",
    "our statistical errors are shown in the figures , when they are larger than the symbols used .",
    "the strong negative peak in @xmath73 at @xmath79 is a clear signal that monopoles are condensed in the confined phase , while they are not in the high-@xmath77 regime of the @xmath0 model .",
    "the same signal can be extracted from @xmath104 correlators .",
    "we expect a similar signal in _ qcd _  at the deconfining phase transition for the disorder variable creating @xmath0 monopoles defined by abelian projection .",
    "work is in progress and a comprehensive report will appear soon .",
    "we underline that the technique used is exactly the same as for the @xmath0 and that it can be extended straightforwardly to different systems in which the condensation of solitons can play a physical role , like the 3-d @xmath105 model , or the 4-d georgi - glashow model .",
    "work is in progress also on these systems .",
