    "probing into cp violation in the lepton sector is one of the most challenging goals in particle physics .",
    "long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments are the prime candidates for observational means for detecting such effect .",
    "however , it has been known since sometime ago that the earth matter effect acts as a contamination to the measurement of genuine cp violating effects due to the leptonic kobayashi - maskawa phase in such experiments @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is of crucial importance to achieve a complete understanding of the features of interplay between the genuine cp and the matter effects to have a realistic design of experiments for measuring the cp violating phase .",
    "we describe in this article a new powerful tool which we call  cp trajectory diagram in bi - probability space \" @xcite .",
    "it enables us to represent pictorially the three effects , the effects of ( a ) genuine cp violation due to the @xmath2 term , ( b ) cp conserving @xmath3 term , and ( c ) fake cp violation due to earth matter , separately in a single diagram . by using the cp trajectory diagram",
    "we observe that there is a two - fold ambiguity in the determination of @xmath0 which is related with the sign of @xmath1 . as described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , this is a remnant of the approximate degeneracy in the vacuum oscillation probability under the transformations ( @xmath4 ) and ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "we then discuss principles of tuning beam energy for a given baseline distance to resolve the ambiguity , and to maximize the cp - violating effect . finally , we point out that the ambiguity may be resolved with 50 % chance in the super - jhf experiment @xcite with a megaton class water cherenkov detector .",
    "it is quite contrary to the conventional belief that the sign of @xmath1 can not be determined with such a short baseline as @xmath6 km . in a companion article , which is a report for the proceedings of taup2001 @xcite",
    ", we discuss further physical implications of our results .",
    "in particular , we explore the possibility of an _ in situ _ simultaneous measurement of @xmath0 and the sign of @xmath1 in a single experiment .",
    "we now introduce the cp trajectory diagram in bi - probability space spanned by @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "suppose that we compute the oscillation probability @xmath9 and @xmath10 with a given set of oscillation and experimental parameters .",
    "then , we draw a dot on the two - dimensional plane spanned by @xmath9 and @xmath10 . when @xmath0 is varied we have a set of dots which forms a closed trajectory , closed because the probability must be a periodic function of @xmath0 , a phase variable .    in fig",
    "1 plotted is the contours of oscillation probabilities @xmath9 and @xmath10 which is drawn by varying the cp violating phase @xmath0 from 0 to @xmath11 .",
    "they are averaged over the gaussian neutrino energy distribution with peak energy of 500 mev and width 100 mev .",
    "as you might have guessed , these diagrams are elliptic .",
    "it is so exactly in vacuum and in a good approximation even in matter at relatively short baseline and as far as the mass hierarchy @xmath12 is the case @xcite .",
    "what does cp trajectory diagram actually represent ?",
    "there is a very simple answer to this question .",
    "the lengths of major and minor axes represent the coefficients of cp violating @xmath13 and cp conserving @xmath14 terms , respectively , in the neutrino oscillation probability @xmath15 . whereas the distance between two ( positive and negative @xmath1 ) ellipses",
    "gives the size of the matter effect .",
    "the last point can be explicitly verified by running the same calculation with twice larger matter effects , as done in ref .",
    "therefore , you can see the size of these three terms just by eye when it was projected onto the cp trajectory diagram .    0.3 cm    -2.0 cm fig .",
    "1 : cp trajectory in the bi - probability ( given in % ) plane for the baseline @xmath16 km and energy @xmath17 mev . as indicated in the figures , the solid and the dashed lines are for @xmath18 and @xmath19 cases , respectively , and the dotted and the dash - dotted lines correspond to the same signs of @xmath1 as above but with matter effect switched off .",
    "the mixing parameters are fixed as @xmath20 ev@xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ev@xmath21 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "we take @xmath26 g/@xmath27 where @xmath28 is the matter density and @xmath29 is the electron fraction . 0.5",
    "cm it is obvious from fig .",
    "1 that the approximate degeneracy ( @xmath4 ) and ( @xmath5 ) which exists in the vacuum case is lifted by the matter effect ; matter helps !",
    "however , it is also clearly seen in fig .",
    "1 that there are remaining degeneracies if the sign of @xmath1 is not known _",
    "a priori_.    the above discussion assumes that the value of @xmath30 is known prior to the experiment .",
    "if the value is not known in advance there is an another ambiguity , the ( @xmath31 ) ambiguity , as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "therefore , there exits a combined ambiguity , ( @xmath0 @xmath32 sign of @xmath1 ) times ( @xmath31 ) , which in the worst case can be 4-fold . the ambiguity was referred to as the `` clover - leaf ambiguity '' in taup2001 @xcite .",
    "if one wants to resolve the two - fold ambiguity ( @xmath0 @xmath32 sign of @xmath1 ) in a single experiment one can not tune the experimental parameters so that the @xmath13 term is maximal because then the trajectory shrinks to a straight line , closing the possibility of resolution of the ambiguity . then , there should be a compromise .",
    "first , one can obtain the conditions to maximize lengths of major and minor axes , which lead to @xcite @xmath33 it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that one can compromize these two requirements in the energy region of 0.5 to 2 gev .",
    "we now address our final subject , probably the most important one , the possibility of simultaneous determination of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the super - jhf experiment .",
    "we assume that @xmath30 is known in a reasonable accuracy prior to this experiment . in fig .",
    "2 plotted is the cp trajectory diagram in the number of appearance events plane for @xmath34 and @xmath35 channels .",
    "we assume a water cherenkov detector of fiducial volume 0.9 mton , and 4 mw of proton beam power which is planned in the jhf experiment in its phase ii @xcite .",
    "we use the off - axis ( oa ) 3 degree beam whose neutrino energy peaks at @xmath36 gev .",
    "we refer ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed explanation of how the computation of number of events is done and the results for alternative choice of beams .",
    "one can clearly see from fig .",
    "2 that at least a half of the parameter space fulfilling the condition @xmath37 does not suffer from the ambiguity problem . then ,",
    "with the 50 % chance ( thanks to nature s kind setting ! ) they will be able to determine the cp violating angle @xmath0 and the sign of @xmath1 simultaneously in the super - jhf experiment .",
