    "recently , thermodynamics of quantum integrable spin chains related to lie superalgebras received much attentions . in particular , several people @xcite studied thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) equations @xcite related to @xmath3 . on the other hand , study on @xmath4 case",
    "has begun only recently in refs .",

    "@xcite ) , in which we deal with the simplest @xmath0 model @xcite .",
    "namely , we have derived the @xmath5-system from the @xmath0 version of the @xmath2-system @xcite , and transformed it into the tba equation and excited state tba equation from the point of view of the quantum transfer matrix ( qtm ) method @xcite . as for the largest eigenvalue sector of the dressed vacuum form ( dvf ) , this tba equation coincides with the one @xcite from the traditional string hypothesis @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the excited state tba equation from the second largest eigenvalue sector , which characterizes the correlation length , is difficult to derive by the string hypothesis .",
    "the purpose of this paper is applications of our previous results @xcite to the calculation of physical quantities .",
    "the hamiltonian @xcite of the @xmath0 integrable spin chain , which we deal with in this paper is given by @xmath6 where we assume the periodic boundary condition .",
    "for precise definition of ( [ hami ] ) , see refs .",

    ", we consider the case @xmath7 , which corresponds to the antiferromagnetic regime . in section 2 ,",
    "we consider the finite temperature correction of the dvf @xmath8 from the @xmath2-system @xcite and calculate the central charge from the low temperature asymptotics of the specific heat ( see , refs .",
    "the central charge is expressed in terms of the rogers dilogarithm function , and reproduces the conjecture @xcite @xmath9 from the root density method .",
    "moreover we solve the tba equation numerically and evaluate the thermodynamic quantities such as the free energy , the internal energy , the specific heat and the entropy , which are depicted in fig .",

    "we comment on the excited state tba equations , which have singularities from zeros of fused qtms . for comparison",

    "in our previous papers @xcite , we proposed the tba equation of the @xmath0 model @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( @xmath2 : temperature ; in this paper , we set the boltzmann constant to @xmath1 . ) , @xmath14 is the kernel defined by @xmath15 and @xmath16 denotes the convolution @xmath17 through this tba equation , the logarithm of the largest eigenvalue of the qtm @xmath18 ( see , ref.@xcite for the definition of @xmath19 . )",

    "after some manipulation , one can rewrite ( [ tba ] ) as @xmath27 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "we introduce the scaling function in the low temperature limit @xmath28 from the modified tba equation ( [ tba - modi ] ) , we find that @xmath29 satisfies the following non - linear integral equation @xmath30 where @xmath11 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 we shall divide @xmath8 into the ground state and the finite temperature correction parts , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively , @xmath35 by using the functions ( [ y - limit ] ) , one can derive the asymptotic behavior of the finite temperature correction part for large @xmath36 : @xmath37 taking account of the relation @xmath38 , we can derive the following relation from ( [ tba - limit ] ) : @xmath39 where we assume that @xmath29 are non - decreasing functions on @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the rogers dilogarithm function @xmath42 substituting ( [ tba - sum ] ) into ( [ kitarou ] ) , we obtain @xmath43 + o(\\frac{1}{\\beta}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in our case , both @xmath44 and @xmath45 behave in the same manner , thus we set @xmath46 . for small @xmath2 , the leading term of the specific heat @xmath47 @xmath48 is proportional @xcite to the central charge c : @xmath49 where the fermi velocity is @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "thus , we can express the central charge as @xmath51 above expression is widely seen in the model related to rank one algebras ( see for example , refs .",

    "this agrees with the conjecture @xcite by the root density method .",
    "now we shall solve the tba equation ( [ tba - modi ] ) numerically to analyze the thermodynamic quantities at finite temperatures . to analyze this equation ( [ tba - modi ] ) numerically",

    ", our numerical study for finite @xmath75 indicates that the distribution pattern of the roots of the bae may vary with temperature .",
