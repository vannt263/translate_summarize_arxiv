    "lying in the centers of galaxies , supermassive black holes grow by accreting matter that falls within their gravitational potential . such active galactic nuclei ( agn ) can be identified by signatures in their optical spectra , such as broad and/or narrow high ionization emission lines , that reveal the presence of a very deep gravitational potential or a non - stellar ionizing continuum .",
    "spectral emission lines from gas deep within the potential well of the black hole are doppler broadened , giving rise to the broad line region ( blr ) , while the narrow line region ( nlr ) gas , though primarily ionized by the agn continuum , extends hundreds of parsecs beyond the accretion disk .",
    "type 1 agn are those systems showing both broad ( full - width half - max , fwhm , @xmath31000s km s@xmath4 ) and narrow ( fwhm @xmath3 100s km s@xmath4 ) emission lines in their optical spectra ; type 2 agn lack broad lines .",
    "intermediate agn types exist , including types 1.8 and 1.9 , classified by a weak , or absent , broad h@xmath5 line while retaining a broad component to h@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the simplest agn unification models attribute differences in agn type to the viewing angle towards an axisymmetric , parsec scale obscurer , which can block our direct view of the agn central engine @xcite . but what happens when multiple agn types are seen in the same source at different epochs ?",
    "such systems are rare but not unheard of .",
    "variable x - ray absorption has been observed in what have been dubbed `` changing - look '' agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; these variations result from gas clouds moving into and out of the line - of - sight .",
    "perhaps more striking are the agn that have optically transitioned from a pure type 1 state to a type 1.8 - 2.0 , or vice versa , with the dramatic appearance or disappearance of a strong h@xmath5 component . within the past 40 years",
    ", such changes have been detected in only a handful of agn , including mrk 590 @xcite , ngc 2617 @xcite , ngc 7603 @xcite , mrk 1018 @xcite , ngc 1097 @xcite , ngc 3065 @xcite and ngc 7582 @xcite .",
    "these types of changes might also be explained via variable absorption : in models where the obscuring material has a patchy distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the dynamical movement of dust clouds could , in principle , result in a change of classification .",
    "it has also been argued that changes in type are expected with variations in accretion rate @xcite or transient events ( e.g. , the tidal disruption of a star by a black hole ; * ? ? ?",

    "below we discuss our analysis of the optical spectra in tandem with archival x - ray spectra and optical photometry . as we elaborate in  [ discussion ] , these independent lines of observational evidence taken together paint a compelling picture that variable absorption can not be the driver of the observed state change .",
    "rather , the quasar continuum faded , providing less power to ionize the gas in the blr .",

    "( b ) the time lag of the response of the optical line complex is 2 - 3 times longer than the lag of the h@xmath5 line @xcite and this -emitting gas is also a source of balmer lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the observed flux diminution and disappearance of the broad h@xmath5 and ( most of the ) h@xmath1 lines can result from either variable absorption blocking the line - of - sight to the broad - line , but not the narrow - line , region , or a change in the agn continuum ionizing the blr . to test the first possibility , we applied reddening to the agn model components from the 2000 sdss spectrum ( continuum and broad lines ) to determine if we can reproduce the observed 2010 boss spectrum .",

    "the above equation was derived by assuming that the orbiting object is on a circular , keplerian orbit around the black hole and by evaluating the time needed for this object to travel the length of an arc that corresponds to the projected size of the blr , i.e. @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the angular length of the arc and @xmath53 is the keplerian frequency . in the most conservative case ,",
    "i.e. the case that minimizes the crossing time , the intervening object should be at @xmath54lt - days ( see equation  [ eq : rblr ] ) , so that it can intercept a substantial fraction of the broad balmer line flux . even in the extreme limit where we assume @xmath55 and m@xmath56 , the crossing time of such an obscurer would be @xmath310 years .",
    "more realistically , the intervening object should be placed at @xmath57lt - days , so that it can cover a substantial portion of the gas in the blr , specifically gas at low velocities that contributes flux to the cores of the line profile , in which case we obtain @xmath58years .    not only are these time scales too long to explain the observations shown here , but it is not obvious whether intervening material with the necessary physical properties required to obscure the entire continuum region and blr could exist at such radii .",
    "for instance , one possibility for such an obscuring medium located at these distances is the obscuring torus that lies at the outskirts of the blr , beyond the dust sublimation radius . based on near - ir reverberation mapping campaigns ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , this sublimation radius is 45 times larger than the optical emitting blr : movement of this material into the line of sight to cover the blr would be set by the same , long time scales as the general obscurer just discussed .",
    "another obscuration scenario is the possibility that the dimming of the continuum facilitates the formation , not just transport , of dust that can cover the blr .",
    "however , assuming a gas density of 10@xmath59 @xmath60 , appropriate for the torus ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the dust formation time scale is @xmath310@xmath61  years ( see equation  ( 8) of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is much too long for this scenario to be viable .    additionally , variable absorption fails to explain other observables : broadening and skewness ( asymmetry ) of the h@xmath1 line in the latter epoch ; the lack of absorption signatures in the x - ray spectra when the x - ray emission diminished ; and a similar drop in observed x - ray and optical fluxes ( a factor of 7.2 vs. 5.5 , respectively ) , since absorption should affect the latter much more than the former if the same source of obscuration is responsible for suppressing both the x - ray and optical emission . to produce this latter effect via obscuration , a dust cloud of low optical depth would need to block the line - of - sight to the blr while a gas cloud of much higher optical depth would have to attenuate emission from the x - ray emitting corona , where the column densities of both clouds would have to be fine tuned so that the optical and x - ray fluxes drop by the same amount .",
    "an alternate hypothesis is that the agn continuum faded , diminishing the power available to ionize the gas around the black hole .",
    "indeed , the fact that the fitted h@xmath1 emission profile broadened between 2000 and 2010 , resulting in the same black hole masses being measured using the h@xmath1 and @xmath25l@xmath26 values obtained from each epoch , suggests that such a dimming took place : as the continuum faded , fewer ionizing photons were available to excite the blr gas , causing the subsequent emission to be concentrated over a smaller range of radii , l@xmath26 measured from the 2010 boss spectrum , we estimate that r@xmath62 shrank to @xmath314 light days . ]",
    "and we are thereby sampling regions closer to the black hole where the velocities are higher .",
    "furthermore , the gas in the blr orbits the black hole with a keplerian velocity , such that the fwhm of the emitted broad lines scales as @xmath63 .",
    "based on reverberation mapping studies , @xmath64 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath65 is the agn continuum luminosity , so that the fwhm scales as @xmath66 . between 2000 and 2010 , the broad - component to h@xmath1 decreased by a factor of 0.67 , which is almost identical to @xmath67l@xmath68/@xmath25l@xmath69)@xmath70 , i.e. , 0.65 , providing additional evidence that we have a direct view of the blr .",
    "the change in the broad emission lines may be explained by the paradigm proposed by @xcite , who demonstrated that a decrease in accretion rate is associated with a decrease in bolometric luminosity powering the blr , which leads to an evolution in spectral type .",
    "they find a trend between agn type and eddington rate and l@xmath35/m@xmath71 , which systematically decreases along the sequence from type 1 @xmath72 1.2/1.5 @xmath72 1.8/1.9 @xmath72 2.0 .",
    "our calculated l@xmath35/m@xmath71 values ( 39.5 and 38.7 dex between the type 1 and type 1.9 stage , respectively ) are consistent with the values they calculate for type 1 and type 1.8 agn from the @xcite sample ( mean values of 39.39 and 38.93 dex , respectively ) , which is used to inform their modeling .    to assess whether a rapid change in accretion rate is a plausible mechanism for the observed dimming of the continuum , we estimate the inflow time scale of gas in the inner parts of the accretion disk , where the uv continuum primarily originates . the inflow time scale is the time for a parcel of gas in the disk to move radially from a given radius to the center",
    "it is also the time scale on which the luminosity of the continuum emitted from the disk can fluctuate as a result of abrupt changes in the accretion rate . assuming the shakura - sunyaev accretion disk model @xcite and using the formulae therein , we find that radiation pressure dominates over gas pressure in the inner portion of the disk of j0159 + 0033 , given the black hole mass and eddington parameter determined above .",
    "accordingly , we cast the inflow time as @xmath73^{-1}\\ ,   \\left[\\frac{\\lambda_{\\rm edd}}{0.03}\\right]^{-2}\\ ,   \\left[\\frac{\\eta}{0.1}\\right]^{2}\\ ,   \\left[\\frac{r}{10 \\ , r_{\\rm g}}\\right]^{7/2 }   \\left[\\frac{m_{8}}{1.7}\\right ] , \\label{eq : tinflow}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the shakura - sunyaev `` viscosity '' parameter , @xmath74 is the efficiency of converting potential energy to radiation , and @xmath75 is the gravitational radius ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "we have scaled the eddington parameter and the black hole mass to the values appropriate for the 2000 sdss spectrum j0159 + 0033 and adopted commonly assumed values for the other parameters , including a radius of @xmath77 for the uv emitting region of the disk . at face value , the inflow time appears too long to be compatible with the observed variability time scale , however , numerical simulations of black hole accretion flows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate that the infall speed in the inner disk is at least several times higher than the value given by the shakura - sunyaev model .",
    "thus , the inflow time could plausibly be of the order of a few years , which _ is _ compatible with the observed variability time scale .",
    "the inflow time scale can also become shorter than the estimate of equation  ( [ eq : tinflow ] ) , if other mechanisms of angular momentum loss are invoked , such as large scale waves in the inner disk or hydromagnetic winds .",
    "it is noteworthy that the optical continuum is produced in a region of the disk that is several times larger than the uv - emitting region ( see illustration in figure 25 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and for which the inflow time is an order of magnitude longer . nonetheless , the observed variability of the optical continuum is probably driven by reprocessing of uv or x - ray light , as discussed by @xcite and @xcite and can be as rapid as the variability in those higher - frequency bands",
    ". it may be possible to test the accretion rate fluctuation scenario , if we can observe the recovery of the luminosity of j0159 + 0033 to its earlier level . according to equation  ( [ eq : tinflow ] )",
    ", the recovery time scale should be considerably longer than the dimming time scale since the eddington parameter is an order of magnitude lower in the dim state .",
    "an alternative explanation for abrupt luminosity changes may be found in different processes that operate on much shorter time scales , such as the thermal time of the inner accretion disk or its hot corona that is thought to be the source of the x - ray emission .",
    "in fact , abrupt changes in the size of x - ray emitting corona have been observed in other agn , namely phl  1092 @xcite and mrk  335 @xcite , though these sources do not show variations in their optical spectra .",
    "a future spectropolarimetric observation of j0159 + 0033 may discriminate between the obscuration and intrinsic dimming scenarios : if a broad h@xmath5 component is viewed in polarized light , this would indicate that obscuration could explain the spectral state change ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though a lack of this signature would not necessarily indicate that hidden broad emission lines do not exist ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "the different lines of observational evidence taken together suggest the following history for j0159 + 0033 over the past decade and a half . between 1998 and 2000 , the source brightened optically and was observed spectroscopically to contain broad and narrow emission lines .",
    "the object stays in a bright state for several years before fading by a magnitude compared to its brightness in 1998 .",
    "@xmath39 drops from @xmath34% to @xmath30.7% eddington between the bright and dim stage . during this time",
    ", the fraction of ionized gas in the blr decreases in response to the dimming of the central engine .",
    "the optical dimming of j0159 + 0033 coincides with a decrease in x - ray flux , which is expected as the hot corona in which the x - rays form is relatively compact and near the accretion disk , thereby responding to changes in the agn continuum on timescale much faster than the extended nlr .",
    "the fact that the narrow lines continue to be visible at least 8 years after the source dimmed , and at strengths consistent with those measured in the 2000 sdss spectrum , demonstrate that the black hole was not dormant before the observed increase in brightness in 2000 : the nlr is not compact enough to have `` turned on '' between 1998 and 2000 , otherwise we would have observed significant decreases in the fluxes of nlr emitting gas between 2000 and 2014",
    ". continued monitoring of the source will reveal if the source transitions to a pure type 2 state , as predicted by @xcite , and when the narrow lines weaken in response to the decrease in energy output from the central engine .",
    "this time scale will provide an estimate of the nlr size , should the nlr be sufficiently compact for this process to be observable within the next few decades .",
    "extreme changes observed in the optical spectra of agn are quite rare , and though this has been detected before , j0159 + 0033 is much more distant and luminous than previously reported changing - look agn .",
    "it is the first true quasar discovered to have undergone such a dramatic fading .",
    "it is interesting to note that most reported cases of spectral transition states ( the exceptions being ngc 1097 and ngc 3065 which were liners and ngc 7582 which was a sy2 ) are from a pure type 1 state to an intermediate type , or vice versa ; that is , a broad component to h@xmath1 and/or h@xmath5 never completely disappeared . in some cases , the classification of agn as an intermediate type is consistent with reddening along the line of sight to the broad line region @xcite , while this explanation has been ruled out for other objects @xcite .",
    "in fact , in a recent systematic analysis of a large number of intermediate type agn at l@xmath78 erg s@xmath4 , @xcite demonstrated that these systems are largely unobscured .",
    "@xcite used the @xcite sample to model the dependence of spectral type with accretion state to support the notion of an evolutionary pathway . in j0159 + 0033 , the observed decrease in l@xmath35/m@xmath79 between the type 1 and type 1.9 state are consistent with the @xcite evolutionary paradigm , but only as long as the accretion rate can fluctuate fast enough to account for the observed continuum variability .",
    "observations of these changing - look agn represent a valuable opportunity to directly compare black hole properties ( when in the agn - dominated state ) to host galaxy properties ( when the agn fades ) , a comparison that is typically impossible for luminous quasars since they swamp out the light from their host .",
    "future monitoring will determine whether the quasar is shutting off or if the spectral states reported here represent intermittent quasar activity , providing the first template where a quasar lifetime can be accurately estimated @xcite .",
    "indeed , a possible avenue to discover a population of sources similar to j0159 + 0033 , that is , changing - look quasars beyond the immediate universe is provided by the time domian spectroscopic survey ( tdss , morganson et al .",
    "2014 ; carried out within sdss  iv ) , which will obtain new spectra of sdss quasars that have changed their brightness by more than 0.8 magnitudes in the past decade .",
    "we have shown that one such object exists , which provides at least one data point to estimate the duty cycle of quasar activity after such statistical searches are completed .",
    "in addition , observations of these changing - look agn demonstrate that agn unification is an over - simplifying interpretation of agn spectral types , and that in some instances , agn optical classification may represent the ability of the central engine to ionize gas in its vicinity , and possibly , an evolutionary stage as the gas powering accretion ultimately disappears forever into the black hole .",
