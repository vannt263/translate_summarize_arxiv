    "rydberg atoms are weakly bound systems which can simultaneously exhibit quantum and classical behavior @xcite .",
    "this quantum to classical evolution is at the heart of the bohr - sommerfeld quantization .",
    "rydberg spectroscopy is a useful technique for probing many of the subtle properties of an atomic or molecular core , for measuring the rydberg constant , and probing interactions in the surrounding gas or plasma .",
    "the interaction and collision of a rydberg atom with the neutral and ionic species in the gas broadens and shifts the atomic lines , through which much can be learned about the scattering properties of the gas .",
    "the seminal measurements of amaldi and segr @xcite confirmed that the classical macroscopic polarization of the dielectric medium was insufficient to describe the rydberg line shifts and that the scattering of rydberg electrons from the perturber gas atoms would have to be accounted for . this led fermi to develop a zero - range scattering theory , now called the fermi pseudopotential ( or contact potential ) method @xcite .",
    "fermi realized that the low - energy scattering of a rydberg electron from a perturber gas atom can be effectively described by a short - range elastic scattering interaction ; this model has had much subsequent success in determining low - energy electron - atom scattering lengths of many other species @xcite .",
    "the form of zero - energy scattering of an s - wave electron from a perturber is then , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the electronic coordinate , measured from the rydberg core , @xmath7 is the vector connecting the rydberg nucleus to the perturber atom nucleus , and @xmath8 is the zero - energy s - wave scattering length .    the delta - function contact interaction formalism can be extended to higher scattering angular momenta ; an analytical form for p - wave scattering was derived by omont @xcite , as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the @xmath11-dependent p - wave scattering length    @xmath12    here @xmath13 is the orbital angular momentum about the perturber atom and @xmath14 denote s- and p - wave scattering of the electron from the perturber atom , respectively .    the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) potential curves , as eigenstates of the hamiltonian with @xmath15 and @xmath16 contributions , are highly oscillatory in internuclear distance @xmath17 due to the admixture of rydberg electron wave functions with high principal quantum numbers @xmath18 .",
    "it was realized in @xcite that those multi - well bo potentials can support bound vibrational levels when @xmath19 as is the case for all alkali - metal atoms .    ) .",
    "the experimental data are from ref . @xcite . ]",
    "such exotic molecular rydberg states were realized in magnetic and dipole traps , first in an ultracold gas of rb atoms @xcite , where such rydberg molecules have @xmath20 spherical symmetry .",
    "it was confirmed that , even though such molecules were homonuclear , the mixing of rb(@xmath21 ) levels with rb@xmath22 hydrogenic manifolds , produces appreciable permanent electric dipole moments in these molecular species @xcite .",
    "the prediction for rydberg molecules with kilo - debye dipole moments ( trilobite molecules ) were realized with ultracold cs atoms @xcite in which the cs@xmath23 degenerate manifolds are energetically much closer to cs(@xmath24 levels , hence providing for much stronger mixing of opposite parity electronic states .",
    "more recently , butterfly molecules ( rydberg molecules stemming from the presence of p - wave resonances ) were predicted @xcite and confirmed @xcite . in increasingly dense gases , additional molecular lines stemming from the formation of trimers , tetramers , pentamers , etc",
    "have been observed @xcite .",
    "the above scattering formalism is spin - independent , i.e. while the scattering phase shifts depend separately on the total spin of electrons , the scattering amplitudes add up incoherently .",
    "for rydberg excitation in a gas of alkali - metal atoms , the total spin channels are @xmath25 for singlet and triplet scattering , respectively , with @xmath26 and @xmath27 the rydberg electron and the perturber ground electron spins .    in this work",
    "we will account for all of the relevant and relativistic effects in rydberg perturber atom scattering .",
    "we include all of the fine structure resolved s- and p - wave scattering hamiltonians , the rydberg electron spin - orbit , and the ground electron hyperfine interactions . from the resulting bo potentials we not only predict the spatial structure and energies of the rydberg molecules but",
    "can also reproduce the spectral line profiles in the recent experiment @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fullspectra ] .",
    "the total hamiltonian with all spin degrees of freedom included is , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the hamiltonian for the unperturbed rydberg atom , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the ( s - wave , p - wave ) scattering hamiltonians for triplet and singlet spin configurations , respectively . the operators @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the triplet and singlet projection operators for the total electronic spin .",
    "it was first pointed out by anderson _",
    "_ @xcite that the ground state hyperfine interaction can mix singlet and triplet spin configurations .",
    "the hyperfine hamiltonian is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the nuclear spin and @xmath36 is the hyperfine interaction ; in cs , the focus of this work , @xmath36 = 2298.1579425 mhz , and @xmath37 .",
    "_ demonstrated this in rb , where they observed bound vibrational levels due to mixing of singlet and triplet spins , even though the singlet zero energy scattering length for rb is known to be small and positive .",
    "this is particularly important as , in magneto - optical and magnetic traps , spin alignment dictates that the interactions occur via the triplet scattering channel .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction for the rydberg electron , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the orbital momentum and @xmath40 is the spin - orbit strength for @xmath41 levels .",
    "_ neglected this term , because it scales as @xmath42 . for intermediate @xmath18 , however , the spin - orbit splitting will be comparable to the hyperfine splitting .",
    "the details of the matrix elements of @xmath43 and the terms for cs(np ) states will follow below .",
    "recent studies have explored the extent to which spin effects are necessary to properly predict , _ ab initio _ , the vibrational spectra of these molecules , largely concluding that fine , hyperfine , and p - wave effects can have significant effects on these spectra @xcite . to date , no study has incorporated all of the interaction terms ( s - wave , p - wave , spin - orbit , and hyperfine ) on the vibrational spectra of cs rydberg molecules .",
    "due to the large hyperfine shift in @xmath44cs , and the existence of several p - wave resonances at intermediate energies , these contributions can be significant in cs .",
    "the current results are employed here to interpret the observations by samannshausen _",
    "the matrix elements of the unperturbed rydberg hamiltonian ( @xmath29 ) are calculated from the solutions @xmath45 to the equation @xmath46 , where the quantum defects @xmath47 for cs atom levels are used as follows :    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     while for @xmath48 , @xmath49 takes on its hydrogenic values : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the land g - factor , @xmath52 is the vacuum permeability , and @xmath53 is the bohr magneton .    in the uncoupled angular momentum basis , the operator @xmath54 has the representation  @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 are the ladder operators for the rydberg electron orbital angular momentum and spin .",
    "this representation allows to determine the matrix elements between different combinations of angular harmonic @xmath57 and spinors @xmath58 @xmath59 they are @xmath60 through the ladder terms , the spin - orbit coupling will therefore couple @xmath61 and @xmath62- states , as well as singlet ( s=0 ) and triplet ( s=1 ) states .
