    "i learned of josh s work in relativity first in june 1959 .",
    "we were invited to participate , and give talks on relativity , at the _ universit libre _ in brussels , the home of the de donder condition and george edward lematre .",
    "this meeting with francophone mathematicians was the prelude to the relativistic oratorio at _",
    "labbaye de royaumont _ some 30 km north of paris .",
    "a large number of american relativists had been given a free ride to fly from mcguire air force base in new jersey to europe on mats ( military air transportation service ) that had delivered the berlin air bridge .",
    "the trip on mats apparently had also done a lot for their egos : to qualify for this perk they had to be given equivalent military ranks to their civilian position . and which graduate student did not cherish to suddenly become a colonel , or which assistant professor did not like to be instantly promoted to one - star general ? however , at that time , i did not yet realize that this massive air lift of american relativists was also the work of josh directed from wright - patterson air force base in ohio .",
    "when i mentioned josh s work , i actually meant a talk about a paper by josh goldberg and ted newman given in brussels .",
    "the paper _ on the measurement of distance in general relativity _ is published in vol .",
    "114 of the physical review .",
    "i believe that ted gave the talk because i seem to remember that it was given by a very forceful speaker in an almost breathless way expressing his thoughts with his hands .",
    "the essential idea was the use of the formulae for geodesic deviation about null geodesics .",
    "it was this technique that led to the beautiful goldberg - sachs theorem .",
    "in royaumont i remember evening walks in the warm summer of the ilde de france . at that time i had no idea that in this renaissance of relativity josh was the duke de medici . by supporting researchers in america ,",
    "britain and germany and using the resources of the us air force josh contributed greatly to a new start for einstein s theory of gravitation .",
    "we hope that historians of relativity will show us the important role that josh did play for its development . -e.l.s .",
    "the proof of the poincar conjecture by grigory perelman @xcite has raised the interest in ricci flows .",
    "they were introduced by richard hamilton in 1982 @xcite and became the basic instrument for the proof .",
    "the flow can be defined as follows .",

    "are the ricci flows in 3-dimensional manifolds .",
    "the normalized ricci flow equation @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the average of the scalar curvature @xmath7 over the compact 3-manifold , was discussed by james isenberg and martin jackson for locally homogeneous geometries on closed manifolds @xcite .",
    "we are studying hamilton s _ evolution equation _ ( [ int.1 ] ) which leads to a collapse of the manifold in a finite timespan .    over the years , the first two authors have been interested in models of the universe , and a dozen years ago , they discussed a study on the embedding of compact 3-manifolds into eucidean spaces in @xcite .",
    "there , they gave a geometric classification of anisotropically but homogeneously stretched 3-dimensional spheres and their curvatures .",
    "here , we wish to complete and extend this discussion by studying the evolution of these @xmath8 s under the ricci flow .",
    "it turns out that the 6 non - linear pde s ( [ int.1 ] ) reduce to a single ode that can be integrated completely in two particularly interesting cases .",
    "a simple numerical integration provides a picture of the ricci flow lines . to keep this paper entirely self - contained",
    ", we reproduce the diagrams of @xcite and their legends and give the derivation of the ricci tensor for the evolution equation ( [ int.1 ] ) .",
    "the simple formulae for the principal curvatures give expressions that look similar to those occuring in the elementary geometry of triangles , namely those for in- and ex - circles and for heron s formula .",
    "this lets us expect that some beautiful solid geometry in the tori of clifford parallels remains to be discovered in these harmonious universes .",
