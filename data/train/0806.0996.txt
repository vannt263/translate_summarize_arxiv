    "dissipative structures ,  patterns in spatially extended systems away from equilibrium have been intensively studied for many decades . a very comprehensive review can be found in @xcite ; results obtained since then would probably require an even more extensive review . a very popular class of mathematical models is the reaction - diffusion systems with diagonal diffusion matrices .",
    "there have been numerous indications that non - diagonal elements in diffusion matrices , cross - diffusion , can lead to new nontrivial effects not observed in classical reaction - diffusion systems ,  _ quasi - solitons _ in systems with excitable reaction part @xcite .",
    "however oscillatory systems are more prevalent than excitable and nontrivial effects of cross - diffusion in oscillatory systems have not been studied yet .",
    "here we consider an example where the reaction part of the system is dissipative while the diffusion part is not .",
    "we describe spontaneously generated periodic waves , and identify the features of these waves that indicate that we are dealing here with a phenomenon not seen before .",
    "a general formulation of a reaction - diffusion system with nonlinear diffusion is @xmath0 both the reaction term @xmath1 and the diffusion term @xmath2 in the right - hand side represent dissipative processes , which for diffusion implies that matrix @xmath3 is positive ( semi-)definite , typically diagonal with non - negative elements .",
    "a huge amount of results have been obtained about pattern formation described by such models .",
    "however , many physical situations lead to non - diagonal elements in @xmath4 , cross - diffusion ( see  discussions in @xcite ) .",
    "some such situations may be adequately described by @xmath4 whose eigenvalues have zero real part ,  when the self - diffusion of components is negligible . in such cases reaction part",
    "is dissipative and the `` diffusion '' part is not .",
    "physical consequences of such ambivalence are little understood yet .",
    "cross diffusion has been seen to produce interesting phenomena , such as fronts , pulses and stationary periodic structures ( see @xcite among many other works ) , however phenomenologically similar regimes are known in reaction - diffusion systems , too .    in a recent series of works we have described unusual phenomena , such as quasi - solitons and their variations , in excitable systems in which linear or nonlinear cross - diffusion was added to or replaced self - diffusion ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the ability of a medium to conduct solitary waves is stipulated by its excitable kinetics described by the reaction term @xmath1 , whereas specifics of their interaction are also due to the cross - diffusion terms . however , excitability is a relatively exotic , albeit very important , type of behaviour compared to oscillations .",
    "for instance , in population dynamics , plausible excitable predator - prey models have been proposed @xcite but we are not aware of reliable observations of natural systems described by such models . on the other hand ,",
    "oscillatory behaviour in predator - prey systems is textbook material @xcite and there are plentiful observational data on traveling waves in cyclic populations @xcite",
    ".    solitary waves in oscillatory systems are not feasible , and it is not clear what new features cross - diffusion may impose .        the purpose of this communication is to describe new phenomena we have observed in oscillatory systems with `` pursuit - evasion '' nonlinear cross - diffusion interaction between the components .",
    "we consider two predator - prey models with cross - diffusion terms of `` pursuit - evasion '' mutual taxis , @xmath5 for @xmath6\\times[0,t_{\\max}]$ ] for two reaction kinetics , the truscott - brindley ( tb ) model @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 unless stated otherwise , and the rosenzweig - macarthur ( ma ) model @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 unless stated otherwise .",

    "this distance varies irregularly , indicating that spontaneous generation of waves is associated with an instability , thus sensitive dependence on initial conditions and probably chaotic dynamics .",
