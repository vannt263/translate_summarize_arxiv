    "the proximity of m51 ( as in arcavi et al .",
    "2011b we assume a distance , @xmath5 mpc ) motivated searches for the progenitor star .",
    "a putative massive star detected by the hubble space telescope in pre - explosion images of m51 very close to the sn position was described by maund et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and van dyk et al .",
    "the interpretation of the progenitor is uncertain .",
    "based on the rapid cooling of the expanding sn ejecta , arcavi et al .",
    "( 2011b ) argue that the progenitor star must have a radius smaller than that of typical red supergiants or the supergiant progenitor of the well - studied type iib sn 1993j , see e.g. , weiler et al .",

    "in contrast , the astrometrically coincident star is a f8 supergiant . reconciling these constraints",
    "means that the supergiant is either unrelated to the sn or was a companion of the ( now erstwhile ) progenitor star .    for core collapse",
    "supernovae the interaction of the blast wave with the circumstellar medium can generate detectable radio and x - ray emission .",
    "additionally the fastest moving ejecta is related to the size of the progenitor ( the more compact , the higher the velocity ; chevalier &  soderberg 2010 ) .",
    "these two properties motivate early radio and x - ray observations .",
    "thus , we began a program of centimeter and millimeter wave observations of sn2011dh with evla and carma respectively .",
    "we initiated x - ray observations with the _ swift _ observatory . following the end of our early monitoring a long - term program at evla",

    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the millimeter ( carma ) and centimeter ( evla ) observations are summarized in  [ sec : carma - evla ] . in  [ sec : ssa ] we carry out a standard analysis for the radio observations assuming a synchrotron self - absorbed model .",

    "we present our conclusions as well as review the returns obtained from early millimeter wave observations of core collapse supernovae (  [ sec : conclusions ] ) .",
    "such a review is timely given the imminent operation of the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) .",
    "starting june 4 , 2011 , observations were undertaken with carma , centered on either 107 ghz or 93 ghz with an 8 ghz bandwidth in the d array configuration . for flux calibration we used either uranus ( whose flux was bootstrapped from observations of 3c345 ) or mars .",
    "the compact source j1153 + 495 was used as a phase calibrator .",
    "the carma data were reduced using the miriad reduction software .",
    "the log of observations can be found in table  [ tab : radiolog ] and a montage of carma detections is shown in figure  [ fig : carmamontage ] .        observations with the evla were undertaken in the framework of our program `` ptf transients in the local universe '' ( pi : kasliwal ) as well as a too program to observe type ii supernovae ( pi : c. stockdale ) .",

    "the radio emission arises from relativistic particles , which are accelerated at the shock , gyrating in magnetic fields , generated in the post - shock gas ( chevlaier 1982 ; chevalier 1998 ; weiler et al .",
    "a large body of work confirms that ( for most supernovae ) the early radio emission can be described by a synchrotron self - absorption ( ssa ) model ( chevalier 1998 ) .",
    "while internal free - free absorption might also be present at early times , the lack of a steeper spectrum at the optically thick part of the spectrum suggests that ssa is dominant ( see also appendix 1 ) .",
    "hence , throughout this paper we adopt chevalier ( 1998 ) ssa model .    assuming a simple power law for the energy of the relativistic particles , the synchrotron emission for a self - absorbed source can be described by @xmath15 for frequency , @xmath16 below @xmath17 , where @xmath17 is the frequency at which the optical depth from synchrotron self - absorption is unity , and @xmath18 for frequencies above @xmath19 . here",

    "the ssa model does not attempt to predict the absolute or even the relative fraction of the two key components , the energy in relativistic electrons and the strength of the magnetic field",
    ". however , the minimum total energy will be achieved at equipartition , i.e. , when the energy in the relativistic electrons is equal to that of the magnetic fields or @xmath25 ( see readhead 1994 ) . here",
    "@xmath26 is the ratio of the energy in relativistic electrons to that of the magnetic fields .",
    "the measurement of the single - epoch ssa spectrum ( both the optically thick and the optically thin parts ) can be inverted to yield the radius and the magnetic field at that epoch ( chevalier 1998 ) . for @xmath27 ( which is the relevant case here ; see  3.1 ) : @xmath28 and @xmath29 here , @xmath30 is the peak flux , and @xmath31 is the peak frequency .",
    "we assume @xmath32 ( see chevalier & fransson 2006 ) .",
    "equations  [ eq : ssa1 ] and [ eq : ssa2 ] are adequate to describe the broad - band spectrum at any given epoch , as long as the emission is ssa .",
    "the dynamics of the supernova shell ( which in turn depend on the velocity profile of the blast wave and the radial density distribution of the circumstellar medium ) determine @xmath21 and @xmath17 .",
    "these dependencies are generalized by allowing for power - law variations in key quantities ( weiler et al .",
    "2002 ) and leading to the following equations : @xmath33 where the absorption expression describes an internal absorption by material mixed with the emitting component and assumes planar geometry .",
    "the ssa optical depth is described by @xmath34 where both @xmath35 and @xmath36 are proportionality constants that can be determined by fitting the data , and @xmath37 describes the time dependence of the optical depth .",

    "we note that the last c- , and x - band observation were made on june 12 rather than on june 11 and therefore we obtain the c- , and x - band fluxes for june 11 by interpolation . for each epoch",
    "we fit the evla - carma spectrum to the ssa model characterized by @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( equations [ eq : ssa1 ] and [ eq : ssa2 ] ) .",

    "2007 ) . to generate the  light curve ( see figure  [ fig : snxray ] ) , we fix the source position at the known location of the sn and extract a light curve with half - day binning ( 43.2  ksec per time bin ) using an aperture of 35.4 . for background subtraction , we determine the time - average count rate in this identical aperture , @xmath90 cts  ( 0.310 kev ) , from pre-  data .",
    "the sn  emission appears to fade rapidly at early times , so we split the observations in two for purposes of  spectral analysis , fitting data from the first three time bins separately from the rest .",
    "the data are then fit to  spectral models in xspec v 12.7.0 ( arnaud 1996 ) , using a common hydrogen column density ( @xmath91 ) across the full duration of the  observations and allowing the power - law photon ( @xmath92 ) index and time - average flux to vary between the two data - sets .",
    "the resulting fit yields the following spectral parameters , where uncertainties here and below are quoted at 90%-confidence : @xmath93@xmath94 ; @xmath95 ; and @xmath96 .",
    "the results suggests a softening of the  emission over the course of the  observations but note that the photon index overlaps for @xmath97 at the 90%-confidence intervals .",
    "prior to analyzing the resulting  flux light - curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig : snxray ] ) , we incorporate  flux measurements from pooley ( 2011 ) and soderberg et al .",
    "( 2011 ) ; these are converted to our chosen 0.310kev bandpass using the authors chosen spectral models and the webpimms tool .",
    "analyzing the resulting  light - curve , we find that it may be adequately characterized ( in a @xmath98 sense ) as a monotonic power - law decay emission .",
    "the single power - law temporal decay index is @xmath99 over the interval of  and  observations .",
    "the  data confirm the absence of significant contaminating source emission within the  xrt aperture ( pooley et al .",
    "2011 ; soderberg et al .",
    "the x - ray photon index is 1.1 ( early times ) and 1.9 ( late times ) .",
    "the high frequency radio spectral index is @xmath100 which corresponds to a photon index of @xmath101 .",
    "the x - ray emission is elevated by a factor of 50 relative to extrapolation of the ssa spectrum .",
    "thus we conclude that the x - ray emission is not a result of synchrotron emission .",
    "moreover , as already shown by soderberg et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , thermal free - free x - ray emission is ruled out .",
    "another explanation for the x - ray emission is that it arises from inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of optical photons .",
    "of a few gauss .",
    "a @xmath41 of 30 ghz would require a lorentz factor , @xmath102 .",
    "these electrons can inverse scatter sn optical photons to the x - ray band . ]    assuming that the x - ray emission arises from ic , the ssa and ic formulation of katz ( 2011 ) can be used to infer @xmath21 and @xmath20 . for @xmath27 @xmath103 @xmath104 where @xmath105",

    "the estimated error ( obtained from application of the rule of error propagations ) is @xmath111 .",
    "these values of @xmath20 are @xmath112 smaller than the corresponding estimates obtained from an equipartition analysis (  [ sec : equip ] ) .",
    "nominally , by using equation  [ eq : b ] again , @xmath113 to 1700 with @xmath114 as a reasonable mean ( which we adopt ) .",
    "however , as can be seen from equation  [ eq : r ] this only results in a 30% decrease in the value of @xmath21 , relative to that obtained from equipartition analysis (  [ sec : equip ] ) .",
    "thus , the mean velocity is @xmath115cms@xmath66 . the electron density is now higher by a factor of @xmath116 and therefore the mass - loss rate is higher by a factor of @xmath117 ( for a fixed wind velocity ) .",
    "in this paper we present the earliest millimeter- and centimeter - wave monitoring observations of the type iib supernova sn2011dh in the galaxy m51 , between four days and @xmath118 days after the event . using the wide frequency coverage of the evla ( 4 to 43 ghz ) and carma ( 100 ghz ) we measure the key parameters of the synchrotron self - absorbed spectrum .",
    "the radio observations were accompanied by extensive x - ray observations by _ swift_. the x - ray emission , argued to be inverse compton scattering of the sn optical photons by the relativistic electrons that produced the radio emission , combined with the radio observations , allow us to relax the equipartition assumption and track the radius and circumstellar density .",
    "we infer a mean velocity of @xmath119cms@xmath66 , for the sn shockwave , with an uncertainty entirely dominated by the limitations of the theoretical framework . within the framework of the model",
    "the velocity is 1.32 to 1.68 @xmath120cms@xmath66 .",
    "this value range is larger than the @xmath121cms@xmath66 expected for an extended progenitor ( red supergiant ) but smaller than the @xmath122cms@xmath66 expected for a compact progenitor .",
    "this may have important implications for the evolution leading to the formation of the progenitors of sne iib : if sne iib are split into two distinct , well - separated classes , that would suggest they may arise from two different evolutionary scenarios . on the other hand , if additional intermediate objects are found , that may suggest a continuum of objects between eiib and ciib , a single progenitor class may be favored .",

    "we find @xmath123 .",
    "the error bars are too large to directly constrain the physical nature of the envelope of the exploding star ( radiative versus convective ) . assuming no additional systematics the combination of the early measurements with observations over several months may provide the means to determine the deceleration phase of the shock - wave in a more precise way and",
    "indirectly may shed more light on the density profile of the outer layers of the progenitor .",
    "soderberg et al .",
    "( 2012 ) infer a much higher shock - wave velocity , @xmath124cms@xmath66 , when assuming equipartition .",
    "as noted in  1 their analysis primarily rested on the x - ray data and optical data , shock - wave velocity , mass - loss rate , wind velocity , and time . ]",
    "( since the radio data was quite sparse , day 4 and day 17 ) .",
    "the limitations naturally propagate to the robustness of their inferences .",
    "this caveat notwithstanding , these authors find @xmath125 , a factor of @xmath126 lower than the value we find , suggesting a shockwave velocity of @xmath127cms@xmath66 . at least within the framework of the ssa+ic model we believe that our inference is more robust , thanks to our comprehensive radio and x - ray data sets .",
    "moreover , as mentioned above , there is a factor of @xmath86 difference between the derived equipartition mass - loss rate value in our analysis compared to soderberg et al .",
    "( 2012 ) the origin of this difference is in the way this value is calculated and in the assumptions made . while soderberg et al .",
    "( 2012 ) assume @xmath128 we do not make such an assumption .",
    "our measurements suggest @xmath129 which accounts for the different mass - loss rate values .",
    "another set of comprehensive radio data was presented by krauss et al .",
    "( 2012 ) for days @xmath130 after explosion .",
    "in their analysis they assumed equipartition only and found an average velocity of @xmath131 km / s .",
    "furthermore , assuming @xmath128 , they found a mass - loss rate @xmath132 times greater than what we find . in view of these differences we analysed the data presented in krauss et al .",
    "( 2012 ) in the same manner that we analysed the early data set we present above .",
    "our analysis suggests an average shockwave velocity of @xmath133 km / s at later times .",
    "our derived lower velocity can be explained by a few factors .",
    "first , our fitting method allows the electron energy power - law index , @xmath39 , to vary .",
    "we find an average value of @xmath134 , while krauss et al .",
    "( 2012 ) keep the power - law index constant at @xmath27 .",
    "this leads to slightly different values of the peak flux and frequency which in turn leads to a lower value of the velocity .",
    "another factor that contributes to the difference between krauss et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and our velocity value is the different coefficient used in equation @xmath86 . while we are using the coefficient from chevalier et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , krauss et al .",
    "( 2012 ) use a coefficient which is larger by @xmath135 . when using krauss et al .",
    "( 2012 ) values for the peak frequencies and fluxes in equation @xmath86 using our coefficient , we find an average shockwave velocity of @xmath136 km / s which is consistent with our results given our errors .    in light of the above uncertainty in the radius coefficient and in the fitting method ( constant vs. varying electron power - law index @xmath39 )",
    ", we note that the uncertainty in derived values of the shockwave properties is greater than the error measurements alone .",
    "the different uncertainties , combined , can be as high as @xmath137 .",
    "therefore , any conclusion based on the absolute derived value of the shockwave properties such as its velocity , is weakened .",
    "the time evolution of these properties is less sensitive to the above uncertainties and therefore may provide a more robust diagnostic .    on another matter ,",
    "thanks to broad banding , improved receivers , and a flexible correlator , the expanded vla ( evla ) has sensitivity gains ranging from factor of 2 to 10 in the 140 ghz band .",
    "separately , there have been relentless and steady improvements in the continuum sensitivity of millimeter wave arrays ( carma , pdbi ) with the alma now offering an order of magnitude increase in sensitivity in the millimeter and sub - millimeter bands .",
    "these great improvements offer powerful diagnostics in two ways .",
    "first , both synchrotron self - absorption and free - free absorption ( from the circumstellar medium ) depends strongly on frequency .",
    "high frequency observations can be sensibly undertaken at very early times .",
    "( evla bands are usually self - absorbed at , say , day 1 ) .",
    "thus , early millimeter wave observations can probe the fastest moving ejecta ( since in a homologous flow the fastest moving ejecta is at the greatest radius ) .",
    "next , the intrinsic ssa spectrum is modified by the external free - free optical absorption .",
    "this is best measured by comparing lower frequency measurements to higher frequency measurements .",
