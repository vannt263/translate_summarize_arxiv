    "systems of colloidal particles that interact with pair potentials that feature short - ranged attraction have been extensively studied in the literature .",
    "the typical bulk phase diagram shows a characteristic gas - liquid phase transition that can become metastable with respect to freezing for sufficiently short range of attraction  @xcite . while the addition of a short - ranged soft repulsion is known to change the phase diagram  @xcite only quantitatively , a repulsion with a range larger than that of the attraction can have a dramatic effect on the topology of the phase diagram  @xcite",
    "moreover , both in experiments and in dynamical simulations the equilibrium phase diagram for systems with competing interactions is often overshadowed by non - equilibrium phenomena such as vitrification , gelation and cluster formation  @xcite . typically , pair potentials with a short - ranged attraction show spontaneous clustering of particles at sufficiently low temperatures . the geometric structure of clusters of particles has been studied theoretically , e.g. for the lennard - jones potential  @xcite , hard spheres  @xcite , and hard spheres that additionally interact with a short - ranged attraction  @xcite .",
    "the structures obtained using the morse potential were analyzed by  @xcite and by  @xcite and compared to those from the asakura - oosawa potential  @xcite .",
    "stable clusters of colloids are interesting because they can be viewed as colloidal molecules  @xcite that can potentially be used as building blocks for the fabrication of novel materials .",
    "the size and geometric structure of colloidal clusters , however , are not easily controllable in experiments .",
    "several different methods that offer control of the clustering process have been proposed .",
    "@xcite prepared clusters using janus colloidal particles , i.e. spherical particles that possess oppositely charged hemispheres .",
    "cluster of particles with larger numbers of patches have also been studied  @xcite .",
    "@xcite succeeded in preparing clusters of magnetic particles .",
    "one particularly promising approach , based on the evaporation of the dispersed phase in an emulsion , was developed  @xcite by  @xcite . here",
    "colloidal particles adsorb at the interface between dispersed and continuous phase in order to minimize the interfacial free energy ( pickering effect )  @xcite . during evaporation",
    "the particles are pushed together by capillary forces and subsequently held together by van der waals interactions .",
    "@xcite prepared micron - sized clusters using this technique with polystyrene microspheres that were 844 nm in diameter .",
    "the authors found clusters of particles with packings that minimize the second moment of the mass distribution .",
    "the emulsion method is versatile and was subsequently used to obtain clusters of particles 220 nm in diameter  @xcite , of patchy particles  @xcite , and of bidisperse colloids  @xcite .",
    "shear was used by @xcite to produce monodispersed droplets .",
    "a similar technique is based on aerosol droplets  @xcite instead of oil droplets .",
    "similar in spirit to the emulsion evaporation technique , an alternative miniemulsion technique  @xcite was recently developed . here",
    ", a miniemulsion is prepared from a standard emulsion by ultrasonication .",
    "the sound waves produce an emulsion of small droplets in a process of fission and fusion [ 65 ] .",
    "the average size of the droplets can be tuned in the range of 360 nm to 1800 nm  @xcite .",
    "small colloidal particles can then be used in solution with the small monodispersed droplets of the miniemulsion to obtain clusters  @xcite that have diameters much smaller than 1 @xmath0 .",
    "although these clusters can consist of many constituent colloidal spheres , they remain small enough to reside in the colloidal domain  @xcite , i.e. brownian motion thermalizes such systems .",
    "therefore hierarchical self - assembly comes within reach .",
    "in contrast to the large body of experimental work and the closely related theoretical efforts to understand the resulting cluster structures and their symmetries , little theoretical work has been done to describe the _ process _ of cluster formation .",
    "@xcite proposed a model for a dispersion of hard spheres and emulsion droplets , but these authors did not investigate cluster formation .",
    "@xcite modeled and simulated the evaporation - driven assembly of colloidal particles .",
    "they considered individual droplets with varying numbers of adsorbed particles and calculated the ( non - spherical , in general ) shape of the oil - water interface by the requirement of minimal surface free energy .",
    "they considered different values of the contact angle and reported good agreement with experimental findings .",
    "very recently , @xcite studied the stability of larger colloidosome - like shells of particles , albeit without modeling the assembly process .    in this paper",
    "we present a basic model to describe the process of cluster assembly through emulsion droplet evaporation .",
    "we use monte carlo computer simulations to study the cluster formation of colloids with competing short - ranged attraction and long - ranged repulsion interactions . differently from @xcite",
    "we also simulate the dynamical capture of the colloidal particles onto droplet surfaces and studied not only the cluster structures , but also analyzes the histograms of the cluster size distribution .",
    "we complement these calculations with experiments of polystyrene particles in an oil - in - water emulsion .",
    "we use cryogenic field emission scanning electron microscopy ( cryo - fesem ) and field emission scanning electron microscopy ( fesem ) to investigate the intermediate and final stages of cluster formation , respectively .",
    "the cryo - fesem micrographs show the distribution of small particles on a droplet surface .",
    "we find the simulation results to be in good agreement with the experimental results for both intermediate and final cluster structures .",
    "we also find good quantitative agreement between experimental and simulation results for the cluster size distribution .",
    "having demonstrated the validity of our model , we study the possibility of hierarchical self - assembly , by carrying out simulations of a mixture of thermal tetrahedral clusters and emulsion droplets .",

    "we find that the structure of the single component fluid is largely composed of single particles with only 1% of particles belonging to doublets .",
    "larger clusters are not formed during the span of our simulations .",
    "this can be explained easily by the following argument .",
    "the minimum distance between colloidal particles is at the beginning of the simulation larger than @xmath38 . in order to form a bond ,",
    "the colloidal particles have to overcome the repulsive energy barrier ( @xmath88 ) of the colloid - colloid interaction . the probability to thermally overcome",
    "this barrier is very small , and in order to form larger clusters the particles have to be forced beyond the repulsive barrier .",
    "hence , in the restricted time interval that is accessible in the simulations , the colloidal fluid is ( quasi-)stable . however , for longer times further clustering might occur ( see discussion in the sec .",
    "[ s : sim ] ) .    in the binary mixture ,",
    "a clustering mechanism is provided by the shrinking droplets .",
    "the formation of small clusters implies that only a limited number of particles are bound onto the droplets .",
    "the small size of our particle makes them ideal for the self - assembly of small clusters that are well suited as building blocks for subsequent self - assembly , but prevented us to follow the assembly process in experiments in real space like  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we studied their distribution in the experimental emulsions with cryo - fesem . the micrographs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cry ] ) indicate a random distribution of the positions of the particles at the droplet surface .",
    "the void in the center presents the imprint of the frozen dispersed phase , i.e. a single micron - sized toluene droplet .",
    "the polystyrene particles left in the cavity after sublimation of toluene are randomly distributed at the former droplet surface . because toluene is a good solvent for polystyrene , the particles are significantly swollen at the droplet interface as expressed by a larger diameter .",
    "this agrees with the fact that the micrograph indicates that the polystyrene particles prefer the dispersed toluene phase .",
    "the position distribution of the particles on the droplet surface in simulations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : snp]b and inset fig .",
    "[ fig : cry ] ) is in good agreement with the experiment and indicates that the particles can freely diffuse on the surface of the droplets .    in simulations ,",
    "we consider the case that the particle surface has no preference of whether it wets oil or water .",
    "hence the contact angle at a ( planar ) oil - water interface is 90@xmath89 because of the assumption that the colloid - solvent interfacial tension is equal to the colloid - droplet interfacial tension  see the discussion above eq.([eq : dc ] ) . despite the difference in contact angle between simulation and experiments",

    "[ fig : snap1]b ) .",
    "no single particles or other than tetrahedral cluster structures were present .",
    "the tetrahedral clusters are thermal in the sense that the particles forming the clusters are kept together solely by the short - ranged attraction and can in principle dissolve , i.e. bonds can break on a long time scale by thermal activation . in experiments ,",
    "bond breaking is even more unlikely because clusters are held together by van der waals interactions , which are much stronger than the attraction used in our model .",
    "nevertheless , structures that require bond - breaking in order to form are easily recognized .",

    "this cluster formation is possible only because one of the initial tetrahedral clusters has dissolved .",
    "this structure is therefore not accessible experimentally when non - thermal clusters are used .",
    "[ fig : snap3]c ) shows superclusters of three tetrahedra , while fig .",
    "[ fig : snap3]d ) shows a supertetrahedron , i.e. a cluster formed by four tetrahedra arranged a tetrahedral geometry .",
    "we investigated cluster formation via emulsion droplet evaporation with computer simulations and experiments .",
    "we used metropolis monte carlo simulations to model the process of cluster formation in a binary mixture of colloidal particles and emulsion droplets .",
    "the colloidal particles interact via both a short - ranged attraction and a long - ranged repulsion , while the second component that represents the emulsion droplets interacts only with an attractive well with the colloids .",
    "this potential well has a minimum at the droplet surface in order to induce the pickering effect .",
    "the droplet - droplet interaction is a hard - core interaction with a hard - sphere diameter chosen so that the droplets can not merge .",
    "the droplets shrink at a fixed rate , in order to model experimental conditions of droplet evaporation .",
    "we also performed experiments on polystyrene spheres 154 @xmath136 in diameter in a toluene - water emulsion .",
    "the emulsion was vitrified and analyzed with cryo - fesem , before the evaporation process .",
    "the micrographs indicated a random distribution of the positions of the particles that are trapped at the droplet surface .",
    "these results can be surprising because charged particles act as electric dipoles when trapped onto droplets due to the effect that the part of their surface exposed to the nonpolar solvent ( toluene ) can not sustain its charge",
    ". the resulting long - ranged dipolar repulsions may result in regular spatially separated arrangements of the particles at the interface  @xcite . for micron - sized particles this is supported by optical micrographs that indicate polyhedral arrangements when a small number of particles are bound onto an emulsion droplet  @xcite .",
    "a different scenario can be expected for our submicron - sized particles because their higher diffusivity can interfere with repulsive interactions , and suppress regular orientation .",
    "interestingly , an earlier study of droplets stabilized by a large number of submicron - sized colloids could even demonstrate that the particles are not necessarily kept separated from each other and can form close - packed islands or even a monolayer  @xcite .",
    "computer simulation snapshots and radial distribution functions were used to analyze the dynamics of cluster formation in computer simulation . in agreement with experimental results",
    "we find that in our model the particles can freely diffuse on the surface of the droplet before the evaporating droplets force particle agglomeration into clusters .",
    "the degree of ordering of the particles on the droplet surface depends on the range of the repulsive interaction , ( debye screening length ) that in our model is of the order of two particle diameters . choosing a longer range for the repulsion could lead to ordered distribution of particles on the surface of the droplets .",
    "furthermore the strength of dipolar interactions , neglected in our present model , could be relevant .",
    "after the complete evaporation of the droplets we find stable clusters that range from sphere doublets to complex polyhedra .",
    "the structures and size distributions found in simulations matched those found in experiments .",
    "histograms show that larger clusters can be obtained by increasing the initial size of the droplets or by increasing the density of colloidal particles at the expense of a smaller yield for smaller clusters in accordance with the results of  @xcite .",
    "the bond number was used to distinguish different structures with the same number of constituent particles .",
    "we found that although the aoy potential gives the same clusters and size distributions as the swy potential , the aoy interaction results in a larger number of possible structures than the swy interaction .",
    "in particular , the aoy potential gives structures with a smaller number of bonds , i.e. with more open structure .",
    "this is intuitively reasonable , since the steep attractive part of the aoy potential results in a difficult equilibration of the geometric structure of the clusters .",
    "although these potentials do not model quantitatively our experimental system , this study can give an indication of what type of interactions one should use in order to change the cluster morphology to more open ( softer ) clusters .",
    "our simple model reproduces the experimental results accurately despite a lack of realistic energy or time scales .",
    "it is therefore sensible to assume that the model captures the essential physics of the assembly process and that more complex assembly processes can be studied with a certain confidence .",
    "hence , the model can be useful to guide experimental work .",
    "as an example we applied the theoretical model to a fluid mixture of tetrahedra clusters and droplets .",
    "the computer simulations show that the assembly process via emulsion droplet evaporation can lead to stable superclusters with two , three and four tetrahedral building blocks .",
    "these novel structures are not found in the assembly of single nanoparticles and could represent a step in the direction of novel and complex mesoscale materials .",
    "we neglected in our theoretical model the formation of dipole moments for particles trapped at the droplet surface . including dipolar interactions and increasing the range of the repulsion both constitute interesting steps beyond the current work .",
    "furthermore , using our present model for studying gelation , as was recently reported in colloidal dispersions with a small immiscible liquid  @xcite , could be interesting .",
