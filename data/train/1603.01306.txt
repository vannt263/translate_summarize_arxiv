    "we shall assume @xmath22 .",
    "the functions @xmath19 are natural to study for a few reasons .",
    "the most basic motivation comes from the fact that @xmath19 are ( arguably ) the easiest cusp forms to construct explicitly . in constrast ,",
    "the hecke eigenforms are rather more difficult to construct for large weights .",
    "a more advanced motivation comes from the quantum unique ergodicity ( que ) conjecture of rudnick and sarnak @xcite , which is an equidistribution statement for hecke - maass cusp forms of large laplace eigenvalue and for holomorphic hecke cusp forms of large weight .",
    "holowinsky and soundararajan @xcite have proven que for holomorphic forms .",
    "meanwhile , que for maass forms was proved by lindenstrauss @xcite and soundararajan @xcite .",
    "in fact , in an even earlier paper , luo and sarnak @xcite proved que for eisenstein series in the spectral aspect .",
    "one may wonder if there is an analog of que for large weight eisenstein series .",
    "of course , @xmath23 is not a cusp form , so it is natural to project this form onto the cuspidal subspace , which is precisely @xmath24 .",
    "it is an obvious generalization to examine @xmath19 for general @xmath25 .",
    "many authors have studied the zeros of modular forms , including @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite .",
    "in general we are interested in how these cusp forms @xmath19 behave . on the one hand",
    ", one may expect that @xmath19 has similar properties as a random linear combination of hecke cusp forms of weight @xmath2 .",
    "if so , then one would expect that its zeros would equidistribute in the funamental domain as the zeros of hecke cusp forms do , due to work of rudnick @xcite and holowinsky and soundararajan @xcite .",
    "in constrast to this naive guess , we have    [ conj : mainconj ] all the zeros of @xmath19 lying in the standard fundamental domain are on the boundary , @xmath4 or @xmath26 .",
    "this conjecture was born out of numerical evidence for @xmath27 .",
    "our main result in this paper proves the conjecture for @xmath1 sufficiently large .",
    "[ thm : mainthmallzerosonboundary ] there exists an effective constant @xmath28 so that if @xmath29 , then all the zeros of @xmath30 in @xmath14 lie on its boundary .",
    "the zeros naturally split up into those on the arc , with @xmath4 , and those on the sides , with @xmath31 ( there may also be `` trivial '' zeros at @xmath32 and @xmath33 which are guaranteed by the valence formula depending on the value of @xmath2 modulo @xmath34 , which we do not count in this dicussion ) .",
    "one of the curious features of the functions @xmath19 is that the relative proportion of zeros on the arc and on the sides depends strongly on the relative sizes of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in particular , in one extreme direction if @xmath35 then it appears all the zeros are on the sides . in the opposite extreme ,",
    "if @xmath36 and @xmath37 , then all the zeros are apparently on the arc .",
    "given @xmath0 and @xmath1 , define @xmath38 to be the number of zeros of @xmath30 on the arc @xmath39 , and @xmath40 to be the number of zeros on the side @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "the number of zeros of a weight @xmath2 modular form is dictated by the valence formula : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the orders of vanishing of @xmath46 at @xmath33 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "thus , conjecture [ conj : mainconj ] is equivalent to the formula @xmath48 where the term @xmath49 accounts for the zero at @xmath11 .",
    "let us agree to call the zeros at @xmath33 , @xmath32 , and @xmath11 guaranteed to exist by the valence formula the trivial zeros , and the rest of the zeros the nontrivial zeros .",
    "[ conj : allzerosonarc ] for @xmath50 , all of the zeros of @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 in the fundamental domain lie on the arc @xmath54 .",

    "these special cases exemplify a more general pattern that when @xmath61 is large , @xmath30 tends to have more zeros on the arc , while when @xmath62 is small , @xmath30 tends to have more zeros on the sides .    in this paper",
    ", we shall produce tight bounds on the sizes of @xmath38 and @xmath40 , culminating in exact formulas for these quantities .",
    "since the formulas are somewhat complicated and break into cases , we shall proceed in stages , giving more accurate estimates as we go .    as a starting point , we state the following    [ prop : crudeequality ] for @xmath63 , we have @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , where the implied constants are absolute ( that is , uniform in @xmath25 ) .",
    "since the total number of zeros of a weight @xmath2 modular form is @xmath66 , proposition [ prop : crudeequality ] shows that all but a bounded number of zeros of @xmath30 are on the boundary .",
    "it is much more difficult to show all the zeros of @xmath30 are on the boundary .",
    "our method of proof shows the ostensibly weaker lower bounds @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , but once these lower bounds are established , the corresponding upper bounds follow by .",
    "we also have the following explicit lower bounds .",
    "[ prop : akllowerbound ] suppose @xmath63 , and @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",

    "then @xmath74 , where @xmath75    propositions [ prop : akllowerbound ] and [ prop : bkllowerboundasymptotic ] , together with , immediately imply proposition [ prop : crudeequality ] .    in a handful of cases , the lower bounds in propositions [ prop : akllowerbound ] and",
    "[ prop : bkllowerboundasymptotic ] may be elevated to equalities .",
    "if @xmath76 and @xmath77 , then propositions [ prop : akllowerbound ] and [ prop : bkllowerboundasymptotic ] give @xmath78 .",
    "on the other hand , the valence formula gives @xmath79 if @xmath80 and @xmath77 , this simplifies as @xmath81 furthermore , the valence formula implies @xmath82 and @xmath83 , and thus @xmath84 .",
    "the only way this upper bound is consistent with the lower bounds is if @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "a similar argument works for @xmath87 .",
    "however , in many cases , propositions [ prop : akllowerbound ] and [ prop : bkllowerboundasymptotic ] are off by one or two zeros , as will be seen with the aid of tables [ table : aklchart ] and [ table : bklchart ] .",

    "the difficulty is that @xmath0 needs to be large enough for the value of @xmath40 to stabilize ; in the case of @xmath38 the lower bound in theorem [ thm : akvalue ] is true , but not always sharp , except if @xmath0 is large .",
    "the size of @xmath0 required turns out to depend on @xmath89 , and on @xmath90 . towards this end , we define the following function .",

    "@xmath93 stands for  stablization point , \" and is intended to represent how large @xmath0 needs to be compared to @xmath1 for the values of @xmath38 and @xmath40 to stabilize to their limiting behaviors .",

    "then @xmath94 , provided @xmath95 , where @xmath96    as an example to illustrate theorem [ thm : bkvalue ] , note that when @xmath97 , table [ table : bklchart ] indicates that the value of @xmath40 perhaps stablizes at @xmath98 ( but certainly not at @xmath99 ) . for comparison , we have @xmath100 , so indeed @xmath101 is where the value stablizes in this example . as another example , numerical calculations indicate @xmath102 and @xmath103 ; here @xmath104 , and @xmath105 .",
    "we have @xmath106 , which is in agreement with the theorem .    from theorems [ thm : akvalue ] and",
    "[ thm : bkvalue ] , we deduce    [ coro : aklplusbkltableofvalues ] suppose @xmath29 , @xmath107 with @xmath108 , and @xmath95 .",
    "then @xmath109 is bounded from below by the following table of values : @xmath110    one can check by a tedious but straightforward calculation that agrees with @xmath111 , except when @xmath112 , in which case it equals @xmath113 .",
    "this is precisely the number of nontrivial zeros of a cusp form of weight @xmath2 .",
    "it may be worth mentioning that this calculation does not require @xmath70 ; the only possible caveat is that when the table gives a negative value , that implies @xmath114 , which are degenerate situations that we are avoiding anyway .",
    "therefore , we deduce    [ coro : allzerosonboundary ] suppose @xmath29 , @xmath107 with @xmath108 , and @xmath95 . then all the zeros of @xmath30 in the standard fundamental domain lie on the boundary .",
    "furthermore , the lower bounds on @xmath38 and @xmath40 given in theorems [ thm : akvalue ] and [ thm : bkvalue ] are equalities , that is , @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "when @xmath117 , then there is still one unaccounted for zero of @xmath30 .",
    "for this , we have    suppose that @xmath118 , and @xmath107 with @xmath70 . then @xmath119 .",
    "this provides the final missing zero , and shows that if @xmath120 , then all the zeros of @xmath30 in @xmath14 lie on the boundary , provided @xmath121 with @xmath70 .",
    "the cases with @xmath122 are covered by proposition [ prop : nozerosonarc ] .",
    "altogether , the subsidiary results described above combine to give theorem [ thm : mainthmallzerosonboundary ] .    rudnick ( * ? ? ? * theorem 2 ) showed that if a family of cusp forms @xmath123 satisfies que , then the zeros of the @xmath123 become equidistributed in @xmath14 .",
    "our results on the zeros here then show that @xmath19 do not satisfy que as @xmath124 .",
    "it could be interesting to show directly that @xmath30 have escape of mass ( if true ) .",
    "the assumption that @xmath120 in the above results is intended to simplify and shorten the proofs throughout this paper .",
    "a value of @xmath28 could certainly be calculated with more work , but it is unlikely that @xmath36 ( for instance ) would be covered by this method .",

    "for any particular value of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , a computer can calculate @xmath38 and @xmath40 , so it seems feasible that conjecture [ conj : mainconj ] could be proved using this strategy .",
    "it is also interesting to study the finer distribution of the zeros of @xmath30 .",
    "our work in this paper shows that @xmath30 has a zero on the arc in each interval of the form @xmath126 , provided @xmath127 , except possibly for a bounded number of zeros near @xmath128 . from this",

    "our work here follows the same general method of approximating @xmath30 and evaluating it at a collection of sample points .",

    "the problem now is that the range with @xmath158 is not covered by these two types of approximations .",
    "we have been able to cover this range by the approximation @xmath159 , with the sum over @xmath160 being a small error term .",
