    "in a recent paper @xcite , a method for the spectral analysis of a certain class of semi - infinite jacobi matrices based on the so - called characteristic function was developed .",
    "the spectral analysis of semi - infinite jacobi matrices is intimately related to classical branches of analysis such as orthogonal polynomials , moment problems , and continued fractions .",
    "there are many monographs that have focused on this , see @xcite for several examples . on the other hand , the spectral theory of doubly infinite jacobi matrices does not appear as often ; a nice exposition of this theory can be found in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chap .  7 ) .",
    "some aspects of the spectral theory of the doubly and semi - infinite jacobi matrices are quite similar ( one may consult , for example , @xcite ) ; however , some are different .",
    "the main difference is the fact that , in the case of doubly infinite matrices , the space of the solutions to the corresponding second - order difference equation is two - dimensional .",
    "the main aim of this article is twofold .",
    "first , in analogy with the semi - infinite case treated in  @xcite , we introduce the characteristic function associated with the doubly infinite jacobi matrix @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 for all @xmath3 .",
    "we also show how the characteristic function can be used to analyze spectral properties of a linear operator acting on @xmath4 whose matrix representation with respect to the standard basis of @xmath4 coincides with @xmath5 .",
    "second , we extend the method by proving a result concerning the algebraic multiplicity of eigenvalues and generalized eigenvectors .    the subclass of matrices @xmath5 for which the characteristic function is well defined is determined by a simple convergence condition imposed on @xmath6 and @xmath7 , see .",
    "the self - adjointness of an operator associated with @xmath5 is not essential for the presented method ; therefore , we treat the matrix @xmath5 with complex entries , which might be of interest from the point of view of the spectral theory of non - self - adjoint operators - a currently very active and rapidly developing field @xcite .",
    "the main results of this paper are stated in theorems  [ thm : main ] and  [ thm : multiplicity ] .    in more detail ,",
    "we show ( under a mild assumption additional to the essential convergence condition ) that the matrix @xmath5 uniquely determines a densely defined closed ( jacobi ) operator @xmath8 whose spectral properties are related to the properties of the corresponding characteristic function .",
    "namely , by being restricted to a certain subset of @xmath9 , the spectrum of @xmath8 in this set is discrete and coincides with the set of zeros of the characteristic function .",
    "further , we provide formulas for eigenvectors , a summation formula for the entries of an eigenvector and an expression for the entries of the matrix representation of the resolvent operator . these results are worked out within section  [ sec : char_func ] and represent a doubly infinite analog to the corresponding results derived in  @xcite for the case of semi - infinite jacobi matrices .",
    "section [ sec : multiplicity ] is devoted to the connection between the order of zeros of the characteristic function and the algebraic multiplicity of the corresponding jacobi operator s eigenvalues .",
    "in addition , we provide formulas for basis vectors of generalized eigenspaces .",
    "these results are of particular interest when questions on diagonalization of non - self - adjoint jacobi operators are examined .    in section [ sec : diag_reg ] , we impose some additional conditions on the diagonal sequence of @xmath5 , which allows us to remove singularities of the characteristic function , with possibly one exception located at the origin , and introduce a regularized characteristic function . according to the type of the additional condition",
    ", we distinguish 3 different cases and illustrate the respective results on concrete examples .",
    "moreover , in 2 cases concerning either a compact operator or an operator with compact resolvent , we indicate a connection between the regularized characteristic function and the theory of regularized determinants .",
    "in this section , we introduce the characteristic function associated with the doubly infinite jacobi matrix   and derive spectral results similar to those obtained in  @xcite .",
    "where the verification of a result is completely analogous to the corresponding one given in  @xcite for the semi - infinite matrix , the proof is only indicated for the sake of brevity .      the main algebraic tool for the definition of the characteristic function is a function called @xmath10 which appeared in @xcite for the first time .",

    "this function will be called the characteristic function associated with the doubly infinite jacobi matrix @xmath5 since it plays a similar role to the characteristic polynomial in linear algebra , as it will be further demonstrated .    first ,",
