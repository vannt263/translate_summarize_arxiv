    "a matching in a graph with @xmath0 vertices is a set of edges , where no two edges are incident to a common vertex .",
    "a maximum matching is a matching of maximum cardinality , with a perfect matching being a particular case containing @xmath1 edges .",
    "the size and number of maximum matchings have numerous applications in physics  @xcite , chemistry  @xcite , computer science  @xcite , among others .",
    "for example , in the context of structural controllability  @xcite , the minimum number of driving vertices to control the whole network and the possible configurations of driving vertices are closely related to the size and number of maximum matchings in a bipartite graph .    due to the relevance of diverse aspects , it is of theoretical and practical importance to study the size and number of maximum matchings in networks , which is , however , computationally intractable  @xcite .",
    "valiant proved that enumerating perfect matchings in general graphs is formidable  @xcite , it is # p - complete even in bipartite graph  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is of great interest to find specific graphs for which the maximum matching problem can be solved exactly  @xcite .",
    "in the past decades , the problems related maximum matchings have attracted considerable attention from the community of mathematics and theoretical computer science  @xcite .    a vast majority of previous works about maximum matchings focused on regular graphs or random graphs  @xcite , which can not well describe realistic networks . extensive empirical works  @xcite indicated that most real networks exhibit the prominent scale - free property  @xcite , with their degree distribution following a power law form .",
    "it has been shown that power law behavior has a strong effect on the properties of maximum matchings in a scale - free network  @xcite .",
    "for example , in the barabsi - albert ( ba ) scale - free network  @xcite , a perfect matching is almost sure not to exist , and the size of a maximum matching is much less than half the number of vertices .",
    "the same phenomenon was also observed in a lot of real scale - free networks , which are far from being perfectly matched as the ba network .",
    "then , an interesting question arises naturally : whether the power - law degree distribution is the only ingredient characterizing maximum matchings in scale - free networks ?    in order to answer the above - raised problem , in this paper , we present an analytical study of maximum matchings in two scale - free networks with identical degree distribution  @xcite , and show that the first network has no perfect matchings , while the second network has many . for the first network , we derive an exact expression for the size of maximum matchings , and provide a recursive solution to the number of maximum matchings . for the second network , by employing the pfaffian method proposed independently by kasteleyn  @xcite , fisher and temperley  @xcite",
    ", we construct a pfaffian orientation of the network . on the basis of pfaffian orientation , we determine the number of perfect matchings as well as its entropy , which is proved equal to that corresponding to the extended sierpiski graph  @xcite .",
    "our findings suggest that the power - law degree distribution by itself can not determine the properties of maximum matchings in scale - free networks .",
    "in this section , we introduce some useful notations and results that will be applied in the sequel .",
    "let @xmath2 be a graph with @xmath0 vertices and @xmath3 edges , where @xmath4 is the vertex set @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the edge set . in this paper ,",
    "all graphs considered are simple graphs without loops and parallel edges , having an even number of vertices . throughout the paper ,",
    "the two terms graph and network are used indistinctly .",
    "let @xmath7 be an edge in @xmath8 .",
    "we say that the edge @xmath9 is subdivided if we insert a new vertex @xmath10 between them , that is , edge @xmath9 is replaced by a path @xmath11 of length @xmath12 .",
    "the subdivision graph @xmath13 of a graph @xmath8 is the graph obtaining from @xmath8 by performing the subdivision operation on each edge in @xmath6 .",
    "the line graph @xmath14 of a graph @xmath8 is the graph , where the vertex set is exactly the edge set @xmath6 of @xmath8 , and two vertices are adjacent if and only if their corresponding edges of @xmath8 are connected to a common vertex in @xmath4 .",
    "the subdivided - line graph @xmath15 of a graph @xmath8 is the line graph of the subdivision graph of @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath16 .",
    "we call @xmath17 the subdivided - line graph operation .",
    "the @xmath18-iterated ( @xmath19 ) subdivided - line graph @xmath20 of @xmath8 is the graph obtained from @xmath8 by iteratively using the subdivided - line graph operation @xmath18 times .      for a network ,",
    "the distance between two vertices is defined as the number of edges in the shortest path between them , and the average distance of the network is defined as the arithmetic average of distances over all pairs of vertices .",
    "the diameter of a network is the length of the shortest path between any pair of farthermost vertices in the network .",
    "a network is said to be small - world  @xcite if its average distance grows logarithmically with the number of vertices , or more slowly .",
    "a random variable @xmath21 is said to follow a power law distribution if its probability density function @xmath22 obeys the form @xmath23 .",
    "a network is scale - free  @xcite if its degree satisfies , at least asymptotically , a power law distribution @xmath24 . in realistic scale - free networks",
    "@xcite , the power exponent @xmath25 of degree distribution typically lies between @xmath12 and @xmath26 .",
    "cumulative degree distribution @xmath27 of a network is defined as @xmath28 . for a scale - free network with power law degree distribution @xmath29 ,",
    "its cumulative degree distribution is also power law @xmath30  @xcite . in real networks",
    "there are nontrivial degree correlations among vertices  @xcite .",
    "there are two measures characterizing degree correlations in a network .",
    "the first one is the average degree of the nearest neighbors for vertices with degree @xmath31 as a function of this degree value , denoted as @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath32 is an increasing function of @xmath31 , it means that vertices have a tendency to connect to vertices with a similar or larger degree . in this case",
    ", the network is called assortative .",
    "for example , the small - world farey graph  @xcite is assortative .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath32 is a decreasing function of @xmath31 , which implies that vertices of large degree are likely to be connected to vertices with small degree , then the network is said to be disassortative . and if @xmath33 , the network is uncorrelated .",
    "the other quantity describing degree correlations is pearson correlation coefficient of the degrees of the endvertices of all edges  @xcite . for a general graph @xmath2 , this coefficient",
    "is defined as @xmath34 ^ 2 } { e \\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^e \\frac{1}{2 } \\left(j_i^2 + k_i^2\\right ) -\\left [ \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^e \\frac{1}{2}(j_i+ k_i)\\right]^2 } \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath35 , @xmath36 are the degrees of the two endvertices of the @xmath37th edge , with @xmath38 .",
    "the pearson correlation coefficient is in the range @xmath39 .",

    "we use boxes of size @xmath43 to cover all vertices in @xmath8 , and let @xmath44 be minimum possible number of boxes required to cover all vertices in @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath44 satisfies @xmath45 with @xmath46 , then @xmath8 is fractal with its fractal dimension being @xmath47 .",
    "self - similarity of a network  @xcite refers to the scale invariance of the degree distribution under coarse - graining with various box sizes @xmath43 as well as under the iterative operations of coarse - graining with fixed @xmath43 .",
    "intuitively , a self - similar network resembles a part of itself .",
    "notice that fractality and self - similarity do not always imply each other .",
    "a fractal network is self - similar , while a self - similar network may be not fractal .",
    "a matching in @xmath8 is a subset @xmath48 such that no two edges in @xmath49 have a vertex in common .",

    "similarly , a path @xmath55 of @xmath8 is nice if @xmath56 includes a perfect matching .",
