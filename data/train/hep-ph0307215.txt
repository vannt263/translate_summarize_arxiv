    "<S> recently obtained nnlo exact corrections for higgs and pseudoscalar higgs boson production in hadron colliders are compared with approximate ones . </S>",

    "<S> + _ panepistimiopolis , athens 15771 , greece _    some time ago it was argued that for processes involving structure functions and/or fragmentation functions , over a range of a proper kinematic variable @xmath2 , there is a part that dominates the next- to leading order ( nlo ) correction and that this part contains the distributions @xmath3 and @xmath4_+$ ] @xmath5 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently this argument was extended to the then existing next- to- next- to leading order ( nnlo ) calculations , namely drell- yan ( d - y ) production of lepton pairs ( @xmath6 ) and deep inelastic structure ( dis ) functions ( @xmath7 ) @xcite .    in the meantime two more processes have been calculated in nnlo : higgs boson production in hadron- hadron collisions ( @xmath8 ) @xcite and neutral pseudoscalar higgs boson production in hadron- hadron collisions ( @xmath9 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , it would be important to see whether the procedures developed in @xcite apply also to higgs and pseudoscalar higgs boson production as well .    in the calculation of higgs boson production in hadron- </S>",
    "<S> hadron collisions to leading order ( lo ) @xcite and to nlo @xcite no approximations of the higgs- two gluon vertex are necessary . </S>",
    "<S> this vertex is dominated by the top quark , which is known to have a mass @xmath10 much greater than that of the other quarks . </S>",
    "<S> however , the nnlo calculation was possible only in the limit of the higgs mass @xmath11 @xmath12 in this limit the top - quark loops are replaced by point - like vertices and the corresponding effective lagrangian @xcite is known to provide a satisfactory description of the cross section for a higgs boson at nlo @xcite .    in the calculation of the pseudoscalar higgs boson production </S>",
    "<S> the situation is more complicated . </S>",
    "<S> the higgs boson sector of the minimal supersymmetric standard model consists of two complex higgs doublets . </S>",
    "<S> thus , apart from the mass of the neutral pseudoscalar higgs boson @xmath13 , the ratio of the vacum expectation values of the two higgs doublets @xmath14 also enters . the calculation of @xcite is valid for small and moderate values of @xmath15 ; only then the @xmath16 is dominated by a top - quark loop . </S>",
    "<S> then , for @xmath17 the interaction of the pseudoscalar higgs boson can be described by an effective lagrangian @xcite .    in our approach </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the proper variable is proportional to @xmath18 ( or @xmath19 ) , where @xmath20 is the total c.m . </S>",
    "<S> energy of the initial hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> our approach requires inclusion of the region @xmath21 large ( inclusion of @xmath21 near 1 ) . since experiment excludes values of @xmath11 ( or @xmath13 ) @xmath22 gev , we have to consider @xmath20 well exceeding this value . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , inclusion of @xmath23 tev would require @xmath11 ( or @xmath13 ) well exceeding 1 tev , which would render questionable the field- theoretic approach . </S>",
    "<S> we then have considered a nominal energy of @xmath24 gev . clearly , for @xmath11 ( or @xmath13 ) </S>",
    "<S> @xmath25 gev the inequality ( 1 ) ( or ( 2 ) ) is violated and the whole results of @xcite and @xcite , which we use , should be considered as just providing a mathematical model , where the approach of @xcite can be tested . </S>",
    "<S> +   + we begin with @xmath26 ( or @xmath27 ) mediated via the subprocess @xmath28 and we consider the cross- section @xmath29 where @xmath30 denote @xmath31 ( or @xmath32 ) and @xmath33 is the standard distribution of gluons inside the @xmath34 ( or @xmath35 ) . using dimensional analysis </S>",
    "<S> we write the partonic cross- section in terms of the dimensionless variable @xmath36 and after factoring the collinear singularities ( usually in the @xmath37 scheme ) we end up with the following expression @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the standard convolution defined as @xmath40(\\tau ) = \\int\\limits_0 ^ 1 { dx_1 dx_2 f_1 ( x_1 ) f_2 ( x_2 ) \\delta ( \\tau   - x_1 x_2 ) } .\\ ] ] the partonic cross- section @xmath41 is given by the following perturbation expansion @xmath42\\ ] ] where the functions @xmath43 , @xmath44 , are given in eqs . ( 44 ) , ( 45 ) , ( 47 ) , ( 48 ) and ( 49 ) of @xcite , and @xmath45 with @xmath46 gev the higgs vacum expectation value . </S>",
    "<S> +   + subsequently we proceed as in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we write , for simplicity , @xmath47 and denote by @xmath48 , @xmath44 , the @xmath49 part of @xmath50 , by @xmath51 the part of @xmath52 arising from distributions @xmath53 and @xmath54_+$ ] , here @xmath55 ( virtual , collinear and soft gluons ) and by @xmath56 the rest . </S>",
    "<S> we also define @xmath57 in the subsequent calculations we use @xmath58 flavors and fix the renormalization and factorization scales at @xmath59 . for the gluon distributions we use the updated @xmath37 cteq5m1 set of @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . 1 , upper part </S>",
    "<S> , shows @xmath60 , @xmath61 , as functions of @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath63 , while for relatively small @xmath62 is significant , for @xmath64 is below 30% . </S>",
    "<S> as for @xmath65 , for @xmath66 is smaller than 20% . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , both @xmath60 decrease fast as @xmath62 increases towards 1 .    as in @xcite , it is of interest to see the precentage of @xmath56 of the total cross section determined up to @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> fig . 1 , upper part </S>",
    "<S> , also shows the ratios @xmath67 and @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the former is below 31% and the latter below 15% for all @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> again , both ratios decrease fast as @xmath62 increase . </S>",
    "<S> +   + now we turn to the calculation of the pseudoscalar higgs boson production and consider @xmath69 ( or @xmath70 ) mediated via the subprocess @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> as before , the partonic cross - sections @xmath41 have an expansion similar to ( 7 ) @xmath71\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is given by ( 4 ) with @xmath19 , @xmath73 are given in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 8)-(11 ) of @xcite ( together with the expressions of @xmath74 ) , and here @xmath75 </S>",
    "<S> now we write @xmath76 and , as before , denote by @xmath77 the @xmath49 part of @xmath78 , by @xmath79 the part of @xmath80 arising from distributions and by @xmath81 the rest . </S>",
    "<S> we define @xmath82 and fix the renormalization and factorization scales at @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> again , for the gluon distributions we use the set cteq5m1 set of @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 , lower part , shows @xmath84 , @xmath61 , as functions of @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> all the results are similar as for @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> similar are also the results for the ratios @xmath85 and @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> +   + we note the following : suppose that in @xmath51 and @xmath79 , apart from the terms arising from the distributions @xmath53 and @xmath54_+$ ] we include also the terms @xmath87 , @xmath88 . defining as @xmath51 and @xmath81 the rest , we find that the ratios @xmath89 and @xmath90 decrease significantly in magnitude over the entire range of @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> of course , the same holds for the ratios @xmath67 , @xmath68 and the corresponding ratios with h replaced by a. + note also that ref.@xcite has obtained numerical results very similar to @xcite and @xcite by expanding the phase - space integrals around the kinematic point @xmath91 , where @xmath18 or @xmath19 , and keeping a number of terms . </S>",
    "<S> although the first paper of [ 11 ] was published before [ 3 ] , we prefer the methods of [ 3 ] as they avoid expansions . +   + finally , in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , upper part , we present the total cross - sections @xmath92 ( dashed line ) and @xmath93 ( solid line ) . </S>",
    "<S> what is important is that as @xmath62 increases towards 1 both cross - sections approach each other , and for @xmath94 practically coincide . </S>",
    "<S> the same is observed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , lower part , which shows the quantities @xmath95 ( dashed ) and @xmath96 ( solid ) . </S>",
    "<S> +   + in conclusion , under the assumptions discussed at the beginning , we have shown that not only in d - y production and dis @xcite , but also in higgs and pseudoscalar higgs boson production ( @xmath28 and @xmath16 ) there is a part containing the distributions @xmath53 and @xmath54_+$ ] , here @xmath55 ( virtual , soft and collinear part ) that for @xmath62(@xmath97 or @xmath98 ) not too small dominates the nlo and nnlo correction . </S>",
    "<S> this part is determined much easier than the nlo and in particular the nnlo correction . </S>",
    "<S> of course , as it was stressed in @xcite , this part should not be restricted to too small a region near 1 , for threshhold resummation @xcite becomes very important . </S>",
    "<S> +   + note added + after the completion of this article , the paper by v. ravindran , j. smith and w. van neerven , hep - ph/0302335 , appeared , confirming the results of [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] and [ 11 ] by a different method . </S>"
