    "the cosmological scenario that has emerged in the last decade indicates that we live in a universe which is almost spatially flat , as indicated by the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) experiments @xcite .",
    "we have also learned from observations @xcite that its energy content is comprised by around 4@xmath0 of baryons , and 26@xmath0 of cold dark matter @xcite , both clumped in galaxies and clusters of galaxies .",
    "the remaining 70@xmath0 of its energy is homogeneously distributed in the universe and is causing its observed acceleration @xcite , a component that was generically dubbed dark energy @xcite .",
    "this recipe for the universe gives rise to what became known as the _ cosmic coincidence problem _ : why are dark energy and dark matter energy densities of the same order of magnitude in the present epoch ?",
    "this problem arises because dark energy must have a negative pressure to accelerate the universe , and cold dark matter ( as well as baryons ) has vanishing pressure .",
    "therefore , the ratio of their energy densities @xmath1 , for a constant equation of state @xmath2 of dark energy , must vary as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the redshift , @xmath5 denotes ( barionic plus cold dark ) matter , @xmath6 denotes the dark energy field , and the index 0 indicates the present value of a quantity .",
    "several dark energy candidates have been proposed , from the most obvious , the cosmological constant @xcite , to modifications of gravity @xcite . following the inflationary idea , `` regular '' scalar fields ,",
    "the so - called quintessence models , noncoupled @xcite and coupled @xcite to dark matter content , were also proposed to be the cause of the acceleration , as well as fluids that do not obey the weak energy condition @xcite , scalar fields with non - canonical kinetic terms @xcite and tachyonic fields @xcite , just to cite a few examples .",
    "these two last models have an advantage with respect to others in what concerns the coincidence , in the sense that the equation of state of the field changes to a cosmological constant - like as the background changes from radiation to matter domination , but apparently they have a very small parameter space that can generate relevant cosmological solutions @xcite .    in this sense , what models do , in general , is to fine tune the overall scale of the potential of dark energy ( or the scale in which modifications of general relativity become important ) to be of order of the present critical density , @xmath7 gev@xmath8 , where @xmath9 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 is the hubble constant , @xmath11 @xcite , and @xmath12 gev is the reduced planck mass .",
    "this fine tuning emerges even when one is using tracking or scaling @xcite properties of some potentials , like the exponential potential @xcite we will focus on in this letter . in this sense , we have recently showed @xcite that coupling dark energy with dark matter also does not solve the problem , since one has to adjust the value of the potential in very much the same way one does for the uncoupled quintessence .",
    "another general assumption when one is modelling dark energy is that the universe is flat , that is , curvature effects can be neglected .",
    "the friedmann equation in this case becomes @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the cosmic scale factor , dot indicates derivatives with respect to cosmic time @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is related to the curvature via robertson - walker metric ( + 1 , 0 or -1 for a closed , flat or open universe , respectively ) .",
    "@xmath17 is the hubble parameter , which present value is the hubble constant , and r denotes the radiation component .",
    "this equation can then be rewritten as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 are the density parameters , and we have defined @xmath20 .",
    "the energy densities are given by the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor for each component separately , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the lagrangian of the scalar field is the usual one , @xmath25 , and consequently , for a homogeneous perfect fluid , the equation of state of dark energy is @xmath26 .",
    "the flatness of the universe is one of the main predictions of inflation @xcite , since during an inflationary period @xmath27 vanishes quasi - exponentially .",
    "however , recently some interest has been given to the possibility that the spatial curvature of the universe be non - negligible @xcite , both for theoretical ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) and observational @xcite reasons . a positive spatial curvature plus a cosmological constant could , for instance , mimic a phantom regime @xcite .",
    "another interesting point is that cmb experiments @xcite , even when combined with different astronomical data @xcite , present a tendency for some small positive spatial curvature of the universe , result that can be checked soon using other observations @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we explore the possibility that the universe has a global positive spatial curvature in the context of a quintessence model .",
    "as we will show , if the potential is dependent on the curvature , there is no coincidence in the fact that the transition from a matter dominated universe to a dark energy dominated universe is happening currently , as well as the fact that the dark energy field behaves almost like a cosmological constant .",
    "instead , they are a consequence of the fact the curvature is becoming important in the present epoch",
    ". it should be clear , however , we do not intend explaining why the curvature is becoming important right now . if observations really rule out flat models someday ( what for sure is not the case today ) , this fact would be a different coincidence problem , the old flatness problem .",
    "we adopt here the approach of checking what kind of solutions one could obtain if observations indicate a non - flat universe .",
    "once the dark energy attractor regime is reached , after being triggered by the curvature , the universe accelerates forever , and the curvature again become negligible , in a kind of self - flattening process . in the following section we describe the model , stressing its phenomenological nature .",
    "we then present an analytical solution for the model , discuss its main properties , and possible variants of it .",
    "finally , in the conclusions some realistic scenarios in which those models could arise are briefly discussed .",
    "the models presented here are based on the assumptions that the universe presents a small positive curvature , and that the quintessential potential depends linearly on it , that is , @xmath28 where the negative sign comes from the fact @xmath27 is negative for a closed universe , that is what we consider in what follows . since the `` curvature density '' obeys the fluid - like equation , , not from the conservation of a stress - energy tensor , like the other fluids .",
    "] we can write @xmath29 , where @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "based on the conditions , we will see that it is possible to explain the current cosmological scenario with natural values for the only parameter of the potential , @xmath32 , without fine tuning .",
    "it should be clear that such a dependence on the curvature is phenomenological , although in the last section we point out some contexts in which it may arise . in this section , however , we are interested in verifying what kind of solutions one could obtain when such dependence is present .",
    "notice also that modifying the exponential potential is not something new in the literature @xcite , although the dependence on the curvature is .",
    "the scalar field equation can then be written as @xmath33 where prime denotes derivatives with respect to @xmath34 , and the hubble term , equation ( [ eq : friedmann ] ) , is given by @xmath35",
    "the set of equations ( [ eq : sf ] ) and ( [ eq : hubble ] ) can then be solved numerically .",
    "it will reach a scaling solution @xcite , and therefore the final solutions are almost independent of the initial conditions .",
    "the results for the density parameters of the components of the universe for a typical solution are shown in the top panel of figure [ fig : omegas ] .",
    "( color online ) _ top panel _ : density parameters of the components of the universe as a function of @xmath36 for a typical solution ( here , @xmath37 ) .",
    "notice the transition to a dark energy dominated phase is happening by now , but on the contrary to other models of quintessence , this is due to the fact the universe is non - flat , and not to a fine tuning in the parameters.the upper solid curve indicated by total corresponds to @xmath38 .",
    "_ bottom panel _ : equation of state of the dark energy .",
    "dashed curve shows the scaling value , equation ( [ eq : eos ] ) . ]    notice that the transition to the scaling regime is happening around the present epoch , but differently of all models of dark energy , there is no fine tuning in the overall scale of the potential . instead",
    ", the transition is triggered by the fact that curvature is becoming important currently .",
    "the system then reaches the accelerating scaling solution , as can be seen in the bottom panel of the same figure , and when this happens the curvature again becomes negligible .",
    "the scaling solution can be obtained from equations ( [ eq : sf ] ) and ( [ eq : hubble ] ) when one realizes the field will dominate completely the energy density of the universe . since in a scaling solution we have @xmath39 , equation ( [ eq : sf ] ) becomes @xmath40 , which presents a solution , @xmath41 a more complete dynamical analysis will be presented elsewhere .",
    "here , we will focus on this solution , that presents scaling properties , that is , the equation of state of the dark energy field is constant and different from the one of background @xcite .",
    "its value can be obtained using the fact that in the scaling regime both kinetic and potential terms of the scalar field scale in the same way , @xmath42 , and therefore , @xmath43 the behavior of the equation of state for a typical solution is presented in the bottom panel of figure 1 , for @xmath37 . for values of @xmath44 , the dark energy field",
    "practically mimics a cosmological constant .",
    "contrary to what happens in the case of a regular exponential potential @xcite , where a large fine tuning on @xmath32 is needed to obtain @xmath45 , here almost all values of @xmath32 generate acceptable values for the equation of state of dark energy .",
    "in fact , expanding the square root of ( [ eq : eos ] ) for small @xmath46 up to second order , one gets that @xmath47 , from where one can see it really approaches the cosmological constant value as @xmath32 increases .",
    "however , the transition still is happening in the present epoch , as we clearly can see from figure [ fig : omegas ] .",
    "because of that , the scaling values have not yet been reached ( although they almost have ) , and one needs to verify to which values of the curvature reasonable cosmological parameters can be obtained . in what follows , we looked for models with @xmath48 and @xmath49 @xcite .    in order to do that ,",
    "we have solved numerically the system of equations varying @xmath50 in the range @xmath51 $ ] ( @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the hubble constant obtained numerically ) , and @xmath32 in the range @xmath54 $ ] , varying both stepsizes to get better resolution and faster calculation . the results are shown in figure [ fig : eoslamnum ] .",
    "( color online ) _ top panel : _ current dark energy equation of state versus @xmath32 . _ bottom panel : _ current dark energy equation of state versus the modulus of the present spatial curvature .",
    "both figures are for models that satisfy the constraints on @xmath55 and @xmath56 discussed in the text . ]",
    "top panel shows the present value of the equation of state of dark energy versus @xmath32 for models that satisfy the cited constraints .",
    "the values are not exactly the ones given by equation ( [ eq : eos ] ) , since the transition has not been completed , but they are very close .",
    "bottom panel presents the modulus of the spatial curvature today for the allowed models .",
    "a large curvature would imply an equation of state incompatible with observations .",
    "however , curious enough , for values of the curvature within the current errors on its measured value , the field presents an equation of state in agreement with observations .    before concluding ,",
    "it should be pointed out that similar models might be considered , like for instance a modified peebles - ratra potential , @xmath57 , or another variations of the exponential potential like @xmath58 , or @xmath59 , based on a variation of supergravity and supersymmetric models @xcite . besides that",
    ", it might be clear that similar models can be constructed using @xmath60 ( open models ) , although here we have chosen to follow the indications given by the cmb observations .",
    "it is important to stress that the dependence of the potential on the curvature is assumed here , and therefore it is crucial to verify whether it could be obtained in the context of a realistic particle physics model or in a modification of general relativity . in this sense , a particular direction which seems promising",
    "is obtained in the context of models with a scalar field non - minimally coupled to the ricci scalar @xcite . for a friedmann - robertson - walker universe ,",
    "the ricci scalar is given by @xmath61 , and it is conceivable that it does exist a lagrangian which is a combination of non - minimal couplings with the scalar invariants ( like @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , etc . , where @xmath65 are functions of the field @xmath6 and @xmath66 is the so - called gauss - bonnet term ) that can result on a dependence of the potential with the curvature density , but not on @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "if this is the case , the dependence has the form given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pot ] ) .    such kind of terms arise naturally in the extensions of the standard model of particle physics , for instance in effective actions coming from superstring theory @xcite . in string",
    "theory the field @xmath6 correspond to moduli fields ( which generally appears in the form @xmath69 ) , and a combination of the several parameters appearing in such models @xcite also can potentially lead to the kind of cosmological solutions discussed here .    another possible way is obtained in the so - called _ macroscopic gravity approach _ @xcite .",
    "the averaged einstein equations for a spatially _ flat _ , homogenous , and isotropic universe have the form of normal friedmann equations plus a curvature term induced by the gravitational correlations terms .",
    "a comoving observer would therefore measure the universe to be spatially curved . in this way",
    ", a coupling of the scalar field with the correlation tensor could in principle lead to a coupling with a curvature - like term as the one studied here .",
    "this is similar to what happens in the case of the _ regional averaging _ @xcite . in this case , the curvature - like term is generated by a volume effect and by curvature backreaction @xcite .",
    "coupling the scalar field with the new terms of the measured cosmological parameters might also result in a potential like the one given by equation ( [ eq : pot ] ) . these and other possibilities are currently under investigation , and seem very promising to generate realistic models with the properties discussed here .    one should note that , independently on the way the model is generated , the general behavior of the models described here will be mantained .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that its main property ( the fact that the spatial curvature triggers the dark energy dominance ) comes only from the fact that the energy densities of matter , `` curvature '' , and of the potential energy of the dark energy field scales respectively as @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "these scalings are independent of the gravity model , since two of them come only from the conservation of the energy - momentum tensors , and the other one only from the fact the curvature scales as @xmath72 , which is a dimensional argument .",
    "therefore , the conclusions of the present work are expect to hold even for more general theories and modifications of gravity , and should be considered as a possible alternative to understand the coincidences which plague the present cosmological model .",
    "we have presented a phenomenological model of dark energy in which its potential depends on the positive spatial curvature of the universe , assumed to be closed .",
    "the model presents a scaling behavior that is triggered by the fact the curvature is becoming non - negligible around the present epoch , and , in this sense , there is no coincidence in the fact @xmath73 .",
    "is different from zero only recently .",
    "notice that this could be achieved , for instance , using closed inflationary models : see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite and references therein . ]",
    "notice that it is a testable model , since the scenario would lose its appeal if observations indicate @xmath74 is zero with enough accuracy .    in this sense",
    ", an important feature of the model is that values of the spatial curvature that give rise to reasonable cosmological parameters ( like @xmath55 , @xmath75 and @xmath56 ) are within current uncertainties in the observations of @xmath74 . besides that , for all values of @xmath32 sufficiently high ( @xmath76 ) the model behaves almost like a cosmological constant , showing there is no fine tuning on this parameter .",
    "further investigations are needed to check if such a model would still survive to tests from different observations , and more realistic models will allow one to infer different features of such a scenario .",
    "of course it is important to be cautious and to keep in mind that , until now , all the cosmological data are totally compatible with a flat universe which energy density is dominated by the cosmological constant .",
    "that is probably the simplest scenario one can think to current cosmology , ignoring the coincidence .",
    "whether alternatives like the one described here are cosmologically reasonable is something that depends on the forthcoming observations , especially the ones able to probe a possible deviation from flatness on the spatial curvature of universe .",
