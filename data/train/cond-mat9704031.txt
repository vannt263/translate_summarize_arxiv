    "interacting electrons confined to two dimensions and subjected to a strong magnetic field exhibit spectacular phenomena , e.g. , the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) @xcite",
    ". an elegant and succinct qualitative explanation of these phenomena is given in terms of new particles called composite fermions @xcite , which are electrons bound to an even number of vortices of the many body wave function .",
    "the reason for the simplicity of the composite fermion ( cf ) approach is that the strongly correlated liquid of electrons is mapped into a weakly interacting gas of composite fermions , enabling a conventional single - particle description of the fqhe , similar in spirit to that in landau s theory of fermi liquids .",
    "the composite fermions have the same charge , spin and statistics as electrons , but they differ from the electrons in the fundamental non - perturbative aspect that they experience a reduced effective magnetic field , given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the external magnetic field , @xmath3 is the electron ( cf ) density , and @xmath4 is the flux quantum . this is a consequence of a partial cancellation of the aharonov - bohm phases by the phases generated by the vortices on other composite fermions .",
    "the effective filling factor of composite fermions , @xmath5 is therefore given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the filling factor of electrons .",
    "the minus sign corresponds to the case in which @xmath8 and @xmath2 are antiparallel .",
    "the model of weakly interacting composite fermions has explained numerous facts pertaining to the fqhe @xcite , some of which are as follows .",
    "the fractions appear in experiments in certain prominent sequences , given by @xmath9 which are called the principal sequences of fractions .",
    "these correspond in the cf theory to filled landau levels ( lls ) of composite fermions ( @xmath10 ) , i.e. , the fqhe of electrons is thus simply a manifestation of the iqhe of the composite fermions .",
    "the absence of other fractions is related to the scarcity of fqhe in higher lls .",
    "the experimentally determined gaps to charged excitations also depend on @xmath11 roughly in a way expected from modeling them as the cyclotron energy of the composite fermions @xcite .",
    "an interesting limiting case is at @xmath12 , where @xmath8 vanishes .",
    "halperin , lee and read have proposed that the composite fermions exist here as well and form a fermi sea @xcite , which has given rise to numerous new experiments @xcite that detect composite fermions by observing their cyclotron orbits in the vicinity of half filled landau level and provide further nontrivial confirmation of the cf hypothesis .",
    "the cf approach can straightforwardly be extended to include spin as well @xcite , which is of interest since the zeeman energy is quite small in gaas .",
    "_ @xcite have studied in detail the appearance and disappearance of the fractions as a function of the zeeman energy in terms of transitions between incompressible states of various polarizations , originating from a competition between the cyclotron and the zeeman energies of the composite fermions .",
    "thus , the cf theory appears to give a simple and unified description of all the _ liquid _ states of electrons in the lowest ll , incompressible or otherwise .    equally striking",
    "is the success of the microscopic cf theory .",
    "the cf wave functions have been compared to the exact wave functions ( obtained for a finite number of electrons , usually fewer than 10 - 12 , by a brute force numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian in the lowest ll subspace ) in a large number of studies and found to have an overlap of essentially 100% @xcite , which is particularly impressive considering that the cf wave functions have no adjustable parameters for the incompressible fqhe states and their low - energy excitations .",
    "[ in contrast , in studies of _ atoms _ involving jastrow factors , which typically depend on several parameters , typically only 80 to 85% of the correlation energy is obtained correctly . with backflow corrections and by including generalized jastrow factors that account for three - body interactions , the accuracy can be increased to within a few % , but only at the cost of introducing many more adjustable parameters ( see , for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) . ]",
    "therefore , it should in principle be straightforward to make accurate quantitative predictions for the experimentally measurable quantities using the cf wave functions .",
    "unfortunately , in the past , it has not been possible to compute with the cf wave functions for systems containing more than @xmath13 10 composite fermions due to the following technical complication . in the simplest ( unprojected ) form , the cf wave function",
    "have some amplitude in higher electronic lls .",
    "even though it turns out to be surprisingly small @xcite , the unprojected wave functions are not very useful for quantitative estimates , especially in the limit of large @xmath2 . here , a good quantitative account is given by the lowest - ll - projected cf wave functions .",
    "( here and below , it will be understood that the phrase  lowest landau level \" refers to the lowest ll of electrons ; composite fermions _ themselves",
    "_ will be allowed to occupy any number of _",
    "cf_-lls , which all reside completely within the lowest electronic ll . ) in our earlier work , the projection was computed numerically ( exactly ) by expanding the cf wave function into electronic basis states and throwing away the part containing higher lls @xcite .",
    "however , the time and memory requirements increase exponentially for this method , limiting the projection to approximately 10 particles .",
    "it is also possible to express the projection operator in an integral form , but monte carlo with these wave functions runs into the technical difficulty of the fermion sign problem .    as a result",
    ", our quantitative understanding of the fqhe in the past has been largely limited to what we can learn from the studies of small systems , either from exact diagonalization or using the cf wave functions ( both of which produce virtually identical results ) .",
    "the size of the many - body hilbert space is the smallest closest to half filled ll , and grows quickly away from @xmath12 . as a result , the maximum number of electrons for which exact diagonalization has been performed depends on the filling factor ; at @xmath14 1/5 , 1/3 , 2/5 or 3/7 , it is @xmath15 7 , 8 , 10 , or 12 @xcite and the largest system studied to date is 14 @xcite . while systems containing 10 - 12 particles are sufficiently large for convincing ourselves of the validity of the concept of composite fermions and testing the accuracy of the cf wave functions , they are pitifully small for making reliable thermodynamic estimates for several quantities of interest .",
    "in fact , several of the fqhe states do not even show up in such small systems , which can be understood as follows . in the conventional spherical geometry ,",
    "the @xmath16 fqhe state requires at least @xmath17 electrons , as seen by analogy to the iqhe : @xmath17 is the minimum number of fermions needed to fill @xmath11 lls . as a result ,",
    "only two data points are available for 3/7 ( @xmath18 and 12 ) , while 4/9 , 5/11 , _ etc_. are totally inaccessible .",
    "the situation is worse for the states at @xmath19  here , it is difficult to study even 2/9 . due to an exponential increase with the number of electrons in the computer time and memory requirements , it is safe to assume that at best marginal improvements will be possible in the future exact diagonalization studies , which will therefore not tell us much more than what they already have . consquently , our best hope for a better quantitative description of the fqhe lies in developing new techniques to work with the cf wave functions .",
    "progress was made in studying large cf systems for the low - energy excitations of the @xmath20 states . here",
    "the unprojected cf wave functions have the special feature that they have at most one electron in the second ll , and the projection operator can be written simply as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the kinetic energy operator .",
    "this was exploited by bonesteel @xcite to study large cf systems and to compute the gap to charged excitation . the cf prediction for the gap was slightly lower than the one obtained from the laughlin s trial wave functions .",
    "the full dispersion of the neutral excitation was determined by kamilla , wu and jain using similar techniques @xcite .",
    "this approach , however , is not applicable to general fractions , for which the number of electrons in higher lls in the unprojected cf wave function is a finite _ fraction _ of the total number of electrons , growing with the total number of electrons .",
    "it is clearly desirable to find ways of computing with the cf wave functions for large systems at _ arbitrary _ filling factors .",
    "the study of @xmath23 states at large @xmath11 is interesting not only in its own right but may also shed further light on the compressible 1/(2p ) state . in this paper , we report on a method which enables computations for rather large cf systems .",
    "we give below results for as many as 50 composite fermions ; treatment of bigger systems should be possible in the future .",
    "this constitutes a significant step in our ability to achieve detailed quantitative predictions for the fqhe .",
    "short reports on parts of this paper have been published elsewhere @xcite .    as a first application of this method , we have computed the ground state energies and the gaps to charged and neutral excitation for several fqhe states of interest .",
    "there are several parameters in actual experiments , namely the finite quantum well width @xcite , landau level mixing @xcite , finite zeeman energy , and disorder , which influence these energies .",
    "our aim in this work will be to obtain a quantitative description in an idealized situation where these effects become unimportant , namely the limit in which the transverse width of the quantum well , disorder , and @xmath24 all vanish .",
    "the last has the effect of supressing any ll mixing or spin reversal .",
    "besides being theoretically convenient and clean , this limit is sufficient for obtaining zeroth order estimates as well as trends .",
    "furthermore , previous work tells us how to include these effects and how much of a quantitative correction they make .",
    "for example , the gap to charged excitations is reduced approximately by a factor of 2 when corrections due to finite well width and ll mixing are taken into account for typical sample parameters @xcite .",
    "in fact , all of the effects neglected in the ideal limit are found to _ reduce _ the gaps , so our estimates will provide an upper bound for them .",
    "another promising approach toward a quantitative description of the fqhe is the chern - simons field theoretic approach @xcite .",
    "it is best suited for a description of the long distance physics , an understanding of which is most crucial in the case of the fermi sea of the composite fermions , where the correlations are expected to have power law decays .",
    "a computation of the short distance properties like the gaps has not yet been possible in this approach , except asymptotically close to @xmath12 @xcite . in the most widely used framework @xcite ,",
    "the cs field theory is treated as an _ effective _ long - distance theory of composite fermions , with the effective mass of composite fermions treated as an input parameter , to be fixed either by comparison with experiment or by other microscopic means .",
    "in addition to providing a new calculational tool , the new lowest ll ( lll ) representation of the cf wave functions also suggests how the cf theory can be motivated quite plausibly within the lowest landau level , without appealing to higher lls at all .",
    "the composite fermions , their effective magnetic field , their quasi - ll structure , and their effective cyclotron energy are all seen to originate in this approach as a direct consequence of repulsive interelectron interaction .",
    "the single particle wave functions of composite fermions in the lowest ( electronic ) ll are shown to possess the appealing property of having zeros tightly bound to electrons , aside from a few localized defects .",
    "this shows that while the analogy to higher lls is a convenient , and intuitively powerful route to the cf theory , it is by no means necessary .",
    "the organization of the rest of this chapter is as follows .",
    "section ii gives the explicit form of the cf wave functions in the lowest landau level .",
    "the essential result is displayed in the beginning of ii.c in a form ready to be used by the interested reader .",
    "section iii presents results of our monte carlo calculations for the ground state energies and the gaps .",
    "in particular , it is found that the gaps to charged excitations are in reasonable agreement with the formula suggested by halperin _",
    "@xcite , and the study of the neutral excitations uncovers an instability of fqhe for @xmath25 . in section iv",
    ", we show how the composite fermion wave functions can be motivated within the lowest ll , and how concepts like effective magnetic field , effective filling factor , cf - ll index , and effective cyclotron energy appear here .",
    "this work is formulated in the disk geometry , which also gives us an excuse to compare the cf wave functions with the exact wave functions in the disk geometry .",
    "the paper is concluded in section v.",
    "we start by considering the spherical geometry in which @xmath26 electrons move on the two - dimensional surface of a sphere @xcite under the influence of a radial magnetic field @xmath2 . by virtue of having no boundaries ,",
    "this geometry is convenient for an investigation of the bulk properties of the cf state .",
    "the disk geometry will be considered in a later section .",
    "the single particle eigenstates are the monopole harmonics , @xmath27 @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 , the total flux through the sphere is equal to @xmath30 ( @xmath31 is an integer ) , @xmath32 is the ll index , @xmath33 labels the degenerate states in the @xmath11th ll , and @xmath34 .",

    "for the present purposes , it is important that @xmath78 be independent of @xmath82 although it may depend on @xmath81 ; this is because the single particle wave functions of the @xmath83th electron appearing in @xmath69 have different @xmath82 but the same @xmath84 . to this end , we multiply one of the terms on the right hand side of eq .",

    "( [ mh ] ) is used .",
    "otherwise , the simple replacement of @xmath95 or @xmath96 by the corresponding derivatives does not give the projection and neither are the cancellations indicated above obtained .",
    "the most important goal of theory is to provide an understanding of the low - lying states of the system in question .",
    "we will concentrate here on the ground and the low - energy states at the special filling factors @xmath112 .",
    "the ground state energy of the incompressible states is of interest , even though it can not be measured directly , because it serves as an important criterion when comparing different theories of the fqhe , or in investigating the question of the stability of a fqhe state relative to another state with a different symmetry , e.g. , the wigner crystal @xcite .",
    "two kinds of excitations are relevant for experiments : the charged and the neutral excitations .",
    "the gap to the charged excitations appears in transport experiments as the activation energy , while the dispersion of the neutral excitations , in particular the gap at the minima or maxima , can be measured by inelastic light @xcite or phonon scattering @xcite .",
    "the smallest energy required to create an excitation will also play an important role in the low - temperature thermodynamics of the fqhe .",
    "let us first summarize the status of our quantitative understanding of the fqhe prior to the the cf approach .",
    "( i ) ground state energy : the energies of the 1/3 and 2/5 states have been determined reasonably accurately from an extrapolation of exact diagonalization results @xcite .",
    "a good _ ansatz _ exists for the ground state at @xmath20 in the form of the laughlin @xcite wave functions .",
    "the energy of the laughlin state is known accurately from monte carlo study @xcite of large systems , and is in good agreement with that obtained from the exact diagonalization results .",
    "( ii ) charge gap : almost the same story holds here .",
    "reasonable estimates are available for the gaps of 1/3 , 2/5 and , to some extent , for 3/7 from exact diagonalization studies @xcite .",
    "the gap of the 1/3 state has also been calculated using the laughlin trial wave functions .",
    "( iii ) neutral excitations : a single mode approximation ( sma ) @xcite was found to work reasonably well for 1/3 , but less well for other laughlin states , as we shall see , and not well for other fqhe states .",
    "the exact diagonalization studies exhibit strong finite size effects for the @xmath16 states with @xmath113 and fail to give a reliable account for the dispersion of the neutral excitations .    in the cf theory",
    ", the fqhe ground state at @xmath112 corresponds to @xmath11 filled cf - lls .",
    "the excitations are obtained by removing one composite fermion from the @xmath11th cf - ll , leaving behind what we will call a  quasihole \" , and placing it in the @xmath114st cf - ll , creating a  quasiparticle \" .",
    "this excitation will be called a ( cf-)exciton . the orbital angular momentum @xmath115 of the state is related to the wave vector @xmath116 of the planar geometry as @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the radius of the sphere , in units of the magnetic length ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "the configuration with the quasiparticle and quasihole on opposite poles will be identified with the charged excitation , as the distance between the quasiparticle and the quasihole is the maximum ; this corresponds to the largest @xmath115 state of the exciton .",
    "the transport gaps at @xmath20 have been computed using the cf theory @xcite .",
    "it was found that the cf theory gives marginally smaller gaps than those computed using laughlin s trial wave functions ( the difference is more significant for short range interactions than for the long range coulomb interaction ) .",
    "we note here that here the cf wave functions for the ground state and the quasihole are identical to those of laughlin s , but the quasiparticle wave functions are different , resulting in unequal values of the gaps .",
    "the interaction energy per particle is @xmath120 @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the arc distance between two electrons , and @xmath123 is the radius of the sphere",
    ". it will be evaluated by variational monte carlo techniques , with the absolute value squared of the slater determinantal wave function of composite fermions used as the probability weight function for the metropolis acceptance sampling .",
    "the methods are standard , but a few points should be mentioned .",
    "it takes @xmath124 operations to evaluate a slater determinant . for a free fermion problem , if a single particle is moved , only one row ( or column ) of the density matrix is altered , and it takes only @xmath26 operations to evaluate the new determinant in terms of the old inverse matrix and @xmath125 operations to update the inverse matrix if the move is accepted @xcite .",
    "however , the cf slater determinant describes a _ strongly correlated _ electron system and hence is explicitly _ non - local _ ,",
    "i.e. when a single electron is moved all cf matrix elements are altered , since the single particle wave function of a given composite fermion depends on the positions of all the particles .",
    "therefore , an update of the trial @xmath126 density matrix of the cf system proceeds through @xmath124 operations at every metropolis step .",
    "the time @xmath127 involved in our variational monte carlo calculations for the coulomb interaction energies of the @xmath26 - electron system in the @xmath128 fqh state scales as : @xmath129 the cost of evaluating the cf determinant goes as @xmath130 , the cost of projection as @xmath131 , and with @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the desired simulation error and @xmath134 is the total number of monte carlo steps .",
    "( the monte carlo statistical error scales as @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the standard deviation in the wave function and @xmath137 is the correlation time , which is a property of the wave function being sampled . ) typically , we have performed calculations on systems containing upto 50 particles . for example , a calculation of the ground state interaction energy on the @xmath138 cf state for 30 particles with about 20 million monte carlo steps takes @xmath139 cpu hours on our work - station ( dec model 250/4 , cpu 21064a , mhz 266 ) .",
    "a similar calculation for 30 particles in the @xmath140 cf state takes @xmath141 cpu hours on the same machine .    for the ground states and the charged excitations at @xmath112 the cf wave functions are single slater determinants . for the neutral exciton ,",
    "the wave function is a linear superposition of @xmath142 determinants , making the computations significantly more time consuming .",
    "in addition , the energy of the exciton has to be evaluated with extremely high accuracy in order to obtain reasonable values for the energy differences ; up to @xmath143 monte carlo steps were carried out in our computations of the exciton energy .",
    "a good accuracy is especially important at small @xmath144 , where the exciton energy becomes rather small ; we will be dealing with energy differences as small as 0.001 @xmath145 , which is approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than the transport gap of the 1/3 state .",
    "we note that when coulomb energies are calculated for finite systems with an intent to obtain thermodynamic estimates , usually an infinite ewald summation @xcite has to be performed that accounts for the interaction of the charges with their image charges with respect to the finite boundary imposed in the calculation ; no such sum is necessary in the spherical geometry due to absence of boundaries .",
    "before we proceed to compute the energies , we ask how reliable the cf wave functions are . to this end",
    ", we compare the energies of the cf wave functions to the exact eigenenergies obtained numerically , both for the ground state and the charged excitation , shown in table i. the exact energies were obtained by a numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian in the lowest ll subspace , assuming an ideal two - dimensional system .",
    "further details can be found in the literature ( see , for example , wu and jain @xcite ) .",
    "all energies quoted in table i and the rest of the paper include the interaction with the positively charged neutralizing background , which amounts to an addition of @xmath146 , the interaction energy of the @xmath26 electrons with a positive charge @xmath147 at the center of the sphere .",
    "the accuracy of the cf theory is impressive ; the predicted energies agree with the exact energies to better than @xmath148 for the systems studied , which represent the biggest systems for which exact diagonalization has been performed at 2/5 and 3/7 .",
    "we note that these system sizes are already large compared to the relevant length in the problem , namely the magnetic length ( or the effective magnetic length ) , which , coupled with the fact that the energies are determined largely by the short - distance behavior , suggests that the error in the thermodynamic limit ought not to be much larger . in other words , extrapolation of the cf energies to large @xmath26 will produce virtually the same results as extrapolation of the exact energies .",
    "since the gap is an @xmath149 energy obtained as the difference between two large @xmath150 energies , its accuracy is expected to be less than that of either the ground state or the excited state energy .",
    "a comparison of the gaps predicted by the cf theory with with the corresponding exact gaps ( table i ) shows that the discrepancy is of the order of a few percent .",
    "this level of accuracy is possible only because the ground and the excited state energies are extremely accurate .",
    "the full dispersions of the neutral excitations obtained in the cf theory have a similar level of accuracy @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that the ground state wave functions considered here contain _ no adjustable parameters _ as they are related to the unique filled ll wave functions .",
    "though less obvious , this is also true for the single exciton state as well ( at arbitrary wave vector ) ; they are also completely determined by symmetry in the restricted hilbert space of the cf wave functions .",
    "also , since the cf wave functions constructed here are strictly within the lowest _ electronic _ ll , their energies provide strict variational bounds in the limit of zero thickness , no disorder , and large magnetic field .",
    "another point that needs to be emphasized is that although the cf wave functions are analogous to , and indeed motivated by the wave functions of _ non - interacting _ electrons at @xmath50 , they describe _ fully interacting _ electrons at @xmath46 . in other words , _ the cf wave functions provide an account of the residual interaction between composite fermions themselves_. in this sense , the wave functions go beyond the simple mean - field picture of non - interacting composite fermions .",

    "most of the essential features of experiments can be explained from this very simple picture , so it is no surprise that the microscopic formulations of composite fermions @xcite have closely followed this physical picture . in particular , the wave function of composite fermions is obtained by taking the wave function of non - interacting electrons in the reduced magnetic field , occupying several lls in general , attaching an even number of vortices to each electron to convert it into a composite fermion , and projecting the resulting wave function on to the lowest ll .",

    "in fact , analogy to higher lls is one of the great strengths of the composite fermion theory since it facilitates a unified description of the iqhe and the fqhe and allows a back - of - the - envelope understanding of the key experimental facts without recourse to any microscopic theory whatsoever .",

    "second , the size of the _ many - electron _ hilbert space , @xmath115 , ( which is the dimension of the matrix diagonalized to obtain the exact ground state ) is in general quite large , as shown in table v. ( this was incidentally also true for the examples discussed earlier in the context of the spherical geometry . )",

    "note also that when there is more than one compact state possible for a given @xmath279 ( e.g. , for @xmath292 and @xmath293 in table i ) , the one with the smallest energy ought to be identified with the true ground state .      the discussion above makes no reference to higher lls , yet obtains the effective magnetic field of the composite fermions . in this section ,",
    "we show that it is in fact identical to the standard approach . in the latter , the unprojected wave function of the many cf state , @xmath51 ,",
    "is related to that of the non - interacting electrons , @xmath52 , as @xmath294 ( we note here that the gaussian factor in @xmath52 is taken at the external magnetic field . alternatively",
    ", @xmath52 can be written at the _ effective _ magnetic field , but then a gaussian factor must be supplied along with the jastrow factor , which , for bulk fqhe states , implies multiplication by @xmath295 , where @xmath56 is the wave function of one filled ll @xcite . )    for illustration , consider only states for which @xmath52 is a single slater determinant , made up of single electron states of eq .",

    "in the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) of the standard picture , the composite fermions are treated as non - interacting , so their total energy is equal to the kinetic energy of electrons in the state @xmath52 , with the cyclotron energy replaced by an effective cyclotron energy of composite fermions ; i.e. , @xmath299 \\hbar\\omega^{cf}\\;.\\ ] ]    the equivalence between the the lll and the standard schemes follows if we make the following identifications : @xmath300 anticipated by our notation , and @xmath301 the ida of the lll approach is then identical to the mfa of the standard scheme .",
    "in particular , the curve of the defect energy of composite fermions in fig . [",
    "fig : rev_fig10 ] is identical to that considered earlier in @xcite for the effective kinetic energy of noninteracting fermions at @xmath284 .",
    "we now establish the equivalence between the two approaches at the level of the microscopic wave functions themselves . noting as before @xmath302\\;,\\ ] ] where the prime denotes the condition @xmath303",
    ", the wave function @xmath51 can be written as @xmath304 where @xmath305 is interpreted as the _ unprojected _ wave function of the @xmath83th composite fermion @xcite .",
    "the cf wave function in the lowest electronic ll is obtained by a lll projection of @xmath51 , which can be accomplished by projecting @xmath306 to the lowest ll .",
    "the crux of the argument is that a lll projection of @xmath307 produces precisely ( apart from normalization factors ) @xmath308 of eq .",
    "( [ scf ] ) , i.e. , @xmath309 this shows that @xmath310 of the standard approach is identical to @xmath58 of the lll approach .    to prove eq .",
    "( [ seven ] ) , we first write @xmath311 where @xmath312 . our goal is to evaluate the projection of the product @xmath313 . as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite the projection is obtained by first bringing all @xmath314 s to the left of @xmath213 s in the polynomial part multiplying the gaussian factor and then making the replacement @xmath315 while remembering that the derivatives do not act on the gaussian factor .",
    "i.e. , @xmath316 with the operator @xmath317 given by @xmath318 substituting @xmath319 and using @xmath320 the sum over @xmath116 is seen to be proportional to @xmath321 which vanishes unless @xmath322 .",
    "thus , only the term with @xmath323 survives , giving for the operator @xmath317 : @xmath324 substitution into eq .",
    "( [ seven ] ) reproduces eq .",
    "( [ scf ] ) , completing the proof of equivalence of the two formulations of the cf theory .",
    "the summary of this section is that we have shown that the origin of composite fermions , their effective magnetic field and ll structure , as well as their wave functions can all be obtained rather straightforwardly within the lowest ll .",
    "this complementary description gives additional insight into the physics of composite fermions , the formal structure of their wave functions , and the role of the lll projection operator in the standard approach .",
    "we have developed an explicit lll representation of the cf wave functions in which the lls of composite fermions are filled in the standard manner using the single particle basis states of composite fermions , in complete analogy to the problem of non - interacting electrons .",
    "the most important consequence is that it is now possible to study large cf systems , containing up to 50 composite fermions . given how much insight has been gained from the study of systems with ten or fewer particles , this represents a significant setp toward a better quantitative understanding of the fqhe .",
    "in particular , certain interesting regions of filling factor have become accessible for the first time to quantitative investigations .",
    "we have obtained estimates for the ground state energies and gaps ( both to charged and neutral excitations ) for a number of fqhe states .",
    "the charge gaps predicted by the cf theory are consistent with the general behavior observed experimentally and that anticipated by a mean - field theory , although more work will be needed to include the effects of non - zero transverse width and ll mixing before the theoretical gaps may be compared directly to the experimental ones . an important fact discovered in the course of this work is that the cf theory is capable of explaining the absence of fqhe at small filling factors ( @xmath192 ) , where the fqhe is explicitly shown to be unstable to a spontaneous generation of cf - excitons .",
    "the new lll representation of the cf wave functions also helps resolve the longstanding question : do we necessarily need to use the analogy to higher lls to explain the physics of electrons confined to the lowest ll ?",
    "the answer is in the negative .",
    "we have shown that laughlin - like arguments can be used to obtain cf wave functions within the lowest ll of electrons .",
    "concepts like the cf - ll index , cf cyclotron energy , cf filling factor , _ etc .",
    "_ , which seem to be inextricably tied to the analogy with higher lls , appear naturally also in our lll approach .",
    "in particular , the cf ll index appears as the number of defects in the single - cf wave function and the cf cyclotron energy as the energy of a single defect .",
    "this work was supported in part by the john simon guggenheim foundation , the national science foundation under grant no .",
    "dmr9615005 , and by the mrsec program of the national science foundation under award number dmr 94 - 00334 .",
    "we thank tetsuo kawamura , daniil kaplan , and k. park for discussions and help with numerical work .",
    "here we prove the general correctness of the formula @xmath325 where @xmath326 and @xmath327 .",
    "( here , @xmath22 represents factors that will not be relevant for the arguments below . )",
    "the validity of this equation was shown for @xmath91 in section [ cfwf ] . in order for it to be valid generally , the right hand side must vanish identically for @xmath89 , since no states exist in the lowest ll with @xmath89 .",
    "this is what we now show .",
    "first consider the case @xmath328 .",
    "this would be possible when @xmath329 @xmath330 then @xmath331 and the condition @xmath328 implies that @xmath332 .",
    "in fact @xmath333 . in this range ,",
    "the binomial coefficients impose the following constraints on @xmath103 : @xmath334 @xmath335 @xmath336 @xmath337 as a result , the sum over @xmath103 goes over @xmath338 now , consider the derivative @xmath339 the exponent of @xmath101 can be written as @xmath340 it is always less than @xmath103 , since @xmath341 , and also non - negative , since the smallest value of @xmath103 is @xmath342 ( @xmath343 by definition ) .",
