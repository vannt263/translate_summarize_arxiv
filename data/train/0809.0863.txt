    "this method is based on the ratio between the dispersions in proper motion and radial velocity of cluster members .",
    "the accuracy of this method is limited only by the precision of the measurements and the size of the sample and , barring urecognized systematic errors , absolute distances with an accuracy of 1% might be provided ( king & anderson 2002 ) .",
    "all the above methods have practical limitations , and a definitive consensus on low- and intermediate - mass distance indicators has not yet been reached .",
    "the typical problems affecting current distance estimates might be split into two groups : _",
    "i)_ precision , i.e. , the ongoing effort to reduce random observational errors ; and _ ii)_ accuracy , i.e. , the neverending struggle to identify and eliminate systematic errors .",
    "problems associated with the former group can be alleviated by increases in sample size and in signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "usually , problems connected with the latter group can be recognized and addressed only by comparing results obtained by completely different methodologies .",
    "the number of gcs for which we have distance estimates based on different methods is quite limited .",
    "however , a few gcs do have distances based on multiple methods including the trgb ( bellazzini et al.2004 ) , rr lyraes ( del principe et al .  2006 , dp06 ; sollima et al .  2008 ) , and kinematics ( van de ven et al .  2006",

    "even with this extremely limited sample , we have evidence that the kinematic distances are significantly and systematically smaller than distances based on the other methods .",

    "the corresponding numbers for 47  tuc are 193,679 stars in an area of 353 by 413 from 16 observing runs .",
    "as we have said above , systematic errors can not be found by consideration of one data set or one methodology alone .",
    "however , in the absence of truly independent confirmation we nevertheless feel confident , on the basis of the observed consistency of the results within and between the different observing runs available to us , that these optical catalogs of the two clusters are on a common photometric system to well under 0.01@xmath6mag .    to provide photometric indices with greater temperature sensitivity we matched the optical catalog for  with a multiband nir catalog derived from observations obtained with isaac@vlt ( eso , paranal ) and sofi@ntt ( eso , la silla ) . a significant fraction of the sofi data have already been presented by dp06 , while the isaac data will be presented by calamida et al .",

    "as illustrated by the error bars in fig .  3 ,",

    "we require only the slope of the metallicity - trgb relation , and in this the two calibrations are in substantial agreement : using the quoted relations and iron abundances of [ fe / h]=-1.7 ( , metal - poor peak , johnson et al .",
    "2008 ) and [ fe / h]=-0.7 ( 47  tuc ) , the differential corrections are + 0.09 and + 0.06 with an uncertainty of 0.03 if we assume a generous error allowance of 0.2 dex on the metallicity difference between the two clusters .",
    "therefore , splitting the difference between the two corrections , the relative distance becomes @xmath37 ( ) - @xmath38 ( 47  tuc ) + @xmath39 mag . for comparison ,",
    "absolute kinematic distances to and 47  tuc have been recently provided by van den ven et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and by mclaughlin et al .",
    "the implied relative distance between the two clusters is @xmath40 ( ) - @xmath41(47  tuc ) = @xmath42 mag .    a similar value results if we use rr lyrae stars to estimate the relative distances : the variable v9 ( @xmath43 ) is the only rr lyrae currently known in 47  tuc and it is suspected to be slightly evolved ( storm et al .",
    "@xmath44-band magnitudes have been shown to be minimally affected by evolutionary corrections ( bono et al .",
    "2003 ; catelan et al .",
    "2004 ) and by assuming @xmath45 and the cardelli law , we found @xmath46 mag .",

    "2001 ) in with periods ranging from @xmath47 to @xmath48 and with accurate @xmath44-band mean magnitudes ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "in order to account for the difference in metal abundances we adopted the metallicity estimates for individual rr lyraes provided by rey et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and found that the mean metallicity for these five is @xmath50>=-1.53\\pm0.17 $ ] .",
    "the difference in mean magnitude as a function of the iron content was estimated using the theoretical calibration of dp06 . the independent theoretical calibration provided by catelan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) provides very similar distances ( dp06 ) . for a difference in metal abundance of 0.8 dex",
    "the difference in the @xmath44 band is 0.07-band p - l relations for z=0.00010.0010.004 listed in table  1 of dp06 ] mag .",
    "therefore , the relative distance based on rr lyraes is : @xmath51 ( ) - @xmath52(47  tuc ) + 0.07 = @xmath53  mag .",
    "we thus find that _ relative _ distances based on three completely independent methods agree within one sigma , or @xmath54% in distance , although admittedly the current analysis is based on only two gcs .",

    "the zero - point of the trgb calibration provided by lee et al .",
    "( 1993 ) relies on cluster distances obtained with the @xmath55 vs [ fe / h ] relation for rr lyrae stars . on this distance scale @xmath56 , and for 47  tuc @xmath57 mag , for a modulus difference of @xmath58 mag .",
    "we did not consider the trgb calibration provided by rizzi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , since 47  tuc is outside the metallicity range covered by this calibration . the use of the empirical color - metallicity relation for trgb stars by bellazzini et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and of the rizzi s trgb calibration would provide distances very similar to the above ones . the trgb calibration provided by salaris & cassisi ( 1998 ) is brighter in absolute terms , but new findings ( cassisi et al .",
    "2007 ) indicate that the discrepancy is significantly reduced .    from absolute distances based on the empirical @xmath44-band p - l relation for rr lyrae stars provided by sollima et al .",
    "( 2008 ) we found @xmath59 for while for 47  tuc we found , using the same unreddened magnitude as before for v9 , @xmath60 , and therefore @xmath61 mag .",
    "we note that the quoted absolute distances to agree quite well with the distances based on the eclipsing binary ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath20 , thompson et al .",
    "2001 ; kaluzny et al.2002 ) .",
    "the distances to 47  tuc agree quite well with the distance based on main sequence fitting ( @xmath64 , e(b - v)=0.04 , gratton et al .",
    "2003 ) , but are systematically larger than distances based on fitting the wd cooling sequence ( @xmath65 , e(b - v)=0.04 , zoccali et al .",
    "2001 ) and the zahb ( @xmath66 , salaris et al .",
    "unfortunately , robust distance estimates to based on these two methods are either not available or hampered by its spread in metal content .",
    "however , the use of these moduli and of the average trgb and rr lyrae relative distances would provide distances to similar to the kinematic distances , but systematically smaller than the other standard candles .",
    "thus , we are left with the following evidence : _",
    "i ) _ differential distance moduli or ",
    "equivalently  distance ratios based upon ( a )  the absolute @xmath5-band relation for the trgb , ( b )  the @xmath44-band p - l relations for rr lyrae stars , and ( c )  the kinematic method agree with each other to within the precision of each method , or roughly 0.06  mag ( see table  1 ) .",
    "this finding suggests that the estimated metallicity dependences of the different methods are consistent among themselves , since these two clusters differ in metallicity by @xmath67  dex .",
    "however , we obviously can not completely exclude the possibility that the agreement is either fortuitous or a result of error cancellation . _",
    "ii ) _ absolute distances based on current calibrations of the trgb and rr lyrae methods agree with each other to 0.100.15  mag , but the kinematic distance scale is 0.20.3  mag shorter ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the same outcome applies to distances based on zahb and wd fitting , they agree with each other within 0.10 mag , but they are 0.10.3 mag smaller than trgb and rr lyrae distances ( salaris et al .  2007 ) . taken together , points _",
    "i ) _ and _ ii ) _ suggest that our population  ii distance scale is _ not _ at present limited by random errors due to data precision or sample size , but rather by systematics : either a systematic error shared by the trgb method and the rr lyrae method , due perhaps to a common rung in the calibration ladder that leads to their respective zero points , or a systematic bias inherent to the kinematic method that is common to the independent studies of  and 47  tuc .",
    "while we wait for accurate trigonometric parallaxes for gcs from sim and gaia , similar analyses of new gcs should help to clarify the relative impact of random and systematic errors among the various distance indicators .",
