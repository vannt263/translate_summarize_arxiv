    "inclusive @xmath0 decays are considered fertile ground for precision tests of the standard model .",

    "tremendous effort has gone into determining ways to calculate these rates in a systematic fashion .",
    "indeed , the algorithm for calculating these rates is now part of the theoretical canon @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , experimental cuts complicate life for theorists .",
    "in particular , these cuts often force us to work near the boundary of the phase space , where the aforementioned canonical techniques break down . only now are we learning how to retool our calculations to accommodate these highly non - trivial issues .",
    "the complications arise if the cut forces us into a corner of phase space , since the calculation can now depend on a new parameter , @xmath7 , which is a measure of the relative size of phase space of interest .",
    "when this parameter becomes parametrically small , the systematics of the calculation usually break down ; perturbative qcd corrections become enhanced by large logs of the form @xmath8 , while the non - perturbative expansion in @xmath9 becomes an expansion in @xmath10 .",
    "the most relevant cut rate arises in semi - leptonic @xmath0 decays , where one wishes to measure @xmath1 by eliminating the large background from charmed transitions . to eliminate this background",
    ", we have a choice of variables with which to cut .",
    "perhaps the simplest choice is the electron energy , which is the oldest method used for extracting @xmath11 .",
    "unfortunately , as has been widely discussed in the literature , such extractions are typically model dependent since the rate in this window is sensitive to the fermi motion of the heavy quark .",
    "there is no way to write down a meaningful theoretical error for such extractions .",
    "it is only very recently that a model independent method has been proposed , within a well defined systematic scheme @xcite , that could lead to an extraction with a well defined error .",
    "it is also possible to remove the background from charmed transitions by cutting on the hadronic invariant mass @xcite .",
    "while this choice presents a greater experimental challenge , it benefits from the fact that , unlike the electron spectrum , most of the @xmath12 decays are expected to lie within the region @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , it is believed that even though both the invariant mass region @xmath13 and electron energy regions @xmath14 receive contributions from hadronic final states with invariant mass up to @xmath15 , the cut mass spectrum will be less sensitive to local duality violations .",
    "this belief rests on the fact that the contribution of large mass states is kinematically suppressed for the electron energy spectrum in the region of interest .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study the viability of extracting @xmath1 from the invariant mass spectrum .",
    "in particular , we are interested in studying the breakdown of the perturbative expansion for the cut rate , and whether or not a reorganized expansion can be used reliably .    building upon the work of korchemsky and sterman @xcite , we begin by discussing how the doubly differential decay rate factorizes in moment space .",
    "we then use the recent results of @xcite to calculate a closed form expression for the inverse mellin transform at next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) order .",
    "the result for the resummed rate is presented in terms of the partonic as well as hadronic invariant mass .",
    "this result is used to extract a piece of the two loop rate , the size of which can be compared to the brodsky - lepage - mackenzie ( blm ) two loop correction .",
    "we then determine the region of invariant mass where resummation is necessary as well as the region where the reorganized expansion breaks down .",

    "the problem of summing large threshold logarithms in perturbative expansions , which arise due to incomplete kln cancellation of the ir sensitivity at the edge of phase space , has been addressed for various processes @xcite .",
    "the technique relies on factorization , which allows for resummations via a renormalization group equation .",

    "consider the inclusive semi - leptonic decay of the @xmath16 quark into a lepton pair with momenta @xmath17 and a hadronic jet of momenta @xmath18 .",
    "it is convenient to define the following _ partonic _ kinematic variables in the rest frame of the @xmath0 meson @xmath19 , @xmath20 with phase space boundaries @xmath21 in addition , it is customary to define the leptonic variables @xmath22 in terms of the leptonic variables , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , one can see that in the endpoint region of the electron energy spectrum when @xmath25 with @xmath26 , the invariant mass of the jet approaches zero with its energy held fixed .",
    "in addition , the jet hadronizes at a much later time in the rest frame of the @xmath0 meson , due to the time dilation .",
    "factorization exploits this and separates the particular differential rate under consideration into subprocesses with disparate scales .",
    "this factorization fails when the jet energy vanishes in the dangerous region @xmath27 .",
    "however , this problematic region of phase space is suppressed because the rate to produce soft massless fermions vanishes at tree level .    the infrared sensitive regions , which give rise to the large logarithms , can be determined by constructing a _ reduced _ diagram , as shown in fig .  1 . according the coleman - norton theorem @xcite",

    "soon the errors in the extraction of @xmath4 will become less significant . in this paper",
    "we will not delve into the phenomenology of the extraction of @xmath1 , as the calculation we have discussed here has not included the important non - perturbative corrections coming from the fermi motion .",
    "these corrections are parameterized in terms of a well defined structure function , @xmath85 defined in eq .",
    "( [ deff ] ) , and as discussed in @xcite , can be very large .",
    "we will reexamine the issue of the structure function in a future publication , where following @xcite , we will eliminate the structure function from the cut rate prediction by utilizing the data from the end - point of radiative @xmath0 decays , which in turn encodes all the information contained in the structure function .    from fig .  4 we see that , for large values of @xmath4 , the resummation is not under control for phenomenologically interesting cuts and thus it may not be possible to extract @xmath1 in this way . however , when modding out by the soft function using the @xmath175 rate , there are cancellations which lead to a perturbative series which is better behaved .",
    "this is indeed what happened in the case for the electron energy spectrum@xcite .",
    "thus , we refrain from drawing any conclusions regarding the viability of extracting @xmath1 from the invariant mass spectrum at this time .    the purpose of this paper was to determine the effect of threshold resummation on the rate for semi - leptonic @xmath0 decays with a cut on the hadronic invariant mass .",
    "we first showed how the rate factorizes when written in terms of hadronic variables , generalizing the results of @xcite . using this factorization , we resummed the cut rate at next to leading order in the infrared logs and found that , for cuts of interest , the resummation is crucial , and that for @xmath176 , even the next to leading order resummed rate is no longer reliable .",
    "however , this breakdown point depends on the value of @xmath4 , and becomes smaller as @xmath4 is decreased .",
    "a more phenomenological analysis , including the effects of the structure function responsible for the fermi motion , is forthcoming .",
