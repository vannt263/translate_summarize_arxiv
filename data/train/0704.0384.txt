    "therefore experiment should provide an adequate detection range . in order to reconstruct an event , a complete kinematic information about the particles in the relativistic fragmentation cone is needed which , e.g. , allows one to calculate the invariant mass of the system . the accuracy of its estimation decisively depends on the exactness of the track angular resolution . to ensure the best angular resolution ,",
