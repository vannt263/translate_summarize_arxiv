    "the metal - insulator transition that is observed in doped semiconductors and other disordered solids is not fully understood , despite almost twenty years of intense experimental and theoretical efforts.@xcite there is strong evidence for both disorder and electron - electron interactions to play an important role at this transition , which is called an anderson - mott transition ( amt ) to distinguish it from a disorder dominated pure localization or anderson transition on one hand , and from a correlation dominated pure mott transition on the other hand.@xcite this interplay between disorder and interactions makes the amt a very hard problem in statistical mechanics .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "until very recently virtually all approaches studied the problem in the vicinity of two dimensions ( d=2 ) by generalizing wegner s theory for the anderson transition.@xcite these theories@xcite have led to a classification of the amt into various universality classes that depend , _ inter alia _",
    ", on the presence or absence of spin - orbit scattering , magnetic impurities , magnetic fields , etc . for most of these universality classes ,",
    "perturbative renormalization group methods lead to a critical fixed point in @xmath0 dimensions , and standard critical behavior with power - law scaling is found .",
    "however , the framework of these theories does not allow for an order parameter ( op ) description of the amt , and does not lead to a simple landau or mean - field theory . as a result , the physics driving the amt remains relatively obscure in this approach , compared to standard theories for other phase transitions .",
    "an alternative line of attack has recently been explored by the present authors.@xcite . in these papers we showed that the same model @xcite that was used for the @xmath1 expansion allows for an op description of the amt with the tunneling density of states ( dos ) as the op , and for a simple landau theory that yields the critical behavior exactly above the upper critical dimension @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that the problem has random - field aspects and is closely related to a random - field ising model .",
    "the structure of that theory also suggests that for certain parameter values , in particular for weak effective electron - electron interactions , the op driven amt can be pre - empted by a different kind of metal - insulator transition .",
    "the most obvious candidate is the anderson transition , where the dos or op is uncritical .",
    "these results lead to the suspicion that in large parts of parameter space important physical features of the amt have been missed both in the low - dimensional theories , and in the interpretations of experiments that were based on these theories .    on the experimental side , the best studied systems are doped semiconductors , and some of the most detailed and careful experiments have been done on si : p . in what became a benchmark experiment in the field , paalanen , rosenbaum , thomas and collaborators@xcite ( to be referred to as the bell experiment ) performed transport measurements at temperatures , @xmath3 , down to @xmath4 , and used a stress tuning technique to drive a barely insulating sample through the metal - insulator transition .",
    "these experiments concluded that the critical p concentration , @xmath5 , in this system is close to @xmath6 , and that the conductivity , extrapolated to @xmath7 , vanishes with a critical exponent @xmath8 , with error bars of about 3% for @xmath5 and about 14% for @xmath9 .",
    "the measured value of @xmath9 proved hard to understand theoretically , and the critical behavior of si : p is still considered enigmatic.@xcite more disturbingly , however , a similar experiment on the same system@xcite ( to be referred to as the karlsruhe experiment ) has recently produced results that are inconsistent with those of refs .  ,",
    "@xmath5 close to @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "these disagreements are far greater than the error bars quoted , and have not been settled between the respective experimental groups.@xcite measurements of the hall coefficient have also led to mutually contradicting results .",
    "dai , zhang , and sarachik @xcite have reported evidence for a divergent hall coeficient in si : p , in contrast to previous results @xcite that had found the hall coefficient to remain finite .",
    "finally , different experimental results have been obtained for the crossover exponent of the ( longitudinal ) conductivity in an external magnetic field,@xcite but in this case no direct comparisons on the same system have been done .",
    "the fact that the most careful experiments on the best studied systems lead to contradictory results is , taken at face value , extremely discouraging .",
    "an important question is what the source of these discrepancies is .",
    "one relevant consideration is the temperature range covered by the respective experiments , and the lowest temperature reached .",
    "this is important since any measurement of static critical exponents at the amt involves an extrapolation to @xmath7 .",
    "for instance , the discrepancy concerning the hall effect results has been blamed in ref .   on the earlier experiments not having reached sufficiently low temperatures . in the case of the conductivity exponent in si : p , however , extrapolation problems by themselves are not sufficient to explain the disagreement .",
    "references   and   agree that the extrapolated conductivity shows a ` tail ' at phosphorus concentrations @xmath12 , but disagree about whether or not this tail contains the salient physics .",
    "the bell group observed strong sample - to - sample variations of the conductivity in the tail region at the lowest temperatures , and concluded that the tail was due to sample inhomogeneities and should be discarded .",
    "the karlsruhe group , on the other hand , claims that the tail represents the asymptotic critical region of the amt .",
    "the fact that no strong sample - to - sample fluctuations were observed in this case should , however , not be overweighted : the lowest temperature reached in the karlsruhe experiment was @xmath13 , while the strong fluctuations in the bell data set in only at lower temperatures .",
    "also , sample - to - sample variations in the @xmath3-dependence of the conductivity does seem to set in just at the lowest @xmath3 reached in the karlsruhe experiment , a phenomenon attributed in ref .",
    "to ` thermal decoupling ' , i.e. problems in reaching and maintaining equilibrium . to summarize the experimental situation regarding the conductivity in si : p",
    ", one might say that unusual features , variably described as ` rounding ' , ` smearing ' , ` thermal decoupling ' , etc .",
    "were observed at low temperatures close to the critical point .",
    "these anomalies became stronger upon approaching the critical point and lowering the temperature , and the main discrepancy between the bell and karlsruhe experiments can be traced to different assumptions concerning their significance , i.e. whether or not the ` tail ' should be taken seriously .",
    "apart from the conductivity , unusual behavior has also been observed in thermodynamic properties of doped semiconductors .",
    "both the magnetic susceptibility , @xmath14 , and the specific heat , @xmath15 , show a pronounced non - fermi liqid behavior.@xcite this behavior is observed near the transition as well as far away from it , is not obviously related to any critical phenomena near the amt , and is usually explained in terms of local moments.@xcite however , bhatt and fisher @xcite have argued that once local - moment / local - moment interactions are taken into account , one obtains singularities in @xmath14 and @xmath15 that are significantly weaker than those observed experimentally .",
    "this suggests that phenomena other than local moments might contribute to the observed anomalies in the thermodynamic susceptibilities .",
    "if one insists on a conventional theoretical interpretation of the conductivity data in terms of power - law scaling@xcite , then the inescapable conclusion is that either the bell experiment erroneously discarded the data in the true critical region , or the karlsruhe experiment mistook spurious effects for the critical behavior .",
    "if this was the case , then a careful scaling analysis of both data sets and , if necessary , new and more accurate experiments , should be able to show that the conductivity , and possibly other quantities , show scaling behavior in one region but not in the other , thus settling the issue .",
    "there is , however , another possibility .",
    "if the theoretical suggestion@xcite that the amt has random - field aspects is correct , then one would expect glass - like features and unconventional scaling similar to what has been predicted@xcite and observed @xcite in classical random - field magnets .",
    "in this paper we explore these possibilities . in sec .  [ sec : ii ] we assume conventional scaling , and check whether a scaling analysis of the existing data can settle the disagreement between the experimentalists . we find that it can not , mostly due to an insufficient temperature range and the lack of precision experiments that probe the critical behavior of more than one quantity in a given material .",
    "our analysis suggests , however , various experiments that might be able to tell which , if any , of the two doping regions that have been suggested to be the critical one , displays conventional scaling behavior . in sec .",
    "[ sec : iii ] we assume instead that the amt features activated scaling of the type found in random - field magnets , appropriately modified for a quantum problem . accordingly , we first develop a general scaling description of a quantum glass , and then work out predictions for the critical behavior of various observables .",
    "we check to what extent the existing data are consistent with these predictions and propose new experiments to further investigate this issue .",
    "let us recall the homogeneity laws for the tunneling or single - particle dos , @xmath16 , and the conductivity , @xmath17 , that express conventional power - law scaling,@xcite    @xmath18    @xmath19    here @xmath20 denotes the dimensionless distance from the critical point , and @xmath3 is the temperature .",
    "since in a quantum problem temperature and frequency scale the same way,@xcite one obtains the same homogeneity laws at @xmath7 with @xmath3 replaced by @xmath21 , where @xmath21 is the external frequency in the case of the conductivity , and the distance in energy space from the fermi level , i.e. the bias voltage in a tunneling experiment , in the case of the dos . @xmath22 and @xmath9 are the critical exponents for the dos and the conductivity , respectively .",
    "@xmath23 is the correlation length exponent , @xmath24 is the dynamical critical exponent , and @xmath25 is an arbitrary length scale factor .",
    "analogous homogeneity laws can be written down for all other quantities of interest.@xcite here we focus on the dos , since it is the order parameter for the amt according to our recent theory@xcite and since it is easily measured , and on the conductivity since it is the most obviously interesting observable in the context of a metal - insulator transition .",
    "note that throughout this paper we ignore the possibility of significant corrections to scaling.@xcite    putting @xmath25 equal to the correlation length , @xmath26 , we obtain    @xmath27    and @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are scaling functions .",
    "these homogeneity laws predict that @xmath16 and @xmath17 are functions of a particular combination of their two arguments @xmath31 and @xmath3 , and they have been derived from the traditional description of the amt.@xcite they also follow from a perturbative treatment of the order parameter theory put forward recently.@xcite as has been mentioned in these references , it is likely that in the second case the perturbative results are misleading , and that the dynamical scaling in the physical dimension @xmath32 is of activated rather than of power - law type .",
    "we will explore the consequences of activated scaling in sec .",
    "[ sec : iii ] below .",
    "for now we assume that the power - law scaling expressed by eqs .",
    "( [ eq:2.3 ] , [ eq:2.4 ] ) is correct asymptotically close to the transition observed in si : p .",
    "this could be due to either the op theory of the amt not being applicable to si : p , or to the perturbative analogy between the amt and classical random field magnets being misleading . in this section",
    "we investigate the experimental consequences of this assumption . in doing",
    "so it is important to realize that the theoretical values of the critical exponents are _ not _",
    "known.@xcite    another quantity of interest is the correlation function of the local , unaveraged dos , @xmath33 which according to refs .   is the order parameter susceptibility for the amt . in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.5 ] ) , @xmath34 is the local dos at the fermi energy , and @xmath35 denotes the impurity average .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath36 obeys the homogeneity law @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the usual critical exponent that governs the spatial dependence of the op susceptibility , and @xmath39 is minus the scale dimension of a dangerous irrelevant variable in the random - field problem.@xcite in the presence of random - field effects , the perturbative value of @xmath40 is @xmath41 , while in the absence of random - field effects one has @xmath42 . even though the perturbative result can not be correct , at least not in @xmath43 , it is very likely that the presence of @xmath44 will overcompensate @xmath38 , and make the scale dimension of @xmath36 larger than @xmath41 .",
    "this leads to a strong divergence of @xmath45 , the analogue of which has been observed in classical random - field magnets.@xcite alternatively , one can consider the homogeneous correlation to find , @xmath46 with @xmath47 a scaling function . equation ( [ eq:2.7 ] ) predicts a strong divergence as @xmath48 , the presence of which can be checked experimentally .",
    "we will come back to this point .",
    "let us now check whether the data of ref .",
    "are consistent with the above homogeneity law , eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.4 ] ) . from a double logarithmic plot of the extrapolated @xmath7 conductivity",
    "the experimentalists determined the critical value of the stress , @xmath49 , in their stress - tuning experiment to be @xmath50 , and the conductivity exponent @xmath8 . from the @xmath3-dependence of @xmath51 at a stress value",
    "estimated to be close to the critical one , they also inferred the value of @xmath52 . in ref .",
    "it was shown that with these exponent values the data do not obey scaling .",
    "it must be emphasized , however , that the error in the value of @xmath53 is at least 30%.@xcite accordingly , let us keep @xmath54 and @xmath55 fixed , but let @xmath53 float freely to produce the best scaling plot .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , which replots data from fig .  1 of ref .   in a way suggested by eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.4 ] ) . with",
    "@xmath56 one obtains a scaling plot that is better than the one in ref .  , although its absolute quality is not very good .",
    "we next check whether the quality of the scaling plot can be improved by changing @xmath49 .",
    "the largest value of @xmath49 that is consistent with the error bars given in ref .   is @xmath57 . indeed ,",
    "inspection of fig .  1 in ref .",
    "shows that at @xmath58 the data still show the curvature at the lowest temperatures that the authors considered characteristic of the insulating regime .",
    "let us therefore assume that the next higher stress value , @xmath59 , was the critical one . with this value for @xmath49",
    ", we found that the best scaling plot is achieved with @xmath60 and @xmath61 , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "the quality of the scaling plot is now much better .    as figs .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , [ fig:2 ] show , the dynamical scaling plot favors a large value of the critical stress , @xmath49 , and a correspondingly small value of the conductivity exponent @xmath9 .",
    "this requires some comments in the light of the determination @xmath62 in ref .  .",
    "the determination of @xmath49 and @xmath9 in refs .   was guided by the desire to achieve a good static scaling plot , i.e. a straight line of @xmath63 vs. @xmath64 , over as large a @xmath31-interval as possible . while this is a legitimate and often used criterion for determining the critical point , in the case of si : p it leads to a rather peculiar result : it is found that an exponent of @xmath65 fits the behavior of @xmath66 very well out to @xmath67 . while this is remarkable and",
    "may well have interesting ( and presently unknown ) reasons , it is very unlikely that the critical region in si : p is that large .",
    "indeed our dynamical scaling plot , which is a more sophisticated test of scaling than the static one , shows that it is not . on the other hand , a static scaling plot over a more restricted @xmath31-range , viz . the data from fig .  1 of ref .",
    "( which is the same data set that was used to produce the dynamical scaling plots in figs .",

    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "this interpretation suggests a size of the critical region of about 1% , which is comparable with the corresponding value for most thermal phase transitions .",
    "@xcite    we conclude that the bell experiment allows for a reasonably good dynamical scaling plot , consistent with a conventional power - law scaling interpretation , provided that the location of the critical point is adjusted upward , and the value of the conductivity exponent @xmath9 downward , compared to the values given in ref .  .",
    "the resulting small value of @xmath69 aggravates the problem that results from the inequality @xmath70 in conjunction with the exponent relation @xmath71 .",
    "this interpretation is therefore only feasible within theories that allow for @xmath72 , as e.g. the order parameter description of ref .  .",
    "any theory that yields power - law scaling with @xmath71 , like those reviewed in ref .  , is inconsistent with the bell experiment unless there are large corrections to scaling.@xcite for later reference we also note that the dynamical scaling observed in this experiment",
    "is restricted to a small dynamical range of just a bit over one decade : for the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] only data at temperatures @xmath73 were included .",
    "data at higher temperature do _ not _ scale , as can be seen from the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .      for the karlsruhe data a dynamical scaling plot has been given by stupp et al .",
    "in ref .  .",
    "for a direct comparison with the bell data , we have digitized the data from fig .  1 of ref .  , and plot them in fig .  [ fig:4 ] in the same way as the bell data in figs .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] .",
    "we have included data for @xmath74 , but have left out the lowest temperature points on some samples that showed obvious rounding effects .",
    "we will discuss this rounding in the next subsection .",
    "we have assumed a critical phosphorus concentration of @xmath75 , and exponent values @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "this yields the plot shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "the slight differences between our dynamical scaling plot and that of stupp et al .",
    "( who found the optimal value of @xmath53 to be @xmath78 ) are due to stupp et al . optimizing over a larger range of @xmath31-values , and possibly due to some errors introduced by redigitizing the data .",
    "overall , however , the two plots are of comparable quality . fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] shows a static scaling plot analogous to the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "again , the assumed value of @xmath9 fits the @xmath7 conductivity well over one decade of @xmath31 .",
    "sections [ subsec : ii.b ] ,  [ subsec : ii.c ] and the accompanying figures show that the data from both the bell and the karlsruhe experiment allow for dynamical scaling plots of equal and satisfactory quality , even though their results are mutually inconsistent .",
    "a check for dynamical scaling is therefore not sufficient to distinguish between them , and it is necessary to consider addditional experimental information to settle the issue .    at the heart of the discrepancy",
    "lie the different values of @xmath5 , which differ by 6% between the two groups .",
    "an independent measurement of @xmath5 with an error of about 1% or less would therefore suffice to rule out at least one of the two interpretations .",
    "unfortunately , both groups claim to have done just that , but again do not agree on the results .",
    "paalanen et al.@xcite have measured the dielectric polarizability and in at least one sample have found insulating behavior for values of @xmath79 as little as 1% below their value of @xmath5 .",
    "lakner and von lhneysen@xcite have found the thermopower to exhibit a metallic characteristic for values of @xmath79 above their @xmath5 , but below that of the bell group .",
    "clearly , what is needed in this situation is an independent determination of @xmath5 .",
    "the existing measurements of the spin susceptibility@xcite and the specific heat@xcite are not suitable for this purpose since they showed singular behavior in the metallic phase far from the critical point .",
    "one therefore expects these thermodynamic susceptibilities to show a superposition of critical behavior and some noncritical , but nevertheless singular , background , which makes them unsuitable for the present purpose .",
    "the most obvious observable that should be free from such complications , and that is easy to measure , is the dos .",
    "if the conventional scaling scenario is correct , then the dos as a function of @xmath31 and @xmath3 should show dynamical scaling , as expressed by eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.3 ] ) , and the quality of the dynamical scaling plot should be equal to that of the conductivity with the same parameter values .    even such an additional measurement , however , may turn out to be inconclusive unless it is carried out at sufficiently low temperatures , and unless the nature of the sample - to - sample fluctuations that were observed in the ` tail ' region in refs .",
    "is clarified .",
    "the karlsruhe experiment did not observe such fluctuations , and seemed to yield a smooth conductivity as a function of doping .",
    "however , this may be misleading since the lowest @xmath3 reached in this experiment was @xmath80 , while the sample dependence in the bell experiment became obvious only at lower temperature . in this context",
    "it is interesting to note that in the latter there is a clear break in the temperature dependence of the conductivity around @xmath81 , see fig .  1 of ref .   and the inset in our fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "furthermore , in the same temperature range sample - dependent problems did start to arise in the karlsruhe experiment , which were attributed to thermal decoupling , see fig .  1 of ref .  .",
    "finally , we note that all of the work done by the group at cuny , both on si : p@xcite and on si : b @xcite , which also yielded a smooth behavior of the conductivity , was at temperatures higher than @xmath82 .",
    "we conclude that the existing experimental data on si : p provide evidence that close to the critical point ( whose location is only imprecisely known ) , and at temperatures @xmath83 there are large sample - to - sample fluctuations , and possibly equilibration problems . while the data at higher temperatures , and the low - temperature data with the ` tail ' region discarded , are not inconsistent with conventional scaling behavior , this poses the question whether the critical behavior at the amt might be more exotic than is suggested by eqs .",
    "( [ eq:2.1 ] ) - ( [ eq:2.7 ] ) .",
    "indeed , our recent work on an order parameter description of the amt shows that the amt has random - field aspects.@xcite classical random - field magnets are well known to display glassy behavior with exponentially long equilibration times , unconventional scaling , etc.@xcite it is natural to assume that similar phenomena can characterize the amt .",
    "while any conventional scaling interpretation of the amt in si : p will necessarily imply that one of the disagreeing experimental groups made a gross error in the determination of the critical concentration , an interpretation in terms of random - field physics has the potential for explaining the unusual features observed , and the disagreements between the experimentalists , in terms of real physical effects that are germane to the amt .",
    "we consider this a very appealing possibility . in the remainder of this paper",
    "we therefore take this suggestion seriously , develop it , and then come back to a discussion of the experimental situation .",
    "an important characteristic of a glass transition , as opposed to an ordinary phase transition , is the occurrence of extremely long time scales .",
    "while critical slowing down at an ordinary transition means that the critical time scale @xmath84 grows like a power of the correlation length , @xmath85 , with @xmath24 the dynamical critical exponent,@xcite at a glass transition the critical time scale grows exponentially with @xmath86,@xcite @xmath87 with @xmath88 a microscopic time scale , and @xmath89 a generalized dynamical exponent . as a result of such extreme slowing down , the system s equilibrium behavior near the transition becomes inaccessible for all practical purposes : even at the smallest feasible frequencies ( i.e. , the inverse of the longest feasible waiting times , say , days ) , finite frequency effects become noticable ( `` the systems falls out of equilibrium '' ) at modest values of @xmath86 or @xmath31 .",
    "it has been proposed that the phase transition in classical random - field magnets is of this type,@xcite and experiments have confirmed this conjecture .",
    "@xcite the physical picture behind this model of random - field magnets is as follows .",
    "the frustration induced by the competition between the exchange interaction and the random field leads to large clusters of misaligned spins , that is , locally ordered spins that ` point the wrong way ' , within the ordered phase .",
    "even though aligning these clusters leads overall to a lower free energy , it requires a large free energy barrier to be overcome .",
    "these free energy barriers grow like @xmath90 as a function of some length scale @xmath91 , and near the critical point they diverge like the correlation length @xmath92 to the power @xmath93 .",
    "the exponent @xmath89 is therefore often referred to as the ` barrier exponent ' . via the arrhenius law , this leads to eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.1 ] ) .    in a quantum system one expects time and inverse temperature to show the same scaling behavior , irrespective of whether the critical slowing down follows an ordinary power law , or eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.1]).@xcite quantum mechanics thus makes it even harder to observe the static scaling behavior , since in addition to exponentially long times or small frequencies it requires exponentially small temperatures as well . under realistic experimental conditions the system will either fall out of equilibrium , or pick up finite temperature effects",
    "this is a crucial point which we will have to keep in mind for any discussion of experimental consequences of our ideas .",
    "the role played by temperature in a glassy quantum system can be seen explicitly in fisher s recent study of a quantum - mechanical ising spin chain in a transverse random magnetic field.@xcite this system is closely related to the classical mccoy - wu model , for which a number of exact results have been obtained.@xcite since the amt has been shown to be a quantum phase transition with random - field aspects@xcite we believe that these results are qualitatively relevant for our purposes , and will often use them for comparisons . the physical idea analogous to the one explained above for spin systems is that while a repulsive electron - electron interaction always leads to a decrease in the local dos , the random potential can in general lead to an increase in the local dos as well .",
    "the competition between these two effects leads to frustration and to , for example , large insulating clusters within the metallic phase .",
    "delocalizing these large clusters requires energy barriers to be overcome which again grow like @xmath94 as the transition is approached .",
    "another question that arises is the scaling behavior of an external magnetic field . in a spin system",
    "the magnetic field , just like the temperature , obviously sets an energy scale and thus should depend exponentially on the length scale . in an itinerant electron system ,",
    "on the other hand , the magnetic field plays a dual role : it influences the orbital motion of the electrons , and in that capacity it acts like a length .",
    "however , it also couples to the electron spin via the zeeman term , and there it acts like an energy . we therefore expect the slowest dependence of a given observable on the magnetic field to be a logarithmic one , with power - law corrections",
    ". a further consequence of the barrier model is that the frequency or temperature argument of scaling functions is expected to be @xmath95 , rather than @xmath96 as in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:2.1 ] ,  [ eq:2.2 ] ) .",
    "the reason is that one expects a very broad distribution of energy barriers and hence of relaxation times @xmath97 .",
    "the natural variable is therefore @xmath98 rather than @xmath97 .",
    "@xcite this is often referred to as activated scaling .",
    "we next face the question of which observables can be expected to obey homogeneity laws analogous to the ones given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq:2.1 ] ,  [ eq:2.2 ] ) .",
    "first of all , we have to remember that the homogeneity laws hold for averaged quantities , with the average including both a quantum mechanical and an impurity or ensemble average , and that we have to distinguish between self - averaging and non - self averaging quantities.@xcite for the former , their probability distribution for the ensemble average becomes normal with a vanishing variance in the thermodynamic limit , so their average value coincides with the most probable or typical one . for the latter , either the probability distribution remains broad ( e.g. log - normal ) , or the most probable value is different from the average one , or both . if the observable in question is non - self averaging due to a log - normal distribution , then one expects its logarithm to be a self - averaging quantity .",
    "it is well known that in a system with quenched disorder the free energy is self - averaging , while the partition function is not , and correlation functions in general are not , either.@xcite therefore , all thermodynamic quantities , which can be obtained as partial derivatives of the free energy , are self - averaging . for a general thermodynamic quantity , @xmath99",
    ", one might therefore expect a homogeneity law @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the scale dimension of @xmath99 , @xmath102 is a scaling function , and @xmath103 is a microscopic temperature scale , e.g. the fermi temperature .",
    "a finite frequency will have the same effect as a finite temperature ; as mentioned above , frequency and temperature are interchangeable in a scaling sense .",
    "a magnetic field dependence will be added later , when we discuss the magnetization .",
    "it is obvious , however , that eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.2 ] ) can not hold for all self - averaging quantities , or even for all thermodynamic ones .",
    "suppose @xmath99 is some self - averaging quantity , and suppose eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.2 ] ) holds for @xmath99 .",
    "then @xmath104 is also self - averaging , but since @xmath102 is not a homogeneous function of @xmath3 , eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.2 ] ) will _ not _ hold for @xmath105 .",
    "while this is a rather trivial ` breakdown of scaling ' , it has observable consequences as we will see below . here",
    "we assume that whether or not a given thermodynamic quantity obeys eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.2 ] ) can be decided by dimensional analysis : if the quantity contains scale dimensions of time or energy , then it does not obey eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.2 ] ) , else it does .",
    "for instance , the free energy density can not be written in this form , while the entropy density can , etc .",
    "however , the question whether or not a particular energy acts like an inverse time in a scaling sense can be a nontrivial one .",
    "we will further consider this point when we explicitly discuss various observables in sec .",

    "there is no reason to believe that @xmath255 would scale if one obtained bounds on the exponents and on @xmath5 by measuring thermodynamic quantities ( which do scale even under the current scenario ) at the same low temperatures as the conductivity .",
    "@xmath254 does scale , but would be hard to measure . in other words , if activated scaling is present but conventional scaling is used for analyzing experiments , then better experiments will make things worse rather than better .",
    "furthermore , @xmath238 is predicted to not be a self - averaging quantity , but to have a broad probability distribution .",
    "measurements of @xmath238 at sufficiently low temperatures should therefore show large sample - to - sample fluctuations .",
    "we propose that the unusual features that were observed in the experiments on si : p , particularly in the ultra - low temperature bell experiment , and which we have reviewed in secs .",
    "[ sec : i ] and [ sec : ii ] , are manifestations of the ` glassy ' behavior that we have derived above .",
    "the fact that the observed anomalies became stronger at lower temperatures is certainly consistent with this .",
    "the fact that other experiments@xcite did not provide any indications for @xmath238 not being a well - behaved quantity is not a valid counterargument , since they all stayed above , or barely got below , the @xmath82 where there is a clear break in the @xmath3-dependence of the conductivity , see ref .   and fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] . in order to further check this proposal",
    ", one should measure thermodynamic quantities , preferably the tunneling density of states , together with the conductivity at as low temperatures , and over as wide a temperature range , as possible . a system with a higher fermi temperature than doped si would be advantageous , since it would alleviate the need for ultralow temperatures .",
    "@xmath256 may be promising in this respect . in a very recent interesting experiment , jin et al . have found that , although conductivity data down to @xmath257 do allow for a conventional dynamical scaling plot , there are hysteresis effects which may be indicative of a glass - like behavior of the electrons.@xcite      we finally consider the electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity , which is the product of the specific heat and the heat diffusivity . for the same reasons as in the case of the electrical conductivity we expect the thermal conductivity , @xmath258 , not to be a self - averaging quantity .",
    "we define @xmath259 , with @xmath260 the boltzmann value , and expect@xcite    @xmath261    this equation can be discussed analogously to eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.18 ] ) for the conductivity .",
    "if we define @xmath262 as a measure of the thermal conductivity , then we obtain an interesting prediction for the generalized wiedemann - franz ratio @xmath263 at criticality : @xmath264 with @xmath265 and @xmath266 _ nonuniversal _ numbers ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.19b ] ) ) .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the conventional scaling description of the amt , which predicts that the wiedemann - franz law @xmath267 holds even at the transition.@xcite",
    "we conclude by briefly summarizing the results of this paper . we have employed both conventional and activated scaling scenarios to analyze experiments on the metal - insulator transition in doped semiconductors , most notably si : p .",
    "our main goals were to understand the discrepancies between different experimental findings , and to work out and analyze the glassy dynamical features of the transition that are suggested by recent theoretical advances .    in section [ sec : ii ] conventional scaling ideas",
    "were used to interpret existing experimental data .",
    "the most important conclusions were that existing experiments for the conductivity are inconsistent with each other and that , at least in si : p at very low temperatures , there are large sample - to - sample fluctuations , and possibly equilibration problems , sufficiently close to the critical point .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : iii ] we assumed that the amt is a quantum glass transition , and we developed a general description of such a transition .",
    "our chief results are as follows : ( 1 ) the specific heat and spin susceptibility are singular as @xmath48 even in the metallic phase , see eqs .",
    "( [ eq:3.14 ] ,  [ eq:3.17 ] ) .",
    "these results are consistent with existing experiments , and the theory given here provides an alternative to the previous explanation in terms of noninteracting local moments . ( 2 ) the dos is the order parameter for the quantum glass transition and it is both self - averaging and a scaling quantity , see sec .  [",

    ", it is predicted to vanish logarithmically with temperature , see eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.5 ] ) . the critical behavior of the op susceptibility has also been discussed .",
    "( 3 ) the electrical conductivity , @xmath255 , is so broadly distributed that it is not a self - averaging quantity , but @xmath253 is both self - averaging and a scaling quantity , see sec .",
    "[ subsubsec : iii.b.7 ] .",
    "this result was used to explain the sample - to - sample fluctuations in @xmath255 that were observed in si : p . in sec .",
