    "strong variability on millisecond time scales , the kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( khz - qpos ) observed in the low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) was first reported by van der klis _",
    "( 1996 ) , with observations from the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) .",
    "ever since , it led to many theoretical modelling and prediction of its origin , and to determine the _ correct _ equation of state ( eos ) of the compact objects ( see van der klis , 2006 for a recent review ) .",
    "although in its earlier stage of detection it was found in the atoll and z class of sources of the lmxbs , later it was also observed in the millisecond x - ray pulsars and a few uncategorised sources .",
    "typically these characteristic frequencies have two peaks , the lower ( @xmath2 ) one ranges from a few hundreds of hertz and the upper ( @xmath3 ) one often goes beyond a kilohertz .",
    "although some qpos with both the frequencies falling much below the kilohertz range have been observed in some black hole candidates , for the present study we shall refrain from considering them .    here",
    "we start from a recent argument if the khz - qpo - s are related in any sort of way to the spin frequency of the star .",
    "mndez and belloni ( 2007 ) re - examined all reliable available data of sources for which there exist measurements of two simultaneous khz qpo - s and spin frequencies ( @xmath4 ) and advance the possibility that the difference between the qpo - s , @xmath5 ( the difference between the upper and the lower frequencies ) are not related to each other .",
    "we have used their data for these ten sources and we find a correlation between the two simultaneous khz qpo - s raised to the power 2/3 ( fig [ fig : nuup_nulow ] ) .",
    "since qpo - s are represented by peaks in the power spectrum , they are related to the relatively stable orbits of accreting matter from which particles fall onto the compact object - in our case assumed to be a strange star - and these orbits are the maximally stable orbit given by an average radius of @xmath1 for @xmath3 and the outermost orbit @xmath6 for @xmath2 .",
    "this assumption leads to possible determination of the mass and radius of the compact strange star .",
    "turning to history , the most popular model to explain the difference of khz qpos was the beat frequency model ( strohmayer _ et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ) which assumed the upper qpo ( @xmath3 ) as the keplerian orbital frequency @xmath7 of the innermost orbit in the accretion disk around the star , the separation between the two peaks @xmath8 @xmath9 as @xmath10 and the lower qpo ( @xmath2 ) as the beat frequency of @xmath7 and @xmath10 .",
    "this model had suggested that for a particular star @xmath11 will remain constant .",
    "however , it has been observed that in many sources the @xmath5 is not related to @xmath10.also @xmath5 changes with time .",
    "the qpo resonance model of kluzniak and abramowicz ( 2001 ) is a beautiful model but comes with its own set of problems .",
    "it states that the qpo could be explained by non linear resonant motions of accreting fluid in strong gravity .",
    "the two qpo frequencies depend here on the amplitude of the oscillatory motion and are approximately in the ratio 3:2 .",
    "however , the difficulties mainly arise from the fact that qpo frequencies are not consistently equal to this mentioned ratio , and the twin peaks shift their positions ( rebusco , 2008 ) .",
    "although all of the present qpo models come with some conceptual difficulty or the other , for our present work , we shall adhere to the qpo model of titarchuk and osherovich ( 1999 ) which allowed us in an earlier paper to determine the mass and limits to the radius of the accreting star ( li _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) .",
    "most compact stars showing a pair of qpo - s in the x - ray power spectrum , have variable @xmath12 . the first star to show accurately constant x - ray pulse period was the x - ray pulsar sax j1808.4@xmath03658 .",
    "this source was found to show khz qpo - s with the a frequency difference of 195 khz .",
    "this is roughly half the spin frequency of the star @xmath10 which is measured very accurately to be 401 hz . so a modified beat frequency model was tried with @xmath13 .",
    "but for many other stars the difference of khz qpo - s has no apparent correlation with the spin frequency of the star like that has been suggested by the beat frequency model .",
    "there are now at least five other x - ray pulsars whose spin is steady and accurately measured and only for one of these , xte j1807@xmath0294 khz qpo - s have been seen .",
    "we find , from applying the titarchuck and osherovich(1999 ) model , that the masses ( m ) and radii ( r ) of these two stars are very small and may fit those of strange stars .",
    "we assume the possibility that the lower qpo frequency is due to particles thickly clustered at the inner edge of the accretion disc ( at a radial distance @xmath6 ) and the upper qpo frequency is due to particles thickly clustered at the marginally stable orbit ( at a radial distance @xmath1 ) .",
    "the expression for the marginally stable radius ( bardeen , press and teukolsky , 1972 ) is given as :    @xmath14^{1/2}\\right\\rbrace\\ ] ]    where @xmath15^{1/3}[(1+a / r_g)^{1/3 } + ( 1-a / r_g)^{1/3}]\\ ] ] @xmath16^{1/3}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the moment of inertia , @xmath21 is the velocity of light and @xmath22 is the gravitational constant .",
    "a lower limit for @xmath23 according to the titarchuck and osherovich model is as follows ( li _ et al .",
    "_ , 1999b ) @xmath24 and hence it is clear that @xmath23 depends only on @xmath25 and whereas @xmath1 depends on both @xmath25 and @xmath10 .",
    "so for a particular star ( fixed @xmath25 and @xmath10 ) @xmath1 should be constant . from the fig([fig : nuup_nulow ] ) above we see that @xmath26 for most of the stars and one can calculate the most probable outermost orbit @xmath27 and consider its relation to the @xmath6 given above .",
    "we tabulate @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath10 for 10 sources in table [ list ] for which fig([fig : nuup_nulow ] ) shows that @xmath28 is nearly constant .         + sources & @xmath2 & @xmath3 & @xmath29 +   + sax j1808.4@xmath03658 & 499 & 694 & 401 + xte j1807@xmath0294 & 127.1 & 352.8 & 191.0 + & 184 & 374 & + & 195 & 393.4 & + & 216.5 & 449.6 & + & 246.3 & 466.3 & + & 253.9 & 490.6 & + & 359.9 & 563.6 & +   + ks 1731@xmath0260 & 898.3 & 1158.6 & 524 + igr j17191@xmath02821 & 900 & 1227 & 294 + sax j1750.8@xmath02900 & 936 & 1253 & 600.75 + 4u 1728@xmath034 & 576.6 & 925.0 & 363 + & 614.9 & 967.6 & + & 647.1 & 995.2 & + & 702.3 & 1053 & + & 749.7 & 1094.2 & + & 793.0 & 1148.9 & + & 853.8 & 1183.2 & + & 894.2 & 1172.9 & + & 308 & 582 & + 4u 1608@xmath052 & 472.8 & 798.3 & 619.0 + & 555.6 & 872.5 & + & 561.3 & 874.5 & + & 587.3 & 893.0 & + & 623.2 & 922.7 & + & 660.0 & 956.5 & + & 682.5 & 993.7 & + & 725.0 & 1040.9 & + & 754.0 & 1044.9 & + & 772.3 & 1024.9 & + & 787.7 & 1047.0 & + & 822.7 & 1061.5 & + & 866.9 & 1092.2 & + 4u 1636@xmath053 & 644 & 971 & 582 + & 688 & 1013 & + & 723 & 1053 & + & 769 & 1058 & + & 841 & 1102 & + & 856 & 1114 & + & 871 & 1122 & + & 886 & 1126 & + & 901 & 1150 & + & 913 & 1156 & + 4u 1702@xmath043 & 657.1 & 1000.1 & 330 + & 707.7 & 1037.7 & + & 770.0 & 1084.8 & + 4u",

    "this is for the eos a which gives the right masses and magnetic moments of baryons in a finite system calculation with our chosen interquark force as given in bagchi _",

    "one can see the closeness of @xmath1 to the stellar radius and this was what had made the estimate for 4u 1728@xmath034 reliable in the paper by li _",

    "since @xmath6 is just a limit - our results could mean that the outer orbit varies for this and the other stars for example , due to variations in the accretion rate .",
