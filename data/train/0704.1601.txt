    "the creation of bose  einstein condensates ( becs ) in vapors of alkali metals has opened up a unique opportunity to investigate nonlinear interactions of atomic matter waves . in particular ,",
    "an important physical problem is to develop methods allowing one to create and control matter - wave solitons in the experiment .",
    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) dark @xcite , bright @xcite , and gap - mode @xcite solitons have already been created .",
    "another fascinating phenomenon , viz .",
    ", the josephson effect in bec , was observed in condensates loaded in a double - well potential .",
    "tunneling through a potential barrier usually occurs in quantum systems on a nanoscopic scale , while the josephson effect features the tunneling of _ macroscopic _ wave functions describing intrinsically coherent states @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon has been observed in sundry systems , such as a pair of superconductors separated by a thin insulator ( the josephson effect proper ) @xcite , and two reservoirs of superfluid helium connected by nanoscopic apertures @xcite .",
    "recently , the first successful implementation of a bosonic josephson junction formed by two weakly coupled becs in a macroscopic double - well potential was reported @xcite .",
    "in contrast to hitherto realized josephson systems in superconductors and superfluids , interactions between tunneling particles plays a crucial role in the junction implemented in the bec setting , the effective nonlinearity induced by the interactions giving rise to new dynamical regimes in the tunneling . in particular , anharmonic josephson oscillations were predicted @xcite , provided that the initial population imbalance in the two potential wells falls below a critical value .",
    "the dynamics change drastically for the initial population difference exceeding the threshold of the macroscopic quantum self - trapping and thus inhibiting large - amplitude josephson oscillations @xcite .",
    "these two different regimes have been experimentally demonstrated in the bec - based josephson - junction arrays @xcite .",
    "this dynamics can be well explained by means of a simple model derived from the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) .",
    "two equations for the self - interacting bec amplitudes , linearly coupled by tunneling terms , describe the dynamics in terms of the inter - well phase difference and population imbalance .",
    "as mentioned above , the nonlinearity specific to bec gives rise to the  macroscopic quantum self - trapping \" effect , in the form of a self - maintained population imbalance jj7,jjt1,jjt2,jjt3 . in order to derive a reduced two - state model",
    ", one needs to find eigenstates of the corresponding gpe and perform stability analysis for them .",
    "such analysis can be readily performed for the square - shaped double - well potential , where analytic solutions are available @xcite . in this case , the point of the symmetry - breaking bifurcation , where asymmetric solutions emerge , can be found exactly .",
    "the present paper addresses the symmetry - breaking bifurcation and the existence and stability of asymmetric states in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) system , which is a direct extension of the familiar double - well model jj7,jj8 .",
    "the corresponding potential is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] below .",
    "it features the double - square - well shape in the @xmath0 direction , being uniform along @xmath1 . to our knowledge ,",
    "the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) has never been studied in 2d systems before . by means of the variational approximation ( va )",
    ", we will find regions where stable asymmetric solitons exist , and the prediction will be then confirmed by direct simulations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model in introduced in sec .",
    "ii , where its physical interpretations are outlined too , in terms of bec and nonlinear optics . then , in sec .",
    "iii , we derive variational equations and analyze their solutions , which predict the ssb of a _ subcritical _ type . at the end of that section , we compare the result with those for the cw ( continuous - wave , i.e. , as a matter of fact , one - dimensional ) states , for which the ssb bifurcation is of a different type , being _",

    "v concludes the paper .",
    "the starting point is the 2d equation in a normalized form , with the self - attracting cubic nonlinearity , @xmath2with @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 being , respectively , the width and depth of each well , and the width of the barrier between them , see fig .",

    "the evolutional variable , @xmath8 , is actually the propagation distance ( usually denoted by @xmath9 ) .",

    ", we assume that the wave function has different amplitudes but equal longitudinal widths , @xmath20 , in both channels . in direction @xmath0 , ansatz ( [ inner ] ) emulates the ground state of a quantum - mechanical particle in an infinitely deep potential box , therefore it vanishes at edges of the channel . in direction @xmath1 , the ansatz is assumed to be a self - trapped soliton , approximated by the gaussian .",
    "the form of the ansatz outside the channels is also suggested by quantum mechanics , emulating a superposition of exponentially decaying ground - state wave functions behind the edges of deep potential boxes , @xmath21where amplitudes @xmath19 and width @xmath20 are the same as in eq .",

    "note that ansatz ( [ inner ] ) includes the cosine trial function with a constant width .",
    "this assumption is relevant for a deeply bound quantum state ( as mentioned above , the ansatz was modeled on the pattern of the ground state in the infinite deep box ) , but not when the energy eigenvalue @xmath25 is small .",
    "indeed , if one tries to predict , by means of this ansatz , a bound state of a particle in a finite - depth rectangular potential well in ordinary ( linear ) quantum mechanics , one would arrive at a conclusion that the bound state appears only starting from a minimum finite value of @xmath4 , which is , as a matter of fact , the kinetic energy in the @xmath0 direction .",
    "a commonly known exact result is that there is no threshold for the existence of a bound state in any symmetric potential well , even if it is arbitrarily shallow .",

    "( the emerging branches of asymmetric solutions immediately go forward and are stable everywhere ) @xcite .",
    "it is relevant to compare the above results for the ssb of solitons in the 2d model to what can be predicted in the 1d counterpart of the model by the same type of the va .",

    "( [ 1d ] ) is that it predicts a critical value of @xmath41 at which the asymmetric solutions emerge , @xmath59 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , a principal difference of the ssb for the cw states from its counterpart for the solitons ( see fig .",

    "finally , it is also necessary to mention that all the cw states , considered as quasi-1d solutions of the 2d model with the self - attracting nonlinearity , are unstable against modulational perturbations ( while solitons may be completely stable in long simulations , see below ) .",

    "this procedure was applied every time when the physical parameters @xmath60 were varied .",
    "the stability of solitons produced by this method was then tested by direct integrations of perturbed states in real time .",

    ", we did not attempt to identify stability regions for the solitons by computing their eigenvalues in terms of linearized equations for small perturbations , so , in this sense , the stability borders are not completely rigorous ones .",
    "nevertheless , the distinction between unstable and stable solitons revealed by the simulations is very clear , and , on the other hand , the identification of the stability by dint of direct simulations corresponds to experimental conditions , where solitons are subject to various perturbations of a finite size .",
