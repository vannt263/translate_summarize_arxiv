    "a pseudoscalar has no gauge - invariant renormalizable couplings to sm gauge fields .",

    "the dual field strength tensors are defined by @xmath28 , and similarly for the other field strength tensors .",
    "the above lagrangian allows us to parameterize the decays of @xmath29 to @xmath0 , @xmath30 , @xmath20 , @xmath2 , and @xmath31 .",
    "the amplitudes for these processes can be easily derived from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : phi - l ] ) . at leading order ,",
    "their dependence on the parameter @xmath32 is : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the weak mixing angle .",
    "it is readily apparent from the above equation that the decay amplitude to a particular gauge boson pair can be adjusted by tuning the parameter @xmath32 . in particular",
    ", each amplitude vanishes at a different value of @xmath32 : @xmath35 we illustrate this behavior by plotting the partial widths of @xmath29 to @xmath2 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 as a function of @xmath32 in fig .",
    "[ fig : phi - br ] , for a @xmath29 mass of 126  gev .",
    "notice in particular that the partial widths to @xmath3 and @xmath1 are in general much smaller than those to @xmath0 or @xmath2 , except for @xmath32 values near the zeros of the @xmath0 or @xmath2 amplitudes .",
    "this is due to the kinematic suppression of these decays for @xmath29 masses below the @xmath19 and @xmath20 thresholds .",
    "this kinematic suppression will force us to choose @xmath32 very close to the zero of the @xmath0 amplitude in order to match the rates in @xmath0 and @xmath6 experimentally observed for the 126  gev boson .",
    "we now determine the value of @xmath32 required to fit the observed rates in @xmath0 and @xmath6 final states of the 126  gev boson .",
    "this can be done using only the ratio of rates ( the overall production rate for @xmath36 can be adjusted by varying @xmath37 ) .",
    "the fit is complicated by the fact that @xmath21 contributes substantially to the @xmath6 final state selected by the lhc experiments .",
    "we proceed as follows . in the sm ,",
    "the ratio of higgs partial widths into @xmath1 versus @xmath0 for a higgs mass of 126  gev is predicted to be  @xcite to the @xmath6 final state is experimentally negligible because @xmath38 ; taking the photon off shell suppresses the @xmath39 contribution even further . ]",

    "\\to zz^ * \\to 4e)}{\\gamma(h \\to \\gamma\\gamma ) } ,      \\label{eq : rfactored}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 refers to the width after cuts ( defined in terms of the total signal rate after cuts ; the boson production cross section and total width factors cancel in the ratio with @xmath44 ) . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rfactored ] ) is determined by a monte carlo simulation using calchep  @xcite , the second is computed at leading order to match the signal calculation , and the third is what has been measured by atlas and cms .",
    "we match the observed rates by requiring that the ratio of rates to @xmath6 and @xmath0 for the pseudoscalar be the same as that of the sm higgs ; i.e. , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rfactored ] ) we make the replacement , @xmath45    to determine the acceptance for @xmath46 and the partial width after cuts for @xmath47 , we apply a subset of the atlas selection cuts  @xcite :    * each pair of leptons must be separated by at least @xmath48 . *",
    "the electron - positron pair with invariant mass @xmath49 closest to the @xmath7 mass must satisfy 50  gev @xmath50  gev .",
    "* the remaining electron - positron pair must have an invariant mass @xmath51 between 20.5  gev and 115  gev .",
    "this cut affects how much the process @xmath52 contributes to the signal after cuts , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : m34 ] .",
    "note that the @xmath39 contribution after cuts is about 2400 times the size of the true @xmath1 contribution , in extreme contrast to the sm higgs .",
    "putting everything together and adjusting the value of @xmath32 until eq .",
    "( [ eq : rfactored ] ) is satisfied , we obtain two solutions for @xmath32 , corresponding to the two sides of the zero in the @xmath0 rate shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phi - br ] . for concreteness",
    "we take the side with smaller @xmath53 , @xmath54 note that @xmath32 must be tuned to within ten percent of @xmath55 . because of the rapid variation of @xmath56 in this range of @xmath32 , factor - of - two changes in the ratio @xmath57 result in only small absolute changes in the value of @xmath32 .",
    "our results in the next section for the rates for @xmath24 and @xmath25 do not depend sensitively on such small variations in @xmath32 .",
    "this justifies the several assumptions that we have made in the above analysis :    * we fit the value of @xmath32 to the sm prediction for @xmath58 , rather than to the measured ratio .",
    "the measured ratio is smaller than the sm prediction , but consistent within the experimental uncertainties ( atlas and cms both measure a rate in the @xmath0 channel somewhat larger than the sm expectation ) .",
    "fitting to the sm prediction rather than the measurements yields a slightly different value of @xmath32 but will not change our overall conclusions .",
    "* we assume that the experimental acceptance for the pseudoscalar @xmath59 signal is the same as that for the sm @xmath60 signal .",
    "this allows us to write @xmath44 in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rfactored ] ) and @xmath56 in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : replacement ] ) without including selection efficiencies .",
    "because the decay kinematics are identical , the difference in efficiencies in this case can come only from the difference in the @xmath61 distribution of the initially produced boson and the kinematics of the accompanying jets .",
    "a proper evaluation of the difference in efficiencies would require a full simulation of higgs and pseudoscalar production , which is beyond the scope of our analysis .",
    "in any case , this effect is small enough that it will not change our conclusions .",
    "* we do not apply @xmath61 or rapidity cuts to the leptons in the @xmath41 final states .",
    "this will affect our results only to the extent that @xmath62 and @xmath29 are produced with different transverse momentum distributions .",
    "again , this effect is small enough that it will not change our conclusions .",
    "with @xmath32 in hand , we can read off the predictions for the pseudoscalar decay widths to @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "we find , @xmath63 for comparison , the corresponding ratios for the 126  gev sm higgs are  @xcite @xmath64    the smallness of the rate for @xmath24 , 440 times smaller than the sm @xmath65 rate , disfavors the pseudoscalar insofar as atlas and cms have observed weak signals in this channel ( @xmath66 from cms and @xmath67 from atlas  @xcite ) . in particular , the atlas analysis of 8  tev data , which provides the largest contribution to their overall significance , so far includes only the @xmath68 final state .",
    "this is interesting because @xmath69 , @xmath70 will spill in to the same - flavor event selections , thereby boosting the rates in these channels , but it can not contaminate the @xmath71 sample .    the most direct probe , however , is the very large enhancement of the rate for @xmath72 , 170 times larger than the sm @xmath73 rate .",
    "this translates  @xcite into a cross section for @xmath72 of 4.8  pb ( 6.0  pb ) at 7  tev ( 8  tev ) .",
    "this cross section is too small to be constrained by direct comparison with the continuum @xmath2 cross section , measured by atlas and cms to be about 290  pb ( up to 10% uncertainty ) in the fiducial region of @xmath74  gev , @xmath75 , @xmath76  gev  @xcite .    on the other hand , @xmath77 produces an invariant mass peak .",
    "a phenomenological study of this channel has been done for the sm higgs in ref .",
    "@xcite , which found a 95% cl exclusion reach of @xmath78 for a 126  gev higgs with 20  fb@xmath8 at 8  tev after an optimized cut on a multivariate discriminant ( including only statistical uncertainties ) .",
    "scaling to the luminosity of @xmath79  fb@xmath8 already used for higgs analyses at 8  tev , this should translate into an idealized exclusion reach of about @xmath80 .",
    "the pseudoscalar prediction of @xmath81 in the @xmath2 channel should therefore be easy to either discover or exclude in current data , even with a non - optimized analysis .",
    "finally we comment on the total width of the pseudoscalar .",
    "so long as br(@xmath82 , the total width is dominated by @xmath2 and we find br(@xmath83 . in this case",
    "the signal rate in @xmath84 matches the sm higgs prediction for @xmath85 .",
    "this can be used to fix @xmath37 .",
    "the overall scaling factor @xmath86 on the effective electroweak gauge couplings can then be adjusted to maintain br(@xmath82 . and",
    "@xmath86 can of course be increased together to maintain a constant value of @xmath87 while increasing the total width of @xmath29 . ]",
    "insofar as br(@xmath88 in the sm  @xcite , the total width of the pseudoscalar can therefore be comparable to the sm higgs total width of about 4.2  mev  @xcite , i.e. , well below the detector resolution .",
    "we can think of only two potential loopholes in our prediction for the easily - excludable large enhancement of the @xmath2 rate for a pseudoscalar . both involve the breakdown of the effective lagrangian description of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : phi - l ] ) .      starting from a renormalizable theory , the effective couplings of the pseudoscalar to a pair of gauge bosons in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : phi - l ] ) are generated by loops of fermions that couple to the pseudoscalar and carry the appropriate gauge charge . in the limit that the fermions are much heavier than the pseudoscalar , @xmath89 , and @xmath7 , the effective lagrangian is recovered .",
    "however , if the fermions are light enough , the loop amplitude will depend on the invariant masses of the external gauge bosons .",
    "in particular , the coefficients @xmath86 of the hypercharge effective coupling and @xmath90 of the su(2)@xmath91 effective coupling could take different values for the @xmath2 final state than for the @xmath0 final state . this has the effect of enhancing the contribution of any particular fermion to @xmath2 compared to its contribution to @xmath0 , as follows .",
    "the fermion loop function for on - shell @xmath59 is given by  @xcite @xmath92 and for on - shell @xmath93 by @xmath94      \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{2 } \\",

    "forming the ratio ( normalized to 1 at @xmath99 ) , @xmath100    this effect can be used to shift the effective @xmath32 value in the @xmath2 amplitude upward ( for a light fermion carrying only weak isospin ) or downward ( for a light fermion carrying only hypercharge ) .",
    "we see that the shift in this effective @xmath32 value is constrained to be less than 9% in either direction ( we take 100  gev as a lower bound on the mass of such a new fermion due to its non - observation at lep-2 ) .",
    "such a shift in the effective value of @xmath32 is too small to significantly change the prediction for @xmath101 , so it does not provide a loophole in the exclusion .",
    "our prediction of the huge enhancement in the @xmath2 rate for the pseudoscalar rests on the requirement to tune the @xmath103 effective coupling to be close to zero in order to match the observed ratio of rates in the @xmath0 and @xmath6 final states .",
    "but what if the observed @xmath6 final state does not come from the effective vertices in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : phi - l ] ) ? in this case , @xmath32 is unconstrained and we can have @xmath104 as it is for the sm higgs .",
    "this can be achieved if the observed events in the @xmath6 final state come from @xmath105 , for a new neutral gauge boson @xmath102 with mass near the @xmath7 pole ( in order to approximate the kinematics of the sm @xmath106 decay ) .",
    "such a @xmath102 under the @xmath7 pole is in fact slightly favored by lep measurements  @xcite .    in this case",
    ", a conclusive detection of the @xmath3 final state at a rate consistent with the sm higgs would still exclude the pseudoscalar possibility , which predicts @xmath107 to be more than two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath56 for generic @xmath32 values not too close to the zero in the @xmath0 rate .",
    "in this paper we examine the possibility that the newly - discovered 126  gev boson is a pseudoscalar by parameterizing the couplings to gauge bosons in terms of an effective lagrangian . in this framework , the four decay modes to @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 are controlled by only two effective couplings , i.e. , the coefficients of the @xmath108 and @xmath109 effective operators .",
    "the ratio of these coefficients can be fixed in terms of the ratio of the highest - significance experimentally - observed rates into @xmath0 and @xmath6 , leading to predictions for the rates in @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "an important part of our analysis is the realistic treatment of the @xmath110 contribution to the @xmath6 final state after experimental cuts .",
    "in fact , we find that @xmath39 dominates over @xmath1 by a factor of @xmath111 after cuts . taking this into account",
    ", the pseudoscalar model predicts a rate @xmath81 in the @xmath2 final state relative to the sm higgs . while this enhancement is not large enough to show up against the sm @xmath2 total rate , it should be easily visible ( or excludable ) through a @xmath2 resonance search using only the existing lhc data .",
    "this prediction can be evaded if the observation in the @xmath6 final state is due to exotic decays of the pseudoscalar to weak - scale @xmath102 pairs .",
    "we also find that the decay rate to @xmath3 for the pseudoscalar is dramatically suppressed compared to that for the sm higgs , yielding @xmath112 for this channel in the @xmath113 final state , which is not contaminated by @xmath39 decays .",
    "conclusive observation of the @xmath3 final state with a rate near the sm higgs prediction would thus eliminate the pseudoscalar possibility .",
    "this , however , will require additional integrated luminosity beyond that used already in the higgs analyses .",
    "the prediction of the suppression of @xmath3 is robust against new contributions to the @xmath6 final state from exotic decays of the pseudoscalar to weak - scale @xmath102 pairs .",

    "<S> we test the possibility that the newly - discovered 126  gev boson is a pseudoscalar by examining the correlations among the loop - induced pseudoscalar decay branching fractions to @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 final states in a model - independent way . </S>",
    "<S> these four decays are controlled by only two effective operators , so that the rates in @xmath2 and @xmath3 are predicted now that the rates in @xmath0 and @xmath4 have been measured . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the pseudoscalar possibility is disfavored but not conclusively excluded . </S>",
    "<S> experimental exclusion of the @xmath2 decay to well below @xmath5 or conclusive observation of the @xmath3 decay near the standard model rate would eliminate the pseudoscalar possibility . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 exclusion should be possible using existing data . </S>",
