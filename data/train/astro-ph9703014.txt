    "clusters of galaxies are the most massive , gravitationally bound objects in the universe .",
    "since their average density is only several hundred times as large as the critical density of the universe and since their collapse time is comparable to the age of the universe , they are likely to have formed recently .",
    "such a recent formation is also implied by substructure observed for many galaxy clusters .",
    "it is conceivable that non - linear dynamics and violent relaxation has not yet erased all information about the initial conditions and the formation process itself .",
    "therefore , galaxy clusters may give insight into how structure has grown in the universe . in order to extract these insights from the structure of a galaxy cluster observed at a given epoch , its formation process has to be understood in detail .",
    "one important aspect is the connection between the actual structure of dark matter haloes and the features of a given theory of structure formation . the density profile of a dark matter halo at a given epoch may be determined by the initial power spectrum as well as by the present density parameter @xmath2 and/or the value of the cosmological constant @xmath3 .",
    "such a dependence between the initial power spectrum and the density profiles of virialized objects was pointed out by hoffman & shaham ( 1985 ) and hoffman ( 1988 ) .",
    "their analytic work was based on the assumption of gaussian random fields with scale free power spectra @xmath4 .",
    "based on the secondary infall model of gunn & gott ( 1972 ) , and the self - similar solution of fillmore & goldreich ( 1984 ) and bertschinger ( 1985 ) , they found that the slope of the density profiles becomes steeper with increasing spectral index @xmath5 .",
    "analytic calculations , however , are based on simplifying assumptions ( e.g.spherical symmetry ) and , therefore , can not consider all aspects of gravitational collapse .",
    "n - body simulations , which begin with generic initial conditions , provide an attractive alternative .",
    "though the effects of gas dynamics are neglected , they are likely to represent a realistic description of the formation of galaxy clusters : observations suggest that dark matter dominates the mass of galaxy clusters and largely determines their gravitational potential . only in the highest density regions near the center of a cluster",
    "are the time scales sufficiently short that the cluster dynamics can be influenced by hydrodynamical effects .    within the last couple of years , multi - mass techniques",
    "have been developed which allow one to investigate the formation of individual clusters with high numerical resolution .",
    "( 1996a ) ( hereafter nfw ) have investigated the structure of dark matter haloes which form in a cold dark matter ( cdm ) universe ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "they found that the density profiles of haloes do not follow a power law , but tend to have a slope @xmath7 with @xmath0 near the cluster center and @xmath8 at large radii . over more the four orders of magnitude in mass ,",
    "the density profiles follow a universal law , which can be parameterized by @xmath9 the two free parameter are the scale radius @xmath10 which defines the scale where the profile shape changes from @xmath11 to @xmath12 and the characteristic overdensity @xmath13 .",
    "equation  ( [ nfw ] ) differs in its asymptotic behaviour at large radii from the profile @xmath14 which was proposed by hernquist ( 1990 ) to describe the mass profiles of elliptical galaxies .",
    "this profile has also been used by dubinsky & carlberg ( 1991 ) to fit the density distribution of haloes which were formed in their cdm - type simulation .",
    "lacey & cole ( 1996 ) extended the work of nfw to scale free power spectra with @xmath15 , and 0 in an @xmath16 cosmogony , though with a lower numerical resolution .",
    "( 1996 ) have done simulations with an @xmath17 scale free power spectrum and @xmath18 and with an even higher numerical resolution than nfw .",
    "recently , navarro , frenk and white ( 1996b ) extended their study to cosmogonies with @xmath19 and with a non - vanishing cosmological constant @xmath3 .",
    "haloes which form in all of these cosmological models seem to be well described by equation  ( [ nfw ] ) . the scale radius and the central overdensity seem to be related to the formation time of the halo ( navarro et al .",
    "these results suggest that the density profile found by nfw is quite generic for any scenario in which structures form due to hierarchical clustering .",
    "the power spectrum and cosmological parameters may only indirectly enter by specifying the typical formation epoch of a halo of a given mass .",
    "consequently , they possibly affect the profiles of galaxy clusters only by specifying the dependence of the characteristic radius @xmath20 on the total mass of a cluster .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the profiles of galaxy clusters and investigate the influence of the background cosmogony . models with @xmath19 and/or @xmath21 are considered as well as scenarios with a cold and a hot component .",
    "also a pure hot dark matter model is considered as an example of a cosmogony in which structure does not form hierarchically .",
    "we investigate the formation history of haloes and its dependence on the background cosmogony .",
    "we also present results for other gross properties such as the triaxiality and angular momentum of the haloes .",
    "their evolution is compared with the analytical predictions of the spherical top - hat model .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the different considered cosmogonies and briefly describe their impact on structure formation .",
    "section 3 presents the numerical techniques and discusses the issues of numerical resolution , time stepping and boundary conditions .",
    "section 4 investigates the collapse of individual haloes in detail showing the evolution of various halo properties .",
    "the structure of the haloes and their dependence on the background cosmogony is analysed in section 5 .",
    "we summarise our results and conclude in section 6 .",
    "seven cosmological models are studied in this paper .",
    "three of these are cold dark matter models ( cdm , ocdm and lcdm ) representing flat , open and @xmath3 dominated cosmologies .",
    "the three mixed dark matter models ( chdm i - iii ) contain differing number and masses of neutrino species .",
    "these models thus cover a broad range of hierarchical structure formation scenarios .",
    "the hdm model is added to investigate the formation of clusters in a cosmogony which does not follow the hierarchical scenario .",
    "table  [ tb1 ] gives the cosmological parameters defining the seven different cosmological models .",
    "it is far from obvious what is the best way to compare galaxy clusters as they form in different cosmological scenarios .",
    "potential choices involve comparing clusters of similar mass or similar @xmath22 , among others .",
    "the nonlinear mass @xmath23 is defined as the mass corresponding to the linear rms density fluctuation which exceeds the critical threshold @xmath24 for collapse at a given redshift in the spherical top - hat model ( eke et al .",
    "values for @xmath23 at @xmath25 are given in table  [ tb2 ] .",
    "all these criteria yield a different set of objects which are compared .",
    "the problems are further complicated by some freedom in the choice of the normalisation of the power spectrum ( e.g.cobe normalised versus normalised according to cluster abundance ) .",
    "finally , high resolution cluster simulations are still computationally expensive , and a numerical study is restricted to a few objects per cosmological scenario .",
    "differences in the formation history due to different realisations of a gaussian random field can be larger than those induced by the features of a individual cosmogony . in order to minimise these sampling effects",
    ", we use identical phases for the gaussian random field for each of the three considered realisations .",
    "each realisation corresponds to one massive cluster at @xmath26 . in the following",
    "we will refer to the realisations as realisation a , b and c. for the hdm model , 2 simulations have been performed , corresponding to realisations a and c.    we normalise all power spectra to @xmath27 , i.e. all models have the same linear extrapolated rms overdensity in top - hat spheres of radius @xmath28mpc .",
    "this normalisation reproduces the observed abundance of rich galaxy clusters ( white et al .",
    "1993 ) in the case of a high @xmath29 universe , but is low for the lcdm and ocdm models .",
    "recent results of eke et al .",
    "( 1996 ) suggest @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) for the lcdm ( ocdm ) . thus @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) for @xmath34 , which is larger than our choice by a factor of @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "similar results also hold for cobe normalisation . while the standard cdm scenario is inconsistent with the cobe measurements , the chdm sequences fit both cobe measurements and cluster abundances .",
    "a disadvantage of our normalisation is that clusters in different cosmological models have different masses and circular velocitys as shown in figure [ models ] .",
    "the models with @xmath19 have approximately a mass smaller by a factor of @xmath29 and a circular velocity smaller by @xmath37 than the @xmath18 cdm models .",
    "since @xmath23 is smaller by a similar amount , they have a similar @xmath22 as the cdm clusters , i.e.they are similarly rare events at @xmath26 .",
    "the clusters of the chdm models have a much higher @xmath22 and are , therefore , much rarer events .",
    "the simulations are done in a periodic cubic box with a side length of @xmath38mpc .",
    "the mass resolution is @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , a cluster with a mass of @xmath40 consists of 4000 particles .",
    "the spatial resolution set by the force softening and time stepping is @xmath41kpc .",
    "all simulations are started at a redshift of @xmath42 and end at the present time .",
    "after every increase of @xmath43 in the expansion factor an output of position , velocity , potential and force of the particles is stored , leading to a total of 20 outputs per simulation .",
    "the initial conditions for the cdm and chdm runs were generated using the cosmic code by bertschinger et al .",
    "for the lcdm cosmogony the power spectrum given by efstathiou et al .",

    "@xmath49 and @xmath50 are scaled to the value of the analytical fit at the scale radius .",
    "this enables a fair comparison of the haloes since under such a scaling all profiles which are fitted well by equation @xmath51 should have identical shapes .",
    "the solid lines in figure  [ figprfa ] represent these reference profiles based on the nfw profile .",
    "all profiles are very well fitted by the nfw profile up to the virial radius .",
    "larger deviations especially in form of spikes are produced by infalling subclumps ( tormen 1996 ) , or due to incomplete relaxation as in the case of the hdm a. both effects lead also to a larger error in @xmath10 .",
    "the general shape of the haloes follows the nfw profile is independent of the cosmogony .",
    "the only difference between the models is the concentration @xmath52 of haloes , characterized by the ratio of the viral radius to the scale length .",
    "@xmath53 is given in table  [ tb3 ] for all haloes .",
    "it can also be directly read off figure  [ figprfa ] looking at the x - values of the virial radii .",
    "a small value of @xmath53 means that the density in the center is lower compared to haloes with a high @xmath53 .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ figprfb ] , where the profiles of the circular velocity of the clusters of one realization are compared .",
    "for pure cold dark matter , there is a trend towards higher concentration from the cdm model to the lcdm and ocdm model .",
    "this trend can be well understood since the characteristic overdensity @xmath54 ( navarro et al .",
    "1996b ) where @xmath55 is the formation time of the halo .",
    "in @xmath56 universes structures form at an earlier epoch where the density of the universe is higher .",
    "the trend is most pronounced for the ocdm model , since in this scenario , structures form at the highest redshifts .",
    "there is also a strong correlation of @xmath53 with increasing influence of the hot component .",
    "the concentration becomes smaller as the hot dark matter becomes more dominant .",
    "structure formation is retarded to very low redshifts .    0.05=0.9    0.05=0.9      both the nfw and the hernquist profile have been shown to provide a fairly accurate fit to the radial matter distribution of haloes formed in hierarchically clustering scenarios , though the nfw profile seem to provide a slightly better fit , especially at large radii .",
    "we investigate more quantitatively the asymptotic behavior at large radii using a generalized form of the nfw profile : @xmath57 \\label{nvcf}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath58 the expression  ( [ nvcn ] ) has to be used for @xmath59 .",
    "we have thus introduced an additional free parameter @xmath60 which sets the asymptotic logarithmic slope @xmath61 of the profile at large radii . @xmath58 and @xmath62 correspond to the nfw and the hernquist profile , respectively .",
    "the physical meaning of the other two parameters , @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the same as that of @xmath10 and @xmath13 in the nfw profile , namely characteristic scale radius and central density .    by fitting equation ( [ gen ] )",
    "insidue @xmath65 to the measured profiles for all available haloes we get the distribution of @xmath60 . to enlarge the halo sample",
    "we include the most massive progenitor of each cluster identified in the outputs after @xmath66 . with our sampling rate of one output per @xmath67",
    "we get a total of @xmath68 haloes covering a mass range of @xmath69 to @xmath70 .",
    "the halo sample of each cluster realization is not strictly independent as these haloes belong to the same evolution path .",
    "due to the chosen sampling rate , however , the haloes are identified at different states of the evolution of a cluster .",
    "each halo has included different amount of nonlinearities and represents a different state of relaxation .",
    "furthermore , the asymptotic slope probes the outer part of a halo , which is mainly built up from the newly infalling matter .",
    "though not strictly independent , our enlarged sample can be considered to represent the typical amount of scatter in the asymptotic behaviour at large radii .",
    "the radial density distribution is similar in all of these objects as can be seen in figure  [ figtprof ] .",
    "here we plot the profiles of @xmath50 of the cdm a cluster at @xmath71 and of its most massive progenitors at seven earlier redshifts .",
    "the general shape of the profiles is comparable to the nfw profile , independent of redshift .    in figure  [ fignv ] the number distribution @xmath72 of the asymptotic slope of the profiles",
    "is plotted .",
    "the distribution is strongly peaked at @xmath58 , the value of the nfw profile .",
    "this peak is a common feature for all cosmologies .",
    "there is no relation between @xmath72 and redshift .",
    "we are thus led to conclude that the nfw profile has the best fit asymptotic slope at large @xmath73 , for a generalized profile of the form of equation ( [ gen ] ) .",
    "a different asymptotic behavior ( @xmath74 ) can be observed for haloes which participate in a merging event . merging subclumps",
    "change the matter distribution along the infall direction , which is visible as spikes in the radial profile as mention earlier .",
    "depending on the distance of the subclump relative to the halo center these spikes affect the asymptotic slope at large radii .",
    "a flattening of the profile results if a subclump is at radii slightly larger than @xmath75 ; on the other hand shortly after a subclump crosses @xmath76 , the resultant spike leads to a steeper outer profile .",
    "=    =      in the previous subsections we have demonstrated the universality of the measured density profiles of clusters . for @xmath77 , the flattening below a certain scale length and the asymptotic decay of the profiles",
    "are well described for more or less relaxed haloes by the nfw profile .",
    "this general form of the radial density distribution in a halo is independent of redshift and the cosmological model .",
    "the evolution path of a single halo also does not appear to affect the profile .",
    "recently syer & white ( 1996 ) have argued that the inner slope of the universal density profile arises from repeated mergers .",
    "the clusters we have simulated however have very different merging histories ; indeed the first collapsed objects and the entire haloes of our hdm simulations are formed without any significant mergers events . in this section",
    "we consider the role of non - radial motions in producing an nfw - like profile .    0.05=0.9    it is illustrative to examine the time evolution of the density profile in parallel with the velocity structure of the halo as measured from the mean radial velocity @xmath78 , and the radial [ @xmath79 and the transverse [ @xmath80 velocity dispersion of particles . in figure  [ figevol ]",
    "this evolution is shown for the ocdm c cluster .",
    "for the region where the most massive progenitor is formed , the profile of the density @xmath81 is plotted as a function of distance @xmath73 at different redshifts ( left panels ) .",
    "the middle panels shows the profiles of @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the right panel shows the profile of @xmath84 in comparison with the radial component of the gravitational force .",
    "figure  [ figevol ] shows how the development of a density profile like the nfw profile of equation [ nfw ] is accompanied by a transition from mainly radial infall of the halo particles to virialised motions with vanishing mean radial velocity . at @xmath85 all particles at radii below @xmath86mpc",
    "have turned around and are falling towards the density maximum .",
    "the density profile is not much steeper than a constant density profile ( the logarithmic slope @xmath87 ) .",
    "the first particles cross the central region before @xmath88 and move outwards again .",
    "due to the overlap of the particles crossing the center for the first time and those which have fallen in and out several times , the density increases in the center as described by the secondary infall model ( e.g. bertschinger 1985 ) .",
    "this results in the slope @xmath89 becoming lower than @xmath90 at radii below @xmath91 . at @xmath92",
    "a large clump starts to merge with the progenitor , as evident by the spike in the density profile at @xmath93mpc .",
    "by @xmath94 the slope has again become shallower than @xmath90 in the center while it remains steeper than @xmath90 for @xmath95 .",
    "the shape of the density profile below @xmath76 remains almost stable up to @xmath96 .",
    "merging events temporarily disturb this matter arrangement , but the density distribution inside always returns to the nfw form .    the velocity structure near the center changes during collapse as shown in the middle panels of figure  [ figevol ] . due to the mixing of inward and outward moving particles",
    "the mean radial velocity @xmath78 in the central region approaches zero at @xmath88 .",
    "after the first relaxed object has been formed ( at @xmath97 ) , @xmath78 fluctuates around zero for @xmath98 .",
    "the radial velocity dispersion @xmath99 increases with time at early times , but at late times ( @xmath100 ) remains constant at nearly @xmath101 km / s for all @xmath77 .",
    "the transverse velocity dispersion @xmath102 remains approximately equal to @xmath99 , though at late times it remains below @xmath99 in the outer parts of the halo .",
    "a `` centrifugal '' force , @xmath103 can be associated with the transverse velocities . at @xmath85 , the radial component of the gravitational force ,",
    "@xmath104 is approximately ten times larger in the center than @xmath105 , but it does not grow significantly ( see the right panels of figure  [ figevol ] ) . it can be approximated by @xmath106 , with the central mean density @xmath107 remaining almost constant . by @xmath108",
    ", @xmath105 becomes of the same order as @xmath109 for @xmath110 , and it becomes larger at later times .",
    "a close examination of the redshift interval between @xmath111 and @xmath26 ( not shown in the figure ) reveals that there is very little variation in time in the profiles of @xmath112 and @xmath113 : once the smooth profiles with a turnover at @xmath114 are established they remain the same up to @xmath26 .",
    "the tangential velocities cause particles to move on orbits which can be locally described as keplerian ellipses or hyperbolas .",
    "typical particle trajectories do not pass close to the center if @xmath115 is of the same order as @xmath104 or larger , and if the transverse velocity of the particles is of order the radial velocity .",
    "since particles at a given radius do not subsequently penetrate into the inner region of the halo they do not cause the density profile to steepen as much as it would if they were on radial orbits .",
    "one can relate the orbit structure of halo particles to the density profile that arises in idealised models of secondary infall .",
    "the profile predicted by the purely radial infall model ( fillmore & goldreich 1984 ; bertschinger 1985 ) is close to what is observed in the outer parts of our haloes . in the inner parts however the profile",
    "is flattened owing to the significant tangential velocities , as described above .",
    "this flattening is consistent with the results of white & zaritsky ( 1992 ) who included angular momentum into an infall model .",
    "they showed that whereas for purely radial infall , the profile does not become shallower than @xmath116 , the inclusion of sufficient angular momentum can allow the profile to be arbitrarily shallow ( depending on the initial profile ) .",
    "their analytical model was restricted to scale - free conditions and had an artificial prescription for adding angular momentum . by construction",
    "their model led to power law final profiles .",
    "in contrast the initial power spectrum we use is not scale - free ; there is no imposed spherical symmetry ; and the angular momentum is acquired dynamically .",
    "therefore we can only compare our profile to the predictions of infall models in a local , approximate sense .",
    "the comparison is nevertheless interesting because the slope of the nfw density profile at @xmath117 is @xmath116 , precisely the value at which the secondary infall model shows a transition from an infall profile dominated by radial motions , to one with significant tangential motions .",
    "we have shown in figure  [ figevol ] that @xmath117 does mark a transition in the relative importance of the `` centrifugal '' force due to the tangential velocity dispersion and the radial component of the graviational force .",
    "the emergence of this transition coincides with that of an nfw - like profile with a slope that is shallower than @xmath90 in the inner regions , and both features are stable over time once they appear at @xmath118 .",
    "thus there are two qualitative changes in the density profile as haloes evolve from @xmath119 to the present : the initial steepening as mainly radial infall sets in , and the subsequent flattening of the inner profile as tangential motions become significant .",
    "both features are in accord with infall models , and do not appear to be disturbed by ongoing mergers .",
    "the same features are present in all the cluster haloes , and most significantly in the hdm haloes which have much less merging but produce very similar profiles .",
    "these qualitative features argue against the merger mechanism proposed by syer & white ( 1996 ) to explain the formation of nfw - like profiles .    in the context of a violent relaxation scenario of halo formation , the non - radial motions of halo particles would be induced by mostly stochastic torques due to matter anisotropies .",
    "an alternative possibility is the radial orbit instability ( e.g. carpintero & muzzio 1995 ) which exists even in the absence of large scale fluctuations in the potential .",
    "it is important to understand the origin of the torques that produce these tangential motions before they can be regarded as the dynamical agent in forming the density profile .",
    "we plan to experiment with halo collapse simulations from varying initial conditions to establish if the mechanism that produces an nfw - like profile is distinct from one in which mergers play the dominant role , though clearly both processes operate in the evolution of dark matter haloes .",
    "we have investigated the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters in different cosmogonies by means of numerical simulations .",
    "the investigated cosmogonies include standard cold dark matter models ( @xmath18 ) , open models ( @xmath34 ) , models with a cosmological constant ( @xmath34 , @xmath120 ) , 3 mixed dark matter models with differing @xmath121 and differing number of massive neutrino species as well as a pure hot dark matter model ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "3 different realisations of each model have been investigated .",
    "the simulation have been performed using newly developed high resolution n - body code which combines a pm code with a high resolution tree code or a direct summation n - body code based on the special purpose hardware grape .",
    "high spatial and mass resolution is achieved by using an enhanced multi - mass technique and a hierarchically nested particle arrangement .",
    "test simulations demonstrate that our chosen softening and time stepping are consistent and that results have numerically converged .    in all considered cosmogonies , except the hot dark matter model , structure forms due to hierarchical clustering . for identical phases of the gaussian random field",
    "the evolution pattern of the halo formation is similar .",
    "differences in the cosmological parameters and the power spectra mainly manifest in a different time evolution , but the merging pattern , like e.g.number of mergers and mass ratio of mergers is fairly similar .",
    "consistent with the predictions of linear theory , the evolution proceeds earlier in models with @xmath19 , while in mixed dark matter models the evolution is retarded to low redshifts .",
    "as expected the evolution pattern of the hdm clusters is different as it is dominated by the initially smooth distribution of particles .",
    "the differences between individual realisations of a given cosmological model are large and much stronger than differences within differing cosmogonies for a given realisation .",
    "gross properties of clusters like size or angular momentum can be well described by analytic models like , e.g. , the spherical top hat model .    at all considered redshifts ,",
    "the density profile of the virialised portion of a galaxy clusters can be well described by the nfw profile ( navarro et al .",
    "1996a ) , which has a slope of @xmath0 near the center and of @xmath1 at large radii .",
    "the nfw profile provides a very good description for all considered cosmogonies and the influence of the background cosmological model only influences the central matter concentration and the characteristic radius . due to their earlier formation epoch ,",
    "low @xmath29 models are typically more concentrated than high @xmath29 cdm modes .",
    "analogously , mixed dark matter models are slightly less concentrated due to their retarded formation epoch .",
    "our results extend earlier findings to other cosmological models and supports the interpretation that the nfw profile is generic for all hierarchically clustering scenarios .",
    "it is suggested that the characteristic radius @xmath10 and the shallow density profile ( @xmath122 ) for @xmath123 are linked to the non - radial motions of particles .",
    "the mechanism that produces the tangential velocity dispersion of infalling particles and its possible dynamical role in the evolution of the density profile merits further investigation .",
