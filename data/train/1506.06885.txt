    "the understanding of the microscopic foundation of fourier s law is a longstanding problem in statistical physics .",
    "one of the promising ways along this direction is the study of heat conduction in low dimensional nonlinear lattices @xcite . among the investigations ,",
    "an interesting perspective is to find a nonlinear lattice which displays normal heat conduction , namely , where fourier s law holds . after numerous numerical simulations @xcite ,",
    "a consensus that one - dimensional ( 1d ) nonlinear lattices with on - site potentials can establish normal heat conduction has been reached . unraveling the microscopic mechanism of heat transfer across such momentum - nonconserving ( mnc ) lattices",
    "thus may provide crucial insights to the foundation of fourier s law .",
    "phenomenologically @xcite , the heat conductivity @xmath1 can be approximately obtained via the peierls formula , i.e. , @xmath2 , here @xmath3 is the phonon wave number , @xmath4 the specific heat of the phonon mode , @xmath5 its phonon group velocity and @xmath6 the corresponding mean free path ( mfp ) . following this spirit ,",
    "a theoretical proposal for phonon heat transport based on renormalized phonon has been carried out @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , flaws in its phonon description @xcite may produce wrong phonon information , which limits its ability and generality . trying to understand the process of heat conduction from the phonon point of view",
    ", theoretical investigations on the phonon properties seems to be a necessary step .",
    "thus a unified phonon theory which is capable of dealing with various nonlinear lattices is of primary interest and importance at present stage .",
    "however , the attempts concerning phonon properties in mnc lattices are less @xcite , compared with studies carried on momentum - conserving ( mc ) counterparts exhibiting anomalous heat conduction @xcite .",
    "more efforts should be devoted to the former .    in a previous study @xcite , we have demonstrated the advantages of a variational approach in describing renormalized phonons in mc nonlinear lattices with either symmetric or asymmetric nearest - neighbor potentials compared with existing quasi - harmonic theories . moreover , besides our method , we found that the nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics ( nfh ) @xcite can also provide good estimation for the sound velocity of mc nonlinear lattices .",
    "since the concept of sound velocity is invalid in mnc nonlinear lattices , we deduce that the nfh can not be able to give information of the renormalized phonons , although it can still describe correlation functions of these systems @xcite .",
    "therefore , an interesting question arises whether the variational approach can be exploited for this class of models .",
    "the purpose of this work is thus twofold : ( i)by putting the proposed variational approach onto a more general ground , we show that mnc nonlinear lattices can be tackled within the framework of the variational approach , which makes our theory a candidate for a unified phonon theory , and ( ii ) we determine temperature - dependent phonon properties of mnc nonlinear lattices using this method and confirm the validity of so - obtained results with the aids of molecule dynamics ( md ) simulations as well as a tuning fork method @xcite . as a demonstration",
    ", we consider one of archetype 1d nonlinear lattices in classical statistical mechanics , namely , 1d @xmath0 lattice .",
    "we conclude that the approach opens a new perspective to understand renormalized phonons in various nonlinear lattices .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the general aspects of the extended variational approach .",
    "two intrinsic relation satisfied by the optimal reference systems are revealed such that general nonlinear lattice can be tackled .",
    "explicit forms of optimal variational parameters are also obtained . in sec.iii , we focus on a comprehensive study of a specific nonlinear lattice , namely , the 1d @xmath0 lattice .",
    "we found a power - law temperature dependence of the phonon band gap valid in the weak stochasticity regime as well as a rigorous relation between ensemble averages of the nonlinear lattice .",

    "notice that lattices with asymmetric interparticle potentials ( @xmath22 ) will induce nonvanishing internal pressure , here we only consider lattices with symmetric ones .",
    "the extension to systems involving asymmetric potentials is straightforward @xcite .",
    "accordingly , nonlinear potentials with the following forms are of special interest : @xmath23 coefficients are chosen in such a way that potentials exhibit a single - well character .    in order to utilize a variational approach , the basic",
    "routine is to introduce a reference system with a trial hamiltonian @xmath24 and prepare the nonlinear system and the reference system at the same temperature , then determines optimal reference systems from variational principles @xcite , the resulting optimal variational parameters inevitably take temperature dependence .    for systems with zero pressure , the helmholtz free energy @xmath25 determines its thermodynamic properties . since nonlinear lattices in thermal equilibrium",
    "behave like weakly interacting renormalized phonons @xcite , the free energy of the nonlinear lattices can be divided into two parts , one is the contribution of the free renormalized phonon gas described by a harmonic hamiltonian , the other comes from the phonon - phonon interaction .",

    "the trial hamiltonian @xmath24 contains a set of adjustable parameters @xmath33 , an optimal reference system can be obtained by varying those parameters such that bounds of the variational principle go to a relative minimum or maximum . generally , without specific forms of @xmath34 and @xmath24 , the condition for the bounds [ c.f .",

    "<S> two intrinsic identities characterizing optimal reference systems are revealed , which enables us to derive explicit expressions for optimal variational parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting optimal harmonic reference systems provide information for the band gap as well as the dispersion of renormalized phonons in nonlinear lattices . as a demonstration </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the one - dimensional @xmath0 lattice . by combining the transfer integral operator method </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the phonon band gap endows a simple power - law temperature dependence in the weak stochasticity regime where predicted dispersion is reliable by comparing with numerical results . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , an exact relation between ensemble averages of the @xmath0 lattice in the whole temperature range is found , regardless of the existence of the strong stochasticity threshold . </S>"
