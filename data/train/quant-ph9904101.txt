    "first ( in sec .  [ buressection ] ) , we derive ( prior ) probability distributions of particular interest over both the three - dimensional convex set of two - state quantum systems and the eight - dimensional convex set of three - state quantum systems .",
    "these distributions are the normalized volume elements of the corresponding bures metrics on these systems .",
    "hall @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) has contended that such distributions correspond to `` minimal - knowledge '' ensembles , that is the most _ random _ ensembles of possible states . in particular , for the two - dimensional quantum systems , he argues that the bures metric provides such a minimal - knowledge ensemble , since it `` corresponds to the surface of a unit four - ball , i. e. , to the maximally symmetric space of positive curvature  this space is homogeneous and isotropic , and hence the bures metric does not distinguish a preferred location or direction in the space of density operators '' @xcite .",
    "somewhat contrarily though , slater @xcite has reported results ( based on the concept of comparative noninformativities of priors , first expounded in @xcite ) that indicate the bures metric generates ensembles that are less noninformative than other ( monotone ) metrics of interest .",
    "the bures metric fulfills the role of the _ minimal _ monotone metric @xcite , and has been the focus of a considerable number of studies @xcite .",

    "( suitably normalized ) operator montone functions @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , there is a minimal and a maximal one @xcite .",
    "( the concept of a minimal metric was apparently introduced by zolotarev in his extensive paper , `` metric distances in spaces of random variables and of their distributions '' @xcite , but it is not entirely clear that the meaning there is the same as in the terminology `` minimal monotone metric '' . )    we should bear in mind , though  as emphasized by petz and sudr @xcite  that , in strong contrast to the classical situation , in the quantum domain there is not a unique monotone metric , but rather a ( nondenumerable ) multiplicity of them .",
    "their comparative properties need to be evaluated , before deciding which specific one to employ for a particular application .",
    "we repeat the concluding remarks of petz and sudr : `` therefore , more than one privileged metric shows up in quantum mechanics .",
    "the exact clarification of this point requires and is worth further studies . ''",
    "we have previously reported @xcite ( in terms of parameterizations other than that of boya _ et al _ @xcite ) the bures probability distribution for the two - state systems , and also @xcite for an imbedding of these systems into a four - dimensional convex set of three - state systems , but the result below ( [ new ] ) for the full eight - dimensional convex set of three - state systems is clearly novel in nature .",
    "in fact , in ( * ? ? ? * e ) we discussed certain ( unsuccessful ) efforts in these directions ( although the volume element of the _ maximal _ monotone metric  which is not strictly normalizable  proved more amenable to analysis there ) .    in sec .",
    "[ bureshallsection ] , we determine certain necessary elements for extending the work reported in sec .  [ buressection ] to the higher - dimensional quantum systems ( @xmath18 ) .",

    "it would , therefore , certainly be of substantial interest to find a general formula for @xmath4 .",
    "knowledge of the value of @xmath4 , together with that of the invariant haar element for @xmath19  apparently presently available , however , in suitably parameterized form ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) for @xmath20 @xcite  would allow one to construct the bures prior probability distribution itself for the @xmath5-level quantum systems .",
    "in an extensive study @xcite , krattenthaler and slater examined ( in the framework of the _ two_-state systems ) the hypothesis that the normalized volume element of the bures metric would function in the quantum domain in a role parallel to that fulfilled classically by the `` jeffreys prior ''  that is , the normalized volume element of the unique monotone / fisher information metric @xcite . in particular , they were interested in @xcite in the possibility of extending certain ( classical ) seminal results of clarke and barron @xcite",
    ". they did conclude , however , contrary to their working hypothesis , that the normalized volume element of the bures metric does not in fact strictly fullfill the same role as the jeffreys prior ( in yielding both the asymptotic minimax and maximin redundancies for universal coding / data compression ) , but it appears to come remarkably close to doing so ( cf .",

    "now , in performing ( the apparently necessary ) numerical ( as opposed to symbolic ) integrations to obtain the hall constants @xmath4 @xmath101 , it seems to be considerably more computationally effective to integrate over only those diagonal matrices in which ( say ) the ( 1,1)-entry is no less than the ( 2,2)-entry , which in turn is no less than the ( 3,3)-entry , _ etc . _ ( this helps to minimize troublesome oscillations . ) then , the result can be multiplied by the number ( @xmath102 ) of permutations of @xmath5 objects to yield @xmath4 , since the result of the integration must be invariant under any other of the @xmath103 possible orderings ( permutations ) that can be imposed on the diagonal entries of the @xmath0 diagonal matrices . in precisely this manner , we were able to obtain ( using the numerical integration of interpolating function command of mathematica ) the result @xmath104 for @xmath9 .",
    "this we take as overwhelming evidence that @xmath9 , in fact , equals @xmath105 , particularly so , since 71,680 has the highly structured prime decomposition of @xmath106 .",
    "( it is also interesting to note that @xmath94 appears in the numerator of @xmath107 , that is , @xmath108 , or , to the same effect , @xmath109 .    to illustrate the procedure followed ,",

    "of course , as the dimensionality of the @xmath5-state quantum systems increases ( that is , @xmath5 itself increases ) , the numerical integrations required to sufficiently narrow estimates of the corresponding hall constant become increasingly more difficult , and it is hard to judge what is precisely the optimum numerical / programming strategy to employ . following the methodology outlined in sec .

    "the reciprocal of the corresponding `` morozova - chentsov function '' @xmath203 @xcite for ( [ wsquiggle ] ) is the exponential or identric mean ( * ? ? ?",

    "the associated operator monotone functions @xcite are @xmath207 for the bures",

    "( the morozova - chentsov functions fulfill the relation @xmath209 . ) perhaps the _ exponential _ mean arises in this context because the von neumann entropy is the _ logarithmic _ relative entropy , and of course the exponential and logarithmic functions are inverses of one another .",
    "this leads us to speculate that if one were to employ , following @xcite , the `` quadratic relative entropy '' or the `` bures relative entropy '' instead , then , in the parallel universal coding context , the minimax / maximin would be achieved by the means corresponding to the new forms of inverse functions .",
    "while the logarithmic relative entropy is based on the operator convex function , @xmath210 , the quadratic form relies upon @xmath211 and the bures form on @xmath212 @xcite . here , @xmath213 .    in fig .",
    "[ comparison ] , we jointly display the univariate marginal probability distributions of ( [ n2 ] ) and ( [ wsquiggle ] ) , revealing that they closely resemble one another , with the quasi - bures distribution assigning relatively greater probability to the states more pure in character ( @xmath214 ) .",
    "the three - state counterpart of ( [ wsquiggle ] ) ( that is , the probability distribution associated with the exponential / identric mean , rather than the arithmetic mean , as for such bures distributions ) is @xmath215 @xmath216 where @xmath217 is given in ( [ newvariable ] ) , @xmath218 in ( [ conditionalhaar ] ) and @xmath219 the corresponding two - dimensional marginal probability distribution over the variables @xmath65 and @xmath66 is exhibited in fig .",

    "then ( taking @xmath224 $ ] and not @xmath225 $ ] as in @xcite ) , rather than @xmath226 , we obtain .769427 , and for @xmath46 , instead of @xmath227 , we find .138681 .",
    "we hypothesize that the ( full eight - dimensional ) quasi - bures probability distribution ( [ quasibures ] ) associated with fig .

    "@xcite ) . in this regard , it might prove computationally convenient , as a heuristic device , to replace the quasi - bures probablity distributions by their ( closely approximating ) bures analogues , since certain exact ( symbolic ) integrations are achievable ( at least , for the cases @xmath228 ) with the bures distributions , but apparently not with the quasi - bures ones , for which numerical methods seem to be necessary .    although a parameterization of su(4 ) is not relevant , as already noted , to the computation of the hall constant @xmath9 , that is , @xmath105 , and to that of the corresponding average ( von neumann ) entropy ( sec .",
    "[ entropy ] ) , it would be essential in investigating the universal coding of four - state quantum systems , since the tensor products of @xmath110 density matrices have to be calculated and it would , therefore , be necessary to implement formula ( [ one ] ) . in a personal communication",
    ", m. byrd has indicated that he has undertaken the ( challenging ) task of developing such an ( euler angle ) parameterization of @xmath229 .",
    "such a parameterization of @xmath229  in conjunction with the knowledge , acquired here , of @xmath9  might also prove of value in estimating the volume of @xmath99 separable quantum states @xcite and lead to numerically more stable results than those reported in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table i ) , since the `` over - parameterizations '' of the unitary matrices used there could then be avoided , due to the `` dropping out '' ( as pointed out for @xmath230 immediately after ( [ ranges ] ) above ) of certain euler angles in the formation of the product ( [ one ] ) .",
    "we also note that in @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , the bures ( minimal monotone ) metric was found to yield higher _ a priori _ probabilities of entanglement than other monotone metrics ( in particular , the kubo - mori - bogoliubov and maximal ones ) . presumably , even in any computationally improved form of analysis , this conclusion would be unaltered .",
    "we have also pursued a traditional ( pseudo - random number ) monte carlo approach to estimating the hall normalization constants for @xmath231 .",
    "however , the degrees of precision attained were not satisfactory .",
    "( for discussions of the comparative computational complexities of the pseudo- and quasi - monte carlo methods , see @xcite . )",
