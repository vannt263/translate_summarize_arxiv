    "it is widely known that fading is an effect that significantly degrades communication signals during wireless propagation .",
    "a common approach for accounting for this phenomenon has been possible through exploitation of suitable statistical distributions . to this effect",
    ", statistical models such as rayleigh , nagakami-@xmath5 , weibull and nakagami - q ( hoyt ) have been shown to be capable of modelling small - scale fading in _ non - line - of - sight _ ( nlos ) communication scenarios whereas nakagami-@xmath8 ( rice ) distribution has been typically utilized in characterizing multipath fading in _ line - of - sight _ ( los ) communication scenarios , @xcite and the references therein . capitalizing on these models ,",
    "m. d. yacoub proposed three generalised fading models , namely , the @xmath3 , the @xmath4 , the @xmath9 models and subsequently the @xmath10 and the @xmath4 _ extreme _ models , @xcite .",
    "these models along with the recently proposed @xmath1 _ extreme _ fading model in @xcite are useful thanks to the remarkable flexibility offered by their named parameters which render them capable of providing adequate fittings to results obtained by field measurements .",
    "their usefulness is also evident by the fact that they include as special cases all the above small - scale fading distributions .",
    "+ it is recalled here that a fundamental principle of wireless radio propagation is that multipath and shadowing effects occur simultaneously . as a result , in spite of the undoubted usefulness of the aforementioned fading models , they all ultimately fail to account concurrently for both shadowing and multipath fading . in other words ,",
    "the characterisation offered by the aforementioned fading models is limited to modelling either the one or the other effect .",
    "based on this crucial limitation , the need for composite statistical models that can provide adequate characterization of the fading effect as a whole became necessary @xcite . + motivated by this , the authors in @xcite proposed the rayleigh@xmath2gamma fading model , which is also known as @xmath11-distibution , @xmath12 . in the same context ,",
    "shankar in @xcite exploited the flexibility of nakagami-@xmath5 distribution , which includes rayleigh distribution as a special case and introduced the nakagami-@xmath13gamma composite distribution - or generalised @xmath11-distribution , @xmath14 .",
    "likewise , the weibull@xmath2gamma composite distribution was reported in @xcite while the @xmath6gamma , the @xmath4 _ _ extreme__@xmath2gamma , the @xmath15gamma and the @xmath16gamma distributions were proposed in @xcite .",
    "+ the aim of this work is the derivation of novel analytic results for the @xmath0gamma composite fading model .",
    "subsequently , by using this model as a basis , the @xmath7gamma and the @xmath1 _ _ extreme__@xmath2gamma composite fading distributions are additionally derived .",
    "importantly , unlike all existing composite fading models , this models are capable of accounting for the non - linearity of the wireless fading channel which is characterized by the parameter @xmath17 . after formulating these models , novel analytic expressions are derived for their corresponding probability density function ( pdf ) .",
    "the validity of the offered expressions is justified through comparisons with numerical results while their behaviour is assessed under different parametric scenarios .",
    "importantly , owing to the relatively convenient algebraic representation of the offered expressions , they can be considered useful mathematical tools that can be efficiently utilized in studies related to the analytical performance evaluation of digital communications over non - linear multipath@xmath2shadowing and severe composite fading models .",
    "indicatively , they can be exclusively employed in the derivation of algebraically complex analytic expressions for various performance measures such as error probability , channel capacity and higher order statistics , to name a few @xcite .",
    "+ the remainder of this paper is organised as follows : section ii revisits the foundations of @xmath1 and the gamma distributions .",
    "subsequently , sections iii , iv and v are devoted to the formulation and analytical derivation of the @xmath0gamma , the @xmath7gamma and the @xmath1 _ _ extreme__@xmath2gamma fading models , respectively . finally , discussions on the potential applicability of the derived expressions in wireless communications along with closing remarks are given in section vi .",
    "the @xmath1 distribution is a recently proposed fading model that accounts for the characterization of small - scale variations of mobile radio signals in los communication scenarios .",
    "it is written in terms of three physical parameters , namely @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ; the first one denotes the non - linearity parameter , @xmath19 is related to the multipath clustering while @xmath18 represents the ratio between the total power of the dominant components and the total power of the scattered waves . for a fading signal with envelope @xmath20 and @xmath21 ,",
    "the @xmath1 envelope pdf is given by @xcite ,    @xmath22    where @xmath23 denotes expectation , @xmath24 is the root - mean - square @xmath25 value of @xmath20 and @xmath26 represents the modified bessel function of the first kind with argument @xmath27 and order @xmath28 @xcite . for the case of normalised envelope @xmath29 ,",
    "equation can be equivalently expressed as    @xmath30    while the corresponding cdf is expressed as ,    @xmath31    where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the upper incomplete gamma function and the generalized marcum @xmath34-function which are defined as @xcite .",
    "importantly , the @xmath1 fading model includes as specific cases the more widely known @xmath3 and @xmath4 generalized models @xcite . in more details , for the specific case that @xmath35 , the @xmath1 distribution reduces to the more widely known @xmath4 fading model .",
    "likewise , for the specific case @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the nakagami-@xmath5 distribution is deduced while for @xmath38 one obtains the rayleigh distribution . in the same context , the rice distribution can be obtained by setting @xmath39 ( where k denotes the rice parameter ) as well as for the specific case @xmath36 and @xmath40 .",
    "finally , the weibull distribution can be obtained by setting @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "+ by setting @xmath43 according to @xcite , the corresponding power ( pdf ) is deduced in a straightforward manner , namely ,    @xmath44    in the same context , the corresponding statistical moments are given explicitly by ,    @xmath45 = \\frac{\\gamma\\left(\\frac{l}{\\alpha } + \\mu \\right)\\,_{1}f_{1}\\left(\\frac{l}{\\alpha } , \\mu , \\kappa \\mu \\right)}{e^{\\mu \\kappa}(1+\\kappa)^{l/ \\alpha}\\mu^{l/ \\alpha}}\\gamma(\\mu)\\ ] ]    where the notation @xmath46 denotes the kummer confluent hypergeometric function , @xcite .",
    "+ finally , it is recalled that the nakagami parameter @xmath5 is regarded as the inverse of the variance of the normalized power of the fading signal , i.e. @xmath47 , @xcite .",
    "this term is linked with the @xmath18 and @xmath19 parameters through the following relationship ,    @xmath48    as already mentioned , the @xmath1 fading model includes as a special case the @xmath1 _ extreme _ distribution which subsequently includes the @xmath4 _ extreme _ model for @xmath36 . it is recalled that the validity of this model is based on that the occurrence of large number of paths is not typically the case in wireless radio propagation over enclosed environments such as aeroplanes , trains and buses @xcite .",
    "the reason underlying this principle is that such environments are known to be characterised by only a few number of paths . as a consequence , severe fading conditions , even worse than rayleigh , are ultimately constituted @xcite . the envelope pdf of the @xmath4 fading model was derived in @xcite and is given by ,    @xmath49    while the @xmath1 model which additionally includes the non - linearity of the wireless channel was recently proposed in @xcite and is defined as follows ,    @xmath50    for @xmath35 equation reduces to .",
    "it is recalled that log - normal distribution has been regarded the optimum statistical model for characterising the shadowing effect , @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in spite of its usefulness , it has been largely shown that when it is involved in combination with other elementary and/or special function , its algebraic representation becomes intractable .",
    "this is particularly the case in studies related to the analytical derivation of critical performance measures in the field of digital communications over fading channels .",
    "motivated by this , the authors in @xcite proposed the gamma distribution as an accurate substitute to log - normal distribution .",
    "mathematically , the envelope pdf of gamma distribution is given by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 4 ) ) , namely ,    @xmath51    where the term @xmath52 is its shaping parameter and @xmath53 .",
    "the gamma fading model has been shown to provide adequate fitting to experimental data that correspond to realistic fading conditions .",
    "in addition , it is evident that its algebraic representation is quite tractable and therefore , easy to handle both analytically and numerically . as a result , it has been undoubtedly useful in characterising shadowing and for this reason it has been exploited in the formulation of the @xmath11 and @xmath54 composite multipath / shadowing models , @xcite .",
    "according to the basic principles of statistics , the envelope pdf of a composite statistical distribution is deduced by the superposition of two or more statistical distributions . in the present case , this is realized by superimposing one multipath and one shadowing distribution .",
    "mathematically , this principle is expressed as ,    @xmath55    where @xmath56 denotes the corresponding multipath distribution with mode @xmath57 .",
    "based on this principle , the corresponding @xmath58/gamma composite fading distribution is formulated by firstly setting in , @xmath59 and @xmath60 and then substituting in along with equation . to this end , it follows that ,    @xmath61    where    @xmath62    by setting in , @xmath63 and thus , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the above expression can be equivalently re - written as follows :    @xmath66      it is evident from that the derivation of an analytic expression for the envelope pdf of the @xmath0gamma distribution is subject to evaluation of the involved integral . to this end , it is recalled the the @xmath26 function can be equivalently represented in terms of the infinite series in ( * ? ? ?",

    "as already mentioned , analytic expressions for the pdf of the @xmath6gamma distribution was reported recently in @xcite . by recalling that the @xmath4 distribution is a special case of the @xmath1 distribution , an additional analytic expression for the pdf of @xmath6gamma distribution",
    "can be obtained by setting @xmath35 in .",
    "therefore , one obtains straightforwardly ,    @xmath79    the above expression could be useful in cases that the analytic expressions in @xcite are analytically intractable since although the meijer g - functions are considered rather laborious , they commonly allow the derivation of corresponding solutions in closed - form .",

    "it is recalled that the @xmath1 _ extreme _ fading model emerges from the @xmath1 distribution and accounts for severe fading conditions that typically occur in enclosed environments .",
    "it constitutes a generalization of the @xmath4 _ extreme _ distribution since it additionally considers the non - linearity effects of the wireless medium .",
    "the basic principle underlying this model is that the clt is not valid since the number of multipaths is rather low .",
    "however , likewise the @xmath85 distribution , the @xmath1 _ extreme _ fading model does not account for the simultaneous occurrence of shadowing .",
