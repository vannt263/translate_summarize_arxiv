    "the nucleus of the dwarf galaxy  ( filippenko & sargent 1989 ) lies at the edge of the parameters space formed by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . it is among the nearest ( @xmath9 ; thim 2004 ) and lowest luminosity ( @xmath10 ; moran 1999 ; lira 1999 ) seyfert galaxies known , and harbours a central black hole with a mass probably in the range @xmath11 ( filippenko & ho 2003 ) , which compares to more luminous seyfert galaxies with black hole masses typically in the range @xmath12 ( wandel , peterson & malkan 1999 ) .",
    "in addition , it shows some of the strongest x - ray variability of any radio - quiet agn ( iwasawa 2000 ; shih , iwasawa & fabian 2003 ) with variations of nearly an order of magnitude in a few thousand seconds . yet in other respects , such as optical and ultraviolet emission ( and absorption ) line properties",
    ", it resembles its more luminous counterparts ( filippenko & sargent 1989 ; crenshaw 2004 ) .",
    "the x - ray variations of seyfert galaxies are characterised by a ` red noise ' power spectrum ( lawrence 1987 ; m@xmath13hardy 1989 ) , approximated by a steep power law at high frequencies [ @xmath14 with an index @xmath1 breaking to a flatter index @xmath15 below some break frequency @xmath16 ( e.g. edelson & nandra 1999 ; nandra & papadakis 2001 ; uttley , m@xmath13hardy & papadakis 2002 ; vaughan , fabian & nandra 2003 ; markowitz 2003 ; m@xmath13hardy 2004 ) .",
    "the prevailing hypothesis is that @xmath16 scales inversely with the mass of the black hole ( or , equivalently , the break timescale scales with @xmath17 )",
    ". indeed , the limited data to date are consistent with a simple scaling relation for all black holes , from galactic black holes ( gbhs ) in x - ray binaries ( @xmath18 ; m@xmath19clintock & remillard 2004 ) to supermassive black holes in agn ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "if this relation holds then the break timescales in seyferts may be used to infer the mass of the central black hole by comparison with the power spectra of well studied gbhs such as cygnus x-1 ( belloni & hasinger 1990 ; nowak 1999 ) which contains a @xmath21 black hole ( herrero 1995 ) . uncovering the dependence of the characteristic variability frequencies with the fundamental source parameters ( mass , luminosity , accretion rate , etc . )",
    "may help clarify the origin of the variability itself .    however , this simple hypothesis is difficult to test ( see discussions in markowitz 2003 ; m@xmath13hardy 2004 and papadakis 2004 ) .",
    "gbhs typically possess masses @xmath22 whereas the majority of the well studied seyfert galaxies have masses @xmath23 .",
    "thus the @xmath24 region of parameter space remains unexplored .",
    ", with its unusually low mass black hole , falls in this critical region .",
    "previous studies of its x - ray variability ( shih 2003 ) using suggested the expected power spectral break was present ( at @xmath25  hz ) , but this was poorly determined due to the interrupted sampling of the data ( caused by the periodic earth occulations and saa passages of the low earth orbit ) .",

    "extraction of science products from the observation data files ( odfs ) followed standard procedures using the  science analysis system v5.6.0 ( sas ) .",
    "the data were taken with the epic cameras in full - frame mode .",
    "the field of  contains several other bright x - ray sources , although the nucleus itself is not confused by these in the epic pn image .",
    "source data were therefore extracted from the pn image using a circular region ( of radius @xmath30 arcsec ) around the centroid of the nuclear source .",
    "only events corresponding to patterns @xmath31 ( single and double pixel events ) were used for the pn analysis .",
    "background events were extracted from a region on the same ccd unaffected by source photons . these showed the background to be relatively low and stable throughout the first @xmath32 ks of the observation . during the final @xmath33  ks ( as the spacecraft approached the radiation belts at perigee ) the background rate increased dramatically ; these data were ignored for the present analysis .",
    "the final extracted dataset contained @xmath34 source counts .",
    "the source count rate was low enough that pile - up effects were negligible .",
    "light curves were extracted from the epic pn data in four different energy bands : @xmath35  kev ( full band ) , @xmath36  kev ( soft band ) , @xmath37  kev ( medium band ) and @xmath38  kev ( hard band ) .",
    "these were corrected for telemetry drop outs ( less than @xmath39 per cent of the total time ) , background subtracted and binned to @xmath40  s time resolution .",

    "cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the monte carlo fitting procedure discussed by vaughan ( 2003a ; see also green 1999 and uttley 2002 ) was also used to fit these data .",
    "this takes into account any power spectral distortion due to the time sampling of the data .",
    "however , in the case of  there were found to be no differences in best - fitting model parameters between the simple ( analytical ) and robust ( monte carlo ) fitting techniques .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "the first is that aliasing is negligible due to the fact the data are contiguously binned from an ( effectively ) continuous photon counting signal ( van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "the second is that red noise leak was not present because the power spectrum was flat @xmath50 at the lowest measured frequencies ; leakage is only substantial when the low frequency power spectrum remains steep ( @xmath51 ; uttley 2002 ) . given that the binned periodogram is free from distortion , the simple fitting was used over the monte carlo method because it is substantially faster and allowed for a much larger grid of model parameters to be computed in a reasonable amount of processing time .",
    "( for most other seyferts , where the power spectrum remains steep at the lowest frequencies probed by , the monte carlo method should be used . )      the cross - spectrum is closely related to the power spectrum .",
    "it offers a comparison between two simultaneously sampled time series ( such as x - ray light curves in different energy bands ) in frequency space .",
    "the modulus of the cross - spectrum is used to define the coherence ( vaughan & nowak 1997 ) , a measure of the degree of correlation between variations in the two time series .",
    "if one dataset is simply a delayed or smoothed copy of the other , the coherence will be unity .",
    "if the two datasets reflect totally independent variations the coherence will be zero .",
    "the cross - spectrum can also be used to measure the phase lag , or the time delay between the two time series ( assuming they are reasonable coherent ) . the coherence and phase lags of gbhs",
    "have been discussed by e.g. nowak ( 1999 ) and examined in seyfert galaxies by papadakis , nandra & kazanas ( 2001 ) , vaughan ( 2003a ) , vaughan & fabian ( 2002 ) and m@xmath13hardy ( 2004 ) .",
    "cross - spectrum estimates .",
    "clearly at low frequencies the coherence is high @xmath52 in between all the bands . at the highest frequencies",
    "the affect of poisson noise makes it difficult to measure the intrinsic coherence .",
    "[ fig : coh],width=6 ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : coh ] shows the coherence between the three different energy bands for .",
    "clearly at low frequencies the variations are highly coherent ( @xmath53 ) , while at high frequencies the coherence becomes increasingly difficult to measure due to the relatively stronger contribution from poisson noise .",
    "the coherence was calculated using the method of vaughan & nowak ( 1997 ) which corrects for the effect of poisson noise .",
    "there is a slight tendency for the coherence to fall off at higher frequencies in the soft - to - hard comparison ( lower panel of the figure ) which would be consistent with that seen in other seyfert 1 galaxies ( e.g. papadakis 2001 ; vaughan 2003a ; m@xmath13hardy 2004 ) .",
    "[ fig : lag ] shows the corresponding time lag spectra .",
    "it is clear that there are no significant time delays between the bands , even at the lower frequencies , with an upper limit of @xmath27  s at @xmath54  hz ( @xmath55  s ) , which corresponds to a @xmath8 per cent delay .",
    "unsurprisingly the cross - correlation functions ( computed using the discrete correlation function of edelson & krolik 1988 ) were reasonably symmetric and peaked at zero lag .",
    "cross - spectrum estimates .",
    "there are no clearly detected delays .",
    "[ fig : lag],width=6 ]",
    "the high frequency variability properties of  have been examined using a long ( @xmath27  ks )  observation .",
    "the variations clearly followed the linear rms - flux relation previously observed in both gbhs and other seyfert galaxies , further supporting the idea that this is a universal property of the x - ray variations from accreting black holes .",
    "the high frequency power spectrum was steep @xmath1 above a break frequency @xmath56  hz , below which it broke to a slope @xmath57 .",
    "the break frequency is the second highest recorded to date for an agn ( the record is presently held by ark 564 ; papadakis 2002 ) .",
    "the cross - spectrum between different energy bands shows the variations at frequencies @xmath58 were highly coherent and any frequency dependent time delay is constrained to be shorter than @xmath59 . in other seyferts , such as ngc  7469 ( papadakis 2001 ) ,  ( vaughan 2003a ) and ngc  4051 ( m@xmath13hardy 2004 ) , the delays are typically @xmath60 per cent .",
    "the limits of the time delays for  therefore did not rule out typical time delay characteristics . although the variations in these relatively broad - band light curves were highly coherent ,",
    "there is a strong energy - dependence to the amplitude of the variations .",

    "the power spectral break frequencies from the other ten seyferts were collected from the following papers : ark  564 ( papadakis 2002 ) ; ngc  4051 ( m@xmath13hardy 2004 ) ; ngc  3516 , ngc  3783 , ngc  4151 , ngc  5548 , fairall  9 ( markowitz 2003 ) ; mrk  766 ( vaughan & fabian 2003 ) ;  ( vaughan 2003a ) and ngc  5506 ( uttley 2002 ) .",
    "black hole mass estimates were taken from the reverberation mapping studies where possible : ark  564 ( upper limit from collier 2002 ) ; ngc  4051 ( shemmer 2003 ) ; ngc  3516 ( wandel 1999 ) ; ngc  3783 , ngc  4151 , ngc  5548 , fairall  9 ( kaspi 2000 ) .",
    "for ngc  5506 the mass was estimated using the @xmath62 relation ( section 2.3 of papadakis 2004 ) .",
    "for mrk  766 and  the mass estimates are very uncertain . based on its bulge luminosity , uttley ( 2002 )",
    "argued for @xmath63 in . due to the ambiguities in this method",
    "the error bars were taken to span an order of magnitude in each direction .",
    "for mrk  766 , wandel ( 2002 ) estimated @xmath64 based on the optical luminosity and line widths , while woo & urry ( 2002 ) estimated @xmath65 using the same reasoning . for the purpose of comparison",
    "a value of @xmath66 ( the mean of these two estimates ) was used , again assuming an order of magnitude uncertainty in either direction .",
    "also shown are the typical frequencies of the high frequency break in cyg x-1 in both the low / hard and high / soft states .    for  the break frequency @xmath67  hz",
    "was used together with a mass estimate of @xmath68 .",
    "this is the ` best guess ' of filippenko & ho ( 2003 ) consistent with the available estimates : they measured a firm upper limit on the mass of @xmath69 from stellar velocity measurements .",
    "based on photoionisation modelling of optical emission lines , kraemer ( 1999 ) derived an estimate of @xmath70 , while filippenko & ho ( 2003 ) estimated @xmath71 based on the relationship between optical luminosity and broad line region size .",
    "these are consistent with the mass estimated from the @xmath72 relation ( tremaine 2002 ) : @xmath73 .",
    "it is clear that , given the significant uncertainties in the mass estimates , there is no glaring inconsistency between the new measurement and the hypothesised @xmath74 relation .",
    "however , the details ( such as whether the index of the relation is @xmath75 and which , if any , state of cyg x-1 provides the best comparison ) remain to be investigated as more seyfert power spectra are measured .",

    "the masses are from reverberation mapping experiments except for the four objects marked using dotted error bars . also shown",
    "are typical break frequencies for cyg x-1 in both its low / hard and high / soft states .",
    "the dotted lines show example @xmath77 relations consistent with the cyg x-1 points .",
    "[ fig : m - f],width=6 ]    hayashida ( 1998 ) estimated the black hole masses for seyferts by directly comparing their x - ray power spectra with that of cyg x-1 .",
    "they measured the frequency @xmath78 at which the power spectrum reaches the level @xmath79 and compared this to the corresponding frequency in cyg x-1 . the motivation for using this frequency , instead of the break frequency ,",
    "is that the break is often harder to measure and ( in certain states at least ) is known to change frequency in cyg x-1 .",
    "there are a number of underlying assumptions to this method .",
    "the first is that both the slope and the ( relative ) normalisation of the high frequency power spectra are similar for seyferts and cyg x-1 , but the frequencies scale inversely with the black hole mass .",
    "implicit in this is the assumption that we are using comparable energy bands in the two types of source ( the power spectrum is energy dependent ) .",
    "furthermore , the original value of @xmath78 for cyg x-1 used by hayashida ( 1998 ) was taken from an observation of the source in the low / hard state .",
    "this method therefore also assumes that seyferts most closely resemble gbhs in the low / hard state , which may not be the case ( vaughan 2003a ; m@xmath13hardy 2004 ) . in the case of  the frequency @xmath78",
    "is not directly observed ; the power spectrum lies well above @xmath80 at all measured frequencies .",
    "extrapolating the best - fitting broken power law model to higher frequencies gives an estimate of @xmath81  hz ( after accounting for the factor of two difference in the normalisation used by hayashida 1998 ) .",
    "scaling from the corresponding frequency in cyg x-1 , as defined by equation 4 of hayashida ( 1998 ) gives an estimate for @xmath82 .",
    "this is comparable to the estimates made by the other methods although if , as discussed below , the normalisation of the power spectrum of is unusually high , this method will not be reliable .      the early work on the high frequency power spectra of seyfert galaxies found in favour of a universal power spectrum ( lawrence & papadakis 1993 ; green 1993 ) . more recent work ( uttley 2002 ; markowitz 2003 ) suggests that while most seyferts exhibit a similarly steep ( @xmath1 ) power spectrum at high frequencies , the slope below the break may not be universal , and some objects may show a second break ( ngc  3783 ; markowitz 2003 ) where others clearly do not ( ngc  4051 ; m@xmath13hardy 2004 ) .",
    "the extraordinary amplitude of the variations in  suggest that the normalisation of the power spectrum may also vary quite substantially from object to object .",
    "a fractional rms in excess of @xmath83 has been noted in only two other seyferts prior to  ( these are ngc  4051 , green 1999 and iras 132243809 , boller 1997 ) .",
    "ngc  4051 is also thought to contain a relatively low mass black hole ( shemmer 2003 ) . at first sight",
    "it remains possible that the high variability amplitudes in both ngc  4051 and  could be due to their power spectra being shifted to higher frequencies compared to seyferts with more massive black holes ( and , since the spectra are red , more variance is shifted into the observable frequency range ) without the need for an intrinsically higher power spectrum normalisation .",
    "the power at the break multiplied by the break frequency , @xmath84 , is indicative of the total power in the spectrum . for  this",
    "is @xmath85 in units of @xmath86 .",
    "the six seyferts studied by markowitz ( 2003 ) have values in the narrow range @xmath87 , all lower than .",
    "papadakis ( 2004 ) estimated a ` universal ' value of @xmath88 for seyfert galaxies ( called @xmath89 ) .",
    "this means that , even after accounting for the different regions of the power spectrum observed in different objects , the normalisation of the power spectrum of  is intrinsically high .    what could increase the overall amplitude of the variability ( at all frequencies ) ?",
    "a plausible suggestion is that an enhanced accretion rate ( relative to eddington ) somehow provides a more unstable accretion flow and hence stronger fluctuations .",
    "the accretion rate , relative to the eddington limit , can be estimated for  using the available black hole mass estimates , together with the bolometric luminosity .",
    "moran ( 1999 ) and lira ( 1999 ) estimate similar values of @xmath10 . assuming a mass in the range @xmath90 this gives an eddington fraction of @xmath91 per cent . however , the mean unabsorbed @xmath42  kev luminosity during the  observation was @xmath92 . assuming @xmath93 would give @xmath94 and this , less conservative , luminosity estimate gives an eddington fraction of @xmath95 per cent .",
    "if however the peak x - ray luminosity was more representative of the overall energy distribution then the luminosity could be revised upwards by a further factor of @xmath96 . ] .",
    "thus  is most likely accreting at a ` normal ' rate ; super - eddington accretion seems unlikely to be the origin of the unusually large variability amplitude .",
    "other possibilities include the black hole spin parameter , @xmath97 , and the inclination of the putative accretion disc - black hole system , @xmath98 . unfortunately , these are more difficult to test .",
