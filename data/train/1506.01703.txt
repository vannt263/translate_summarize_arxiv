    "turbulence and bulk flows provide non - thermal pressure in the hot gaseous halos of galaxies , galaxy groups , and galaxy clusters . on large scales ,",
    "this is predicted by numerical simulations ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) due to mergers and the accretion of satellites . in the centers of these systems ,",
    "turbulence and bulk flows are also introduced by active galactic nucleus ( agn ) feedback @xcite ; other mechanisms such as cosmic ray - driven instabilities @xcite and galactic stirring ( @xcite ; @xcite ) may also be important in the intracluster medium .",
    "these motions play a fundamental role in the physics of these systems .",
    "they transport energy , mass , and metals from the central nucleus into the diffuse halo , affecting the thermodynamic state of the intracluster medium and mediating the enrichment of the intergalactic medium .",
    "the non - thermal pressure from turbulence is also necessary to understand in order to estimate the masses of galaxy groups and clusters from hydrostatic equilibrium arguments .",
    "large - scale flows are expected as well around the supermassive black holes at the centers of these systems , particularly as one approaches the bondi radius @xcite . in order to understand turbulence and bulk flows in better detail ,",
    "a great deal of effort has been focused on the kinematics of the hot halo gas in galaxies , galaxy groups , and galaxy clusters , both with observations ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and simulations ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    however , these measurements are extremely challenging and expensive .",
    "constraints can be obtained in some cases through the kinetic sz effect @xcite , and observations of resonant scattering in the intracluster medium @xcite .",
    "the more direct approach is to measure the broadening and redshift of emission lines , which trace turbulence and bulk motions respectively . for bulk flows",
    ", @xcite showed that the typical motions of bulk flows in galaxy clusters are much larger than the peculiar velocities of the clusters , making such measurements possible . also , the thermal velocities of heavy ions in hot gas ( @xmath5 ) are @xmath6 times smaller than the speed of sound ( @xmath7 ) in the same gas . measuring the broadening of ( for example ) iron lines in hot plasmas ,",
    "we can detect broadening due to turbulence because even subsonic turbulence with velocities on the level of 10% of sound speed increases significantly the width of heavy ion lines @xcite . to do this",
    ", one needs to resolve the emission lines , which are primarily the soft x - ray and fe l - shell lines for gas around @xmath0 k , but ccd detectors on modern x - ray telescopes ( r @xmath8 ) lack the required spectral resolution .",
    "x - ray grating spectrographs have better resolution ( @xmath9 ) and can identify important features like the fe l shell lines , but these lines lie very close to each other and are usually blended . using a calorimeter , the hitomi satellite was recently able to make a high - precision measurement of the broadening in the fe k@xmath10 line for a single target - the perseus cluster ( fabian et al 2016 ) , which is the x - ray brightest cluster in the sky . in coming decades , such devices aboard next - generation spacecraft like athena or the x - ray surveyor will offer similar improvements in clusters hot enough to produce this line . for @xmath0 k gas , however",
    ", x - ray calorimeters will be limited to r@xmath4300 - 400 for the prominent x - ray emission lines .    here",
    "we discuss a complementary approach : measuring the kinematics of far - ultraviolet emission lines . in the fuv , the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) instrument @xcite on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) ,",
    "offers much higher throughput and spectral resolution .",
    "typically ultraviolet lines are characteristic of cooler plasma , at temperatures of @xmath11 k , but there are exceptions . some fuv lines have been used as diagnostics of plasma at temperatures around @xmath0 k , both in solar flare spectra ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and in the coronae of nearby late - type stars ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we will discuss these lines in an extragalactic context , as tracers of the intracluster medium and accretion flows .",
    "cos has one low - resolution grating ( g140l ) with @xmath12 and two medium - resolution gratings ( g130 m and g160 m ) with @xmath13 , all three of which we utilize in this work .",
    "we note that this method is conceptually similar to a method proposed by @xcite to use a 3 mm hyperfine transition from lithium - like @xmath14fe .    in figure 1",
    "we present basic diagnostic properties for six of the brightest of these lines .",
    "they are all ground - state magnetic dipole transitions of various species of highly ionized iron . in the top panel",
    ", we compare the fractional abundance of these six species of iron for plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) , based on the chianti database v. 7.15 ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in the middle panel ,",
    "we present the effective cross section for absorption from these lines , scaled to the thomson cross section ( @xmath15 @xmath16 ) . only thermal broadening is considered , and we assume an iron abundance relative to hydrogen of @xmath17 @xcite . in most extragalactic cases these lines will be optically thin , and since they are forbidden lines the optical depths will generally be very low",
    ". they may be detectable in some situations , although in this paper we focus on the lines in emission .",
    "it is important to emphasize that , since these lines are forbidden transitions and optically thin , the observed line widths are not affected by most radiative transfer effects which could otherwise introduce artificial broadening to emission lines .    in the bottom panel of figure 1",
    "we present the emissivity of these lines , defined such that @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the line luminosity and @xmath20 is the fractional abundance of iron relative to hydrogen , for which we assume the solar value measured by @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath21 is the volume emission measure , which for a pencil - beam sightline differs from the pencil - beam emission measure @xmath22 by a factor of the area @xmath23 covered by the sightline .",
    "this emissivity is also derived from the chianti database , by multiplying their g(t ) function from ` gofnt.pro ` by @xmath24 steradians .",
    "it is computed assuming collisional ionization equilibrium and that the lines are optically thin .        in figure 1 ,",
    "the brightest of these lines is [ ] @xmath11354.08 . in this paper",
    "we will focus primarily on this line , though in some cases information on this line is not available and we consider other lines .",
    "these lines trace plasma in a narrow range around @xmath0 k , with the emissivity of [ ] peaking at @xmath25 k. the instrument of choice for emission - line searches is cos , since it has the highest throughput in the fuv at present .",
    "we searched the cos archive for observations of systems known to host a significant reservoir of gas around @xmath0 k. we considered m87 , cen a , ngc 4696 , and hcg 92 ; out of these targets , m87 and ngc 4696 have already been observed by cos in the fuv .",
    "there are also observations of hcg 92 , but the the sightlines target a shock front near ngc 7318b which is likely significantly cooler than @xmath0 k. we also searched for observations of h@xmath10 filaments and/or cooling flows in galaxy clusters ; the ambient media here are hotter than @xmath0 k , but at the locations of these features multiphase gas is present , which may include @xmath0 k gas .",
    "we find suitable observations for a1795 , perseus , phoenix ( spt - cl j2344 - 4243 ) , and zw 3146 . in these latter cases",
    "we lack definite predictions of massive reservoirs of @xmath0 k gas along these sightlines , but we can use upper limits to establish independent constraints on the differential emission measure . a summary of the observations we consider is given in table 1 .    in the next several sections of this paper ,",
    "we describe the results of our search . in section 2",
    ", we present a tentative detection of [ ] and weak evidence for [ ] in the filaments projected 1.9 kpc from the center of m87 . in sections 3 and 4 we present upper limits on [ ] in the centers of m87 and ngc 4696 . in section 5",
    "we discuss potential sources of contamination , i.e. other emission lines which could be confused with [ ] and/or [ ] in these galaxies . in section 6 ,",
    "we report limits on [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] in cos observations of several additional clusters of galaxies . in section 7 , we show how the results change if the co - addition and error estimation is modified .",
    "finally , in section 8 we discuss prospects for future searches . in the appendix",
    "we discuss the filtering for geocoronal emission performed for the g140l spectra towards m87 .    [ cols= \" <",
    ", < , < , < , < \" , ]      +    assuming we are at the the peak of the emissivity for each line , the emission measure @xmath26 is the fundamental parameter and is linearly proportional to flux , so deeper observations will improve these limits proportionally to the square root of the exposure time .",
    "for many of the objects discussed in this section , such as phoenix and hcg 92 , the integration time would have to increase by factors of several in order to obtain emission measure limits as good as some of the other targets in our sample ; a better approach would be to focus on [ ] for these targets since it has a higher emissivity than the other lines .    on the other hand , the derived column density and effective path length also depend on the pressure of the hot gas ( see eqs . 1 and 2 )",
    "the latter quantity in particular depends on the inverse square of the pressure , so even weak constraints on the emission measure can translate to tight constraints on the effective path length if the ambient pressure is high ( i.e. in the cores of massive galaxy clusters ) .",
    "of course , the best target in this list is the filament region in m87 , where we have a tentative @xmath27 detection of [ ] . in the next section , we show that modest follow - up observations should readily improve these statistics and allow us to measure line kinematics .",
    "we also consider the nuclei of m87 and ngc 4696 as well .",
    "after the bulk of this analysis had been completed , the new hst spectroscopic legacy archive was released , which offers science - grade co - added spectra for galaxies and galaxy clusters observed with cos . in general these combined spectra agree well with the co - added spectra produced in this paper , which are based on the ` calcos ` pipeline .",
    "however , the hsla uses a different ( and less conservative ) method of estimating the errors , resulting in significantly smaller flux uncertainties than the errors produced by the ` calcos ` pipeline .",
    "we therefore repeated the searches for forbidden iron lines for each spectrum using these new hsla spectra , and we report the results in this section .    for the filament region in m87 , the hsla full spectrum yields a positive residual at the expected location of [ ] with @xmath28 km / s , @xmath29 km / s , and an integrated flux of @xmath30 erg s@xmath31 @xmath16 .",
    "this is generally similar to the best - fit values in section 2 , although the velocity is blueshifted by 300 km / s compared to the previous fit ; this likely reflects uncertainty in continuum fitting due to the low s / n of the spectrum .",
    "the formal significance of the detection is now @xmath32 ( compared to 2.2@xmath2 from our estimate in section 2 ) , although this should be reduced somewhat due to uncertainties in the continuum .",
    "we also estimated the line properties in the night - only spectrum using the hsla error estimate . the night - only spectrum is not provided by the hsla but we were able to reproduce their algorithm for computing the errors , which we then applied to our co - added night - only spectrum .",
    "we find @xmath33 km / s , @xmath34 km / s , and an integrated flux of @xmath35 erg s@xmath31 @xmath16 .",
    "these values are again reasonably consistent with the values from our previous analysis , albeit with higher total significance for the line ( s / n = @xmath36 for this analysis , as compared to @xmath37 in section 2 ) .    under the new error estimate ,",
    "the [ ] line in the m87 filament has @xmath38 km / s , @xmath39 km / s , and an integrated flux of @xmath40 erg s@xmath31 @xmath16 . again",
    ", these values are consistent with our previous estimates , but the s / n has increased from 0.3 to 0.8 .    for the nucleus of m87 , the feature at the expected location of [ ] now has @xmath41 km / s , @xmath42 km / s , and an integrated flux of @xmath43 erg s@xmath31 @xmath16 .",
    "these parameters are very similar to their previous best - fit values ; the uncertainties are slightly decreased but the significance of the detection remains constant at 0.7@xmath2 .    for ngc 4696 , we find for [ ] @xmath44 km / s , @xmath45 km / s , and @xmath46 erg s@xmath31 @xmath16 .",
    "this is consistent with our previous result for the line , but the s / n has actually decreased from 0.3 to 0.1 .",
    "the 90% upper limit on the flux is @xmath47 erg s@xmath31 @xmath16 , which is slightly weaker than the previous constraint .",
    "the upper limits in section 6 remain upper limits , but in general these limits are tighter using the hsla spectra . the significance of the positive residual seen towards the filament in a1795 increases from 0.7@xmath2 to 0.8@xmath2 , and the 90% upper limit on the integrated flux decreases to @xmath48 erg s@xmath31 @xmath16 . in the``horseshoe '' filament of perseus , our 90% upper limit also tightens , to @xmath49 erg s@xmath31 @xmath16 . in the phoenix cluster ,",
    "our limits on [ ] and [ ] become @xmath50 erg s@xmath31 @xmath16 and @xmath51 erg s@xmath31 @xmath16 respectively , which are moderate improvements over the values in section 6 . for zwcl 3146 ,",
    "the 90% upper limits on [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] respectively are now @xmath52 erg s@xmath31 @xmath16 , @xmath53 erg s@xmath31 @xmath16 , and @xmath54 erg s@xmath31 @xmath16 .",
    "the first two values are moderate improvements over the limits in section 6 , while the third is unchanged . finally , in hcg 92",
    ", the hslp data do not include the g130 m data , so we are unable to update the limits for this sightline using the new error method .    in general , using the new hslp method of calculating errors yields similar results to the ` calcos ` pipeline errors , but with higher inferred significances for detections and tighter constraints on non - detections .",
    "to remain conservative we report results based on the latter errors in this work , but it is straightforward to replace the values in table 2 and elsewhere with the results based on the hslp errors if desired .",
    "the required integration time depends on the width of the line , and we consider four example cases for the velocity dispersion : @xmath55 km / s ( the thermal velocity of iron ions ) , @xmath56 km / s ( 30% of the sound speed for @xmath0 k gas ) , @xmath57 km / s ( the sound speed for @xmath0 k gas ) , and @xmath2 is equal to the velocity dispersion of the stars in the galaxy ( roughly 450 km / s for m87 and roughly 250 km / s for ngc 4696 ) .",
    "this yields a fwhm for [ ] of 0.53 , 1.59 , 5.31 , and 4.78/2.66 ( for m87/ngc4696 ) respectively for the four fiducial values of @xmath2 .    using our estimated flux of @xmath58 erg s@xmath31 @xmath16 for [ ] from the filament in m87 , the times required to achieve an integrated s / n of 5 would be about 6 ks , 12 ks , 33 ks , and 30 ks respectively , or approximately 3 , 6 , 11 , and 10 orbits of integration",
    "this is comparable to the existing integration time with the g140l grating , but the medium - resolution gratings are more sensitive and the spatial broadening will be less severe with these gratings as well .    in the m87 nucleus ,",
    "our predicted flux is similar ( @xmath59 erg s@xmath31 @xmath16 for solar metallicity ; see section 3 ) .",
    "however , the high continuum in this region introduces noise as well .",
    "the continuum is about @xmath60 erg s@xmath31 @xmath16 @xmath31 , and it dominates the noise budget . in order to detect the line with an integrated s / n of 5 , for the four fiducial line widths we need s / n values of about 17 , 29 , 54 , and 48 per resel for the continuum",
    "this requires about 40 ks , 110 ks , 390 ks , and 310 ks respectively .",
    "the latter three integration times can only be obtained through a large go program .",
    "it would probably be much easier to observe a sightline a few arcseconds away from the center of m87 , where the continuum is much lower .",
    "if the line flux remained constant but there were no continuum , the required integration time would be reduced by a factor of 10 .    in the ngc 4696 nucleus ,",
    "the continuum is less of an issue , but the line flux is very low . if we use the best - fit integrated flux of @xmath61 erg s@xmath31 @xmath16 for [ ] in this sightline , then the required integration times to achieve a s / n = 5 are 50 ks , 130 ks , 410 ks , and 220 ks respectively .",
    "the velocity resolution per resel is around 15 km / s for g130 m , and this is also about the @xmath62 absolute calibration uncertainty for the instrument .",
    "however , depending on the width of the line , some binning may be necessary to get a s / n of 1 per bin if the integrated s / n is 5 .",
    "accounting for this binning , for our four fiducial velocity dispersions , we expect velocity resolution of about 20 , 30 , 60 , and 40/60 km / s respectively .",
    "if the emission is extended , then this velocity resolution will be degraded further by spatial broadening . in section 1.1",
    "we estimated this effect to be about 81 km / s for uniformly extended emission .",
    "extended emission can be identified from the 2d cross - dispersion axis versus dispersion axis image , and deconvolution can be attempted if necessary , but a limiting resolution of 81 km / s is still just 15% of the sound speed in @xmath0 k gas . a measurement of turbulent motion with @xmath480 km / s resolution would be better than any previous measurements .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that fuv spectrographs have much better sensitivity than their x - ray counterparts , which enables the study of these faint lines .",
    "for example , the reflection grating spectrometer on xmm - newton has an effective area of up to @xmath4 150 @xmath63 and the soft x - ray spectrometer on hitomi had @xmath64 @xmath63 , while cos has more than 2000 @xmath63 with the medium - resolution gratings . proposed future uv spacecraft such as the world space observatory @xcite or the public telescope will retain or improve upon the spectral resolution of cos , but these missions do lack the large collecting area of hst .",
    "finally , as we mentioned in the introduction , these lines can be observed in absorption as well .",
    "the absorption cross - sections are low , typically of order @xmath65 , but with absorption - line observations much more distant sources can be analyzed as long as they have a bright background quasar projected behind them . for [ ] , the optical depth is 1% for an electron column of @xmath66 @xmath16 ( assuming solar metallicity and a temperature of @xmath25 k ) .",
    "this can be achieved with an electron density of 0.2 @xmath67 over a path length of 10 kpc , which is obtainable in the center of some galaxy clusters , for example .",
    "in this paper we searched for [ ] @xmath11354.1 and [ ] @xmath11118.1 emission in publicly available cos fuv spectra towards m87 and ngc 4696 .",
    "these spectra are very complex and we do not attempt to model them in full , instead focusing our analysis on the region around [ ] and [ ] . towards a filament in m87 , we report a tentative ( 2.2@xmath2 ) detection of [ ] with an integrated flux of @xmath68 erg s@xmath31 @xmath16 .",
    "this line is located very close to a nearby airglow line , and while this airglow line seems to be negligible in these observations , we also report a 90% upper limit based only on the data taken during orbital night .",
    "we also report 90% upper limits on [ ] towards the nuclei of m87 and ngc 4696 , with values of @xmath69 erg s@xmath31 @xmath16 , and @xmath70 erg s@xmath31 @xmath16 respectively , corresponding to limits on the line luminosities of @xmath71 erg s@xmath31 , and @xmath72 erg s@xmath31 .",
    "we perform emission measure analysis on each pencil - beam column as well , inferring constraints on the electron column and the characteristic path length of the hot gas , assuming a temperature of @xmath25 k ( the temperature at which [ ] emissivity peaks ) . for the filament sightline",
    ", we infer a hot gas electron column of @xmath73 @xmath16 and an effective column length of @xmath74 kpc . for the nuclei of m87 and ngc 4696 , our respective 90% upper limits on the column density are @xmath75 @xmath16 and @xmath76 @xmath16 and our respective 90% upper limits on the effective path length are 8.2 kpc and 14.1 kpc .    in both the filament sightline and the nuclear sightline we are able to compare our constraints to x - ray measurements of the emission measure of 1 kev gas by @xcite and @xcite . in both cases our uv constraints are fully consistent with the x - ray measurements .",
    "we also examine several other sightlines towards galaxy clusters .",
    "these additional sightlines probe multiphase media , but there are not clear predictions of massive reservoirs of @xmath0 k gas along these sightlines",
    ". we do not detect any of these fuv lines in these spectra , although some of our upper limits are competitive with the m87 and ngc 4696 spectra , or with existing x - ray measurements .",
    "our limits can be used to constrain the differential emission measure of the multiphase plasma in some cases .",
    "follow - up cos observations of moderate duration should be able to improve the situation dramatically , as we showed in section 8 .",
    "in particular , it is especially important to obtain medium - resolution spectra of the m87 filament , in order to confirm the weak [ ] feature we identified and to measure the shape of the line .    with future instrumentation",
    ", observations targeting [ ] will be able to expand to additional sightlines .",
    "multiple sightlines for a single object could be extremely valuable for mapping out the velocity structure of the intracluster and intragroup media , as well as quantifying the density fluctuations ( @xcite , @xcite ) . additionally , constraining the other fuv lines in figure 1 along with [ ] would yield precise constraints on the distribution of temperatures in the hot gaseous halo .",
    "the authors would like to thank charles danforth and john stocke for very helpful discussions and for assistance with reducing and co - adding cos data and the anonymous referee for thoughtful reports which helped to improve this work . based on observations made with the nasa / esa hubble space telescope , and obtained from the hubble legacy archive , which is a collaboration between the space telescope science institute ( stsci / nasa ) , the space telescope european coordinating facility ( st - ecf / esa ) and the canadian astronomy data centre ( cadc / nrc / csa ) .",

    "in this section we discuss the geocoronal 1356 doublet , and the efforts which were undertaken to rule out emission from this doublet in our g140l observation . at the redshift of m87 , [ ]",
    "has an expected wavelength of 1359.9 , which is just a few resels away from geocoronal @xmath11358.51 .",
    "this is the weaker of the two lines in the @xmath11356 doublet ; the stronger line has @xmath77  .",
    "@xmath11356 dayglow emission is powered by collisional excitation from photoelectrons , while the nightglow is dominated by radiative recombination ; the time - averaged dayglow emission looking towards nadir at 600 km ( similar the orbital elevation of hst , which is around 550 km ) is more than an order of magnitude brighter than the nightglow @xcite .",
    "we use the ` timefilter ` routine provided in costools v. 1.0.6 to filter the data , keying on the altitude of the sun in order to remove the data taken during local daytime ( ` sun_alt ` @xmath78 ) , which eliminates the dayglow emission .    in order to be confident that we have accounted for all the geocoronal @xmath79",
    ", we briefly discuss the nature of the @xmath79 nightglow emission .",
    "most of the @xmath79 nightglow is produced at lower altitudes than the orbit of hst , and so the emission from this doublet looking towards zenith is generally negligible @xcite ) .",
    "as the altitude increases , the zenith - looking ratio of @xmath79 to @xmath80 gets lower and lower , since the latter have oscillator strengths which are orders of magnitude higher than the former .",
    "some @xmath80 emission produced below the orbit of hst can therefore scatter into the line of sight , while most nightglow @xmath79 emission does not reach the detector ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this explains the relative nightglow line strengths listed in the cycle 23 cos instrument handbook ( table 7.4 ) , in which @xmath80 is an order of magnitude brighter than @xmath79 at orbital night .    in figure 2 ,",
    "the @xmath80 triplet has nearly disappeared , due to the removal of the dayglow emission .",
    "the emission from the @xmath79 should be even weaker than the tiny residual at 1304 , probably by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "consequently , we can feel confident that the spectrum in figure 2 is essentially clean of any measurable @xmath79 geocoronal emission .",
    "the analysis of dataset lc7t02010 was more complicated , so we do not include results from this observation in the merged spectrum in figure 2 .",
    "three of the ten observations within this dataset ( lc7t02h0q , lc7t02hiq , and lc7t02hmq ) show anomalously high @xmath11354 airglow emission , which remains strong during orbital night even while 1304 decreases .",
    "this behavior has been observed by other missions as well ( e.g. @xcite ) during periods of high geomagnetic activity .",
    "we tested the effect of combining the other seven observations in dataset lc7t02010 with the observations in figure 2 , but the restriction to orbital night removes most of the data , so that only 883 seconds of integration time remain to be added to the existing 7858 s of night - only data .",
    "the results are therefore nearly identical to those shown in figure 2 ."
