    "-10pt      the supermassive black hole paradigm for agns was launched by zeldovich ( 1964 ) , salpeter ( 1964 ) , and lynden - bell ( 1969 , 1978 ) , who argued that the high energy production efficiencies required to make quasars are provided by gravity power .",
    "eddington - limited accretion suggested that bh engines have masses of @xmath2 to @xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "confidence grew rapidly with the amazing progress in agn observations and with the paradigm s success in weaving these results into a coherent theoretical picture . unlike the normal course of scientific research , acceptance of the agn paradigm came long before there was any dynamical evidence that bhs exist .",
    "the stellar - dynamical bh search began with two papers on m87 by young ( 1978 ) and by sargent ( 1978 ) .",
    "based on the non - isothermal ( cuspy ) surface brightness profile of its core and an observed rise in velocity dispersion toward the center , they showed that m87 contains an @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath4 mdo if the stellar velocity distribution is isotropic . at about the same time , it became clear that almost no giant ellipticals like m87 are isotropic ( e.g. , illingworth 1977 ; binney 1978 ) and that anisotropic models can explain the cuspy core and the dispersion gradient without a bh ( duncan & wheeler 1980 ; binney & mamon 1982 ; richstone & tremaine 1985 ; dressler & richstone 1990 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the young and sargent papers were seminal .",
    "they set the field in motion .",
    "the dynamical detection of dark objects in galaxy centers began with the discovery of an @xmath7 @xmath4  mass  in  m32 ( tonry 1984 , 1987 ; dressler & richstone 1988 ) , a @xmath8 @xmath4 object in m31 ( dressler & richstone 1988 ; kormendy 1988a ) , and @xmath9 @xmath4 objects in ngc 4594 ( kormendy 1988b ) and ngc 3115 ( kormendy & richstone 1992 ) .",
    "the observations were ground - based with resolution fwhm @xmath101@xmath11 .",
    "the bh case in our galaxy developed slowly ( see genzel , hollenbach , & townes 1994 ; kormendy & richstone 1995 for reviews ) , for two reasons . dust extinction made it necessary to use infrared techniques that were just being developed in the early 1990s .",
    "and the @xmath5 measurement in our galaxy requires the study of a relatively small number of stars that are bright enough to be observed individually . as",
    "a result , graininess in the light and velocity distributions becomes a problem . on the other hand ,",
    "the galactic center is very close , so progress in the past decade has been spectacular . now",
    "the galaxy is by far the best supermassive bh case (  1.3.2 ) .",
    "the bh search speeded up dramatically once _ hst _ provided spatial resolution a factor of 3 to 10 better than ground - based telescopes ( see kormendy & gebhardt 2001 for a review ) . by",
    "now , almost all galaxies in which bhs were discovered from the ground have undergone several iterations of improved spatial resolution .",
    "analysis machinery has improved just as dramatically .",
    "this is an opportune time to take stock of the past 15 years of progress .",
    "are the detections of central dark objects reliable ?",
    "are the derived masses robust ? and are the dark objects really bhs ? the bh search is starting to look like a solved problem ; assuming this , emphasis has shifted to demographic studies of bhs and their relation to galaxy evolution ( see richstone et al .  1998 ; ho 1999 ; kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ; richstone 2003 for reviews ) .",
    "is this a reasonable attitude ?",
    "sanity checks are the purpose of this paper .",
    "the history of supermassive bh mass measurements is summarized in table 1.1 . in focusing on this history ,",
    "i will be concerned with whether we achieve approximately the accuracies that we believe .",
    "that is , i concentrate on errors of 0.2 dex .",
    "to what extent hard work can further squeeze the measurement errors is discussed by gebhardt ( 2003 ) .    in table 1.1 , horizontal lines separate bh detections based on stellar dynamics ( first group ) , ionized gas dynamics ( middle ) , and maser dynamics ( last group ) .",

    "m81 has been observed independently in stars and ionized gas ; both measurements are listed and they agree .",
    "however , consistency checks of @xmath5 values based on ionized gas dynamics have revealed some problems in other galaxies ; these are discussed by maciejewski & binney ( 2001 ) , barth et al .",

    "i have not included all multiple measurements based on ionized gas dynamics .",
    "m32 was the first application of many improvements in spatial resolution , in kinematic analysis techniques , and in dynamical modeling machinery .",
    "it provides an excellent case study for a review of these developments .",
    "figure 1.1 illustrates the remarkable result that bh mass estimates for m32 have remained stable for more than 15 years while a variety of competing groups have improved the observations and analysis estimates increase with improving spatial resolution because we reach farther into the bh sphere of influence and ( 2 ) that @xmath5 estimates decrease as dynamical models get more sophisticated because the models have more freedom to tinker the orbital structure to fit the data without a bh .",
    "i disagree .",
    "( 1 ) reaching farther into the bh sphere of influence should not change @xmath5 if we model the stellar dynamics adequately well .",
    "instead , we should get more `` leverage '' and smaller mass error bars . of course , if we model the physics incorrectly , then more leverage may result in a systematic change in @xmath5 .",
    "but the change could go either way , depending on how the models err in approximating the true velocity anisotropy .",
    "in fact , figure 1.4 shows that improving the spatial resolution does not increase the @xmath5 values given by the gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2003 ) three - integral models , although it does , as expected , improve the error bars . for the magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) models , improving the resolution decreases @xmath5 , an effect opposite to that predicted by the referee . ( 2 ) improving modeling techniques provides more degrees of freedom on the orbital structure , but modeling programs do not have any built - in desire to decrease the bh mass . instead , they have instructions to fit the data . again ,",
    "if the real orbital structure is sufficiently well approximated by simple models , then making the models more complicated will not change the bh mass . and",
    "if the orbital structure is not well approximated by the simple models , then better models could just as easily increase @xmath5 as decrease it .",
    "however , the low - mass error bar on @xmath5 will decrease , for the reason the referee suggests .",
    "the high - mass error bar will increase . as a result , the error bars become larger and more realistic .",
    "this effect is evident in table 1.1 .",
    "i conclude that the consistency of @xmath5 estimates in figures 1.1 and 1.2 tells us something important , namely that we have been modeling the stellar dynamics of power - law galaxies well enough to derive robust bh masses . ] .",
    "the bh in m32 was discovered as early as possible , when the spatial resolution was so poor that @xmath12 @xmath13 1 .",
    "this is not surprising , given the importance of the  problem . in astronomy as in other sciences , if you wait for a 5@xmath14 result , someone else is likely to make the discovery when it is still a 2@xmath14 result .",
    "the trick is to be careful enough to get the right answer even when the result is uncertain .",
    "tonry ( 1984 , 1987 ) got within a factor of 2.5 of the current best bh mass even though he made serious simplifying  assumptions .",
    "his spectra did not resolve the intrinsic velocity dispersion gradient near the center ; rotational line broadening accounted for the apparent dispersion gradient . without an intrinsic dispersion gradient ,",
    "his models were guaranteed not to be self - consistent , because there was no dynamical support in the axial direction . despite this approximation , tonry derived @xmath15 @xmath4 , close to the modern value .",
    "poor spatial resolution allowed considerable freedom to interpret dispersion gradients as unresolved rotation ; since @xmath16 and @xmath14 contribute comparably to the dynamical support , trading one for the other results in no large change in @xmath5 .",
    "the spatial resolution of the spectroscopy improved by a factor of 30 from the discovery observations ( tonry 1984 ) to the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) data from _ hst_. in column 6 of table  1.1 , the gaussian dispersion radius of the psf is estimated as follows .",
    "first , i estimate the resolution in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the slit as @xmath17 , the sum in quadrature of the radius @xmath18 of the telescope psf and of 1/2 pixel , and @xmath19 , the sum in quadrature of the radius of the telescope psf and half of the slit width .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "psf was modeled in van der marel , de zeeuw , & rix ( 1997b ) as the sum of three gaussians ; for all _ hst _ observations , i use @xmath20 , the best single gaussian dispersion radius that fits this sum . finally , the effective @xmath21 is the geometric mean of @xmath17 and @xmath19 .",
    "i do not take into account slit centering errors ; for some observations , these are larger than @xmath21 .",
    "dressler & richstone ( 1988 ) and richstone , bower , & dressler ( 1990 ) followed with better observations and analysis .",
    "they fitted spherical maximum entropy models including velocity anisotropy . by this time",
    ", it was well known that unknown velocity dispersion anisotropy was the biggest uncertainty in @xmath5 measurements based on stellar dynamics .",
    "they were unable to explain the central kinematic gradients in m32 without a bh .",
    "rapid confirmation of tonry s bh detection contributed to the early acceptance of this subject .",
    "since then , dynamical modeling machinery has improved remarkably .",
    "the next major step defined the state of the art from 1995 through 1997 .",
    "this was the use of two - integral models that included flattening and velocity dispersion anisotropy .",
    "essentially simultaneous work by van der marel et al .",
    "( 1994b ) , qian et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and dehnen ( 1995 ) all derived @xmath22 @xmath4 from van der marel s data . soon thereafter , bender , kormendy , & dehnen ( 1996 ) got @xmath23 @xmath4 using the same machinery on cfht data of resolution .",
    "the limitation of these models , as the authors realized , was the fact that two - integral models are approximations .",
    "they work best for cuspy and relatively rapidly rotating galaxies like m32 , but they are not fully general . still , by this time , it was routine to measure not just the first two moments of the line - of - sight velocity distributions ( losvds )  that is , @xmath16 and @xmath14  but also the next two coefficients @xmath24 and @xmath25 in a gauss - hermite expansion of the losvds .",
    "these measure asymmetric and symmetric departures from gaussian line profiles . in a transparent galaxy that rotates differentially",
    ", projection guarantees that @xmath26 . in general , @xmath24 is antisymmetric with @xmath16 .",
    "a galaxy containing a bh is likely to have @xmath27 ; that is , an losvd that is more centrally peaked than a gaussian .",
    "the reason is that stars close to the bh move very rapidly and give the losvd broader symmetric wings than they would otherwise have ( van der marel 1994 ) .",
    "thus , as emphasized especially by van der marel et al .",
    "( 1994a ) , measuring and fitting @xmath24 and @xmath25 adds important new constraints both to the stellar distribution function and to the bh detection and mass determination .    _",
    "hst _ faint object spectrograph ( fos ) observations of m32 were obtained by van der marel et al .",
    "( 1998b ) .",
    "these authors further `` raised the bar '' on bh mass measurements by fitting their data with three - integral dynamical models constructed using schwarzschild s ( 1979 ) method .",
    "such models now define the state of the art ( see cretton et al .  1999b ; gebhardt et al .  2000a , 2003 ;",
    "richstone et al .",
    "2003 for more detail ) .    finally , the most thorough data set and modeling analysis for m32 is provided by verolme et al .  ( 2002 ) .",
    "they use the sauron two - dimensional spectrograph to measure @xmath16 , @xmath14 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 in the central 9@xmath11 @xmath28 11@xmath11 . also , _ hst _",
    "stis spectroscopy ( joseph et al .",
    "2001 ) provides improved data near the bh .",
    "these observations fitted with three - integral models for the first time break the near - degeneracy between the stellar mass - to - light ratio , @xmath29 , and the unknown inclination of the galaxy . because the mass in stars is better known , the bh mass is more reliable .",
    "again , the derived bh mass is similar to that given in previous analyses , @xmath30 @xmath4 .",
    "so the bh mass derived for m32 has remained almost unchanged while the and analysis have improved dramatically .",
    "it was exceedingly important to our confidence in the bh detection to test whether the apparent kinematic gradients near the center could be explained without a bh .",
    "asked to do this , a dynamical modeling code attempts to fine - tune the stellar velocity dispersion anisotropy .",
    "in general , it tries to add more radial orbits near the center , because doing so implies less mass for the same @xmath14 .",
    "nowadays , its freedom to tinker is severely restricted by the need to match the full losvds .",
    "however , even simple approximations to the dynamical structure gave essentially the correct bh mass .",
    "_ that is , m32 does not use its freedom to indulge in perverse orbit structure .",
    "_ the following sections show that this is also true in our galaxy , m31 , ngc 3117 , ngc 3377 , and ngc 4594 .",
    "dynamical mass modeling is relatively benign in such galaxies that have power - law profiles ( for more details , see kormendy et al .",
    "1994 ; lauer et al .  1995 ; gebhardt et al .  1996 ; faber et al .",
    "1997 ; lauer 2003 ) .",
    "it would not be safe to assume that this result applies equally well to galaxies with cuspy cores .",
    "figure 1.2 summarizes the history of bh mass measurements in galaxies with observations or stellar - dynamical mass analyses by different research groups .",
    "the bh case that has improved the most is the one in our galaxy .",
    "both the evidence for a central dark object and the arguments that this is a bh and not something less exotic like a cluster of dark stars are better in our galaxy than anywhere else .",
    "a complete review of the bh search in our galaxy is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "early work is discussed in genzel & townes ( 1987 ) ; genzel et al .",
    "( 1994 ) ; kormendy & richstone ( 1995 ) , and in conference proceedings such as backer ( 1987 ) , morris ( 1989 ) , and genzel & harris ( 1994 ) . observations of our galactic center benefit from the fact that it is 100 times closer than the next nearest good bh cases , m31 and m32 . for a distance of 8 kpc ,",
    "the scale is 258 pc@xmath31 .",
    "early gas- and stellar - dynamical studies suggested the presence of a several - million - solar - mass dark object . in table 1.1 and",
    "figure 1.2 , i date the convincing case for a bh to sellgren et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and to kent ( 1992 ) . since then , two dramatic improvements in spatial resolution have taken place .",
    "research groups led by reinhard genzel and andrea ghez have pioneered the use of speckle interferometry and , more recently , adaptive optics imaging and spectroscopy to achieve spatial resolutions good enough to resolve a tiny cluster of stars ( radius @xmath32 ) that surrounds the compact radio source sgr a * at the galactic center . the sgr",
    "a * cluster is so tiny that stars move fast enough to allow us to observe proper motions .",
    "this provides a direct measure of the velocity dispersion anisotropy .",
    "it is not large .",
    "the derived central mass is about @xmath33 @xmath4 . and ,",
    "even though the number density of stars is higher than we observe anywhere else , the volume is so small that the stellar mass is negligible .",
    "the advent of proper motion measurements accounts for the jump in @xmath12 at the start of 1997 .",
    "a second jump in @xmath12 has just occurred as a result of an even more remarkable observational coup . as reviewed in this volume by ghez ( 2003 ) , schdel et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , ghez ( 2003 ) , and ghez et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have independently measured several individual stellar orbits through pericenter passage . in the case of star s2 ,",
    "more than half of an orbit has been observed ( period = 15.78 @xmath34 0.82 years ) .",
    "the orbit is closed , so the controlling mass resides inside @xmath35 pc @xmath36 127 au @xmath36 1790 schwarzschild radii .",
    "this accounts for the current jump in spatial resolution .",
    "as measurement accuracies improve , the observation of individual closed orbits will rapidly obsolete the complicated analysis of stellar distribution functions that describe ensembles of stars at larger radii . rather",
    ", the analysis will acquire the much greater rigor inherent in the two - body problem .",
    "arguably the orbit of s2 already contributes as much to our confidence in the bh detection as all stars at larger radii combined .",
    "the best - fitting bh mass , @xmath37 @xmath4 , is in good agreement with , but slightly larger than , the value derived from the stellar - dynamical modeling .",
    "this leads to an important point : the above comparison in our galaxy and a similar one in ngc 4258 ( see the next section ) are currently the only reliable external checks on our stellar - dynamical modeling machinery .",
    "the measurement accuracies are not good enough yet to show whether the models achieve the accuracies that we expect for the best data ( @xmath3430% : gebhardt 2003 ) . but",
    "neither test points to modeling errors that range over a factor of @xmath38 as feared by valluri , merritt , & emsellem ( 2003 ) .",
    "finally , these new observations have an implication that is actually more fundamental than the mass measurement .",
    "they restrict the dark mass to live inside such a small radius that even neutrino balls ( tsiklauri & viollier 1998 , 1999 ; munyaneza , tsiklauri , & viollier 1998 , 1999 ; munyaneza & viollier 2002 ) with astrophysically allowable neutrino masses are excluded .",
    "the exclusion principle forces them to be too fluffy to be consistent with the radius constraints .",
    "dark clusters of brown dwarf stars or stellar remnants were already excluded ( maoz 1995 , 1998 )  brown dwarfs would collide , merge , and become visible stars , and stellar remnants would evaporate via relaxation processes .",

    "it is just the sort of high - density concentration of stars that we always expected to find around a bh . from a practical point of view",

    "( 4 ) the virial theorem applied to the blue cluster gives @xmath89 @xmath4 .",

    "an improved eccentric disk model has just become available ; it gives @xmath90 @xmath4 ( peiris & tremaine 2003 ) . the most accurate bh mass is likely to come from such detailed analysis of the asymmetric nucleus .",
    "here , i adopt a bh mass in the middle of the above range ; it should be accurate to a factor of @xmath0 .",
    "we can now ask : can we stuff @xmath91 @xmath4 of brown dwarfs or stellar remnants into the central 006 without getting into trouble ?",
    "the answer is `` no '' ( kormendy et al .",
    "2003b ) .  following maoz ( 1995 , 1998 ) ,",
    "brown dwarfs are strongly excluded .",
    "the collision time for even the most massive brown dwarf ( which becomes a luminous star after only one merger ) is less than @xmath3 yr . less massive brown dwarfs collide more quickly .",
    "dark clusters made of stellar - mass bhs or neutron stars evaporate in several billion years and are at least weakly excluded .",
    "the most viable dark cluster would be made of 0.6 @xmath4 white dwarfs .",
    "such a cluster would have an evaporation time of @xmath92 yr and is not excluded by the arguments made so far .",
    "however , we can add a new argument .",
    "an mdo made of stellar remnants is viable only if its progenitor stars can safely live their lives and deliver their remnants at suitable radii .",
    "progenitors get into more trouble than their remnants .",
    "they are so close together that they collide too quickly , as follows",
    ". the progenitor cluster must be as small as the dark cluster , because dynamical friction is too slow to deliver remnants from much larger radii .",
    "we get into less trouble with collisions if fewer progenitors are resident at one time .",
    "that is , if the dark cluster was made in time @xmath93 , and if the progenitor star lifetime is @xmath94 , the safest strategy is to have @xmath95 successive generations , each with an equal number of progenitors . for @xmath96  yr",
    ", we then calculate the time scale on which any one progenitor star collides with another as a function of the stellar mass and generation number .",
    "the longest time scales are @xmath91 yr for black hole and neutron star progenitors and shorter for the more troublesome white dwarf progenitors .",
    "colliding stars merge and become progenitors of higher - mass remnants .",
    "also , stellar mergers decrease the number of stars and increase the mass range and so shorten the dynamical evolution time .",
    "the result is a dark cluster with a short evaporation time .",
    "so astrophysically plausible alternatives to a supermassive bh are likely to fail .",
    "our leverage on the m31 bh , @xmath97 , is almost as good as @xmath98 for ngc 4258 .",
    "astrophysical arguments against bh alternatives are stronger in the latter case because we know in ngc 4258 but not in m31 that the rotation curve is accurately keplerian at @xmath1 @xmath21 .",
    "this leads to a factor - of - ten stronger constraint on the half - mass radius of the dark object in ngc 4258 ( maoz 1995 , 1998 ) .",
    "nevertheless , m31 becomes the third galaxy in which astrophysical arguments favor the conclusion that a dynamically detected dark object is a bh .",
    "this increases our confidence that all of them are bhs .",
    "finally , a great variety of agn observations , including relativistic jets and x - ray fe k@xmath99 line widths as large as 1/3 of the speed of light , argue forcefully that the engines for nuclear activity in galaxies are bhs .",
    "the sanity checks that were the purpose of this paper have succeeded .",
    "progress on a broad front is on the agenda for this meeting .",
    "it is gratifying to see the developing connection between the dynamical bh search and the agn work that motivated it .",
    "the limited contact between these subjects was a complaint in kormendy & richstone ( 1995 ) .",
    "now , reverberation mapping ( blandford & mckee 1982 ; netzer & peterson 1997 ) has become a reliable tool to measure bh masses ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000c ; barth 2003 ) .",
    "ionization models of agns ( netzer 1990 ; rokaki , boisson , & collin - souffrin 1992 ) are consistent with other techniques ( mclure & dunlop 2001 ; wandel 2002 ; shields et al .",
    "2003 ) . the growing connection between bh dynamical searches , agn physics , and the study of galaxy formation is a sign of the developing maturity of this subject ( e.g. , kormendy 2000 ) .",
    "the emphasis on bh discovery has given way to the richer field of bh astrophysics .",
    "kormendy & richstone ( 1995 ) was entitled `` inward bound :  the search for supermassive black holes in galaxy nuclei '' because the bh search is an iterative process .",
    "`` we make incremental improvements in spatial resolution , each expensive in ingenuity and money .",
    "[ the above ] paper reviews the first order of magnitude of the inward journey in radius . '' at that time , the best bh candidate , ngc 4258 , was observed with a resolution @xmath100 schwarzschild radii ( miyoshi et al .",
    "now @xmath101 schwarzschild radii for m31 and for ngc 3115 . the best bh case",
    ", our own galaxy , has @xmath102 schwarzschild radii .",
    "the gap between the smallest radii reached by dynamical studies and the radii studied by the well - developed industry on accretion disk physics is shrinking .",
    "this , too , is a sign of the growing maturity of the subject .",
    "`` the universe [ may be ] too frighteningly queer to be understood by minds like ours .",
    "it s not a popular view .",

    "however reassured we may be by the tests reviewed here , it is worth remembering that even star s2 in the galaxy s sgr a * cluster , which approaches to within 1790 schwarzschild radii of the central engine , lives well outside the region of strong gravity .",

    "<S> the robustness of stellar - dynamical black hole ( bh ) mass measurements is using six galaxies that have results from independent research groups . </S>",
    "<S> derived bh masses have remained constant to a factor of @xmath0 as spatial resolution has improved by a factor of as velocity distributions have been measured in increasing detail , and as the analysis has improved from spherical , isotropic models to axisymmetric , three - integral models . </S>",
    "<S> this gives us confidence that the masses are reliable and that the galaxies do not indulge in a wide variety of perverse orbital structures . </S>",
    "<S> another successful test is the agreement between a preliminary stellar - dynamical bh mass for ngc 4258 and the accurate mass provided by the maser disk . </S>",
    "<S> constraints on bh alternatives are also improving . in m31 , _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) spectroscopy shows that the central massive dark object ( mdo ) is in a tiny cluster of blue stars embedded in the p2 nucleus of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the mdo must have a radius @xmath1 006 . </S>",
    "<S> m31 becomes the third galaxy in which dark clusters of brown dwarf stars or stellar remnants can be excluded . in our galaxy , </S>",
    "<S> spectacular proper motion observations of almost - complete stellar orbits show that the central dark object has radius @xmath1 0.0006 pc . among bh alternatives , this excludes even neutrino balls . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , measurements of central dark masses and the conclusion that these are bhs have both stood the test of time . </S>",
    "<S> confidence in the bh paradigm for active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is correspondingly high .    </S>",
    "<S> compared to the radius of the bh sphere of influence , bhs are being discovered at similar spatial resolution with _ </S>",
    "<S> hst _ as in ground - based work . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that _ hst _ is used to observe more distant galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> typical bhs are detectable in the virgo cluster , and the most massive ones are detectable 3  6 times farther away . large , unbiased samples are accessible . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> _ hst _ has revolutionized the study of bh demographics .    </S>",
