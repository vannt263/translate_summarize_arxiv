    "the mutual dependence of proteins and nucleic acids in their replication leads to a catch-22 in the origin of life : the first organism would require enzymes to replicate its genome , but these enzymes can not be synthesized without the nucleic acids that code for them .",
    "@xcite this paradox was first resolved with thomas cech s discovery of self - splicing rna in the protozoan _ tetrahymena thermophila_.",
    "@xcite the existence of such a `` ribozyme '' that can both carry genetic information and perform catalysis removes the necessity of an event during which proteins and nucleic acids spontaneously emerged .",
    "thus , the idea that an rna world preceded the modern dna - rna world , once speculation by crick and his colleagues , @xcite had reached the mainstream as the `` rna world hypothesis . '' @xcite    according to cech , an rna world transitioned to a ribonucleoprotein ( rnp ) world of protein - bound nucleotides which were favorable for their greater versatility in catalysis .",
    "a final transition led to the current dna - rna world along with the last universal common ancestor ( luca ) to take advantage of dna s greater resistance to hydrolysis .",
    "@xcite the remaining problem is the origin of the ribozymes themselves . by the early 1990s , leading molecular biologists rejected `` the myth of a self - replicating rna molecule that arose _ de novo _ from a soup of random polynucleotides . ''",

    "the premise here , as it was there , is that information stored in an rna sequence is lost upon hydrolytic cleavage so somehow a lasting memory must have emerged , likely in the form of a replicator .",
    "it is imprudent to be overly concerned with the numerical details due to our ignorance of the chemical and thermal factors of ancient oceans .",

    "the limit is taken as the molecule s size approaches zero and the temperature gradient becomes approximately uniform throughout the region .",
    "@xmath31 the force field due to thermophoresis is therefore conservative .",
    "this is equivalent to archimedes law with pressure replaced by the most probable ( mode ) ratio of thermal energy to volume .",

    "in the previous section it was shown that particles in a hydrothermal vent system experience temperature oscillations . here",
    "it is proposed that these oscillations could mirror the thermal cycling that is the fundamental basis of the polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) .",
    "a `` quasi - polymerase chain reaction '' ( quasi - pcr ) would consist of two primary stages : denaturation and rehybridization .",
    "the former stage takes place most favorably near the vent so that the hydrogen bonds united the complementary rna strands may be destroyed .",
    "the latter stage must take place far from the vent at the ambient ocean temperature so that loci that have undergone rehybridization  a slow process when uncatalyzed  are not prematurely broken by rogue thermal fluctuations .",
    "it is essential to provide long spans of time at this low temperature .",
    "the oscillations shown in figure 1 are merely to illustrate their existence and are too wide and too frequent to result from a hydrothermal vent that creates a temperature gradient potentially larger than 400@xmath39c .",
    "@xcite hybridized molecules will actually stay at cooler temperatures longer than this model predicts by virtue of their size : the diffusion coefficient is inversely proportional to the particle s mass ( also by the stokes - einstein equation ( * ? ? ?",

    "this suggests that the mechanism presented thus far can provide a more general framework for rapid polymerization in hydrothermal vent systems , irrespective of the detailed chemistry . on an even more fundamental level , this reaction is analogous to the classic urey - miller experiment @xcite as they both involve systematically shocking small molecular components in hopes that several will exceed some high activation energy to ultimately yield a more ordered product .",

    "a fundamental difference between true pcr as it is used in the laboratory and quasi - pcr is the nature of the thermal cycling : while the former is carried out in very discrete stages of denaturation , annealing , and elongation , the latter involves the periodic and continuous temperature oscillations shown in figure 1 .",

    "this is equivalent to extremizing the functional @xmath169 which is a variational problem .",
    "@xmath93 is given in .",
    "the degradation rate @xmath102 will be the function subject to optimization since it can be explicitly expressed in terms of the temperature ( see 5.4 ) .",
    "the hybridization rate @xmath101 will be treated as a constant since we are now operating under the conditions of enzyme - catalyzed modern pcr .",

    "the author is currently working to approximate an analytic solution to while preserving its critical features . until then",
    ", preliminary monte carlo simulations for several temperature functions can be presented .",
    "figure 6 depicts the average factor by which the number of molecules has been amplified for constant , square - wave , and quasi - pcr temperature functions .",
    "note that simulations were only carried out for polynucleotides of length five and the results are expected to become even more dramatic for longer chains .",
    "the initial drop is due to the initial single molecule consistently undergoing denaturation among all the trials .",
    "it is the recovery from this depletion that occurs at differential rates among the paradigms .",
    "( blue ) , square wave temperature oscillations ( purple ) , and quasi - pcr oscillations ( gold ) .",
    "averages are taken over 50 trials beginning from a single molecule .",
    "the latter method appears best , but analysis is by no means complete as there is no obvious way to put the paradigms on equal footing for a comparison when they are so fundamentally different . ]",
    "it is a concern that the optimal temperature function according to may not be characteristic of a chain reaction  that is , it may not be periodic . a method is developed here to force periodicity when extremizing functionals that depend on the function and first time derivative .",
    "let the functional operating on temperature @xmath142 be @xmath171 . for simplicity and",
    "since it is reasonable to start the chain reaction at the peak temperature , we will assume @xmath142 is an even function with angular frequency @xmath37 . using a fourier cosine series we can rewrite the functional as @xmath172 now this is an optimization of a countably infinite number of variables so we can resort to methods of traditional rather than variational calculus . in other words , all the derivatives of @xmath173 with respect to the coefficients",
    "must identically vanish when the coefficients are optimal . using the multivariable chain rule , when @xmath174 , @xmath175 after rearrangement , the implicit function theorem allows the ratio of the partial derivatives to be reduced .",
    "@xmath176 where the subscript means @xmath173 is being held constant as @xmath142 and its derivative are allowed to vary .",
    "note the minus sign that is not a typo but is required by the implicit function theorem .",
    "computation is likely easier using the less attractive @xmath177 .",
    "the optimization was done for the symbol temperature but of course it would generalize to @xmath102 when applied to .      in a scenario more general than pcr ,",
    "consider two processes @xmath178 and @xmath179 which occur in turn with respective temperature - dependent rates of @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "let @xmath182 and @xmath183 be , respectively , the initial state and the state after process @xmath178 has occurred but before @xmath179 .",
    "@xmath179 then is the transition from @xmath183 to @xmath184 , making the reaction cyclic .",
    "letting @xmath185 be the probability vector over the system s states , the evolution has a simple master equation .",
    "@xmath186 given that all components begin in @xmath182 and that @xmath187 $ ] as described in subsection 4.2 , the first - order linear system yields @xmath188 where the explicit temperature dependence of @xmath189 and @xmath190 are omitted .",
    "again , the functional to be maximized is the integral of @xmath43 from 0 to a constant so as to extremize .      here",
    "the independent converse argument mentioned in this section s introduction will be briefly described .",
    "the biomimicry proposal was premised upon the validity of the quasi - pcr hypothesis .",
    "though evidence can be gathered for quasi - pcr , one can of course never be certain of what actually occurred in prebiotic times",
    ". therefore one can never be certain whether nonlinear pcr is _ actually _ mimicking anything that ever occurred in biology .",
    "what one _ can _ plausibly be certain of is that our current biochemistry is such that it replicates very effectively when subjected to the thermal conditions of subsection 2.3 .",
    "this then would serve as evidence that quasi - pcr was responsible for the emergence of lasting genetic memory .",
    "figure 7 shows the relationship between these two arguments and highlights some of the peculiarities of the proposals made here . while the previous subsections made the unusual claim that hypothetical primordial biology applies to modern technology , this section is perhaps more obscure in its assertion that inferences about prebiotic systems can be made based on observations in biotechnology .",
    "this all stems from the unorthodox nature of the biomimicry presented here which is mimicking the physical environment in which the biological system is immersed , not the biology itself .",
    "a simulation of nucleotide flow , ligation , and cleavage encompassing all physical factors thought to be in play in prebiotic hydrothermal vents was conducted .",
    "vent thermodynamics were shown to induce oscillations of temperature from each particle s perspective which result in a polymerase chain reaction - like process ( quasi - pcr ) .",
    "values for the rate constant for hydrogen bond degradation could not be obtained from the literature because a more precise denaturation model was derived in this paper that yields accurate kinetics for the large range of temperatures over which quasi - pcr operates .",
    "nonetheless , it was shown that the reaction can progress effectively over several orders of magnitude of this constant .",
    "thus one can be confident that reactions like the quasi - pcr _",
    "could _ proceed in prebiotic systems .",
    "however , due to the nature of studying the origin of life , one can never be certain if this was truly the reaction that provided the critical transition from inert organic compounds to the self - replicating information - storing pioneer molecules of the rna world .",
    "this specificity is not needed for the results of this paper to be significant because , as discussed in section 6 , quasi - pcr provides a very general framework for spontaneous polymerization that is fundamentally analogous to both the urey - miller experiment and diversity through radiation - induced mutation .",
    "the fact the quasi - pcr _ can _ occur , regardless of whether it did motivates the conclusion that this instrumental transition in the origin of life without which the rna world hypothesis has no credibility _ is _ thermodynamically possible .",
    "the biotechnology application was an unexpected implication of what began as a pursuit in pure biology .",
    "the initial computer simulations appear promising , but as discussed earlier , the `` experiments '' are were not yet carefully controlled .",
    "the most definitive conclusion on nonlinear pcr will be reached once the variational calculus approach ( in progress ) is completed .",
