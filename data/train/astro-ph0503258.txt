    "investigating the redshift - space distribution of galaxies has long been regarded as a fundamental aspect of observational cosmology .",
    "the primary statistical tool for characterizing galaxy clustering is the spatial two point correlation function , @xmath12 since , in the current paradigm of structure formation , the galaxy two - point correlation function is directly related to the initial power spectrum of mass density fluctuations .",
    "this is true as long as galaxies trace the underlying mass density field .",
    "however , it is now well established that the clustering of galaxies at low redshift depends on a variety of factors , implying that not all types of galaxies can be regarded as unbiased mass tracers .",
    "the clustering of optically selected galaxies has been found to depend on galaxy luminosity ( norberg 2002 and reference therein ) , morphological and spectral type ( hermit 1996 , zehavi 2002 , magdwick 2003 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the clustering of infrared selected galaxies seems to depend on their infrared color ( hawkins 2001 ) rather than on luminosity ( szapudi 2000 ) .    the evidence that different galaxy populations might give different biased pictures of the mass distribution has complicated but also enriched the interpretation of galaxy clustering .",
    "indeed , the very fact that the spatial clustering of galaxies is related to their physical properties represents an important observational test for all theories of galaxy formation .",
    "in particular , strong constraints on galaxy evolution models can be obtained by measuring the relative clustering of different extragalactic objects as a function of redshifts , for which very deep galaxy samples are required .",
    "several deep redshift surveys of optically selected galaxies , like the keck surveys of the goods - north ( wirth 2004 ) and goods - south ( vanzella 2004 ) fields and the deep2 redshift survey ( davis 2003 ) , are currently being performed .",
    "first results based on early data look very promising indeed .",
    "the analysis of coil ( 2004 ) has shown that the two - point correlation function of deep2 galaxies with a median redshift @xmath13 is consistent with that measured by adelberger(2003 ) in a very deep ( @xmath14 ) sample of lyman break galaxies but is significantly smaller than the correlation measured in the local ( @xmath15 ) 2df galaxy sample . since 2df @xmath16-selected",
    "galaxies are known to trace the underlying mass density field in a unbiased way ( verde 2002 , lahav 2002 ) , the smaller correlation measured in deep2 survey implies that this is not a strongly biased sample of objects either , since the clustering of the dark mass is expected to decrease with redshift in a similar way ( coil 2004 ) .",
    "mid - infrared selected galaxies also constitutes a very interesting population of objects since they are also known to trace the underlying mass distribution in the local universe in an almost unbiased fashion .",
    "more precisely , it has been found that the fluctuations in their number density , @xmath17 is related to the underlying mass overdensity field @xmath18 through a simple , linear biasing relation @xmath19 ( tegmark , zaldarriaga & hamilton 2001 and taylor 2002 ) .",
    "another reason why mid - infrared selection is interesting is that luminosity in this band is approximately proportional to star - formation rate ( independent of dust ) , thus a mid - infrared sample of galaxies will highlight the distribution of star - formation activity at a particular epoch . clearly , it would be very important to quantify the clustering evolution of mid - infrared selected objects and compare it with that of optically selected galaxies .",
    "this is indeed the main goal of this work in which we analyze the clustering properties of sample of mid - infrared selected galaxies extracted from the elais redshift survey ( oliver 2000 ) and extending out to a redshift @xmath9 . according to la franca ( 2004 ) ,",
    "two main spectroscopic classes have been found to dominate the extragalactic population of these objects : star - forming galaxies ( from absorbed to extreme starbursts : @xmath20 ) , which account for 75% of the sources , and active galactic nuclei",
    "( excluded from this analysis ) which account for 25% of the sources .",
    "about 20% of the extragalactic elais sources are dust - enshrouded starburst galaxies , while passive galaxies are essentially absent from the sample .",
    "our analysis is performed in redshift - space and thus complements the previous work of gonzalez - solares .",
    "( 2004 ) who measured the angular correlation properties of a similar sample of elais galaxies that from which they have inferred their spatial correlation properties .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the elais - s1 galaxy redshift survey that we analyze in this work . in section 3",
    "we discuss our method of estimating the two - point correlation function , assess its robustness and evaluate its statistical uncertainties .",
    "the main results are presented in section 4 , and discussed in section 5 , in which we also draw our main conclusions .",
    "the european large - area _ iso _ survey ( elais , oliver 2000 ; rowan - robinson 2004 ) is the largest open time programme conducted by the _ iso _ satellite ( kessler 1996 ) .",
    "it covers an area of @xmath21 deg@xmath1 , divided in four fields ( n1 , n2 and n3 in the northern hemisphere and s1 in the southern one ) distributed across the sky in order to decrease the biases due to cosmic variance .",
    "the survey bands are at @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ; the @xmath2 one presents the highest density of galaxies ( serjeant 2000 , gruppioni 2002 , la franca 2004 ) , making it the best choice for a study of their clustering properties . in this work we concentrate on the southern area , s1 .",
    "this survey is made of nine raster observations , each covering @xmath26 arcmin@xmath1 .",
    "the final analysis catalog at 15 @xmath27 m in the s1 field has been released by lari ( 2001 ) covering an area of @xmath28 deg@xmath1 centered at @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 , @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 .",
    "it includes 462 mid - ir sources down to a flux limit of 0.5 mjy .",
    "we have restricted our analysis to a highly reliable subsample of 406 objects ( la franca 2004 ) .    a detailed description of the optical classification of the elais - s1 sources , size and completeness function of the areas used in our study , as well as the observed counts for each class of sources ( normal galaxies , starburst galaxies and agn ) are presented by la franca ( 2004 ) .",
    "the measure of the evolution of star - forming galaxies has been investigated by pozzi ( 2004 ) and gruppioni ( 2005 ) , while a first estimate of the luminosity function for type-1 agn has been presented by matute ( 2002 ) .",
    "elais@xmath35 ]    the central raster , s@xmath36 , has been observed three times and thus represents the deepest part of the sample . as a consequence",
    "the elais - s1 area has been divided into two regions : a ) the central and deepest part ( s@xmath36 ) which covers 0.55 deg@xmath1 and reaches a 20% completeness at fluxes of 0.7 mjy , and b ) the remaining area ( s1@xmath37 ) which covers 3.65 deg@xmath1 and reaches a 20% completeness at fluxes of 1.1 mjy .",
    "the optical analysis of the @xmath38 objects brings @xmath39 ( 80% ) optical identification on ccd exposures down to r@xmath4023 , and @xmath41 spectroscopic classifications ( 90% of the optically identified sample ) . of these",
    ", @xmath42 were found to be stars and @xmath43 extragalactic sources . among these",
    ", we kept only the galaxies with @xmath4 , because according to analyses based on the mean optical / mid - ir ratios of the sources , the sample is virtually @xmath44 spectroscopically complete down to this redshift ( la franca 2004 ) .",

    "our purpose is to estimate the redshift - space two point correlation function of elais - s1 galaxies and its uncertainties .",
    "it is worth stressing here that clustering in redshift - space is systematically different from the true one in real - space . on small scale ,",
    "velocity dispersion in virialized systems smears out structure along the line of sight , hence depressing the amplitude of @xmath12 at small separation . on large scales , coherent infall motions in high density regions or outflows from low density environments enhance structure along the line of sight and thus increase the amplitude of @xmath12 on the corresponding scales . here",
    "we make no attempt of correcting for redshift - space distortions .",
    "therefore , direct comparisons will only be made with similar measurements of the redshift - space two point correlation function of other galaxy redshift catalogs .",
    "several different methods have been proposed to estimate the two point correlation function . in this work",
    "we use the landy & szalay ( 1993 ) [ ls ] estimator that , according to extensive numerical tests , turned out to be the best suited for astrophysical applications ( kerscher , szapudi and szalay 2000 ) .    with the ls estimator a reliable and unbiased estimate of @xmath12 is obtained by cross - correlating the real dataset with a sample of fake objects lacking any spatial correlation which , however , suffers from the same selection effects and incompleteness of the real catalog . to obtain a sample of synthetic objects",
    "we first create a random sample of points uniformly distributed over the same area as the real dataset , and then we generate their redshift distribution constrained to match that of the real objects determined by pozzi ( 2004 ) . for each random catalog",
    "we generate 10 times the number of fake objects as real galaxies .",
    "the ls estimator is : @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 as the weighted data - data , data - random and random - random pair counts with redshift - space separation @xmath53 . @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the mean densities of galaxies and random objects , respectively .    the flux limited nature of our dataset is accounted for by weighting each galaxy by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the observed space density of galaxies at redshift @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( efstathiou 1988 ) . to implement this weighting scheme , that requires prior knowledge of @xmath12",
    ", we have adopted an iterative procedure in which we first compute @xmath12 using @xmath60 and then we fit a power law to the results in the range @xmath5 .",
    "then we compute the new weights @xmath61 by truncating the maximum value of @xmath62 to 1500 .",
    "only one iteration was needed to obtain a stable result .    to check the robustness of our results we have varied both the estimator of @xmath12 and the weighting scheme .",
    "more precisely , we have also used the estimators of hewett ( 1982 ) , davis & peebles ( 1983 ) and hamilton ( 1993 ) . moreover , for the case of the ls estimator only , we have implemented two alternative weighting schemes : the case of no weight ( i.e. @xmath60 ) and the case in which we weight by the inverse of the selection function ( i.e. @xmath63 ) . in all cases",
    "explored we have found that the various estimates of @xmath12 were consistent , within the errors , in the range @xmath5 .      to quantify the uncertainties in the estimate of @xmath12",
    "we have measured the correlation function in a sets of 30 independent mock galaxy catalogs designed to mimic the properties of the real elais - s1 sample .",
    "these mock catalogs were constructed from the n - body numerical experiment labelled @xmath64 performed by cole ( 1998 ) .",
    "their simulation assumes a flat @xmath65cdm model cosmology with @xmath66 , @xmath67 an rms fluctuation of the mass contained in spheres of radius @xmath68 , @xmath69 and and a cdm power spectrum with shape parameter @xmath70 .",
    "the simulation box side is @xmath71 and has @xmath72 particles .    to construct each mock catalog",
    "we have used three different output of the simulations ( corresponding to redshifts z=0 , z=0.33 and z=0.5 ) and took advantage of the periodic boundary conditions to obtain different configurations of points in each box by re - centering the coordinate system on a particle chosen at random .",
    "we have then stacked six boxes in order of increasing redshift ( three of them at z=0 , two at z=0.33 and one at z=0.5 ) , placed the observer at the center of the first box and identified the x coordinate with the direction of stacking .",
    "we have then identified the direction of the x axis with the center of the elais field and considered all particles within an area of @xmath28 deg@xmath1 from the field centre . to assign each particle a redshift",
    "we have used the distance to redshift relation for a flat , @xmath65cdm universe @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the comoving distance , and then added the line of sight component of the particle peculiar velocity .",
    "finally , a population of mock galaxies have been extracted from the particles through a montecarlo rejection procedure designed to match the observed redshift distribution of real elais galaxies in both the inner @xmath75 arcmin@xmath1 s@xmath36-like , and the outer s1@xmath49-like samples .",
    "this procedure has been repeated to obtain 30 mock elais - s1 samples , containing @xmath76 objects each , for which we have evaluated the two - point correlation function .",

    "these results have been obtained using the ls estimator for @xmath12 and by evaluating the errors from a set of 30 mock elais - s1 catalogs .",
    "these results are robust , in the sense that they do not change significantly when varying the method of estimating @xmath12 ( see section 3.1 ) or when using different strategies to assess the errors ( sections 3.2 and 4 ) .",

    "table 1 shows our result together with the corresponding results obtained from some of the major galaxy redshift surveys , characterized by their passband / wavelength of selection ( column 2 ) and the redshift ranges they cover ( column 3 ) .",
    "it is worth stressing that deviations of the two point correlation function from a pure power law shape are more serious in redshift - space than in real - space , making it difficult to compare results obtained from the analyses of different galaxy samples . to ensure a fair comparison , all best fit parameters listed in columns 4 and 5 of table 1 refer to ranges of separations where all measured @xmath12 are well approximated by a power law .",
    "these ranges turned out to be very close to that of @xmath113\\hmpc$ ] considered in our analysis , although some of the parameters in the table have been obtained by pushing the estimate of @xmath12 down to scale as small as @xmath114 ( the 2dfgrs case ) or up to separations as large as @xmath115 ( as in the case of the lcrs sample ) .",
    "our results are fully consistent with those obtained from the analysis of the psc@xmath8 survey ( hawkins 2001 ) , that consists of @xmath116 _ iras _ galaxies selected at @xmath117 , i.e. in a mid - infrared band similar to that of elais galaxies .",
    "this sample is , however , much more local than ours and thus the agreement between the two results indicates that the clustering properties of mid - infrared selected objects do not evolve significantly between @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",

    "( @xmath10 ) and _ distant _ ( @xmath85 ) elais - s1 subsamples .",
    "unfortunately , the large uncertainties in our estimate of @xmath12 , that mainly result from the sparseness of the elais - s1 galaxy catalog , do not allow to set strong constraints on the clustering evolution .",
    "the lack of significant evolution in the elais galaxy clustering has already been noticed by gonzalez - solares ( 2004 ) . in their analysis , that consisted in deprojecting the angular correlation function of elais galaxies via limber equation , they have measured a real - space two point correlation function with a slope ( @xmath120 ) and a correlation length ( @xmath121 ) that are fully consistent with those measured in the psc@xmath8 catalog ( @xmath120 and @xmath122 , jing , brner & suto ( 2002 ) ) .",
    "it is worth stressing that difference between our result and that of gonzalez - solares ( 2004 ) originates from systematic redshift space distortions that affect our analysis and result in a shallower slope and a larger correlation length of the two point - correlation function .",
    "focusing on the mid - infrared objects is of considerable interest since they trace the underlying mass distribution in the local universe .",
    "the consistency that we have found between the @xmath12 in the real sample and the one measured in our mock elais - s1 catalogs in which galaxies are identified with the particles of the parent n - body simulation , suggests that mid - infrared selected galaxies are indeed almost unbiased tracers of the underlying mass density field out to @xmath9 .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results with those obtained using optically - selected galaxy samples , some of which is listed in table 1 .",
    "we confirm the well known fact that infrared selected objects are significantly less clustered than optical galaxies , although the discrepancy depends on the depth of the sample and ( mainly ) on the selection band , being larger for sdss , @xmath103 selected objects than for 2df galaxies selected in the @xmath16 band .    investigating how this discrepancy change with redshift , i.e. how the relative clustering of different objects evolve with time , is of fundamental importance since it will allow to cast light on the galaxy formation and evolution processes . while this work constitutes an early step in this direction , strong observational constraints for theories of galaxy evolution",
    "will only be obtained by extending and improving samples like elais - s1 , which implies carrying out larger and deeper infrared redshift surveys like that already planned in the swire programme ( lonsdale 2003 ) .",
