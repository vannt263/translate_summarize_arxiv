    "the primary goal of the cnoc ( canadian network for observational cosmology ) cluster redshift survey is to obtain a value of density parameter , @xmath3 , for those components of the mass field ( possibly all ) that participate in gravitational clustering ( carlberg  1996 , hereafter cnoci ) .",
    "the product of the field luminosity density , @xmath4 , with its mass - to - light ratio , @xmath5 , estimates the mean mass density of the universe , @xmath6 ( @xcite ) , which in ratio to the critical density , @xmath7 is equal to @xmath3 ( @xcite ) , when calculated in current epoch co - ordinates .",
    "the crucial quantity is an estimator of the field mass - to - light ratio , for which we use the cluster virial mass - to - light ratio , @xmath8 .",
    "the main technical concern of the cnoc survey is that there are various possibilities that @xmath9 is a biased estimator of the cluster mass . besides statistical biases",
    ", dissipative processes can cause the cluster galaxies to become more centrally concentrated than the cluster mass .",
    "in addition , when estimating the field @xmath5 from the cluster results , allowance must be made for the differences between the cluster and field galaxy populations .    to address these issues a sample of high x - ray luminosity galaxy clusters",
    "were selected from the emss catalogue ( @xcite ) .",
    "this produces a relatively homogenous set of 16 clusters that likely contain a substantial virialized component .",
    "the sample , at a mean redshift of about , gives a substantial column in redshift space which we use to calculate the field luminosity density in precisely the same measurement system as the cluster light .",
    "the galaxies were selected with no knowledge of the colour or whether they were cluster members , although great care is taken to control the selection effects that are unavoidable to maintain efficiency ( @xcite ) .    from these data we calculated the line - of - sight velocity dispersions , @xmath10 , and virial radii , @xmath11 , of the clusters to derive the virial masses ( @xcite ) , @xmath12 .",
    "the velocity dispersions are calculated with an iterative technique that statistically removes interlopers by taking advantage of the relatively large foreground and background sample to estimate interloper densities ( @xcite ) .",
    "this technique leads to velocity dispersions that are on the average 7% less than those found from precisely the same data in the redshift range , and about 13% less with a somewhat less restrictive redshift cut , even when evaluated with the iterated bi - weight estimator ( @xcite ) .",
    "the virial radius is calculated from the data in the redshift range of the cluster with a `` ring - wise '' potential estimator , which allows correction for the strip sampling and helps reduce the noise ( details are given in @xcite ) .",
    "all these global quantities are derived from the individual galaxy positions , velocities , colors and luminosities , for which objective errors are calculated using the jackknife method ( @xcite ) .",
    "the errors are sufficiently small that the assumption of a symmetric distribution is appropriate and is verified by comparing to bootstrap error estimates .",
    "the average cluster virial mass - to - light ( @xmath13 band , k - corrected ) ratio is @xmath14 ( @xcite ) . in the field , over the same redshift range , with the same sampling and corrections , the closure mass - to - light ratio is @xmath15 ( in co - moving units , for @xmath16 ) .",
    "there are two additional corrections applied to @xmath17 .",
    "the mean luminosity of galaxies brighter than @xmath18 of @xmath19 mag is @xmath20 lower in the cluster than the field and the analysis of the mass profile ( carlberg , yee & ellingson 1997 , hereafter @xcite ) showed that @xmath9 needed to be multiplied by @xmath21 , which we attribute to neglecting the surface term in the virial mass estimator .",
    "making these corrections leads to a redshift adjusted @xmath22 .",
    "our conclusion that the stellar - hydrodynamical ( shd ) mass profile of the clusters averaged together closely follows the number density profile of the galaxies ( @xcite ) rests on the assumption that the clusters are effectively in equilibrium such that the jeans equation can be used to derive the mass profile from the radial and velocity distribution of any tracer population . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that two radically different tracer populations are consistent with the same underlying mass profile , which we take as strong support of the equilibrium assumption . in the following section we describe the division of the sample into two completely disjoint blue and red subsamples , whose surface density and projected velocity dispersion profiles are measured and",
    "demonstrate the gross differences in the calculated virial masses .",
    "in section 3 we derive the stellar - hydrodynamical potential generating mass profiles in which the galaxies are orbiting .",
    "the implications of the statistical equality of the two profiles are discussed in the final section .",
    "all calculations in this paper assume @xmath23 and @xmath16 , although the results are either independent or not sensitive to these choices .",
    "the cnoc cluster redshift survey catalogues ( @xcite ) contain @xmath242600 galaxies having gunn @xmath13 magnitudes , @xmath25 colors , and redshifts .",
    "the sample is split at the color @xmath26^{-1}$ ] of @xmath27 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is approximately the color of an sab galaxy , which roughly divides galaxies into spheroid dominated , `` old '' stellar systems and disk dominated , `` young '' stellar systems .",
    "fourteen clusters are averaged together after removing two `` binary '' clusters .    to a limit of @xmath28 mag ,",
    "about 70% of the cluster galaxies fall into the red subsample .",
    "the methods of analysis are precisely the same as used previously for the full sample ( @xcite ) .",
    "the velocities are normalized to the @xmath10 of each cluster calculated from galaxies of all colors so that the two subsamples have a common reference .",
    "the rms velocity dispersions of the red and blue galaxies are @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , in units where the velocities are normalized to the velocity dispersions of all the galaxies in each cluster .",
    "that is , the velocity dispersion of blue cluster galaxies is about 30% higher than for red galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the projected radii are normalized to @xmath31 , the radius at which the mean interior overdensity in a cluster is @xmath32 .",
    "the quantity @xmath33 is the hubble constant at the redshift of the cluster .",
    "the virial radii , @xmath11 , are @xmath34 and @xmath35 for red and blue galaxies , respectively , in 200  units . in ratio to the sample as a whole , the average virial masses are @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively , for red and blue subsamples",
    ". the ratio of these two virial masses is @xmath2 .",
    "as is well known , the red galaxies in clusters are much more centrally concentrated than the blue galaxies (  @xcite ) .",
    "our data usefully illustrate that the galaxy color selection can make a very large difference to the estimated mass",
    ". in general , blue or emission line selected galaxies will always give higher mass estimates than absorption line galaxies .",
    "the projected surface number density profiles , @xmath38 of the two subsamples are displayed in figure  [ fig : surf ] .",
    "the profiles are fitted to the projection of the density function ( @xcite ) , @xmath39 by adjusting @xmath40 and @xmath41 to minimize the residuals .",
    "the fits give scale radii @xmath41 of @xmath42 and @xmath43 for red and blue populations , respectively .",
    "for the sample as a whole @xmath44 . in both cases",
    "the @xmath45 per degree of freedom is about 0.8 , with the errors estimated as the average of the upper and lower @xmath46 confidence range from the bootstrap analysis .    the observed projected velocity dispersion , @xmath47 ,",
    "can be used to infer the real space radial velocity dispersion , @xmath48 , via , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the velocity anisotropy parameter .",
    "the parameters of @xmath51 are adjusted until the @xmath45 with the observed @xmath47 are minimized .",
    "the data and the fits for two values of @xmath52 are displayed in figure  [ fig : sig ] .",
    "again the errors are from the symmetrized bootstrap confidence range .",
    "the mass distribution in which the galaxies are in orbital equilibrium can be inferred with no assumption about the relative distribution of mass and galaxies from the projected velocity dispersion profile , @xmath47 , and the projected galaxy density distribution , @xmath38 . remarkably , we found ( @xcite ) that the integrated galaxy number density profile , @xmath53 , of our full sample is statistically indistinguishable from the integrated mass profile , @xmath54 .",
    "mass profiles are derived from the fitted @xmath55 and @xmath48 using the jeans equation ( @xcite ) , @xmath56 .",
    "\\label{eq : jeans}\\ ] ] we will call this mass the stellar hydrodynamical mass . the resulting @xmath57 from the red and blue galaxies are shown in figure  [ fig : mol ] for @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the quantity plotted is the virial mass - to - light bias , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is an arbitrary normalization of the total light that cancels between numerator and denominator .",
    "the quantity @xmath62 is the normalization of the virial mass of the dimensionless sample as a whole , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "if the virial mass calculated from the sample as a whole gave the correct @xmath5 at all radii then @xmath66 everywhere .",
    "if the tracer population follows the true mass profile but with some scale error , then @xmath67 will be a constant other than unity .",
    "figure  [ fig : mol ] shows that beyond about @xmath68 the mass profiles deduced from the two subsamples are identical within their errors ( about 15 and 30% for red and blue mass profiles , respectively ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : mvbias ] shows the value of @xmath67 evaluated at 200 , demonstrating that the blue and red subsamples give statistically identical values .",
    "furthermore the value is always less than unity , as we found for the sample as a whole ( @xcite ) which has the implication that although the galaxy numbers fairly accurately trace the cluster mass profile the virial mass to light ratio is always an overestimate of the mean @xmath5 inside 200 .",
    "there is no statistically significant radial gradient of @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "there are several important conclusions to be drawn from figure  [ fig : mol ] .",
    "first , it provides strong evidence that the blue and red galaxies are sufficiently in equilibrium with the cluster mass distribution that these dynamical methods work to recover the true mass profile .",
    "second , the fitted scale radius of the mass profile ( taken to be equal to that of the full sample ) @xmath44 , is slightly more extended than the red galaxies ( @xcite ) @xmath71 , but is substantially more compact than the blue galaxy distribution , @xmath72 , all measured in 200  units .",
    "the differences in scale radii imply that neither the blue nor the red galaxies are distributed like the mass , so the virial masses calculated from these subsamples are not correct .",
    "the densities and velocity dispersions of the red and blue galaxy subsamples , although very different from each other , imply a statistically identical mass profile for the cluster potential .",
    "this is necessary if both populations are in equilibrium with the potential , validating our use of the jeans equation .",
    "this mass profile is statistically identical to the number density distribution of all the galaxies of our full sample .",
    "the limiting factor in the precise numerical agreement is that there are relatively few blue galaxies in clusters , meaning that their density and velocity dispersion profiles are less accurately measured .",
    "there are problems and issues that can not be addressed with a sample of this size .",
    "a much larger sample would likely find that a common value of @xmath52 would not work for both red and blue galaxies , since it is expected that on the average blue galaxies will avoid the core , hence near the centre have smaller @xmath52 than the red galaxies , and at large radius include many objects on their first cluster crossing , hence have higher @xmath52 than the red galaxies .",
    "furthermore the galaxies themselves are not invariant mass points .",
    "the blue galaxies are being altered by the cluster environment such that some of the their members are likely leaving the blue population to join the red population ( @xcite ) .",
    "the virial mass calculated from the full sample , empirically adjusted for its measurement biases , will correctly estimate the mass enclosed . with these two subsamples",
    "we have now tested each step in the chain of logic which supports our corrected , population adjusted value of @xmath22 .",
    "there is no compelling evidence for any remaining systematic errors of the cluster @xmath5 as an estimator of the field value over the redshift range of this sample .",
    "we thank the canadian time assignment committee of the cfht for allocations of observing time , and the cfht organization for the technical support which made these observations feasible .",
