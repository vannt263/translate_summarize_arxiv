    "the peierls instability towards spatially broken symmetry is an important phenomenon in low dimensional materials @xcite .",
    "the one - dimensional ( 1d ) case has been widely discussed in the context of polyacetylene ( ch)@xmath1 based on the su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) model @xcite , where lattice displacements couple to electron hopping . for a half - filled band arbitrary small electron - lattice",
    "( e - l ) coupling will induce a lattice dimerization ( disregarding quantum lattice fluctuations ) , which is associated with a periodic modulation of the bond hopping , that is , a so called on - bond charge - density wave or bond - order wave ( bow ) @xcite .",
    "it has been established that the hubbard on - site coulomb electron - electron ( e - e ) interaction @xmath2 will enhance the bond alternation initially for small values and finally suppress it at large values of @xmath2 @xcite .    in two dimensions",
    "few theoretical investigations exist @xcite , some of which connect the physics of peierls systems to that of the high-@xmath3 copper oxides @xcite",
    ". moreover , these investigations may be of direct relevance to those quasi - two dimensional ( 2d ) materials which show a peierls instability such as transition - metal oxide bronzes like amo@xmath4o@xmath5 ( a = na , k , tl ) @xcite and organic conductors like ( bedt - ttf)@xmath6hg(scn)@xmath7 ( @xmath8=k , rb , tl ) @xcite . as an effective minimal model , in this context ,",
    "the 2d version of the ssh model was investigated @xcite . with only nearest - neighbour ( n.n . ) hopping on a square lattice , the electronic fermi surface is perfectly nested at half - filling with nesting vector @xmath9 . two possible alternation patterns for the lattice distortion and the concurrent bond hopping comply with this @xmath10 , as illustrated in fig .  [ fig : pattern ] .",
    "whereas for pattern ( a ) the dimerization is in both directions , it is only in one direction for pattern ( b ) @xcite .",
    "similar to the 1d case , already for an infinitesimal e - l coupling , the 2d ssh model goes through a peierls instability into one of the dimerized states of fig .",
    "[ fig : pattern ] @xcite .    when a hubbard on - site coulomb interaction @xmath2 is included",
    " the model is then the so called peierls - hubbard model , results differ from the 1d case .",
    "numerical calculations on a small 2d lattice @xcite indicated that the peierls instability will be suppressed by the hubbard @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "an intuitive explanation is that the on - site coulomb interaction favors a spin - density wave ( sdw ) long - range order , that is , antiferromagnetism ( afm ) , while the dimerization associated with bow harmonizes with a spin - singlet formation between those two n.n .",
    "spins which are connected by a strong bond . as we know , due to the same nesting effect , the pure 2d half - filled hubbard model ( without consideration of a peierls instability ) has been shown to exhibit afm long - range order for any @xmath11 .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the corresponding 1d case where no true long - range afm order is available and the correlated state rather corresponds to a resonant valence bond state with strong weight from n.n .",
    "singlets @xcite .",
    "consequently , one may envisage , for finite e - l coupling ( denoted as @xmath12 , see below ) and e - e on - site interaction @xmath2 , a competition between bow and afm as the underlying physics in the 2d half - filled peierls - hubbard model . in the large @xmath2 limit ,",
    "zhang and prelovsek have studied the corresponding spin - peierls ( sp ) instability and found that the sp state , competing with afm , does not appear unless the spin - lattice coupling ( analogous to @xmath12 here ) exceeds a threshold @xcite .",
    "the details of the competition between the two ordered states were studied only for the above limiting case and the situation is not clear for general values of @xmath12 and @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , a basic problem has to be solved : does bow disappear once the afm order sets in , or is a coexistence of the two orders possible ?",
    "it was previously argued by mazumdar within a real space approach that the appearance of the afm should coincide with the disappearance of the bow @xcite , which was , however , not verified . to clarify this issue",
    " which is the topic of this paper , one needs to explicitly calculate the two order parameters for the bow and afm with varying @xmath12 and/or @xmath2 .    in this paper",
    "we make use of both the hartree - fock ( hf ) and kotliar - ruckenstein slave - boson ( sb ) approach @xcite to treat the hubbard interaction .",
    "the hf results are usually valid at weak - coupling , and they can be used as a basis for further elaborate studies . in the context of investigations on density wave instabilities , the hf theory may give reasonable results even in one dimension @xcite , where one would expect it to be worst because of strong fluctuations . in dimensions higher than one , as considered here , qualitatively correct results are expected from the hf theory . in order to extend the controlled weak - coupling results to intermediate values of @xmath2",
    ", we evaluate bow and afm within a slave boson mean - field approach , which is considered to be appropriate to interpolate from weak to strong coupling @xcite .",

    "we constrain the discussion to the lattice distortions within the two commonly used dimerization patterns shown in fig .",

    "the unphysical states in the enlarged hilbert space are eliminated by imposing two sets of local constraints : @xmath57 and @xmath58 for a bipartite lattice , we introduce a set of bosons , with separate lagrange multipliers for each sublattice . at the mean - field level , the bosons are replaced by c - numbers and assumed to be site - independent on each sublattice . at the same time , the constraints above are softened to be satisfied only on the average on each sublattice .",

    "( [ eq : m ] ) can be always solved with a nonzero solution of @xmath38 as long as @xmath11 . for pattern ( b )",
    "it is not always the case because the rhs is finite at @xmath53 for any @xmath90 .",

    "let us go to the details in the following .    in hf",
    "( see all the thin lines ) , it is found that for pattern ( a ) @xmath38 becomes finite ( although small at small @xmath2 ) and simultaneously @xmath50 begins to decrease once @xmath11 ; while for pattern ( b ) @xmath38 stays zero for small @xmath2 up to @xmath92 where it becomes finite and correspondingly , @xmath50 first keeps its @xmath32 value and then starts to decrease for @xmath93 .",
    "the dimerization disappears at the same critical value @xmath94 for both patterns and it approaches zero smoothly and quickly when @xmath2 is close to @xmath95 . comparing the results for @xmath38 vs. @xmath2 between the two patterns ,",
    "it is clear that pattern ( a ) is more favorable to the formation of afm order than pattern ( b ) .",
    "we will come to this point later .",
    "most of the above qualitative results are also found in sb approach ( see all the thick lines ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the difference to the hf results is clear as well , which we want to emphasize here .",
    "a distinct quantitative difference is that for each of the patterns the afm order derived from sb theory is ( much ) weaker than that from hf theory , and correspondingly the dimerization decreases to zero over a larger range of @xmath2 .",
    "the critical value for the disappearance of @xmath50 now becomes @xmath96 , and the necessary hubbard interaction to induce finite @xmath38 in the case of pattern ( b ) is @xmath97 .",
    "both values are larger than the corresponding ones from the hf theory , which is understandable .",
    "as is well known , the hf theory usually overestimates the tendency towards afm order .",
    "the sb theory , as an improved approach to fluctuation contributions , should lead to a slower formation of afm , which complies with our findings .",
    "a further important difference between the sb and hf results is observed in the region @xmath98 for pattern ( b ) , where the afm order has not yet formed . from the solid lines in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : op ] , it is seen that the dimerization @xmath50 keeps a constant value in hf theory , while it decreases slowly with increase of @xmath2 in sb theory .",
    "this disagreement may be understood as follows . in hf",
    "theory , see e.g. , eq .  ( [ eq : hfb ] ) ,",
    "the hubbard @xmath2 becomes irrelevant once the order parameter @xmath38 is zero : the value for @xmath50 will be the same as that without @xmath2 . in the sb approach , however , the hubbard @xmath2 is relevant even at @xmath53 by affecting the probability of double occupancy @xmath99",
    ". as @xmath2 increases , the double occupancy is disfavored , i.e. , the quantity @xmath99 decreases .",
    "correspondingly the effective hopping @xmath100 decreases too ( cf . the expression for @xmath101 in the appendix ) , which may be understood equivalently as an increase of the elastic constant @xmath30 or a reduction of the e - l coupling @xmath12 .",
    "this signifies a decreasing dimerization . in this point",
    "the hf theory fails to catch the correct physics by assuming the probability of double occupancy as a constant @xmath102 which is correct only for @xmath103 .",
    "furthermore , we can check the stability between both patterns by comparison of the ground state energies calculated in all cases , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eg ] . for each pattern",
    "the sb approach gives a lower energy than the hf theory in the whole range of @xmath2 .",
    "also , it is seen within each approach that pattern ( b ) has a lower energy than pattern ( a ) , which signifies that pattern ( b ) is more stable .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that the bow is always associated with the finite dimerization . in order to see this ,",
    "we have calculated the bow which is characterized by a modulation of the hopping amplitude .",
    "explicitly , we define the expectation values @xmath104 , @xmath105 ( @xmath17 is irrelevant ) for the alternating bond hoppings along the @xmath19 axis , and similar values @xmath106 , @xmath107 for the hoppings along the @xmath21 axis . by symmetry",
    ", we have @xmath108 for pattern ( a ) and @xmath109 for pattern ( b ) .",
    "all the quantities are calculated in both theories and plotted as functions of @xmath2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : bow ] .",
    "the bow is exhibited by the inequality between @xmath110 and @xmath111 for each pattern @xcite .",
    "it is clear for each approach that such an inequality is present within @xmath112 , the same region where the dimerization is finite .",
    "numerically , tang and hirsch @xcite studied the same model and calculated the energy gain from dimerization as a function of @xmath2 for the pattern ( b ) shown here . by studying how the energy gain changes with @xmath2",
    ", they found originally that the hubbard @xmath2 has little effect on the dimerization until it is large enough to suppress it , and later corrected that the dimerization is disfavored as soon as @xmath2 is present .",
    "the finite - size effect was cautioned by the authors themselves . their principal result ,",
    "i.e. , the hubbard @xmath2 is unfavorable to dimerization , is consistent with ours , especially with the sb results for pattern ( b ) .",
    "although it seems that the suppression of dimerization by @xmath2 is faster in our results than what they displayed , no direct comparison is available because they calculated neither the order parameters nor the ground state energies .",
    "obviously , further numerical calculations on large size systems are necessary for better comparison .",
    "the main contribution in our work is that the order parameters as functions of @xmath2 are explicitly obtained so that the interplay between bow and afm becomes transparent .",
    "the problem proposed in the introduction is then naturally answered .",
    "it is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : op ] that the bow and afm may coexist for both patterns . for pattern ( a ) the coexistence ( i.e. , @xmath113 ) appears as long as @xmath11 and pure afm order exists for @xmath114 . for pattern ( b ) the coexistence is limited to the region @xmath115 .",
    "these results are not favorable to the argument by mazumdar that the afm emerges with the disappearance of the bow @xcite . in fact , the valence bond approach adopted by mazumdar in real space is appealing .",
    "it states that , in order to implement a symmetry - broken state ( e.g. , bow ) , `` extreme configurations '' with shortest repeat units have to be identified . for 2d systems , he chose pattern ( a ) as the realization of the peierls state and argued that the extreme configuration for bow is a combination of zigzag chains and the n.n .",
    "sites within each chain are doubly occupied and unoccupied , respectively .",
    "however , the pattern selected in his work is not the pattern with the lowest energy and furthermore , the considered extreme configuration is actually disfavored , even for weak coulomb on - site interaction , as is verified in the exact @xmath103 approach of this paper .",
    "it implies that spin fluctuations are more pronounced than charge fluctuations in the bow state of the half - filled system .",
    "eventually , we determine the coexistence regions for different @xmath12 in both theories .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ph ] , where different phases are indicated in the parameter plane @xmath116 . for pattern ( a ) ,",
    "only two phases exist , either a state with coexisting bow and afm or a pure afm state .",
    "however for pattern ( b ) pure bow and afm states exist , which are separated by a coexisting state  the region between two thick ( sb ) or thin ( hf ) lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : ph ] . as for the methods , globally speaking , the sb approach pushes the afm order to the higher @xmath2 regime than the hf theory .",
    "finally , we come back to the difference between the results for the two patterns . as explained above , pattern ( a ) is more favorable to the development of afm than pattern ( b ) .",
    "it may be roughly understood from their different dimerization structures . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : pattern ] , for pattern ( b ) , each site is connected to only one n.n .",
    "site by a strong bond when the bow ( or dimerization ) forms .",
    "thus a spin singlet on this strong bond is apt to prevail in presence of @xmath2 , which will resist the afm . on the other hand , for pattern ( a ) , each site connects two n.n . sites with strong bonds .",
    "this , on the contrary , makes the construction of spin singlets on these strong bonds difficult and the afm is easier to develop .",
    "we have investigated the peierls - hubbard model in two dimensions at half - filling within both hf and sb approach .",
    "two dimerization patterns , corresponding to the same wavevector @xmath0 , are considered and the interplay between two long - range order states , bow and afm , is addressed . for each pattern , it is found that the peierls dimerization ( and associated bow ) is weakened by the on - site interaction @xmath2 as soon as @xmath2 is present and finally suppressed at a critical @xmath117 .",
    "correspondingly , the afm is favored by @xmath2 .",
    "whereas for pattern ( a ) , see fig .",

    "the coexistence of bow and afm is possible .",

    "<S> the two - dimensional peierls - hubbard model is studied at half - filling within both hartree - fork and kotliar - ruckenstein slave - boson theory . </S>",
    "<S> the interplay between two types of long - range order , bond - order wave ( bow ) and antiferromagnetism ( afm ) , is analysed for two representative dimerization patterns , corresponding both to the same wavevector @xmath0 . for each pattern , </S>",
    "<S> the peierls dimerization ( and associated bow ) is weakened and finally suppressed with increasing hubbard on - site interaction , and correspondingly afm is gradually enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , a coexistence regime with both bow and afm order is established in the parameter space of electron - lattice and hubbard interactions . </S>"
