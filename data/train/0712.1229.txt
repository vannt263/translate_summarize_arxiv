    "members of the coldest brown dwarf spectral type currently observed , the `` t '' class @xcite , are now being discovered quite regularly thanks to a growing archive of optical and near - infrared survey data . as a result ,",
    "this sample of once - rare objects has increased dramatically from the handful known only a few years ago @xcite , to the dozens gradually retrieved by searches through dedicated surveys @xcite , and ultimately towards what is predicted to be the bulk discovery of hundreds in the next few years @xcite . as the growth of this discovered population continues , the study of t dwarfs has also naturally expanded to ever more detailed examination of their physical properties , and",
    "has fueled observations of rarer , but highly interesting properties , such as binarity , _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "the advance in the discovery rate of t dwarfs has been a direct product of the coupling of optical and near - infrared survey techniques . with the development of the _ ukirt _ infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the opportunity for automated candidate identification has grown enormously .",
    "the first t dwarf discoveries from ukidss are confirming the survey s powerful red object finding capability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present the first results of our ongoing search for the reddest objects in the ukidss data : the coolest brown dwarfs and very high redshift quasars .",
    "we have found three spectroscopically confirmed early- to late - t dwarfs in the ukidss dr1 area of approximately 150 square degrees , and one strong photometrically / spectroscopically identified early - t candidate , and we describe the techniques used to identify these objects , their followup , and characterization .",
    "we also compare the sample with other discovered brown dwarfs in this area , and discuss predictions of brown dwarf discovery rates for the full ukidss project . in this paper ,",
    "all near - ir magnitudes are expressed in the ukidss vega - normalized system .",
    "( note that the @xmath5 band photometry used here does not include a possibly necessary correction of 0.1 mag ; see warren et al .",
    "2007a for details ) .",
    "however , accompanying photometry in the optical @xmath6 bands are on the ab system , as used by the sdss project @xcite .",
    "this work is based on the ukidss first data release ( dr1 ) , and was aimed at mining the southern equatorial stripe , pioneered by the sdss ( stripe 82 ) .",
    "the las ( large area survey ) , the wide and shallow sub - survey of ukidss , imaged this area partially over the 2005b semester , covering approximately 136 square degrees to a depth of [ @xmath7=[20.2 , 19.6 , 18.8 , 18.2 ] ( @xmath2 , vega ) .",

    "these four new faint t dwarfs were drawn from a searched area defined by the overlap of the ukidss dr1 dataset with the sdss southern equatorial stripe , which ranges from ra @xmath022@xmath8 to 4@xmath8 , and dec @xmath9 .",
    "we calculate this overlap to be approximately 136 square degrees by rectangular approximation using a 0.2 degree mesh , but with uncertainty of @xmath1010% due to incomplete ukidss tiling and areas lost due to extremely bright stars and other normal imaging defects . in this area , collaborators concurrently identified four other new t dwarfs ranging from type t4.5 to t8.5 , which we also selected during this search , but did not pursue independently ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one other t dwarf ( t4 , sdss j0207 + 0000 ) was reconfirmed , having been found previously in the sdss data alone @xcite . including our present sample then",
    ", this brings the total number of t dwarfs to nine in this area , down to a searched magnitude limit of @xmath1 .    a recent estimate of t dwarf numbers in the ukidss las complete area",
    "is provided by @xcite ( hereafter dh06 ) , based on a projection of 4000 square degrees reaching a depth of @xmath11=[20.5,20.0,18.8,18.4]$ ] . aside from the increased area , this differs from the present dr1 flux limits by an increase of 0.4 mag in depth of the @xmath12 imaging ( @xmath13 , @xmath2 , warren et al .",
    "this is because the las @xmath12 band is planned to have a second epoch of imaging to aid determination of proper motions , among other goals .",
    "also , their assumed limiting @xmath5 magnitude is slightly deeper than that actually achieved by the survey ( @xmath14 , @xmath2 ) . with these flux limits , and depending on various assumed initial mass functions ( imf ) and birthrates ,",
    "the dh06 discovery estimates for the ukidss las survey are from 321 to 1375 early t dwarfs , 657 to 2014 late t dwarfs , and 25 to 100 y dwarfs , which deacon and hambly operationally define as objects with @xmath15 . at present , the actual spectral criteria and @xmath16 that would warrant a new type are unknown , though the presence of nh@xmath17 absorption features is expected to be important @xcite .    based on these nine t dwarfs found to date in the southern equatorial stripe ,",
    "we suggest that the eventual numbers of discovered dwarfs will not be able to reach the theoretical sky density of dh06 , even after correcting for different assumptions about the increased expected depth of the full ukidss imaging .",
    "the nine t dwarfs found in 136 square degrees suggest that by simple area scaling , approximately 264 dwarfs in the _ totaled _ early- to late - t classes may be found in 4000 square degrees of imaging to these depths ( searched depth of @xmath1 ) , approximately an order of magnitude less than the typical numbers expected by dh06 .",
    "the difference in quoted survey limits must also be taken into account to correctly compare the samples . however , after doing so , a significant shortfall remains .",
    "increasing the assumed searched depth from @xmath1 ( actually searched in this sample ) to @xmath18 ( the flux limit of dh06 ) , under an assumption of uniformly distributed objects , this would improve the limiting flux to @xmath19 the present value , the probed distance to @xmath20 , and therefore the searched spherical volume to @xmath21 the present value ",
    "606 early+late t dwarfs .",
    "however , this still represents an approximately @xmath22 deficiency compared to the average dh06 projections .",
    "in addition , if the expected vertical scale height for dwarfs were to differ from normal stars ( such as a more rapid falloff ) , this could decrease the discovered numbers .",
    "we note that while a future increase in survey @xmath12 depth would increase the certainty of selected candidates through higher @xmath23 detections , it would not increase the absolute numbers of discovered dwarfs as dramatically as the factor of @xmath24 suggested by @xcite , because the colors of t dwarfs are expected ( and selected ) to display @xmath25 . as a result ,",
    "in the current sample being searched to @xmath1 , the survey depth of @xmath13 has not been a limiting factor .",
    "similarly , for the dh06 survey depth assumption of @xmath18 ( which is corrected for above ) , the simultaneous @xmath26 depth would not be limiting , and therefore the difference in survey @xmath5 depth can only account for one - sixth to one - half of the large discrepancy between the discovered dwarfs versus the dh06 predicted sky density .",
    "this shortfall , if affirmed as the ukidss dwarf census grows , may imply that the actual imf / birthrate of early and late t dwarfs falls at the very low end of dh06 model scenarios , and that y dwarfs ( as defined by dh06 ) will be proportionally even more rare . the t8.5 dwarf ( j00340052 ) of warren et al .",
    "has an estimated @xmath16 of 650750@xmath27 but with spectral characteristics only slightly different from previously identified late - t dwarfs .",
    "y dwarfs with nh@xmath17 absorption features may thus be rarer even than the 25100 predicted by dh06 in the full ukidss las  as challenging to find as @xmath28 quasars .",
    "we have conducted a search for high - redshift quasars and the coldest brown dwarfs in @xmath29 square degrees of the ukidss dr1 in the southern equatorial stripe ( sdss stripe 82 ) .",
    "searching the combined ukidss and sdss databases , followed by dedicated imaging and spectroscopy , has yielded four newly discovered t dwarfs , three of which are spectroscopically identified and one is strongly inferred based on near - ir photometry and optical spectroscopy .",
    "these are in addition to the four t dwarfs discovered independently by collaborators and one sdss t dwarf previously known in this area .",
    "the four discovered dwarfs are among the faintest and coldest dwarfs found to date . from this ongoing search ,",
    "we expect approximately @xmath30 early+late t dwarfs may be found in the total 4000 square degrees of the final ukidss data . as deep optical data from sdss become available",
    ", this search will continue to seek fainter and cooler dwarf types , in hopes of the still elusive y dwarf class , and an ever increasing number of these once rare objects .",
