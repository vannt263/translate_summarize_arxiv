    "many quantum antiferromagnets have been recently reported , where strong quantum fluctuations destroy n@xmath12el order and stabilize a singlet ground state .",
    "such systems are characterized by a gap in their excitation spectrum . in gapped spin systems ,",
    "the ground states are immune to perturbations such as inter - chain interactions , up to a threshold value , above which there is a transition to a long - range - ordered ( lro ) state .",
    "external magnetic field has a somewhat similar effect . in low fields ,",
    "the singlet state is retained , and the magnetization remains at zero .",
    "higher fields close the gap in the excitation spectrum and also trigger long - range magnetic order that can be described as bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of triplons , magnetic excitations in a gapped quantum magnet .",
    "the bec phenomenon has been actively studied in several model spin-@xmath13 materials , such as tlcucl@xmath14 and bacusi@xmath15o@xmath16 representing three - dimensional ( 3d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) regimes of the bec , respectively.@xcite although the bec transition does not occur in one dimension , quasi-1d materials with finite interchain couplings offer interesting effects in the applied magnetic field , including the tomonaga - luttinger liquid at higher temperatures and the bec state at low temperatures.@xcite    the crystal structure of agvoaso@xmath2 . the vo@xmath17 octahedra form alternating chains running along crossing directions and are inter - connected by aso@xmath2 tetrahedra .",

    "[ fig1 ] contains one vanadium and one arsenic site .",
    "the vanadium atoms form distorted vo@xmath17 octahedra with v - o distances varying from 1.64 to 2.14   .",
    "the arsenic atoms form nearly regular aso@xmath2 tetrahedra with as - o distances of 1.69 - 1.71   .",
    "the chains are formed along the crystallographic @xmath23-axis via corner sharing of the vo@xmath17 octahedra , whereas the aso@xmath2 tetrahedra connect the neighboring chains into a 3d structure .",
    "magnetic susceptibility @xmath24 , high - field magnetization , electron spin resonance ( esr ) , and microscopic band structure calculations for agvoaso@xmath11 have been reported in ref .  .",
    "though the @xmath24 data show a broad maximum at around 20  k , a hall - mark of low - dimensionality , bulk magnetic susceptibility @xmath24 at low temperatures is dominated by a curie - like paramagnetic contributions of unknown origin .",
    "an alternating spin-@xmath1 chain model fit yields the exchange couplings @xmath25  k and @xmath26  k. the low - temperature magnetization curve corrected for the paramagnetic impurity contribution reveals that the intrinsic magnetization remains zero up to 10  t , which is the critical field ( @xmath27 ) of the gap closing .",
    "the magnetization saturates at @xmath28  t. from the value of @xmath27 , the spin gap was estimated to be @xmath29  k.@xcite    the microscopic band structure calculations predict that alternating spin chains run along the [ 110 ] and [ 1@xmath300 ] directions , whereas interchain couplings are frustrated .",
    "surprisingly , the structural chains were found to be not representing the direction of the leading exchange interactions , because no overlap between the @xmath31 orbital of v@xmath7 and @xmath32-orbital of the bridging oxygen atom is possible .",
    "stronger superexchange interactions were found to run perpendicular to the structural chains via aso@xmath2 tetrahedra .",
    "thus , each aso@xmath2 tetrahedra connects two vo@xmath17 octahedra in one chain and two more vo@xmath17 octahedra of another chain running perpendicular to the first one .",
    "given the fact that both @xmath33 t and @xmath34 t are feasible for present - day high - field facilities , agvoaso@xmath11 is an interesting model material for studying bec in a quasi-1d system .",
    "however , its further investigation is hampered by the low - temperature curie - like contribution that masks the putative spin gap .",
    "such a contribution may arise from the magnetic anisotropy,@xcite although it may also have a more trivial impurity origin .    in the following",
    ", we address the origin of this low - temperature contribution by @xmath0as nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) measurements .",
    "we show that the intrinsic magnetic susceptibility of agvoaso@xmath11 goes to zero at low temperatures , thus confirming the presence of a spin gap .",
    "nmr is a powerful microscopic tool to study the structural , static , and dynamic properties of frustrated spin systems .",
    "since the @xmath0as nucleus is inductively coupled to the magnetic spins , it is possible to extract information about the low - lying excitations of the v@xmath7 spins by measuring @xmath0as nmr spectra , nmr shift , and spin - lattice relaxation time . in the polycrystalline sample",
    ", the presence of extrinsic impurities and defect spins normally hinders the analysis of @xmath24 at low temperatures . in this context",
    ", the advantage of nmr is that the nmr line shift ( @xmath35 ) is a direct measure of the _ intrinsic _ spin susceptibility and is completely free from impurity contributions . for a random distribution of defect",
    "spins this paramagnetism broadens the nmr line but without contributing to the nmr shift .",
    "thus , one can precisely estimate the magnetic parameters such as the exchange couplings and the spin gap from analyzing @xmath3 instead of @xmath24 . our analysis of @xmath3 indeed confirms the alternating - spin - chain model with @xmath4  k , @xmath36 , and @xmath6  k. the exponential decrease of @xmath3 at low temperatures provides a direct evidence of a spin gap and suggests that the upturn in @xmath24 is extrinsic in nature",

    "the synthesis of polycrystalline agvoaso@xmath2 sample was done following the procedure reported in ref .  .",
    "the nmr experiments on @xmath0as nucleus ( nuclear spin @xmath38 and gyromagnetic ratio @xmath39/2@xmath40 = @xmath41  mhz / t ) were carried out using pulsed nmr techniques at a radio frequency ( @xmath42 ) of 49.5  mhz .",
    "the nmr spectra as a function of temperature @xmath43 were obtained by sweeping the magnetic field keeping the frequency ( @xmath44 ) fixed to 49.5  mhz .",

    "the position of the satellite lines depends on the angle @xmath64 between the magnetic field direction and the direction of the largest efg component @xmath65 . when quadrupole effects are considered to second order ( and for axial symmetry ) , the central line position ( in the absence of anisotropy ) also depends on @xmath64 and is given by the following equation:@xcite @xmath66(1 - \\cos^{2}\\theta)(9\\cos^{2}\\theta - 1),\\ ] ] where @xmath67 the larmor frequency . for a polycrystalline sample , the external field is oriented randomly and the spectrum is typically broad .",

    "furthermore , the nmr line shape remains almost unchanged with temperature except for the line broadening . for a simple paramagnet , the line width at half maximum",
    "is expected to increase in a curie - weiss manner with decreasing temperature .",
    "we indeed observed a systematic line broadening with lowering temperatures .",
    "the quadrupolar frequency was found to remain almost unaltered in the whole measured temperature range indicating no further structural deformation of the vo@xmath17 octahedra and hence rules out the possibility of any lattice distortion as was observed in case of spin - peierls transition in cugeo@xmath14.@xcite     temperature - dependent @xmath0as nmr shift @xmath35 as a function of temperature @xmath43 .",

    "in contrast , the exponential decrease observed in @xmath3 clearly proves that the low - temperature upturn in @xmath24 is extrinsic in nature .",
