    "to explain and reproduce the complex phenomena of road traffic , the dynamics of traffic flows are often described on @xmath0 strongly - linked particles ( vehicles ) under fluctuations @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "since the governing interaction forces or potentials can not be directly measured , the statistical distributions of particles are often investigated instead @xcite , @xcite .    among different statistical features ,",
    "the distributions of space - gaps / time - headways between these particles ( vehicles ) received consistent interests from various viewpoints . in transportation engineering , the corresponding investigation data are helpful not only in understanding the microscopic - level driving behaviors but also in estimating the macroscopic - level roadway capacities @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "numerous distribution models have been developed over the past 50 years to directly fit the empirical data . in some recent studies",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , some theoretical models were presented from various physical perspectives ( e.g. scatter theory and random matrix theory ) to explain why we can observe similar distributions even for different phases ( i.e. kerner s the free - flow , synchronized flow , and moving jam phases @xcite ) .    differently in this paper , another interpretation inspired by the well - known galton board is presented . a new car - following model based on this interpretation is also proposed to reproduce the observed traffic flow phenomena .",
    "the research purposes are twofold here : 1 ) previous physical interpretations focus on the steady - state macroscopic - level statistics ; while this method provides a microscopic - level dynamic explanation , which can also be used to simulation the transient - state statistics of inter - arrival and inter - departure vehicle queuing interactions .",
    "2 ) it is interesting that as a slightly modified extension of the classic car - following model , this new model can easily reproduce the observed time - headway distributions , which had been neglected by many previous approaches .",
    "based on several recent studies @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , we believe that log - normal distribution model is a simple yet effective model comparing to other ones , i.e. distribution models according to random - matrix theory @xcite , @xcite .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows the comparison results for the empirical , super - statistical on random matrix theory @xcite and log - normal distributions @xmath1 , where @xmath2 , @xmath3 denotes the sampled time headways .",
    "it is clear that log - normal distribution model leads to smaller fitting errors .",
    "moreover , log - normal distribution model can also be used to depict the distributions of time headways in transient - state flow .",
    "for instance , the departure headways ( which are usually defined as the times that elapse between consecutive vehicles when vehicles in a queue start crossing the stop line ) are shown to follow log - normal distributions in @xcite .",
    "noticing that the random matrix theory gives a soundable explanation for its corresponding distribution model , an interesting question naturally arises as : `` can we provide a physical interpretation of such log - normal distributions ? '' after comparing with the other dynamic processes that yield log - normal distribution @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , we think the outcomes of such distributions can be explained as follows .    in car - following process , the driver of the following vehicle will adjust his / her velocity from time to time to track the leading vehicle and meanwhile keep a safe distance between the leading vehicle and him / her . because the leading vehicle s movement is often unpredictable ( at least not fully predictable ) , the accelerating and braking action of the driver is often overdue .",
    "this persistent velocity adjusting process is somewhat like the process of the particles falling down a board and being deviated at decision points ( the tips of the triangular obstacles ) either left or right with equal probability , see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "if the deviation of the particle from one row to the next is a random additive process with possible values @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the normal distribution will be created by the board , which reflects the cumulative additive effects of the sequence of decision points .",
    "but if the deviation of the particle from one row to the next is a random multiplicative process with possible values @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the log - normal distribution will be generated .",
    "( a )    ( b )    it is obvious that drivers tend to take very careful acceleration when the spacing between the two vehicles is small and do not want to speed up at once after braking .",
    "thus , the deviation of the particle to the left is equivalent to the following vehicle s accelerating action , since the relative speed decrease slowly at this period ; while the deviation to the right is equivalent to the following vehicle s braking action , since the relative speed increase quickly at this period . from this view point ,",
    "the car - following process is similar to the particles falling in the log - normal type galton board . to verify this conjecture , a microscopic simulation model inspired by log - normal type galton board",
    "is proposed in the next section to reproduce the observed phenomena .",
    "in this section , it will be interesting to find that a car - following model incorporating galton board mechanism can be easily derived from a famous classic car - following model proposed in later 1950s @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the proposed model mainly depicts three states of a vehicle : 1 ) stopped , 2 ) starting - up , and 3 ) driving / braking states .",
    "more precisely , they can be described as follows .",
    "suppose @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the velocity and position of the @xmath10th vehicle ( follower ) at time @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "similarly , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the velocity and position of the @xmath14th vehicle ( leader ) at time @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath15 denotes the gap between the two vehicles at time @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath16 is the simulation time span .",
    "\\1 ) if @xmath17 , that is , the @xmath10th vehicle is fully stopped at time @xmath11 ; it will stay stopped in the next time interval @xmath18 and then enter the starting state since time @xmath19 .",
    "\\2 ) else if the @xmath10th vehicle is in the starting - up state at time @xmath11 , it will check its coming actions from the following three choices :",
    "2.a ) if @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the minimum stop distance .",
    "the @xmath10th vehicle will go back to stop state by letting @xmath22 without doing anything else ( that s , @xmath23 .",
    "2.b ) else if @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the limit of the staring - up velocity ; the vehicle is still in the starting - up state at time @xmath19 .",
    "thus , it will accelerate with the staring - up rate @xmath26 in the next time interval @xmath18 till time @xmath19 .",
    "2.c ) otherwise , the vehicle will switch to the driving / braking state since time @xmath11 and re - determine its action according to the updating rules set for the driving / braking state at time @xmath11 .",
    "\\3 ) otherwise , the vehicle is running in the driving / braking state .",
    "actually , the driving / braking state contains three modes : 3.a ) free - driving mode , 3.b ) braking model and 3.c ) following mode ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) , which can be represented in details as :    3.a ) if @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the maximum coupling distance ; the @xmath10th vehicle is in free - driving mode .",
    "it will try to approach the highest velocity as    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the maximum allowable acceleration rate . for simplicity , we choose @xmath31 second here .",
    "3.b ) else if @xmath32 / h$ ] , there exists a risk to collide , and @xmath10th vehicle is in braking mode .",
    "it will try to stop as quickly as possible    @xmath33    where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are positive constants denoting the minimum safety gap , deceleration time and braking decelerating rate , respectively .",
    "3.c ) otherwise , the @xmath10th vehicle is in the following mode .",
    "we have the following two - step updating rules as    @xmath37    @xmath38    where @xmath39 denotes the length of the @xmath10th vehicle .",
    "@xmath40 is the maximum allowable velocity . @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the maximum allowable car - following ac / deceleration rates .",
    "the @xmath43 , @xmath44 functions are added to guarantee that the velocity and ac / decelerating rates are within the limits .",
    "@xmath45 is a positive constant to be determined according to investigation data .",
    "eq.([equ:3])-([equ:4 ] ) characterize the simulated time headways to follow the log - normal distributions .",
    "a brief explanation of this mechanism is provided in the appendix .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath46 together with @xmath47 , since drivers tend to keep a close spacing .",
    "we can see that eq.([equ:3])-([equ:4 ] ) naturally incorporate the frequently - used randomly - slow - down features of driving behaviors .",
    "\\4 ) finally , the position of vehicle is updated as    @xmath48    to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model , a specialized form is used to reproduce the complex phenomena of freeway traffic flows .",
    "particularly , we have all the vehicles have the same length as @xmath49 m and @xmath50s .",
    "other parameters are set as @xmath51 m/s , @xmath52m / s@xmath53 , @xmath54 m , @xmath55 m , @xmath56 m/s , @xmath57 m/s , @xmath58 m/s , @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath61 m , @xmath62s , @xmath63m / s@xmath53 .",
    "[ fig:4 ] shows the corresponding distributions of the simulated time headways within different velocity ranges .",
    "the log - normal distribution model passes the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s)hypothesis test .",
    "this proves that the new model yields the log - normal type time - headway distribution as observed ; while many previous models yield symmetric distributions , i.e. fig .",
    "7 of @xcite .",
    "moreover , as the velocity of the vehicle increases , the mean time headways of such log - normal type distributions will approach the saturation headway .",
    "this fits the observations @xcite , @xcite , too .",
    "( a )    ( b )    fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] shows the corresponding distributions of the simulated space gaps under different traffic pressures .",
    "as the traffic flow density ( occupancy ) increases , the distribution of space gaps will become more concentrated , which is in accordance with the practical observations ( see the un - scaled distributions shown in fig .",
    "3a in @xcite for comparison ) .",
    "moreover , the shape of the un - scaled simulated gap distributions look similar to the empirical data and also the scaled distributions predicted by using random matrix theory ( see that shown in fig .  1 in @xcite for comparison ) .",

    ", @xmath66 denotes the length of the closed single - lane system , which is @xmath67 m .",
    "it can be found that the local measurements in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] also discriminate kerner s three - phase flows : the free - flow regime contains only a few data points on a line ; the synchronized regime is formulated by widely scatters of the data points ; and jammed regimes contains the data points corresponding to kerner s line @xmath68 .",

    "[ fig:7 ] shows three typical complex phenomena reproduced by using the proposed model : ( a ) the oscillation in traffic flow ; ( b ) the wide moving jam ; and ( c ) the stop - and - go waves .",
