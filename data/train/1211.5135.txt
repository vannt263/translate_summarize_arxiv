    "there are certain rotating shear flows which are rayleigh stable but experimental / observational data argue them to be turbulent . in absence of magnetic coupling , such flows are stable under linear perturbation . what drives their instability and then turbulence in absence of linearly unstable modes ? in order to understand a plausible route to hydrodynamic turbulence in such flows , a series of papers was published by different independent groups @xcite .",
    "bypass mechanism \" @xcite , those papers showed that such flows exhibit large transient energy growth of linear perturbation .",
    "it was argued earlier that indeed the large transient energy growth is responsible for subcritical transition to turbulence in plane couette flow and plane poiseuille flow , as seen in laboratory @xcite . in",
    "such flows the transient growth increases with increasing reynolds number ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "for example , in plane couette flow , the maximum transient growth scales as @xmath5 .",
    "however , the situation changes drastically when rotational effects come into the picture .",
    "the coriolis force is the main culprit behind this change .",
    "it was shown earlier @xcite that rate of the increase of transient growth in two - dimensional ( insignificant vertical scale height ) linearized rotating shear flows with keplerian angular velocity ( @xmath0 ) profile ( @xmath6 ; @xmath2 being the radial coordinate of the flow ) decreases much compared to that in plane couette flows , when maximum growth scales as @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , in three dimensions ( with finite height ) , such transient growth in keplerian flows is insignificant , independent of viscosity , to generate any instability and turbulence .",
    "but the three - dimensional keplerian flow is an important natural flow , which exists in several astrophysical contexts .",
    "interestingly , while some authors @xcite , based on the prototype experiment consisting of fluid confined between two corotating cylinders , reported the rayleigh stable rotating shear flows , similar to that of a keplerian disk , laminar , some other @xcite found it turbulent .",
    "however , the results from direct numerical simulations @xcite argue that laboratory flows are indeed hydrodynamically unstable and should become turbulent at low reynolds numbers .",
    "but the last author @xcite and the present authors @xcite also showed / argued that the experiments are compromised by undesired effects due to the finite length of the cylinders . note that some ( effective ) nonlinear theory @xcite revealing large energy growth of perturbation ( even of finite amplitude ) argues for plausible routes to turbulence in three dimensions . hence , the real challenge is to uncover the mystery of mismatch between theory and observation under linear theory , in absence of a finite amplitude of perturbation .",
    "as argued earlier @xcite that in three dimensions , one requires to invoke extra physics , e.g. external or self - generated noise etc . , to reveal large energy growth or even instability in the system .",
    "it is needless to mention that the real flows must be three - dimensional , e.g. an astrophysical accretion disk must have a thickness , however small may be , and hence rotation plays a significant role to determine the dynamics of the flow .",
    "the aim of the present work is to investigate the amplification of linear perturbations which may eventually lead to hydrodynamic instability and then plausible turbulence in certain rotating shear flows supplemented by stochastic fluctuations in three dimensions .",
    "there is a long term association of growing , unstable modes generated by perturbed flows with statistical physics .",
    "the flow fields perturbed either at the boundary or through external forcing have been shown to produce emergent instabilities @xcite , altering the scaling structure of the systems .",
    "it was shown by forster , nelson and stephen @xcite that in the long time , large distance asymptotic limit , large non - equilibrium fluctuations in unbounded flows decouple to stabilize the flow .",
    "the authors also studied the critical dimension beyond which fluctuations get redundant .",
    "however below that dimension , all the brownian oscillations perturb the flow in the equilibrium limit . in a follow - up work by de dominicis and martin @xcite , a further generalization of such ` forced navier - stokes flows '",
    "was provided incorporating a range of possibilities for the perturbing random forces which is correlated with the kolmogorov spectrum @xcite to redefine the scaling laws in the presence of such stochastic components .",
    "later on , the focus was on studying topical variations in the transport properties of fluids under stochastic perturbations @xcite .",
    "these works were the precursor to the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) model @xcite which studied a differential variant of the burger field to illumine fundamental hydrodynamic instabilities related to the intermittency spectrum @xcite .",
    "the kpz model also sheds light on varieties of non - equilibrium phenomena , including fluid flows , bacterial growth , paper burning front , etc .",
    "( see , @xcite ) .",
    "all such results were later encapsulated in another illustrative work by medina , kardar , hwa and zhang @xcite where the effects of varying spatio - temporal correlations were studied on the burger equation ( which is a one - dimensional variant of the navier - stokes equation ) .",
    "it also showed for the first time that the statistical field theory could be a legitimate consort of fluid mechanics such that local instabilities seen in fluid flows could often be identified as non - trivial infra - red divergences .",
    "all the studies , however , were restricted mostly to trivial / periodic and open / absorbing boundary conditions .",
    "chattopadhyay & bhattacharjee @xcite applied the randomly stirred model of navier - stokes flows constrained by geometry in a flow involving a three - dimensional _ bounded _ incompressible fluid perturbed by boundary layer shear . in that work , they considered two relatively shearing flat plates with a layer of fluid sandwiched in between .",
    "the effect of the constrained flow is implemented through the stochasticity structure function , which ensures that the symmetry is violated through noise autocorrelation function into the problem .",
    "note that the geometry could also be changed over to rotating co - axial cylinders @xcite for externally impressed shearing forces , essentially bearing the same qualitative imprint .",
    "this problem , known as boundary layer turbulence , has recently been revisited experimentally in laboratory , by generating shear in the flow through a raft of blowing air @xcite .",
    "a numerical simulation governing large eddy also reveals same experimentally observed non - inertial effects @xcite .",
    "note in a related context that astrophysical observed data indeed argued for the signature of chaos in rotating shear flows , more precisely accretion flows @xcite , which further supports infall of matter towards black holes @xcite and neutron stars @xcite due to turbulent viscosity .    in the present study , we implement the ideas of statistical physics discussed above to rotating shear flows in order to obtain the correlation energy growth of fluctuation / perturbation and underlying scaling properties .",
    "in the next section , we discuss the equations describing the stochastically forced perturbed flows which are to be solved for the present purpose .",
    "subsequently , in  3 we investigate the temporal and spatial correlations of perturbation in detail , in order to understand the plausible instability in the flows .",
    "finally , we summarize the results with conclusions in  4 .",
    "as our specific interest lies in hydrodynamic instability and turbulence in presence of stochastic noise , we straight away recall the orr - sommerfeld and squire equations in presence of the coriolis force @xcite , but supplemented by stochastic noise .",
    "they are established by eliminating pressure from the linearized navier - stokes equation with background plane shear @xmath8 neglecting magnetic coupling in presence of angular velocity @xmath9 in a small section of the incompressible flow .",
    "hence , the underlying equations are nothing but the linearized set of hydrodynamic equations combining with the equation of continuity in local cartesian coordinates ( @xmath10 ) at an arbitrary time @xmath11 ( see , e.g. , @xcite for detailed description of the choice of coordinate in a small section ) given by @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 represent respectively @xmath15components of velocity and vorticity perturbation , @xmath4 is the reynolds number , @xmath16 are the components of noise arising in the linearized system due to stochastic perturbation such that @xmath17 . note that equations ( [ orrv ] ) and ( [ zeta ] ) describe perturbations in a small section of an accretion flow which could be expressed in local cartesian coordinates .",
    "the long time , large distance behavior of the velocity correlations are encapsulated in @xmath18 which is a structure pioneered by forster , nelson and stephen @xcite . in the fourier transformed space ,",
    "the specific structure of the correlation function @xmath19 depends on the regime under consideration .",
    "it can be shown for all ( non - linear ) non - inertial flows @xcite that @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the spatial dimension , without vertex correction and @xmath22 with @xmath23 , in presence of vertex correction .",
    "note , however , that @xmath18 is constant for white noise .",
    "we now focus onto the narrow gap limit which otherwise leads to an approximation @xmath24 , when @xmath25 being the ( narrow ) size of the shearing box in the @xmath26-direction .",
    "the appropriate choice of a sharing box has already been described by the previous authors ; see , e.g. @xcite , which we do not repeat here again . in brief , in a local analysis one considers a small radially confined region of the accretion flow , while the azimuthal confinement is imposed by a periodic boundary condition .",
    "this effectively gives rise to a shearing cartesian box for geometrically thin flows .",
    "we further choose a very small @xmath25 so that we are essentially interested in an orbit .",
    "this is in the same spirit as of the celebrated work by balbus & hawley @xcite who initiated the existence of magneto - rotational - instability ( mri ) with axisymmetric perturbation .",
    "one of the motivations behind it is as follows .",
    "presence of turbulence in shearing astrophysical accretion disks is mandatory to generate viscosity therein .",
    "it is only the viscosity which helps in transporting the energy - momentum from an outer orbit to an inner orbit leading to the inspiral of matter , giving rise to a differential rotating ( shearing ) structure of accretion disks . as the aim is to address the origin of such viscosity ( which can not be of molecular ) for rotating shear flows , choosing @xmath26 to be fixed justified .",
    "hence , in the above discussed framework , we can resort to a fourier series expansion of @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 as @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively represent the wave - vector and angular frequency of perturbation , and substituting them into equations ( [ orrv ] ) and ( [ zeta ] ) we obtain @xmath33 where @xmath34 @xmath35 when @xmath36 ; @xmath37 , are the components of noise in @xmath38 space , @xmath39 .",
    "we now look at the spatio - temporal autocorrelations of the flow fields @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xcite . for the present purpose",
    ", the magnitudes and gradients ( scalings ) of these autocorrelation functions of perturbations would plausibly indicate noise induced instability which could lead to turbulence in rotating shear flows .",
    "assuming @xmath40 , we obtain the temporal correlations of velocity , vorticity and gradient of velocity given below as @xmath41 where @xmath42 be the time at which the correlations to be measured . now using equations ( [ mat1 ] ) , ( [ mat2 ] ) , ( [ am ] ) and ( [ velzetdercor ] ) @xmath43/[-4(-2+q)^2r_e^4k_z^4\\\\ \\nonumber & & + 4r_e^2q^2(-2+q)k^2k_z^2(k^4-(r_e\\omega+lr_ek_y)^2)\\\\ & & -k^4q^4(k^4+(r_e\\omega+lr_ek_y)^2)^2 ] .",

    "our one of the major interests is to determine the scaling laws , this restriction would not matter .",
    "however , this is equivalent to a special choice of initial perturbation which will affect the magnitude of the correlations .",
    "we now perform the @xmath32-integration by computing the poles of the kernel given by @xmath45    by summing up the residues at the appropriate poles in presence of white noise , we evaluate the magnitude of frequency part of the integration given by @xmath46 , \\\\ & & { \\rm where } \\\\ \\nonumber & & a = \\sqrt{2\\tilde{x}+\\sqrt{4\\tilde{x}^2+\\tilde{y}^2}},\\,\\ b = \\sqrt{\\tilde{x}+\\sqrt{4\\tilde{x}^2+\\tilde{y}^2}},\\\\   \\nonumber & & \\tilde{x } = -[\\frac{k^4}{r_e^2}+\\frac{2}{3}(\\frac{(2-q)}{q^2})]\\tau^2,\\,\\    \\tilde{y } = \\frac{2}{3}\\sqrt{6(2-q)}(\\frac{k^2}{q r_e})\\tau^2 , \\\\",

    "@xcite ) always .",
    "later , we will discuss the cases with @xmath56 what effectively does not alter our results .      at a large @xmath4 ( @xmath57 ) @xmath58 reduces to    @xmath59    [ rotscal ]    hence",
    ", the correlation effectively appears independent of @xmath60 at small and large @xmath42 , at a large @xmath4 in particular .",
    "however , at an intermediate @xmath42 , correlation diverges at @xmath61  when the background specific angular momentum is conserved . then with the decrease of @xmath60 , due to appearance of fluctuation due to rotational / coriolis effects with nonzero epicyclic frequency ( see ,",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion ) , correlation decreases ( see fig .",
    "[ tempr1e4 ] also ) . however , the correlation is effectively controlled by the dynamics of the flow , independent of viscosity .    for completeness",
    "we also calculate the correlation for nonrotating flows , given by    @xmath62    [ nonrotscal ]    hence , unless @xmath42 is very small at a finite @xmath4 , correlation depends on @xmath4  quite an opposite trend of the rotating cases . interestingly in absence of pressure , @xmath63 as @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , the rotation and pressure both create significant impact in the behavior in the flow such that the scaling behavior changes .",
    "once @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( when @xmath68}^2 > | \\sim     @xmath69 ) are known , the evolution of perturbation energy growth @xmath70 $ ] can be computed .",
    "however , by simple calculation of scaling law , it can be shown that each of the terms in @xmath71 scales with @xmath42 identically and hence the scaling behavior of @xmath71 is same as that of @xmath72 apart from a constant factor .    , when @xmath73 ( solid line ) , @xmath74 ( dashed line ) , @xmath75 ( dotted line ) , @xmath76 ( dotdashed line ) and flow is non - rotating ( thick line ) . ]    0.3 in , when @xmath77 ( solid line ) , @xmath78 ( dashed line ) and @xmath79 ( dotted line ) . , title=\"fig : \" ] 0.5 cm    , except for non - rotating flow . , title=\"fig : \" ] 0.5 cm      figure [ tempr1e4 ] shows that with the decrease of @xmath60 , temporal correlation of velocity perturbation decreases as the fluctuation due to the presence of coriolis force increases . at small values of @xmath60 ( e.g. for @xmath80 ) , however , the coriolis fluctuation interacting with noise appears to be dominating in a way that the correlation reveals an oscillatory amplitude ( this is more clear from fig .",
    "[ tempq1p5 ] ) .",
    "hence in a few rotation time the correlation exceeds that of large @xmath60 , when it increases steadily in absence of dominant coriolis effect at large @xmath60 .",
    "however , in either of the regimes , temporal correlation of perturbation appears large enough in a few rotation time , which reveals nonlinearity in the system , presumably leading to instability . the correlation appears to be increasing steadily for the nonrotating case , in absence of coriolis fluctuation , similar to that for @xmath61 .",
    "thus the interesting outcome here is the following .",
    "the coriolis fluctuations along with a steady effect of noise lead to a larger @xmath72 for a smaller @xmath60 than that of a larger @xmath60 in a few rotation time , as is also indicated by equation ( [ rotscal ] ) . note that an important physical quantity in this context is the rotation time of the flow . in a few rotation time , noise and the coriolis fluctuation together bring in a large @xmath72 and hence perturbation energy ( prone to a smaller @xmath60 , such as @xmath74 ) , which presumably could lead to a transition to turbulence .",
    "therefore , the presence of noise makes the coriolis effect active to generate instability , which were otherwise acting as the agents hindering the perturbation effects ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , leading to a faster rate of perturbation energy growth into the system .",
    "figure [ tempq1p5 ] shows that for @xmath81 , the correlation tends to become independent of @xmath4 .",
    "this is because with decreasing @xmath60 , the epicyclic frequency ( @xmath82 ) becomes larger bringing lots of fluctuation in the flow , which makes the flow limited by the dynamics itself but not by the viscosity . in absence of noise ,",
    "perturbation energy growth ( and hence @xmath72 ) is very small , as shown previously @xcite , for @xmath81 , particularly in three dimensions .",
    "note , however , that at a small / moderate @xmath4 , epicyclic fluctuations work with noise in such a way that @xmath72 at small @xmath42 appears smaller than that of larger @xmath4 ( see @xmath83 case in fig .",
    "[ tempq1p5 ] ) due to the harmonic nature of fluctuations .",
    "this effectively argues that the correlation saturates only with the increase of @xmath4 for @xmath81 .",
    "figure [ tempnorot ] shows that @xmath72 for a nonrotating flow at @xmath83 appears larger at large @xmath42 compared to that at larger values of @xmath4 .",
    "this is due to the effect of noise , which would have been suppressed at larger @xmath4 .",
    "this is also clearly understood from the analytical scaling laws given by equation ( [ nonrotscal ] ) .",
    "note that , a very large @xmath4 along with a large @xmath42 diminishes fluctuations in the flow leading to a linear perturbation growth with @xmath4 , as shown in equation ( [ norotscalc ] ) .    comparing rotating and non - rotating cases",
    ", it can be further inferred that the noise suppresses the viscous effects in the rotating flow making it independent of @xmath4 in the regime of smaller @xmath42 , as also shown by equation ( [ rotscalb ] ) .",
    "however , the optimum perturbation of a flow might reveal the correlation varying with @xmath4 , and the above inferences are valid for a fixed perturbation , considered for all the present cases .",
    "note that in absence of noise , perturbation energy growth ( and hence @xmath72 ) in all the above rotating cases , essentially for @xmath81 , is very small , as shown previously @xcite , particularly in three dimensions .",
    "however , the effects of noise bring a steady growth in the perturbation top of the coriolis fluctuations . a remarkable feature in the scaling nature of all these correlations , atleast for asymptotic @xmath42 ( see , e.g. , equations ( [ rotscalb ] ) and ( [ rotscalc ] ) ) , is their independence of @xmath60 ( background angular velocity profile )  a trait identified in statistical physics literature as _ universality_. all these flows , with identical overall perturbation energy growth exponents @xcite in asymptotic limits of @xmath42 ( and also @xmath4 ) , but generally with varying energy dissipation amplitudes , indicate a specific universality class for them .      here",
    "also we assume @xmath84 like temporal correlation and obtain spatial correlations of velocity , vorticity and gradient of velocity , given below as @xmath85 where @xmath86 be the position where the correlations to be measured .",
    "now using equations ( [ mat1 ] ) , ( [ mat2 ] ) , ( [ am ] ) and ( [ velzetdercor2 ] ) , the velocity correlation perturbation @xmath87 is explicitly given by    @xmath88/ [ 4 ( 2-q)^2 r_e^4 k_z^4 + \\\\ \\nonumber & & 4 r_e^2 q^2 ( 2-q ) k^2 k_z^2 ( k^4-(r_e \\omega + lr_e k_y)^2 )   + k^4 q^4 ( k^4+\\\\ \\nonumber & & { ( r_e \\omega + lr_e k_y)}^2)^2 ] \\\\ \\nonumber & & = 2\\pi^2~\\int_{k_0}^{k_m}~dk~k^2~j_0(kr)~\\int d\\omega~[2d_1 q^4 r_e^2 ( k^4 + ( r_e   \\omega + lr_e k_y)^2)\\\\ \\nonumber   & & + 8d_2 q^2 r_e^4 k_z^2]/[4 ( 2-q)^2 r_e^4 k_z^4 + 4 r_e^2 q^2 ( 2-q ) k^2 k_z^2 ( k^4-(r_e \\\\ & & \\omega + lr_e k_y)^2 ) + k^4 q^4 ( k^4+(r_e \\omega + lr k_y)^2)^2 ] , \\label{spacecorr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath89 is the zeroth - order bessel function .",
    "similarly , one can obtain @xmath90 and @xmath91 explicitly , when the poles in equation ( [ spacecorr ] ) are exactly the same as that given by equation ( [ poles ] ) . here",
    "also we stick to the simplifying assumption @xmath44 .    now following the same procedure",
    "as applied for the correlation of temporal velocity perturbation , we obtain the correlation of spatial velocity perturbation @xmath87 given by @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the magnitude of the part arising from frequency integration .      at large @xmath2 and @xmath4 ( which is a natural / astrophysical scenario ) ,",
    "the flows with all @xmath60 reveal identical scaling of correlation with @xmath2 given by @xmath94 which is independent of @xmath4 .",
    "note that at a finite @xmath2 , @xmath95 .",

    " bypass method \" in two dimensions @xcite , it was shown that @xcite extra physics , e.g. elliptical vortex effects , has to be invoked for such instabilities to occur in three dimensions . however , later theories showing instabilities are effectively based on nonlinear theory .",
    "therefore , the present work addresses the _ large three - dimensional hydrodynamic energy growth of linear perturbation _ for the first time , in such rotating flows , to best of our knowledge , which presumably leads to instability and subsequent turbulence in such flows . only requirement here is to have the presence of stochastic noise in the system , which is quite obvious in natural flows like astrophysical accretion disks .",
    "indeed , to best of our knowledge , no one so far has addressed the effects of stochastic noise in such rotating flows .",
    "interestingly , the flows with velocity profile @xmath9 , with @xmath81 , exhibiting identical overall growth exponents ( but may not be identical energy dissipation amplitudes ) , indicate a specific universality class . at large @xmath2",
    ", they also reveal identical roughness exponents .",
    "thus the properties of temporal and spatial correlations together indicate the rayleigh stable rotating shear flows to follow a single universality class .",
    "let us end by clarifying suitability of astrophysical application of our results which is based on incompressible assumption .",
    "if the wavelength of the velocity perturbations is much shorter than the sound horizon for the time of interest ( e.g. infall time of matter ) , then the density perturbations ( i.e. sound waves ) reach equilibrium early on , exhibiting effectively uniform density during the timescale of interest . for a geometrically thin astrophysical accretion disk around a gravitating mass ,",
    "the vertical half - thickness of the disk ( @xmath117 ) is comparable to the sound horizon corresponding to one disk rotation time @xcite such that @xmath118 .",
    "therefore , as described in previous work @xcite , for processes taking longer than one rotation time , wavelengths shorter than the disk thickness can be approximately treated as incompressible . a detailed astrophysical application of the present work has been reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the authors would like to thank rahul pandit for discussion .",
    "thanks are also due to the referees for carefully , thorough reading the paper and various suggestions which have helped to improve the presentation of the work .",
    "this work is partly supported by a project , grant no . isro / res/2/367/10 - 11 , funded by isro , india .",
    "let us now establish the linearized navier - stokes equation in presence of background plane shear @xmath8 without neglecting magnetic coupling with a background magnetic field @xmath119 , when @xmath120 being a constant , in presence of angular velocity @xmath9 in a small section of the incompressible flow .",
    "hence , the underlying equations are nothing but the linearized set of hydromagnetic equations including the equations of induction in local cartesian coordinates ( see , e.g. , @xcite for detailed description of the choice of coordinate in a small section ) given by @xmath121 @xmath122 @xmath123 @xmath124 @xmath125 @xmath126 when the vectors for velocity and magnetic field perturbations are @xmath127 and @xmath128 respectively , @xmath4 and @xmath129 are the hydrodynamic and magnetic reynolds numbers respectively , @xmath130 is the total pressure perturbation ( including that due to the magnetic field ) . above equations are supplemented by the conditions for incompressibility and no magnetic charge , given by @xmath131 @xmath132 now by taking partial derivatives with respect to @xmath10 respectively to both the sides of equations ( [ u ] ) , ( [ v ] ) , ( [ w ] ) and adding them up we obtain @xmath133 now taking @xmath134 to equation ( [ u ] ) , using equation ( [ delp ] ) and defining @xmath26-component of vorticity @xmath135 , we obtain @xmath136 also by taking partial derivatives with respect to @xmath26 and @xmath137 respectively to both the sides of equations ( [ v ] ) , ( [ u ] ) respectively , subtracting one from other and defining @xmath138 , we obtain @xmath139 furthermore , by taking partial derivatives with respect to @xmath137 and @xmath140 respectively to both the sides of equations ( [ bz ] ) and ( [ by ] ) and subtracting one from other , we obtain @xmath141 the equations ( [ orr ] ) , ( [ orr2 ] ) , ( [ bx ] ) and ( [ bzet ] ) describe the set of magnetized version of the orr - sommerfeld and squire equations in presence of the coriolis force , for the background magnetic field described above and linear shear .",
    "to best of our knowledge , this set of equations has not been reported in the existing literature so far .",

    "<S> such flows are rayleigh stable , but must be turbulent in order to explain observed data . such a mismatch between the linear theory and observations / experiments is more severe when any hydromagnetic / magnetohydrodynamic instability and then the corresponding turbulence therein is ruled out . the present work explores the effect of stochastic noise on such hydrodynamic flows . </S>",
    "<S> we essentially concentrate on a small section of such a flow which is nothing but a plane shear flow supplemented by the coriolis effect . </S>",
    "<S> this also mimics a small section of an astrophysical accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that such stochastically driven flows exhibit large temporal and spatial correlations of perturbation velocities , and hence large energy dissipations of perturbation , which presumably generate instability . </S>",
    "<S> a range of angular velocity ( @xmath0 ) profiles of background flow , starting from that of constant specific angular momentum ( @xmath1 ; @xmath2 being the radial coordinate ) to that of constant circular velocity ( @xmath3 ) , is explored . </S>",
    "<S> however , all the background angular velocities exhibit identical growth and roughness exponents of perturbations , revealing a unique universality class for the stochastically forced hydrodynamics of rotating shear flows . </S>",
    "<S> this work , to the best of our knowledge , is the first attempt to understand origin of instability and turbulence in the three - dimensional rayleigh stable rotating shear flows by introducing additive noise to the underlying linearized governing equations . </S>",
