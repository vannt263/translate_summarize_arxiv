    "how galaxy properties are affected by the environment they reside in remains one of the unsolved puzzles of galaxy formation .",
    "the galaxy population in clusters has been observed to have different properties from that in the field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that this growth of large scale structure is accompanied by a transformation in galaxy properties .",
    "however , it is still an open question as to exactly what mechanisms are responsible for this difference ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "clues might come from the outskirt regions of clusters , because that is where field and groups of galaxies are accreting onto clusters , especially along filamentary structures that are seen in simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "groups in the outskirts are particularly interesting ; a recent study by @xcite , using a semi - analytic model , shows that a large fraction of galaxies that accrete onto clusters are in groups ( but see @xcite ) , and they might have been pre - processed in the group environment before they fall into clusters @xcite . however , these groups are likely to be different from isolated groups in the field , due to their earlier formation time @xcite and the tidal fields from the large - scale structure around clusters @xcite",
    ". therefore , closer examination of groups and filamentary structures in the outskirts of clusters , and a comparison with isolated groups in the field , may provide important clues to how the cluster environment affects the properties of galaxies .",
    "we have started an extensive spectroscopic campaign on two contrasting clusters at intermediate redshift , focusing on groups in the outskirt regions out to @xmath10mpc .",
    "the ultimate goal is to put strong constraints on the effect of the environments by comparing properties of groups in the infall regions with those of isolated groups , and with galaxy formation models . in this work , as the first paper of a series , we present results from a pilot study on the dynamics and large - scale structure of one of the clusters , rx j1347 - 1145 ( @xmath11=0.451 ) .",
    "rx j1347 - 1145 is the most x - ray luminous cluster in the rosat all - sky survey ( rass , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and has been the subject of intense study , through spectroscopic @xcite , x - ray @xcite , lensing @xcite , and sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect @xcite analyses .",
    "the centre of the cluster was initially thought to be dynamically relaxed . although there are two very bright galaxies near the centre ( usually referred to as the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) and the second bcg ) , they are only 18 arcsec ( @xmath12 0.1mpc ) apart in the plane of sky , and @xmath13 km / s in velocity .",
    "however , a discrepancy between the relatively low mass measured dynamically by @xcite , compared with x - ray and weak lensing measurements , led to the suggestion that the cluster is actually undergoing a major merger .",
    "this hypothesis has received support recently from the discovery of shocked gas in the centre of the cluster @xcite .",
    "most of the previous work is on the central region of the cluster ; in this paper , we focus on the dynamics and the large - scale structure of this cluster , using imaging data obtained with cfht and spectroscopic data obtained with the magellan telescope .",
    "we describe the data in  [ dat ] . in ",
    "[ res ] , we present the photometric and spectroscopic analysis on the large - scale structure , and the detection of another massive cluster , rxj1347-sw , @xmath9 mpc from the cluster centre .",
    "we also present mass estimates of the two clusters through dynamical methods and weak lensing analysis . in  [ dis ]",
    "we compare our mass estimates of the main cluster with those in the literature , and discuss the possible filamentary connection between the main cluster and rxj1347-sw using simulations .",
    "our findings are summarized in  [ sum ] .    throughout this paper , we assume a cosmology with @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16=70 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 .",
    "all magnitudes are in the ab system .",
    "deep @xmath17 band images of the cluster over a 1 square degree field were obtained using megaprime on the cfht in semester 05a ( proposals 05ac10 and 05ac12 ) , with total exposure times of 4200 s in @xmath18 , 7200 s in @xmath19 , 1600 s in @xmath20 , and 3150 s in @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath21 band data will not be mentioned further , because they are not relevant for the work presented here . in each filter , images from single exposures are co - added using swarp v2.16.0 @xcite and photometry is performed using sextractor v2.4.4 @xcite , with the camera run zero point .",
    "the latter quantity is provided by elixir , and is extracted from the landoldt field observed under photometric conditions every night . since our science data were not taken under photometric conditions , a zero point offset calculated from a short exposure taken under photometric conditions is applied .",
    "the typical seeing is @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 in @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 band respectively .",
    "colours are measured using magnitudes within a fixed aperture of diameter 4.7 arcsec , which is much larger than the seeing difference in different filters .",
    "the magnitude measured within the kron radius ( @xmath25 ) is considered as the total magnitude for each object .",
    "although crowding and blending of objects affects the photometry for about ten percent of the galaxies in our sample , we have checked that none of the results presented here are sensitive to this .",
    "star - galaxy separation is based on the stellar locus defined by the half - light radius as a function of total magnitude , in combination with the sextractor parameter , @xmath26 .",
    "objects with @xmath27 in the @xmath18 band , and not on the stellar locus , are considered galaxies .",
    "the completeness limit for galaxies is @xmath120.8 mag brighter than the @xmath28 limit for point sources @xcite ; therefore , the completeness limit for galaxies in our catalog in the three bands that are relevant in this work is estimated to be @xmath29 mag , @xmath30 mag , and @xmath31 23.2 mag .            in this section ,",
    "we first describe our spectroscopic observation at the four pointings ( shown in figure [ sig ] ) that are chosen based on the large - scale structure traced by red - sequence galaxies , which will be described in  [ photst ] .    to make the survey more efficient",
    ", we use the combination of @xmath32 and @xmath33 colour information to eliminate obvious higher redshift galaxies ( see figure 6 in @xcite for more details ) .",
    "moreover , we select galaxies with @xmath34 mag .",
    "this ensures that for objects of interest here ( @xmath35 ) our sample is complete in each band , and the colour measurement is reliable .",
    "we make sure our targets are not colour biased ; as can be seen in appendix [ cp ] , the completeness in each pointing for the red and blue populations separately is similar , at @xmath36 per cent .",
    "spectra were obtained using the low dispersion survey spectrograph 3 ( ldss3 ) on the 6.5 meter clay telescope over the nights from 2008 april 28th to may 1st .",
    "the pointing positions are indicated in figure [ sig ] , each with a fov of 8.3 arcmin in diameter ( corresponding to r=@xmath37 mpc at the redshift of the cluster ) .",
    "the vr filter and medium red grism were used , which covers the wavelength range 5000   to 7200 . at the redshift of the cluster ,",
    "the important spectral features cah , cak , g - band , h@xmath38 and [ oii ] fall into this wavelength range .",
    "each pointing was observed with two masks , with an average of @xmath39 objects and 3x20 mins exposure , per mask , with slit width 1.2 arcsec , providing a spectral resolution of @xmath40 .",
    "the 2d raw spectra were first reduced using the cosmos2 software package , then 1d spectra were extracted and redshifts were determined using a modified version of @xmath41 kindly provided by renbin yan @xcite . in @xmath41 ,",
    "spectra are first compared with eigen - templates and the ten best - fitted redshifts are provided .",
    "we then visually examine the spectra and determine the best redshift .",
    "usually the first or second choice provided is a good fit .",
    "occasionally when none of the ten choices is a good match , we manually cross - correlate the spectral features and find the best - fit redshift .",
    "we consider redshifts determined from at least three supporting spectral features as secure .",
    "two example spectra , near the magnitude limit of our survey , are shown in appendix [ eg ] .",
    "for the 473 objects targeted , we obtained 400 secure redshifts , which are used in the analysis here .",
    "further details on the success rate , and the efficiency of our survey are presented in appendix [ cp ] . from the objects that have duplicate observations , the uncertainty on the redshift",
    "is estimated to be @xmath42 km s@xmath2 in the rest frame ( see appendix [ zun ] ) .",
    "we also compare the redshift of the common objects in our catalogue with that from @xcite , and find no systematic difference between these measurements ( appendix [ zun ] ) ; therefore , in the following analysis , we add the extra 34 redshifts from @xcite to our sample when applicable .",
    "in this section , we describe the large - scale structure traced by the red - sequence galaxies . again , only galaxies with @xmath34 mag are used , for reasons discussed in  [ obs ] . at the redshift of this cluster ( @xmath43 ) ,",
    "the @xmath44 colour brackets the 4000  break ; therefore we use this colour to identify red - sequence galaxies around this cluster , using a method based on the red - sequence cluster survey technique ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we define the red - sequence at the redshift of the cluster using known cluster members from @xcite that have @xmath44 colour measurement in our catalogue .",
    "given the small slope and the scatter of the colour , we choose to use a red - sequence that has zero slope with a half width of 0.15 mag . assuming the probability distribution of the colour of each galaxy is gaussian , with @xmath45 being the error on the colour measured from sextractor",
    ", we can calculate the probability of each galaxy belonging to the colour slice ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that the colour error from sextractor is likely to be underestimated is not important here , because the width of the colour slice used is much wider than the colour uncertainties .",
    "we consider galaxies with at least 10 per cent probability as red - sequence galaxies , and they are plotted as small circles in figure [ sig ] .",
    "our results here are insensitive to the details of how the red - sequence galaxies are selected .    using the background number counts measured from the canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls ) wide field 1",
    ", we can calculate the overdensity of red - sequence galaxies .",
    "we define the significance of the overdensity as the background - subtracted number of red - sequence galaxies divided by the r.m.s . of the background distribution .",
    "the contours of the significance map , smoothed over a region of radius @xmath46 mpc with a top hat function , are plotted in figure [ sig ] , starting from 2@xmath45 , with an interval of 1@xmath45 .",
    "the most significant peak ( @xmath47 ) is the main cluster ( the pointing  centre  ) .",
    "the number of red - sequence galaxies ( background subtracted ) within 0.5 mpc from the cluster centre , brighter than @xmath48 ( @xmath49 mag ) , denoted @xmath50 , is @xmath51 , where the uncertainty is estimated using poisson statistics .",
    "converting @xmath50 to @xmath52 according to figure 8 in @xcite , and using the scaling relation between @xmath52 and @xmath53 @xcite , we estimate the mass of the main cluster from its richness to be @xmath54 ; although we note the conversion from @xmath50 to @xmath52 for such a high richness system is extrapolated from lower richness systems .",
    "there is another prominent peak with a significance of @xmath55 , about 7 mpc ( projected ) away from the main cluster ( pointing `` sw '' ) .",
    "the @xmath50 for this system is @xmath56 , which corresponds to @xmath57 .",
    "this suggests this system is a cluster in its own right , and we will refer it as rxj1347-sw .",
    "the significance contours also reveal several clumps of overdensities in the infall region around the main cluster , and an elongated large - scale structure running from ne to sw , along a line connecting the main cluster and rxj1347-sw .",
    "four positions along this line are targeted for our spectroscopic follow - up with the magellan telescope as described in ",
    "( note the significant overdensity east of the pointing `` mid '' has been targeted with our on - going gemini program . )      in this section , we present the dynamical analysis of the above described photometrically identified structure , based on the redshifts obtained .      in figure [ z ] , the full redshift distribution of all galaxies is shown as the dotted open histogram .",
    "there are two main peaks in the full distribution : one corresponds to the centre of the main cluster , and the other corresponds to rxj1347-sw .",
    "we analyze these two clusters in detail first in this section , and examine the dynamics of the large - scale structure in the next section .",
    "the redshift distribution of galaxies within @xmath58 mpc from the main cluster centre is shown as the shaded histogram .",
    "the distribution is smooth in general ; there is an indication of two separate peaks , but the distribution is still consistent with being drawn from the single gaussian overplotted on the shaded histogram in figure [ z ] .",
    "in particular , a @xmath59 test shows that a subsample drawn from this single gaussian distribution would have a @xmath59 value as large as we observed about @xmath60 per cent of the time .",
    "the mean redshift we measure is @xmath61 , consistent with the previous measurement by @xcite .",
    "the dispersion we measure , using the bi - weight method of @xcite , with 3@xmath45 clipping applied , is @xmath62 , which corresponds to a rest - frame velocity dispersion of 1163@xmath63 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the errors are estimated using jackknife resampling @xcite . from now on",
    ", we refer to galaxies that are within 3 times the dispersion as members of the main cluster .",
    "the velocity dispersion we measure is higher than that of @xcite ( we discuss this more in  [ lit ] ) .    despite the consistency with a single gaussian",
    "there is an indication of two separate velocity peaks in the distribution .",
    "a @xmath59 test shows that , at the @xmath1230 per cent level , the distribution is consistent with a combination of two gaussian functions : one with @xmath64 and rest - frame velocity dispersion @xmath65 km / s , and the other with @xmath66 and @xmath67 km / s . in that case , the centre of the cluster would be composed of two separate components with much smaller masses , and a relative velocity of @xmath68 km s@xmath2 ; considerably larger than the @xmath13km / s difference between the two bcgs ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) .",
    "although statistically this model is not favoured over the single - population model , we can not rule out the possibility that there are two distinct dynamical components .",
    "we revisit this further in ",
    "[ mer ] when we consider both the spatial and velocity distribution of galaxies .",
    "the redshift distribution of rxj1347-sw ( pointing `` sw '' ) is shown as the open solid histogram in figure [ z ] .",
    "it is not significantly different from a gaussian distribution , with a mean redshift of @xmath71 , and dispersion of @xmath72 , or @xmath73 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we examine the dynamics of the large - scale structure by converting the redshift of each galaxy to a rest - frame velocity relative to the central redshift of the main cluster . in figure [ vr ]",
    "we show the velocity offset as a function of position projected along the line connecting the main cluster and rxj1347-sw .",
    "galaxies in the inner region of the cluster mainly occupy regions spanning from @xmath74 km s@xmath2 to 2000 km s@xmath2 , symmetrically , while rxj1347-sw is at @xmath75 km s@xmath2 from the main cluster .",
    "note that in velocity space , the region occupied by members of massive clusters resembles a trumpet shape , as expected in a spherical infall model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the dashed curves in figure [ vr ] indicate the boundary of the caustics for these two systems ( as will be discussed in  [ mdyn ] ) , derived analytically from equation ( 7 ) in @xcite assuming the two systems follow a nfw profile @xcite . in pointing `` east '' , on the other side of the main cluster away from rxj1347-sw ,",
    "there are almost no galaxies in the regions labelled `` a '' and `` b '' in figure [ vr ] around the cluster above the caustic curve . in comparison , there are @xmath10 galaxies occupying the region between the main cluster and rxj1347-sw , labelled `` c '' . given that our redshift completeness is about 50 per cent , we expect there are approximately twice as many @xmath76 galaxies ( @xmath77 ) within that region in total .",
    "note this is not a sampling bias , because the pointing `` east '' and `` mid '' are located symmetrically on two sides of the main cluster .",
    "also , the uncertainties on the redshift determination , or the position of the caustic curve , would not change the fact that there is an excess of galaxies between the main cluster and rxj1347-sw . in  [ simu ]",
    "we will use simulations to investigate whether these galaxies are physically residing in regions between the main cluster and rxj1347-sw , and thus suggest a possible structure connecting the two systems .      as described in ",
    "[ photst ] , we trace the large - scale structure around this cluster using red - sequence galaxies . we consider galaxies in the redshift range @xmath78 as associated with the structure , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the mean and dispersion of the redshift distribution of the main cluster , and @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the same for rxj1347-sw . in figure [ sig ] ,",
    "solid squares and crosses represent red and blue galaxies that are spectroscopically confirmed to be associated with the structure , respectively .",
    "the study by @xcite revealed a higher fraction of blue galaxies in high redshift clusters compared to local ones ( the butcher - oemler effect ) , indicating on - going star formation in high redshift clusters .",
    "since then there have been many studies on the dependence of this effect on the environment , and cluster properties such as the x - ray temperature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "rx j1347 - 1145 is the most x - ray luminous cluster known , and has an elongated large - scale structure ; therefore it is interesting to explore the colour distribution of the galaxies in this structure .",
    "the colour - magnitude diagram of galaxies in the four pointings along the structure is shown in figure [ cmd ] .",
    "open circles are all galaxies in the field of view , crosses are galaxies with secure redshift obtained , and filled circles are members associated with the structure .",
    "we calculate the blue fraction of the main cluster using the @xcite criterion , i.e. galaxies 0.2 mag bluer than the cmr in rest - frame ( b - v ) .",
    "we transform rest - frame @xmath83 into our observed @xmath84 using the colour difference between e and sab galaxies from @xcite , as indicated by the dashed lines in figure [ cmd ] .",
    "the number of blue cluster members is calculated by dividing the number of spectroscopically confirmed blue galaxies by the completeness of the spectroscopy for the blue population .",
    "the number of red cluster members is calculated in the same way , and the total number of members is then the sum of that of the blue and red galaxies .",
    "the blue fraction of rx j1347 - 1145 within the central 1.4 mpc ( @xmath85 ) , down to @xmath86 ( corresponding to @xmath87 ) is @xmath88 .",
    "the uncertainty is estimated using the weighted binomial statistics @xcite .",
    "note although rx j1347 - 1145 is the most x - ray luminous cluster in the rass , its blue fraction in the central region is similar to that of other less luminous clusters @xcite , consistent with the lack of x - ray luminosity dependence found by @xcite .",
    "the blue fraction of the cluster rxj1347-sw ( @xmath89 ) is , within the uncertainty , consistent with that of the main cluster .    from the contours in figure [ sig ]",
    ", the region between the main cluster and rxj1347-sw shows an overdensity of red - sequence galaxies .",
    "our spectroscopy also reveals a large population of blue galaxies , and it is interesting to note that they form two trails running in the same direction as the elongation of the large - scale structure .",
    "the large blue population associated with an overdensity of red galaxies is particularly interesting .",
    "it suggests that targeting regions with overdensities of red - sequence galaxies for spectroscopic follow - up is a strategy that allows the efficient selection of cluster members , while still tracing interesting structures with active star formation .",
    "a more thorough analysis of the stellar populations in the large - scale structure will be done when the rest of the data are obtained .      in this section , we estimate the mass of the main cluster and rxj1347-sw using different methods .",
    "we defer a comparison with the literature , and the discussion of the dynamical implication , to  [ dyn ] .          for a given density profile and velocity anisotropy",
    ", the velocity dispersion can be used to infer the virial mass . under the assumption of a singular isothermal density profile and a velocity anisotropy that satisfies @xmath90 @xcite ,",
    "the virial mass can be expressed as @xmath91 .",
    "applying this to the measured velocity dispersion (  [ vdisp ] ) yields a @xmath92=1.16^{+0.32}_{-0.27 } \\times 10^{15 } m_{\\odot}$ ] , with @xmath93=1.85 $ ] mpc .",
    "this mass estimate agrees well with that inferred from the richness of the cluster , as described in  [ photst ] .    under the same assumptions ,",
    "the mass of rxj1347-sw is estimated to be @xmath94 , with @xmath95 mpc .",
    "this @xmath53 is also in good agreement with that inferred from the richness , and confirms that the cluster rxj1347-sw we detected photometrically using the red - sequence galaxies is indeed a massive cluster .",
    "there has not been any report on the existence of this cluster in the literature .",
    "another method to estimate the mass through dynamical analysis is the caustic technique , under the assumption that clusters form through hierarchical accretion @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this technique is that it does not depend on the assumption of dynamical equilibrium , and it can probe the mass out to large radii where the virial theorem does not apply any more .    as described in ",
    "[ voffset ] ( figure [ vr ] ) , cluster members occupy a region in velocity space with a trumpet shape delineated by caustics that separate them from the hubble flow . assuming spherical symmetry , the mass of the cluster can be estimated as : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the amplitude of the caustic .",
    "the prescription for implementing the caustic method is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "here we only summarize the key steps . since the location of the caustics is where clusters are separated from the hubble flow , it is indicated by a significant drop of the density of cluster members in velocity space .",
    "therefore , one first calculates the density as a function of velocity at different radii , using an adaptive kernel method ( silverman 1986 ) . in order to use the spherical smoothing window ,",
    "the window size in velocity and distance , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , has to be rescaled ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) . for our data ,",
    "we choose @xmath100 , and a spherical smoothing window size of @xmath12 700 km / s . in the central region of clusters ,",
    "the escape velocity ( essentially the location of the caustics ) is twice the velocity dispersion , which is valid under the assumption that the central region of the cluster is virialized .",
    "therefore , in practice , the threshold density where the significant drop occurs ( and thus determines the amplitude of the caustics ) is chosen so that the above condition is satisfied .",
    "the deprojected mass profile of the main cluster estimated using this technique is shown as solid dots in both panels of figure [ mcau ] .",
    "the errors are estimated using jackknife resampling @xcite . at @xmath4",
    "mpc the enclosed mass is @xmath101 .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with that inferred from the velocity dispersion ; however , this is largely true by construction , since the density threshold is chosen such that the two techniques agree within the virialized region of the cluster .",
    "the caustic - based measurements have the most value at larger radii , where the assumption of virial equilibrium is unlikely to hold .",
    "note beyond @xmath102 mpc , we only have sparse sampling in two pointings , and the velocity distribution of galaxies in these pointings is not likely representative of that of the whole population at that radius , due to the presence of elongated large - scale structure .",
    "we fit the mass profile to a nfw @xcite and isothermal profile , shown as the solid and dotted curves respectively in the left panel of figure [ mcau ] and discussed in  [ voffset ] . ] . because of the large uncertainties on the mass profile due to limited data",
    ", the two profiles can not be distinguished .",
    "we use the deep cfht @xmath19 imaging data to study the cluster mass distribution using weak gravitational lensing .",
    "unlike dynamical methods , the weak lensing signal provides a direct measurement of the _ projected _ mass , irrespective of the dynamical state of the cluster .",
    "furthermore , the observed signal can be used to `` map '' the distribution of dark matter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our cluster weak lensing analysis follows in detail the steps described in @xcite . in order to relate the lensing signal to a physical mass requires knowledge of the redshift distribution of the sources .",
    "the wavelength coverage and limited depth of the observations prevent us from deriving accurate photometric redshifts for the individual sources .",
    "instead we use the results from @xcite who determined photometric redshifts for galaxies in the cfhtls deep fields .    to determine the lensing signal",
    ", we measure the shapes of galaxies with @xmath103 .",
    "we use such a relatively faint cut because of the high redshift of the cluster .",
    "the galaxy shapes are corrected using the method presented in @xcite , with modifications described in @xcite .",
    "the weak lensing signal is sensitive to all structure along the line - of - sight and , as shown in @xcite , this distant ( uncorrelated ) large - scale structure introduces additional noise to the mass estimate .",
    "this ` cosmic shear ' noise is included in the errors listed below .",
    "we note that the noise due to the intrinsic ellipticities of the sources dominates because of the relatively high cluster redshift .    the weak lensing reconstruction of the projected surface density with a smoothing scale of 123.3@xmath104 is presented in figure  [ s2n ] ] out to @xmath105 mpc .",
    "to indicate more clearly which structures are significant , we show the signal - to - noise ratio , rather than the signal itself , as the grey scale ( see the left panel in figure [ dres ] for a more detailed view ) .",

    "no other significant structures are evident in this map .",
    "the contours of the overdensity of the red - sequence galaxies , the same as in figure [ sig ] , are overplotted on top of the mass map . for the main cluster and rxj1347-sw ,",
    "the mass concentrations coincide with the overdensities of red - sequence galaxies .",
    "= 8.5 cm    the smoothing of the mass map limits its use to determine the cluster mass .",
    "instead , we compute the mean tangential distortions as a function of distance from the cluster center . the resulting measurements for the main cluster and rxj1347-sw are shown in figure  [ gtprof ] .",
    "we estimate the cluster masses from these shear measurements using two different methods .",
    "the first , and most commonly used , is to assume a density profile and determine the best fit parameters to the observed tangential distortion . for comparison with the dynamical results",
    ", we first fit a singular isothermal sphere model ( sis ) to the observations between 500 kpc and 2 mpc , which yields a velocity dispersion of @xmath108 km / s , in excellent agreement with the results based on the redshifts of the cluster galaxies .",
    "thanks to the wide - field lensing data , we can also apply the same method to rxj1347-sw ( centred at 13@xmath10946@xmath11027.2@xmath111 , @xmath11254@xmath113 ) , for which we obtain a velocity dispersion of @xmath114 km / s , also in good agreement with the value inferred from the redshifts of the cluster members .",
    "although the sis allows for an easy comparison to the observed velocity dispersion , a more physically motivated function is the nfw @xcite profile , which has been inferred from numerical simulations .",
    "we assume the mass - concentration relation from @xcite and fit the nfw model to the data within 500 kpc and 2mpc . with these assumptions ,",
    "we find a best - fit value for the virial mass of @xmath115 . the best fit nfw model within different apertures",
    "are indicated by stars in the left panel of figure  [ mcau ] . for rxj1347-sw",
    "we obtain @xmath116 .",
    "to compare to the results from the cluster galaxy dynamics , we also compute the corresponding masses within @xmath117  mpc .",
    "for this choice of radius we obtain @xmath118 for the main cluster .",
    "this result is in excellent agreement with the value inferred from dynamics . for rxj1347-sw",
    "we obtain @xmath119 for @xmath120  mpc .",
    "since weak lensing signals are sensitive to the total mass projected along the line - of - sight ; it is interesting to consider a non - parametric estimate for the projected mass within an aperture ( e.g. @xcite ; see hoekstra ( 2007 ) for our implementation ) .",
    "the resulting _ projected _ masses as a function of radius are presented in figure  [ m_proj ] as solid hexagons .",
    "figure  [ m_proj ] also shows other estimates from the literature , which will be discussed in detail in  [ lit ] .",
    "as discussed in hoekstra ( 2007 ) and @xcite one can assume spherical symmetry to deproject the resulting masses .",
    "we assume an nfw profile to extrapolate along the line - of - sight , but note that the results at large radii do not depend strongly on this assumption .",
    "the resulting deprojected masses are shown as open squares in the left panel of figure [ mcau ] .",
    "they are consistent with our dynamical mass estimate using the velocity caustics , within the uncertainties .    within an aperture of @xmath121  mpc",
    ", we find a deprojected mass for the main cluster of @xmath122 , again in excellent agreement with the dynamical measurements .",
    "similarly we find a mass of @xmath123 for rxj1347-sw using @xmath120  mpc , which is somewhat larger than the dynamical mass .",
    "the mass estimate and the dynamical state of this cluster have been the focus of many previous studies . in this section , we first compare the mass estimated using different methods in this work and in the literature , and then discuss the dynamical state of the cluster .      the mass of rx j1347 - 1145 has been estimated using different techniques .",
    "other than through the dynamics and weak lensing signals as described in  [ massest ] ,",
    "x - ray data have also been used to infer the mass .    in a recent study by @xcite",
    ", they estimate the mass by finding a nfw mass profile @xcite that reproduces the observed x - ray temperature profile .",
    "the resulting integrated mass at different radii are plotted as open triangles in the right panel of figure [ mcau ] .",
    "this is consistent with our estimates from both the dynamics and the weak lensing analysis (  [ massest ] ) .    similarly , the study by @xcite estimated the virial mass by fitting a nfw profile to their chandra observations , and their @xmath53 is plotted as the solid hexagon in the right panel of figure [ mcau ] .",
    "other mass estimates using x - ray data by @xcite and @xcite are plotted in the right panel of figure [ mcau ] as well .",
    "all these estimates at different radii are consistent within their error bars .    as discussed in ",
    "[ len ] , the projected mass is a more direct measurement than the _ deprojected _ mass from the weak lensing analysis , since it is the total projected mass along the line - of - sight that gives rise to the weak lensing signals ; therefore , it is more direct to compare the measured projected mass from different studies .    in figure",
    "[ m_proj ] , the projected mass enclosed within a certain radius estimated from strong , weak , and combined lensing analyses in the literature are plotted , along with our weak lensing estimate ( see legends ) . our weak lensing mass estimate ( solid hexagons ) is consistent with that of @xcite ( the solid triangle ) , and these two estimates are themselves in agreement with the x - ray analysis of @xcite ( the solid square ) .",
    "the weak lensing mass estimate by @xcite is slightly higher ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "this discrepancy is likely due to differences in the assumed source redshift distribution ; @xcite base their estimate on @xmath125 spectroscopy over the small area of the hubble deep field , while we use the photometric redshift distribution from the cfhtls deep survey . given our good agreement with both x - ray and dynamical mass estimates",
    ", it seems likely that their analysis underestimates the mean source redshift , and thus overestimates the cluster mass .    in comparison , the mass estimates from strong lensing studies @xcite and the combined strong and weak lensing analysis by @xcite are systematically higher . in general strong",
    "lensing provides an accurate estimate of the projected mass only within the central few hundred kpc , whereas the weak lensing mass is better constrained at larger radii ; therefore caution should be taken when combining strong and weak lensing analysis .",
    "see also @xcite for a summary and more discussion of the comparison among these works .",
    "the good agreement shown in figures [ mcau ] and [ m_proj ] suggest that the mass estimated from dynamical , x - ray , and weak lensing studies is generally consistent , while strong lensing gives a slightly higher value .",
    "so far , there has been only one other published redshift survey on this cluster , by @xcite .",
    "they derived from 47 cluster members in their sample a velocity dispersion of 910@xmath126 km s@xmath2 , using the same bi - weight method by @xcite as used in this work . this is lower than the value we derived , and thus leads to a lower mass that is in conflict with that from other methods .",
    "however , we believe that the value quoted in their paper is in error .",
    "when we reanalyze the 47 redshifts as given in their table 1 , we obtain a velocity dispersion of @xmath127 km s@xmath2 .",
    "therefore , there is actually no discrepancy between the dynamical mass estimate and that from x - ray and lensing analysis .",
    "one important reason the merger scenario was proposed for this cluster is to explain the large discrepancy between the mass estimated from the velocity dispersion by @xcite and the x - ray and lensing mass estimates discussed in the above section . however , as shown above , our new measurement resolves this discrepancy , and thus removes the original motivation for believing the system is undergoing a major merger .",
    "nonetheless , there is other evidence suggesting that this cluster might have recently undergone a merger .",
    "although the x - ray morphology is generally relaxed in the centre of the cluster , the existence of a region with shocked gas @xmath12820 arcsec ( @xmath129 mpc ) se of the cluster centre has been detected as a high - pressure region in x - ray observations @xcite and a strong decrement in the sunyaev - zeldovich observations @xcite .",
    "also , @xcite found that their strong lensing data can be much better described by a two component model with comparable mass than the single mass component model .",
    "the fact that there are two very bright galaxies in the centre of this cluster 18@xmath130 ( @xmath12 0.1 mpc ) apart in the plane of sky is also taken as a possible indication of a merger event ( but note their line - of - sight relative velocity is only @xmath131100 km / s ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that one possible scenario is a collision of equal mass clumps with a collision speed of 4600 km s@xmath2 .",
    "however , this collision can not be mostly along the line - of - sight , because as shown in  [ vdisp ] ( and also in the work by @xcite ) , the redshift distribution is better described as a single gaussian distribution . as discussed in ",
    "[ vdisp ] , our velocity data are also consistent ( at the 30% significance level ) , with a model distribution having two gaussian components .",
    "however , even in that case , the radial velocity offset between the two peaks is only about 1000 km s@xmath2 , much smaller than 4600 km s@xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , if the centre of the cluster is indeed composed of two merging components , each with a much smaller velocity dispersion than what we find for the system as a whole ( see  [ vdisp ] ) , the dynamically  estimated mass profile would be much lower than that shown in figure [ mcau ] ( the hexagon and the filled points ) , and that would be inconsistent with the weak lensing and x - ray mass estimates .    to investigate this further",
    ", we use the @xmath132-test proposed by @xcite to examine closely the 3d substructures in the centre of the main cluster .",
    "this test measures the deviation of the local velocity and velocity dispersion from the global mean , and is quantified as : @xmath133,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath134 is the number of neighbour galaxies , @xmath135 and @xmath136 are local mean velocity and dispersion measured from each galaxy and its @xmath134 nearest neighbours , and @xmath137 and @xmath45 are global mean velocity and velocity dispersion , respectively .    in the left panel of figure [ dres ] ,",
    "we show the spatial distribution of the confirmed cluster members ( solid squares ) with their local deviation from the global mean indicated by the size ( proportional to @xmath38 ) of the circle around them .",
    "the solid circles indicate negative local deviations ( @xmath138 ) , and dashed open circles positive local deviations ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "to examine closely the centre of the cluster , in this panel we only plot the region within a radius of @xmath46 mpc from the cluster centre .",
    "the two triangles indicate the two bcgs .",
    "the region @xmath140 arcsec se of cluster centre , indicated by the large green filled circle , is where the shocked gas is detected . around that region",
    ", we do not detect significant deviation from the global mean .",
    "however , there seems to be a hint of a segregation between the region ne and sw of the cluster centre , in the sense that in the ne region most galaxies have negative local mean velocity relative to the mean redshift of the cluster , while galaxies in the sw region mostly have positive local mean relative velocity .",
    "this segregation is along the same direction connecting the main cluster and rxj1347-sw .",
    "note the above estimated local mean might be biased by a few galaxies with large deviations due to our sparse data sampling .",
    "therefore , in the right panel of figure [ dres ] , we examine directly the spatial distribution of the redshift of individual galaxies , with a field of view of @xmath122 mpc @xmath141 2 mpc .",
    "the open circles indicate possible potential members ( not targeted ) , and the crosses represent nonmembers .",
    "cluster members with @xmath142 are indicated by the blue solid squares , and members with @xmath143 are indicated by the red solid squares .",
    "there is a hint that more galaxies with negative relative velocity reside in the region ne to the cluster centre . to test whether the distribution of the two samples is significantly different ,",
    "we apply a 2-dimensional kolmogorov - smirnov test following the procedure proposed by @xcite .",
    "the test suggests that there is a @xmath1260 per cent probability that galaxies with negative and positive relative velocity have different spatial distributions .",
    "the above evidence discussed in this section suggests that this might be a merger more in the plane of the sky than along the line - of - sight .",
    "however , with the lack of both a clear sharp shock front and a distinct separation of mass concentration on both sides of the shock ( see contours in the left panel of figure [ dres ] ) , as observed in the famous example of merger in the plane of the sky , the bullet cluster ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the exact merger scenario still needs closer examination both in observations and simulations .",
    "as seen in figure [ vr ] , cluster rxj1347-sw is @xmath9 mpc ( projected in the plane of sky ) away from the main cluster , and has a rest - frame velocity offset of @xmath124000 km s@xmath2 relative to the main cluster .",
    "this could be a result of two scenarios .",
    "one is that rxj1347-sw is at nearly the same distance as the main cluster , and is falling into the cluster at a speed of @xmath75 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the other is that it is @xmath144 mpc in the background moving with hubble expansion .",
    "we resort to simulations to try distinguishing these two scenarios .",
    "since what we are looking for is how likely it is for two clusters like rx j1347 - 1145 and rxj1347-sw to have a relative peculiar velocity as large as observed , we use the hubble volume simulations @xcite because of its large box size ( @xmath145mpc@xmath146 ) .    from the cluster catalogue in the full - sky light cone with @xmath147cdm cosmology ( @xmath148 ) , we search , in a redshift range close to the redshift of rxj1347 , for a pair of clusters that have similar masses ( @xmath149 ) , projected distance ( @xmath105 mpc ) , and rest - frame velocity offset as rx j1347 - 1145 and rxj1347-sw .",
    "we do not find any system where they are at the same distance , but with an observed velocity offset of @xmath75 km s@xmath2 .",
    "this does not mean definitely that no system could have such a large relative peculiar velocity , because this is based on only one simulation with a large but still limited volume , under the assumption of one particular set of cosmological parameters . among these parameters , @xmath150 is the most uncertain one , and in fact a lower value than used in the simulation is preferred by the latest wmap measurement @xcite .",
    "however , in that case , the peculiar velocity between clusters would be even lower due to the lower attracting force from the lower mass density . even though we can not reach a definitive conclusion",
    ", this does suggest that the probability that rxj1347-sw is falling into the main cluster with such a high velocity is low ; instead , it is more likely to be in the background .",
    "however , just because rxj1347-sw is far in the background does not necessarily mean that there is no connection between it and the main cluster .",
    "the fact that we observed an excess of galaxies between the two in velocity space ( figure [ vr ] ) suggests there might be a physical connection ( see @xcite for a report of the spectroscopic detection of a large - scale galaxy filament associated with a massive cluster at @xmath151 ; also @xcite ) .",
    "we compare our observation with simulations to see if the observed excess of galaxies could represent a real large - scale filamentary structure connecting the main cluster and rxj1347-sw , rather than foreground and background galaxies _ projected _ in velocity space . to examine this on the scale of individual galaxies ,",
    "we make use of the galaxy catalogue from a semi - analytic model by @xcite based on the high resolution millennium simulation @xcite .",
    "because of the small volume of the simulation , there are only four clusters that have mass greater than @xmath152 .",
    "we search around these four clusters for a second cluster with lower mass and at a similar distance projected in the plane of sky and along the line - of - sight from the more massive cluster as in the case of our observed rx j1347 - 1145 and rxj1347-sw .",
    "for the four pairs of systems we found , we calculate the line - of - sight velocity offset of each galaxy relative to the more massive cluster , and plot it as a function of distance , projected along the direction towards the less massive one . for direct comparison with our observed data , we only plot galaxies in a strip with a width similar to the radius of the fov as our spectroscopic observation , down to the same magnitude limit as our data . in figure [ simucon ]",
    "we show one extreme case , where the two clusters ( @xmath153 , @xmath154 ) are connected by a physical , large - scale filament traced by galaxies , with two other clusters in between .",
    "this structure is clearly visible in velocity space .",
    "the triangles indicate galaxies that are spatially within a cylinder with a radius of 3 mpc ( comparable to the virial radius of the more massive cluster ) connecting the two clusters .",
    "this is an extreme case where the galaxy filament is very impressive due to the presence of two other massive systems in between the two clusters .",
    "however , even in other cases in the simulation where the excess of galaxies between two clusters is smaller ( @xmath155 ) than this one , the excess is still due to galaxies that _ physically reside _ in the region between two clusters , instead of being purely due to a _ projection _ effect . although this is not definitive , it does support the possibility that the excess of galaxies we observe in velocity space between the two clusters reflects a real physical structure",
    "in this work , we presented photometric and spectroscopic analysis on the dynamics and large - scale structure around the most x - ray luminous cluster rx j1347 - 1145 , and found the following results : + @xmath156 we identified an elongated large - scale structure around the main cluster , photometrically using red - sequence galaxies , and discovered a rich cluster ( rxj1347-sw ) @xmath9 mpc ( projected ) away from the main cluster .",
    "+ @xmath156 the velocity dispersion of the main cluster is 1163@xmath63 km s@xmath2 , corresponding to @xmath157 , with @xmath4 mpc .",
    "+ @xmath156 our dynamical mass estimates based on both the velocity dispersion and velocity caustics are consistent with our weak lensing analysis , and the x - ray studies in the literature .",
    "we also find excellent agreement between these mass estimates and that estimated photometrically from the abundance of red - sequence galaxies ( the richness ) .",
    "+ @xmath156 our new measurement resolves a previous claimed discrepancy between the dynamical mass estimate and other methods @xcite .",
    "+ @xmath156 our spectroscopic analysis confirmed that the photometrically identified structure rxj1347-sw is indeed a massive cluster , with a velocity dispersion of @xmath158 km s@xmath2 .",
    "+ @xmath156 our weak lensing analysis shows good correspondence between the mass concentration and the overdensity of red - sequence galaxies in the main cluster and rxj1347-sw .",
    "+ @xmath156 comparing with simulations , the observed excess of galaxies between the main cluster and rxj1347-sw relative to other regions around the main cluster in velocity space suggests a possible filamentary structure connecting these two clusters .",
    "this structure has a large population of blue galaxies associated with the overdensity of red - sequence galaxies , suggesting that targeting overdensities of red - sequence galaxies for spectroscopic follow - up allows the efficient selection of cluster members , while still tracing interesting structures with active star formation . +",

    "our overall completeness is about 50 per cent .    for red galaxies , in pointings  centre  and  sw  , about 90 per cent of galaxies with secure redshifts obtained turned out to be members ; and in the rest of the two less densed pontings , the efficiency is @xmath1260 per cent and @xmath1270 per cent . for blue galaxies ,",
