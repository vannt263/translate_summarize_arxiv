    "spin related transport in magnetic microstructures has drawn considerable interests in research community for the purpose of spintronics.@xcite in order to manipulate the spin degree of freedom of an electron , one needs first to build a source of spin - polarized electrons and efficiently injects spins into a non - polarized medium .",
    "the ferromagnetic metal ( fm ) is an ideal spin source for spin injection into semiconductor devices ; however , the injection efficiency experimentally measured is extremely low due to the much larger conductivity of fm than that of semiconductor.@xcite this issue has not yet been resolved although it is fundamentally important . as an alternative solution to the spin injection problem ,",
    "the pure spin current was proposed and has attracted much attention in recent years .",
    "the pure spin current is composed of equal spin down and spin up electron currents flowing along opposite directions without any charge current.@xcite several different methods have been proposed to create pure spin current . based on the spin pumping principle,@xcite an alternating or inhomogeneous magnetic field as",
    "a spin - pumping force could result in a pure spin current .",
    "experimentally , stevens _ _ et al.__@xcite and hubner _ _ et al.__@xcite have independently realized the pure spin current by using the quantum interference of two - color laser fields with cross - linear polarization in znse and gaas semiconductors .",
    "the transport of spin current by magnons have been theoretically studied by several groups,@xcite e.g. , meier _ _ et al.__@xcite demonstrated that by using a finite length spin chain between magnetic reservoirs , pure spin current can be generated without the transport of electrical charge .",
    "the equilibrium spin current ( esc ) in a magnetic or nonmagnetic system is also very attractive .",
    "the newly unearthed spin hall current , discovered by murakami _ _ et al.__@xcite in @xmath4-doped semiconductors and sinova _ _ et al.__@xcite in two - dimensional electron systems ( 2deg ) , is actually a dissipationless spin current , which is a transverse response to a longitudinal external electric field @xmath5 .",
    "the spin hall current in a 2deg is generated by the rashba spin orbital interaction ( rsoi ) . in a single rsoi system",
    "the spin state of an electron is dependent on its momentum direction , so that at equilibrium the spin current could flow in the system without bias.@xcite as long as a system has noncollinear magnetic order , a esc could exist in the system.@xcite for instance , knig _ _ et al.__@xcite found a dissipationless spin current in a thin film ferromagnet , in which a spiral magnetic order exists and the spin phase coherence can affect the electronic transport properties .    for the fm / fm tunnelling junction , a spontaneous esc has been verified@xcite flowing across the interface when the two magnetic moments @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the two leads of the junction are not collinear , and their exchange interaction determines the esc @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "this indicates non - collinear magnetizations in the two leads can lead to spin flip and consequently a esc through the junction .",
    "nogueira _ _ et al.__@xcite and lee _ _ et al.__@xcite referred to the esc through the fm / fm junction as the spin supercurrent as an analogy to the josephson effect in superconductor junctions .",
    "the spin current in a fm / fm junction was also shown to result in magnetic moment reversal in one of the fm leads of the junction.@xcite    in 2deg with rsoi or dresselhaus spin orbital interaction ( dsoi ) , there is a pseudomagnetic field which could lead to esc in the non - magnetic system .",
    "this pseudomagnetic field is different from a real magnetic field as it is dependent on the direction of electron momentum and keeps the system s time reversal symmetry .",
    "a natural question thus arises whether a spin supercurrent ( or esc ) could flow through a _",
    "nonmagnetic _ tunnelling junction in which the electrodes are 2degs with either rsoi or dsoi",
    ". a recent paper@xcite by brkje and sudb has been dedicated to this issue and authors obtained a esc in a 2deg junction with rsoi by rotating one of the 2deg electrodes along the current direction to change the direction of the pseudomagnetic field , so that the product of two pseudomagnetic fields in two leads is nonzero , meanwhile , the absence of esc through the 2deg / fm tunnelling junction was also predicted . in this paper , we will study systematically the esc in three different junctions : 2deg/2deg , 2deg / fm , and fm / fm junctions , using the linear response theory .",
    "it is found that esc is present in all three junctions resulting from the exchange coupling between the two magnetic moments in the two electrodes of the junctions .",
    "non - magnetic 2deg with rsoi or dsoi as an electrode in a tunnelling junction can lead to a esc , because only half of the electrons ( those with @xmath8 , if the 2deg is on the left of the junction ) in an electrode contribute to the tunnelling current so that the isotropic rsoi or dsoi can give rise to an average planar effective magnetic field orthogonal or parallel to the current direction .",
    "we also found that in a strict one - dimensional ( 1d ) case rsoi or dsoi can not result in a esc in the junction because the 1d density of states is not spin - polarized , which is very different from that of a 1d fm lead .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way . in the second part",
    ", we give a general formula of the esc in a tunnelling junction derived using the linear response theory . in the third part",
    ", we analyze in detail the esc in three junctions : 2deg/2deg , 2deg / fm , and fm / fm junctions .",
    "a conclusion was drawn in the last section .",
    "we start our discussion with the derivation of a general formula of esc through a junction , consisting of two leads of either 2deg with rsoi ( dsoi ) or fm metal and an insulator barrier between them .",
    "the hamiltonian of such a tunnelling system is given by    @xmath9    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the hamiltonian of a non - interacting free - electron gas in the left ( right ) lead , whose specific form will be present in next section ; @xmath12 is the tunnelling part connecting two leads . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the fermion creation ( annihilation ) operators of the left and right leads , respectively . the hopping matrix",
    "@xmath15 is independent of spin , so that there is no spin - flip when electrons tunnel through the junction . in the following discussion the quantum number @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    "can also denote implicitly the left and right lead .",
    "we focus on the tunnelling esc and the bulk esc in the rsoi ( dsoi ) lead is not considered here because it does not contribute to the tunnelling current .",
    "the total spin in the left lead is @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are spin indices , and @xmath21 is the pauli spin operator . the time evolution of @xmath22 in the heisenberg picture is given by @xmath23 $ ] , and thus the operator of spin current @xmath24 reads @xmath25 here the coupling @xmath12 is assumed to be very weak and we only need to calculate the spin current to the lowest order of the coupling . since the spin current operator @xmath26 itself is already linear in @xmath15 , and thus according to the kubo formula the spin current is to first order in @xmath27 given by    @xmath28    @xmath29\\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath30 is the thermal statistical average on two independent leads @xmath31 ( the unperturbed part of @xmath32 ) , which are assumed to be in local equilibrium .",
    "@xmath33 is the retarded green s function .",
    "after some straightforward algebra and keeping the average only in lead @xmath34 or @xmath35 , we could express eq .",
    "3 in the steady state as @xmath36 where the trace @xmath37 is over the spin space , @xmath38 are the keldysh green s functions in the left ( right ) lead and can be readily solved for leads of free - electron model .",
    "their definitions are @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "the fourier transform of the green s function is given by @xmath41 .",
    "it is noted that eq .",
    "4 above is a general formula of spin current through a tunnelling junction and the bias could be reflected in the local equilibrium green s functions @xmath38 of the two leads . for zero bias on the junction considered in this article , i.e. , zero charge current flow through the junction ,",
    "we can further simplify eq .",
    "4 by putting @xmath42 with @xmath43 denoting the principle integral ,    @xmath44    @xmath45    here @xmath46 is the spectral function of the left ( right ) lead with @xmath47 denoting the retard ( advanced ) green s function and @xmath48 denoting the fermi distribution function .",
    "the esc in eq .",
    "5 is mainly determined by the difference between two hermitian - conjugate matrices in spin space , so that the off - diagonal term in the spectral function @xmath49 is utmost important to the formation of a esc in a tunnelling junction . for fm or 2deg with rsoi ( dsoi ) , this off - diagonal term in spin space exists when two magnetizations ( pseudomagnetic fields in 2deg ) are not collinear in the two leads , as a result , a nonzero esc can flow through the junction according to eq .  5 .",
    "in the following section we will discuss the esc in three specific junctions : 2deg/2deg , 2deg / fm , and fm / fm junctions .",
    "in this section we study the esc through a 2deg/2deg junction with spin orbital interaction .",
    "first we review briefly the characteristics of a 2deg with rsoi , which stems from the structure inversion asymmetry of the confining potential of a quantum well.@xcite the magnitude of the rsoi strength could be modulated by a vertical electric field @xmath50",
    "( @xmath51 is the unit vector in the @xmath52 direction in fig .",
    "1 ) applied on the 2deg .",
    "the hamiltonian of the 2deg with rsoi is    @xmath53    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the effective mass of electrons in the 2deg , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the two components of the momentum operator @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is the coupling constant and was estimated to be @xmath60 ev m in an ingaas / inalas heterostructure.@xcite @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the pauli matrices , and the @xmath52-axis is taken as the spin quantum axis .    the electron eigenfunctions of eq .",
    "( 6 ) are @xmath63 with @xmath64 , and the corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath65 .",
    "this wavefunction of electron reminds us that the spin orbital interaction can give rise to a magnetic field parallel to the plane , which is dependent on the direction of the electron momentum . from eq .",
    "6b , the effective ( pseudo ) magnetic field is @xmath66 .",
    "different from a real magnetic field , the rsoi keeps the system s isotropy and time - reversal symmetry @xmath67 , and",
    "the 2deg does not exhibit a real spin splitting like in the zeeman effect . this will result in a distinction between the esc in a 2deg junction and the esc in a fm junction .    although the pseudomagnetic field @xmath68 in 2deg is isotropic , only half of the electrons ( electrons with @xmath8 on the left and @xmath69 is the current direction in fig .",
    "1 ) in the 2deg contribute to the tunnelling current , as a result , the average pseudomagnetic field of the tunnelling electrons is nonzero and along the @xmath70 direction ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "if we could change the direction of the pseudomagentic field in one of the 2deg , a esc would flow through a 2deg/2deg junction .",
    "a celebrated example is the rsoi / dsoi junction , where one 2deg lead possesses rsoi while the other has dsoi . by exchanging the spin axis @xmath72",
    ", rsoi can be transformed into dsoi as @xmath73 this coupling is due to the lack of the bulk inversion symmetry in the material.@xcite thus in the rsoi / dsoi tunnelling junction , the average pseudomagnetic field in the dsoi lead is along the @xmath69 direction , which is different from that in the rsoi lead , so that a nonzero esc @xmath74 exists as shown below in eq .",
    "11 . in ref .  25 , brkje and sudb attempted to rotate one 2deg lead along the current direction ( @xmath69-direction in fig .",
    "1 ) so as to rotate the orientation of the pseudomagnetic field .",
    "however this method may not create a esc through the rsoi / rsoi junction as discussed below .",
    "the rotation of the average psuedomagnetic field could be also obtained by rotating physically a quasi - one - dimensional 2deg along the @xmath52-axis by an azimuthal angle @xmath19 , which is schematically shown in fig .  1 .",
    "since the pseudomagnetic field @xmath75 is dependent on the direction of the electron momentum , an oblique incident electron will feel pseudomagentic fields with different orientations when it tunnels through a rsoi / rsoi junction where the energy band edges of the two 2deg leads are different .",
    "this change in psuedomagnetic field direction could lead to a esc in the junction .",
    "the energy band shift in one 2deg lead may be obtained by applied a gate voltage or mechanical strain to the lead .    to understand the relation of a rotated pseudomagnetic field and esc",
    ", we consider a rotation of the spin @xmath76 axes by an angle @xmath19 with respect to the spatial @xmath76 axes .",
    "the rotated angle @xmath19 of the pseudomagnetic field could be incorporated into the pauli matrices @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "here @xmath19 is macroscopic in that it applies to all the electrons and may denote the rotation angle of the average pseudomagnetic field .    in second quantization formalism , eq .",
    "6 can be rewritten as @xmath79 where @xmath80 with @xmath81 the chemical potential , and @xmath82 . with @xmath83",
    "replaced by @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) as well as @xmath59 by @xmath86 , this hamiltonian can represent a free 2deg with dsoi in eq .",
    "7 . the retard ( advanced ) green s function of this free electron model with rsoi",
    "is easily given by @xmath87 before we present the final expression of esc of 2deg/2deg junction by substituting @xmath88 above into eq .",
    "5 , we first focus on the spectral function @xmath89 of 2deg with rsoi @xmath90 & -i\\pi [ \\delta_{-}-\\delta_{+}]e^{i\\theta }    \\\\    i\\pi [ \\delta_{-}-\\delta_{+}]e^{-i\\theta } & \\pi [ \\delta_{+}+\\delta_{- } ] \\\\ \\end{array}% \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath91 and @xmath92 with @xmath93 denoting the delta function . in the formula of esc ( eq .  5 ) , the summation term @xmath94 exists in the case of weak connection , i.e. , @xmath95 independent of energy . in a _",
    "strict one - dimensional _ case , the off - diagonal terms of this summation vanish @xmath96 ; thus , there is no esc through the junction as discussed earlier ( eq .  5 ) .",
    "this result stems from the fact that the 1d density of states of the two spin bands of an electron gas with rsoi or dsoi is not spin - polarized , which is very different from the fm case . in the 1d case",
    "the density of states is inversely proportional to the electron velocity , and the velocities of electrons in the two spin bands with the same energy under rsoi or dsoi are identical so that the summation of the off - diagonal terms in eq .  10 over @xmath16 vanishes . in other words ,",
    "the perpendicular incidence of electrons from one rsoi ( dsoi ) lead into another rsoi ( dsoi ) lead will conserve their spins whereas this is not the case for the obliquely incident electrons.@xcite therefore , the rotation of a 2deg along the current direction ( the @xmath69-axis in fig .",
    "1 ) in the 2deg/2deg tunnelling junction will give rise to two 2deg leads not in the same plane , and if the middle insulator barrier is very thin , the electron tunnelling in such a junction may be a 1d transport , i.e. , only electrons with velocity along the @xmath69-direction could tunnel through the junction due to the momentum mismatch . thus the esc may vanish in this scheme .    after straightforward algebra",
    ", the esc for the two - dimensional rsoi / dsoi junction ( two 2degs in the same plane ) is given by    @xmath97    @xmath98    and @xmath99    here @xmath100 is the rotation angle of the spin axes of the left ( right ) lead that changes the direction of the pseudomagnetic field .",
    "@xmath101 is the rashba energy with @xmath102 , @xmath103 is the fermi distribution function . @xmath104 is the conductance of the normal 2deg junction without spin - orbital interaction , @xmath105 is a constant density of state of 2deg .",
    "@xmath106 phase difference in eq .",
    "11c comes from the exchange of spin axes when dsoi is compared with rsoi . here we have assumed for simplicity the spin - orbital coupling constants of two leads are same @xmath107 and @xmath95 is independent of energy .    from eq .",
    "11 , only esc polarized along the @xmath52 direction is nonzero since the two pseudomagnetic fields in rsoi / dsoi junction lie in the @xmath108 plane , their exchange coupling will lead to spin current polarized along the @xmath52 direction .",
    "the phase ( rotation angle ) @xmath19 of the pseudomagnetic field is cannonically conjugate to the spin @xmath109 so that they satisfy the commutation relation @xmath110=-i$ ] , which means the spin component @xmath109 is not a conserved quantity as the rsoi ( dsoi ) can change @xmath109 by rotating the spin , and esc could hence flow in these junctions .",
    "the physics is similar to the josephson current in a superconductor junction,@xcite in which the macroscopic phase @xmath111 resulted from the condensation of cooper pairs is conjugate to the particle number @xmath112 and @xmath113=-i$].@xcite the continuity equation of the spin current in 2deg with rsoi(dsoi ) is @xmath114 , where @xmath115 $ ] is the spin current density with @xmath116 being the velocity operator , and @xmath117 $ ] is a source term from the pseudo - magnetic field by rotating the spin component @xmath109.@xcite a similar source term appears also in the continuity equation of the current of superconductor.@xcite      we turn to discuss esc in an 2deg / fm junction . in the last subsection",
    "it was stated that rsoi ( dsoi ) in 2deg can be equivalent to a pseudomagnetic field along the @xmath70 ( @xmath69 ) direction with @xmath118 when electrons tunnel through the junction .",
    "when one of the 2deg leads is substituted by a fm , a esc could also flow through the 2deg / fm junction from the point of view of the magnetic field .",
    "the hamiltonian of the fm in the right side of the junction is given in a simple framework of the stoner model by @xmath119 here the spin quantum axis is set to be along the local magnetic moment of fm , @xmath120 and @xmath121 ( use energy as the unit here ) is a molecular field in the fm .",
    "then the local retarded green s function is @xmath122 in the common spin quantum axis set along the @xmath52-direction for the 2deg / fm junction , i.e. the normal of the 2deg plane , the green s functions of the fm lead above should be transformed according to    @xmath123    @xmath124    where @xmath125 is the unitary transformation matrix , ( @xmath126,@xmath111 ) denotes the direction of the magnetic moment of the fm lead , which in terms of the unit vectors of the cartesian coordinates should be written as ( @xmath127,@xmath128,@xmath129 ) . for the specific rsoi / fm junction we consider , the rotation angle in the left lead",
    "is set as @xmath130 .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "14 and eq .  9 into eq .  5",
    ", we obtain the final result as    @xmath131    @xmath132    @xmath133    with    @xmath134    @xmath135    here the prime @xmath136 on the summation in eq .",
    "16b means that the incident angle @xmath83 of electron from 2deg into fm has been integrated out from @xmath137 to @xmath106 , which denotes only @xmath138 electrons contribute to the tunnelling current in our calculation .",
    "@xmath139 is the difference of the density of states of two spin bands in fm and 2deg . for the 1d case @xmath140 as discussed earlier",
    "; whereas for the fm cases with any dimensions , @xmath141 if the molecular field @xmath121 is nonzero .",
    "thus in 1d rsoi(dsoi)/fm junction , esc does not exist .",
    "15 indicates that in a rsoi / fm junction at zero bias a esc can also flow through the junction and rsoi in the left lead acts as a magnetic field with direction along the @xmath70-direction .",
    "according to the exchange coupling between the two magnetic moments in the two sides of the junction , @xmath142 is zero while @xmath143 and @xmath144 are nonzero . if rsoi in the left lead is replaced by dsoi to form a dsoi / fm junction , the esc of eq .",
    "15 is different , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 because in this case dsoi gives rise to an average pseudomagnetic field along the @xmath69-direction .",
    "the results we obtained here indicate again the rsoi ( dsoi ) in the tunnelling junction can play the same role as in a fm metal .      for completeness we present in this subsection the results of the esc through a fm / fm junction , which are same as those found in literatures.@xcite the spin quantum axis",
    "is taken as the magnetic moment direction of the left fm lead @xmath148(@xmath149,@xmath149,@xmath150 ) and the magnetic moment in the right fm lead is same as that in the last subsection @xmath151(@xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 ) . using the green s function ( eq .  14 ) of the fm lead ,",
    "we can obtain the formula of esc as    @xmath155    @xmath156    @xmath157    here @xmath158 is the difference between the density of states of the two spin bands of the left ( right ) fm lead as shown in eq .",
    "16a . in a simpler form , eq .",
    "17 can be written as @xmath159 , which means the esc comes from the exchange coupling between the two magnetizations in the left and right fm leads .",
    "only the spin component along @xmath160 is not a conserved quantitiy since both magnetizations in the two sides of the junction can flip the spin .",
    "the esc eq .",
    "11 and eq .  15 for the 2deg/2deg and 2deg / fm junction can also be expressed as the form of vector product of ( pseudo)magnetic moments .    in earlier works,@xcite this spin current in the fm /",
    "fm junction was found to transport spin torque and result in magnetization reversal in an unfixed fm lead .",
    "the spin current can also induce an electric field , which may be used to experimentally detect the esc through magnetic junctions.@xcite we wish to point out here the esc stemming from the exchange coupling of two magnetic moments in two leads is achieved based on the approximation of the linear response , beyond which it is unclear whether the above results are still valid , thus it is worthwhile to study the behavior of esc at the limit of the strong coupling .",
    "we have presented a detailed analysis of the dissipationless esc through three tunnelling junctions , 2deg/2deg , 2deg / fm , and fm / fm . for these three junctions ,",
    "the esc comes from the exchange coupling between two magnetic ( or pseudomagnetic ) moments in the two leads in the linear approximation .",
    "although in 2deg with rsoi or dsoi , the pseudomagnetic field is isotropic and keeps the time reversal symmetry , only electrons with @xmath8 contribute to the tunnelling current when 2deg with rsoi or dsoi is used as the left lead of the junction as in the 2deg/2deg and 2deg / fm junctions , so that the tunnelling electrons would feel an average nonzero pseudomagnetic field along the @xmath70-direction for rsoi or the @xmath69-direction for dsoi .",
    "the average pseudomagnetic fields have the same effect as a real magnetic moment and the esc could flow in both 2deg/2deg and 2deg / fm junctions . for the rsoi / dsoi junction , a spontaneous esc could form since the pseudomagnetic fields associated with rsoi or dsoi are inherently different . while for rsoi / rsoi or dsoi / dsoi junctions , one possibility is to rotate one of the leads to change the orientation of the pseudomagnetic field , or we could shift the energy band of one of the 2deg because the pseudomagnetic field is dependent on the direction of the electron momentum @xmath161 , which in turn is determined by the band edge .",
    "this is different from the magnetic moment in a fm electrode .",
    "another distinction between the _",
    "2deg _ with rsoi ( dsoi ) and",
    "fm lead is that in strict 1d case rsoi ( dsoi ) can not result in a esc through the junction , while this is not the case for 1d fm leads .",
