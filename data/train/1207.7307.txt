    "we put forward a general method for calculating the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of symmetric tridiagonal matrices by exploiting the property of bulk uniformity .",
    "this allows us to put the eigenvalues in the form of deformations , defined by suitable _",
    "shifts _ , of those of the fully uniform case , which are known to form a band .",
    "the modified density of the eigenmodes in the band is expressed in terms of functions which can be analytically evaluated and depend on the non - uniform matrix elements .",
    "a small number of localized eigenstates could emerge from the band and have to be accounted for separately .",
    "particular applications of this technique were made in refs .",
    "a symmetric @xmath0 tridiagonal matrix @xmath1 has @xmath2 independent real elements , namely @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "its spectral decomposition is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is orthogonal , its rows being the @xmath9 eigenvectors of @xmath10 with eigenvalues @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath10 is said to be _ mirror - symmetric _ if it is also symmetric with respect to the skew diagonal , namely @xmath13=0 $ ]  , where @xmath14 is the mirroring matrix . in the mathematical language",
    "such matrices are both _ persymmetric _",
    "( @xmath15 ) and _ centrosymmetric _ ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "it is known that the eigenvectors of a mirror - symmetric @xmath10 are either symmetric or antisymmetric  @xcite , @xmath17 this formula assumes that @xmath18 and the eigenvalues @xmath19 are listed in decreasing order .",
    "the eigenvectors can be completely expressed in terms of characteristic polynomials of submatrices of @xmath10 , evaluated at the eigenvalues . in order to prove this ,",
    "let us introduce the following notation for tridiagonal submatrices , @xmath20 and for the corresponding characteristic polynomials , @xmath21 ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 ; then @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; the eigenvalues are the @xmath9 solutions of the secular equation @xmath25 . by expanding from the bottom ( upper ) corners ,",
    "these polynomials are found to satisfy the recurrence relations    @xmath26    [ e.trirecurr ]    the following important and useful formula ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) expresses the product of two components of the same eigenvector , @xmath27 which holds for @xmath28 if one defines @xmath29 .",
    "one can assume @xmath30 for all @xmath31 , as otherwise the diagonalization of @xmath10 would split into the diagonalization of independent submatrices , so that the eigenvalues of @xmath10 are nondegenerate .",
    "hence , the derivatives of the characteristic polynomial at the eigenvalues do not vanish , @xmath32 , and eq .",
    "can be solved for the eigenvector components , for example @xmath33 and from one of these ( one can arbitrarily choose the positive root ) the remaining elements of the @xmath34-th eigenvector follow by means of eq .",

    "note also that the recurrence equations   give @xmath38 with the assumption @xmath39 ; these equations can be used for a sequential computation of the eigenvectors components once the eigenvalues are known .",
    "an important consequence of this construction is that , once the first components of the eigenvectors ( @xmath40 ) are determined from eq .  , the eigenvectors come out already normalized , i.e. , the matrix @xmath37 is orthogonal , making the explicit normalization unnecessary and tremendously simplifying the analytical calculations .    when the matrix size @xmath9 is large the characteristic polynomials @xmath41 have a high degree and the analytical evaluation of the eigenvalue decomposition is very demanding . in the forthcoming section we provide general simplified formulas for the eigenvalues and for the eigenvector elements , eqs .   and  , in the case of a quasi - uniform matrix @xmath10 .",
    "a uniform tridiagonal matrix has equal elements within each diagonal , namely @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and without loss of generality one can set @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in this case",
    "the recurrence relations   for the characteristic polynomials are found to be equal to those defining the chebyshev polynomials of the second kind  @xcite , @xmath46 the correspondence being @xmath47 . setting @xmath48 the chebyshev polynomials of the second kind",

    "a tridiagonal matrix @xmath10 is said to be _ quasi uniform _ if it is mainly constituted by a large uniform tridiagonal block @xmath54 of size @xmath55 ( with @xmath56 ) , i.e. , its elements are @xmath57 and @xmath58 . by",

    "again , without loss of generality we set @xmath45 and @xmath44 in what follows .",

    "their coefficients involve the nonuniform matrix elements and generally they can be easily calculated by means of eqs .  .",
