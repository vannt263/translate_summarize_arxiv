    "the two - nucleon system is one of the simplest strongly interacting systems .",
    "the study of the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) bremsstrahlung reaction , therefore , offers one of the most fundamental and direct avenues for understanding how the electromagnetic field interacts with strongly interacting hadronic systems . in the past , the @xmath0 bremsstrahlung reaction had been applied extensively mainly to learn about off - shell properties of the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "it should be clear , however , that off - shell effects are model - dependent and can not be measured , and therefore are meaningless quantities for the purpose of comparison .    even though the original motivation for investigating the @xmath0 bremsstrahlung reaction has fallen away , understanding the dynamics of such a fundamental process ,",
    "nevertheless , is of great importance from a general theoretical perspective .",
    "this is highlighted by the fact that none of the past models of @xmath0 bremsstrahlung could describe the high - precision proton - proton bremsstrahlung data from kvi  @xcite for coplanar geometries involving small proton scattering angles .",
    "this was generally considered all the more surprising since the irrelevance of off - shell effects was taken as implicit proof positive that the coupling of a photon to the interacting two - nucleon system was under control .",
    "the discrepancy between the kvi data and the existing theoretical models , therefore , was quite unexpected .",
    "this longstanding discrepancy of nearly a decade was resolved recently by the present authors @xcite who put forward a novel approach to the @xmath0 bremsstrahlung reaction that takes into account details of the photon coupling to interacting systems that had previously been neglected .",
    "the study , in particular , revealed the importance of accounting for the corresponding interaction currents in a manner consistent with the gauge - invariance constraint .",
    "another recent bremsstrahlung experiment concerns the hard bremsstrahlung process @xmath7 measured for the first time by the cosy - anke collaboration @xcite . in the absence of free systems of bound diprotons ,",
    "this process was considered as an alternative to the @xmath8 process which complements the photo - disintegration of the deuteron . here , the hardness of the bremsstrahlung is due to the fact that the invariant mass of the two protons in the final state is constrained experimentally to be less than 3 mev above its minimum value of twice the proton mass . in this kinematic regime , the two protons in the final state",
    "are practically confined to the @xmath9 state and most of the available energy is carried by the bremsstrahlung .",
    "therefore , this kinematic regime is as far away from the soft - photon limit as possible .",
    "the proton - proton ( @xmath10 ) hard bremsstrahlung reaction has been also measured at celsius - uppsala @xcite . in spite of extensive studies of the @xmath0 bremsstrahlung reaction in the past , no dedicated experiments of @xmath10 hard bremsstrahlung with the diproton in the final state had been available until these recent measurements  @xcite . also , apart from the very recent study of ref .",
    "@xcite , the theoretical investigation of the @xmath11 reaction is virtually inexistent so far .",
    "apart from the intrinsic interest in the elementary @xmath0 bremsstrahlung process , the investigation of this reaction has also an immediate impact in the area of heavy - ion physics .",
    "indeed , di - lepton production in heavy - ion collisions is used intensively as a probe of hadron dynamics in the nuclear medium . due to their weak interaction with hadrons ,",
    "di - leptons are well suited to probe the hadron dynamics in the dense region of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the hades collaboration , in particular , is currently engaged actively in the study of di - electron production in heavy - ion as well as in elementary @xmath0 collisions in the 1 - 2 gev/@xmath12 energy domain @xcite . in order to interpret the experimental data in heavy - ion collisions , it is imperative to understand the underlying basic elementary processes . unfortunately , these basic elementary processes are not yet fully under control .",
    "in fact , there is a number of theoretical efforts to understand these basic reaction processes @xcite . according to these studies , among the various competing mechanisms ,",
    "the @xmath0 bremsstrahlung is one of the major mechanisms in producing di - electrons in these reactions .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the majority of the existing models of @xmath0 bremsstrahlung are potential models .",
    "they have been applied to the analyses of experimental data ( mostly in coplanar geometries ) obtained up until the early 2000s , before the more recent experiments mentioned above were performed . among those models ,",
    "the most recent and sophisticated ones that have been used in the analysis of the high - precision kvi data @xcite are the microscopic meson - exchange models of refs .",
    "there are also a number of other microscopic model calculations throughout the 1990s @xcite , which are dynamically similar to refs .",
    "@xcite , addressing a variety of issues in the @xmath0 bremsstrahlung process .",
    "all these models satisfy current conservation ( at least in the soft - photon approximation ) , bremsstrahlung , there are no exchange currents for ( uncharged ) mesons and the four - point contact current discussed in ref .",

    "( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) the meson - exchange currents are taken into account via siegert s theorem which preserves current conservation in the soft - photon limit . ] but none of them obey the more general gauge - invariance condition in terms of the generalized ward - takahashi identity ( wti ) employed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( and explained in more detail in the present work ) .",
    "quite recently , it was shown formally  @xcite how to maintain gauge invariance in a theory of undressed non - relativistic nucleons if one introduces a finite cutoff in a reference theory that is presumed to be already gauge invariant . when applied to effective field theories , in particular",
    ", this implies that gauge invariance can be maintained in such theories order - by - order in the expansion .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to present the complete , rigorous covariant formulation of the @xmath0 bremsstrahlung reaction whose successful advance application was reported in ref .",
    "the approach is based on a relativistic field theory in which the photon is coupled in all possible ways to the underlying two - nucleon @xmath14-matrix obtained from the corresponding covariant bethe - salpeter - type @xmath0 scattering equation .",
    "this formulation follows the basic procedures of the field - theoretical approach of haberzettl @xcite developed for pion photoproduction off the nucleon .",
    "the resulting bremsstrahlung amplitude satisfies unitarity and gauge invariance as a matter of course .",
    "the latter , in particular , is shown explicitly by deriving the corresponding generalized wti .",
    "the formalism is quite readily adapted to approximations and thus can be applied even in cases where the microscopic dynamical structure of the underlying interacting hadronic systems is either not known in detail or too complex to be treated in detail . as a case in point , we mention that the success of the advance application  @xcite of the present formalism to the kvi data  @xcite was due to the incorporation of phenomenological four - point contact currents that preserve gauge invariance following the approach of haberzettl , nakayama , and krewald  @xcite based on the original ideas of refs .  @xcite . in addition , we provide a scheme that permits the approximate treatment of current contributions resulting from pieces of the @xmath0 interaction that can not be incorporated exactly . in each case",
    ", the approximation procedure ensures gauge invariance of the entire bremsstrahlung amplitude .",
    "we also discuss the necessary modifications when taking into account baryonic states other than the nucleon @xmath1 ; in detail , we consider the @xmath2 resonance by incorporating the couplings of the @xmath0 to the @xmath3 and @xmath4 systems , and the @xmath5 transitions .    in sec .",

    "we point out , in particular , that if one aims for a dynamically consistent _ microscopic _ description of all reaction mechanisms , one must implement gauge invariance in terms of generalized ward - takahashi identities for each subprocess  mere global current conservation is not sufficient .",
    "we show how one can preserve the gauge invariance of the amplitude even if some interaction - current mechanisms  both for hadronic three- and four - point functions  can not be incorporated exactly .",

    "furthermore , the photon can be either real or virtual .",
    "the former corresponds to the usual @xmath0 bremsstrahlung process while the latter case is suited for applications in di - lepton production in both the elementary @xmath0 and heavy ion collisions .",
    "the bremsstrahlung current @xmath15 is obtained from the nucleon - nucleon @xmath14-matrix by attaching an outgoing photon to all reaction mechanisms of @xmath14 in all possible ways . to this end , we use here the gauge - derivative procedure developed in ref .",

    "this procedure is formally equivalent to employing minimal substitution for the connected part of the hadronic green s function , and then taking the functional derivative with respect to the electromagnetic four - potential @xmath16 , in the limit of vanishing @xmath16 ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "the current is then obtained by removing the propagators of all external hadron legs from this derivative in a lehmann - szymanzik - zimmermann ( lsz ) reduction procedure  @xcite .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon @xmath14-matrix is determined by the corresponding four - dimensional bethe - salpeter scattering equations , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the @xmath0 interaction given by the set of all two - nucleon irreducible scattering mechanisms .",

    "let us add some remarks here .",
    "even though the procedure to preserve gauge invariance was presented here in terms of an additional _ ad hoc _ current @xmath88 , the derivation shows that , rather than adding a current , the application of the three - dimensional reduction procedure to the current @xmath15 really amounts to _ dropping _ ( at least part of ) the reduced contribution from @xmath133 that was necessary in the full four - dimensional treatment to prevent double counting of the @xmath134 contribution .",
    "the particular form of @xmath123 of ( [ eq : bmut1 ] ) follows from exploiting the constraint ( [ eq : xmuconstr ] ) to the extent to which it is possible since the gauge invariance can not constrain transverse contributions .",
    "our applications reported here , in sec .",
    "[ sec : application ] , and in @xcite suggest that the choice @xmath135 yields by far the best numerical results . in view of the fact that the double - counted term @xmath134 in the full four - dimensional formulation of sec .",
    "[ sec:4dimformalism ] now appears in ( [ eq : modbmu ] ) as two distinctly different contributions @xmath136 , there are now no longer any terms counted doubly and thus the corresponding subtraction is no longer necessary either .",
    "the finding that @xmath135 yields the best numerical results is completely consistent with this fact . in our calculations , therefore , @xmath123 only contains transverse contributions from electromagnetic @xmath137 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 transitions ( for the latter , see discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : delta ] ) .",
    "the gauge - invariance constraints in terms of the generalized ward - takahashi identities , either in the form ( [ eq : wti ] ) for the full amplitude or as ( [ eq : divbmured ] ) for the reduced one , are just formal constraints , of course , since the only physically relevant  i.e. , measurable  ramification is current conservation when all external nucleons of the bremsstrahlung process are on their respective energy shells .",
    "it is for this reason that the current - conservation constraint , @xmath140 called _ global _ gauge invariance , is the only constraint that is implemented in many reaction models of photoprocesses .",
    "we would like to advocate , however , that using this as the sole constraint is not enough if one aims at providing a consistent _ microscopic _ description of the photoreaction at hand .",
    "it was shown in the preceding sections that the gauge invariance of the total bremsstrahlung amplitude hinges in an essential way on each subprocess providing its correct current share to ensure the gauge invariance of the entire current  and thus ultimately provide a conserved current .",
    "this is only possible if the current associated with each subprocess satisfies its own generalized ward - takahashi identity , as exemplified here by eq .",

    "this not only means that it will indeed satisfy the physical constraint of a conserved current , but beyond that it will ensure that if the process at hand will be used as a subprocess for another , larger reaction , it will _ automatically _ provide the correct contribution to make the larger process gauge invariant as well .    in this respect , we draw attention to the fact that the reaction dynamics depicted by the first four diagrams on the right - hand side of fig .

    "@xcite in the description of the kvi data are kept at the same values , @xmath243 and @xmath244 , despite the fact that they had been determined at the much lower incident energy of 190 mev . in principle , of course , these parameters may be functions of the incident energy .",
    "we see that the agreement is very reasonable .",
    "the influence of the @xmath59-resonance contribution is relatively small but significant and definitely helps to improve the agreement with the data .",
    "this is in line with the earlier findings of refs",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the present results are of comparable quality to the earlier results @xcite in reproducing the triumf data , indicating that , unlike for the high - precision kvi data at small proton scattering angles @xcite , the generalized four - point contact current  required to maintain the gauge invariance of the full bremsstrahlung amplitude  is apparently not that critical .",
    "the dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : dxsc ] correspond to the results when the generalized four - point contact current is switched off .",
    "as one can see , its effect is visible but somewhat smaller than the effect of the @xmath59 contribution .",
    "overall , however , apart from the differences in reaction energies and scattering - angle configurations , we note that the triumf data are much less precise than the kvi data , thus making the assessment of how relevant various theoretical contributions are in reproducing the data much less conclusive .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ay ] , we show our results for the analyzing power together with the triumf data at @xmath235 and @xmath245 .",
    "the agreement is reasonable given the uncertainties in the data .",
    "again , the @xmath59-resonance current helps improve the agreement with the data .    in summary , therefore , our results for the triumf data at a proton incident energy of 280 mev are in agreement with the findings of the previous studies @xcite .",
    "we point out , however , that our results are obtained within a fully gauge - invariant framework .",
    "moreover , one may hope that inclusion of the @xmath59-box contributions may further improve the agreement .",
    "we have presented a complete , rigorous formulation of the @xmath0 bremsstrahlung reaction based on a relativistic field - theory approach in which the photon is coupled in all possible ways to the underlying two - nucleon @xmath14-matrix obtained from the corresponding covariant bethe - salpeter - type @xmath0 scattering equation using the gauge - derivative procedure of haberzettl  @xcite .",
    "the resulting bremsstrahlung amplitude is unitary as a matter of course and it satisfies full local gauge invariance as dictated by the generalized ward - takahashi identity . the novel feature of this approach is the consistent  i.e. , gauge - invariant  incorporation of interaction currents resulting from the photon coupling internally to interacting hadronic systems .",
    "the formalism is quite readily adapted to approximations and thus can be applied even in cases where the microscopic dynamical structure of the underlying interacting hadronic systems is either not known in detail or too complex to be treated in detail .",
    "we have pointed out how the interaction currents resulting from the photon being attached to nucleon - nucleon - meson vertices can be treated by phenomenological four - point contact currents that preserve gauge invariance following the approach of haberzettl , nakayama , and krewald @xcite . in an advance application of the present formalism @xcite ,",
    "such interaction currents had been shown to contribute significantly to reproducing the high - precision proton - proton bremsstrahlung data at 190 mev obtained at kvi @xcite , thus removing a longstanding discrepancy between theory and experiment .",
    "in addition , we have provided a scheme that permits the approximate treatment of current contributions resulting from pieces of the @xmath0 interaction that can not be incorporated exactly . in each case",
    ", the approximation procedure ensures gauge invariance of the entire bremsstrahlung amplitude .",
    "we have also discussed the necessary modifications when taking into account baryonic states other than the nucleon @xmath1 ; in detail , we consider the @xmath2 resonance by incorporating the couplings of the @xmath0 to the @xmath3 and @xmath4 systems , and the @xmath246 transitions .    the formalism has been applied to the 280-mev bremsstrahlung data from triumf @xcite and we find good agreement with the data similar to what was obtained by other authors .",
    "we emphasize , however , that our results obey full gauge invariance , whereas previous approaches provide a conserved current only in the soft - photon approximation .",
    "since the gauge - invariant incorporation of intermediate @xmath3 and @xmath4 configurations is too demanding technically at present , the only @xmath59 degrees of freedom employed in this calculation have been the @xmath6-transition currents .",
    "finally , we emphasize that despite its completeness and generality , the present approach is quite flexible and amenable to approximations , as discussed in secs .",
    "[ subsec : singlemeson ] and [ sec : phenintcurrent ] .",
    "we expect , therefore , that it will also be useful in the on - going investigation of hard bremsstrahlung @xcite , as well as in di - lepton production processes @xcite where the photon is virtual .      for the present application",
    ", we construct the basic production current @xmath48 in the framework of a covariant three - dimensional blankenbecler - sugar reduction  @xcite ( see also ref .",
