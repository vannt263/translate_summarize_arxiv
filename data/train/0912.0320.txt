    "the reduced one - particle probability density ( henceforth density _ tout court _ ) in a gas of identical interacting particles in an external confining potential carries a wealth of information . for example , the linear response of the density to a driving field is related to density - density correlations and the excitation spectrum of the system . by continuity , the density evolution sets the total current through an arbitrary open surface across a finite system driven out of equilibrium , giving access to transport properties , or across a closed surface , giving access to transfer processes out of a chosen volume .",
    "the density determines the generalized mean forces on macroscopic degrees of freedom , with which the gas interacts , and hence the coupled dynamics of the two subsystems .",
    "in fact , the theorems of time - dependent ( td ) density - functional theory ( dft ) prove that , given an initial many - body state , the td density contains in principle the expectations of _ all _ observables of the interacting system , evolving under a td scalar potential . following ( the much older ) ground - state dft  @xcite ,",
    "tddft calculations operate by constructing a fictitious system of non - interacting electrons , evolving under another td scalar potential , such that the fictitious system reproduces the electron density of the interacting system .",
    "tddft thus provides access to the properties of the interacting system via the much more tractable corresponding non - interacting problem . in recent years",
    ", tddft has become a central tool for a range of problems involving departures from the electronic ground state ( gs ) .",
    "most applications are in the linear - response regime , calculating the electronic excitation spectra and response of atoms , molecules , solids , even biomolecules , exposed to external fields  @xcite .",
    "real - time electron dynamics in strong fields have also been studied , including electron transfer processes and transport , ionization , high - harmonic generation , and coupled non - adiabatic electron - nuclear dynamics  @xcite .",
    "tddft is based on two distinct results .",
    "the first is that , under a given particle interaction @xmath0 and for a given initial many - body state @xmath1 , there is a 1:1 correspondence between the ensuing evolution of the density and the external potential acting on the system .",
    "this is the runge - gross theorem ( rg )  @xcite .",
    "it implies that the potential and all other properties of the system are _ functionals _ of the density and initial state , and practical calculations hope to approximate some of these functionals accurately .",
    "the second result is that for every density @xmath2 , evolving from a given initial state @xmath1 under a given particle interaction @xmath0 and external potential @xmath3 , there exists an external potential @xmath4 that returns the same density , @xmath2 , under another particle interaction @xmath5 ( the key case of interest being @xmath6 ) , starting from , in general , another initial state @xmath7 ( so long as the two initial states share the same @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) .",
    "this result is van leeuwen s @xmath10-representability theorem ( vl )  @xcite , later extended to td current dft  @xcite .",
    "it means that , by contrast with gs dft , there is no doubt about the existence of a ks system , i.e. a set of non - interacting electrons whose td density matches that of the interacting system .",
    "the @xmath10-representability difficulty is lessened in the td case because the td schr \" odinger equation ( tdse ) is first - order in time , and the dependence on the initial wavefunction takes care of a large part of the difficulties associated with @xmath10-representability .",
    "the first result has been proven for potentials that are analytic in time about the initial time ( henceforth denoted @xmath11-analytic ) , i.e. such that @xmath3 is equal to its taylor series expansion in @xmath11 about the initial time , for a finite time interval .",
    "the second assumes @xmath11-analytic potentials _ and _ densities .",
    "there are also two extensions of rg in the linear - response regime that go beyond these analyticity requirements . in the first  @xcite ,",
    "the short - time density response to `` small '' but arbitrary potentials has been shown to be unique under two assumptions : that the system starts from a stationary state ( not necessarily the gs ) of the initial hamiltonian and that the corresponding linear density - response function is @xmath11-analytic . in the second  @xcite , uniqueness of the linear density response , starting from the electronic gs , was proven for any laplace - transformable ( in time ) potential .",
    "as most physical potentials have finite laplace transforms , this represents a significant widening of the class of potentials for which a 1:1 mapping can be established in the linear - response regime , from an initial gs ; this includes e.g. potentials turning on as @xmath12 with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , or @xmath15 with @xmath16 positive non - integer .",
    "it covers most cases of physical interest , under these conditions .",
    "the tdse is a coupled partial differential equation , which inextricably links analyticity properties in space and time .",
    "thus potentials and initial wavefunctions that are ( or could be ) standard examples in textbooks , in which the potential or the initial wavefunction has some non - analytic properties in space , yield densities that are not analytic in time .",
    "we demonstrate this with several examples in the last part of this paper .",
    "this implies that the assumptions underlying vl are more restrictive than they may first appear . in this paper",
    "we build on the foundational work in refs .",
    "@xcite on the problems of uniqueness and existence in tddft .",
    "our goal is to extend the fundamental framework laid there , by suggesting a simultaneous formulation of these two problems , which overcomes the requirement that the potential or density be analytic in time .",
    "this formulation is close to ( but different from ) several problems whose solutions have been proven to exist mathematically .",
    "we relate the one - to - one mappings to the existence and uniqueness of solutions to a particular type of non - linear tdse ( nlse ) .",
    "while there has been a considerable amount of work on the nlse  @xcite , the particular non - linear structure we have here has not been investigated before , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "we do not give a general solution to this problem , but discuss the features of the equation in relation to other nlses in the literature .",
    "as the existence of solutions of the latter do not require @xmath11-analyticity , this suggests that the reformulation will be a useful tool for exploring the limitations ( or extensions ) of our knowledge of the domain of the runge - gross functional .    in section",
    "ii , we carefully introduce our reformulation .",
    "we explore some consequences of the reformulation and what is known about solutions to the nlse that we find .",
    "section iii turns to the motivation behind this endeavor , with the aid of simple examples where the density evolution under @xmath11-analytic potentials is non - analytic in time .",
    "it is straightforward to see that , for a given initial state @xmath1 for a system of @xmath17 electrons , a given _ state_-evolution , @xmath18 , can be generated by at most one td scalar potential @xmath3 , as follows from tdse | ( t ) = ( t)| ( t ) = ( + + ( t))| ( t ) [ eq : tdse ] as long as the wavefunction @xmath19 is non - vanishing on a dense set of values of its arguments . here ,",
    "@xmath20 , @xmath0 and @xmath21 are the many - electron operators for the total kinetic energy , the electron - electron interaction ( with @xmath22 corresponding to non - interacting electrons ) and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "that no two distinct @xmath23 s can generate the same @xmath18 , up to a physically irrelevant purely time - dependent phase , can be shown by assuming otherwise , inserting into tdse , and finding @xmath24 , a physically irrelevant purely time - dependent constant .",
    "what rg proves is the much stronger statement that not only the states must be different , but also their one - particle densities , n(,t ) = ( t ) |()| ( t ) n _ ( , t ) , [ density ] must differ , under the restriction that the potentials considered are analytic around @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath26 is the number - density operator for the system of @xmath17 electrons with position operators @xmath27 .",
    "this restriction means that potentials that switch on at @xmath28 like @xmath12 , @xmath15 with @xmath16 non - integer , or @xmath29 are not covered by the proof .",
    "( note that the first example is infinitely differentiable , with vanishing derivatives at @xmath25 , while higher - order derivatives of the second and third types diverge as @xmath30 ) .",
    "these potentials are laplace - transformable in @xmath11 , and in the linear - response regime starting from the gs are covered by the vl extension of rg  @xcite .    here , we formulate ( but do not prove ) a 1:1 mapping defined via the existence and uniqueness properties of the solution to a system of coupled equations . differentiating the continuity equation ( @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the current density ) once with respect to @xmath11 gives  @xcite = _ ( , t ) + [ ( t)](,t ) , [ sl0 ] where [ ( t)](,t ) = ( t ) | [ ( ) , t+w ] | ( t ) [ a ] with @xmath33 the current - density operator  @xcite .",
    "we now choose a given _ prescribed _",
    "density , which we denote by @xmath34 , and a given initial many - electron state @xmath1 , such that @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "we then ask , does a potential @xmath3 exist , such that the density it generates via eqs .",

    "the restriction to nodeless densities is in practice a minor one as most densities of @xmath17-electron systems do not have nodes ; but it certainly excludes a small subset of them , and excludes typical td and excited - state densities of one - electron systems .",

    "while the initial - value problem for many classes of partial differential equations is known to have a unique solution , to our knowledge , there are no results yet for equations of the form  ( [ eq : dvsldt ] ) .    instead",
    ", we consider a reformulation of the coupled equations ( [ sl ] ) and ( [ tdse ] ) as a nlse with non - local potential term , i.e. the potential at @xmath46 depends on the wavefunction not just at or near @xmath46 but further away too .",

    "@xcite . problem ( b ) is absent in the simplified case of periodic boundary conditions , and smoothing over coulomb singularities deals with problem ( a ) ( as would be relevant for solid - state calculations using pseudo - potentials with a smoothed - out interaction term ) .",

    "part of the motivation for this paper is the hope that the further analysis of this problem in mathematical physics will stimulate future work .",
