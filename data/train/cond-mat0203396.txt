    "dynamic light scattering has proven to be a powerful tool for investigating the dynamics of colloidal suspensions , emulsions , foams , and other complex fluids . over the past decade ,",
    "dynamic light scattering ( dls ) has been increasingly applied to glassy systems with slow , and often non - ergodic , dynamics .",
    "slow dynamics pose experimental difficulties for dls , particularly with respect to the stability of the lasers , and sometimes for the light detection system .",
    "nonergodic samples pose even more serious experimental difficulties , which are exacerbated by the presence of slow dynamics .",
    "one way of addressing the problem of long data acquisition times is to use an array detector .",
    "more importantly , an array detector can also address the problem of non - ergodic samples if the optics are designed so that the different elements in the array detector constitute essentially statistically independent samplings of the system under study .    in this article",
    ", we describe a method which employs a charge - coupled device ( ccd ) array detector for performing dynamic light scattering on systems that exhibit strong multiple light scattering .",
    "while the basic method we describe is applicable to single as well as multiple light scattering , our focus here is on multiple dynamic light scattering , also known as diffusing - wave spectroscopy ( dws )  @xcite , where the methods we describe are most effective .",
    "in conventional dws ( or dls ) , the basic idea is to illuminate a sample with a coherent beam of light from a laser and to measure the temporal fluctuations in the resulting speckle pattern of scattered light . in a typical experiment ,",
    "the optics for collecting the scattered light is arranged in such a way that the intensity of a single speckle is measured . by focusing on a single speckle ,",
    "the amplitude of the fluctuating intensity is optimized to obtain a strongly fluctuating signal .",
    "the temporal duration of a typical fluctuation , _ i.e. _  the lifetime of a speckle , is determined by the time it takes a particle to move such that the phase of the scattered light is changed by approximately unity ( or @xmath0 ) .",
    "the dynamics of the scattered light , and hence the dynamics of the scatterers , can be more quantitatively characterized by the temporal autocorrelation function of the scattered intensity . in many cases ,",
    "the autocorrelation function can be analyzed so that the time dependent mean square displacement of the scatterers is extracted  @xcite",
    ".    there are two important keys to the success of the conventional analysis that we wish to focus on here .",
    "first , the process must be stationary , at least for the duration of the experiment .",
    "that is , the dynamics of the system can not change significantly during this time period .",
    "for example , the gelation process of a colloidal suspension can be monitored provided that the particle dynamics slow down ( due to the increase of the elastic modulus ) occurs on time scales longer than the measurement period . in general an accurate measurement of the correlation function",
    "requires that the fluctuations in the intensity be measured over many fluctuation periods ( _ e.g. _  @xmath1 speckle lifetimes to achieve @xmath2% accuracy ) .",
    "thus , in this case , the particle dynamics must not change significantly over a time period of @xmath3 speckle lifetimes .",
    "second , the system must be ergodic . for a light scattering experiment ,",
    "a system is ergodic if each speckle samples the same distribution of light intensities as the entire ensemble of speckles over the period of time that data is acquired ( _ i.e. _  over the duration of the experiment ) . while this condition is satisfied for a large number of systems , there are certain systems with very slow glassy dynamics that are of interest but which , nevertheless , are not ergodic in the sense described above .",
    "such systems pose a problem for light scattering and special steps must be taken in order to assure that meaningful correlation functions , which represent dynamics characteristic of the entire system , are measured  @xcite .",
    "the problem for light scattering presented by nonergodic samples was first understood in a clear fashion by pusey and van  megen who , at the same time , presented a clever method of obtaining correctly averaged temporal autocorrelation functions  @xcite .",
    "this technique has proven to be very useful but has some drawbacks : it sacrifices some signal - to - noise in order to obtain a useful distribution of light intensities , and the dynamics of the system must not change significantly over the duration of the experiment  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it suffers from the same limitation as normal dls experiments in that data must be collected over a time scale that is much longer that the longest time scale of the fluctuations one is trying to measure .",
    "other schemes have been developed which overcome some of these difficulties , but not without a significant cost . the sample can be translated or rotated , for example , so that an ensemble average is obtained by brute force  @xcite .",
    "however , the rotation or translation introduces an artificial characteristic time scale into the correlation function , namely the time scale over which the system samples new speckles by virtue of the motion .",
    "care must be taken to assure that this time scale is much longer than any dynamical time scale of the system one is interested in measuring . and",
    "once again , the duration of the experiment must be such that averaging occurs over a time scale that is long compared to the time scale introduced by the sample motion ( this amounts to assuring that a sufficiently large number of speckles are sampled  _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath1  to obtain the desired level of accuracy ",
    "_ e.g. _  @xmath4 ) .",
    "another method , developed recently by scheffold _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , uses two cells , one containing the sample with the slow nonergodic dynamics that is being studied , and another containing diffusing particles with ergodic dynamics , which serves to spatially average the nonergodic signal .",
    "this technique is only useful for experiments involving strong multiple scattering , but nevertheless provides a simple and efficient means of dealing with nonergodic systems .",
    "however , the only time scales probed in the primary cell are those that are shorter than the diffusive time scale set by the secondary cell .",
    "an attractive alternative to the techniques described above for dealing with nonergodic samples is to use a ccd array , conveniently contained in a commercial ccd camera , as a light detector  @xcite .",
    "this allows the intensity from a large number of speckles to be simultaneously and independently measured .",
    "a time series of images of scattered light obtained from the ccd camera are stored in a computer and processed such that each pixel in the ccd array serves as an input to its own correlator .",
    "since the fluctuation of each speckle is independent of the other speckles , processing scattered intensity data collected with a ccd camera is like have @xmath5 independent samplings of the data , where @xmath5 is the number of speckles in the field of the ccd array .",
    "if @xmath5 is sufficiently large , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath6 , then a complete ensemble average is obtained without any need to sample the system over times any longer than the actual dynamical time scales that are under study .",
    "thus , a direct ensemble average can be obtained without any need for time - averaging whatsoever .",
    "this approach solves several problems at once .",
    "first , it solves the nonergodicity problem because a full ensemble average ( of @xmath1 samples ) is obtained .",
    "second , the process under study need not be a stationary process because no time averaging is necessary , provided a sufficiently large number of speckles are used .",
    "thus , an essentially instantaneous snapshot of the system dynamics can be taken .",
    "if those dynamics change in time , they can be followed simply by measuring temporal autocorrelation functions at different starting times .",
    "there are two practical limitations of the ccd - camera - based technique .",
    "first , the minimum delay time for which the correlation function can be measured is set by the frame rate of the camera . in the experiments described in this article",
    ", we use a frame rate of 500 frames per second .",
    "thus , delay times as small as a few milliseconds are accessible .",
    "it is interesting and important to note that real time processing of the images is necessary since , to our knowledge , no commercial buffer memory is able to store them for the entire sequence of frames obtained in the course of a single experiment , which is typically on the order of @xmath7 to @xmath8 frames .",
    "recent advances in microprocessor speed allows real time computation of the correlation function .",
    "hence the limiting factor for frame rate is the pci bus velocity for transferring data from the acquisition board to the computer ram .",
    "the second limitation of the technique is the limited sensitivity of the ccd array used , as compared to that of a photomultiplier .",
    "this means that relatively strong scattered light signals are needed . in practice a power of 400 mw gives a satisfactory signal to noise ratio for a frame rate of 500 per seconds .",
    "in this article we first describe the ccd optical set up and calculational scheme for our computer - based correlator . in the next section",
    "we explain how a single camera can be used to take up to 500 correlation functions simultaneously , with the reference starting time shifted by different amounts .",
    "we then show how the ccd camera technique can be coupled with the double cell technique to extend the time window over which measurements can be made from 10@xmath9  s to 10@xmath10  s.",
    "the sample is illuminated using polarized light from an argon - ion laser operating at a wavelength of @xmath11  nm . its maximal output power is 1.6 watts .",
    "the laser beam is expanded to a diameter of approximately 1  cm and is incident on the sample cell , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dessinmontage ] .",
    "multiply scattered light is collected by a 50-mm nikon camera lens and focused onto a iris diaphragm .",
    "the lens is set up so that a one - to - one image of the scattered light from the output plane of the sample cell is formed on the diaphragm .",
    "the imaging of the output plane of the sample onto the pinhole provides a convenient means for collecting data from different parts of the sample .",
    "this feature is particularly useful in samples like gels or very viscous solutions where defects or small particles of dust may hinder the measurement ; this set - up allows one to avoid defected regions of the sample .",
    "a polarizing cube is placed between the lens and the diaphragm to protect the camera from stray light .",
    "the low sensitivity of ccd arrays relative to photomultiplier tubes means that the sample must be strongly illuminated .",
    "however , the incident light intensity must not be so high as to heat the sample .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to collect as much scattered light as possible .",
    "we use a camera lens of 50  mm with a numerical aperture of 1.7 .",
    "the scattered light is detected by a dalsa ccd camera , model cad1 - 128a , which is placed approximately @xmath12  cm behind the diaphragm .",
    "it is an 8-bit camera which we run at 500 frames per second .",
    "the images are transferred to a computer running at 500  mhz using a national instruments data acquisition board , model pci1422 .",
    "the combined speeds of the computer and data acquisition boards are sufficiently high to allow data to be analyzed in real time .",
    "data analysis includes calculation of the ensemble - averaged temporal correlation function of the scattering intensity @xmath13 , @xmath14 and the ensemble - averaged spatial correlation function @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the time when the reference intensity is measured , @xmath17 ) is the delay time , @xmath18 is the coordinate of a pixel on the detector , and @xmath19 is the coordinate of another pixel a distance @xmath20 away .",

    "the algorithms used to calculate these correlation functions are described in greater detail below .",
    "we use a dalsa camera running at 500 frames / sec and a 500-mhz pc.,width=302 ]      the size @xmath22 of the speckles of scattered light formed on the ccd chip is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the distance between the diaphragm and the ccd chip , @xmath25 is the wavelength of light , and @xmath26 is the diameter of the diaphragm . by adjusting @xmath24 and/or @xmath26 , the size of the speckles relative to the size of a pixel on the ccd chip can be controlled .",
    "we use a 2  mm @xmath27 2  mm ccd chip with @xmath28 pixels .",
    "each pixel occupies approximately @xmath29 with a 100% fill factor .    to maximize the signal - to - noise",
    ", we need to collect data from as many speckles of scattered light as possible .",
    "however , if the speckles are too small , for example if several speckles occupy a single pixel , optical contrast is lost and the signal for determining a temporal autocorrelation function @xmath30 is degraded . therefore , it is important to adjust the speckle size so that we obtain a satisfactory optical contrast with as much speckles as possible analyzed .    in order to determine the number of speckles per pixel , we adjust the collection optics ( _ i.e. _  the size of the iris ) and measure the spatial intensity autocorrelation function @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the intensity of scattered light at pixel @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the intensity of light @xmath35 pixels away .",

    "note that @xmath36 first decreases and then oscillates about a baseline intensity .",
    "we arbitrarily define the position of the first minimum to be the average speckle size .",
    "hence the speckle size is defined as the distance over which the intensity profile remains spatially correlated .",
    "obtained using different speckle sizes .",

    "the frit is sufficiently opaque that diffusion approximation for light transport through the medium is valid .",
    "the intercept for the intensity correlation function ( _ i.e. _  @xmath37 ) is expected to lie between 1 and 2 . in order",
    "to quantitatively evaluate its value , a series of 2000 intercepts was measured .",
    "measurements were performed by self - correlating 2000 images from the glass frit . for each image",
    "the mean intensity was calculated as well as the mean squared intensity .",
    "the ratio of theses two quantities corresponds to @xmath38 for this image .",

    "figure [ fig : statpix](a ) shows the six distributions of @xmath37 .",

    "figure [ fig : statpix](b ) shows that the best configuration is obtained for a speckle size of 3 pixels in diameter .",
    "all subsequent measurements are performed in this configuration .",

    "in this section we explain how the bitmapped image is processed to calculate the autocorrelation function .      at time @xmath49 , a single ccd frame of scattered light is saved in the computer memory ( ram ) .",
    "we call @xmath50 the raw intensity of the light incident on pixel @xmath33 for the image taken at time @xmath49 , and subtract off an average background @xmath51 for pixel @xmath33 due to stray light and dark counts : @xmath52 we measure @xmath51 by averaging 1000 images for each pixel with the laser turned off .",
    "further refinements taking into account other sources of extraneous signal can be found in  @xcite .",
    "while such refinements prove useful for dls in the single scattering limit , we found that such corrections to be insignificant for dws .",
    "one practical problem encountered in acquiring data is that some images may be skipped by the acquisition card due to synchronization problems .",

    "when data is taken from an ergodic system , both methods give the same result , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : camerapm ] where we compare correlation functions obtained from a ccd camera to one taken with a conventional single detector - single correlator for a sample of polystyrene beads in glycerol obtained undergoing brownian motion .",
    "significant advantages accrue for the ccd technique , however , when measurements are performed on a non - ergodic sample .",
    "moreover , the ccd method can provide important advantages when measuring correlation functions for non - ergodic systems .      in the preceding section",
    ", we discussed how a two - time correlation function @xmath61 can be obtained , @xmath16 being the time at which the reference image is acquired and @xmath55 being a later time at which another image is collected and correlated with the reference .",
    "such a correlation function provides a snapshot of the dynamical state of the system at a particular starting time , namely @xmath16 , and is possible only because sufficient ensemble averaging is achieved by correlating thousands of pixels between two frames from a ccd camera .",
    "the ability to obtain such snapshots is particularly useful for studying systems whose dynamics are time - dependent , _ i.e. _  non - stationary systems",
    ". examples include systems which are gelling , coarsening , aging , or undergoing some other non - equilibrium non - stationary process . by measuring @xmath62 as a function of the starting time @xmath16",
    ", the evolving dynamics of such systems can be followed and studied .    here",
    ", we explain a scheme for following the evolving dynamics of a system by measuring many different correlation functions in parallel , each with a different starting time @xmath16 .",
    "a unique and important feature of this scheme is that new correlation functions can be started at intervals as short as 1/500  s , while still collecting frames for correlation functions started at earlier times .",
    "in fact , up to 500 correlation functions can be collected simultaneously , each with a different starting time @xmath16 , and without any requirement that a previously started correlation function be finished before starting a new one .",
    "the key to the success of the scheme is the realization that in most cases , it is not necessary to measure the correlation function with the same temporal resolution for all delay times . typically , small time steps are required for short delay times while larger time steps are required for longer delay times .",
    "the scheme we employ takes advantage of this fact .",
    "it is essentially an interlacing scheme in which successive frames are sometimes used in different correlation functions , as will be explained below . in effect",
    ", the scheme represents a compromise between making maximal use of the information available in the measurements for calculating the correlation functions and obtaining and processing the data from the ccd camera frames at a rapid rate .",
    "this compromise is necessary because calculating the correlation function between two frames is time consuming ; only one pair of frames can be processed ( multiplied and averaged ) between the acquisition of two successive images .",
    "image stacking is not practical because it quickly leads to memory overflow .",
    "therefore , we employ an algorithm for calculating many correlation functions , labeled by @xmath63 , simultaneously in real time , that makes only the following manageable demands on the computer :    * only one frame multiplication is performed between the acquisition of successive frames , * storage of a maximum of @xmath64 reference image frames plus the most recently acquired frame in memory , and * storage of a maximum of @xmath65 correlation functions in memory , each with on the order of 100 channels .        for a frame rate of 500 frames",
    "/ s from a @xmath28 pixel ccd camera , these demands can be met by a computer with a pentium processor running at 500  mhz and possessing 512  mb of ram .",
    "an important feature of the algorithm is that it requires that only the reference frame for each correlation function , along with most recently acquired frame , be stored in the computer at any moment in time ; this keeps the number of frames that must be stored in memory to a manageable number .",
    "this also allows all correlation functions to be calculated in real time as the experiment proceeds .",
    "the scheme we use is illustrated graphically in fig .",
    "[ fig : multicorrprinc ] . the vertical axis represents the different correlation functions labeled by @xmath63 .",
    "the horizontal axis represents the successive frames that are acquired , labeled @xmath66 with each frame being nominally separated in time by the reciprocal @xmath67 of the frame rate . the reference image for the @xmath68 correlation function",
    "is given by image number @xmath69 where the subscript  1 \" indicates that this is the first frame of the @xmath70 correlation function .",
    "each of these reference images is stored in memory ; @xmath5 is typically of order 10 .",
    "the reference image and the next @xmath71 images in sequence are correlated with the reference image .",
    "the remaining frames used to calculate the @xmath68 consists of a sequence of selected images as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : multicorrprinc ] .",
    "the sequence numbers of the frames used to calculate the @xmath68 correlation function is summarized by the formula :    @xmath72    note that the spacing between the points in a correlation function is constant over the first @xmath5 points but increases quadratically at later times .",
    "the time interval between two successive correlation functions @xmath73 and @xmath74 is approximately @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the frame rate .",
    "this time interval can be tuned in order to best accommodate the rate of evolution of the system under study .",
    "for @xmath77 this time interval can be as short as the inverse frame rate .",
    "taken after a shear step of @xmath78 .",

    "[ fig : relaxation ] we show a series of correlation functions obtained using the multispeckle ccd camera technique described above .",

    "the first correlation function was started at a time @xmath81 immediately after a step strain of 5% was applied to the sample .",
    "thus , the correlation functions measure the subsequent random motion of the beads that arises as a response to the stress within the sample .",
    "as the stress relaxes over the course of tens of minutes , the random motion of the beads becomes slower .",

    "many materials , including polymer networks , colloidal gels , and glassy materials possess two characteristic ranges of relaxation times , where only the slower of the two is sufficiently slow for the multispeckle ccd camera method to work . in these cases ,",
    "the faster relaxation processes are not measured .    to illustrate such a process",

    "[ fig : campart ] . as the gelatin gels , the motion of the strands of gelatin and the motion of the spheres embedded within it becomes increasingly restricted . as the gelation proceeds , the height of the plateau and the @xmath89-intercept of the correlation functions increases .",

    "the rise of the intercept and plateau corresponds to the disappearance of the fast liquid phase relaxation process and concurrent increase of the gel elastic modulus.,width=302 ]    what we would like to be able to do is to _ simultaneously _ capture the fast and slow dynamics for a time - dependent non - stationary process .",

    "the key is to properly ensemble average the scattered light signal entering the photomultiplier used with the fast correlator without disturbing the multispeckle signal that enters the slow correlator .    to provide an ensemble - averaged signal to the fast correlator",

    "@xcite , which enables simple and efficient spatial averaging without requiring any motion of the sample or the detector .",
    "this technique is known as the _ two - cell _ technique and has been described both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "the idea of the two - cell technique is to optically couple the studied sample to an ergodic reference system",
    ". the light is successively scattered by the sample cell and then by the reference cell before entering the photomultiplier .",
    "this can be implemented simply by illuminating two cells in series , and detecting the light that passes through and is scattered by both samples in the two cells . in that case , the non - ergodic signal emerging from the sample cell is made ergodic by its scattering through the reference cell .",
    "the second cell can thus be regarded as performing a slow spatial averaging of the sample signal . under carefully specified optical conditions ,",
    "the correlation function , @xmath96 measured after passing through the two cells is simply the product of the correlation function of each cell : @xmath97 where the superscripts @xmath98 and @xmath99 stand for the sample and the reference correlation functions , respectively .",
    "the conditions under which the two - cell technique can be employed have been carefully considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . they find that the primary condition required is that each photon traverses the space between the sample and reference cells only once .",
    "this means that for a configuration where a significative amount of light is lost between the two cells , as was done in ref .",

    "figure [ fig : dessinmontage2 ] illustrates how we incorporate the two - cell technique into the multispeckle correlator so that we can simultaneously capture the fast and slow dynamics from a slowly evolving non - ergodic system .",
    "we arrange the optics for the multispeckle ( slow ) correlator just as before so that surface from which the multiply scattered light exits the sample cell is imaged with a 1:1 ratio onto a pinhole behind which the ccd camera is placed . for the fast correlator , a non - polarizing beam splitter is placed a short distance in front of the pinhole so that half of the light is diverted onto the reference cell . the reference cell positioned so that the exit plane of the sample cell is imaged onto the reference cell s front surface .",
    "an single mode optical fiber with a collimator collects the scattered light exiting the reference cell at an angle of approximately @xmath105 and sends it to a photomultiplier whose output is connected to a multiple - sample - time correlator .",
    "the reference cell has a thickness of 5  mm and contains a glycerol solution of 0.5  @xmath106m - radius latex spheres with a volume fraction of @xmath107 .",
    "the concentration of spheres is chosen so that there is just enough multiple scattering in the reference cell to ensure that essentially no light passes through the sample without being scattered at least several times but with @xmath108 as big as possible . however , this must be done so that the decorrelation time of the reference correlation function is somewhat larger , typically by a factor of about 3 to 10 , than the inverse frame rate of the ccd camera . by adjusting the concentration of spheres and the viscosity of the solution with glycerol , these conditions are readily achieved .",
    "before a measurement can be made using the two - cell technique , it is necessary to measure the correlation function of the reference cell in the absence of the sample cell and to ensure that its correlation time is greater than the inverse frame rate .",
    "data from such a measurement is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : proof ] , from which one can see that the decay time of @xmath109 is about 0.1  s. the correlation function @xmath110 is then measured with the sample cell in place , from which the sample correlation function @xmath111 is obtained using eq .",
    "( [ eq : g2cell ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : proof ] shows results from a typical set of measurements , including the reference cell correlation function @xmath112 , the measured two - cell correlation function @xmath110 , and the true correlation function of the sample @xmath111 obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : g2cell ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath111 is obtained accurately from the first time measured by the correlator , about @xmath113  s , out to about 30  ms , or approximately the decorrelation time of @xmath109 . for longer delay times",
    ", the reference correlation function @xmath109 falls to zero making recovery of @xmath111 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : g2cell ] ) impossible .",
    "note that the sample correlation function @xmath114 determined in this way has a significant time interval of overlap , from about 2  ms to about 30  ms , with the correlation function measured by the multispeckle technique .",
    "thus , it should be possible to superimpose the correlation functions from the two techniques to obtain a single correlation function covering the entire range of time scales from 10  ns to hundreds of seconds or longer .",
    "it is important to note , however , that in order from the signal to be ergodic the correlation function obtained from the two - cell technique to be properly ensemble averaged , data must be collected over a time that is about @xmath115 times larger than the decay time of the reference correlation function . in our case",
    "the acquisition time is 100  s.     [ @xmath116 , @xmath117 [ @xmath118 @xmath119 [ @xmath120 for the gelatine gel after 210 min . the sample correlation function @xmath119 displays first a rapid decay and then a plateau due to the trapping of the beads in the gel network.,width=302 ]      in order to overlay the correlation functions measured by the two techniques , they must be properly normalized using the respective siegert coefficients @xmath121 for each measurement ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : siegert ] ) . for the multispeckle ccd camera method , @xmath122 , as discussed in section [ sec : spklsz ] . for the double cell technique ,",
    "@xmath121 is determined by the value of the intercept from the correlation function of the reference cell alone . for the reference cell ,",
    "we obtain @xmath123 .",
    "figure [ fig : overlay ] shows correlation functions from the two techniques for the gelation experiment described in section [ sec : fastandslow ] .",
    "the acquisition time for each double cell measurement was 100  s. excellent agreement is obtained over the range where the two techniques overlap ( 2  ms-30  ms ) . note that the overlap occurs in a region where the slope of the correlation function is sizeable , making the agreement even more impressive .",
    "finally , it us useful to compare the results for different methods of measuring a correlation function . in fig .",
    "[ fig : verif ] , we plot three correlation functions : ( 1 ) one obtained using the multispeckle technique with a window of decay times of 2  ms10  s. averaging was performed in real time ( up to the longest decay time or @xmath125  s ) ; ( 2 ) another obtained using the double cell technique over the decay - time window of @xmath113s30  ms and averaged for 100  s ; ( 3 ) and a third obtained using a classical set - up with a photomultiplier tube and single correlator over the decay - time window of @xmath126  s and averaged for 3000  s. the measurements using the double cell and the multispeckle methods were done simultaneously ; the measurement with the photomultiplier and single correlator was performed just after the other two , simply by removing the reference cell .",
    "the agreement is very good over the time window of @xmath113-@xmath127  s. there are deviations , however , between the single correlator and the multispeckle techniques at longer delay times .",
    "these deviations occur because data obtained using the single correlator technique must be collected over a fairly long data - acquisition time , 100  s in this case , in order to obtain satisfactory signal - to - noise . in cases where the dynamics of the sample evolves with time , the multispeckle technique has clear advantages .    ] , with a reference cell ( two - cell method  100  s ) [ square ] , and using multispeckle ccd camera ( 10  s ) [ @xmath128 techniques .",
    "discrepancies at long time at are attributed to poor statistics for the the conventional method.,width=302 ]    the multi - speckle technique can measure correlation functions in real time for delay - times larger than 2  ms . when coupled simultaneously ( in the same set - up ) with the two - cell technique , the combined method can measure correlation functions over an extremely broad range of delay times . as a demonstration , we show in fig .

    "correlation function spans a range of delay times from 10@xmath133 to greater than 10@xmath134  s , or more than 11 decades in time .",
    "such a measurement is not only remarkable , it is extremely useful for probing glassy systems which can exhibit dynamics over a vary broad range of delay times .     for a suspension of silica spheres ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "the fast part of the correlation function was measured using the two - cell technique and the slow part using the multispeckle technique .",
    "the combined measurements span 11 decades.,width=302 ]    lastly , there are a couple of practical constraints that bear mentioning .",
    "first , the two techniques can be usefully coupled only if the typical time scale over which the system evolves is much longer than the averaging time required for the two cell technique . as a practical matter , the required averaging time",
    "is set by the longest delay time one wishes to measure .",
    "that time is determined primarily by the desire to have some range of delay times where the two - cell and multi - speckle techniques overlap .",
    "the limitation here is the speed of the camera that can be used for the multi - speckle technique .",
    "second , the simultaneous use of the two techniques leads to a certain amount of light loss .",
