    "the standard model of particle physics provides a solid foundation from which physical phenomena of strong and electroweak nature  from high - energy scattering to atomic and molecular structure  can be successfully described .",
    "the standard model itself does not predict precise values of fundamental constants such as the fine structure constant @xmath6 or the electron - to - proton mass ratio @xmath7 , but rather accepts the experimentally observed values as input parameters to the physical theory .",
    "speculative theories which go beyond the standard model , such as string theories , suggest that these constants may vary in time or space @xcite , enticing both theorists and experimentalists alike to contrive favorable means for detecting variations of these constants .",
    "one method for determining variations  or limitations on variations  in @xmath1 and @xmath2 is from analysis of atomic or molecular absorption lines originating from interstellar space .",
    "comparison with laboratory spectra can , in principle , reveal variations on cosmological time or distance scales . employing this method ,",
    "groups have reported evidence for non - zero variations in both @xmath1 @xcite and @xmath2 @xcite , though other analyses have shown no variation at similar levels of accuracy @xcite ( see also comment @xcite ) .",
    "complementary to the astrophysical studies , terrestrial experiments probe @xmath1- and @xmath2-variation on much smaller time and distance scales , but benefit from the high - precision and reproducibility that the spectroscopic experiments offer . given in terms of temporal drift ,",
    "laboratory experiments have placed stringent , model - free constraints on variations of both @xmath1  @xcite and @xmath2  @xcite : @xmath8 with the dot signifying a derivation with respect to time .",
    "both the astrophysical and laboratory methods may realize significant gains by utilizing atomic or molecular species which have enhanced sensitivity to @xmath1- and @xmath2-variation .",
    "much theoretical effort has been dedicated to identifying such systems , with a general strategy being to locate accidental near - degeneracies within energy spectra . in this spirit , measurements have been proposed for multiply - charged ions @xcite , diatomic @xcite and more complex @xcite molecules , and even nuclei @xcite . note that `` near - degeneracy '' is a relative term here ; for example , the ground and anomalously low - lying excited state of the @xmath9th nucleus ",
    "being separated by an interval of 7.6 ev @xcite  are nearly - degenerate relative to the typical energy scale of nuclear excitation ( @xmath10 kev ) .    the relative sensitivity to @xmath1- and @xmath2-variation for a given transition",
    "may be parameterized in terms of dimensionless coefficients @xmath11 and @xmath12 , defined by the relation @xmath13 with @xmath14 being the transition energy .",
    "`` typical '' transitions have sensitivity coefficients on order of unity or less .",
    "for example , in a diatomic molecule a typical fine structure transition has @xmath15 , @xmath16 , while a typical vibrational transition has @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "near - degeneracies resulting from a cancellation between fine structure and vibrational intervals can , however , lead to transitions with sensitivity coefficients orders of magnitude larger than unity  @xcite .",
    "several atomic , molecular , or nuclear transitions which enjoy large enhancement , however , may be irrelevant for astrophysical studies or may prove unfavorable for spectroscopic experiments , and therefore may be of limited utility .",
    "in this paper we consider the molecular ion nh@xmath0 as a candidate for measuring variation in @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "nh@xmath0 possesses an accidental near - degeneracy between its ground ( @xmath19 ) and first excited ( @xmath20 ) electronic states , these being separated by only a few hundred @xmath4 ( for scale , the next electronic state is @xmath21 higher  @xcite ) .",
    "as we will show , this near - degeneracy results in enhanced sensitivity coefficients of order 10100 for a number of transitions within the rotational spectrum .",
    "moreover , nh@xmath0 is a light molecule which has been suggested to be a component in interstellar clouds  @xcite , though to - date it has not been detected in such media  @xcite .",
    "further still , motivated by the search for an electron electric dipole moment , leanhardt  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have argued that high precision spectroscopy may be performed on molecular ions within a paul trap , with experiments now underway for hff@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "these considerations suggest that nh@xmath0 could serve as a valuable probe of @xmath1- and @xmath2-variation in future astrophysical or laboratory studies .",
    "the rotational spectrum of nh@xmath0 was analyzed experimentally in some detail several years ago by kawaguchi and amano  @xcite and more recently by hbers  _ et al . _",
    "both papers tabulate molecular parameters which , together with the appropriate effective hamiltonian , are capable of furnishing the rotational spectrum .",
    "evolution of the spectrum with respect to @xmath1- and @xmath2-variation may be determined so long as the the scaling of the molecular parameters with respect to @xmath1 and @xmath2 is known .",

    "this close proximity of @xmath5 and @xmath3 states allows for sizable coupling between the two via spin - orbit interaction .",

    "agree to within a few percent following both references .",
    "this agreement , however , deteriorates for a handful of the transitions , with these transitions tending to be the ones with the largest @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the bulk of the discrepancy in these cases can be attributed to a difference in @xmath14 [ i.e. , the denominator of eq .  (",

    "direct measurement of the transition energies can remove this uncertainty , provided that the sensitivity coefficients are corrected appropriately , @xmath168 with this prescription , theoretical uncertainty is then due to calculated @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",

    "@xcite is typically more than 1-@xmath171 , even after the disparity in effective hamiltonians is accounted for  @xcite ) .",
    "the notable exclusion is the relativistic electronic contribution to the term energy .",

    "the dominant decay channels are the rotational transitions @xmath179 .",
    "as the rotational splitting @xmath180 grows with @xmath181 , so too does the natural linewidth . for large @xmath181 , where the hund s case ` b ' limit is realized",

    ", we find @xmath190 for the @xmath5 state and @xmath191 for the @xmath3 state . assuming practical limitations @xmath192 , depending on statistics , we conclude that the natural linewidth should allow measurement of the transition energies at the required level of precision .    to summarize",

    "we find enhanced sensitivity for a number of low - frequency transitions within both the @xmath46 and @xmath47 spectra , having sensitivity coefficients on the order of @xmath160 .",
    "the enhanced sensitivity for these transitions is attributed to the near degeneracy of the ground @xmath19 and excited @xmath20 electronic states and the significant spin - orbit coupling between them .",
