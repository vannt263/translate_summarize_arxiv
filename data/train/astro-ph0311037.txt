    "black hole x  ray binaries appear to evolve through a continuous range of states whose general properties strongly depend mainly on the relative contribution and interplay between two main spectral components , i.e. a soft thermal disc component and a hard non  thermal power law component . in some cases",

    "high frequency variability at about 250  hz ( and also likely at 250@xmath0 2/3 hz ) has also been detected @xcite .",
    "if the 250  hz oscillation is interpreted as the orbital frequency at the innermost stable circular orbit , one can obtain a mass estimate of 8.2 m@xmath1 for a non  rotating black hole .",
    "if a rotating black hole is considered , the black hole mass could well be much higher .    _ xmm  newton _ observations close to the peak of the outburst in the very high state revealed the presence of a broad and asymmetric fe emission line suggesting that the black hole in xte  j1650500 is rapidly rotating @xcite .",

    "some feature is present in the mecs data below 2.5  kev , independently of the spectral model that is used to analyse the data .",

    "to better constrain the continuum and to assess the relevance of reflection components in the spectra , we then added the pds data in the range 13200  kev .",

    "we first analysed the mecs data by considering the `` standard '' model for galactic black hole candidates x  ray sources , i.e. a multicolour accretion disc blackbody ( mcd ) from mitsuda et al .",
    "( 1984 ) and a power law , modified by absorption in the interstellar medium ( the model in ) .",
    "the fit is very poor for the first two observations ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively ) and better for obs .",
    "3 ( @xmath5 ) for 156 degrees of freedom .",
    "the main reason for the low quality of the fits is the presence of large residuals in the region of the fe complex , above 3.54  kev .",
    "the shape of the residuals strongly suggest the presence of a broad and asymmetric fe emission line in the three observations .",
    "we then describe the 2.510  kev mecs data by adding the model to account for relativistic iron line emission from an accretion disc around a kerr black hole . in this model ,",
    "the emissivity profile on the accretion disc is described by a power law of the form @xmath6 , where the emissivity index @xmath7 is a free parameter of the model .",
    "after some testing , the inclination was fixed to 45 degrees ( as in miller et al .",
    "2002 ) as the data indicate clear preference for intermediate inclinations .",
    "the outer disc radius was fixed to its maximum possible value of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the black hole mass . the inner disc radius , the emissivity index , the rest energy of the emission line , and the model normalisation were let free to vary during the fit . a smeared edge ( )",

    "however , some positive residuals are still found in the fe line band , suggesting the presence of an emission feature around 5  kev .",
    "we then added a narrow gaussian ( with fixed zero width ) and we detected emission features at @xmath14  kev in obs .  1 and at @xmath15  kev in obs .  2 and 3 .",
    "the narrow line ew is small ( less than 20  ev ) , but its inclusion in the model improves the statistic ( @xmath16 depending on the observation with two less degrees of freedom ) . its possible origin is discussed below .",

    "xmm  newton _ by miller et al .",

    "2 and 3 indicates a high level ionisation , while in obs .",
    "1 it suggests emission from less ionised iron . the emissivity profile on the accretion disc is well described by a steep power law with index @xmath20 .",
    "this steep emissivity is consistent with previous measurements with _",
    "xmm  newton _",
    "@xcite and strongly suggests that the accretion disc is illuminated by a centrally concentrated source of primary hard x  rays that strongly irradiates the inner disc region .",
    "the fe emission line profile indicates emission from an accretion disc extending down to about @xmath21 .",
    "such a small inner disc radius is not consistent with a non  rotating schwarzschild black hole if the accretion disc is assumed to extend down to the marginal stable orbit ( @xmath22 for a schwarzschild black hole ) . on the other hand ,",
    "since the marginal stable orbit for a maximally rotating kerr black hole has a radius of about @xmath23 , the data suggest the presence of a central rapidly rotating kerr black hole .",
    "however , the measure of an inner disc radius smaller than @xmath22 does not necessary mean that the black hole must be spinning .",
    "indeed , reynolds & begelman ( 1997 ) showed that the line profile from an accretion disc around a schwarzschild black hole can be very similar to the one computed in the kerr spacetime , if emission within the marginal stable orbit is considered ( but see young , ross & fabian 1998 ) .",
    "as discussed above , a narrow emission line at @xmath24  kev is formally required in obs .  1 , while the line energy is @xmath25  kev in obs .  2 and 3 .",
    "although the measured ew is low , these features worth a brief comment .",
    "more than a single interpretation is of course possible both as emission around 5.25.4  kev or as absorption at slightly higher energies ( for a similar feature in ngc  3516 see nandra et al .",
    "narrow emission lines with @xmath26  kev are also seen in active galaxies ( e.g. turner et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 ; guainazzi 2003 ; yaqoob et al . 2003 ; doviak et al .",
    "the 5.25.4  kev features in xte  j1650500 could part of the main broad relativistic line . if , as it is likely , the emissivity on the disc is more complex than a simple power law , it is possible that some small features of the line profile are not well described by the model .",
    "redshifted iron emission from an outflow , absorption due to resonant scattering in infalling material , or spallation of iron producing a fluorescent cr emission line ( skibo 1997 ) provide other interesting possibilities .",
    "on the other hand , since the fe line profile is very broad , an explanation in terms of emission from the inner accreting flow seems likely .",
    "it ispossible that the observed features are due to redshifted fe k@xmath27 emission line from the accretion disc , superimposed to the main broad fe line component . as an example",
    ", a strong flare originating very close to the disc surface will illuminate only a very small region of the disc .",
    "the emissivity profile would thus comprise two components , a power law emissivity due to the illumination of the whole disc by the corona emission ( producing the broad fe line ) and a small bump at the radius where the flare is active .",
    "if this is the case , we would mainly observe the blue horn of the emission line associated with the flare , the red wing being faint and confused with that of the main broad fe line component .",
    "we tested this possibility by replacing the narrow gaussian with a second line with energy and inclination tied to that of the main component and found results comparable to those reported in table  1 if the 5.2 - 5.4  kev line comes from a narrow ring around 23  @xmath28 .",
    "since the quality of the data does not allow to distinguish between the different possibilities , we will not discuss them any further .",
    "we however include in our modelling a gaussian emission line with fixed zero width at 5.2 - 5.4  kev , depending on the observation .      in order to better constrain the fe line parameters , a careful analysis of the underlaying continuum",
    "is necessary .",
    "it is clear that a power law and a model are simple , and probably too rough , approximations to the hard spectral shape . in particular",
    ", the presence of the fe line strongly suggests that a reflection continuum due to reprocessing of the primary x ",
    "rays by the accretion disc , is present in the data .",
    "the 2.510  kev energy band is too limited to constrain the reflection continuum , and for this reason we consider the high energy data from the pds instrument as well ( in the range 13200  kev ) .",
    "we also add some low energy data ( 1.5 to 3  kev ) from the lecs instrument , to better constrain the thermal component of the spectrum . at lower energies , some absorption / emission features are visible . we decide to ignore these features in this analysis that is focused on the fe complex and does not benefit much from the data below 1.5  kev .",
    "the extension of the previous model ( ) to the 1.5200  kev band does not provide a very good description to the data .",
    "the main reason is the presence of spectral curvature and positive residuals above 20  kev .",
    "the shape of the residuals suggests the presence of a compton hump due to a reflection component .",
    "because of the presence of these residuals and of the relativistic fe emission line , and anticipating the presence of a ionised disc as suggested by the fe line rest energies ( see table  1 ) , we add a reflection component ( , from magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) to our model , and remove the phenomenological model .",
    "moreover , as all the components emitted from the accretion disc should be affected by the same relativistic effects , the reflection component , the thermal disc black body component and a narrow ( i.e. with fixed zero width ) gaussian emission line are relativistically `` blurred '' by convolving it with the core of the model .",
    "the width of the gaussian emission line is fixed to zero because the fe line profile is dictated by the effects of the relativistic blurring ; our description of the fe emission line is completely equivalent to the one provided by the model .",
    "the incident continuum is described by a power law with high energy cutoff ; the photon index , cutoff energy and normalisation are tied to those of the model .",
    "we also include a ( non  blurred ) narrow emission line to model the features at @xmath29  kev , as discussed in the 2.510  kev analysis .",
    "all abundances in the reflection model were fixed to solar values while the relative normalisation between incident power law and reflection ( the relative reflection @xmath30 ) was let free to vary during the fit .",
    "the outer disc radius was fixed at 400  @xmath28 and the inclination at 45 degrees , as before .",
    "we notice also that the same model was used by miller et al .",
    "2002 to describe the september 13 _ xmm  newton _ data .",
    "hereafter we shall refer to this model as .",
    "this model works well on the data of obs .",
    "2 and 3 ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively ) but a reasonable fit can be obtained for obs .  1 only up to about 60  kev ( @xmath33 ) . in obs .  1",
    "a sharp feature is detected around @xmath34  kev in the pds data and is most likely instrumental .",
    "if the associated energy band is ignored in fitting the spectrum , the statistics is much better ( @xmath35 ) and fit parameters are unaffected .",
    "however , the main problem for obs .",
    "1 is that , if higher energy data above @xmath36  kev are included , fails to give an appropriate description of the spectrum .",
    "we shall report now our results with , restricting the energy band to 1.560  kev for obs .  1 , and discuss later in some detail the broadband spectrum for this first observation .",
    "the results of the fits with are reported in table  2 .",
    "we measure an increase in the photon index from @xmath37 in obs .  1 to @xmath38 in obs",
    ".  2 and 3 which is consistent with the general trend obtained by rossi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) from the analysis of _ rxte _ observations during the same outburst , and an inner black body temperature of @xmath39  kev .",
    "the data support the presence of a reflection component that contributes significantly to the hard flux , especially during obs .  2 and 3 where the reflection fraction @xmath30 is significantly greater than unity :",
    "the trend is of increasing @xmath30 with time , from obs .  1 ( @xmath40 ) to obs .  2 ( @xmath41 ) and 3 ( @xmath42 )",
    "the large values of the relative reflection measured in obs .  2 and 3 indicate that the accretion disc is viewing more illuminating radiation than we actually detect in the power law component .",
    "the surface disc temperature and the ionisation parameter ( @xmath43 ) of the reflection model vary in the range @xmath44  k and @xmath45  erg  cm / s , respectively . although these values are not well constrained by the data a trend of increasing @xmath43 from obs .",
    "1 to 3 . is observed ( see table  2 ) . since the x  ray flux decreases from obs  1 to 3 ( see section  4 and table  3 ) this indicates that the ionisation parameter is not correlated with flux . a possible explanation for the behaviour of r and @xmath43 is given in section  4 .    once again , the most relevant results concern the broad iron emission line . in all observations ,",
    "the line emission is consistent with the disc extending down to about 2 gravitational radii suggesting the presence of a rapidly rotating kerr black hole . replacing the kernel with the one which describes a non  rotating schwarzschild black hole , and fixing the inner disc radius at @xmath22 results in a worse description of the spectra ( the smallest variation is @xmath46 with one more degree of freedom in obs .  3 , while the largest occurs in obs .  1 with @xmath47 ) .",
    "we stress again that @xmath48 is measured not only through the iron line but is the result of the fit on all the components that are thought to originate from the accretion disc that are blurred with relativistic effects , so that the significance of the measured @xmath48 is , in our opinion , enhanced .",
    "the model ( lacking comptonisation ) predicts too sharp an edge at high levels of ionisation and could thus require extreme relativistic blurring at high ionisation to smooth it out .",
    "however , the measured @xmath7 and @xmath48 do not show any trend toward extreme values as the ionisation parameter increases from obs .  1 to 3 by nearly one order of magnitude",
    ", so that we are confident about the robustness of our results . the emissivity index and the inner disc radius are both consistent with being constant from obs .",
    "1 to 3 .",
    "the line ew is about 200  ev , depending on the observation and it is smaller than in the analysis of the 2.510  kev data ( see table .  1 ) .",
    "this is mainly due to the non negligible contribution of the ionised reflection continuum in the fe line region .",
    "the emissivity profile of the disc is quite steep ( @xmath49 ) suggesting that the iron line emission is concentrated in the inner regions of the accretion disc .",
    "summarising , our results confirm the evidence for the presence of a kerr black hole rotating close to its maximum possible angular momentum ( @xmath50 ) in xte  j1650500 as shown in the _ xmm  newton _ observation by miller et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , although other interpretations may still be viable @xcite . as an example , the broadband 1.5200  kev spectrum of obs .  2",
    "is shown in fig .  2 :",
    "the model is fitted ignoring the fe line energy band between 4 and 8  kev .",
    "this energy range is then re  inserted to show the residuals in the fe line region .",
    "as already mentioned , does not provide a good description of obs .  1 if data above 60  kev are included in the analysis .",
    "the reason of the failure is clearly shown in fig .  3 , where we show the pds spectrum when the 1.560  kev best fit model for obs .  1 is extended up to 200  kev . the data in obs .",
    "1 clearly require a sharper cutoff above 60  kev than the one provided by the exponentially decaying power law and reflection .",
    "even if the high energy cutoff of the and models is forced to assume low values , a reasonable fit can not be found .",
    "the sharp cutoff is most likely the sign of a comptonised continuum which is only roughly approximated by the exponentially cutoff power law . for simplicity , we describe the sharp break with a simple phenomenological model replacing the model with a , i.e. assuming a broken power law illuminating spectrum .",
    "the model provides a reasonable description to the broadband spectrum of the first _",
    "bepposax _ observation",
    "( with @xmath51 ) without changing the results of the 1.560  kev analysis reported in table  2 .",
    "the difference is the presence of a break energy at about 70  kev where the photon index changes . above that energy , the photon index steepens from @xmath52 to @xmath53 . as before , ignoring the pds sharp feature energy band around 35  kev gives a much better fit with @xmath54 .",
    "the spectral break is not visible in obs .  2 and 3 probably because of the lower signal to noise ratio in the pds data that does not allow to constrain the shape above 60  kev well enough .",
    "in this section , we investigate the correlations between the power law component ( plc ) that illuminates the accretion disc and the reprocessed reflection dominated component ( rdc ) , i.e. reflection continuum and the iron line .    in the three observations , we observe that the contribution of the black body component to the total flux gradually increases with time , while the plc contribution shows the opposite trend .",
    "the 1.5200  kev flux of the black body component increases by about one order of magnitude , while the plc flux decreases by an even larger amount ( see table  3 ) . as already mentioned , the relative reflection @xmath30 increases by about a factor 3 as the plc decreases from obs .  1 to 3",
    ", suggesting that @xmath30 is anti  correlated with the plc flux .",
    "our results are difficult to explain in the framework of the standard view of reflection models because any rdc emitted from the accretion disc is expected to respond to changes in the illuminating flux ( the plc ) , so that @xmath30 should remain constant as the plc flux changes . however , this picture is probably oversimplified and fails ( for example ) to account for the variability of the seyfert 1 galaxy mcg6 - 30 - 15 . as already pointed out by miller et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , this agn exhibits some clear similarities with xte  j1650500 .",
    "in particular , it is characterised by an extremely broad iron emission line ( strongly suggesting the presence of a kerr black hole ) and a steep emissivity profile @xcite .",
    "mcg6 - 30 - 15 exhibits also a peculiar variability behaviour : in its normal states the spectral variability can be accounted for by a phenomenological model comprising a plc that varies in normalisation and an almost constant rdc ( and iron line ) @xcite . in low flux states , the iron line is correlated with the plc @xcite .",
    "this behaviour has been successfully reproduced in terms of a light bending model in which general relativistic effects strongly affect the emission in the near vicinity of the central kerr black hole @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the light bending model is that the plc variability is mostly due to changes in the height of a centrally concentrated primary source of hard x ",
    "rays above the accretion disc rather than to changes in its intrinsic luminosity .",
    "if the source height is small ( few gravitational radii ) , most of the radiation is bent onto the accretion disc by the strong gravitational field of the central black hole : this strongly reduces the observed plc at infinity and enhances the illumination of the disc .",
    "the fe line ( and any rdc ) varies with much smaller amplitude than the plc and different regimes can be identified in which the line is correlated with the plc , almost constant , or anti  correlated with the plc .",
    "these regimes correspond to low , medium and high plc flux states .",
    "a major prediction of the model is that the hard spectrum becomes more and more reflection dominated as the plc drops ( i.e. as the height of the primary source decreases ) so that the relative reflection @xmath30 increases as the system goes into low plc flux states .",
    "large values of the relative reflection are naturally expected in low plc flux states .",
    "thus , if the plc variability can be accounted for by light bending , the increase of the relative reflection ( and its large value ) as the plc flux drops from obs .  1 to 3 can be understood . moreover , as the source height decreases and the plc drops , the inner regions of disc are more and more illuminated , so that a reasonable expectation is that the ionisation parameter of the disc increases .",
    "this may explain the trend of increasing ionisation parameter from obs .  1 to 3 ( see table  2 ) .",
    "the model predicts that the fe line flux is correlated with the plc in low flux states , while it is almost constant in higher flux states .",
    "furthermore , the fe line ew should correlate with the reflection fraction , or in other words , the ew computed with respect to the reflection continuum only ( ew@xmath55 ) is predicted be roughly constant because , as in any reflection model , fe line and rdc are expected to vary together . on the other hand , since the fe line is predicted to vary much less than the plc , the ew computed with respect to the plc only ( ew@xmath56 ) should be anti  correlated with the plc and saturate only at low fluxes where fe line and power law component are correlated .    as a test of the model , we then measure the fe line flux , the plc flux , ew@xmath55 , and ew@xmath56 .",
    "results are shown in table  3 and fig .",
    "[ corr ] : as predicted by the light bending model , the fe line appears to be correlated with the plc in low flux states and to saturate at higher flux levels ( top panel of fig .",
    "[ corr ] ) .",
    "moreover , ew@xmath55 is almost constant , while ew@xmath56 is anti  correlated with the plc flux and possibly saturates at very low plc flux , in excellent agreement with the model ( middle panel ) .",
    "as already mentioned , the relative reflection r is anti  correlated with the plc flux ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ corr ] ) .    clearly , three observations are not enough to establish correlations properties with high level of significance . however ,",
    "the behaviour of the iron line flux with respect to the plc flux in xte  j1650500 has been also measured with _ rxte _ during the same 2001/2002 outburst and results are reported by rossi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) where 176 pointed observations are discussed .",
    "the observed fe  line  vs.  plc behaviour is remarkably similar to our present results and to the predictions of the light bending model ( see e.g. figure 5 of rossi et al . 2003 and",
    "figure 2 of miniutti & fabian 2004 ) .",
    "of course , this does not mean that light bending is really at work in this source and that other models can not explain the correlation properties .",
    "however , the strong similarity between theoretical predictions and observational data is manifest .",
    "we present a broadband spectral analysis of the bhc xte  j1650500 during its 2001/2001 outburst . the three _ bepposax _ observations cover about 25 days starting from 2001 september 11 , only a few days after the peak of the outburst .",

    "( 2002a ) during the very high state on 2001",
    "september 13 .",
    "the fe line profile we observe strongly suggests that the accretion disc extends down to @xmath57 , well within the limit of marginal stability for a non  rotating schwarzschild black hole , thus indicating that xte  j1650500 harbours a rapidly rotating ( possibly maximally rotating ) kerr black hole .    the fe line emission",
    "is consistently associated with a strong reflection spectral component from the accretion disc .",
    "the reflection dominated spectrum is also distorted by the special and general relativistic effects in the vicinity of the central black hole in the same way as the fe line .",
    "the emissivity profile of the disc seems to be steeper than expected from standard disc models ( @xmath58 ) suggesting that the primary source that illuminates the disc is centrally concentrated .    from the first to the third observation , the power law component of the spectrum drops by more than one order of magnitude . in the same time , the relative reflection increases by a factor 3 , suggesting that the spectrum becomes more and more reflection dominated as the power law flux decreases .",
    "we interpret this behaviour in terms of a light bending model for the variability of x  ray sources that has been presented elsewhere ( see miniutti et al 2003 , 2004 ) .",
    "the variability of the fe line flux and ew is also consistent with the predictions of this model and with previous observations ( rossi et al . 2003 ) .",
