    "globular clusters ( gcs ) provide a unique laboratory for investigating the formation and evolution of their host galaxies .",
    "the form of the mass spectrum for gcs is nearly identical to the mass function of the parent molecular cloud cores @xcite .",
    "the brightness distribution of gcs , known as globular cluster luminosity function ( gclf ) , can be used to constrain possibilities for gc formation and destruction ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .    by virtue of the natural advantage of being located at a reasonable distance , nearby galaxies ( especially m31 )",
    "offer us an ideal environment for detailed studies of cluster systems .",
    "a large number of gcs have been identified in m31 since @xcite , and the latest revised bologna catalog of m31 gcs and candidates ( hereafter rbc v.5 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is a compilation of photometry and identifications from many previous catalogs , published 625 confirmed gcs and 331 gc candidates . based on the growing number and updated sample of m31 gcs and candidates , many works have probe the gclf in m31 in detail .",
    "@xcite found that the mean luminosity of gcs in m31 decreases markedly with increasing galactocentric distance , indicating that clusters with larger projected distances are fainter than those closer to the nucleus @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained distance moduli to m31 and m87 from gclf by applying the corrections for dynamical evolution , and found surprising consistency of the predicted and observed distances , which confirmed the gclf as a distance indicator .",
    "these authors also concluded that the mass functions of gcs in the milky way ( mw ) , m31 , and m87 were universal at the birth of these systems , although spanning a wide range of masses .",
    "@xcite measured the lf for m31 gcs , and found that inner clusters have a gclf peak brighter than the outer ones , while the metal - rich ( mr ) clusters are brighter than their metal - poor ( mp ) counterparts .",
    "the variation in the m31 gclf seems to be due to various factors : metallicity , age , cluster initial mass function ( imf ) , and dynamical destruction @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite compared the gclfs of the mw , m31 , and the sculptor group spiral galaxies , and found that the gclf of the mw is consistent with that of m31 .    near - infrared ( nir ) colors can help to distinguish among star formation histories and imfs @xcite .",
    "the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) , performed between 1997 june and 2001 february , covers 99.998% of the celestial sphere in the @xmath9 ( 1.25 @xmath10 m ) , @xmath11 ( 1.65 @xmath10 m ) , and @xmath12 ( 2.16 @xmath10 m ) bandpasses @xcite .",
    "these observations were conducted with two 1.3 m diameter telescopes located at arizona and chile .",
    "the 2mass all - sky data release contains the observation of m31 with an integration time of 7.8 s for each exposure , while a new 2.8 deg@xmath13 nir survey from the 2mass 6x program across the extent of the optical disk of m31 , with an exposure time of 6 times the normal exposure , provides a clearer view of the galaxy center .",
    "@xcite identified 693 known and candidate gcs in m31 using the 2mass database , and derived their 2mass @xmath0 magnitudes . after adding the mean difference between the 2mass photometry and previous nir photometry ,",
    "the newly assembled nir dataset were implemented into a revised version of bologna catalog .",
    "these authors also showed that the @xmath14 color provides a powerful tool to discriminate between m31 clusters and background galaxies .",
    "@xcite presented 2mass photometry and color for a sample of local group clusters younger than @xmath15100 myr , and found that the embedded clusters , which are heavily obscured by dust , generally have a redder @xmath16 color than older ones , from which gas and dust have already been ejected .",
    "these authors also concluded that the brightest clusters can be split into young and old subsamples from @xmath16 color . considering that a more extended and homogenous photometry in the nir is important for the studies on m31 star clusters",
    ", we would carry out new photometry for them using 2mass images .    in this paper , we provide nir photometry for a set of star clusters in m31 using images from 2mass .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the sample selection , @xmath0 photometry , and comparisons with previous measurements .",
    "a discussion on the properties of the sample clusters will be given in section 3 , including the gclf and color distributions .",
    "finally , we will summarize our results in section 4 .",
    "we selected our sample gcs and candidates from rbc v.5 , which contains precise cluster coordinates , classifications , metallicities , reddening values , radial velocities , galactocentric distances , structure parameters , and photometry including _ galex _ ( fuv and nuv ) , optical broad - band , and 2mass nir magnitudes for 2060 objects .",
    "however , rbc v.5 provided @xmath0 magnitudes in three bands only for @xmath151100 objects . in addition , there were no magnitude errors for @xmath0 bands in rbc v.5 . therefore , homogeneous photometric data and precise magnitude errors for @xmath0 bands are urgently needed .",
    "we selected classes 1 , 2 , 3 , and 8 from column ` f ' in rbc v.5 , which include gcs , candidate gcs , controversial objects , and extended clusters .",
    "this resulted in an initial selection of 991 objects .",
    "we first employed iraf / daofind to find the sources in the images and matched them to the coordinates of these objects given by rbc v.5 , and then checked each object visually in the images to confirm the positions for the photometry . during this process",
    ", we found that there are 68 clusters for which accurate photometric measurements can not be obtained with different reasons . some clusters ( b024d , b053d , b061d , b523 , b537 , bh16 , m023 , sk068b , sk110a ) are superimposed onto a bright or strongly variable background .",
    "some clusters ( b102d , hec2 , mcec4 ) are very faint and the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) is low .",
    "some clusters ( b189d , b246 , b274 , b538 , bh09 , bh25 , c011 , c041 , khm31 - 77 , m050 , m065 , m075 , m078 , nb89 , sk059b , sk061a , sk063c , sk097b , sk104b , sk153c ) are very close to other objects . some clusters ( b016d , b088d , b530 , bh01 , bh03 , bh04 , bh28 , dao93 , h20 , hec6 , hec9 , hec13 , khm31 - 345 , m055 , m079 , nb17 , sh06 , sk049a , sk222c , sk216b , sk223b , sk242b ) are indiscernible with the coordinates presented by rbc v.5 in the 2mass images .",
    "there is one or two nearby objects within 2@xmath154 pixels for five clusters ( b016d , b530 , m055 , sh06 , sk223b ) of them , however , after careful comparison with the images from local group survey ( lgs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and from digitized sky survey ( dss ) , these objects can not be confirmed due to their low s / n values .",
    "in addition , we found that some clusters ( b196d , b257d , b318 , b368 , b453 , b475 , g099 , khm31 - 85 , m056 , m068 , m088 , m089 , sk166b , v031 ) have one or more nearby bright objects in the images from lgs or from wide field planetary camera on _ hubble space telescope _ , indicating that they are `` adhered '' in 2mass images because of the poor resolution .",
    "@xcite presented @xmath0 photometry , ages , and masses for 10 newly - discovered halo gcs in m31 .",
    "so , we will not re - estimated @xmath0 magnitudes for these gcs .",
    "finally , here we will derive nir photometry for the remaining 913 star clusters and cluster candidates .",
    "the position of cluster h26 presented by rbc v.5 may be of insufficient accuracy , with r.a . and decl .",
    "being 00:59:27.37 and + 37:41:34.1 @xcite .",
    "we checked the images from 2mass and from dss , and corrected the coordinate to 00:59:27.48 and + 37:41:31.37 .",
    "the updated position was then used for the following photometry .",
    "figure 1 shows the spatial distribution of the sample clusters in m31 .",
    "we used the 2mass archival images of m31 in the @xmath0 bands to do photometry .",
    "the images were retrieved using the 2mass batch image service .",
    "considering that the 2mass-6x images , which were observed with 6 times the normal exposure of 7.8 s , have a deeper magnitude limit and a higher s / n than the all - sky release survey images , the 2mass-6x data were preferred . in this paper ,",
    "photometry for 627 objects were performed using the 2mass-6x data , while photometry for the rest 286 ones were done using the all - sky release survey data .",
    "the uncompressed atlas images provided were used , with a resampled spatial resolution of @xmath15@xmath17 pixel@xmath18 .",
    "we performed aperture photometry of the 913 m31 star clusters in all of the @xmath0 bands to provide a comprehensive and homogeneous photometric catalog for them .",
    "the photometry routine we used is iraf / daophot @xcite .    to determine the total luminosity of each object",
    ", we produced a curve of growth from @xmath9-band photometry obtained through apertures with radii in the range of 4 - 16 pixel with 1 pixel increments .",
    "the most appropriate photometric radius from the curve that encloses the total cluster light but excludes lights from extraneous field stars were adopted .",
    "in addition , we checked the images of all the three bands for each cluster by visual examination to make sure that the photometric aperture was not so large as to be contaminated by other sources .",
    "the local sky background was measured in an annulus with an inner radius 1 pixel larger than the photometric radius and 5 pixels wide .",
    "the sky fitting algorithm was set to `` mode '' .",
    "the derived magnitudes with large uncertainties ( @xmath19 mag ) were abandoned here to keep high photometry precision .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes were then calibrated using the relevant zero points obtained from the photometric header keywords of each image .",
    "figure 2 shows the aperture distribution as a function of @xmath9-band magnitude , with a highest peak at @xmath20 .",
    "in general , magnitudes of brighter objects are measured with larger apertures .    finally , except for 9 objects in the @xmath9 band , 31 objects in the @xmath11 band , and 51 objects in the @xmath12 band , we obtained photometry for 913 star clusters in the individual @xmath0 bands .",
    "table 1 lists our new @xmath0 magnitudes and the aperture radii used , in conjunction with the magnitude uncertainties given by daophot .",
    "figure 3 shows the uncertainty distribution as a function of magnitude for the @xmath0 bands .",
    "filled circles represent photometry performed on the 2mass-6x images , while red pluses represent photometry performed on the 2mass all - sky images .",
    "it is clear that the photometry from 2mass-6x data show smaller magnitude uncertainties , which are due to high s / n with longer exposures .",
    "objects in these dashed boxes are bright sources with slightly large magnitude uncertainties ( @xmath21 mag ) .",
    "six clusters ( au008 , au010 , b132 , nb21 , nb39 , nb41 ) have large magnitude uncertainties in all three bands , two clusters ( b070 , b119 ) have large magnitude uncertainties in @xmath12 band , two clusters ( b104 , nb108 ) have large magnitude uncertainties in @xmath22 bands , and three clusters ( b264 , b324 , sk050a ) have large magnitude uncertainties in @xmath23 bands .",
    "all these clusters are close to the galaxy center and suffer from a bright background contamination .      to examine the quality and reliability of our photometry , we compared the aperture magnitudes of the 913 objects obtained here with previous results , in the sense of values from this paper minus values from the others .",
    "figure 4 and figure 5 plot the comparison of our obtained 2mass photometry with the aperture photometry from 2mass catalog , with @xmath24 for the point source catalog ( psc ) and @xmath25 for the extended source catalog ( xsc ) following @xcite . the 2mass psc was derived by combining the 2mass all - sky psc and the 2mass 6x point source working database ( 6x - pswdb ) , with the 6x - pswdb being preferred .",
    "the 2mass xsc was derived by combining the 2mass all - sky xsc and the 2mass 6x extended source working database ( 6x - xswdb ) , with the 6x - xswdb being preferred .",
    "each panel displays the mean difference ( @xmath26 ) , rms scatter ( @xmath27 ) , and the number points ( @xmath28 ) for the comparison .",
    "there were nine objects with larger offset ( @xmath29 mag ) for the comparison with psc , as listed in table 2 .",
    "it was surprised that the magnitudes of eight of these clusters were measured with an aperture of @xmath24 here , which is the same as adopted in the psc .",
    "we checked the images for these clusters and found that some clusters ( sk049c , sk054c , sk086c ) are located in a strongly variable background , while some clusters ( b038d , b104 , sk047b ) lie close to the m31 center .",
    "in addition , there is one very bright source near sk115b . for objects in the psc",
    ", the sky background is measured in an annulus with an inner radius of @xmath30 and an outer radius of @xmath31 . to check whether the discrepancy is caused by the different choice of the annulus for background",
    ", we used the same annulus with psc and re - estimated magnitudes for the eight clusters .",
    "we found that most of the newly derived magnitudes agree well with those from psc , except sk115b , and sk136c .",
    "for sk115b , about a quarter of the area of the annulus ( @xmath30-@xmath31 ) is affected by the nearby bright source , which would lead to a high estimate of the sky background . for sk136c ,",
    "the @xmath9-band magnitude given by psc is 13.419 , much brighter than the @xmath11-band magnitude 16.700 , which is suspicious .",
    "we think that the annulus set in this paper is more reasonable for these clusters .",
    "in addition , for cluster b072d , a larger radius would include lights from outer sources . in this paper , photometry",
    "was performed with an aperture radius larger than @xmath20 for more than 400 clusters , which may lead to brighter magnitudes than those in 2mass psc , on the average .",
    "we concluded that this is the main reason for the offset of the @xmath0 magnitudes ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 ) .",
    "there is no big difference between the magnitudes measured here and those from the xsc .",
    "@xcite measured @xmath35 magnitudes for a sample of m31 gcs , with most of the new nir data taken with the stelircam on the 1.2 m telescope at fred lawrence whipple observatory ( flwo ) , and the observation data for four objects from the 2mass @xcite scans of m31 .",
    "@xcite obtained nir photometry for 38 gcs and candidates from @xmath36 observation using the gemini on the lick observatory 3 m telescope and @xmath35 observation using the stelircam on the flwo 1.2 m , and updated magnitudes for some clusters studied in @xcite .",
    "figure 6 plots the comparison of our obtained 2mass photometry with the magnitudes from @xcite .",
    "the average differences for the @xmath9 and @xmath12 bands are @xmath37 and @xmath38 , which may be caused by different photometry methods , with the rms scatters around the mean being 0.193 and 0.231 .",
    "there is only one cluster ( dao69 ) with larger magnitude offsets , as listed in table 2 .",
    "a larger radius would include lights from several outer sources , so we think our photometry result is more reasonable for dao69 .",
    "figure 7 displays the comparison of our obtained 2mass photometry with the magnitudes from rbc v.5 .",
    "the 2mass photometry in rbc v.5 @xcite was derived from the 2mass all - sky psc and xsc , by correcting the systematic shifts between the magnitudes from the 2mass catalogs and previous nir photometries . in rbc v.5",
    ", the 2mass @xmath0 magnitudes were transformed to cit photometric system @xcite .",
    "however , we needed the original 2mass @xmath0 data to compare with our results , so we reversed the transformation using the equations given by @xcite .",
    "the average differences for the three bands are @xmath39 and @xmath40 , with the rms scatters around the mean being 0.309 , 0.264 and 0.327 .",
    "there is an obvious offset between their estimated @xmath9 magnitudes and ours , which is mainly caused by some large scatters listed in table 2 .",
    "if these clusters with larger offset ( @xmath29 mag ) are not included , the systematic offset in @xmath9 band can be reduced to be 0.035 mag .",
    "the clusters with the largest discrepancy are b041 , b090 , and sk054c .",
    "there are several bright sources beyond b041 , and a larger radius would include lights from these sources .",
    "the @xmath12 magnitude of b090 in rbc v.5 is 17.881 , which is from the 2mass all - sky psc .",
    "however , in the 2mass 6x - pswdb , the magnitude is 15.308 .",
    "we checked the images of the 2mass all - sky survey , and found that the low s / n is the main reason for the @xmath12 magnitude inaccuracy .",
    "the four objects with magnitude scatters larger than 2.0 mag are plotted in figure 8 , in which the circles are photometric apertures adopted here .",
    "as discussed above , the inaccuracy of the @xmath12 photometry for b090 is mainly caused by the low s / n .",
    "b104 lies close to the m31 center , while sk054c is located in a variable background .",
    "the different annulus set for the sky estimation results in the discrepancy of the magnitudes , and we think that the photometry method in this paper is more reasonable for these clusters . for sk136c , the @xmath9 magnitude in 2mass psc ( 13.419 ) , which is much brighter than @xmath11 magnitude ( 16.700 ) , may be a typing error . in all comparisons",
    "the average absolute difference is @xmath41 mag , and the rms scatter around the mean varies between 0.1 and 0.4 .",
    "no system offset between our magnitudes and previous determinations can be seen .",
    "@xcite published reddening values for a large sample of clusters in m31 by comparing the observed spectra with model ones .",
    "considering the high accuracy of their spectral results , we preferentially adopted @xcite reddening values .",

    "@xcite and @xcite determined the reddening for m31 clusters using correlations between optical and infrared colors and metallicity by defining various `` reddening - free '' parameters .",
    "because the reddening values from @xcite comprise a homogeneous data set and the number of gcs included is greater than that of @xcite , we preferentially adopted @xcite reddening values , followed by those of @xcite .",
    "finally , the results from @xcite , which derived reddening values from spectral - energy distribution fitting , were adopted .",
    "there are 378 star clusters with no available reddening values in the literatures , and we would calculate reddening values for them in a similar way as described in @xcite . for clusters with a de - projected galactocentric distance @xmath42 22 kpc ,",
    "the reddening values were measured as the mean reddening values of star clusters located within an annulus at every 2 kpc radius from the center of m31 .",
    "while for clusters beyond a de - projected distance of 22 kpc , most of which are located in halo regions , the reddening value of @xmath43 mag was adopted as @xcite suggested .",
