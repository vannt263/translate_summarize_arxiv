    "variational integrators have mainly been developed and used for a wide variety of mechanical systems . however ,",
    "real - life systems are generally not of purely mechanical character .",
    "in fact , more and more systems become multidisciplinary in the sense , that not only mechanical parts , but also electric and software subsystems are involved , resulting in mechatronic systems .",
    "since the integration of these systems with a unified simulation tool is desirable , the aim of this work is to extend the applicability of variational integrators to mechatronic systems . in particular , as the first step towards a unified simulation , we develop a variational integrator for the simulation of electric circuits .    [ [ overview ] ] overview + + + + + + + +    variational integrators @xcite are based on a discrete variational formulation of the underlying system , e.g.  based on a discrete version of hamilton s principle for conservative mechanical systems .",
    "the resulting integrators given by the discrete euler - lagrange equations are symplectic and momentum - preserving and have an excellent long - time energy behavior . choosing different variational formulations ( e.g.  hamilton , lagrange - dalembert , hamilton - pontryagin , etc . ) , variational integrators have been developed for classical conservative mechanical systems ( for an overview see @xcite ) , forced @xcite and controlled @xcite systems , constrained systems ( holonomic @xcite and nonholonomic systems @xcite ) , nonsmooth systems @xcite , stochastic systems @xcite , and multiscale systems @xcite .",
    "most of these systems share the assumption , that they are non - degenerate , i.e.  the legendre transformation of the corresponding lagrangian is a diffeomorphism . applying hamilton s principle to a regular lagrangian system , the resulting euler - lagrange equations are ordinary differential equations of second order and equivalent to hamilton s equations .",
    "the lagrangian formulation for lc circuits is based on the electric and magnetic energies in the circuit and the interconnection constraints expressed in the kirchhoff laws .",
    "there exist a large variety of different approaches for a lagrangian or hamiltonian formulation of electric circuits ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "all of theses authors treat the question of which choice of the lagrangian coordinates and derivatives is the most appropriate one .",
    "several settings have been proposed and analyzed , e.g.  a variational formulation based on capacitor charges and currents , on inductor fluxes and voltages , and a combination of both settings , as well as formulations based on linear combinations of the charges and flux linkages . typically , one wants to find a set of generalized coordinates , such that the resulting lagrangian is non - degenerate .",
    "however , within such a formulation , the variables are not easily interpretable in terms of original terms of a circuit .",
    "a recently - considered alternative formulation is based on a redundant set of coordinates resulting in a lagrangian system for which the lagrangian is degenerate . for a degenerate lagrangian system ,",
    "i.e.  the legendre transform is not invertible , the euler - lagrange equations involve additional hidden algebraic constraints .",
    "then , the equations do not have a unique solution , and additional constraints are required for unique solvability of the system . for the circuit case ,",
    "these are provided by the kirchhoff current law ( kcl ) . from a geometric point of view",
    ", the kcl provides a constraint distribution that induces a _ dirac structure _ for the degenerate system . the associated system is then denoted by an _ implicit lagrangian system_. in @xcite and @xcite , it was shown that nonholonomic mechanical systems and lc circuits as degenerate lagrangian systems can be formulated in the context of induced dirac structures and associated implicit lagrangian systems .",
    "the variational structure of an implicit lagrange system is given in the context of the hamiltonian - pontryagin - dalembert principle , as shown in @xcite .",
    "the resulting euler - lagrange equations are called the _ implicit euler - lagrange equations _",
    "@xcite , which are semi - explicit differential - algebraic equations that consist of a system of first order differential equations and an additional algebraic equation that constrains the image of the legendre transformation ( called the _ set of primary constraints _ ) .",
    "thus , the modeling of electric circuits involves both primary constraints as well as constraints coming from kirchhoff s laws . in @xcite , an extension towards the interconnection of implicit lagrange systems for electric circuits",
    "is demonstrated . for completeness",
    ", we have to mention that the corresponding notion of implicit hamiltonian systems and implicit hamiltonian equations was developed earlier by @xcite . an intrinsic hamiltonian formulation of dynamics of lc circuits as well as interconnections of dirac structures have been developed , e.g.  in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "there are only a few works dealing with the variational simulation of degenerate systems , e.g.  in @xcite , variational integrators with application to point vertices as a special case of degenerate lagrangian system are developed .",
    "although there exists a variety of different variational formulations for electric circuits , variational integrators for their simulation have not been concretely investigated and applied thus far . in @xcite ,",
    "a framework for the description of the discrete analogues of implicit lagrangian and hamiltonian systems is proposed .",
    "this framework is the foundation for the development of an integration scheme .",
    "however , no concrete simulation scenarios have yet been performed .",
    "furthermore , the discrete formulation of the variational principle is slightly different from the approach presented in this work , thus resulting in a different scheme .    [ [ contribution ] ]",
    "contribution + + + + + + + + + + + +    in this work , we present a unified variational framework for the modeling and simulation of electric circuits .",
    "the focus of our analysis is on the case of ideal linear circuit elements , consisting of inductors , capacitors , resistors and voltage sources .",
    "however , this is not a restriction of this approach , and the variational integrators can also be developed for nonlinear circuits , which is left for future work .",
    "a geometric formulation of the different possible state spaces for a circuit model is introduced .",
    "this geometric view point forms the basis for a variational formulation .",
    "rather than dealing with dirac structures , we work directly with the corresponding variational principle , where we follow the approach introduced in @xcite . when considering the dynamics of an electric circuit , one is faced with three specific situations that lead to a special treatment within the variational formulation and thus the construction of appropriate variational integrators : 1 .",
    "the system involves external ( control ) forcing through external ( controlled ) voltage sources .",
    "the system is constrained via the kirchhoff current ( kcl ) and voltage laws ( kvl ) .",
    "the lagrangian is degenerate leading to primary constraints . for the treatment of forced systems ,",
    "the lagrange - dalembert principle is the principle of choice .",
    "involving constraints , one has to consider constrained variations resulting in a constrained principle .",
    "the degeneracy requires the use of the pontryagin version ; thus , the principle of choice is the constrained _ lagrange - dalembert - pontryagin principle _ @xcite .",
    "two variational formulations are considered : first , a constrained variational formulation is introduced for which the kcl constraints are explicitly given as algebraic constraints , whereas the kvl are given by the resulting euler - lagrange equations .",
    "second , an equivalent reduced constrained variational principle is developed , for which the kcl constraints are eliminated due to a representation of the lagrangian on a reduced space . in this",
    "setting , the charges and flux linkages are the differential variables , whereas the currents play the role of algebraic variables .",
    "the number of inductors in the circuit and the circuit topology determine the degree of degeneracy of the system .",
    "for the reduced version , we show for which cases the degeneracy of the system is canceled via the kcl constraints . based on the variational formulation",
    ", a variational integrator for electric circuits can be constructed . for the case of a degenerate system ,",
    "the applicability of the variational integrator is dependent on the choice of discretization .",
    "based on the type and order of the discretization , the degeneracy of the continuous system is canceled for the resulting discrete scheme .",
    "three different integrators and their applicability to different electric circuits are investigated .",
    "the generality of a unified geometric ( and discrete ) variational formulation is advantageous for the analysis  for very complex circuits in particular .",
    "using the geometric approach , the main structure - preserving properties of the ( discrete ) lagrangian system can be derived . in particular ,",
    "good energy behavior and preservation of the spectrum of high frequencies of the solutions can be observed .",
    "furthermore , preserved momentum maps due to symmetries of the lagrangian system can be derived .",
    "going one step further , we extend the approach to a stochastic and multiscale setting . due to the variational framework",
    ", the resulting stochastic integrator will well capture the statistics of the solution ( see for instance @xcite ) , and the resulting multiscale integrator will still be variational @xcite .    [ [ outline ] ] outline + + + + + + +    in section  [ sec : elecirc ] , we first review the basic notation for electric circuits followed by a graph representation to describe the circuit topology . in addition , we introduce a geometric formulation that gives an interpretation of the different state spaces of a circuit model . based on the geometric view point , the two ( reduced and unreduced ) variational formulations are derived in section  [ sec : varcirc ] . the equivalence of both formulations as well as conditions for obtaining a non - degenerate reduced system are proven . in section",
    "[ sec : disvar ] , the construction of different variational integrators for electric circuits is described and conditions for their applicability are derived .",
    "the main structure - preserving properties of the lagrangian system and the variational integrator are summarized in section  [ sec : structure ] . in section  [ sec : noise ] , the approach is extended for the treatment of noisy circuits . in section  [ sex : example ] , the efficiency of the developed variational integrators is demonstrated by means of numerical examples . a comparison with standard circuit modeling and circuit integrators is given .",
    "in particular , the applicability of the multiscale method flavor @xcite is demonstrated for a circuit with different time scales .",
    "considering an electric circuit , we introduce the following notations ( following @xcite ) : a _ node _ is a point in the circuit where two or more elements meet .",
    "a _ path _ is a trace of adjacent elements , with no elements included more than once .",
    "a _ branch _ is a path that connects two nodes .",
    "a _ loop _ is a path that begins and ends at the same node .",
    "a _ mesh _ ( also called _ fundamental loop _ ) is a loop that does not enclose any other loops .",
    "a _ planar circuit _ is a circuit that can be drawn on a plane without crossing branches .",
    "let @xmath0 be the time - dependent charges , the currents and voltages of the circuit elements with @xmath1 $ ] , where @xmath2 are the corresponding quantities through the @xmath3 inductors , the @xmath4 capacitors , the @xmath5 resistors , and the @xmath6 voltage sources .",
    "in addition , we give each of those devices an assumed current flow direction . in table [ tab : chars ] , the characteristic equations for basic elements are listed .",
    ".characteristic equations for basic circuit elements . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this contribution , we presented a unified framework for the modeling and simulation of electric circuits .",
    "starting with a geometric setting , we formulate a unified variational formulation for the modeling of electric circuits .",
    "analogous to the formulation of mechanical systems , we define a degenerate lagrangian on the space of branches consisting of electric and magnetic energy , dissipative and external forces that describe the influence of resistors and voltage sources as well as ( non-)holonomic constraints given by the kcl of the circuit .",
    "the lagrange - dalembert - pontryagin principle is used to derive in a variational way the implicit euler - lagrange equations being differential - algebraic equations to describe the system s dynamics .",
    "a reduced version on the space of meshes is presented that is shown to be equivalent to the original system and for which under some topology assumptions the degeneracy of the lagrangian is canceled .",
    "based on the reduced version , a discrete variational approach is presented that provides different variational integrators for the simulation of circuits . in particular , the generated integrators are symplectic , preserve momentum maps in presence of symmetries and have good long - time energy bahvior .",
    "furthermore , we observe that the spectrum of high frequencies is especially better preserved compared to simulations using runge - kutta or bdf methods . having the variational framework for the model and the simulation , extensions of the approach using already - existing types of different variational integrators",
    "can be easily accomplished . as an example",
    ", we presented the extension for the simulation of noisy circuits using stochastic variational integrator approaches as well as multiscale methods ( in particular flavors ) for an efficient treatment of circuits with multiple time scales .    in the future",
    ", we will extend the approach to the simulation and analysis of more complicated nonlinear and magnetic circuits that might include nonlinear inductors , capacitors , resistors and transistors .",
    "since a variational formulation in terms of energies , forces and constraints is still valid for the nonlinear case , the presented integrators will be derived and applied in straight forward way .",
    "furthermore , the inclusion of controlled sources allows for the consideration of optimal control problems for circuits for which techniques also based on a variational formulation can be easily applied ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the variational simulation of combined mechanical and electric ( electro - mechanical ) systems is the natural next step towards the development of a unified variational modeling and simulation method for mechatronic systems .",
    "furthermore , at nanoscales , thermal noise and electromagnetic interactions become an essential component of the dynamic of electric circuits . we plan to investigate the coupling of variational integrators for circuits with multi - symplectic variational integrators for em fields and continuum mechanics ( see e.g.  @xcite ) to produce a robust structure - preserving numerical integrator for microelectromechanical and nanoelectromechanical systems .",
    "recently , mike giles has developed a multilevel monte carlo method for differential equations with stochastic forcings @xcite that shows huge computation accelerations ,  100 times in some cases .",
    "the extension of the current method to multilevel stochastic variational integrators is straight forward and may further accelerate computation dramatically , especially for multiscale problems , while preserving certain properties of the circuit network .",
