    "the `` reactor anti - neutrino anomaly '' is the observation that the average of the experimentally determined reactor anti - neutrino flux at reactor - detector distances less than 100 m accounts for only 0.946 @xmath1 0.023 of the theoretical expectation @xcite .",
    "one of the explanations for this anomaly is that standard neutrinos that carry the weak nuclear charge can oscillate into a",
    " sterile \" neutrino that does not contain a weak nuclear charge and escapes detection .",
    "this is one of the few types of experiments that could be sensitive to the sterile neutrinos .",
    "it is important to verify that the shape of the calculated anti - neutrino spectrum is correct .    in @xcite",
    "the effects of various corrections to the expected neutrino spectra were examined , but it was found that these corrections could not explain the anomaly . however , in @xcite only allowed decays were analyzed and the first forbidden(ff ) decay was left out . in @xcite the contribution of ff decays were examined by assuming some virtual ff branches in the decay , and it was found that the results could match the magnitude of the missing flux",
    ". however , the actual ff decays are much more complicated than the form assumed in @xcite . in this work",
    ", we will exam the effect of realistic ff decay from microscopic nuclear structure calculations , and make an estimation of their effect on the neutrino spectra .",
    "for the neutron - induced fission accumulated yield distributions one finds two peaks for the fission products .",
    "one of these is centered near @xmath2sr and another is centered near @xmath3xe . both or these regions could have comparable amount of ff branches .",
    "for the region of @xmath3xe calculations with the quasi - particle random phase ( qrpa ) method were carried out @xcite , and reasonable agreement between experiment and theory for half - lives and @xmath4 ft values were obtained . also shell - model ( sm ) calculations for some nuclei in the xe region",
    "can be carried out in a moderately large basis with previously derived hamiltonian .",
    "thus , in this work we will focus on applying the qrpa and sm methods in this xe region to investigate the effect of ff beta decay on the shape of the neutrino spectra .",
    "this article is arranged as follows .",
    "first we give some background on @xmath0-decay , especially the ff decays , and the nuclear structure theories we used in our calculations .",
    "then we present the calculated results with comparisons to experiments and the corresponding neutrino spectra .",
    "conclusions are given at the end .",
    "the decay rate for @xmath0-decay can be written generally as @xcite : @xmath5 with the conventions and numerical constants used in @xcite one obtains : @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the energy of the emitted electron in the units of electron mass , @xmath8 is the @xmath0-decay energy in the unit of electron mass , and @xmath9 is the momentum of the electron .",
    "@xmath10 is the fermi factor which takes into account of nuclear charge on the shape of the spectra for the emitted electron .",
    "the nuclear structure dependence on the shape of the emitted leptons is contained in @xmath11 .",
    "it has different @xmath12-dependencies for different kinds of decays that lead to the different spectra for emitted electron and neutrino . for allowed - decay ,",
    "@xmath11 is independent of @xmath12 . for the ff decay",
    ", the dependence can be written in the form @xcite : @xmath13 for ff decays one has three different types of transitions associated with the change of spins , @xmath14 , they have different matrix elements and @xmath12 dependencies : @xmath15 the detailed expressions for the @xmath16 s can be obtained from @xcite . for 0@xmath17 , there are three matrix elements @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , for 1@xmath17 one has five matrix elements involving @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and for 2@xmath17 just one matrix element @xmath26 is involved . the expressions for these matrix elements",
    "are given in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite only the @xmath18 , @xmath21 , @xmath23 and @xmath26 terms were used for ff branches .",
    "our additional terms result in some differences between our results and those of @xcite .    to get the electron or neutrino spectra , we take derivatives over the respective energies : @xmath27 the spectra for ff decays are different from that of allowed gt , and their shape depends on the decay modes ( @xmath28 ) . to obtain the spectra we need to know some detailed structure information for the @xmath0-active nuclei .    for the nuclear structure calculations ,",
    "the configuration interaction model or shell model ( sm ) provides an exact solution within a model space for a restricted set of valence orbitals .",
    "realistic shell - model hamiltonians can be derived from renormalized interactions based on the nucleon - nucleon interaction with some empirical single - particle energies and modifications to reproduce experimental binding energies and excitation energies . however , as the number of valence nucleons increase , the dimensions of the configurations increase drastically making the calculations impossible . starting with a closed shell of @xmath29sn one",
    "add nucleons in the  @xmath30 \" model space that consists of the five ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) orbitals for protons and the six ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) orbitals for neutrons .",
    "we can consider up to four neutrons and four protons in this @xmath30 model space .",
    "the sm can be applied to the decays of nuclei with both even and odd numbers of protons or neutrons .    to obtain results over a wider region of the nuclear chart",
    ", one needs to use various approximations .",
    "one of these is the quasi - particle random phase approximations ( qrpa ) which assumes the excited states of the nuclei are small harmonic oscillations beyond the hartree - fock - boglyubov ( hfb ) or bcs ground states .",
    "only two quasi - particle excitations are considered in this approximation . by changing one neutron to one proton or _ vice versa _ , we obtain the spectra for odd - odd nuclei , this is the so - called pn - qrpa method @xcite which is usually used for charge exchange reactions as well as @xmath0-decay . the qrpa method can only be applied to even - even nuclei .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ singsum ]    as we have stated above , different decay channels may have different shapes due to different dependencies over energy @xmath12 , so we need to investigate the effects of these decay channels on the neutrino spectra shape . for the odd - odd or odd -",
    "a nuclei there is usually mixing between different decay channels as @xmath42 , but for even - even nuclei , because the ground states of the parent nuclei has always @xmath43 , @xmath44 is unique for specific final state of daughter nuclei , there will be no mixing among different channels and it is easy to isolate different shape changes in different decay channels .    in fig.[sgl ] , we compare the neutrino spectra shape changes relative to the allowed shape for different channels with different methods for two even - even nuclei ( @xmath45te and @xmath3xe ) . for each nucleus",
    "we show the 0@xmath17 , 1@xmath17 and 2@xmath17 decay branches .",
    "the sm and qrpa methods agree well with each other . for @xmath46 decays ,",
    "the change of the spectra is small and it is a good approximation to treat the @xmath46 decay as allowed decay . for @xmath47 decay",
    "the change is large with the peak of the neutrino spectra shifted downwards .",
    "this means that more neutrinos have less energy than expected from the previous simulation@xcite using the allowed type of phase space . for @xmath48 decay",
    "the behavior of the change to the shape is a bit different from that of @xmath47 as seen from fig.[sgl ] where the shape of the neutrino spectra for this decay branch is broadened .",
    "we also make a comparison of the full microscopic calculations to the approximations made in @xcite where 4 out of 9 matrix elements are used ( affecting the 0@xmath17 and 1@xmath17 decays ) .",
    "for the 0@xmath17 decay , the approximation used in @xcite gives a result that is opposite to the full microscopic calculations , slightly shifting the neutrino spectra to lower energy . for 1@xmath17 decay",
    ", the approximation completely changes the behavior of the neutrino spectra . due to",
    "the over simplified forms in @xcite , the behavior of an overall shift of spectra to low energies disappears now .",
    "this comes from the fact that for simplified 1@xmath17 decay in table i of @xcite one of its matrix elements ( @xmath49^{1-}$ ] or @xmath21 in this work ) has the same form as that for 2@xmath17 decay ( @xmath49^{2-}$ ] or @xmath26 in this work ) .",
    "there is similar behavior between @xmath45te and @xmath3xe .",
    "we would also expect the same behaviors of these ff decay channels in odd - mass or odd - odd nuclei since they have the same transition operators as the even - even nuclei . from the above results ,",
    "we conclude that the inclusion of ff decays could eliminate the  reactor anti - neutrino anomaly \" if there are enough beta branches containing 1,2@xmath17 transitions with suitable end - point energies , especially 1@xmath17 .",
    "however , if we examine the nuclear chart for the decay branching ratios , we find that 1,2@xmath17 are usually accompanied with @xmath46 decays which usually have a much smaller @xmath4 ft values ( a stronger transition probability ) .",
    "this would reduce the overall changes to the spectra .    to quantify the change in the neutrino spectrum due to the change of phase space , we integrate over the spectra with the two phase spaces as follows , @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 is the energy needed to trigger the interaction @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is the maximum energy of emitted neutrinos .",
    "the reduction in the number of low - energy neutrinos is given by @xmath55 .",
    "the change depends on the end point energy @xmath54 , which can be expressed as @xmath56 .",
    "so we need precise excitation energies for the determination of neutrino spectra .",
    "this result can then be compared with the value of the reactor neutrino anomaly to see if the lack of ff phase space factor in the simulation can explain the missing neutrinos .",
    "the results for single decay branches are listed in table[singsum ] .",
    "a comparison between qrpa and shell model shows similarities for the ratio @xmath57 , this agrees with fig.[sgl ] . for the detailed values ; the change @xmath58 of the @xmath46 decay is negligible , for 1@xmath17",
    ", @xmath58 goes up to ten percent , and for 2@xmath17 , @xmath58 is only 2 - 3 percent .",
    "( defined in text ) on the end - point energies for several ff decay branches of @xmath45te(bold lines for qrpa calculations and dashed lines for sm calculations ) and @xmath3xe(dashed - dot lines for qrpa calculation ) . here",
    "we varying the q values of the two nuclei above to see how the changes are related to the end - point energies of the decay branches . ]    to obtain quantitative results on the dependence of the detailed changes on the end point energies of the decay branches , we vary the q values in the calculations for the two nuclei @xmath45te and @xmath3xe . the results are plotted in fig.[dn ] where one observes that to a large extent this relation is nucleus independent .",
    "@xmath58 for the @xmath46 branches are near zero except below end - point energies of 3 mev . for small end - point energies , @xmath58 is large due to the shape changes at the spectra tail ; but these are not important since contributions of these branches to the total spectra are small , see fig.3 of @xcite . for @xmath48 decay",
    "the dependence of @xmath57 on the end - point energies are independent of @xmath4 ft values since it has only one component . for end - point energies from 4 - 6 mev , @xmath58 is around @xmath59 .    however , for @xmath47 decays @xmath57 depends on both @xmath54 and @xmath4 ft . to see this we also plot the @xmath60 decay branches for the two nuclei fig.[dn ] .",
    "compared to @xmath61 the ff decays to the @xmath60 states have smaller @xmath4 ft values ( table.[ffrt ] ) ( i.e. they are stonger ) and have smaller @xmath58 values ( fig.[dn ] ) .",
    "the reason of this comes from the fact that the transition rates of @xmath47 are determined by five different components .",
    "they are combined to give the final decay rates , and their different combinations have different energy dependencies . at @xmath62 mev",
    ", @xmath58 is @xmath63 .",
    "it was estimated in @xcite that @xmath64 of the decay branches of the fission products are ff .",
    "thus , in the most extreme case where the ff is dominated by @xmath65 the change of the neutrino spectrum could be as large as @xmath66 .",
    "in this work , explicit analysis of @xmath0-decay neutrino spectra with inclusion of the first forbidden part has been performed .",
    "one finds that use of the allowed decay phase space factor results in a correction of up to about @xmath67 due to @xmath68 ff transitions .",
    "an average over all types of ff transitions , end - point energies and @xmath4 ft values would result in a smaller value of @xmath69 .",
    "the finite size effects and the weak magnetism corrections obtained in @xcite for the allowed ( gt ) decays are estimated to be @xmath70 .",
    "if the average branching ratios for all types of ff is estimated , they can be combined with our results to obtain an improved correction for the shape of the neutrino spectra .",
