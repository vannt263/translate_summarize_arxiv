    "one of the main objectives of the field of quantum chaos is to study the quantum mechanics of systems that are chaotic in the classical limit , and to find what properties of the classical systems appear crucial for the quantum description .",
    "there are some common approaches to the problem .",
    "one can explore the energy spectra of quantum analogs to classically chaotic , bounded systems @xcite , or investigate scattering resonances in the complex energy plane for unbounded quantum systems with chaotic classical repellers @xcite .",
    "interesting results relating the energy spectra of closed systems to the scattering resonances of the complementary open systems ( defined as the region `` outside '' the closed system ) are also known @xcite .",
    "another approach focuses on the time - dependent description , which involves such quantities as the quantum state autocorrelation functions @xcite and the loschmidt echo , or fidelity @xcite . in this paper",
    "we continue the second approach and address the time evolution of the autocorrelation function for quantum particles traveling in hard - disk and hard - sphere billiards in two and three spatial dimensions respectively .",
    "we have previously studied the short time dynamics of a small gaussian wave packet in arrays of hard - disk scatterers @xcite .",
    "the wave packet was considered to be much smaller than the disk radius , and its evolution was limited to times shorter than the ehrenfest time @xcite , at which time the wave packet size becomes comparable with the scatterer size .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to extend the previous results by investigating the wave packet dynamics in the limit of long times , much longer than the ehrenfest time . here",
    ", we show that substantial progress can be made for hard - ball , ( hard disk or sphere ) scattering systems containing only a small number of scatterers , and for wave packets in the diffraction regime , to be further specified below .    in a series of seminal papers @xcite gaspard and rice studied classical , semiclassical and quantum properties of a three - disk scattering system , in which a point particle moves in two dimensions in the presence of three fixed , impenetrable disk scatterers .",
    "the disks have the radius @xmath0 , and their centers are placed at the vertices of an equilateral triangle of side @xmath1 . below we will refer to this scattering system as to the three - disk equilateral billiard to distinguish it from other three - disk billiards , in which the scatterer centers form isosceles or generic triangles .",
    "the latter scattering systems will be referred as to the isosceles billiard and the generic triangle billiard , respectively . the classical version of the three - disk system is known to have a fractal repeller with the positive kolmogorov - sinai entropy @xcite .",
    "the quantum dynamics of a particle in the three - disk billiard is largely determined by scattering resonances , whose distribution in the complex energy plane reflects the chaotic properties of the corresponding classical system @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address the time evolution of initially localized wave packets in such hard - disk scattering systems as the two - disk billiard and the three - disk equilateral , isosceles and generic triangular billiards .",
    "we also extend our calculations to include other hard - sphere scattering systems in three spatial dimensions . as a tool for quantifying the wave packet dynamics we consider the autocorrelation function @xmath2 defined as the overlap @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the initial quantum state of a billiard , and @xmath5 is the quantum state obtained from the initial one by the time evolution through time @xmath6 under the hamiltonian @xmath7 : @xmath8",
    "we construct the quantum propagator , @xmath9 , for a dilute hard - disk billiard using the multiple collision expansion technique @xcite .",
    "then , we apply this propagator to an initially localized wave packet @xmath4 , corresponding to a highly - energetic particle traveling through the system , and calculate the autocorrelation function @xmath2 .",
    "the following two assumptions allow analytical treatment of the problem : ( i ) the scattering system is considered to be dilute , and ( ii ) the quantum particle is restricted to have a short de broglie wave length .",
    "( we will give further details below . )",
    "these assumptions limit the validity of our results for the autocorrelation function to a certain time range .",
    "the latter can be quite long : it is bounded from below by the ehrenfest time of the system , and typically extends over a large number of ehrenfest times .",
    "therefore , this work should be considered as an attempt to analytically describe the dynamics of initially localized wave packets over long times during which the quantum particle explores all the scattering system , and its wave function becomes spatially extended .",
    "it was pointed out by gaspard et al .",
    "@xcite that the time evolution of a wave packet in a hard - disk scattering system exhibits an overall exponential damping controlled by the location of the scattering resonances in the complex energy plane . as a result of this damping one expects the wave packet autocorrelation function , @xmath2 , to decay in an exponential - like manner as well .",
    "we explicitly calculate the autocorrelation function for wave packets in various hard - disk billiards and investigate the structure of its time decay .",
    "we find that the decay consists of a sequence of sharp peaks with the exponentially decreasing envelope .",
    "the peaks reflect the phenomenon of the wave packet partial reconstruction due to interference of different classical periodic orbits in the billiard .",
    "the maxima of the peaks occur at times at which the classical particle , having the momentum equal to the average momentum of the wave packet , would return to its initial phase - space point .",
    "although the long - time autocorrelation function peaks have the same origin as the ones in the short - time autocorrelation function @xcite , the peaks at longer times result from the constructive interference of a large number of classical trajectories whereas only a single classical path is responsible for the wave packet reconstruction during times shorter than the ehrenfest time .",
    "the envelope of the autocorrelation function for a two - dimensional hard - disk billiard decays exponentially with time , @xmath10 , with the rate @xmath11 approximately equal to the difference of the mean positive lyapunov exponent , @xmath12 , and twice the kolmogorov - sinai ( ks ) entropy per unit time , @xmath13 , of the repeller of the corresponding classical system , i.e. @xmath14 . this decay rate is nothing but the quantum escape rate originally obtained by gaspard and rice @xcite .",
    "our generalization to three spatial dimensions shows that the envelope of the wave packet autocorrelation function also decays exponentially , @xmath15 , with the decay rate @xmath16 , where the place of @xmath12 in the expression for @xmath11 is taken by the sum of the two mean positive lyapunov exponents @xmath17 and @xmath18 of the classical hard - sphere system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we calculate the autocorrelation function , @xmath2 , for wave packets in two - disk and various three - disk scattering systems using the method of the multiple collision expansion .",
    "we show that the structure of @xmath2 is generally quite intricate , and we provide explanations of its main features . section  iii presents an alternative description of the autocorrelation function decay based on the semiclassical arguments .",
    "while the semi - classical method described here does not provide as much detail about the autocorrelation functions as do the multiple scattering methods , it does provide information about the relative strengths of the peaks and their location .",
    "moreover this method allows us to obtain information about more complicated systems that are difficult to treat using more exact methods .",
    "for example , in this section we use the semi - classical method to treat generic three disk scatterers , and to generalize our methods to three spatial dimensions to describe the wave packet dynamics in two- , three- and four - sphere scattering systems .",
    "our conclusions and discussions are contained in the chapter  iv of the paper .",

    "the hamiltonian of the system can be written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the free particle hamiltonian , and the hard - disk scatterer potentials are given by @xmath25 the time - domain propagator , @xmath26 , satisfying the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian @xmath7 , evolves an initial quantum state @xmath4 in time in accordance with eq .",

    "this means that the autocorrelation overlap @xmath117 gets a significant scattering contribution in addition to its free - streaming part , @xmath118 , ( which is negligible for dilute systems ) only if the wave packet is initially located on and moves along a line connecting centers of any two disks in the scattering system .",
    "this happens because the reflection wave produced by a disk at the last scattering interferes destructively with the initial wave unless the two waves have their wave vectors pointing almost in the same direction .",

    "thus , @xmath482 and @xmath483 in the three - sphere equilateral billiard the number of possible trajectories multiplies by two at every collision , so that @xmath484 , leading to @xmath485 in the same way we conclude that in the four - sphere tetrahedral billiard the number of possible collision sequences is @xmath486 , so that the topological entropy per unit time reads @xmath487    every trajectory @xmath334 of the three - dimensional hard - sphere billiard repeller has two positive lyapunov exponents , @xmath488 and @xmath489 , corresponding to perturbations of the particle s initial conditions in two direction perpendicular to the trajectory .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the sum of the two lyapunov exponent , for a dilute hard - sphere scattering system , @xmath109 , does not depend on the details of the trajectory @xmath334 , and is given by @xcite @xmath490 the last equality is obvious for the two - sphere periodic orbit , since in that case @xmath491 . in the case of a general hard - sphere dilute scattering system the method of curvature radii @xcite can be used to prove eq .",

    "one can also verify that the semiclassical decay rates , given by eqs .",

    "( [ 3.50 ] ) and ( [ 3.51 ] ) respectively .",
    "the appearance of the factor of @xmath443 in the expression for the semiclassical decay rate is now apparent : the strength of the wave packet partial reconstruction peaks , @xmath2 , is proportional to @xmath495 due to interference of different periodic orbits , while in the classical case @xmath328 is given merely by the sum of orbit probabilities , and is proportional to @xmath480 .",
    "one can also see now that the difference of the two escape rates is given by the topological entropy ( which , for the three - dimensional billiards in question , is equal to the ks - entropy ) of the chaotic repeller of the classical system , and is therefore determined by underlying classical dynamics .    finally , we would like to further clarify the appearance of the factor of @xmath443 in the expression for the semiclassical escape rate , eq .",
    "( [ 3.58 ] ) , by means of the following simple argument .",
    "consider a classical periodic orbit @xmath334 of the period @xmath6 , schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig-12 ] , passing through the phase space point around which the initial wave packet is localized . in a general chaotic system",
    "the number of such periodic orbits @xmath480 grows exponentially with the period @xmath6 , and the rate of this growth is given by the topological entropy per unit time , @xmath479 , see eq .",
    "( [ 3.52 ] ) . in order to determine the probability weight @xmath496 of the orbit @xmath334",
    ", one needs to consider a bundle of trajectories which stay infinitesimally close to @xmath334 .",
    "these trajectories form an exponentially thickening tube , see fig .",
    "[ fig-12 ] , with the initial and final cross sections , @xmath497 and @xmath498 respectively , related by @xmath499 here the sum goes over all positive lyapunov exponents @xmath500 of the periodic orbit @xmath334 .",
    "then , the probability for a classical particle taken at random from the trajectory bundle to stay on the periodic orbit @xmath334 is proportional to the ratio @xmath501 , so that @xmath502 equation  ( [ 3.60 ] ) together with ( [ 3.52 ] ) leads to the expression for the semiclassical escape rate in the case when the sum over positive lyapunov exponents , @xmath503 , does not significantly depend on the details of the orbit @xmath334 , and can be replaced by its average value @xmath504 .",
    "then , the sum over orbits @xmath505 in eq .",
    "( [ 3.8 ] ) is simply equal to the product of the number of these orbits , @xmath480 , given by eq .",
    "( [ 3.52 ] ) , and the probability amplitude , @xmath506 , identical for all the orbits and calculated in accordance with eq .  ( [ 3.60 ] ) .",
    "the substitution yields @xmath507 .",
    "\\label{3.61}\\ ] ] thus , we recover the expression for the semiclassical autocorrelation function decay rate , eq .",
    "( [ 3.58 ] ) , obtained for a number of hard - sphere billiards in three spatial dimensions .",
    "the purpose of the above oversimplified derivation is only to illustrate the origin of the intimate relation between the quantum escape rate and such properties of the underlying classical chaotic system as the lyapunov exponents and topological ( and/or ks ) entropy .",
    "the details of this relation as well as the limits of its applicability are yet to be investigated .",
    "in the first part of this paper we used the technique of multiple collision expansions to construct the quantum propagator for a particle with the de broglie wavelength , @xmath355 , traveling in an array of hard - disk scatterers of radius @xmath508 .",
    "the scattering system was assumed to be so dilute that the typical scatterer separation @xmath1 satisfied the condition @xmath509 .",
    "the quantum propagator was used to analytically calculate the time - dependent autocorrelation function for a wave packet , initially localized in both position and momentum spaces , evolving in open two- and three - disk billiard systems .",
    "it was found that the autocorrelation function exhibits a sequence of sharp peaks at times multiple to periods of classical phase space periodic orbits of the billiards .",
    "these peaks correspond to partial reconstructions of the initial wave packet in the course of its time evolution .",
    "the envelope of the correlation function decays exponentially with time after one or two particle - disk collisions ; the exponential decay lasts for some @xmath510 scattering events .",
    "our calculations recovered the autocorrelation function decay rate , first obtained in reference @xcite , for a particle moving in the three - disk equilateral billiard , and predicted the detailed structure and the decay rate of the autocorrelation function for the more complicated three - disk isosceles billiard .",
    "in the second part of this paper the method of the semiclassical van vleck propagator was utilized to derive a simple expression for the relative magnitude of the wave packet partial reconstruction peaks .",
    "although fails to describe the full time dependence of the autocorrelation function , this method allows one to calculate , analytically or numerically , the decay rates of the autocorrelation function envelope ( also known as particle escape rates ) for much more complicated hard - disk and hard - sphere scattering systems .",
    "here we used it to analyze the three - disk generic billiard , the two - sphere , three - sphere equilateral and three - sphere tetrahedral scattering systems .",
    "a straightforward modification of the semiclassical method allowed us to construct the expression for the peaks of the classical autocorrelation function , and to compare classical and semiclassical particle escape rates in various open hard - disk and hard - sphere billiards .",
    "the semiclassical escape rate in three - dimensional scattering systems was shown to be given by the difference of the sum of the two positive lyapunov exponents and twice the topological entropy ( in this case equal to the ks - entropy ) per unit time of the underlying classical repeller .",
    "thus , the semiclassical escape rate is never grater then the classical one , and the difference between the two equals to the topological ( or ks ) entropy per unit time of the classical system .",
    "this result is consistent with the earlier findings of reference @xcite for the case of the two - dimensional hard - disk billiards , and therefore strengthens the connection between classical and quantum chaos .",
    "an interesting seeming `` paradox '' arises if one compares the expressions for the classical and semiclassical escape rates , e.g. see eqs .",
    "( [ 3.57 ] ) and ( [ 3.58 ] ) . indeed , according to the correspondence principle it is expected that in the limit of the de broglie wavelength going to zero the semiclassical escape rate should match its classical counterpart .",
    "this seems to be incompatible with the results of this paper : the semiclassical escape rate is expressed in terms of classical quantities only ( and does not depend on the de broglie wavelength ) , and ( in the case of hard - sphere billiards ) is smaller than the classical one by the value of the topological entropy of the system .",
    "in fact , the difference of the two escape rates originates from noncommutivity of the order in which the infinite time limit and the classical ( de broglie wavelength going to zero ) limit are taken .",
    "this question has been carefully studied by barra and gaspard for the case of quantum graphs @xcite , as well as discussed in ref .",
