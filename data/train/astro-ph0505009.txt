    "one of the most important deficiencies in stellar evolution theory is the lack of a physically correct treatment of convective motions and convective transport of energy .",
    "the extreme difficulty of solving the well - known hydrodynamic equations on all different scales is a long standing mathematical and computational challenge . due to these unsolved complications of an accurate treatment , convection in stars",
    "has been described by mixing length theory ( mlt ) ( b \" ohm - vitense 1958 ) , a simple phenomenological method for treating convection locally . within the framework of mlt ( 1965 ) and & schwarzschild ( 1965 )",
    "were the first who estimated the penetration of convective motions into the radiative regions due to a finite convective velocity at the schwarzschild boundary defined by vanishing acceleration through buoyancy .",
    "the result , a negligible amount of overshoot of @xmath7 was criticized by & salpeter ( 1973 ) who found appreciable overshoot within the framework of a simplified non - local mixing length model .",
    "most stellar modelers since have considered overshoot only in a parameterized way by extending the core size by some fraction @xmath8 of the pressure scale height @xmath9 taken at the locus of the schwarzschild boundary .    in the present work",
    "we implement a physically better motivated phenomenological model for convection including overshoot into stellar evolution calculations , a _ non - local _ convection theory developed by ( 1986 ) and we contrast this approach with the traditional ones . in both cases",
    "we are left with free parameters . in mlt",
    "only the overshoot parameter @xmath8 has to be considered for the extension of the convective cores .",
    "the situation is more complicated for the ( 1986 ) convection theory ( kct ) .",
    "nonetheless , we vary only one parameter @xmath10 that is the most relevant for the amount of overshoot .",
    "empirically , isochrone fitting to color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of open clusters have so far given the most quantitative results for the amount of core overshoot .",
    "the underlying hypothesis in these studies is that all stars have been formed from the same material at the same epoch .",
    "both age and metallicity of the cluster are not known and a range of parameters has to be matched to observations .",
    "however , most uncertainty is introduced through contamination of unresolved binary systems and variable stars , the need to clean the sample from non - member field stars ( cf .",
    ", kozhurina - platais et  al .",
    "1997 ) , the relatively small number of stars in the sample and the systematics introduced by transforming the cmd to the theoretical hrd diagram .",
    "studies of this kind have been performed to test the overshoot parameter , e.g. , by & demarque ( 1974 ) , & mermilliod ( 1981 ) , ( 1998 ) and , sarajedini , & guo ( 1994 ) who obtain for their best fit a value of @xmath11 , which can be regarded as a canonical value .    in a different approach , detached and evolved eclipsing binaries have been used to constrain the amount of overshoot . ,",
    "jordi , & gim ' enez ( 2000 ) studied eight such objects and found an overall best fit of @xmath12 and more strikingly a clear trend of increased overshoot with increasing mass .",
    "recently , ( 2003 ) ; dupret et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) have used observed seismic constraints to deduct the extent of core overshoot in the @xmath13cep star hd 129929 .",
    "based on fitting three identified pulsation frequencies these authors claim an overshoot parameter of @xmath14 for this @xmath15 star .",
    "while unambiguously identified single frequencies hold the promise of strongly constraining stellar models , we think that many more frequencies than free stellar parameters must be used for such an analysis .",
    "we show in this paper , that the frequencies are also influenced by the adopted overshoot prescription , which constitutes an additional uncertainty not previously taken into account in stellar modeling .",
    "our main objective in this study is to show how averaged frequency spacings can be used to constrain core overshoot in carefully selected single stars like .",
    "the advantage of this technique is that averaged spacings may not depend on individual mode identifications as critically as single modes do .",
    "results from this approach produce weaker constraints on stellar models but on the other hand should yield more solid results . by extensively analyzing the pulsation properties of many different models for",
    "we show that the oscillation characteristics contain very detailed information about overshoot and the stellar interior .",
    "we outline ways to constrain the overshoot parameter that may become practical in the future .",
    "we use the yale rotating stellar evolution code ( yrec ) ( pinsonneault 1988 ; guenther et  al . 1992 ) in its non - rotating configuration .",
    "the four classic stellar structure equations , namely poisson s , hydrostatic , energy transport and energy equations are solved with a henyey relaxation scheme in the interior and a shooting technique in the outer envelope and atmosphere .",
    "the fitting point of the interior model to the envelope is set at the fixed mass @xmath16 .",
    "a nuclear reaction network is solved separately .",
    "the separation of the chemical part from the structural part can be done safely in the main burning stage of hydrogen burning considered here since the nuclear timescale and therefore the change in composition is long compared to the thermal and dynamical timescales involved .",
    "has a very thin outer convective zone of @xmath17 and in these outer layers standard mlt is used . in the absence of overshoot",
    ", core convection is also treated in a standard way by determining the regions of convective instability with the schwarzschild criterion . in regions where it indicates convection , the temperature gradient in the energy transport equation",
    "is set to the adiabatic gradient , thereby assuming fully developed turbulent convection .",
    "the superadiabaticity which can be estimated to be typically on the order of @xmath18 in the deep stellar layers is thereby neglected and the mixing length parameter present in mlt becomes irrelevant .",
    "the deviation of @xmath18 from strict adiabaticity is too tiny to have any effect on the stellar structure or the pulsation frequencies which are mainly sensitive to the sound speed and the mean molecular weight gradient .",
    "in addition , chemical species are mixed instantaneously within convective regions justified by the short mixing timescale compared to the nuclear timescale under the conditions prevalent in this study .    for the material functions , the opal equation of state",
    "( rogers , swenson , & iglesias 1996 ) and opal opacities ( iglesias & rogers 1996 ) for temperatures above @xmath19 are used , and in the low temperature regime @xmath20 , we use opacities by & ferguson ( 1994 ) . in the transition region the low temperature opacity tables and the interior opacities are ramp averaged .",
    "the number of grid points can be crucial for calculating correct convective core sizes and pulsation frequencies .",
    "yrec inserts and deletes grid points according to specified criteria on structural variables ( e.g. , pressure ) . with the help of some test calculations",
    "we find that @xmath21 grid points are sufficient for both core size and pulsation frequencies .",
    "our models generally consist of about 1800 grid points , twice as many as minimally required .",
    "the innermost mass shell is taken at @xmath22 and we verified that this is about an order of magnitude lower than needed to produce correct pulsation frequencies .    a note on terminology .",
    "( 1991 ) proposes to distinguish between the term _ overshooting _ and _ penetration _ since they have a more precise meaning in fluid dynamics . in this nomenclature ,",
    "_ overshooting _ is reserved for inefficient penetration , that does not alter the stable temperature gradient whereas _ subadiabatic penetration",
    "_ refers to convective heat transport efficient enough to establish a nearly adiabatic temperature gradient . in this paper , we prefer to use _ overshoot _ as the superordinate term for all penetration beyond the stability boundary regardless of its efficiency .",
    "however , we refer to penetration that does not alter the temperature gradient as _",
    "overmixing_.      there exists vast theoretical and experimental evidence for overshoot in geophysical fluids , laboratory experiments and computer simulations ( zahn 1991 ) . with a simple theoretical model utilizing the usual scaling laws of thermal convection ( 1991 )",
    "demonstrates that the subadiabatic penetration above a convective core should amount to a substantial fraction of the core radius in the interior of stars .",
    "if correct , overshoot would strongly influence the evolution of stars for its structure , chemical enrichment , lifetime and possibly its fate .",
    "it has long been recognized that mlt , still commonly used in almost all stellar evolution calculations , being a strictly local theory , can not account for the phenomenon of penetrative motions beyond the classical boundary of convective cores .",
    "many non - local convection theories available from geophysics or other fields have been largely ignored for two reasons .",
    "first , many of them are difficult to implement within the numerical scheme adopted in stellar evolution and probably more importantly contain short lived timescales of the order of the frequency , thus rendering it impossible to follow stellar evolution on timescales comparable to the thermal and nuclear timescales . secondly , many of those theories contain more than one free parameter giving argument to the view that more elaborate descriptions may be more correct but nonetheless exhibit arbitrary degrees of freedom . in this spirit , and",
    "partly supported by the success of the one parameter mlt , all actual stellar evolution calculations employing overshoot , extend the boundary of the convective core by some fraction @xmath8 of the local pressure scale height taken at this very boundary .",
    "the extended region is treated differently by different authors , some only taking additional mixing of chemical species into account while others also alter the temperature gradient in this region . while this approach being simple , it can not be regarded as an adequate method to capture the physical phenomenon underlying core overshoot and it is not surprising that the value of @xmath8 is disputed not only over its correct value , but",
    "also whether the same value should be taken at the bottom and the top of convective regions , and whether higher values should be used for stars with higher mass ( ribas et  al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "we feel it is time to advance the prescription of overshoot employed in stellar evolution calculations .",
    "we choose to implement a one dimensional non - local convection theory developed by ( 1986 ) in the simplest possible way .",
    "note that ( 1986 ) derives an equation for the specific turbulent kinetic energy by proper spherically averaging of the first order perturbed navier - stokes equations .",
    "the principal difficulty that arises in all phenomenological theories of convection is to model the ( unknown ) correlation functions of the fluctuating quantities .",
    "this is done within the framework of anelastic and diffusion type approximations by introducing free parameters for every term arising in the equation .",
    "thus , we are left with five free parameters .",
    "( 1986 ) fixes two of them by matching the convective velocity and the convective flux with the corresponding mlt values .",
    "we do not alter those in this study .",
    "the remaining parameters consist of a mixing length parameter @xmath23 ( analogous to mlt ) and an overshoot parameter @xmath10 ( analogous to @xmath8 ) .",
    "the third free parameter does not appear in the original ( 1986)-theory and was first introduced in it by & feuchtinger ( 1998 ) , a parameter @xmath24 that essentially limits the local pressure scale height @xmath9 to a more meaningful geometrical length scale in the center of the star where @xmath9 formally goes to infinity .",
    "we use the convection model by ( 1986 ) for several reasons .",
    "his model consists of only one equation making it relatively easy to implement in stellar evolution ( [ sec : impov ] ) , the equation is derived from the proper hydrodynamical equations and we trust it to be physically meaningful for conditions prevalent in stellar cores . in the stationary , strictly local limit the cubic equation of mlt is retained when the ledoux criterion is employed . and finally , the ( 1986)-theory gives the same qualitative behavior for the temperature stratification in the overshoot region as derived by ( 1991 ) .",
    "core overshoot in yrec has been previously treated in a way most widely used in stellar evolution codes . in a first step ,",
    "the boundary of the convective core is determined by the schwarzschild criterion , i.e. , regions where @xmath25 are labeled as convection zones . since superadiabaticity is small in the interior of stars , as discussed before , the actual stellar temperature gradient is then set to the adiabatic gradient @xmath26 within the convection zone . in a second step ,",
    "a new boundary is determined by adding a fraction @xmath27 of the pressure scale height to the boundary at radius @xmath28 determined by the schwarzschild criterion @xmath29 where @xmath9 is taken at the schwarzschild boundary .",
    "finally , all chemical elements are mixed homogeneously within the new boundary radius given by @xmath30 . by construction , only the mixed region is extended whereas the temperature stratification is not affected directly within the overshoot region .",
    "this approach is most correctly termed _",
    "overmixing_. we label models using overmixing with _",
    "ct1 _ and call the overshoot parameter in this case @xmath27 .",
    "it has been pointed out by ( 1991 ) that the temperature stratification in the overshoot region is rendered almost adiabatic due to efficient heat transport in this region and that this allows for more overshoot than would be possible with the original stratification .",
    "the solutions calculated from ( 1986 ) s model also agree with this assessment . in order to mimic this effect , we optionally alter the treatment of overshoot in yrec such that the temperature gradient is set to the adiabatic gradient also in the overshoot region up to @xmath30 .",
    "in the course of evolution , the convective core size will differ from the previous approach when adopting the same overshoot parameter .",
    "it is therefore important to make clear which overshoot prescription was being used when discussing values of the overshoot parameter .",
    "we do so by labeling models using this approach with _",
    "ct2 _ and denote the overshoot parameter with @xmath8 .      the basic equation of ( 1986 )",
    "s model is an equation for the time - development of specific turbulent kinetic energy , @xmath31}$ ] , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the lagrangian time derivative , @xmath34 is density , @xmath35 turbulent pressure , @xmath36 stellar radius , @xmath9 pressure scale height , @xmath26 adiabatic gradient , @xmath37 geometrically limited mixing length scale and @xmath38 viscous energy dissipation .",
    "the first term on the right hand side of this equation is the driving term for convection and it is proportional to the convective flux , @xmath39 , @xmath40    \\label{eq : jw}\\ ] ] with @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the turbulent driving parameter , @xmath43 the specific heat at constant pressure , and in the case of an ideal gas with radiation pressure the dimensional parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 take on the values @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively . the turbulent flux @xmath39 is essentially controlled by the buoyancy term and the molecular weight gradient in brackets .",
    "this term is positive ( negative ) in regions where the ledoux criterion would indicate convective instability ( stability ) giving rise to a source ( sink ) term in ( [ eq : wturbeqn ] ) thereby creating ( destroying ) turbulent kinetic energy .",
    "note that the temperature gradient @xmath49 is not known _ a priori_. it is rather a quantity that must be determined from the convection theory ( see appendix  [ apx : algebra ] ) .",
    "the second term on the right hand side of the basic ( [ eq : wturbeqn ] ) is a dissipation term with @xmath50 being the dissipation efficiency parameter and it acts always as a sink .",
    "this term controls the superadiabaticity in the stationary limit of fully developed convection .",
    "all terms discussed so far are functions of variables defined locally at each mass shell of the star . if we were to restrict ourselves to only these variables and assume time independence , the convective core size would match exactly the size determined by the ledoux criterion or , when neglecting @xmath51 , by the schwarzschild criterion .",
    "indeed , the only deviation from mlt would be a different superadiabaticity , but since it is very small in the core it does not make a difference for the stellar model whether the temperature gradient @xmath49 equals @xmath52 or @xmath53 .    in view of its relevance to the convective core size",
    "the novel part of ( 1986 ) theory stems from the non - local term , the third term in ( [ eq : wturbeqn ] ) where @xmath54 is given by @xmath55 since this term is proportional to the second spatial derivative of the specific turbulent kinetic energy it leads to overshoot ( increase of convective region beyond schwarzschild boundary ) in regions of positive curvature and to _ undershoot _",
    "( decrease of convective region below schwarzschild boundary ) in regions of negative curvature . in the case of core convection",
    "only the increase of convective core size has been encountered in our studies . the free parameters @xmath42 and @xmath50 are factors that determine the values of convective velocity and convective flux . as ( 1987 ) demonstrates , they can be exactly matched to the ones of mlt by setting : @xmath56 we use these standard values throughout this study but it must be stressed that this choice is not obligatory and with the kind of methods described in this paper it will hopefully prove possible to derive those parameters from observations as demonstrated here for the overshoot parameter @xmath10 .",
    "we neglect the second term on the left hand side of the turbulent kinetic energy equation , since we are only concerned with the hydrostatic main - sequence phase in which the star is thermally relaxed and @xmath57 is close to zero . for stars that are not in thermal equilibrium , e.g. , in the pre - main sequence phase or in the contraction phase before the onset of helium burning",
    ", this term must be taken into account .",
    "we also neglect the last term in ( [ eq : wturbeqn ] ) , the viscous energy dissipation .",
    "this term is only important for high velocity flows which are not encountered during the star s main - sequence lifetime .",
    "these simplifications yield @xmath58 we aim at finding a solution for @xmath59 in the stationary limit @xmath60 and we show in appendix  [ apx : algebra ] that ( [ eq : wturbeqnsimp ] ) can be cast into the following form : @xmath61 with @xmath62 where @xmath63@xmath64 are functions of the known stellar background model . without the non - local terms , finding a stationary solution is simple , similar to mlt , one has to solve a cubic algebraic equation at every mass shell . however , with the spatial coupling an analytic expression is not obvious .",
    "therefore , we solve the non - linear , time - dependent ( [ eq : wturbeqmath ] ) .",
    "there is just one further complication . in radiative regions ( [ eq : wturbeqmath ] )",
    "does not have a stationary solution .",
    "one might be tempted to set @xmath65 in those regions which is a trivial solution to ( [ eq : wturbeqmath ] ) . however , the zero solution branch is completely separated from the finite solution path and therefore @xmath59 will always remain zero .",
    "in reality , some finite turbulent kinetic energy is always maintained due to thermal noise .",
    "technically , this problem can be overcome by adding an artificial term to the right hand side of ( [ eq : wturbeqmath ] ) : @xmath66 this artificial term can be motivated based on the physical picture that it maintains a noise , or seed convection underground of @xmath67 in radiative regions .",
    "it must be strongly emphasized , that seed values about two orders of magnitude higher start to falsify the solution .",
    "order of magnitude lower values are possible in principle but one quickly runs into problems related to lack of numerical precision . with this carefully chosen artificial term ,",
    "we first initialize @xmath59 to some arbitrary value ( typically @xmath68 ) and subsequently use an implicit time integration method to reach the equilibrium state .",
    "we utilize limex ( linear implicit extrapolation method ) ( ehrig & nowak 2002 ) for performing the time - integration .",
    "the solution yields the specific turbulent kinetic energy @xmath59 at every mass shell .",
    "we define shells to be convective , if : @xmath69 thereby determining the size of the convective core .",
    "the boundary of the convective region is sharply defined by an extremely steep falloff of @xmath59 .",
    "in fact , the transition region can be estimated and is on the order of @xmath70 , orders of magnitudes below the model resolution .",
    "finally , the temperature gradient can be calculated from ( see appendix  [ apx : algebra ] ) : @xmath71 and it remains close to the adiabatic one over the complete convection region .",
    "we refer to models that were calculated with the kuhfu convection theory with _",
    "ct3 _ and the associated overshoot parameter with @xmath10 .",
    "a first comparison of core sizes between mlt and kct has been given by kuhfu himself in his phd thesis ( kuhfu 1987 ) .",
    "for a @xmath5 with @xmath72 and @xmath73 he deduces a core overshoot parameter equivalent to @xmath74 above the mlt schwarzschild boundary .",
    "furthermore , his analysis gives large overshoot of @xmath75 even for the lowest mass stars around @xmath76 .",
    "however , as has been pointed out by & feuchtinger ( 1998 ) in the context of the kct when applied to rr - lyrae stars , the pressure scale height @xmath9 must be limited where it exceeds the geometrically possible length scale . in the case of rr - lyrae stars ,",
    "the pressure scale height is limited by the distance to the stellar surface .",
    "a similar situation occurs in the deep interior of stars .",
    "the pressure scale height goes to infinity when approaching the stellar center rendering it an inadequate measure of scale length in regions close to the center .",
    "again , it is physically plausible to limit the length scale to the geometrical distance of the center yielding a length scale @xmath77 of : @xmath78 introducing the parameter @xmath24 which we set to @xmath79 throughout this whole paper . in a non - local theory of convection this limited pressure scale height in the central regions",
    "influences not only the core size of stars with small convective cores but it is also important for all stellar core sizes and masses .    with this modified length scale ,",
    "we repeat the comparison between mlt and kct for two cases , one with @xmath80 and the other with @xmath81 both values in accord with stellar evolution of ( see [ sec : constrov ] ) .",
    "we determine the amount of overshoot  measured in pressure scale heights  needed to reproduce the models employing kct . as can be seen in [ fig : ribasvgl ] our models show less overshoot compared to kuhfu s original analysis : with @xmath82 we find @xmath83 for a @xmath4 star and @xmath84 for a @xmath5 star .",
    "since ( 2000 ) claim an increase of core overshoot for increasing mass by measurements of eclipsing binaries we also ask whether kct can naturally explain this behavior .",
    "indeed , we can see a moderate increase of overshoot with mass .",
    "nonetheless , the increase is not pronounced enough to explain the large overshoot of @xmath85 claimed for the @xmath86 star _ v380  cyg_. by increasing the mixing length parameter @xmath23 the increase of overshoot with mass can be enhanced slightly but an overshoot of @xmath85 remains out of reach .",
    "it is obvious to think rotation could play an important role in increasing the core through rotational mixing in a star of such high mass .",
    "( 2000 ) have carried out a detailed analysis of this system reaching the conclusion that the slow rotation of this star can not account for substantial additional core size increase .",
    "the recently derived overshoot of @xmath14 for another high mass star with @xmath87 ( aerts et  al .",
    "2003 ; dupret et  al .",
    "2004 ) seems to indicate that the large overshoot for _",
    "cyg _ may not be a universal property of high mass stars .",
    "and its companion white dwarf constitute a visual binary system with a 40 yr period .",

    "the same study also determines the parallax of to be @xmath89 a value different from the _ hipparcos _ result @xmath90 .",
    "we take the mean value of both independent measurements and adopt the difference to the upper and lower bound of these measurements as our @xmath91 error estimate thereby yielding @xmath92 .",
    "the larger adopted uncertainties for the parallax lead to larger error bars for radius and luminosity than otherwise expected if we had used the quoted errors from the actual measurements .",

    "involved one finds the radius @xmath95 adopting @xmath96 ( chollet & sinceac 1999 ) .",
    "this result is statistically identical to the independent angular diameter measurement of ( 2004 ) .",

    "the best fit values are @xmath168 , @xmath169 and @xmath170 ( [ fig : bestfit ] ) .",
    "smaller mass and @xmath23 and larger @xmath171 , @xmath172 shift tracks to lower luminosities thereby requiring more overshoot in order to bring the tracks back into the observational error box .",
    "we now simultaneously alter all four input parameters such that maximal overshoot is needed .",
    "the first set of upper overshoot limits is derived by using a mass of @xmath173 , @xmath174 and hydrogen @xmath175 and metallicity of @xmath176 .",

    "thus we take the most extreme values in favor of overshoot .",
    "the strong limits are @xmath182 and @xmath183 ( see [ fig : stronglimits ] ) .    an interesting property of the ( 1986)-theory is , that the core size can not be increased above a certain limit regardless of the overshoot parameter @xmath10 . for procyon ,",
    "the extent of the overshoot region is not substantially increased above @xmath184 .",
    "this behavior is rooted in the kct and we will discuss this in more detail in the next section ( [ sec : extkct ] ) .      it is important to point out that the role of the free parameter @xmath10 is different compared to the free parameters @xmath27 or @xmath8 .",
    "increasing the latter two will always lead to more extended convective cores  up until the star is fully convective . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath10 is a factor regulating the relative importance of the non - local terms , i.e. , the third term in  [ eq : wturbeqnsimp ] .",
    "increasing the non - local coupling does not always lead to more extended overshoot .",
    "in fact , extremely large values for @xmath8 lead to smaller overshoot extents .",
    "the run of the non - local term is shown in  [ fig : oversh ] ( left panel ) for three different and extremely high values for @xmath10 .",
    "the largest convective cores can be attained with @xmath185 which corresponds to an overshoot distance of @xmath6 .",
    "the model with @xmath186 produces smaller overshoot regions .",
    "the reason for this lies in the run of the non - local term itself : above the schwarzschild boundary this term is positive and acts towards more extended cores but in the inner regions it is negative and acts to decrease the overshoot distance .",
    "the net effect can be studied in  [ fig : oversh ] ( right panel ) where we show the corresponding stationary solution of the turbulent kinetic energy .",
    "high values of @xmath10 finally decrease the turbulent kinetic energy in the inner part and thereby the velocity of the eddies at the schwarzschild boundary such that they lack the energy to travel far .    in both panels of  [ fig : oversh ] we show how the maximum core size derived from the kuhfu theory compares with the well known integral criterion derived by ( 1978 ) . as can be seen from the figures , the maximally allowed sizes by kct almost exactly match the core size predicted by the integral criterion .    with this property of the more physically motivated overshoot prescription it would be possible to constrain the uncertainties of mass , hydrogen content , metallicity and mixing - length parameter .",
    "since the scope of this paper is to find _ observational _ constraints from traditional stellar modeling when combined with seismological data we do not explore this possibility in more detail . however , when comparing the different overshoot prescriptions in the next sections we must keep in mind that models of employing the kuhfu - theory inherit convective cores with an overshoot distance not larger than @xmath6 .",
    "ground based attempts to measure the p - mode large spacings have so far been inconclusive ( brown et  al .",

    "however , all these measurements have been restricted to single site measurements producing data contaminated by significant amplitudes of daily aliases .",
    "while p - mode frequencies as a function of radial and azimuthal order @xmath189 hold the most accurate and detailed information about the run of sound speed within a star , one can not hope to match the model to all frequencies by blindly searching the allowed parameter space .",
    "this procedure would only work if a stellar model matched the star as well as our solar models match the sun .",
    "also , inversion techniques can not be easily applied to stars because we are only able to observe low azimuthal order p - modes , hence , can not construct detailed enough kernels to unambiguously span the surface layers .",
    "nonetheless , we can make use of averaged quantities which dispense some of the rich information contained in the oscillation spectrum but still pose additional and useful constraints on the stellar model .",
    "such information is available from the _ averaged _ first- and second - order frequency spacings ( cf .",
    ", christensen - dalsgaard 1984 , p.  11 ) .",
    "the frequency spacings for have been calculated and analyzed extensively before ( guenther & demarque 1993 ; chaboyer et  al .",
    "they noted that mode bumping occurs in and that the irregular spacing associated with mode bumping could be used to pin down procyon s evolutionary phase .",
    "independent of the oscillation data , they also noted an inconsistency between the astrometric mass of procyon and the mass obtained from fitting their models to procyon s position in the hrd , with the latter turning out to be correct ( girard et  al . 2000 ) .",
    "in this paper we discuss what existing observational data can tell us about convective core overshoot , and we ask how future observational data , including seismic data , can help constrain the models further .    for all our models that fall within the error box",
    "we calculate the @xmath190 p - modes from radial order @xmath191 up to about @xmath192 using the non - radial pulsation code jig developed by ( 1994 ) .",
    "mode bumping for occurs at low radial orders between @xmath193  @xmath194 .",
    "mode bumping , also referred to as avoided crossings , occurs in more evolved stars when the molecular weight gradient left behind by nuclear burning leaves a barrier that traps g - modes in the core .",
    "when the frequencies of the g - modes increase , as the star evolves , they eventually cross through the frequencies of the lowest radial order p - modes . in regions of frequency overlap the modes mix , perturbing the frequencies .",
    "therefore , mixed modes contain extremely interesting information on core overshoot .",
    "since we are dealing with a resonance phenomenon very accurate stellar models are required .",
    "one of us ( d.b.g ) is exploring these possibilities in a subsequent paper .",
    "the p - modes with radial order greater than about @xmath194 show regular spacings in all our models .",
    "it is this information that is likely the first to be detected and measured accurately .",
    "the first order frequency spacings or large spacings are defined as @xmath195 it follows from ( 1980 ) asymptotic theory that high radial order modes are approximately equally spaced with @xmath196 where @xmath107 is the radius and @xmath197 is the sound speed . since the integrand is proportional to the inverse of the sound speed the large spacings are most sensitive to the outer layers of the star where @xmath197 is smallest .",
    "the spacings depend on the radius and the mass of the star with @xmath198 .",
    "can we improve on radius estimate by making use of the information provided by the large spacings ?",
    "indeed we can , as seen in [ fig : pm_large ] . here",
    "we plot the large spacings averaged over the range @xmath199 $ ] versus stellar radius for the order @xmath1 .",
    "each point in the diagram corresponds to a calculated stellar model with @xmath200 .",
    "the spread from a straight line shows the full set of model uncertainties due to different mass , overshoot , metallicity and mixing length parameters .",
    "we verified that models corresponding to the other convection prescriptions , i.e. , from @xmath201 and @xmath202 do not widen the spread .",
    "the spread is tight enough to improve on the radius by a factor of two for measured averaged large spacings @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",
    "the radius measurement in the range @xmath205-@xmath206 can be improved upon only with smaller improvement factors and it is impossible to do so in the range @xmath207-@xmath208",
    ". the @xmath209 modes could provide additional independent measurements but it turns out that there is more than one region where models cluster which leads to a wider spread .    since the large spacings are sensitive to the outer layers we do not expect them to be sensitive to different core overshoot .",
    "for different orders of @xmath210 we looked at the convective core size as a function of the averaged large spacings .",
    "the points scatter all over the diagram so no correlation between the large spacings and the convective core size exists .",
    "this fact is indeed fortunate if we want to use the large spacings for an independent measure of the stellar radius .",
    "the small spacings are defined by @xmath211 again , asymptotic approximations predict equal spacings proportional to an integral with an integrand of @xmath212 which increases with depth . thus , the small spacings are most sensitive to the interior where the integrand is largest .    therefore , we want to know whether the small spacings could be used to discriminate between different convective core sizes .",
    "we show the small spacings versus the core size , averaged over radial orders @xmath213 $ ] .",
    "if we look at the @xmath1 , @xmath200 models in [ fig : cz_small_l0 ] we see that for frequency spacings @xmath214 only models without overshoot can be found .",
    "in addition ,",
    "almost all subgiant models which can be identified as the ones exhibiting zero convective core sizes occupy exclusively the region @xmath215 .",
    "this result is robust , because it does not depend on the overshoot prescriptions since only tiny amounts of overshoot inhibit the subgiant models completely .",
    "thus , the averaged small spacings for @xmath1 might provide the necessary measurement needed to discriminate between the two evolutionary stages .    in comparison to the @xmath1 modes",
    "the @xmath216 frequency spacings are more influenced by the different amounts of overshoot . here ,",
    "overshoot leads to larger frequency spacings ( [ fig : cz_small_l1 ] ) . due to the spreads in parameter space",
    ", inferring the overshoot parameter or convective core size is difficult : if , for example , a frequency spacing of @xmath217 is measured , @xmath8 could be anywhere between zero and @xmath85 .",
    "the situation is more favorable for a measured frequency spacing of @xmath218 where one could infer an @xmath219 .",
    "as will be shown in the next section , the g - modes are better suited to yield a core size measurement .      although g - modes have never been detected conclusively in the sun ( appourchaux et  al .",
    "2000 ; wachter et  al .",
    "2003 ) , it may be possible to detect them in . the convection zone in the sun s atmosphere",

    "we hope that for existing and planned asteroseismic observations , some effort is made to detect g - modes in .      for all our models that fall within the error box",
    "we calculate the @xmath220 g - modes from radial order @xmath221 to about @xmath222 , @xmath223 , @xmath224 respectively with the non - radial pulsation code jig . in the following ,",
    "we use the full set of combinations , i.e. , full input parameter space and @xmath110 observational error box . as described in [ sec : consistobs ] we perform a pulsational analysis on five selected models within the error box , if possible . for one selected model , we show their periods as a function of radial order @xmath225 ( [ fig : gmode1 ] ) .",
    "there are a few gaps in the range of g - modes computed , an artifact of the automated search technique used by the pulsation program .",
    "this is of no consequence here since we are here only interested in computing the slope of the curves .",
    "we use a least - square algorithm to fit linear functions to the calculated gravity modes .",
    "the steepness of these lines gives the period spacings which can be explained by asymptotic theory ( [ sec : asymtheory ] ) .",
    "since asymptotic theory predicts a unique period spacing any scatter of calculated frequencies from a straight line indicates deviations from this theory .",
    "there is some scatter at very low @xmath225 where asymptotic theory does not hold and also where mode bumping is likely to occur .",
    "in addition , as can be seen in [ fig : gmode1 ] but is present in all calculated g - mode spectra , the scatter is larger for lower @xmath210 degree modes especially at high radial order .",
    "this scatter may well contain information about stellar structure beyond the information contained in the period spacing but we confine ourselves to the latter because the scatter is a quantity much more difficult to measure .      according to the asymptotic theory ( tassoul 1980 )",
    ", the period @xmath226 of low degree @xmath210 and high radial order @xmath225 ( @xmath227 ) is , to first order , given by ( unno et  al .",
    "1989 , p.83 ) @xmath228 with @xmath229^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath230 is the radius of the core convection zone , @xmath231 the radius at the bottom of the convective envelope and @xmath232 is the frequency .",
    "this formula establishes a regular period spacing @xmath233 which is given by @xmath234^{-1}\\ ] ] as can be seen by this formula , the higher degree @xmath210 modes do not hold additional information about the star s structure .",
    "the most important contributions to the integral in ( [ eq : pil ] ) come from the fully ionized inner regions of the star , hence the square of the frequency , @xmath235 , is well approximated by making use of the gradient of the mean molecular weight , @xmath236 , i.e. , @xmath237 \\label{eq : bruntv}\\ ] ] where we denote local gravitational acceleration @xmath238 , density @xmath34 , pressure @xmath239 , ratio of gas to total pressure @xmath47 , adiabatic gradient @xmath26 and actual stellar temperature gradient @xmath49 .",
    "the frequency gives the frequency by which a bubble of gas oscillates vertically around its equilibrium position under gravity .",
    "the frequency is therefore proportional to its restoring buoyancy force which is given by the spatial entropy gradient , or alternatively , by @xmath240 .",
    "another contribution to the frequency is given by the second term in brackets of ( [ eq : bruntv ] ) : the molecular weight gradient which can increase or decrease the frequency depending on the sign of @xmath51 .",
    "in the case of the late main - sequence star the frequency is largest in parts of varying molecular weight gradient which is left over from the receding core convection zone of main hydrogen burning ( [ fig : bruntvex ] ) . the molecular weight gradient for mass shells greater than about @xmath241 remain untouched and the buoyancy starts to dominate ( [ eq : bruntv ] ) .",
    "although buoyancy constantly increases toward the outer stellar layers the drop - off of density reduces its contributions to the frequency exhibiting a maximum around @xmath242 .",
    "these general characteristics are true for all our models irrespective of any overshoot , because this basic structure can be found in all late main - sequence stars that have convective cores .      with asymptotic theory ( [ sec : asymtheory ] )",
    ", we can gain further insight on how overshoot influences the g - mode period spacings . in order to show the differences in the frequency inscribed by different amounts of overshoot we show [",
    "fig : bruntvgl ] where we compare kct overshoot for two different overshoot parameters @xmath243 and @xmath244 .",
    "we recall , that since overshoot increases the size of the convective region it taps a larger hydrogen fuel reservoir .",
    "models which fall into the same error box and exhibit larger overshoot have not used up hydrogen as much and therefore the molecular weight gradient is shallower albeit increasing the period spacing @xmath245 .",
    "not so obvious at first glance but even more important is the inner cutoff radius @xmath230 which is larger for models with overshoot , reduces the frequency and therefore also increases the period spacing @xmath245 .",
    "these effects on the period spacings imply , that for given and fixed overshoot prescription and input parameters ( mass , metallicity , etc . ) a one - to - one relation between period spacings and convective core size could be made . on the other hand ,",
    "the situation here is more complicated since we must take a range of uncertainties into account .    here",
    "we present the relation between period spacings and convective core size in [ fig : mczpivgl1]-[fig : mczpivgl9 ] for all models of the full input parameter set that fall in the @xmath110 observational error box .",
    "we can see a strong albeit not perfect _ correlation of the period spacing with convective core size_. this can be used to measure the overshoot parameter within a given overshoot prescription provided it is possible to derive the period spacing from observational data . however , within the current uncertainties , this measurement is not extremely accurate . for adopted overshoot prescription and given value of the period spacings the derived overshoot parameter can be determined with an accuracy of @xmath246 ( ct1 ) , @xmath247 ( ct2 ) and @xmath248 ( ct3 ) . note that although the overshoot parameter @xmath10 can only be constrained within @xmath249 the overshoot extend measured in pressure scale heights is most favorably constrained with ct3 .",
    "we will see in the next [ sec : sensitivity ] what uncertainties need to be improved upon in order to be able to get a more constrained overshoot estimate .",
    "still , we can deduct valuable information about the convective core size , especially in certain period regions .",
    "whereas models without overshoot occupy the regions with period spacings of @xmath250 , @xmath251 and @xmath252 minutes the models with overshoot have generally longer period spacings .",
    "thus we find , that irrespective of the different overshoot prescriptions , there exists a period regime for models without overshoot that is cleanly separated from the overshoot cases .    for period spacings greater than @xmath253 , @xmath254 and @xmath255",
    "we get two different types of overlaps .",
    "first , for given adopted overshoot prescription and overshoot parameter , there is a spread due to the input model and observational uncertainties . as seen in [ fig : mczpivgl1]-[fig : mczpivgl9 ] these spreads constitute islands which correspond to a period regime which overlaps with neighboring ones .",
    "the less overlap the more accurate it is possible to determine the overshoot parameter from the period spacings .",
    "note that the overlap is stronger for the ct1 models when compared to the ct2 ones .",
    "the second overlap stems from the fact that we do not know the correct overshoot theory before hand .",
    "for example , if we look at the @xmath256 plots ( [ fig : mczpivgl2],[fig : mczpivgl5 ] ) at a period of 31 minutes with ct1 we get @xmath257 , on the other hand , with ct2 we determine @xmath258 .",
    "both types of overlaps could be reduced .",
    "the first one could be reduced by better observational data that is able to narrow down the error box and the set of input parameters .",
    "the most crucial observational parameters for this will be identified in the next [ sec : sensitivity ] .",
    "the second type of overlaps that result from the different overshoot prescriptions is even harder to overcome : when the outlined analysis presented here for is applied to many different , at least equally good constrained stars , it might be possible to do so in the future .      in the last section we demonstrated that , for a given convection prescription , uncertainties on our models imposed by both the observational error box and the possible initial input parameter space lead to overlaps in the period spacings thereby imposing uncertainties on future measurements of the overshoot parameter . for upcoming observations on it",
    "might be enlightening which parameters need to be constrained the most in order to be able to determine the overshoot parameter with more accuracy .",
    "first we want to determine the effects of narrowing the observational error box .",
    "to do so , we only allow those models to qualify as viable models that fall into the @xmath91 observational error box . as seen in [ fig : eboxtest ] the period spread occupied by the @xmath200 , @xmath256 , @xmath259 _ @xmath91 error box _ models ( triangles ) is not smaller compared to the full model set ( squares ) .",
    "thus , narrowing the error box to @xmath91 does not help in improving the accuracy of the overshoot parameter .",
    "next we assess the possible benefits arising from constraining one out of the five input parameters , i.e. , mass ( [ fig : rmtest ] ) , hydrogen fraction ( [ fig : rxtest ] ) , metallicity ( [ fig : rztest ] ) and mixing length parameter ( [ fig : ratest ] ) . as can be seen in the the most crucial input parameters turn out to be both the mass and the metallicity .",
    "measuring those two more precisely can bring down the spread by a factor of three .",
    "we have constructed a comprehensive set of stellar models for with varying model assumptions on mass , hydrogen content , metallicity , mixing length parameter , adopted core overshoot prescription and overshoot parameters in an effort to single out current and promising future observables that constrain the amount and possibly the nature of core overshoot in stellar interiors .    in this study ,",
    "effects of rotation have not been taken into account .",
    "is a slow rotator with a measured rotational velocity of @xmath260 .",
    "rotation is therefore expected to produce multiplets for higher azimuthal modes than the fundamental with splittings on the order of @xmath261 .",
    "this has to be kept in mind when comparing the predictions made here with actual observations .    the classical treatment of overshoot in stars  extending the core size by some fraction of the pressure scale height",
    " is merely a measure of overshoot and can not be regarded as an accurate description of the underlying physics . for this basic reason",
    "we implement a physically better motivated non - local convection theory developed by ( 1986 ) .",
    "we neglect a number of terms present in this theory , foremost its time - dependency and some others expected to be only important in evolutionary phases that must be followed on a dynamical timescale .",
    "more relevant to this study is the choice of the five free parameters present in the theory .",
    "reasonable choices on four can be made in analogy with mlt and we only vary one parameter , @xmath10 , which is the most relevant to the amount of overshoot .",
    "however , we stress that all parameters must be eventually calibrated , a task that might prove possible in the future if the methods presented in this paper are applied to many stars alike . regardless of the actual adopted numbers ,",
    "we do find a moderate increase of the amount of core overshoot with increasing stellar mass up to about @xmath5 . in comparison with kuhfu s original analysis",
    "we find smaller amounts of overshoot for the same adopted parameters mainly because we limit the pressure scale height in the stellar center .",
    "we are not certain , whether the implementation by ( 1987 ) omitted the molecular weight gradient which would constitute an additional reason why he found overall larger convective core sizes .",
    "we also show , that models calculated with the kuhfu convection theory contain convective core overshoot extents smaller than @xmath6 regardless of the overshoot parameter @xmath10 adopted .",
    "this behavior is rooted in the non - local treatment of the theory : since overshooting eddies transport internal energy farther out it also lowers the internal energy in deeper regions of the core .",
    "but the deep regions provide the driving necessary for overshoot to occur . thus we have two competing effects which lead to a limit for the extent of the core size and this limit matches the limit imposed by roxburgh s integral criterion .",
    "the current observational data of for its basic stellar parameters of mass , luminosity , radius and effective temperature constrain the amount of core overshoot in our models only marginally .",
    "models without overshoot are in accord with the observational error box and possible input parameters .",
    "our strong upper limits based on traditional stellar modeling for overshoot are @xmath262 and @xmath263 . by restricting the input parameters of mass , hydrogen , metallicity and mixing length to their @xmath91 levels we also determine weaker upper limits , i.e. , @xmath264 and @xmath265 .",
    "the convective core sizes of all models with kuhfu convection are much more constrained by the theory itself and not the observations",
    ".    could be in either the late main - sequence or the subgiant phase",
    ". however , only small amounts of overshoot of @xmath165 exclude the subgiant models as a viable possibility .",
    "we stress that the subgiant phase might be identified by the @xmath1 averaged small p - mode spacings .",
    "the identification of as a subgiant would in turn yield an extremely precise upper overshoot limit of @xmath266 .",
    "additional information might be extracted from averaged pulsation data . in certain frequency regions ,",
    "the spread of model uncertainties is narrow enough to use the averaged large @xmath1 spacings of the p - modes to improve on the currently known radius of procyon .",
    "improving the radius measurement by a factor of two will not lead to better estimates on the convective core size , since the largest uncertainties reside within the mass and metallicity parameters which we were able to show in our sensitivity study on the g - modes .",
    "certain frequency regions of the averaged small spacings are exclusively occupied by models without overshoot and in addition , the subgiant models are separated in the @xmath1 spacings .",
    "the p - mode separations due to overshoot are too small to give good estimates on the convective core size .",
    "extremely large overshoot might be detected , e.g. , @xmath267 .",
    "more direct measures of overshoot are hidden in the period spacings of g - modes . in comparison to the p - modes ,",
    "the separation of averaged period spacings due to different extents of overshoot is more pronounced , especially for the @xmath216 modes .",
    "when adopting @xmath200 the best possible determination of the core overshoot extent is within @xmath268 . for @xmath202",
    "the overshoot extent can be determined even more accurate within @xmath269 .",
    "again , most models without overshoot and in addition the subgiant models are nicely separated from the overshoot models . since the @xmath202 models have restricted core sizes , this theory could be falsified for very large period spacings .",
    "apart from these described certain regions , considerable confusion is added due to the different possible overshoot descriptions . at the moment , neither can we discriminate between the different theories nor can we get precise measurements of the overshoot parameter based on the averaged spacings alone . to improve on this situation",
    "we must bring down the model spreads by getting more precise values for the traditional stellar parameters , the most important in this case are the mass and the metallicity .",
    "the confusion due to different convection theories may be removed by similar analysis for a couple of equally well selected stars .",

    "<S> we present a comprehensive set of stellar evolution models for in an effort to guide future measurements of both traditional stellar parameters and seismic frequencies towards constraining the amount of core overshoot in and possibly other stars . </S>",
    "<S> current observational measurements of when combined with traditional stellar modeling only place a large upper limit on overshoot of @xmath0 . by carrying out a detailed pulsation analysis , </S>",
    "<S> we further demonstrate , how p- and g - mode averaged spacings can be used to gain better estimates of the core size . </S>",
    "<S> for both p- and g - modes , the frequency spacings for models without overshoot are clearly separated from the models with overshoot . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , measurements of the @xmath1 averaged small p - mode spacings could be used to establish evolutionary stage . for a fixed implementation of overshoot and under favorable circumstances , </S>",
    "<S> the g - mode spacings can be used to determine the overshoot extent to an accuracy of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> however , we stress that considerable confusion is added due to the unknown treatment of the overshoot region . </S>",
    "<S> this ambiguity might be removed by analyzing many different stars . a simple non - local convection theory developed by kuhfu </S>",
    "<S> is implemented in our stellar evolution code and contrasted with the traditional approaches . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this theory supports a moderate increase of the amount of convective overshoot with stellar mass of @xmath3 between @xmath4 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this theory places an upper limit on core overshoot extent of @xmath6 which matches the limit imposed by roxburgh s integral criterion . </S>"
