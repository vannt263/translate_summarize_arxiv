    "is formally defined as the variance of the linear matter density averaged over spheres with radius @xmath9 . ]",
    "the basic idea is this : in the high mass limit , the cluster mass function falls off exponentially with mass , with the fall - off depending sensitively on the amplitude of the matter density fluctuations .",
    "observing this exponential cutoff can thus place tight constraints on @xmath8 . in practice , however , the same exponential dependence that makes cluster abundances a powerful cosmological probe also renders it susceptible to an important systematic effect , namely uncertainties in the estimated masses of clusters .    because mass is not a direct observable , cluster masses must be determined using observable mass tracers such as x - ray emission , sz decrements , weak lensing shear , or cluster richness ( a measure of the galaxy content of the cluster ) . of course , such mass estimators are noisy , meaning there can be significant scatter between the observable mass tracer and cluster mass . since the mass function declines steeply with mass , up - scattering of low mass systems into high mass bins can result in a significant boost to the number of systems with apparently high mass @xcite . if this effect is not properly modeled , the value of @xmath8 derived from such a cluster sample will be overestimated .",
    "one approach for dealing with this difficulty is to employ mass tracers that have minimal scatter , thereby reducing the impact of said scatter on the recovered halo mass function .",
    "for instance , @xcite introduced a new x - ray mass estimator , @xmath10 , which in their simulations exhibits an intrinsic scatter of only @xmath11 , independent of the dynamical state of the cluster .",
    "use of a mass estimator with such low scatter should lead to improved estimates of @xmath8 from x - ray cluster surveys @xcite .",
    "such tightly - correlated mass tracers are not always available . in such cases ,",
    "determination of the scatter in the mass - observable relation is critical to accurately inferring the mass function and thereby determining cosmological parameters . of course , in practice , it is impossible to determine this scatter to arbitrary accuracy , but since the systematic boost to the mass function is proportional to the square of the scatter @xcite ( i.e. the variance ) , even moderate constraints on the scatter can result in tight @xmath8 constraints .    in this paper , we use optical and x - ray observations to constrain the scatter in the mass  richness relation for the maxbcg cluster catalog presented in @xcite .",
    "specifically , we use observational constraints on the mean mass  richness relation , and on the mean and scatter of the @xmath12richness relation , to convert independent estimates of the scatter in the @xmath13 relation into estimates of the scatter in the mass  richness relation .",
    "an interesting byproduct of our analysis is a constraint on the correlation coefficient between mass and x - ray luminosity at fixed richness . to our knowledge , this is the first time that a correlation coefficient involving multiple cluster mass tracers has been empirically determined .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : notation ] we lay out the notation and definitions used throughout the paper .",
    "section [ sec : data ] presents the data sets used in our analysis .",
    "in section [ sec : rough ] we present a pedagogical description of our method for constraining the scatter in the richness - mass relation , while section [ sec : formalism ] formalizes the argument .",

    "the scatter in @xmath21 at fixed @xmath15 is denoted @xmath22 , and the correlation coefficient between @xmath21 and @xmath23 at fixed @xmath15 is denoted @xmath24 .",
    "_ we emphasize that all quoted scatters are the scatter in the natural logarithm , not in dex . _",
    "note these parameters are simply the elements of the covariance matrix specifying the gaussian distribution @xmath25 . under our lognormal assumption for @xmath16 ,",
    "the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 are related via @xmath26    in this work , the quantities of interest are cluster mass @xmath27 , x - ray luminosity @xmath28 , and cluster richness @xmath29 . unless otherwise specified , cluster mass is defined as @xmath30 , the mass contained within an overdensity of 500 relative to critical .",
    "@xmath28 is the total luminosity in the rest - frame @xmath31 band , and @xmath29 is the maxbcg richness measure @xmath3 , the number of red sequence galaxies with luminosity above @xmath32 within an aperture such that the mean density within said radius is , on average , @xmath33 times the mean galaxy density assuming @xmath34 . likewise , unless otherwise stated all parameters governing the relations between @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 assume that @xmath27 is measured in units of @xmath35 , @xmath28 is measured in units of @xmath36 , and @xmath29 is measured in `` units '' of @xmath37 galaxies .",
    "for instance , including units explicitly , the mean relation between cluster mass and richness reads @xmath38 a hubble constant parameter @xmath39 is assumed through out .",
    ", our weak lensing masses scale as @xmath40 and the x - ray luminosities as @xmath41 . ] in addition , the weak lensing data presented in this analysis assumed a flat @xmath42cdm cosmology with @xmath43 .",
    "the recovered mass function has the standard hubble parameter degeneracy .",
    "in this work we use the public maxbcg cluster catalog presented in @xcite , which is an optically selected volume limited catalog of close to @xmath44 clusters over the redshift range @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "these clusters were found in @xmath46 of imaging data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) using the maxbcg cluster finding algorithm @xcite .",
    "this algorithm identifies clusters as overdensities of red sequence galaxies .",
    "all clusters are assigned a redshift based on the sdss photometric data only , and these redshifts are known to be accurate to within a dispersion @xmath47 .",
    "every cluster is also assigned a richness measure @xmath3 , which is the number of red sequence galaxies above a luminosity cut of @xmath32 and within a specified scaled aperture , centered on the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) of each cluster . only clusters with @xmath48",
    "are included in the final catalog .",
    "interested readers are referred to @xcite and @xcite for further details . in the interest of economy of notation , from now on we denote the maxbcg richness measure simply as @xmath29 .    the relationship between cluster richness and various well known mass tracers has been studied in large , homogeneous samples , such as 2mass @xcite and sdss @xcite",
    ". of particular interest to us are the weak lensing measurements of the mean mass as a function of richness , and the x - ray measurements of the mean and scatter of the x - ray luminosity as a function of richness .",
    "the former analysis has been carried out by @xcite based on the weak lensing data presented in @xcite , and independently by @xcite . in short , @xcite stacked maxbcg clusters within narrow richness bins , and measured the average weak lensing shear profile of the clusters .",
    "these shear profiles were turned into surface mass density contrast profiles using the redshift distribution of background sources estimated with the methods of @xcite and the neural net photometric redshift estimators described in @xcite .",
    "then , @xcite fit the resulting profiles using a halo model scheme to obtain tight constraints on the mean mass of maxbcg clusters for each of the richness bins under consideration .",
    "the @xcite analysis is very similar in spirit to the one described above .",
    "the main differences are the way the source redshift distribution is estimated , and the details of the model fitting use to recover the masses .",
    "the differences in the results between these two analysis are discussed in appendix [ sec : m - n_priors ] , where we use them to set priors on the mass  richness relation .",
    "the measurement of the mean x - ray luminosity of maxbcg clusters has been carried out by @xcite following an approach similar to that pioneered in @xcite .",
    "the necessary x - ray data is readily available from the rosat all - sky survey ( rass , * ? ? ?",
    "in short , @xcite stacked the rass photon maps @xcite centered on maxbcg clusters in narrow richness bins .",
    "the background subtracted stacked photon counts within a @xmath49 aperture were used to estimate the mean x - ray luminosity @xmath28 in the @xmath50 rest frame of the clusters .",
    "in addition , @xcite measured the scatter in x - ray luminosity at fixed richness by individually measuring @xmath28 for all maxbcg clusters with @xmath51 .",
    "it is worth noting that due to the shallowness of rass , many of the maxbcg clusters are not x - ray luminous enough to be detected individually . however , non - detection and upper limits for @xmath28 for individual systems were properly taken into consideration using the bayesian approach detailed in @xcite , and the recovered mean x - ray luminosity from this baysian analysis was fully consistent with the stacked means .",
    "in addition to the data sets above , we use the constraints on the @xmath13 relation from @xcite .",
    "these constraints are based on the 400d cluster x - ray survey , a flux limited cluster survey based on rosat pointed observations with an effective sky coverage of 397 @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "briefly , @xcite measured both the total soft band x - ray luminosity and the cluster mass for each cluster in the sample .",
    "x - ray luminosities are estimated from rosat data , and measure the luminosity in the rest - fram @xmath31 band , extrapolated to infinity assuming standard @xmath53 profiles .",
    "cluster masses are estimated based on the values of @xmath54 derived from followup chandra observations , though they note that the results they obtain using different mass tracers such as x - ray temperature and total gas mass are very similar .",
    "the @xmath55 relation is itself calibrated based on hydro - static mass estimates .",
    "importantly , @xcite explicitly correct for the malmquist bias expected for a flux limited cluster sample , so the @xmath13 relation they derive can be interpreted as the relation one would obtain using a mass limited cluster sample .    for this work , we have repeated the analysis in @xcite with a slightly different definition for @xmath28 . in particular",
    ", we measure the x - ray luminosity in the rest - frame @xmath31 band within a @xmath56 aperture .",
    "the change in band is tailored to match the energy band used by @xcite , which we used to place priors on the @xmath13 relation .",
    "it is worth noting that @xcite do not use a @xmath57 aperture , as we do .",
    "we have , however , carefully calibrated the scaling between our @xmath28 definition and that of @xcite so as to be able to use their results in our analysis.end a detailed description of our measurements can be found in appendix [ app : lx - n_priors ] .",
    "the problem we are confronted with is the following : we have four pieces of observational data , namely    * the abundance of galaxy clusters as a function of richness . * the mean relation between cluster richness and mass . * the mean and variance of the relation between cluster richness and x - ray luminosity . * the mean and variance of the relation between cluster x - ray luminosity and mass .    from this data , we wish to determine the scatter in mass at fixed richness for the cluster sample under consideration .",
    "the basic idea behind our analysis is as follows .",
    "consider the probability @xmath58 , which we take to be gaussian in @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "this probability distribution is completely specified by the mean and variance of both @xmath27 and @xmath28 at fixed richness , and by the correlation coefficient between @xmath27 and @xmath28 . of these",
    ", there are only two quantities that are not already observationally constrained : @xmath59 , the scatter in mass at fixed richness , and @xmath60 , the correlation coefficient between mass and @xmath28 at fixed richness .",
    "suppose now that we guessed values for these two quantities , so that the probability distribution @xmath61 is fully specified .",
    "given the abundance function @xmath62 , we can use @xmath61 to randomly assign a mass and an x - ray luminosity to every cluster in the sample .",
    "we can then select a mass limited sub - sample , and measure the corresponding @xmath13 relation , comparing it to the @xmath13 measurement from @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath13 relation we predict depends on our assumptions about @xmath61 , there should only be a small region in parameters space where our predictions are consistent with independent observational constraints on the @xmath13 relation .",
    "figure [ fig : contours ] illustrates this idea . to create the figure , we have set every observed parameter of the distribution @xmath61 to the central value of the priors described in appendix [ app : priors ] and summarized in table [ tab : priors ] .",
    "we then defined a grid in the two dimensional space spanned by @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and carried through the argument described above .",
    "the resulting predictions for the amplitude , slope , and scatter of the @xmath13 relation as a function of @xmath59 and @xmath60 are shown in the figure .",
    "we plot contours of constant amplitude , slope , and scatter of the @xmath13 relation as solid , dashed , and dotted lines respectively .",
    "the thicker curves correspond to the central values of the priors , while thinner curves demark the corresponding @xmath1 confidence limits .",
    "as we can see , all three contours intersect in a finite region of parameter space , indicating good agreement between our weak lensing and x - ray data , and the independent determination of the @xmath13 relation .",
    "based on figure [ fig : contours ] , we expect a detailed analysis should constrain our parameters to @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "the rest of this paper is simply a way of formalizing the argument described above in order to place errors on both @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "we wish to formalize the above argument in order to place quantitative constraints on the scatter in mass at fixed richness .",
    "details of how we go about doing so are presented below .",
    "readers interested only in our results can move directly to section [ sec : results ] .      as we mentioned above , the key point in our analysis",
    "is our ability to compute the amplitude and slope of the mean relation @xmath65 , and the scatter about this mean , as a function of our two parameters of interest : the scatter in mass at fixed richness and the correlation coefficient between @xmath27 and @xmath28 at fixed @xmath29 .",
    "let us define @xmath66 , and let @xmath67 denote our parameters of interest .",
    "our predictions for the @xmath13 relation as a function of our parameters of interest can be summarized simply as @xmath68 .",
    "now , adopting a bayesian framework , a set of priors on @xmath69 is simply a probability distribution @xmath70 .",
    "since @xmath69 is a function of @xmath71 , the priors immediately define a probability distribution over @xmath71 given by @xmath72 since we know how to compute both @xmath70 and @xmath68 , we can find any confidence regions for our parameters of interest .",
    "the problem we are confronted with , however , is slightly more complicated , in that the functions @xmath69 depend not only on @xmath71 , but also on additional nuisance parameters @xmath73 . indeed , our predictions for the observable parameters of the @xmath13 relation depend on both the abundance function of clusters and @xmath61 .",
    "the abundance function can be accurately described by a schechter function ( we explicitly checked a schechter function is statistically acceptable ) , @xmath74 given a schechter fit , our prediction for the @xmath13 relation will also depend on the value of the parameters @xmath75 and @xmath76 . likewise , the distribution @xmath61 also depends on the amplitude and slope of the means @xmath77 and @xmath78 , as well as the scatter in @xmath28 at fixed @xmath29 .",
    "all in all , we have six additional nuisance parameters @xmath79 .",
    "let @xmath80 denote the full set of parameters .",
    "the priors from the @xmath13 relation define a probability distribution over @xmath81 given by @xmath82 since we have a total of 8 parameters , and only three observables from the @xmath13 relation , it is obvious that the above likelihood function will result in large degeneracies because the parameters are under - constrained .",
    "if one has priors @xmath83 in the nuisance parameters , however , the probability distribution @xmath84 in the parameters of interest is given by @xmath85 this equation allows us to compute @xmath84 , and therefore place constraints on our parameters of interest . in practice",
    ", we will ignore the determinant term in the probability distribution defined in equation [ eq : prob ] .",
    "this is because the function @xmath86 is estimated using a monte carlo approach , implying that accurate numerical estimates of the jacobian @xmath87 would be too computationally intensive to be performed .",
    "fortunately , the determinant typically introduces only slight modulations of the likelihood , so we do not expect our results to be adversely affected by this .",
    "we estimate the probability distribution @xmath84 using a monte carlo approach . ignoring an overall normalization constant and setting @xmath88 , we have @xmath89 where @xmath90 for @xmath91 through @xmath92 are random draws of the nuisance parameters @xmath90 , drawn from the prior distribution @xmath93 .",
    "we set @xmath94 as our default value ( see below for further discussion ) .",
    "the prior distributions for our nuisance parameters are characterized by a statistical and a systematic error .",
    "the former is modeled as gaussian and the latter using a top - hat distribution .",
    "thus , given a prior of the form @xmath95 a random draw is obtained by setting @xmath96 where @xmath97 is drawn from a gaussian of zero mean with a covariance matrix defined by the statistical errors , and @xmath98 is drawn from a top hat distribution that is non - zero only for @xmath99 .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath100 used in equation [ eq : probestimator ] is the product of the likelihoods @xmath101 for each of the @xmath13 parameters @xmath102 .",
    "the probability for each @xmath13 parameter is given by the convolution of the top - hat and gaussian distributions defined by the statistical and systematic errors of @xmath103 , so that @xmath104\\ ] ] where @xmath105 note that the above equations are appropriate only when the various @xmath13 parameters are uncorrelated , so it is important to place the priors at the pivot point of the @xmath13 relation ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "this explains why table [ tab : priors ] quotes a prior on @xmath107 rather than on @xmath108 alone .",
    "we also need to specify how the function @xmath109 is evaluated .",
    "we do this using a monte carlo approach .",
    "given @xmath71 and @xmath73 , we generate @xmath110 mock clusters in the richness range @xmath111 $ ] .",
    "we then randomly draw mass and x - ray luminosity values for each of these clusters based on the distribution @xmath61 , and select a mass limited subsample of clusters using a mass cut @xmath112 with @xmath113 ( the reason for this particular value is explained below ) . using a least squares fitting routine",
    ", we find the best fit line between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "this defines both @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the scatter @xmath116 is defined as the root mean square fluctuation about the best fit line .",
    "using equation [ eq : probestimator ] and the function @xmath109 defined above , we evaluate the probability distribution @xmath84 along a grid of points in @xmath117 $ ] and @xmath118 $ ] with @xmath119 grid points per axis .",
    "a full run of our code then requires we perform @xmath120 monte carlo integrals with @xmath94 points in each integration .",
    "each draw also requires us to evaluate the function @xmath109 , which in turn requires generating a mock catalog with @xmath110 clusters , so the procedure as a whole is computationally expensive .",
    "to increase computational efficiency , for each monte carlo evaluation of @xmath84 we generate a single cluster catalog that is used to estimate the likelihood at every grid point .",
    "this correlates the values of @xmath121 along our grid , but does not otherwise adversely affect our results .",
    "our monte carlo approach requires that both the number of clusters in the random catalogs @xmath122 and the number of times the likelihood function is evaluated @xmath92 is sufficiently large to achieve convergence .",
    "our default values for @xmath122 and @xmath92 were selected to ensure the recovered likelihood is accurate to within a dispersion of @xmath123 inside high likelihood regions .",
    "the error in the recovered likelihood increases with decreasing likelihood , but even in the tails of the distributions our estimates are accurate to about @xmath124 .",
    "this was explicitly tested by running a coarse grid with our default values for @xmath92 and @xmath122 , and by repeating the analysis with both of these parameters increased by a factor of two .",
    ", one needs to generate cluster catalogs with @xmath125 clusters in order for the contours to appear smooth by eye .",
    "however , @xmath110 is a sufficient number of clusters for our analysis , since we only require that the noise in the likelihood be much smaller than the width of the priors .",
    "since the latter are quite wide , even relatively noisy estimates of the @xmath13 relation are sufficient for constraining the marginalized distribution . ]    finally , we emphasize that it is necessary to explicitly check whether our results are sensitive to the @xmath126 cut applied to the maxbcg clusters sample .",
    "in particular , when selecting a mass limited subsample of clusters , we need to ensure that the mass limit @xmath127 be sufficiently large that the number of clusters with @xmath128 and @xmath112 is insignificant .",
    "we have explicitly checked that for our adopted low mass cut @xmath129 our results are robust to the richness cut @xmath126 by repeating the analysis in a coarse grid using an @xmath130 richness cut instead .",
    "we find that the likelihood estimates in both cases are in agreement to within the expected accuracy of our monte carlo approach .",
    "the priors used in our analysis are summarized in table [ tab : priors ] .",
    "we follow the notation @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the central value , @xmath133 is the 1@xmath134 statistical error on the parameter @xmath135 marginalized over all other parameters , and @xmath136 is the systematic error . in all cases , we model statistical errors as gaussian , and we include known covariances between different parameters .",
    "systematic errors are assumed to follow top - hat distributions , and the final prior distribution is given by the convolution of these two functions .",

    "a detailed discussion of our priors can be found in appendix [ app : priors ] .",
    "figure [ fig : lkhd ] shows the @xmath156 and @xmath1 probability contours for the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the likelihood peak occurs at @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "the marginalized means are @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "we wish to determine whether the breadth of the likelihood region in figure [ fig : lkhd ] is limited by uncertainties in the scaling relations of maxbcg clusters , or by uncertainties in the @xmath13 relation .",
    "to do so , we repeat our analysis with two new sets of priors : for the first , we use a tight @xmath161 statistical prior on all nuisance parameters , but let the @xmath13 parameters float .",
    "the second set of priors uses a tight @xmath161 prior on each of the @xmath13 parameters , but floats all other nuisance parameters with the original priors .",
    "we find that using tight priors on our nuisance parameters has negligible impact on the likelihood regions recovered from our analysis . on the other hand ,",
    "the confidence regions obtained with the tight @xmath13 priors , shown in figure [ fig : lkhd ] as dashed curves , are tighter than those derived from our original analysis .",
    "thus , the dominant source of error in our analysis is the uncertainty in the values of the @xmath13 parameters .",
    "this can be easily understood based on figure [ fig : contours ] .",
    "we can see from the figure that the uncertainty in @xmath60 is largely due to the prior on the scatter in @xmath28 at fixed @xmath27 , which is already tight and thus does not change between our fiducial prior and our tight priors . on the other hand",
    ", we can see that both the amplitude and slope priors cut - off regions with high scatter .",
    "tightening these priors excludes a larger section of parameter space , and results in the tighter contours observed in figure [ fig : lkhd ] .",
    "figure [ fig : marg ] shows the marginalized probability distributions for @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the solid curves correspond to our original analysis , while the dashed curves illustrate the results one expects assuming our hypothetical tight priors for the @xmath13 relation parameters .",
    "we find that the logarithmic scatter in mass at fixed richness and the correlation coefficient between @xmath5 and @xmath4 are @xmath162 assuming our hypothetical tight @xmath13 priors , the constraints become @xmath163 and @xmath6 .",
    "we emphasize that these latter constraints are only meant as a guide to the accuracy one could achieve with this method if the @xmath13 relation were known to about @xmath164 accuracy .",
    "it is evident from our results that cluster richness is not as effective a mass tracer as x - ray derived masses . indeed ,",
    "even total ( i.e. not core - core excluded ) x - ray luminosity is a more faithful mass tracer than the adopted richness measure of the maxbcg catalog , as demonstrated both by the smaller scatter and the very large correlation coefficient . note that the latter indicates that , at fixed richness , over - luminous clusters are almost guaranteed to also be more massive than average .",
    "this is an important result which forms the basis for a concurrant paper in which we improve our richness estimates by demanding tighter correlations in the @xmath12richness relation  @xcite .",
    "there are not many previous results against which our measurements of scatter in mass at fixed richness may be compared .",
    "one possible reference point is the upper limit based on the error bar in the weak lensing mass estimates of @xcite .",
    "more specifically , assuming that the error in @xmath77 is entirely due to the intrinsic scatter in @xmath27 at fixed @xmath29 , it follows that the error in the mass is simply @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the observed error and @xmath62 is the number of clusters with richness @xmath29 . for the richest bin , which provides the tightest constraint , @xcite find @xmath167 .",
    "the bin contains @xmath168 clusters , so an upper limit to the scatter in mass at fixed richness is @xmath169 .",
    "figure [ fig : marg ] shows that our results easily satisfy this upper limit on the scatter .",
    "the only other measurement of the scatter in mass at fixed richness for maxbcg clusters is that found in @xcite .",
    "these scatter estimates are obtained as follows : first , @xcite select all maxbcg clusters whose central galaxy has a spectroscopic redshift .",
    "they then bin the clusters in richness , and compute the velocity relative to the bcg of every galaxy member with spectroscopic data .",
    "the recovered velocity distribution of galaxies is found to be non - gaussian .",
    "assuming that the velocity distribution of galaxies of halos of fixed mass is exactly gaussian , and that the observed non - gaussianity is entirely due to mass - mixing within a richness bin , @xcite estimate the scatter in mass at fixed richness based on the observed non - gaussianity of the velocity distribution .",
    "an updated version of the results from @xcite can be seen in figure [ fig : compare ] .",
    "the only difference between this plot and the corresponding figure in @xcite is that here we have made used of the additional spectroscopic data from the sdss data release 6 @xcite , which results in tighter error bars .",
    "also shown in the figure as a horizontal band is the @xmath1 confidence region from our analysis .",
    "as we can see , our scatter estimate appears to be systematically lower than that of @xcite , a discrepancy first noted in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* more on the relation between our work and theirs below ) .",
    "such a bias is not entirely unexpected , as we now know that a significant fraction of cluster have their bcgs miss - identified , a problem that was not yet known  and was therefore unaccounted for  at the time the @xcite results came out . to get a better understanding of how our results and those of @xcite compare , we can use our results along with the miscentering probability model from @xcite to predict the scatter",
    "that @xcite observed given this miscentering systematic .",

    "first , we use our best fit model for the abundance distribution to generate a mock catalog with @xmath170 clusters with @xmath126 .",
    "each of these clusters is assigned a mass by drawing from the @xmath171 distribution defined by the values of @xmath59 corresponding to the two @xmath1 confidence limits on @xmath59 .",
    "these assigned masses are then turned into velocity dispersions using the scaling relation from @xcite .    at this point",
    ", we have a cluster catalog where each cluster has a richness and a velocity dispersion .",
    "if a cluster is miscentered , we expect that in most cases the new center will be a cluster galaxy .",
    "assuming this is the case , and that bcgs are at rest at the center of a cluster , the velocity dispersion of cluster galaxies relative to random satellites will be a factor of @xmath172 high than relative to the bcg . using the miscentering model described in @xcite for @xmath173 , the probability that",
    "a cluster of richness @xmath29 be correctly centered , we randomly label clusters as properly centered or miscentered , and boost their `` observed '' velocity dispersion for those clusters labeled as miscentered by the expected amount .",
    "the clusters are assigned a new mass based on their `` observed '' velocity dispersions , and the corresponding scatter in the @xmath174 relation is estimated .",
    "we repeat this procedure @xmath175 times in order to compute the mean systematic correction due to miscentering .",
    "our predictions for the scatter values observed by @xcite are shown in figure [ fig : compare ] with dashed lines , and correspond to the @xmath1 confidence interval from our analysis .",
    "we see that miscentering introduces a richness dependent correction that boosts the scatter in the recovered velocity dispersion and places it in significantly better agreement with the data from @xcite .",
    "the agreement with the @xcite data is an interesting result .",
    "perhaps the single most difficult systematic effect that had to be addressed in the @xcite analysis is the validity of the assumption that non - gaussianities in the velocity distribution of stacked clusters are entirely due to mass - mixing is a valid .",
    "the reasonable agreement between our results and those of @xcite suggests that their assumption is indeed justified , though a robust conclusion will have to wait until a more detailed analysis is performed , especially given the possibility of velocity bias of the galaxy population ( i.e. if satellite galaxies have a velocity dispersion different from that of the dark matter ) .",
    "the analysis in this work is also very closely related to that of @xcite .",
    "@xcite sought to constrain the @xmath13 relation of clusters by fitting the scaling of @xmath78 with @xmath77 .",
    "however , as recognized in @xcite , in order to fully interpret their result in terms of the traditional definition of the @xmath13 relation , i.e. the mean x - ray luminosity at fixed mass , one needs to know both the scatter in mass at fixed richness , and the corresponding correlation coefficient with @xmath28 .",
    "given that these two quantities are unknown , but that the @xmath13 relation is already constrained from x - ray surveys , it seems reasonable to suggest that a better use of the lensing and x - ray data of maxbcg clusters is to use our knowledge of the @xmath13 relation to constrain the scatter in mass at fixed richness and the corresponding correlation coefficient , as was done in this work .",
    "our work differs from the ideas presented in @xcite in another significant way .",
    "while our analysis employs only @xmath176 and @xmath62 , @xcite used the halo mass function @xmath177 and the probability distribution @xmath178 to interpret their measurements .",
    "this has the important drawback that in doing so , one needs to assume a cosmological model in order to compute the halo mass function , rendering their interpretation cosmology dependent . by focusing on the quantities that are directly observable , i.e. @xmath62 and @xmath176",
    ", we are able to avoid this difficulty .",
    "the price we pay for this is that rather than constraining the scatter in richness at fixed mass , which is the more directly relevant quantity from a cosmological perspective , we constrain instead the scatter in mass at fixed richness . while this makes implementing such a constraint a little more cumbersome in a cosmological analysis , the fact that the constraint itself is cosmology independent is obviously of paramount importance .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , to obtain an unbiased estimate of the halo mass function based on the observed cluster richness function requires that we understand the scatter between cluster richness and halo mass .",
    "given our lognormal assumption , and the fact that the mean mass  richness relation is already known from weak lensing , our measurement of the scatter in this scaling relation fully determines the probability distribution @xmath171 .",
    "thus , we are now in a position to determine the halo mass function of the local universe with the maxbcg cluster catalog .",
    "let us define then @xmath179 as the number of halos within a logarithmic mass bin of width @xmath180 centered about @xmath181 , @xmath182 given our cluster catalog and @xmath171 , we construct an estimator @xmath183 for @xmath184 by randomly drawing a mass from @xmath171 for each halo in the cluster catalog , and then counting the number of halos within the logarithmic mass bin centered about @xmath181 .",
    "note that since the mass of each cluster is a random variable , our mass function estimator @xmath183 is itself a random variable .",
    "the mean and correlation matrix of @xmath183 can easily be obtained by making multiple realizations of @xmath183 , and averaging the resulting mass functions .    in practice",
    ", we also need to marginalize our results over uncertainties in @xmath171 and over uncertainties in the richness function @xmath62 .",
    "to do so , we randomly draw the parameters @xmath185 , and then resample of the cluster richness function to obtain a new estimate of @xmath184 .",
    "the whole procedure is iterated @xmath186 times , and the mean and covariance matrix of the number counts in each of our logarithmic mass bins is computed .",
    "is large enough for our results to be insensitive to the maxbcg richness cut @xmath126 . ]",
    "figure [ fig : mf ] shows the mass function recovered through our analysis . to turn our number counts into a density",
    ", we assumed a wmap5 cosmology @xcite , with @xmath43 and @xmath187 , and a photometric redshift error @xmath188 ( used for computing the effective volume of the sample ) .",
    "the diamonds correspond to our estimated means , and the error bars are the square root of the diagonal elements of the correlation matrix .",
    "we emphasize that the error bars are heavily correlated .",
    "the mean and covariance matrix of the recovered halo mass function can be found in appendix [ app : mfdata ] .",
    "also shown in figure [ fig : mf ] with dotted lines are the halo mass functions at @xmath7 predicted by wmap5 assuming the @xcite mass function . for both curves",
    ", we set all cosmological parameters to the central values reported in @xcite , except for @xmath8 , which is set to @xmath189 for the upper curve and @xmath190 for the lower curve .",
    "these two values define the @xmath1 confidence interval for @xmath8 in @xcite .",
    "as we can see , the mass function recovered from our analysis is fully consistent with the wmap5 cosmology , though it seems to push for values of @xmath8 on the high end of their allowed region .",
    "a detailed cosmological analysis of our data will be presented in a subsequent paper ( rozo et al , in preparation ) .",
    "we have shown that by combining the information in the maxbcg richness function , the mean richness - mass relation , the mean and scatter of the @xmath12richness relation , and the mean and scatter of the @xmath13 relation , we can constrain both the scatter in mass at fixed richness for maxbcg clusters , as well as the correlation coefficient between mass and @xmath28 at fixed richness .",
    "we find @xmath162 these constraints are dominated by uncertainties in the @xmath13 relation , and can be significantly tightened if our understanding of the @xmath13 relation improves .",
    "we also found our results are consistent with those presented in @xcite once miscentering of maxbcg clusters is taken into account .",
    "our lower limit on the correlation between @xmath27 and @xmath28 at fixed richness constitutes the first observational constraint on a correlation coefficient involving two different halo mass tracers .",
    "note that the large correlation between @xmath28 and @xmath27 implies that @xmath28 - even without core exclusion - is a significantly better mass tracer than the maxbcg richness estimator ( i.e. at fixed richness , over - luminous cluster are nearly always more massive ) .",
    "this is an important result , which we use in a concurrent paper to help us define new richness estimators that are better correlated with cluster mass  @xcite .    using our results , and assuming @xmath43 and @xmath39 , we have estimated the halo mass function at @xmath7 , corresponding to the median redshift of the cluster sample .",
    "we find that our recovered mass function is in good agreement with the mass function predicted by @xcite for the wmap5 cosmology @xcite .",
    "a detailed cosmological analysis will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( rozo et al , in preparation ) .",
    "our work sheds new light on the interrelationship of bulk properties of massive halos .",
    "we have used weak lensing , x - ray luminosities , and optical richness estimates to constrain the scatter in the richness - mass relation , which can lead to improved cosmological constraints . in principle",
    ", one could also turn this question around , and , assuming cosmology , we could constrain the scatter in the richness - mass relation , which would then allow us to place constraints on the amplitude , slope , and scatter of the @xmath13 relation .",
    "such an analysis would be interesting in that , by doing so , one could compare the predicted amplitude of the @xmath13 relation to that derived from hydrostatic mass estimates , thereby directly probing the amount of non - thermal pressure support in galaxy clusters .",
    "note that even though this question can also be directly addressed by comparing weak lensing and x - ray mass estimates of individual clusters , the analysis suggested here would benefit from having small uncertainties , whereas projection effects result in rather noisy weak lensing mass estimates for individual systems .",

    "note the systematic offsets are allowed to be both positive and negative , since the correction multiplier @xmath204 above could easily be larger than unity rather than smaller than unity .",
    "our priors on the @xmath174 relation are based on the results presented in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . to assign our priors , we first compare the results of these two works as a means of assessing systematic uncertainties in the mass parameters .",
    "we then focus exclusively on the @xcite results to place our final priors on the @xmath174 relation .",
    "the latter choice reflects the fact that @xcite report weak lensing mass estimates for several mass definitions , among them @xmath30 , the relevant quantity in the @xmath13 relation of @xcite .",
    "let us then begin by discussing the @xcite results first . while @xcite quote a power - law fit for the mean mass at fixed @xmath77 , this fit is based a non - public version of the maxbcg catalog that extends to a richness of @xmath209 ( the catalog for clusters with @xmath210 is not public ) . since the maxbcg catalog is only known to be highly complete and pure in the range @xmath126 , we have refit the @xcite masses restricting ourselves to the range @xmath211 .",
    "this slightly lower cut is necessary due to the richness binning in @xcite .",
    "we find that the mass @xmath212 within a 180 overdensity threshold relative to mean matter density is @xmath213 with a correlation coefficient @xmath214 between the amplitude and slope parameters .",
    "@xcite preformed a similar but independent weak lensing analysis of the maxbcg clusters , though using @xmath215 as their mass variable .",
    "they find @xmath216 to compare against the @xcite values , we use the @xcite mass conversion formulae to find an approximate power law relation between @xmath215 and @xmath212 over the range @xmath217 .",
    "we find @xmath218 , which is only a @xmath219 correction . applying this correction",
    ", we find that the corresponding @xmath174 parameters from @xcite are @xmath220    we find that the slopes of the @xcite and @xcite results are nearly identical , but that the masses of @xcite are systematically higher by @xmath221 .",
    "this difference can be traced back to how the lensing critical surface density for each of the two works is estimated .    in general ,",
    "lensing masses are proportional to the quantity @xmath222 , where @xmath223 is the lensing critical surface density , and the average is to be computed over the source redshift distribution . given multi - band photometric data @xmath224 for each galaxy , one way to compute @xmath225 is to use a photometric redshift estimator @xmath226 , and then assume that the true source redshift distribution is identical to the photometric redshift distribution . @xcite have shown that such a simple approach typically results in biased lensing mass estimates , but they also demonstrate that it is possible to achieve unbiased results using the probability distribution @xmath227 .",
    "the weak lensing analysis in @xcite , on which the results from @xcite are based , falls somewhere in between these two approaches .",
    "while @xcite does in fact make use of photometric redshifts , they do not simply assume that the source redshift distribution is identical to the photometric redshift distribution . rather , they construct a probability distribution @xmath228 , and use this probability to estimate @xmath225 . as it turns out , evaluating @xmath225 in this way leads to results that are nearly identical to those obtained by simply setting @xmath229 .",
    "thus , even though the approach used in @xcite is more sophisticated than the simple case considered in @xcite , we expect the @xcite results to be biased but correctable as prescribed in @xcite .",
    "this correction amounts to a boost of the lensing masses by a factor of @xmath230 .",
    "the statistical error bar in the correction is added in quadrature to the statistical error bar from our fit , which results in @xmath231\\times ( n/20)^{1.18\\pm 0.09 } \\label{eq : johnston_mass}\\ ] ] these new values for the @xcite data are in considerably better agreement with those of @xcite .",
    "there remains , however , a systematic @xmath164 difference between the two amplitudes , as well as a small difference @xmath232 between the two slopes .",
    "a possible culprit for this systematic @xmath164 offset is the difference in how miscentering is accounted for in the data models .",
    "the word miscentering refers to the fact that when finding clusters , one will inevitably find clusters that are improperly centered , either due to failures of the cluster finding algorithm , or simply because there is no obvious center of the cluster based on its optical image .",
    "such offsets between the true and assigned centers are problematic because if a cluster is miscentered , the corresponding lensing signal is weakened , resulting in systematically low mass estimates .    to determine whether the remaining offset between @xcite and @xcite is consistent with differences in the miscentering model , we refit our data assuming no errors on the miscentering corrections .",
    "we find @xmath233 with a correlation coefficient @xmath234 .",
    "note that these errors are smaller than the errors quoted before , as they should be , given that this new fit does not marginalize over a wide range of miscentering models . by subtracting the two sets of errors in quadrature , we find that the miscentering priors adopted in @xcite correspond to an error @xmath235 in the amplitude and @xmath161 in the slope .",
    "thus , the @xcite mass measurements are well within the centering error included in the analysis of @xcite .    nevertheless , it is unclear whether miscentering can in fact account for the difference between the @xcite and @xcite results .",
    "more specifically , @xcite also performed their analysis including the @xcite model for miscentering , and find after applying the centering correction their best fit @xmath236 relation becomes @xmath237 comparing this to equation [ eq : johnston_mass ] , we find including a miscentering correction in the @xcite analysis increases the tension between the two results .",
    "moreover , it suggests that the difference between the two results is due to some other form of systematic difference between the two analysis pipelines . in light of this",
    ", we opt for introducing a systematic correction to the @xcite results of @xmath238 and @xmath239 for the amplitude and slope respectively .",
    "we also introduce systematic errors of the same magnitude as this systematic correction , so that our final result is @xmath240(n/20)^{1.13\\pm 0.09\\ ( stat ) \\pm 0.05\\ ( sys)}.\\ ] ] note the central values of the original @xcite analysis ( corrected for photometric redshift bias ) as well as the @xcite results both with and without miscentering corrections are all encompassed by our systematic error .",
    "now , in this work we are interested more in the @xmath241 ( henceforth simply @xmath174 ) relation than in the @xmath242 relation , since it is the former mass which is accessible to x - ray studies .",
    "to constrain the @xmath174 relation we use the quoted @xmath30 mass measurements from @xcite , re - scaling their @xmath243 errors to @xmath30 by assuming the relative errors are constant .",
    "a fit to the data results in @xmath244 ( n/40)^{1.11 \\pm 0.08}\\ ] ] with a correlation coefficient @xmath245 .",
    "we now boost this expression by factor @xmath246 due to the photometric redshift bias correction , and add the systematic corrections @xmath238 and @xmath239 to the amplitude and slope respectively as per our discussion of the @xmath236 relation .",
    "we also include a systematic error on the amplitudes and slopes of this same magnitude .",
    "we obtain @xmath247    the final systematics we consider here are the purity and completeness of the sample .",
    "now , as long as the completeness is not correlated with mass , completeness should not in any way bias the recovered parameters of the @xmath174 relation , though it obviously affects the error bars due to lower statistics .",
    "the same can not be said of purity .",
    "if only a fraction @xmath248 of the clusters are actually good matches to real halos in the universe , then a fraction @xmath249 of the clusters will have a lensing signal that is significantly different from the mean signal . as an extreme case",
    ", we can consider what happens if a fraction @xmath249 of the clusters had no mass associated with them . in that case",
    ", the observed mean mass is simply @xmath250 where @xmath251 is the true mean , so one should boost the observed masses by a factor of @xmath252 to obtain an unbiased estimate . for @xmath253 ,",
    "this amounts to an increase in @xmath140 of magnitude @xmath254 .",
    "now , @xcite showed that the purity of the maxbcg cluster sample is expected to be above @xmath203 over the range or richnesses considered here , and the increase in @xmath140 quoted above is undoubtedly an overestimate of the necessary correction since even false cluster detections will have excess mass associated with them . in light of this , we have adopted a one - sided systematic error bar @xmath255 to take into account the impact of purity in the recovered @xmath174 relation .",
    "the error bar is one sided since we expect impurities will tend to decrease the observed mean mass .",
    "we can , however , turn this prior into a normal double - sided prior by including a systematic correction @xmath256 to the central value , and setting the systematic error bar to the same magnitude as the central value shift .",
    "we can also get a rough estimate for the systematic error on the purity by assuming that the quoted systematic error in the amplitude should be made only in the limit of high or low richness .",
    "if that were the case , using the fact the slope is measured over a decade of richness values , the corresponding slope would be @xmath257 which amounts to a systematic offset @xmath258 .",
    "these systematic error bars are added linearly to our previous systematic error .",
    "our final set of priors for the @xmath174 relation is @xmath259 with a correlation coefficient @xmath245 between the two statistical errors .",
    "the priors in the @xmath260 relation come from repeating the analysis described in @xcite , but with @xmath28 defined as the x - ray luminosity in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band , and corrected for aperture effects .",
    "as in @xcite , we restrict this analysis to clusters with @xmath261 .",
    "we begin by measuring the stacked mean @xmath260 relation and scatter on a fixed @xmath262 scale @xmath263 where we have measured @xmath28 in units of @xmath264 , with a pivot point of @xmath265 .",
    "we emphasize that the scatter determined above is the total scatter in the observed @xmath260 relation that can not be attributed to poisson uncertainties in the rosat photon counts .",
    "in particular , the quoted scatter is affected by possible point source contamination , agn activity , cool cores , cluster mergers , etc .",
    "there are multiple systematic errors that can affect the derived parameters for the @xmath260 relation .",
    "these include photometric redshift errors , evolution of the richness parameter @xmath29 , uncorrelated point sources , cluster mis - centering , and cluster agn and cool cores .",
    "in addition , we need to account for the fraction of cluster flux lost due to our finite aperture and the rass psf , in order to compare our results with the luminosity measurements of @xcite .",
    "we shall now discuss each of these possible systematic effects .",
    "@xcite find that the accuracy of the maxbcg photo - z estimates is high enough such that any biases are insignificant relative to the statistical uncertainty of the parameter determinations , and can thus be safely ignored .",
    "however , @xcite did find significant redshift evolution in the @xmath260 relation , well above the expected self - similar evolution .",
    "similar redshift evolution is found in @xcite ; the reason for the systematic undercounting of cluster members at high redshift is explained in @xcite .",
    "we have estimated the effect of this redshift evolution on our derived scatter parameter via a simple monte carlo , and confirm that although the apparent evolution is strong , it is insignificant relative to the intrinsic scatter .",
    "therefore , we may also safely ignore this possible systematic effect .",
    "we now take a combined approach to the systematic effects due to cluster mis - centering , a finite aperture , the rass psf and uncorrelated point sources . the first three effects are strongly related , in that they all tend to scatter cluster photons out of our initial fixed @xmath262 aperture , and these may affect the normalization , slope , and scatter in the @xmath260 relation .",
    "uncorrelated point sources should not affect the mean relation because the large number of stacked sources smooths out the foreground and background .",
    "however , when uncorrelated point sources are aligned with individual clusters they may increase the measured scatter by boosting the apparent @xmath28 .",
    "we have estimated the effects of these systematics by running a monte carlo with simulated rass data on top of random backgrounds selected from the area of the rass photon map that overlaps with the maxbcg mask .",
    "we first resample the maxbcg richness function 100 times .",
    "each cluster is given a redshift drawn from the maxbcg redshift distribution , as well as a random postion on the sky selected from the area of the rass survey that overlaps with the maxbcg mask .",
    "after we select the richest 1000 clusters in each realization , each cluster is given a luminosity based on the mean relation from eqn .",
    "[ eqn : lxnmean ] and an input intrinsic scatter , @xmath266 .",
    "each cluster luminosity is then converted to a number of photon counts according to the rass exposure at the given point , and scattered by poisson uncertainties .",
    "then , each cluster is given a position offset according to the maxbcg miscentering distribution described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see   4.3 ) .",
    "the cluster profiles are assumed to follow a @xmath53 model , @xmath267 . to ensure we are on similar footing as @xcite",
    ", we randomly assign each cluster @xmath53 model parameters uniformly in the range @xmath268 and @xmath269 . finally , the photons are scattered according to the rass psf , following the method of ( * ? ? ?",
    "we then calculate the stacked mean relation and scatter as described in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : lnsystematics ] summarizes the results from our systematic tests .",
    "the x - axis shows the input intrinsic scatter , @xmath270 .",
    "the y - axis shows the ratio of the input parameter to output parameter for the normalization @xmath144 ( circles ) , slope @xmath146 ( diamonds ) , and scatter @xmath148 ( squares ) .",
    "we note that when @xmath271 then @xmath272 , which can not be displayed on the plot .",
    "this is consistent with our expectation that uncorrelated sources may boost the observed scatter , especially with low intrinsic scatter .",
    "overall , we find that ( a ) the slope @xmath146 is not significantly biased ; ( b ) at moderate to large scatter ( @xmath273 ) the intrinsic scatter @xmath148 is not significantly biased ; and ( c ) the output normalization @xmath144 must be boosted by a factor of @xmath274 to account for the flux lost to miscentering , the finite aperture , and rass psf effects .",
    "our priors become then @xmath275 in addition to these corrections , we also need to take into account systematic uncertainties due to purity and completeness in the sample . just as with the weak lensing",
    "mass estimates , completeness should not affect the measured @xmath260 relation , whereas purity will tend to suppress the x - ray luminosity at fixed richness . following the same procedure as in appendix [ sec : m - n_priors ] ,",
    "we derive systematic errors @xmath276 and @xmath277 , which we add linearly to our previous systematic error estimates .",
    "finally , we have repeated our scatter analysis using not just the 1000 richest clusters , but also the 2000 richest clusters , in which case we find @xmath278 . to take into account this variation in our analysis",
    ", we also introduce a systematic error @xmath279 .",
    "our final set of priors is @xmath280      as discussed in section [ sec : rough ] , our analysis hinges on the fact that we can use prior knowledge about the @xmath13 relation to constrain the @xmath174 relation . here",
    ", we use the results of @xcite to put priors on the @xmath13 relation , which may be summarized as , as appropriate for the maxbcg sample . ]",
    "@xmath281 we report a prior on @xmath107 because at @xmath282 the @xmath13 parameters derived from the @xcite sample are correlated . to decouple them , one needs to shift to the statistical pivot point @xmath283 and introduce the scatter dependence quoted above ( vikhlinin , private communication ) .",
    "these constraints are derived from chandra observations of clusters in the 400d cluster catalog @xcite , which allowed @xcite to measure @xmath54 and thereby infer cluster mass using the @xmath55 relation .",
    "this relation was itself calibrated on a cluster subsample for which masses were derived using the standard hydrostatic equilibrium argument .",
    "this last point is very important , since simulations suggest that hydrostatic mass estimates of clusters may be biased low by @xmath284 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one way to calibrate such uncertainties is to compare weak lensing mass estimates to hydrostatic mass estimates .",
    "there are several examples of this type of approach .",
    "for instance , @xcite have performed such an analysis using the weak lensing mass estimates of @xcite , and find @xmath285 a similar analysis has been carried out by @xcite , who used the weak lensing mass estimates of @xcite and their own analysis of chandra public data to obtain @xmath286 . finally ,",
    "using xmm x - ray observations and the weak lensing data of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , @xcite find @xmath287 .",
    "@xcite also note , however , that a histogram of @xmath288 peaks at a ratio of @xmath289 , and that clusters in the tails of the distribution tend to have tight error bars , possibly biasing the error weighted ratio . in light of this , we have opted for a `` middle of the road '' approach , and introduce a correction factor @xmath290 .",
    "our corresponding prior is @xmath291 estimating systematic errors in @xmath152 and @xmath154 is difficult .",
    "for instance , comparisons with weak lensing masses are not an effective way of assessing systematics because weak lensing mass estimates are so noisy : trying to fit a power law relation between @xmath292 and @xmath293 results in very large errors for the slope of the relation .",
    "one alternative is to consider multiple studies of the @xmath13 relation in order to asses how sensitive the recovered parameters are to the analysis pipeline .",
    "unfortunately , such an excercise is far from trivial .",
    "one difficulty is the fact that there is very little agreement on the meaning of @xmath28 , with many works focusing on core - excised and/or core - corrected bolometric x - ray lumunisoties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even among those works that also explore the @xmath13 relation when @xmath28 is a soft x - ray band luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there are still important differences in the aperture used to estimate @xmath28 . in principle",
    ", we could attempt to convert between the various definitions of @xmath28 to try to compare the works against each other , but many of these @xmath13 measurements are affected by malmquist bias , making comparisons to the @xcite results difficult .    one work that does constrain the the soft x - ray band , non - core excised , malmquist bias corrected @xmath13 relation is @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the energy band they use is slightly different from that of of @xcite , so even here comparison is not trivial .",
    "we expect , however , that at least the scatter and slopes of the @xmath13 relation will not be strongly affected by the minor differences between the two @xmath28 definitions . given our purposes , the interesting thing about the @xcite results is that they use a very different methodology for constraining the @xmath13 relation . in particular , they assume knowledge of cosmological parameters , and then use the observed cluster x - ray luminosity function to constrain @xmath294 . assuming their `` compromise cosmology '' , which they argue gives the best results , they find @xmath295 and @xmath296 .",
    "these values are in excellent agreement with those of @xcite , and suggest that placing additional systematic errors in the @xmath13 parameters is not really necessary at this point .",
    "table [ tab : mfdata ] presents the mean and covariance matrix of the mass function data derived from our analysis .",
    "these results represent the state of the art mass function measurements at low redshift from optically derived cluster catalogs .",
    "we emphasize we assumed @xmath43 and @xmath39 , so appropriate rescaling must be applied if the results are to be compared against significantly different cosmologies .",
    "note that the covariance matrix data in table [ tab : mfdata ] is normalized such that the diagonal entries are the fractional error @xmath297 , while the off diagonal entries are the correlation coefficients @xmath298 .",
    "we present the data in this way since it is easier to understand when expressed this way .",
