    "the problem of how to construct a bivariate random vector @xmath2 with log - normal marginals @xmath3 , @xmath4 and correlation coefficient @xmath5 is well known in the history of dependence modeling , partially because of its relevance to risk management practice .",

    "now , almost 20 years later , copulas are a well established tool to quantify dependence in multivariate data and to construct new multivariate distributions .",

    "nevertheless , dependence is still summarized in terms of numbers [ as opposed to ( copula ) functions ] , so - called _ measures of association_. although there are various ways to compute such numbers in dimension @xmath6 , measures of association are still most widely used in the bivariate case @xmath7 .",
    "a  popular measure of association is tail dependence .",
    "it is important for applications in quantitative risk management as it measures the strength of dependence in either the lower - left or upper - right tail of the bivariate distribution , the regions quantitative risk management is mainly concerned with .",

    "this lack of linearity can also help to understand why tail - dependence matrices are realized by models based on bernoulli vectors as we have seen in this paper , in contrast to covariance matrices which are naturally realized by gaussian ( or generally , elliptical ) random vectors .",
    "the latter have a linear structure , whereas bernoulli vectors do not .",
    "it is not surprising that most classical techniques in linear algebra such as matrix decomposition , diagonalization , ranks , inverses and determinants are not very helpful for studying the compatibility problems we address in this paper .",
    "concerning future research , an interesting open question is how one can ( theoretically or numerically ) determine whether a given arbitrary nonnegative , square matrix is a tail - dependence or bernoulli - compatible matrix . to the best of our knowledge there are no corresponding algorithms available .",
    "another open question concerns the compatibility of other matrices of pairwise measures of association such as rank - correlation measures ( e.g. , spearman s rho or kendall s tau ) ; see @xcite , section  6.2 .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite studied the concept of tail - dependence functions of stochastic processes .",
    "similar results to some of our findings were found in the context of max - stable processes .    from a practitioner s point - of - view , it is important to point out limitations of using tail - dependence matrices in quantitative risk management and other applications .",
    "one possible such limitation is the statistical estimation of tail - dependence matrices since , as limits , estimating tail dependence coefficients from data is nontrivial ( and typically more complicated than estimation in the body of a bivariate distribution ) .    after presenting the results of our paper at the conferences `` recent developments in dependence modelling with applications in finance and insurance2nd edition , brussels ,",
