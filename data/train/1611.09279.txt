    "in @xcite , motivated by the desire to understand the @xmath7-vectors of various classes of posets , skandera and reed showed that one can canonically label the elements of a unit interval order from @xmath8 to @xmath1 so that its @xmath9 antiadjacency matrix has all its minors nonnegative and its zero entries form a right - justified young diagram located strictly above the main diagonal and anchored in the upper - right corner .",
