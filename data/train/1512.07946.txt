    "the population inversion of quantum states has been investigated for its application to lasing  @xcite .",
    "the quantum control of atoms and molecules also has been investigated to realize the population inversion  @xcite .",
    "recently , studies of the super - tonks - girardeau gas , which also involves the population inversion , has attracted a lot of attention in both experimental and theoretical studies of nonequilibrium cold atoms  @xcite . in the super - tonks - girardeau gas , which may be described by the lieb - liniger model  @xcite with strongly attractive interaction ,",
    "the population inversion is created through an `` adiabatic '' process , where the interaction strength is suddenly flipped from infinitely repulsive to infinitely attractive  @xcite .",
    "such a population inversion can be induced even by an adiabatic cycle , which can be obtained with an extension of the adiabatic process that connects tonks - girardeau and super - tonks - girardeau gases both to weaker repulsive and weaker attractive regime .",
    "the repetitions of this adiabatic cycle transform the ground state of non - interacting bosons into their higher excited states and achieve the population inversion  @xcite .",
    "this is counterintuitive , since there is no external field to drive the final state of the bosons away from the initial state .",
    "there has been studies of the excitation of quantum systems by adiabatic cycles , which is referred to as the exotic quantum holonomy  @xcite .",
    "we also mention , in studies of atomic and molecular systems under the oscillating field , that an adiabatic cycle involving a level crossing may excite a quantum system  @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we examine an adiabatic cycle that excites a system consisting of bose particles confined in a one - dimensional box . during the cycle , we vary an additional wall adiabatically , while the interparticle interaction is kept fixed .",
    "this is in contrast to the scheme described in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the interaction strength between bose particles is an effective adiabatic parameter . in this study",
    ", we suppose that the wall is described by a @xmath0-function shaped potential  @xcite .",
    "we show that the first excited one - particle state is occupied by all the bosons to achieve the population inversion completely , if the system is prepared to be in the ground state .",
    "namely , the energy gained by the bosons during the adiabatic cycle is proportional to the number of bosons .",
    "in order to examine @xmath1 bose particles in a one - dimensional box with an additional @xmath0-wall , we review the single particle case , i.e. , @xmath2  @xcite , where the system is described by the hamiltonian @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the particle mass , @xmath5 is the confinement potential , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the strength and position of @xmath0-wall . in particular , we assume that @xmath5 describes an infinite square well with the length @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath9 for @xmath10 and @xmath11 otherwise  @xcite .",
    "we introduce an adiabatic cycle @xmath12 , which consists of three adiabatic processes @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , as shown in figure  [ fig : box ] .",
    "we suppose that the @xmath0-wall is initially absent , i.e. , @xmath16 in , and that the system is in a stationary state initially . in the first part of @xmath12 , which will be called as @xmath13 , an impenetrable wall is inserted at @xmath17 adiabatically . in terms of the @xmath0-wall , the strength @xmath6 is slowly increased from @xmath18 to @xmath19 , while its position @xmath7 is fixed at @xmath17 during @xmath13 .",
    "subsequently , in the second part @xmath14 , the position @xmath7 of the impenetrable wall is adiabatically changed from @xmath17 to @xmath20 . in the last part @xmath15 ,",
    "the @xmath0-wall at @xmath21 is adiabatically turned off . at the end of the cycle @xmath12",
    ", the @xmath0-wall has no effect , again . in figure",
    "[ fig : n1 ] , we depict the parametric dependence of eigenenergies of the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath22 along @xmath12 . throughout this manuscript",
    ", we indicate the eigenenergy @xmath23 using a normalized wavenumber @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the ground eigenenergy of the particle in the infinite square well .",
    "the adiabatic time evolution of the single - particle system along @xmath12 depends on @xmath17 and @xmath20 . in the following ,",
    "we explain the case @xmath27 , which may be explained from figure  [ fig : n1 ] .",
    "a more rigorous argument is found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "first , let us consider the case that the initial state is the ground state @xmath28 of the particle in the infinite square well , where @xmath29 denotes the @xmath30-th adiabatic eigenstate of @xmath22 during processes @xmath31 and @xmath15 .",
    "we will omit to indicate @xmath32 in the following .",
    "after the completion of @xmath31 , the state vector arrives at @xmath33 , the ground state of the right well , since we choose the right well in @xmath14 is slightly larger than the left well . during @xmath14 , there occurs a spectral degeneracy between @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the ground state of the left well .",
    "this is because the size of the left ( right ) well is increasing ( decreasing ) during @xmath14 , and these sizes coincide at @xmath35 . at the end of @xmath14",
    ", @xmath33 becomes the first excited state , which adiabatically continued to @xmath36 , which is the second excited state of the particle in the infinite square well , through @xmath15 .",
    "hence the `` population inversion '' in the single - particle system occurs if the system is prepared to be in the ground state initially .",
    "second , we examine the case that the initial state is the first excited state @xmath36 , which offers the `` inverse '' of the population inversion . through the adiabatic cycle @xmath12 , the system arrives at @xmath34 after the completion of @xmath37 , and then arrives at @xmath38 at the end of the cycle @xmath12 .",
    "namely , either @xmath38 and @xmath36 return to the initial states after the completion of the adiabatic cycle @xmath12 twice .",
    "third , let us examine the cases that the initial states are @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which are the first and second excited state , respectively .",
    "now @xmath12 induces an interchange of these two states , through the intermediate states @xmath41 and @xmath42 , which are localized the right and left well during the process ii .",
    "a similar interchange of initial eigenstates occurs as a result of the adiabatic cycle @xmath12 , as long as we choose @xmath17 and @xmath20 appropriately . in general , the level crossing of the one - particle hamiltonian   during the process @xmath14 plays an important role to determine which pairs of eigenstates are interchanged by @xmath12 , while there is no level crossing generically during the processes @xmath43 and @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "we make a remark on the stability of the present scheme for the one - body population inversion .",
    "a crucial point is the stability of the adiabatic time evolution across the level crossing during @xmath14 .",
    "the level crossing may be lifted due to an imperfection of the impenetrable wall , i.e. , the @xmath0-wall with an infinite strength .",
    "if the level splitting is small enough , we may employ the diabatic process around the avoided crossing to realize the one - body population inversion .",
    "it has been shown that an open diabatic process made of time - dependent potential well produce the second excited state from the ground state of a bose particle  @xcite .",
    "this diabatic scheme is applied to create collective excitations of interacting bosons  @xcite .",
    "we examine the case that the number of the bose particles is @xmath1 , assuming the absence of interparticle interaction .",
    "it is straightforward to extend the above result for @xmath2 , once we restrict the case that @xmath1 bosons initially occupies the one - particle state @xmath44 .",
    "hence the system is in an adiabatic state of the @xmath1 bosons @xmath45 where the one - particle adiabatic state @xmath44 is occupied by @xmath1 bosons , during @xmath13 and @xmath15 .",
    "if there is no interparticle interactions , the parametric evolution of averaged wavenumber @xmath24 for the adiabatic @xmath1-particle state agree with the one of the single - particle system .",
    "this suggests that the adiabatic cycle @xmath12 of the @xmath1-particle system with no interaction delivers the ground state @xmath46 to the excited state @xmath47 , i.e. , the complete population inversion , as is seen in figure  [ fig : n1 ] .",
    "the energy that the particles acquire during the cycle @xmath12 is proportional to the number of the particles .",
    "we examine the adiabatic cycle @xmath12 for @xmath1 interacting bose particles .",
    "we mainly examine the case that the system is initially in the ground state . in order to confirm that the @xmath1-particle population inversion really occurs , we need to examine the effect of the interparticle interaction .",
    "we assume that the interparticle interaction @xmath48 consists of two - body contact interactions .",
    "namely , we suppose that @xmath48 takes the following form @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the interaction strength , and the summation is taken over pairs .",
    "we also assume that the interparticle interaction is weak enough so that the topology of the parametric dependence of eigenenergy remain unchanged , except around the level crossing points of the noninteracting bosons .",
    "namely , when the gaps of the eigenenergies between neighboring levels in the noninteracting system are larger than a constant value , the interparticle interaction shifts the eigenenergy at most @xmath51 , according to the standard perturbation theory . for small enough perturbative energy correction , the corresponding adiabatic time evolution of the stationary state of the interacting bosons closely follows the one of the noninteracting bosons .    accordingly , under the weak interparticle interaction condition , the eigenstates of the interacting bosons can be labeled by the quantum numbers of the noninteracting bosons .",
    "for example , the ground state of the initial and final points of the adiabatic cycle @xmath12 may be denoted as @xmath52 , whose overlapping integral with the unperturbed state @xmath46 is large .",
    "also , @xmath52 can be constructed by the standard perturbation theory with a small parameter @xmath50 .    on the other hand , even a weak interparticle interaction can strongly influence the parametric evolution of energy levels in the vicinity of level crossings by making avoided crossings .",
    "hence we need to closely examine the level crossing of the non - interacting bose particles .    in the following ,",
    "we argue that the adiabatic time evolution closely follows the one in the noninteracting system examined above , if the number of the particle is large enough .",
    "the key is the selection rule for the matrix element of @xmath48 in the adiabatic representation in the vicinity of the level crossings of non - interacting bosons .",
    "we show that the effect of the interparticle interaction is significantly different , depending on whether a level crossing locates either in @xmath14 , or in @xmath54 , as for the two body case . in the former case ,",
    "the relevant matrix elements may be small since it involves only tunneling processes through the impenetrable wall .",
    "on the other hand , in processes @xmath31 and @xmath15 , the matrix element can not be negligible .",
    "however , it turns out that there happens to be no corresponding level crossing that affects the population inversion whose initial state is the ground state .",
    "the parametric evolutions of eigenenergies of the noninteracting two particle system are depicted in figure  [ fig : n2 ] , in terms of the averaged wavenumber @xmath24 ( see , ) .",
    "the parametric evolution of the eigenenergy that connects @xmath55 and @xmath56 has a level crossing with two eigenenergies during @xmath14 .",
    "the initial states of these energy levels are @xmath56 and @xmath57 , which are @xmath58 and @xmath59 during @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "we examine the matrix elements of the interparticle interaction term @xmath60 between the adiabatic basis vectors @xmath61 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "note that @xmath61 corresponds to the initial state @xmath55 of the adiabatic cycle @xmath62 for example .",
    "since the single - particle adiabatic eigenfunctions @xmath63 and @xmath64 are completely localized in the left and right wells , respectively , the overlapping integral is zero , if the @xmath0-wall is completely impenetrable during @xmath14 .",
    "the level crossing accordingly remains even in the presence of the interparticle interaction .",
    "thus the adiabatic cycle @xmath12 induces the complete population inversion from @xmath55 to @xmath56 , as in the non - interacting case .",
    "let us examine the case that the @xmath0-wall during @xmath14 allows the tunneling leakage of particles due to some imperfections .",
    "still , we may expect that the matrix elements due to the tunneling corrections are exponentially small .",
    "since the resultant energy gap of the avoided crossing is also exponentially small , we may expect that the diabatic process easily almost recovers the complete population inversion .    also , during the second process @xmath14 , the left and right part of the well",
    "may be separated .",
    "this allows us to make the tunneling correction arbitrarily small .",
    "accordingly the adiabatic limit that follows the extremely small avoided crossing would be difficult to realize .",
    "on the other hand , if the level crossing appears during @xmath31 or @xmath15 , the interparticle interaction destroys the level crossing . in figure",
    "[ fig : n2 ] , such an example is seen between the levels whose initial states are @xmath65 and @xmath66 , which is delivered to @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively , in the absence of @xmath60 .",
    "the matrix element @xmath69 does not vanish in general , since the relevant single - particle adiabatic eigenfunctions extend the whole box .",
    "accordingly the level crossings are destroyed to form avoided crossing .",
    "thus the adiabatic process @xmath31 for example , delivers @xmath65 and @xmath66 at the initial point of @xmath31 , to @xmath68 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "this breaks the population inversion whose initial state is a higher excited state , e.g. , the adiabatic cycle @xmath12 delivers @xmath65 to @xmath70 in the absence of the interparticle interaction .      here",
    ", we show that the interparticle interaction do not suppress the population inversion for @xmath72 due to a selection rule of @xmath60 .",
    "we explain this with the case @xmath73 ( figure  [ fig : n3 ] ) .",
    "let us examine the level whose initial state is @xmath74 along @xmath12 .",
    "the corresponding final state is @xmath75 in the absence of the interparticle interaction .",
    "first , the interparticle interaction has no , or exponentially small effect on the level crossing during @xmath14 , as shown in the case of @xmath53 .",
    "second , we examine the level crossing in @xmath15 , where the levels whose final states are @xmath75 and @xmath76 exhibit crossing . we examine the matrix element of the interparticle interaction @xmath77 , which vanishes since @xmath60 is a two - body interaction , and the set of quantum numbers @xmath78 and @xmath79 has no common quantum number .",
    "still , there may be a tiny avoided crossing whose magnitude can be explained by the standard second - order perturbation theory .",
    "we may expect that the diabatic process induces the complete population inversion whose final state is @xmath75 .",
    "also , even if the interaction strength @xmath50 is moderately large , where the topology of the level diagram remains unchanged except that the avoided crossing becomes noticeable , the final state should be @xmath76 , whose energy is far larger than the ground state . in this sense",
    ", a incomplete population inversion should be realized .",
    "we shall prove that the adiabatic cycle @xmath12 delivers @xmath46 to @xmath47 for @xmath80 , even in the presence of the two - body interparticle interaction .",
    "here we explain the selection rule for arbitrary @xmath1 ( @xmath81 ) , and examine each part of the cycle @xmath12 . for example , @xmath82 case is shown in figure  [ fig : n4 ] .",
    "we explain the selection rule of the two - body interparticle interaction for @xmath80 .",
    "namely , we examine the matrix element @xmath83 .",
    "the matrix element vanishes when the two sets of quantum numbers @xmath84 and @xmath85 has , at least , three different elements , i.e. , the number of the common quantum numbers is equal to @xmath86 or less . in other words ,",
    "non - vanishing matrix element has the following @xmath87 where @xmath88 are the common quantum numbers .",
    "we examine the first part @xmath31 of @xmath12 .",
    "we assume that the system is initially in the ground state @xmath52 .",
    "according to the selection rule , it is sufficient to examine @xmath89 , where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are single particle adiabatic states , e.g. @xmath36 .",
    "now we examine whether the eigenenergies of these states are degenerate .",
    "this is equivalent to compare the eigenenergies corresponding to @xmath55 and @xmath92 of the two particle system .",
    "as is seen in figure  [ fig : n2 ] , there is no level crossing in @xmath31 . in this sense",
    ", there is no effective level crossing with the level @xmath52 , during @xmath31 .    as for @xmath15",
    ", we conclude from a similar argument above , that the energy level corresponding to @xmath93 has no effective level crossing .",
    "next we examine @xmath14 , where the system is in @xmath94 . according to the selection rule",
    ", it suffices to examine @xmath95 with single particle adiabatic states @xmath90 and @xmath91 . to clarify the level crossing",
    ", we compare @xmath61 with @xmath92 .",
    "there are three cases .",
    "first , the levels corresponding to @xmath61 and @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) do not occur .",
    "second , the levels corresponding to @xmath61 and @xmath98 exhibits a degeneracy only when @xmath99 and @xmath100 , where the corresponding matrix element involves a single - particle tunneling .",
    "third , the levels corresponding to @xmath61 and @xmath101 exhibits a degeneracy only when @xmath99 and @xmath100 , where the corresponding matrix element involves a two - particle tunneling .",
    "since the matrix elements involving a tunneling contribution is exponentially small , the resultant gap should be also small .",
    "hence the diabatic process should occur even when the speed of the impenetrable wall is moderately slow .",
    "we here argue that the experimental realization of the population inversion suggested in this paper is feasible with the current state of the art .",
    "for example , we may utilize the scheme  @xcite to realize @xmath0-wall with an approximate gaussian wall .",
    "another possibility is to use a heavy particle as a wall , whose position may be manipulated by , say , an optical tweezer . the effective interaction between the wall particle and other particle may be tuned by external fields .",
    "we note that the present scheme may offer a way to realize another exotic nonequilibrium states .",
    "let us suppose , for example , the state of bosons is in @xmath102 , which can be generated from the adiabatic cycle @xmath12 . after",
    "the interparticle interaction @xmath50 is adiabatically increased to @xmath19 , the system arrives the higher excited state of the tonks - girardeau system , which may be described by the lieb - linigher model with the infinite interparticle interaction strength  @xcite .",
    "similarly , after @xmath50 is adiabatically decreased to @xmath103 , the system now arrives at the higher excited state of the super - tonks - girardeau system  @xcite .",
    "this state is a much more highly - excited state compared to the super - tonks - girardeau state , because the initial state @xmath102 is a higher excited state of noninteracting bosons . in summary",
    ", we have shown that the adiabatic cycle @xmath12 induces the nearly complete population inversion of the multi - boson system , when the interparticle interaction is not too strong . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite for a single particle case , the present scheme may be extended to the case of an arbitrary shape of the confinement potential @xmath5 .",
