    "technologically relevant magnetic materials such as diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) are characteristically strongly disordered due to the low concentration of random magnetic moments ( e.g. @xmath8 where 5% - 12 % of the ga sites are occupied by substituent mn ions ) .",
    "dms materials such as @xmath9 have been modeled theoretically using a classical heisenberg model on an fcc lattice where the hamiltonian is @xmath10 with @xmath11 being a carrier ( hole ) mediated random indirect exchange coupling between moments separated by a distance @xmath12 given by @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "@xmath14 is the fermi wave number , @xmath15 is the hole density , and @xmath16 is the damping scale .    while individual parameters such as the ferromagnetic transition temperature @xmath7 have been calculated in theoretical studies  @xcite , the critical behavior of strongly disordered heisenberg models on a three dimensional lattice has not been understood in detail in the context of a direct numerical calculation . at the ferromagnetic transition , thermodynamic quantities scale as power laws in the reduced temperature @xmath17 with , e.g. , the magnetization varying as @xmath18 , the correlation length scaling as @xmath19 , and @xmath20 for the magnetic susceptibility ; hence critical exponents such as @xmath4 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 ( up to prefactors specific to the model under consideration ) completely specify the critical behavior near @xmath7 where @xmath21 .",
    "our task is to determine the extent to which the critical behavior of the three dimensional heisenberg model is influenced by disorder ( in the form of randomly removed magnetic moments ) , and we have found the most singular contributions to critical behavior to be unaffected by disorder whether only a few magnetic moments are removed or the majority of magnetic impurities are missing in cases of strong disorder . a theoretical result ( derived from a renormalization group calculation ) known as the harris criterion",
    "@xcite holds that the sign of the specific heat exponent @xmath22 determines whether the critical exponents are altered . specifically ,",
    "although modifications in the universality class are expected for @xmath23 , the harris criterion predicts that disorder will not affect the critical exponents when @xmath24 .",
    "the hyper - scaling identity @xmath25 implies that the condition for stable critical behavior is @xmath26 , @xmath27 being the dimensionality of our system . in particular",
    ", since @xmath28 for the heisenberg model  @xcite , the harris result precludes disorder induced shifts in the critical exponents . with careful finite size scaling analysis , we have indeed confirmed that critical behavior in the disordered models conforms to the 3d heisenberg universality class .",
    "an important finding of our detailed numerical study is , however , the fact that the effective critical exponents of the strongly disordered model may very well manifest an apparent violation of the harris criterion ( i.e. a deviation from the corresponding pure heisenberg model values ) away from the critical temperature , thus possibly considerably complicating the interpretation of experimental data . \"    the results of our numerical calculations are consistent with experiment where the local critical behavior of thermodynamic quantities such as the magnetic susceptibility @xmath29 ( e.g. the slope @xmath30 of the log - log plot in the case of the magnetic susceptibility ) differ from the critical indices of the pure case with @xmath31 for intermediate values of the reduced temperature .",
    "ultimately , the effective critical exponents converge for sufficiently small @xmath32 to the critical behavior of the model with no disorder .",
    "similarly , we examine finite size systems , and we would obtain results for critical behavior which differ from those of the pure model if we extrapolate to the bulk limit in nave manner . however , by taking into account corrections to scaling , we compensate for finite size effects and obtain critical exponents identical to those of the pure heisenberg model .    using large - scale monte carlo simulations , we calculate critical exponents for the disordered heisenberg model on a 3d lattice . hence , we show that the universality class remains unaltered from regimes where the model is weakly disordered and only a few magnetic moments are removed to cases such as @xmath33 ( the site percolation threshold for the simple cubic lattice is @xmath34 where on average fewer than half of the magnetic ions participate in a ferromagnetically ordered phase ) .",
    "another component of the harris criterion is the prediction that thermodynamic variables such as the magnetization @xmath35 and magnetic susceptibility @xmath29 do ( do not ) self - average at @xmath7 in the bulk limit when @xmath36 .",
    "the extent of self - averaging may be quantified via the parameter @xmath37   - [ \\langle m^{2 } \\rangle]^{2})/ [ \\langle m^{2 } \\rangle ] ^{2}$ ]  @xcite , the relative variance of @xmath38 $ ] with respect to disorder where @xmath35 is the magnetization , angular brackets indicate thermal averages , and square brackets refer to disorder averaging . for the heisenberg model ,",
    "we find self - averaging to be intact with @xmath39 ultimately decreasing after reaching a maximum for moderate sized systems containing on the order of a few hundred magnetic impurities .    in section",
    "ii , we discuss details of our numerical techniques for determining critical behavior of the disordered heisenberg model .",
    "subtleties include the need for a careful calculation of the curie temperature @xmath7 , and taking into account corrections to scaling which would otherwise lead to the conclusion that disorder has affected the critical behavior of the heisenberg model ; we find that the universality class is not influenced by disorder , being identical to that of the pure model .    in section iii , we give results in tabular form for the critical exponents obtained in our calculation .",
    "explicit numerical values are given for the critical indices @xmath1 , @xmath4 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 for disorder ranging from very weak ( e.g. @xmath40 ) to quite strong ( i.e. @xmath33 ) .",
    "in each case , we also provide the corresponding critical exponent ( calculated by us ) for the pure model , which is consistent with the best and most recent values given in the literature .    in section iv",
    ", we provide the apparent critical exponents which differ from those of the pure model , and would be obtained for system sizes that are not sufficiently large .",
    "similarly , if one is not close enough to @xmath7 in experiment ( generally , the reduced temperature @xmath41 should be less than @xmath42 to obtain the critical exponents of the pure heisenberg model in systems with disorder ) , spurious apparent critical indices will be measured .",
    "this apparent violation of the harris criterion , even very slightly away from the critical temperature , is an important cautionary remark following directly from our monte carlo studies of the disordered model .",
    "finally , in the appendix ( section v ) , we provide the monte carlo numerical results for thermodynamic variables such as the magnetization @xmath35 and magnetic susceptibility @xmath29 .",
    "also included are the corresponding theoretical results taking into account leading singular terms , as well as the first correction to scaling .",
    "there is very good agreement between the monte carlo data and the results of the theoretical model ( i.e. generally at least one part in @xmath43 or better ) .",
    "singularities in variables such as the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility are smoothened as @xmath44 and the correlation length @xmath45 becomes comparable to the system size @xmath46",
    ". however , we can determine critical exponents by exploiting finite size scaling at @xmath7 ; the magnetization scales at @xmath47 , the thermal derivative @xmath48 of the correlation length @xmath45 varies as @xmath49 , and the magnetic susceptibility @xmath29 diverges with increasing system size @xmath46 with the singular dependence @xmath50 - [ \\langle m \\rangle ] ^{2 } ) \\propto l^{\\gamma/\\nu}$ ] .",
    "the critical exponents @xmath1 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are obtained by calculating the appropriate thermodynamic quantities for many different system sizes and carefully extrapolating to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "having calculated @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath4 , one may obtain additional critical exponents such with the aid of hyperscaling relations .",
    "as an example , the exponent @xmath3 , given in terms of @xmath2 and @xmath1 by @xmath53 , is useful because it is a more sensitive parameter than @xmath2 alone in gauging the universality class of a specific model .    to obtain critical exponents accurately ,",
    "it is essential that calculations be performed as close as possible to @xmath7  @xcite since the temperature range where finite size scaling holds becomes narrower with increasing system size @xmath46 . to obtain the ferromagnetic transition temperature @xmath7 as precisely as possible",
    ", we numerically calculate the normalized correlation length @xmath54 following reference  @xcite . for temperatures below @xmath7",
    ", @xmath54 ultimately increases with increasing @xmath46 , while above the curie temperature @xmath54 eventually decreases .",
    "we find @xmath7 by insisting that @xmath54 tend to a constant value for very large system sizes ( i.e. containing at least on the order of @xmath55 spins ) where finite size effects are negligible . in this manner",
    ", we obtain @xmath7 to within one part in @xmath56 .",
    "alternatively , we may examine the binder cumulant @xmath57/3 [ \\langle m^{2 } \\rangle ] ^{2}$ ] .",
    "another approach for locating the ferromagnetic transition temperature which we have used and obtained the same curie temperature results is to examine moderate size systems where finite size effects are a more important systematic effect , and to use the binder cumulant @xmath58 in conjunction with the normalized correlation length @xmath54 to accurately calculate @xmath7 .",
    "finite size effects preclude a precise determination of @xmath7 with either technique alone ; the intersections will actually scale as @xmath59 for the binder cumulants and @xmath60 for the normalized correlation length , respectively .",
    "nevertheless , by examining two different system size pairs , one may cancel the leading order corrections from finite size scaling . in this manner , we have calculate curie temperatures to within one part in @xmath56 for each impurity concentration we have examined .",
    "@xmath7 results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] for disorder strengths ranging from the pure cased ( @xmath31 ) to the site percolation threshold ( @xmath34 ) appropriate to the 3d simple cubic lattice ; the monte carlo statistical error is much smaller than the size of the symbols in the graph .",
    "the specific @xmath7 values used in the monte carlo calculations of singular thermodynamic quantities appear in table  [ tab : squeeze ] ; the reciprocals @xmath61 are given as well .",
    ".[tab : squeeze ] @xmath7 values ( with the uncertainty in the last digit for each concentration @xmath63 given ) .",
    "the @xmath7 results are given in units of @xmath64 , whereas the inverse temperatures @xmath65 are expressed in terms of @xmath66 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     discussions with victor galitski and michael fisher are gratefully acknowledged .",
