    "the study of food webs has recently attracted the interest of complex systems scientists as one of the clearest example of a network structure whose property can only be understood by looking at the system as a whole . a food web is the collection of the predation relations in an environment and assumes naturally the form of a network that is a mathematical object composed by vertices ( the biological species ) and their edges ( the predation relations ) .",
    "such a structure is very widespread and can be recovered with similar statistical properties in a variety of other situations from www@xcite and the internet@xcite to protein interactions@xcite and social systems@xcite . despite this similarity , food webs represent one of the most interesting cases of study for their particular topology .",
    "for example vertices can be divided in classes thanks to their biological meaning ( i.e. prey / predators ) .",
    "also , the structure is naturally layerized when considering the minimum distance of species from the external resources .",
    "all these properties make these structures extremely interesting for testing models and algorithms related to complex networks . similarly , some of the ideas developed in the area of computer science turned out to be useful in the case of food webs , signalling some biological meaning hidden in this topology@xcite .    traditionally , the most important quantities in a food web are the number of vertices @xmath0 and the number of edges @xmath1 .",
    "since the maximum number of edges you may have in such a system grows as @xmath2 ( precisely @xmath3 for a directed graph ) one also considers the density of edges @xmath4 , a quantity known in ecology as the _ directed connectance_. the edges are directed and each of them follows the convention ( based on the flux of nutrients ) of drawing the edge from prey to predator . in this work we will consider only _ trophic webs _",
    ", where all species which have exactly the same predators and prey are merged .",
    "another characterization can be obtained by considering all the species that have no predators .",
    "they are usually indicated as the _ top _ ( t ) species .",
    "similarly , the species with no prey are called _ basal _ species ( b ) .",
    "all the others form the _ intermediate _",
    "( i ) class .",
    "all the species are ultimately sustained by the transformation into biomass of external resources like water , mineral sunlight by means of the basal species .",
    "it is then customary to describe this situation with the introduction of an external node , called zero node , which points to all basal species i.e. to that nodes with only out - edges . given this structure , it is easy to define layers of species given by the distance ( i.e. the minimum path ) towards the zero node of external resources .",
    "the distance is measured as the number of edges the biomass has to travel . as in the internet@xcite",
    "some loops can be present in the system and they account for the stability and resilience of these structures@xcite .",
    "food webs have been modelled in many ways , and the different models have been validated with the experimental data available . here",
    "we focus on one recent and successful model on which we create a suitable population dynamics by means of lotka - volterra equations whose parameters are self - determined by the topology created by the model itself .",
    "there are many static models of food webs which reproduce the features of real ecosystems such as fractions of top , basal and intermediate species , number of food chains , average chain length , and connectance @xcite .",
    "the simplest way is to create suitable graphs @xcite , where ( given the linkage density and the number of nodes ) , directed edges are assigned to randomly chosen pairs of nodes .",
    "the agreement between real and simulated food webs is not very good .",
    "this is not surprising , since this simple model has many unrealistic features such as the assumption that every species can in principle be the predator of every other species .",
    "recently william and martinez introduced another static model , called  niche model \" @xcite .",
    "the authors found a remarkable agreement between real webs and the synthetic ones generated by the model ( much better than the one measured for cascade model @xcite ) .",
    "this is particularly true when considering features such as cycles and species similarities .",
    "the external parameters of the model ( i.e. the quantities fixed from the beginning ) are the number of species @xmath5 and the directed connectance @xmath6 . to every node",
    "is assigned a uniformly distributed number @xmath7 into the interval @xmath8 $ ] , the niche space .",
    "a species @xmath9 is characterized by its niche parameter and its list of prey .",
    "prey are chosen for all species according to the following rule : a species @xmath9 preys on all species @xmath10 with niche parameters @xmath11 inside a segment of length @xmath12 centered in a position chosen randomly inside the interval @xmath13 $ ] , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 a random variable with probability density function @xmath16 choosing @xmath17 is possible to generate graphs with the desired size and connectance .",
    "niche model estimates the central tendency of empirical data remarkably well @xcite .",
    "its topological and analytical properties have been widely studied @xcite and it has been shown that the predictions of the model are robust with respect to the specific form of the @xmath18 chosen@xcite .",
    "given the network structure , we want to define a population dynamics for the individuals of the species described in this food web .",
    "to each node @xmath9 we associate a population i.e. a function of time @xmath19 which represents the density of individuals of the same trophic species per unit of area .",
    "to describe population dynamics we use the generalized lotka - volterra equations : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the intrinsic growth rate of species @xmath9 , @xmath22 his carrying capacity and @xmath23 represents the effect species @xmath10 has on the population of species @xmath9 . pulling the carrying capacity into the interaction term the equations became @xmath24 this does nt actually change the equations , but only how the interaction @xmath25 is defined . for simplicity",
    "all self - interacting terms @xmath26 are set to 1 .",
    "one can represent both the populations and the growth rates as rows of numbers ( vectors ) and the interaction term @xmath27 as a matrix , called also _",
    "competition kernel_. let us suppose that we have only one type of external resource @xmath28 produced with a constant rate @xmath29 ( _ renewability _ of resources ) and let us also suppose that each basal species consumes a fraction @xmath30 at a rate @xmath31 .",
    "the equation for the resources is : @xmath32 where the first term considers the renewability and the second one gives the total rate of consume only for basal species . ] .",
    "if we consider the equilibrium conditions for equations that is [ lveq ] and [ res ] , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , we find a relationship between the ecological parameters given by @xmath35 this gives a fundamental constraint on all the parameters ( except the @xmath12 ) , especially on the competition kernel which must be invertible .",
    "some authors use as competition kernel a function of the distances between species in niche space @xcite .",
    "the problem with such a choice is that the topology of the food web is not included in the equations ; a simple way to incorporate it is to use a combination of projections weights , an issue treated in the next section .",
    "an adjacency matrix @xmath36 of @xmath5 rows and columns represents an aggregated food web with @xmath5 trophic species .",
    "the elements @xmath37 is taken @xmath38 if species @xmath10 predates on species @xmath9 and @xmath39 otherwise .",
    "the ecosystem can also be represented as a bipartite graph @xcite where two classes of nodes are present : predators ( top and intermediate species ) and prey ( basal and intermediate species ) and each directed edge is always disposed between nodes belonging to different classes .",
    "such a graph can be projected into the predators - network , where two predators are connected with an edge weighted proportionally to the numbers of prey they have in common and , correspondingly , into the prey - network , where two prey are connected according to the number of predators they share .",
    "the projection graphs are two undirected , weighted graphs whose sizes are the number of predators and the number of prey in the food web respectively .",
    "the corresponding adjacency matrices @xmath40 and @xmath41 are symmetric and we define their elements in the following way : @xmath42 we choose to normalize the predators weights over all possible prey , and the prey weights over all possible predators . note that @xmath43 and @xmath44 . since the change in the size of the graphs ( without loss of generality ) we relabel the vertices in the two graphs and keep the information about the species they represent @xcite .",
    "the weights of the projections graphs are a measure of the interspecific competition for resources , giving information on how two species compete ( or are object of competition ) in the predation interaction .",
    "a more significant meaning of this quantity should be derived by the analysis of an original weighted food web where the strength of the predation is also considered .",
    "for this reason , considering equation [ lveq ] we propose the following competition kernel that joins in a self - organized way@xcite the topology with the dynamics : @xmath45 this means that the influence of population @xmath9 on population @xmath10 is negative if species @xmath9 and @xmath10 share some prey and positive if they share some predators .",
    "the competition between two species increases with respect to the number of prey species they share and vice versa . using the elements defined in eq .",
    "[ projkernel ] , it is possible to simulate a population dynamics on both model and empirical food webs .",
    "the stability of empirical and model food webs has been tested numerically following this steps :    1 .   _ food web adjacency matrix_. we generate it using niche model , where the input parameters are connectance @xmath46 and size @xmath5 . in real cases",
    "this is done considering empirical food webs data .",
    "competition kernel_. we derive the competition kernel @xmath47 from equation [ projkernel ] .",
    "ecological parameters_. we fix the parameters @xmath12 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 : * as a first approximation the intrinsic growths @xmath12 are set all equals for all species .",
    "this means that in the ideal condition of no competition and infinite resources , all the populations should grow at the same rate .",
    "varying these parameters one can simulate the different lifetimes of species and their reproduction strategies . * setting the carrying capacities @xmath49 of the species means that , in the ideal condition of no interspecific competition ( @xmath50 ) , the maximum number of individuals per unit of space which are sustainable from the external environment is fixed for every species . * the consuming rates @xmath48 has been set to 0.1 only for basal species .",
    "this is quite realistic because basal species are , by definition , the species which directly feed on the external environment .",
    "* at this point using equation [ constraint ] we fix the renewability of resources @xmath29 which depends basicly on the topology of the graph .",
    "to avoid indefinite growth , for simulated food webs , we fix the maximum renewability @xmath51 and generate graphs with the same connectance and size until we obtain the desired renewability ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "integration of equations_. once we have the competition kernel and the desired @xmath29 we solve the equations [ lveq ] using the 4th order runge - kutta algorithm 5 .",
    "_ stability_. the results have been collected in the steady state .",
    "we measured topological properties of projections graphs for both empirical and model food webs .",
    "the data we used have been selected to be the largest and highest - quality empirical trophic food webs present in literature .",
    "they represent a wide range of ecosystems , from freshwater habitat ( skipwith pond swp , little rock lake lrl , bridge brooke lake bbl ) to freshwater - marine interface ( chesapeake bay cpb , ythan estuary ye ) to terrestrial habitats ( coachella valley cde , saint martin island smi )    the measure of all topological features ( except for averaged weights ) is made by considering the binary matrices of projections where all weights different from 0 are put to 1 .",
    "looking at the empirical graphs we find a very symmetric topology ( fig.[skipwithpred ] , [ skipwithprey ] ) .",
    "some projections show the formation of isolated communities both in predators and in prey graphs ( fig .",
    "[ chesapeakepred ] , [ chesapeakeprey ] ) and sometimes we find only isolated nodes i.e. specialists in predation or in being a prey .",
    "this possibility of community formation is not considered in directed food webs .",
    "in fact , in both empirical and model graphs , there are no isolated nodes or clusters ( in niche model isolated species are removed ) .",
    "we can measure this feature by considering the matrices of path lengths whose elements are given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a path connecting node @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "putting @xmath55 when the distance between @xmath9 and @xmath10 is infinite i.e. when the nodes are in different clusters .",
    "we compute average path length using two different normalizations : @xmath56-(l_0/2)}\\sum_{i > j}d_{ij } \\label{averagelgt}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the number of zeros in the matrix of path lengths . with this definitions",
    "@xmath58 is the average path length over all possible paths and @xmath59 is the average path length over all real paths .",
    "we have @xmath60 being 0 when all nodes are isolated and 1 when all nodes are in the same cluster .",
    "together with this we measure other topological quantities such as clustering , diameter and average weight , for both projections ( table [ tableproj ] ) .",
    "one of the first evidences is that the formation of communities is always common to both projections .",
    "connectance varies from @xmath61 of cde to @xmath62 of swp , indicating that projections graphs are strongly connected in comparison to the original food webs .",
    "average weights , the only quantities measured considering projections as weighted graphs , vary from @xmath63 to @xmath64 for predators and from @xmath65 to @xmath66 for prey .",
    "it seems that @xmath67 is independent from original connectance and takes high values compared to model projections .",
    "furthermore we can say that projections of food webs present all the characteristics of small world networks i.e. small diameter and large clustering @xcite .",
    "we then compute the same quantities for projections of graphs derived from niche model and random graphs in function of the mean degree of original directed graphs ( fig .",
    "[ 4graph ] ) .",
    "we expect averaged topological properties of random projections to be the same for predators and prey s graphs because in and out degree distributions of random digraphs have the same form @xcite . comparing the curves with empirical data we find good agreement for clustering and average path lengths .",
    "the model represents the formation of competitive communities better than random projections while it overestimates diameters and underestimates average weights .",
    "we see how empirical @xmath68 is better described through random projections , and how @xmath67 of empirical projections is larger than model and random averaged weights .",
    "we can explain this trend considering the feeding rule of niche model which assigns prey from a single portion of niche space .",
    "this reduces the probability of sharing different resources to a single , well distributed interval , augmenting the diameter and reducing weights of projections graphs . on the other side ,",
    "empirical food webs are not strictly interval and do exhibit a strong bias towards contiguity of prey @xcite .",
    "this result suggest that empirical observed niches , once mapped onto a single dimension , should be composed of various intervals along niche space .",
    "we tested the stability of these lotka - volterra systems using both empirical and model food webs .",
    "we remarked that , among all possible behaviors , using coefficients [ projkernel ] as competition kernel , the system reaches quite always the steady state for small @xmath5 and @xmath46 .",
    "otherwise the system is no longer stable and populations sizes go to infinity when complexity , measured as @xmath69 , grows .",
    "we tested steady states changing initial conditions , and ecological parameters .",
    "the only stable empirical food web is chesapeake bay ( cpb ) which is the one with the lowest complexity . in fig [ dyn1 ]",
    "we present population dynamics obtained setting initial population s densities to 1 for all species and changing the intrinsic growth of the species .",
    "we remarked that the @xmath12 are a measure of the speed of convergence of populations sizes . augmenting the intrinsic growths the steady state",
    "is reached faster .",
    "populations sizes at the steady state should be equal to the carrying capacities , but the presence of competition kernel changes the real @xmath49 of every species .",
    "we remarked , however , that this parameters give the size s order of stable populations and when @xmath70 mean population is always @xmath71 .",
    "we obtain the same result changing the initial conditions .    to conclude our analysis we simulated population dynamics on niche model .",
    "we fixed s and c and generated 100 realizations of population dynamics on model graphs for a relevant number of points .",
    "we counted how many times the system reaches the steady state and how many times it diverges .",
    "again we find that , using expression [ projkernel ] as competition kernel , these are the only two observed behaviors . the probability of reaching a steady state decreases with complexity ( fig .",
    "[ stable1 ] and [ stable2 ] ) .",
    "population dynamics on graphs from niche model is stable only for small s and c which is no longer true for empirical food webs .",
    "simulating dynamics on graphs with more than 50 nodes is a hard computational task .",
    "however it is evident that the model is stable for @xmath72 and that stability decreases linearly between @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "this results are robust under the change of initial conditions and ecological parameters .    with this",
    "we show that it is possible to avoid chaotic behaviors of lotka - volterra systems using weights of projections graphs as competition kernel .",
    "when a fixed food web topology gives raise to stable populations , its complexity must be small .",
    "this confirms recent findings of theoretical ecology that complex food webs are not necessarily stable .",
