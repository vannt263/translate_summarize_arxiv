    "the original geometric discretisation scheme captured topological data . for the simplical complex , it was developed by several authors @xcite . here",
    "we will consider the hyper - cubic version of it @xcite as our starting point .",
    "an alternative derivation of the whitney elements is introduced which suits our purpose .",
    "first , we point out the important shortcomings of the original geometric discretisation method :    * the discrete wedge was non - associative . *",
    "operators are only exact as operations on the discrete chains , ( i.e there is no direct correspondence or `` functor '' between the discrete operations and the continuum ones ) .",
    "* whitney elements play a spectator role and so the theory is topological only .",
    "recently , samik sen @xcite has shown that by replacing a simplicial complex by a hyper - cubic complex , two new features emerge compared to the original proposal : the hodge star operator satisfy @xmath18 and second , the associated dual complex being hyper - cubic as well , it can be provided with explicit expressions for the whitney elements .",
    "the second item of the list above is crucial to us , because we are going to take the whitney forms as the basic building blocks of the theory .",
    "then , we use the product space of chains to generate the appropriate collection of forms which will in turn allow us to consider a discretised system with symplectic geometric data .    in contrast",
    ", the original scheme does not utilize the whitney forms beyond providing a space that gives rise to the de rham co - homology complex , so we need not know the explicit form of the whitney elements to proceed topologically . here , we put the whitney elements and the various combinatorial manipulations of them at the forefront of the formulation . here , a discrete operation is _ exact _ _ _ if when mapped to the continuum its algebraic properties hold exactly .",
    "then in turn , by accommodating the other operations in the theory ( @xmath19 ) we can show that the combinatorics of whitney elements that we introduce is such that the topological data is still captured .",
    "we find that :    * the basis of whitney forms encodes the topology and is very constraining that way , but allows for the product space of chains . *",
    "secondly , the problem of the non - associativity of the wedge is by - passed by not relying on the wedge but on a new product in order to define the contraction .    these arguments both",
    "provide a strong motivation for considering the product space of chains .",
    "before we turn to that , we review the geometric discretisation scheme .      the general program of the topological discretisation is described at length in @xcite , on a manifold , we have fields @xmath20 which are differential forms ( antisymmetric tensor fields ) , and the various operations of interest are : to consider a theory defined on an arbitrary manifold m of dimension d. suppose the theory has fields @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the theory is constructed using the following objects which are defined on the manifold m : p - forms @xmath24 which are generalized antisymmetric tensor fields , the exterior derivative @xmath25 , the hodge star operator @xmath26 , which is required to define scalar products , and the wedge operator @xmath27 . on a manifold m of dimension",

    "the following definitions are also important :    * the laplacian on p - forms @xmath38 . * the inner product @xmath39 .",
    "we would like to discretise the fields of @xmath24 , the inner product @xmath40 and the operators @xmath28 such that discrete analogies of the above interrelationships hold . to do this",
    "it is necessary to first introduce a few standard ideas .",
    "we first discretise the manifold m by replacing m by a collection of discrete objects , known as simplices , glued together @xcite . for @xmath41 , a @xmath1-simplex @xmath42",

    "geometrically the _ barycenter _ of a given n - simplex @xmath50 is defined by @xmath51    thus the barycenter of @xmath52 $ ] is the midpoint between the vertices @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we can now describe a particular way that a given manifold @xmath0 can be discretised .",
    "let @xmath55 be a collection of simplices @xmath56 , @xmath57 , with the property that the faces of the simplices which belong to @xmath55 also belong to it . the elements of @xmath55 glued together in the following way is known as a simplicial complex@xcite , @xcite :    1 .",
    "@xmath58 if @xmath59 , @xmath60 have no common face .",
    "2 .   @xmath61 if @xmath59 , @xmath60 have precisely one face in common , along which they are glued together .    in many cases of interest(including all differentiable manifolds @xcite ) ,",

    "@xmath62 is then said to be a triangulation of @xmath0(note this triangulation is not unique ) . in this way of discretising m ,",
    "the building blocks are zero , one , @xmath63 , d - dimensional objects , all of which are simplices e.g.generalized oriented tetrahedra .",
    "the same manifold can be discretised using hyper - cubes or a cw complex .",
    "we will adopt the hyper - cubic approach which is the neater one , for the following reason which has to do with the construction of the complex dual @xmath64 . first note that in contrast with fig.1 , the analogue construction for the dual complex in the case of the hyper - cubic complex leads to two superimposed complexes shifted by a half edges length , and in turn the whitney elements are readily available @xcite .",
    "let us first recall the construction of the discrete hodge star for the simplicial complex which leads to @xmath64 . in the way analogue to the continuum property ( 3 .",
    "above ) , a map from a @xmath9 dimensional object to a @xmath1 dimensional object was introduced .",

    "@xmath9 dimensional objects of the form @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is a face of @xmath67 . the orientation of these are set so as to be compatible with the manifold .",
    "joining these objects together gives us the dual of @xmath13 .    .",
    "]    we can now give the general rule for mapping an n - simplex @xmath68 $ ] to a ( @xmath69 dimensional object ( ( d - n ) cell ) as follows : we think of @xmath66 as an element of a simplicial complex k. we have @xmath70\\to\\cup[\\hat{\\sigma_n } , \\hat{\\sigma_{n+1}},\\dots,\\hat{\\sigma_d}],\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the barycenter of an ( @xmath72)-simplex which has @xmath66 as a face .",
    "@xmath73 is the barycenter of an ( @xmath74)-simplex which has @xmath67 as a face and so on .",
    "these objects have to be coherently oriented with respect to @xmath75 $ ] .",
    "the set of these cells constitutes the dual space @xmath76 of k. by this procedure , a discrete version of the hodge star operation was constructed .",
    "let us explain .",
    "the hodge star operator involves forms .",
    "it maps @xmath1-forms in d dimensions to a ( @xmath77)-form .",
    "the @xmath78 map involves not forms but geometrical objects .",
    "there is a simple correspondence relation between these two cases . given a @xmath1-form , @xmath79 , and a p - dimensional geometrical space , @xmath80 , the @xmath1-form can be integrated over @xmath80 to give a number .",
    "thus @xmath80 and @xmath79 are objects that can be paired .",
    "we can write this as a pairing @xmath81 in order to proceed , we need to introduce some more structure . we start by associating with a simplicial complex @xmath62 , containing @xmath82 @xmath83 a vector space consisting of finite linear combinations over the reals of the @xmath1-simplices it contains .",
    "this vector space is known as the space of p - chains,@xmath84 . for two elements @xmath85",
    ", a scalar product @xmath86 can be introduced .",
    "an oriented p - simplex changes sign under a change of orientation i.e. if @xmath87 $ ] and @xmath88 is a permutation of the indices @xmath89 $ ] , then @xmath90= ( -1)^\\tau[v_0,\\dots , v_p]$ ] , with @xmath88 denoting the number of transpositions needed to bring @xmath90 $ ] to the order @xmath91 $ ] .    given the vector space @xmath84 , the boundary operator @xmath92 can be defined as @xmath93 it is the linear operator which maps an oriented p simplex @xmath42 to the sum of its ( p-1 ) faces with orientation induced by the orientation of @xmath94 . if @xmath95 $ ] , then @xmath96,\\ ] ] where @xmath97 $ ] means that the vertex @xmath98 has been omitted from @xmath94 to produce the face `` opposite '' to it .",

    "we can use the scalar product to identify @xmath101 , so that we can consider oriented @xmath1-simplices as elements of @xmath99 as well as @xmath84 .",

    "the boundary operators @xmath109 and the coboundary operator @xmath103 have the property @xmath110 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath111 these operators are the discrete analogies of the operators @xmath3 and @xmath112 which act on forms .",
    "these operators could be defined only when a scalar product(``metric '' ) was introduced in the vector space @xmath113 s . at this stage",
    "we have a discrete geometrical analogue of @xmath3 , @xmath37 and @xmath8 .",
    "we have also commented on the fact that the operation @xmath8 maps simplices into dual cells i.e. not simplices .",
    "if the original simplicial system is described in terms of the union of the vector spaces of all p - chains then the space into which elements of the vector space are mapped by @xmath8 is not contained within this space , unlike the situation for the hodge star operation on forms .",
    "it is found that this leads inevitably to a doubling of the fields when discretisation , preserving topological structures , is attempted .",
    "we now need a way to relate a @xmath1-chain to a @xmath1-form .",
    "this together with a construction which linearly maps p - forms to p - simplices allows us to translate expressions in the continuum to a corresponding discrete geometrical objects .",
    "we start with the construction of the linear maps from p - chains to @xmath1-forms due to whitney @xcite . in order to define this map ,",

    "one can think of @xmath120 as the position of the center of mass of a collection of masses @xmath115 located on the vertices @xmath121 respectively .",
    "setting @xmath119 for instance means the center of mass will be in the face opposite the vertex @xmath98 .",
    "the whitney map can now be defined .",

    "we next construct the linear map from @xmath1-forms to @xmath1-chains .",
    "this is known as the de rham map .",
    "we have @xmath128 defined by @xmath129 for each oriented @xmath1-simplex @xmath130 .    a discrete version of the wedge product",

    "we now show how @xmath140 can be considered as discrete analogue of @xmath141 . for this",
    "we need barycentric subdivision .    in order to construct the star map ,",
    "two geometrically distinct spaces were introduced . the original simplicial decomposition @xmath62 with its associated set of p - chains @xmath99 and the dual cell decomposition @xmath64 with its associated set of p - chains @xmath142 .",
    "these spaces are distinct .",
    "however both belong to the first barycentric subdivision of @xmath62 .",
    "this allows the use the @xmath140 operation if we think of @xmath62 and @xmath64 as elements of @xmath143 .",
    "we proceed as follows .",

    "the main features of the new scheme are introduced in relation with the definition of a contraction operation ; in section iv , we proceed with the lie derivative , the lie algebra and associated group action on the space of whitney forms . in the last part",
    "we discuss the convergence and a numerical implementation . in the appendix we outline in",
    "what sense the theory still captures topology , and display some calculations .",
    "the subsequent article will tackle the metric along with the covariant derivative and the curvature .",
    "a special role will be given to the dual complex @xmath64 in relation with the metric connection .",
    "we will also propose some applications to physics .",
    "in what follows , we will consider a hyper - cubic complex , since it is the most used in the literature , and we have already pointed out its advantages .",

    "that the @xmath3 operation is correct , is by verifying that the stokes theorem holds .",
    "however , by using the formulae of whitney directly given the cubic barycenter coordinates one finds that the requirement @xmath161 is not satisfied which then makes the basis list of forms an incorrect basis of whitney elements as noted by samik sen @xcite .    to remedy this problem",
    "we derive the whitney map by induction .",

    "we will sketch the proof by induction , a detailed one will be given elsewhere .",
    "the first observation is that for zero co - chains , adopting the functional form of the example of the square above , we find that any vertex @xmath166 $ ] has within a given top dimensional simplex @xmath167 of which it is a face the following expression : @xmath168 ) = \\pi_k f_k\\ ] ] where each factor is either @xmath169 the factors enforce the boundary conditions , and depend on which bounding simplex we are taking for the evaluation of the whitney map .",
    "the claim is then that we can extract the remaining elements , i.e of higher degrees .",
    "an immediate observation is that application of @xmath3 will suppress factors @xmath170 and replace them up to sign by a form @xmath171 .",
    "moreover , the factor @xmath170 that is suppressed relaxes one of the boundary conditions relating to the simplex containing both the original one and its extension caused by application of @xmath139 . in turn",
    ", this leads to a well - defined pull - back map for integration over a given simplex @xmath172 which we denote by @xmath173 and the space of whitney elements is generated by the image ( denoted @xmath174 ) of @xmath175 under the pull - back for each and every @xmath176-simplex in @xmath177 , @xmath178 this map , gives us the whitney elements .",
    "take a @xmath179 , then assume @xmath180 is given . then by application of the pull - back map after evaluating @xmath181 using gives @xmath164 for a @xmath182-simplex .",
    "this process is done until the list of @xmath182-simplices is exhausted .",

    "a side issue is that of completeness .",

    "the whitney elements obtained are the correct ones ( see the appendix ) .    to visualize the whitney elements , we sketch below what a 1-co - chain looks like . as is apparent from the formulae , a one - chain with non - zero coefficients along the edges parallel to the @xmath190-axis have the following shape , you see that the form jumps over cells which are parallel to the 1-chain but this does not affect the differentiability of the form since @xmath191 on a @xmath192-form . and in multiple dimensions you get all derivatives apart from @xmath193 .",
    "[ fig : t ]     and a whitney form with function coefficient sketched in the @xmath186-axis . ]    at this point we take the topological theory above and modify it in order to consider geometry .",
    "the key construction that leads us to geometry is the formulae given below for a hyper - cubic interior product and the numerous properties it possesses as we proceed to describe .",

    "geometrical information in the sense of introducing a metric in this frame corresponds to following the vielbein formalism and is related to the regge approach .",

    "the metric is the locally flat metric mentioned in section i.    we now begin our construction by noting that the discretisation scheme is too restrictive in order to consider a geometry .",
    "what we need is a contraction map @xmath194 in order to consider vector fields and geometry . with @xmath3 and @xmath194",
    "we will construct the lie derivative @xmath195 ( and in turn , in the subsequent article , with some prescription for the metric and the lie derivative we will be able to construct a covariant derivative @xmath196 ) .",
    "the problem we start with is to construct a hyper - cubic analogue of the interior product ( or contraction ) map : @xmath197 our strategy is to apply the de rham map to the dual one form of the vector field @xmath107 represented as a one - chain ( i.e a linear combination of edges ) and to the degree @xmath198-form that results from @xmath199 after contraction . thus providing us with a pair of chains .",
    "let us extract it from the continuum by rewriting as @xmath200 and then notice that this expression , as a pairing of two forms , can be represented on the chain space of the @xmath62 complex as : @xmath201 where @xmath202 is a one - chain , @xmath203 is an @xmath176-chain and @xmath204 an @xmath198 chain which results from contracting @xmath203 .",
    "it is similar to what we have in the continuum with exception that @xmath202 , a one - chain plays the role of a coefficient function and so should be treated as such .",
    "second remark is that we will see that in fact this leads to a well - defined operation on the complex and is exact when the form @xmath199 and the dual to the vector field @xmath107 are in fact whitney elements .",
    "also , we introduced a generalized product on the space of chains , denoted by @xmath205 the choice of the symbol is made to stress that it comes from the contraction operation .",
    "it clearly distinguishes between the chain on its right and that on its left .",
    "let us postpone the formal construction and consider examples",

    "this generalizes obviously to higher degree chains : we get a linear combination of the @xmath198-simplices which are orthogonal to the vector field ( an edge ) .",
    "the second calculation is there because it shows that although @xmath207 $ ] is not a face of @xmath213 $ ] , the contraction still applies because they are parallel within the same cell of highest degree which plays the role of the local open set .",
    "we formalize a little the interior product we have constructed and in the next sections , we will have to modify the other operators accordingly , notably @xmath139 the co - boundary .",
    "the discretised interior product is a map from the product space of chains to the product space of chains , in the way that @xmath217 is a pairing of a one - chain and an @xmath176-chain which is mapped to a priori an @xmath218-chain but is a bit more general and the vector field is explicit : @xmath219 where @xmath220 is the @xmath198-chain that results from the contraction by taking a linear combination of faces of @xmath221 .",
    "there is also a sense in which the contraction is done in a `` local '' open set which is determined by the cell ( or simplex ) of highest dimension which contains both @xmath107 and @xmath203 .",
    "+ also , the whitney map applied to @xmath222 treats the vector field as a function coefficient i.e : @xmath223 where @xmath224 deletes the constant form part of the whitney element , @xmath225 the generalization of this operation when more than one contraction has been applied to a chain , like for the jacobi identities below , is done in the obvious way .    having shown that the operation works in the cell , we return briefly to the consideration of chains",
    ", we alluded to them in the discussion of fig .",
    "there is a pairing of chains in @xmath217 which makes the map bilinear .",
    "it is clear that each simplex gives rise to a co - chain with support over all cells that have that simplex as a face .",
    "this is related to the notion of calculating in the `` local '' open set we alluded to .",
    "otherwise , we are left with the consideration of constant vector fields , we will return to that in the discussion of the lie derivative .",
    "we write the bi - linearity of the interior product as @xmath226 in words , given a one simplex @xmath98 from the one - chain @xmath107 , and one term @xmath227 from the chain @xmath203 , if they are both faces of a higher dimensional hyper - cube @xmath228 , then the terms contributes .",
    "it is then straightforward to establish that the discrete interior product squared is zero .",
    "having introduced the interior product , we allow for geometry , but in doing so , the closure of the operations is on the product space of chains .",
    "we will establish that the other operations @xmath5 , @xmath3 and @xmath8 can be modified in a way that makes the theory consistent topologically .",
    "also , we will see that the jacobi identities work exactly thus limiting the result of the chain operation to the product of two such spaces , while the intermediary steps involve three .",
    "so let us modify the discrete theory to accommodate the new operator @xmath194 .      a priori it is already under control , since if @xmath199 is a whitney form , we know how to calculate @xmath229 , it is a linear combination of @xmath182-degree whitney elements using the co - boundary @xmath230 on the complex .",
    "however @xmath231 is problematic , we need to make a prescription for it since it is an object in the product space of chains .",
    "the outcome is that we can define it in a consistent way which also leaves the cohomology intact . to see this ,",
    "go back to the 2d example and let @xmath232 } [ 0123 ] ) = d^k ( [ 01 ] \\rfloor^k ( [ 0 ] + [ 1 ] ) ) = 2[01 ] \\rfloor^k ( [ 30 ] + [ 21])\\ ] ] while mapping both sides to the continuum we get the correct result which is @xmath233 the operation is well - defined in general , when applying @xmath3 after @xmath194 , we only take partial derivatives with respect to the orthogonal directions to both @xmath234 and @xmath221 and @xmath235 .",
    "so we can apply the leibniz rule for functions in a combinatorial way by writing @xmath236 where @xmath139 is the original co - boundary map , and thus , the homology of the theory in the product space is the same as that of the original theory and leads to the desirable result : @xmath237 to justify the formulae , we can give a proof , by taking the general whitney form in a hyper - cube which was discussed above .",
    "so let @xmath238 then , starting with the right hand side of , we get @xmath239 the point is that when you move the derivatives @xmath240 across to the left , you pick up all the terms since the vector has at least every @xmath170 factor that @xmath203 has . there is a minor sign issue which as to be watched out for , since as stated above , we allow to contract with edges that are parallel to @xmath203 and @xmath241 .",
    "return to the co - homology .",
    "the @xmath242-property can be used twice to show that @xmath243 since @xmath244 on the space of chains .",
    "we had the property that @xmath245 and we have deduced that @xmath246 the @xmath242-property is particularly convenient since it also helps to consider exact chains as well as closed chains .",
    "let us consider an @xmath182-chain which is exact , @xmath247 then , considering a one - chain representing the vector field @xmath107 and assume that we contracted an @xmath182-chain that gave @xmath248 . then , immediately we get @xmath249 which is a rewriting of leading to the homology groups @xmath250 the picture is the following : we had the link between the de rham co - homology and the homology as a basis for discretising differential forms with the operator @xmath3 .",
    "now , we have extended the theory to the product space of chains in a way that preserves the content of the topological theory , and furthermore gives us access to the geometry .",
    "whitney elements have a central role in the theory .",
    "the product is much the same , but it is worth pointing out how it co - exists with @xmath194 since we have to check that it acts as an anti - derivation on the space of chains i.e @xmath251 again the criterion is given by the continuum analogue which is @xmath252 but we have already proved that because the interior product is exact on the space of whitney forms .",
    "so by using @xmath253 we rely on the continuum identity and so .",
    "as is known , the wedge gives rise to the cohomology ring , and that the discrete wedge ( or cup product ) is non - associative , or it is only up to a factor . by acting with @xmath3 on @xmath254 , we invoke the liebnitz rule which is exact only after integration ( application of the de rham map ) in the original geometric discretisation .",
    "the point is that whitney forms were only present as dummy integration variables which are compatible with @xmath3 , while here we want exactness before integrating thus preserving the topological properties associated to @xmath3 and to @xmath194 .",
    "then , to take the wedge product of two `` contracted '' chains is done in the natural way ( where @xmath255 is the tensor product ) @xmath256 again in a similar fashion as for @xmath3 you see that we are combining the homology groups in the same way as on the chain space : @xmath257 as can be seen by noting that the term under brackets is the ordinary wedge operation in the chain space . + the hodge star has two representatives in the discrete theory , one in the @xmath62 subdivision and one in the @xmath64 subdivision .",
    "we write : @xmath258 then , the associated properties of @xmath259 and @xmath260 hold , since using , we get @xmath261 where we used the fact that @xmath262 and in much the same way as for the sedge , we still have the poincar duality @xmath263 what is important at this point is that the operations @xmath264 are essentially topological and the function coefficient is passive or gives rise to a factor of two which does not modify the homology , a discussion of the co - homology of the theory in the product space is given in the appendix .",
    "let us turn to the lie derivative .",
    "with the operations @xmath3 and @xmath194 in place , it is a matter of consistency that the discrete lie derivative , as given by the cartan formulae @xmath265 should have the following analogue : @xmath266 we will find that we can go quite a long way with it and consider a discrete version of the lie group . as we saw , we consider the vector field as being represented by a one - cochain which is its dual differential form .",
    "the theory is seen as a theory of differential forms and so this choice is imposed to us . if we were to consider the vector fields in the dual complex as @xmath267 in the @xmath64 , we would loose the common support that both the vector field an the form must have in order to carry through the construction of the exterior calculus .",
    "we start with examples , since we already have the operators .    : ( see the appendix ) , to investigate the construction , we start with the vector field ( dual to ) and the form .",
    "these are the continuum analogies of , .",
    "the vector and the form will be considered on three faces , @xmath268 $ ] , @xmath269 $ ] and @xmath270 $ ] for this purpose .",
    "to each of those corresponds a volume element two - form , as given in section ii ( i.e a constant form such as @xmath271 ) .",
    "note that due to the orthogonality of the form with the vector chosen , we get @xmath272 .",
    "next , evaluation of @xmath273 in the discrete setting is obtained by means of applying the rules for the hyper - cubic complex given in section ii .",
    "after application of the whitney map the result ( e.g ) is obtained by application of the rule : + this means that the transcription into an ordinary differential form is obtained by suppressing the form part ( like a @xmath274 or a @xmath275 ) on the left hand side of the @xmath205 symbol .",
    "so by substituting the list of whitney elements given in appendix b , and the rule , we obtain which leads to the identification of the various terms in .",
    "we have found the following : @xmath276    we now move to a more delicate case , for which we will need to clarify the notion of the tangent space @xmath277 of vector fields , where @xmath278 may be taken as an open set taken to be the cell .",
    "we wish to point out that we do not think of the tangent space @xmath279 as a fiber bundle .",
    "the topology of the complex is too restrictive for that , open sets only overlap on a common boundary . however , the whitney elements , because their support overlaps over boundaries guarantee as we will see , that we can consider properties of vector fields .",
    "+ : take the vector @xmath280 to be parallel and in fact identical to @xmath281 . in this case",
    ", one has to be careful since if we use the proposed formulae for the interior product , we get , which is clearly wrong since there should be some terms with coefficient @xmath282 as shown in the appendix .",
    "this is the point at which we introduce the rule above from which we get .",
    "considering , keeping only the terms in @xmath283 $ ] , @xmath284\\rfloor^k ( [ 0 ] + [ 6 ] ) + ( v_{z_1}^{2}- v_{z_1 } v_{z_2 } ) [ 17 ] \\rfloor^k([1 ] + [ 7]),\\ ] ] then , @xmath285 \\rfloor^k ( [ 10 ] + [ 76])+2(v_{z_1}^2 - v_{z_1}v_{z_2 } ) [ 17 ] \\rfloor^k ( [ 01 ] + [ 67 ] ) \\\\ & = 2 ( - ( v_{z_2}^2 - v_{z_1 } v_{z_2 } ) ( 1-x ) + ( v_{z_1}^2 - v_{z_1 } v_{z_2 } ) x ) dx \\\\ & = 2 ( v_{z_1 } - v_{z_2 } ) ( v_{z_2 } ( 1-x ) + v_{z_1 } x ) dx \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as required to match the continuum expression .",
    "for the @xmath286-term , the problem of support which lead us to modify the coefficients does not arise and we get @xmath287 - v_{z_1}v_{z_2}[17 ] + v_{z_1}^{2}[17 ] + v_{z_1}v_{z_2}[06 ] ) \\rfloor^k ( [ 01 ] + [ 67 ] ) \\\\ & = ( -v_{z_2}^{2}(1-x ) - v_{z_1}v_{z_2 } x + v_{z_1}^{2}x + v_{z_1}v_{z_2 } ( 1-x )    ) dx \\\\ & = ( v_{z_1 } - v_{z_2 } ) ( v_{z_2 } ( 1-x ) + v_{z_1 } x ) dx \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which gives the correct matching on @xmath283 $ ] , not forgetting the multiplicative factor of two specified by the rule for `` @xmath242 '' .",
    "this gives us the correct matching .",
    "the combination of example 1 and example 2 cover all cases of a pair of a form and a vector field that can be expressed in the present framework ( i.e parallel or orthogonal ) .",

    "we now proceed to analyse the discrete version of the jacobi identities by constructing the complex based version of this calculation .",
    "we will use the rules we have introduced , notably the @xmath309-rule , the rule for immersion and the rule for products of coefficients given below .",

    "this means that we seek a complex based bracket operation that maps to the continuum one by a lie algebra morphism . with the basis of forms we have",
    ", we can already set what the answer is : @xmath314^k = a   ( [ w(x ) , \\ , w(y)])\\ ] ] and this is satisfactory because it is an exact relation and not an approximation as : @xmath315^k = z\\ ] ] the continuum @xmath316 , which means that @xmath186 is a lie algebra morphism .",
    "so this would be enough to establish 2 ) , and certainly proves the existence of the discretised bracket .",
    "what we have is that for a lie algebra @xmath317 in the infinite dimensional representation of vector fields . the map @xmath186 is a lie algebra morphism if and only if , the collection of one form dual to the generators of @xmath317 can be written as a linear combination of whitney elements .",
    "the bracket in is an implicit definition making use of the continuum one .",
    "it is satisfactory as we were able to give an exact analogue of the vector fields @xmath318 .",
    "we proceed to the calculation of the jacobi identities for the lie , and first of all we need the list of edges that are mutually parallel , so that we will know when to apply the rule called `` tangent space of vector fields '' : @xmath319,\\ , [ 06],\\ , [ 35],\\ , [ 24 ] \\ } , \\ ,   l_2 = \\{[67 ] , \\ , [ 54],\\ , [ 32 ] , \\ , [ 01 ] \\ } , \\ , l_3 = \\ { [ 65 ] , \\ , [ 74],\\ , [ 12],\\ , [ 03]\\}.\\ ] ] the detailed calculation is done in appendix c , since all the rules we introduced play a part , we displayed in curly brackets the associated continuum calculation for the purpose of illustration .",

    "however the space of co - chains as being given by the whitney elements does not lead to the correct integral curves and the associated relations , we only obtain an approximation , which is for the flow of a vector field @xmath326 and its discrete counterpart @xmath327 is controlled by correction terms of order @xmath328 . in conclusion to the part on the lie algebra and lie groups , we gather the results .",

    "otherwise it is approximated by the whitney forms .",
    "we now address the central issue of implementing the technique we have just presented and expose some numerical results .",
    "we have seen that the results are exact on the space we have introduced , however the jacobi identity for the lie is only satisfied in the local picture , flows in the group are only approximate in general .",
    "overall , this means that we have good control over the convergence .",
    "an issue related to convergence is that of refining the triangulation ( which is here made of squares ) .",
    "a discussion of this in the context of simplicial categories @xcite is worth considering . in that picture as here , one works with chain complexes @xmath330 and their dual co - chain complexes and it is argued that they are to be preferred to homology . due to the whitehead theorem they are invariant for connected spaces .",
    "that is , we take subdivisions of the original complex and one can relate the associated chain spaces . in turn , given the chain space and the dual cochain space , one can define the various mappings we have introduced above .",
    "[ fig : t ]        in the present perspective , we insist on the fact that refining the triangulation is the only mean by which one can obtain a better approximation to the various forms which we always take to be whitney elements .    next , we discuss the example of a one - form field on the torus , satisfying the equation @xmath331 which is relevant to fluid dynamics @xcite , and is a first step toward setting up the navier - stokes equation in this formalism .",
    "we start by tackling the problem analytically and then numerically .",
    "the square `` triangulation '' of the torus is shown above :    now , the vector field is constant , taken along the @xmath120-axis in the plane of the page @xmath332 .",
    "we seek a one - form solution as a linear combination of whitney elements .",
    "the lie derivative is then : @xmath333 the notation we use for components , is such that it can be applied to every @xmath297d cell .",
    "the sign and @xmath334 or @xmath335 indices denote a specific edge .",

    "similarly when a component outside the cell is needed , we take for example @xmath341 to be the @xmath342 $ ] component .",
    "next is the laplacian term : @xmath343 \\\\ \\label{five } & + ( ( x_+ - x_{+,-i}+ y_{-,j } - y_- ) - ( x_- - x_{-,-i } + y_- - y_{-,-j}))[y- ] \\\\ \\label{seven } & + ( ( x_{+,i}-x_+ + y_{+,j } - y_+ ) - ( x_{-,i}- x_- + y_+ - y_{+ , -j } )        ) [ y+ ] \\\\ & + ( ( x_{- , i}- x_- + y_+ - y_{+,-j})-(x_- - x_{-,-i}+ y_- - y_{-,-j } ) ) [ x- ]   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath344 \\\\ \\label{six } & +   ( ( y_+ - x_+ - y_- + x_-)-(y_- - x_{+,-i } - y_{-,-i } + x_{-,-i } )    ) [ y- ] \\\\ \\label{eight } & + ( ( y_{+,i } - x_{+,i } - y_+ + x_{-,i } ) - ( y_+ - x_+ - y_- + x_- ) ) [ y+ ] \\\\ & + ( ( y_+ - x_+ - y_- + x_+ ) -(y_{+,-j } - x_- - y_{-,-j } + x_{-,-i } ) ) [ x-]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first solution is the constant zero - mode solution .",

    "this required the introduction of a product space .",
    "then , preserving the de rham complex motivated us to consider a ring of operators composed of @xmath194 , @xmath3 and @xmath8 , and the introduction of a special rule for @xmath309 , for which a prescription was required . the lie derivative , as an element of the ring , required us to modify the coefficient of the chain so as to accommodate the case in which the vector field varies over the cell as expressed by the sum of whitney elements .",

    "<S> a definition of a product space of chains allow the notion of contraction to be defined which is essential for introducing analogues of the lie derivative , an operation that describes the way objects change . </S>",
    "<S> the structure constructed gives rise to a consistent discrete exterior calculus , which is to our knowledge a new result . </S>"
