    "techniques for photometric redshift estimation have advanced considerably since the original hubble deep field ( north ) ( hdf - n ) observations ( williams et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "initial techniques for identifying candidate high redshift objects in hdf - n were inspired by the famous ` dropout ' techniques originally developed by steidel et al .",
    "( see paper in these proceedings , and references therein ) .",
    "these have proved highly successful , and have identified several galaxies at z@xmath15 ( eg .",
    "weymann et al . , 1998 , spinrad et al . , 1998 )",
    "since then , more sophisticated approaches to redshift estimation have been developed ( eg .",
    "fernandez - soto et al . , 1998 ) which aim to determine a redshift estimate rather than just select objects likely to have a redshift in some broad range ( eg .",
    "2.5@xmath2z@xmath23.5 for f300w dropouts in one of the hubble deep fields ) .",
    "the advent of the hubble deep field south ( hdf - s ) observations ( williams et al . , 1999 ) , which include not only the optical wfpc-2 observations similar to hdf - n , but also stis uv / optical observations and nicmos near - ir observations , allow us to apply all these techniques to new fields and new wavelengths .",
    "we also benefit from the extensive followup programme on hdf - n for validating and training the various methods .",
    "the present paper describes the application of both traditional ` dropout ' techniques , to select candidate high redshift objects in hdf - s , and a ` template matching ' photometric redshift estimation scheme for determining redshift estimates for all the detected objects .",
    "the simple ` dropout ' technique relies on the passage of the 912  lyman - limit discontinuity through broad - band imaging filters as a function of redshift . at higher redshifts ,",
    "the suppression of light between 1216   and 912   in the emitted frame by the ly@xmath3 forest becomes significant , so that 1216   becomes the breakpoint in the spectra ( spinrad et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "this allows one to select candidate high redshift objects by their colours in broad band filters .",
    "typically , the objects are chosen by their absence in a blue filter , and their relatively flat seds at redder wavelengths .",
    "the classic application of this approach was by steidel et al .",
    "( 1995 ) who used three filters , u , g and r , to select candidate z@xmath03 objects by their absence in the u filter .",
    "similarly , 2.5@xmath2z@xmath23.5 objects were selected in hdf - n by their absence in the f300w filter ( eg .",
    "clements & couch , 1996 ) .",
    "the technique can also be applied to longer wavelength filters for the selection of still higher redshift objects .",
    "for example , the z=5.34 galaxy discussed in spinrad et al .",
    "1998 was discovered as a v - band ( f606w ) dropout in the hdf - n images .",
    "the advent of hdf - s , which has coverage extending to 2.2@xmath4 m in the nicmos field , thus offers the possibility of uncovering galaxies with redshifts @xmath510 if we operate at the longest wavelengths .",
    "much has been learned about high redshift galaxies from experience with hdf - n , so we can tune the selection criteria for hdf - s for greater effectiveness .",
    "consideration of the colour - colour plots in dickinson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) suggests that the following criteria will efficiently select candidate high redshift objects that drop out from a given filter @xmath6 ( all magnitudes referred to are in the ab system ) :    1 .",
    "the colour between filter @xmath6 and the next reddest filter @xmath7 @xmath11.5 2 .",
    "the object should have been detected with at least 10@xmath8 significance in filter @xmath6 if the colour @xmath9 3 .",
    "there is no more than 1 magnitude difference between the flux in any adjacent filters redder than @xmath7    however , at redder wavelengths , there are increasing possibilities for foreground interlopers to turn up in these simple colour selections .",
    "specific problems include the 4000  break in evolved galaxies , and the unusual very red objects . both of these can masquerade as ` dropouts ' especially at high redshift .",
    "additional observations in the near - ir for the wfpc-2 field , or optical for the nicmos field would help to reduce this contamination .",
    "we apply these criteria to catalogs of hdf - s galaxies extracted from the images using sextractor ( bertin & arnouts , 1996 ) .",
    "we uncover 15 candidate z@xmath03 objects ( f300w dropouts ) , 1 z@xmath04 object ( f450w dropout ) , and 16 candidate z@xmath05 ( f606w dropouts ) in the 4.7 sq .",
    "wfpc-2 field .",
    "further examination leads us to believe that 4 of the f300w objects are in fact nearby interlopers , and that there is significant foreground contamination of the f606w dropout list . in the nicmos field we find 4 candidate z@xmath06 ( ` optical ' dropouts  absent from the stis open - band optical image but present at f110w ) one candidate z@xmath08 object ( f110w dropout ) and no candidate z@xmath012 objects ( f160w dropouts ) .",
    "one of the ` optical ' dropouts is the vro suspected to lie at z@xmath11.7 discussed by treu et al .",
    "( 1998 , 1999 ) , and we suspect other vros contaminate the nicmos list .",
    "images for the f300w dropouts are shown in fig .",
    "1 and basic parameters given in table 1 . as can be seen , many of these objects appear to have quite disturbed morphologies , similar to the f300w dropouts discovered in hdf - n .",
    "whether this is a true reflection of the underlying galaxy morphology or a result of these observations lying in the rest - frame far - uv is at this stage unclear . for more information on this work , and for a full catalog of high redshift candidates ,",

    "a more recent approach to multicolour surveys such as hdf - s is to obtain a full photometric redshift solution .",
    "there are a number of approaches to this , as can be seen from many of the other papers in these proceedings .",
    "the approach adopted here , similar to that of fernandez - soto et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , is to match a template spectral energy distribution ( sed ) at a given redshift to the photometric data for a galaxy .",
    "the likelihood that a galaxy is at the assumed redshift can then be calculated :    @xmath12 where f@xmath13 is the observed flux in a given filter , f@xmath14 is the flux predicted for this filter from the template sed given a redshift @xmath15 and a normalisation @xmath16 , and e@xmath13 is the error in the observed flux .",
    "this calculation of likelihood makes the implicit assumption that the flux errors are gaussian .",
    "this likelihood is then maximised to find the most likely redshift for the galaxy given the assumed template and certain astrophysical constraints for the galaxy s properties .",

    "108 such objects appear in the compendium of fernandez - soto et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and are used as a test data set .",
    "the compendium includes infrared fluxes in j , h and k for the objects and these are particularly useful for constraining redshifts .",

    "a number of improvements to the method are still possible , for example we are developing a better treatment for the lyman - forest absorption .",
