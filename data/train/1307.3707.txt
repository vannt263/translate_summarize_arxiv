    "the reactions induced by @xmath11 meson beam are important tools to gain a deeper understanding of the @xmath12 interaction and also of the nature of the hyperon resonances . among those reactions ,",
    "the @xmath13 reaction is of particular interest .",
    "since there are no isospin-1 hyperons contributing here , this reaction gives us a rather clean platform to study the isospin zero @xmath14 resonances .",
    "furthermore , it is well known that the inelastic effects are especially important for the low energy @xmath12 interaction because the @xmath12 channel strongly couples to the @xmath15 channel through @xmath5 resonance ( spin - parity @xmath16 ) .",
    "thus , the @xmath13 reaction is a good place to study the @xmath5 state , whose structure and properties are still controversial , even it is catalogued as a four - star @xmath14 resonance in the particle data group ( pdg ) review book  @xcite .    in the traditional quark models ,",
    "the @xmath5 is described as a @xmath17wave @xmath18 baryon  @xcite , but it can also be explained as a @xmath12 molecule  @xcite or @xmath19 pentaquark state  @xcite . besides , it was also argued , within the unitary chiral theory  @xcite , two overlapping isospin @xmath20 states are dynamically generated and in this approach the shape of any observed @xmath5 spectrum might depend upon the production process . in a recent experimental study of the @xmath21 reaction  @xcite , the @xmath5 resonance was clearly identified through its @xmath22 decay and no obvious mass shift was found , which has been checked in ref .",
    "@xcite by using the effective lagrangian approach with considering only one @xmath5 state .",
    "however , the final answer is still absent in the sense that the experimental data could also be well described in the two - resonance scenario  @xcite .",
    "as shown in refs  @xcite , the combination of effective lagrangian approach and the isobar model is a good method to study the hadron resonances production in the @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath12 scattering .",
    "one key issue of this method is the coupling constant of the involved resonance interaction vertex , which can be obtained from the partial decay width .",
    "however , if the mass of the resonance is below the threshold of the corresponding channel , such as the @xmath5 ( @xmath25 mev ) to the @xmath12 ( @xmath26 mev ) channel , it is impossible to get the coupling constant within the above procedure .",
    "for example , the strong coupling constants of @xmath5 resonance were investigated within an extended chiral constituent quark model  @xcite , while in refs .",
    "@xcite , the coupling constant of @xmath27 was obtained from the studies of the @xmath28 reaction . besides , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the coupling constant of @xmath29 was studied from the analysis of the @xmath30 and the @xmath31 decays .",
    "moreover , the couplings of @xmath5 resonance to the @xmath12 and @xmath15 channels and the ratio of @xmath1 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 , have been intensively studied both experimentally  @xcite and within various theoretical approaches , for instance , the current algebra  @xcite , potential models  @xcite , dispersion relations  @xcite , asymptotic @xmath34 symmetry approach  @xcite , and they are also recently investigated by taking the @xmath5 resonance to be an admixture of traditional three - quark and higher five - quark fock components  @xcite . however , the obtained values of @xmath35 by different theoretical methods vary in a large range @xmath36 , so it is still worth to study the coupling constants @xmath1 and @xmath32 from other different ways .",
    "the present work we report here is one more in this line , by using an effective lagrangian approach and the isobar model , we extract the @xmath0 coupling constant @xmath1 by fitting it to the experimental data on the total cross sections of @xmath13 reaction near threshold .",
    "we also calculate the differential cross sections for the @xmath13 reaction with the fitted parameters .",
    "these model predictions can be checked by the future experiments . for simplicity",
    "we shall here work within the single @xmath5 state framework with parameters as reported in the pdg  @xcite .",

    "we introduce the theoretical formalism and ingredients for calculating the cross sections of the @xmath37 reaction within the effective lagrangian method .    the basic tree level feynman diagrams , for the @xmath2 reaction , are shown in fig .  [ feynfig ] .",

    "<S> the value of @xmath0 coupling constant @xmath1 is obtained by fitting it to the experimental data on the total cross sections of the @xmath2 reaction . on the basis of an effective lagrangian approach and isobar model , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the value @xmath3 could be extracted from the available experimental data by assuming that the @xmath4channel @xmath5 resonance plays the dominant role , while the background contributions from the @xmath4channel @xmath6 , @xmath7channel @xmath8 and @xmath9channel nucleon pole processes are small and can be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> however , the @xmath9channel nucleon pole diagram may also give an important contribution in present calculations . </S>",
    "<S> after the background contributions are taken into account , the above value of @xmath1 is reduced to @xmath10 , which is not supported by the previous calculations and the recent clas measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical calculations on differential cross sections are also presented , which can be checked by the future experiments . </S>"
