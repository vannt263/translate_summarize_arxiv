    "in this paper we study the applicability of nekhoroshev s theorem @xcite ( see also @xcite ) to the central motion .",
    "the main point is that nekhoroshev s theorem applies to perturbations of integrable systems whose hamiltonian is a _ steep _ function of the actions .",
    "even if such a property is known to be generic , it is very difficult ( and not at all explicit ) to verify it .",
    "here we prove that , under an explicit condition on the potential ( see eq . ) , the hamiltonian of the central motion is a quasi - convex function of the actions and thus it is steep , so that nekhoroshev s theorem applies .",
    "actually , the form of nekhoroshev s theorem used here is not the original one , but that for degenerate systems proved by fass in @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the hamiltonian of the central motion is a function of two actions only , namely , the modulus of the total angular momentum and the action of the effective one dimensional hamiltonian describing the motion of the radial variable .    on the one hand ,",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , this feature creates some problems for the proof of nekhoroshev s theorem , but these problems were solved in @xcite . on the other hand , degeneracy reduces the difficulty for the verification of steepness or of the strongest property of being quasi - convex , since , in the two - dimensional case , quasi - convexity is generic and equivalent to the nonvanishing of the arnold determinant    @xmath0    a property that it is not too hard to verify .    indeed , since is an analytic function of the actions , it is enough to show that it is different from zero at one point in order to ensure that it is different from zero almost everywhere . here",
    "we explicitly compute the expansion of @xmath1 at a circular orbit and we show that , provided the central potential @xmath2 does not satisfy identically a fourth order differential equation that we explicitly write , the hamiltonian @xmath1 is quasi - convex on an open dense domain ( whose complementary is possibly empty ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ statement ] we introduce the central motion problem and state the main results .",
    "[ proof ] contains all the proofs . in the appendix",
    "we prove that in the two dimensional case quasi - convexity is equivalent to arnold isoenergetic nondegeneracy condition .",
    "_ acknowledgements .",
    "_ we thank f. fass for a detailed discussion on action angle variables in the central motion problem , m. guzzo , l. niederman and g. pinzari for pointing to our attention some relevant references and a. maspero for interesting discussions .",
    "we first recall the structure of the action angle variables for the central motion . introducing polar coordinates",
    ", the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath3 and the actions on which @xmath4 depends are @xmath5 and the action @xmath6 of the effective one dimensional hamiltonian system @xmath7 by construction @xmath4 turns out to be a function of the two actions only .",
    "we still write @xmath8    according to fass s theorem , if @xmath4 depends on @xmath9 in a steep way , then nekhoroshev s estimate applies .",
    "we recall that steepness is actually implied by quasi - convexity , the property that we are now going to verify .    a function @xmath4 of the actions",
    "is said to be _ quasi - convex _ at a point @xmath10 if the system @xmath11 admits only trivial solutions . here",
    "we denoted by @xmath12 the second differential of @xmath4 at @xmath10 applied to the two vectors @xmath13 .    to define the set @xmath14 in which the actions vary we first assume that there exists an interval @xmath15 such that , for @xmath16 one has @xmath17 then we define @xmath18 and , in order to fix ideas , we assume that @xmath19 . then for @xmath20 , the effective potential @xmath21 has a non degenerate minimum at some @xmath22 .",
    "then , there exists a curve @xmath23 such that for @xmath24 , all the orbits of the hamiltonian are periodic .",
    "correspondingly , their action @xmath25 vary in some interval @xmath26 .",
    "thus , the domain @xmath27 of the actions @xmath28 has the form @xmath29 we remark that @xmath27 is simply connected , a property that will play an important role in the following .",
    "our main result is the following .",
    "[ teorema1 ] consider the hamiltonian @xmath30 with @xmath2 analytic on @xmath31 .",
    "assume that there exists a value @xmath32 of the radius such that the following fourth order equation @xmath33 is _ not _ satisfied .",
    "then , there exists a subset @xmath34 of the action space , with the property that its intersection with any compact set is composed by at most a finite number of lines , and such that @xmath4 restricted to @xmath35 is quasi - convex .",
    "the fourth order equation can be rewritten as a second order ordinary differential equation in terms of the variable @xmath36 , namely , @xmath37    it is interesting to see what are the homogeneous potentials which do not give rise to steep hamiltonians .",
    "thus take @xmath38 with @xmath39 , then the assumptions of theorem [ teorema1 ] are fulfilled if @xmath40 thus the excluded cases are the kepler and the harmonic potentials .",
    "we also remark that the equation has also the solution @xmath41 , which however is excluded by the second of .",
    "fix a positive parameter @xmath42 and denote by @xmath43 the open ball of radius @xmath42 and center @xmath28 and define @xmath44    we now consider a small perturbation @xmath45 of @xmath4 , with @xmath46 a function of the original cartesian coordinates @xmath47 in @xmath48 which is analytic .",
    "[ teorema2 ] fix a positive small parameter @xmath42 and consider the hamiltonian @xmath49 .",
    "then , for every compact set @xmath50 , there exist positive constants @xmath51 such that if the initial value @xmath52 of the actions fulfills @xmath53 and @xmath54 one has @xmath55 for all times @xmath56 satisfying @xmath57    the main dynamical consequence is that , as in the central motion , for any initial datum as above , there exist @xmath58 such that @xmath59 for the times .    actually , one can weaker the analyticity requirement on @xmath46 , since it would be enough to have that it is analytic on the set of @xmath60 and @xmath61 s such that the action is close to @xmath52 .",
    "the theorem holds also if one couples the system to an other system with a dynamic taking place over a much faster time scale . for example , this occurs in the case of a soliton interacting with radiation in the nls equation as in @xcite .",
    "as anticipated above , in the case of _ two _ actions , quasi - convexity is equivalent to the nonvanishing of the arnold determinant @xmath62 ( cf . ) .    in order to compute @xmath62",
    ", we have to compute @xmath63 . to do this we proceed as follows .    first ,",
    "as explained in sect .",
    "[ statement ] , it is easy to introduce the action @xmath64 which coincides with the modulus of the total angular momentum .",
    "then , @xmath6 is the action of the effective one dimensional system in which @xmath64 plays the role of a parameter . in order to have an explicit formula for the hamiltonian as a function of the actions , we work at circular orbits .",
    "precisely , we exploit the remark that in one dimensional systems birkhoff normal form converges in a neighborhood of a nondegenerate minimum . indeed , birkhoff normal form allows to construct an analytic canonical transformation which , in a neighborhood of the critical point , conjugates the hamiltonian @xmath4 to a function of the form @xmath65 which moreover is explicitly constructed as a power series in @xmath66 .",
    "thus , one can define the first action @xmath6 by @xmath67 .",
    "remark that , since , as a function of @xmath68 is analytic in a whole _ complex _",
    "neighborhood of zero , then @xmath63 is analytic for @xmath6 in a whole neighborhood of zero .",
    "then , from uniqueness of the actions in one dimensional systems , one has that the expression one gets is actually the expression of @xmath4 as a function of the actions as defined in sect .",
    "[ statement ] .",
    "it also follows that @xmath69 as a function of @xmath6 extends to a complex analytic function in whole neighborhood of zero , and such a function can be computed using the expression of @xmath4 obtained from .",
    "we use this remark in order to compute the arnold determinant at the equilibrium point @xmath70 of the effective one dimensional system described by @xmath4 , which coincides with a circular orbit of the original system .",
    "this can be done by computing explicitly the second order taylor expansion of @xmath4 which coincides with the fourth order birkhoff normal form of @xmath71 at @xmath70 .",
    "actually this was already done in @xcite getting @xmath72 where @xmath73    fix a point @xmath74 and let @xmath75 be the corresponding critical point of the effective potential .    inserting into the arnold determinant @xmath62 , the first and second derivatives of the hamiltonian evaluated at the point @xmath76",
    ", one gets @xmath77 where we denoted by @xmath78 thus , @xmath79 is equivalent to @xmath80 isolating the fourth order derivative of @xmath81 one gets @xmath82 using that @xmath70 is a critical point of @xmath83 , one can express @xmath74 in terms of @xmath70 , namely , @xmath84 and computing @xmath85 one can rewrite the equation in terms of the radius @xmath70 , obtaining the equation . thus ,",
    "if there exists @xmath70 such that is not satisfied , then at this point @xmath86 .",
    "this concludes the proof of the theorem .",
    "@xmath87    * proof of theorem [ teorema2 ] * from the previous result , one gets that the hamiltonian is quasi - convex on the subset @xmath88 with uniform bounds on the quasi - convexity constants .",
    "thus , if we choose an initial datum in such a set and a sufficiently small parameter @xmath89 , then fass s version of the nekhoroshev theorem for degenerate hamiltonians applies ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we remark that , in the case of quasi - convex hamiltonians , one gets optimal nekhoroshev s exponents which for two dimensional systems are @xmath90 .    @xmath87",
    "in this appendix we show that , in the two dimensional case , quasi - convexity is equivalent to the nonvanishing of the arnold determinant @xmath62 .",
    "we start by recalling the arnold condition .",
    "let @xmath4 be a complete integrable hamiltonian with @xmath91 degrees of freedom and frequency @xmath92 .",
    "then , @xmath4 is said to satisfy the _",
    "arnold condition _ at @xmath93 if the following map @xmath94 has maximal rank at @xmath95 .",
    "thus , we conclude that , in the case @xmath105 , the arnold condition is equivalent to the request of the second differential @xmath106 to be different from zero on the hyperplane generated by the vector @xmath107 normal to the gradient , namely , quasi - convexity ."
