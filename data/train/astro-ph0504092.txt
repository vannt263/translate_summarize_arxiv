    "the origin of the soft excess emission in galaxy clusters is yet uncertain .",

    "we establish the presence of the soft excess emission in our _ xmm - newton _   data , and provide the thermal and non - thermal modelling . in sections [ thermal ] and [ nonthermal ] we discuss the physical interpretation of the thermal and non - thermal models , comparing our results with the large scale simulations of cen and ostriker ( 1999 ) and of cheng et al .",

    "this behavior indicates the need for an additional spectral component , as will be discussed in section [ complexmodels ] .",
    "alternatively , we tried to account for cooler gas in the central regions using a classical cooling flow model , and fitted the 0.3 - 7 kev spectra of the inner annuli with a 1-temperature thermal model plus a cooling flow model .",
    "the fits are not acceptable and of same goodness - of - fit as those obtained using the 1-temperature thermal model plus the additional phase at 1/2 the temperature described above in this section .",
    "we investigate the possibility of modelling the srsic  159 - 03   spectra with the same 1-temperature thermal model of section [ 1 t ] , with the absorption column density as a free parameter .",
    "although the best - fit @xmath20 statistic improves , the fit is physically unacceptable , as the best - fit absorption column is significantly _",

    "the best - fit @xmath14 is consistent with null galactic absorption in certain annuli .",

    "next , we discard the low - energy portion of the spectra ( e@xmath02 kev ) from the fit , and fit the 2 - 7 kev data to the simple 1-temperature thermal model . in this case , we are no longer sensitive to the presence of the central ` cooling ' gas , and we drop the additional thermal model ( at 1/2 the temperature of the hot plasma ) from the 0 - 1 and 1 - 2 arcmin annuli .",
    "the results are now statistically acceptable , and the radial profiles of temperature and abundance are less steep than in the case of the 0.3 - 7 kev fit above ( figure [ profiles ] ) . in order to assess the presence of the soft excess emission , we extrapolate this best - fit hot icm model at lower energies in the same way as we did for the calibration source pks  2155 - 304 . strong soft excess emission is found in all annuli , as shown in figure [ as1101_4 - 6 ] for the 4 - 6 arcmin region . in figures",
    "[ fracxs ] and [ c ] we show the fractional excess in the 0.3 - 1 kev band , defined as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the observed soft flux , and @xmath23 is the prediction from the hot icm model .",
    "the soft excess exceeds the level of the calibration uncertainties ( see section [ calibration ] ) and it is therefore due to a genuine excess of soft x - ray radiation with respect to the 2 - 7 kev thermal model .",
    "it is important to stress that this model is not used to measure the soft excess flux , but only to establish the presence of an excess emission at low energy that can not be attributed to calibration uncertainties .",
    "soft excess fluxes will be measured by the models of section [ complexmodels ] . in fitting the 2 - 7 kev band alone",
    "we have ignored the fe - l complex , which is an important temperature diagnostic of the x - ray spectra .",
    "this model is also presented for the sake of comparison with earlier results , e.g. , those of nevalainen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , where the authors fit the 2 - 7 kev _ xmm - newton _ spectra of a3112 , a1795 and coma and find a fractional excess @xmath24 % ( see figures 4 and 5 of nevalainen et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "having established the presence of an extra soft component in the _ xmm - newton _   spectra of srsic  159 - 03 , we employ an additional component in the spectral fitting in order to account for the excess emission .",
    "first , we consider a 2-temperature model where both the hot icm temperature and the warm gas temperature are free parameters . in the innermost two annuli",
    "the hot thermal component features a @xmath25 sub - component , as described in section [ 1 t ] .",
    "this model constitutes a significant statistical improvement over the simple 1-temperature model ( see figure [ profiles ] ) .",
    "the residuals of the 2-temperature model are now consistent with the level of the calibration uncertainties , and are shown in figures [ a](b ) and [ b](b ) for two representative annuli .",
    "the additional thermal component features a temperature of @xmath260.2 - 0.8 kev and abundances of @xmath130.1 solar ( figure [ warmprofiles ] ) .",
    "the abundance and temperature of the warm phase are correlated parameters . in figure",
    "[ contour ] we show the contour plot of the two parameters for the region 4 - 6 arcmin , showing how the _ xmm - newton _ data can constrain the physical properties of the warm plasma model .",
    "similar results apply to the other regions .",
    "it is also clear , from the radial distribution of the emission integral ( @xmath27 ) of the two phases , that the warm phase dominates at large radii , where the hot icm emission becomes weak ( figure [ eiwarm_hot ] ) .",
    "we then consider a 1-temperature model plus a power - law component .",
    "this model is again an improvement over the simple 1-temperature model , and the @xmath20 fit statistic indicates that the 2-temperature model is only marginally preferred to this non - thermal model ( figure [ profiles ] ) .",
    "the residuals of this non - thermal model are shown in figures [ a](c ) and [ b](c ) for two representative annuli . in figure [ alphaprofiles ]",
    "we show the radial profiles of the power - law index of the power - law component .",
    "the 2-temperature model of section [ 2 t ] provides the most satisfactory fit to the 0.3 - 7 kev spectra . in the following we provide the physical interpretation of the thermal modelling of the soft excess emission discussing two possible scenarios .",
    "the warm gas responsible for the soft excess may be in a high - density ( @xmath28 @xmath29 ) and clumpy intra - cluster phase with volume filling factor @xmath30 .",
    "this is the scenario that results from the simulations of cheng et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , in which a small fraction of the intra - cluster gas remains at low temperature and high density during the accretion process .",
    "this phase of the intra - cluster medium is able to reproduce quantitatively the typical soft excess emission detected in several clusters ( e.g. , bonamente et al .",
    "we provide an estimate of the warm gas mass assuming that the warm gas is in pressure equilibrium with the hot gas .",
    "first , we deproject the emission integral @xmath31 of the hot phase ( figure [ eiwarm_hot ] ) to obtain the hot gas density ( figure [ density ] ) .",
    "our results for the hot gas density are in very good agreement with those from an earlier _ xmm - newton _ observation by kaastra et al .",
    "the warm gas density is then calculated assuming pressure equilibrium , @xmath32 , and it is in the @xmath33 @xmath29 range . using the measured emission integral of the warm phase , defined as @xmath34 , we estimate the volume filling factor @xmath35 and hence the warm gas mass .",
    "the volume filling factor is of a few percent ( @xmath36 ) and the total warm gas mass is @xmath37 m@xmath38 ( @xmath39 m@xmath38 from mos and @xmath40 m@xmath38 from pn data ) .",
    "for comparison , the hot gas mass is @xmath41 ( @xmath42 from mos and @xmath43 from pn data ) .",
    "reiprich and boheringer ( 2002 ) measure a total gravitational mass of @xmath44 out to the same radius of our analysis ( 0.9 mpc ) , resulting in a gas mass fraction of @xmath45 .",
    "if the excess emission follows the simple model presented in this section , the warm gas will contribute to an additional @xmath725% of the total baryonic mass .",
    "the cooling time of the warm gas is shorter than the hubble time at all radii , and the replenishment of the warm gas becomes a dynamical phenomenon .    for comparison with the soft excess of the coma cluster ( bonamente , joy and lieu 2003 ) we also estimate the warm gas mass in the case of an intra - cluster phase with volume filling factor @xmath46 . in this case",
    ", the warm gas would not be in pressure equilibrium with the hot gas and it would have a total mass of @xmath47 ( @xmath48 from mos and @xmath49 from pn data ) .",
    "this result is similar to that of coma , where and @xmath46 warm gas yielded @xmath50 ( bonamente , joy and lieu 2003 ) .",
    "if the soft excess emission is indeed clumpy as described by the cheng et al .",
    "( 2005 ) model , significant azimuthal variations of the excess could be present . in order to test the presence of azimuthal variations of the soft emitter , we divided the two annuli with the highest quality data ( 4 - 6 and 6 - 9 arcmin ) into quadrants , and applied to them the analysis described in section [ 2 - 7fit ] to measure the fractional excess in the 0.3 - 1 kev band . in figure [ d ]",
    "we plot the fractional excess detected in each quadrant , normalized by the average fractional excess in that annulus . at the resolution of our _ xmm - newton _ data we can not detect statistically significant azimuthal variations , although deviations at the level of @xmath1750% of the average are allowed by the data",
    ". a similar study of azimuthal variations of the soft excess in coma also yielded inconclusive results ( bonamente , joy and lieu 2003 ) .",
    "alternatively , the warm gas may be located in a diffuse halo or filaments around the cluster , not in direct contact with the hot icm and extending beyond the cluster s virial radius .",
    "we assume that the detected warm emission resides in filaments of constant density @xmath51 . in this case , the emission integral of each annulus becomes @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the volume of the filament , @xmath54 is the area of each annulus , and @xmath55 is the length of the filament along the line of sight . from the measured emission",

    "a population of relativistic electrons in the cluster would scatter the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , and give rise to soft x - ray radiation via an inverse compton scattering ( e.g. , huang 1997 ; sarazin and lieu 1998 ; lieu et al . 1999 ) . a relativistic electron with a lorentz factor @xmath77 will up - scatter a cmb photon to an energy of @xmath78 electrons with @xmath79",

    "the resuls are shown in figure [ pressure ] , which indicate that the non - thermal electron pressure is a few % of the thermal pressure at all radii .",
    "if the soft excess is of non - thermal nature , relativistic electrons must be present throughout the central 1 mpc radius of srsic  159 - 03 .",
    "the cluster has no known signature of non - thermal activity ( e.g. , no detected radio halo or strong radio sources ) .",
    "it is possible , however , that non - thermal activity may have occurred in the past .",
    "the steeper - than - galactic power law indices indicate an aging of the non - thermal population .",
    "the presence of relativistic particles at a distance of @xmath71 mpc from the cluster center is challenging .",
    "in fact , the bohm diffusion time for relativistic electrons exceeds a hubble time in the typical cluster environment ( volk , aharonian and breitschwerdt 1996 ) .",
    "the widespread presence of relativistic particles would require several sites of local acceleration , or alternative means of transport from the acceleration site to @xmath7mpc distances .",
    "the acceleration could be provided by several shocks ( e.g. , accretion shocks ) or , alternatively , agn jets , of which we have no evidence at present .",
    "diffuse shocks accelerate ions as well as electrons ( bell 1978a , b ; axford , leer and skadron 1977 ; blandford and ostriker 1978 ) .",
    "the ions , due to the higher mass , do not emit effectively , but will carry the bulk of the energy , exceeding the electron energy by a factor of @xmath94 .",
    "this in turn implies that the estimates of figure [ pressure ] will have to be increased by the same factor , with the relativistic particles now in approximate energy equipartition with the hot icm pressure .",
    "this result was already noted in the coma cluster ( lieu et al .",
    "1999 ) and in our previous study of srsic  159 - 03   with rosat data",
    "( bonamente , lieu and mittaz 2001 ) . with the current _ xmm - newton _   data we have provided more precise estimates of the non - thermal pressure in srsic  159 - 03",
    "the presence of relativistic ions can only be avoided if the electrons are accelerated by an alternative means that do not accelerate the ions , such as agn electron / positron jets .",
    "the soft excess emission of srsic  159 - 03 is of genuine celestial origin .",
    "knowledge of the _ xmm - newton _ detectors and direct use of the calibration source pks  2155 - 304 ( section [ calibration ] ) showed that the emission is not a detector artifact .",
    "moreover , the emission can not be caused by wrong assumptions on the hi galactic absorbing column . in order to explain the excess emission , the galactic column density is required to be more than two times _ lower _ than the measured galactic value ( @xmath95 @xmath16 ) and even lower than the lockman hole value ( @xmath96 @xmath16 ) for certain annuli .",
    "bregman et al . ( 2003 ) showed that anisotropies in the distribution of the hi column density towards galaxy clusters may affect the transmission of extragalactic soft x - ray radiation .",
    "such effect , however , is only relevant at energies @xmath97 kev ( e.g. , figures 1 and 9 of bregman et al . 2003 ) , and it has no influence on the soft excess detected in this paper at @xmath98 kev with the _ xmm - newton _ detectors .",
    "the thermal and non - thermal models examined in this paper constrain the nature of the soft excess emission from srsic  159 - 03 .",
    "the formal @xmath20 goodness - of - fit statistic does not provide a definitive indication of the origin of the soft emission .",
    "the thermal scenario is only marginally favored over the non - thermal ( figure [ profiles ] ) , similarly to the case of the coma cluster ( bonamente , joy and lieu 2003 ) .",
    "the large extent of the detected excess emission ( @xmath7 1 mpc radius ) renders unlikely a purely non - thermal interpretation of the excess , due to the long diffusion times of relativistic particles which can not easily diffuse throughout the entire cluster volume ( see section [ nonthermal ] ) .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ data of srsic  159 - 03 indicate that warm gas located within the virial radius provides the bulk of the soft excess radiation",
    ". the gas may be in a clumpy phase of the icm ( section [ cheng ] ) as advocated by the simulations of cheng et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , with a mass of 25% of the hot gas mass .",
    "although we do not confirm the direct detection of ovii and oviii emission lines associated with the excess emission , the warm gas emission is consistent with a metal abundance of a few % solar .",
    "the soft emission is unlikely to originate from large - scale filaments _  la cen and ostriker ( 1999 ) _ , which would encompass a total mass in excess of that of the hot icm .",
    "it is possible that a fraction of the soft excess , especially in the central regions , is of non - thermal nature ( section [ nonthermal ] ) .",
    "although there is no evidence at present of non - thermal activity in srsic  159 - 03 , past agn or diffusive shock acceleration may have fostered the presence of relativistic electrons in the cluster environment .",
    "our calculations show that the relativistic particles would be near or below pressure equipartition with the hot gas .",
    "the initial report of soft excess in srsic  159 - 03 was based on low resolution _",
    "rosat _ pspc data ( bonamente , lieu and mittaz 2001 ) .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "data were able to detect soft excess emission out to a radius of @xmath79 arcmin .",
    "the mass estimates for the warm intra - cluster gas model had significantly larger errors , but are in agreement with the present _ xmm - newton _ results .",
    "the non - thermal fit results based on these earlier data have a power - law index that is significantly higher than that of the present analysis ( see table 2 of bonamente , lieu and mittaz 2001 ) .",
    "the reason is likely attributable to the narrower _ rosat _ band , and it is the cause for the higher non - thermal perssure estimates we obtained based on that observation .",
    "the first _ xmm - newton _",
    "results on srsic  159 - 03 were based on an earlier @xmath99 ks observation , and are described in kaastra et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . in that paper",
    "no attempt was made to detect or measure the soft excess , but the authors focused on the properties of the hot gas .",
    "our estimates of the hot gas temperature , abundance and density are in good agreement with theirs ( see figures 13 of kaastra et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "kaastra et al .",
    "( 2003 ) analyzed the same _ xmm - newton _ observation as kaastra et al .",
    "( 2001 ) in order to investigate the soft excess emission .",
    "they report the presence of soft excess emission out to a radius of @xmath712 arcmin , in agreement with our present results .",
    "their thermal and non - thermal models for the excess emission also indicate that the two models have similar goodness of fit in the central regions , in agreement with our present findings .",
    "the backround subtraction technique they employ , however , differs from the one used in this paper in that we now use a local background .",
    "the different background subtraction is the reason for a variance with our results at large radii , e.g. , their detection of ovii emission lines associated with the soft excess emitter is not confirmed in our analysis ( see section [ background ] ) .",
    "the same authors provide an estimate of the warm gas mass in kaastra et al .",
    "( 2004b ) , based on the same earlier _ xmm - newton _ observation .",
    "their warm gas estimate follows a model reminiscent of our warm intergalactic filaments _  la cen and ostriker ( 1999)_. they assume a fiducial radius for the volume of the emission and estimate a constant density for the warm gas , and find a warm gas mass of @xmath100 , higher than our corresponding estimate by a factor of @xmath710 . the difference can be explained by the simplifying assumptions of their model .",
    "the properties of the central ` cooling ' gas of srsic  159 - 03 were also studied in detail by kaastra et al .",
    "( 2004a ) .",
    "they find that cooling gas is significantly present only at radii @xmath02 arcmin .",
    "our best - fit hot icm temperatures are again in agreement with those of kaastra et al .",
    "( 2004a ) .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed a high s / n _ xmm - newton _ observation of srsic  159 - 03and provided a wide range of models for the soft excess emission .",
    "we employed a different method of background subtraction than the earlier _ xmm - newton _ observations of kaastra et al .",
    "( 2003 ) which accounts for spatial variations of the soft x - ray background .",
    "first , we showed that soft excess emission is strongly detected throughout a @xmath101 mpc radius region , confirming earlier detections based on lower s / n data ( kaastra et al .",
    "2003 ; bonamente , lieu and mittaz 2001 ) .",
    "we ruled out the possibility that the excess emission is caused by peculiarities in the absorbing column of galactic gas , or that the emission is an artifact of the _ xmm - newton _ detectors .",
    "we then investigated several thermal and non - thermal models in search of the origin of the soft excess emission .",
    "the thermal models assume the presence of warm ( @xmath102 k ) gas either intermixed with the hot gas , or in diffuse structures extending beyond the cluster virial radius . the non - thermal model requires the widespread presence of relativistic electrons with lorentz factor @xmath103 .",
    "we calculated the density and mass budget for the thermal models and the pressure budget for the non - thermal model , and concluded that the most likely interpretation for the soft excess emission of srsic  159 - 03 is warm gas located within the virial radius of the cluster , which contributes an additional 25% of the total cluster baryonic mass .",
