    "recently an interest is shown in the literature to the problem of a quantum particle on the circle and on the sphere . in overcomplete families of states ( coherent states ) for these systems are constructed .",
    "one of the difficulties for these systems is the position ( and momentum ) uncertainty measures for the particle ( or equivalently , the wave function spread measure ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the issue related the choice of the operator for the azimuthal angle @xmath0 . for a particle on the sphere",
    "there is a second problem , related to the non - hermiticity of the operator @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the longitudinal angle .",
    "the problem of correct definitions of uncertainty measures is ( and should be ) closely related to the construction and justification of the uncertainty relations ( ur s ) , and of coherent and squeezed states as well .    from the dirac correspondence rule between poisson bracket @xmath3 of two classical quantities @xmath4 and @xmath5 and the commutator of the corresponding operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 ,    \\{f , g } [ , ] it follows that @xmath8 = -{{\\mathrm{i}}}$ ] , where @xmath9 is the azimuthal angle operator , and @xmath10 is the angular momentum operator .",
    "formally this commutation relation is satisfied by @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "then one can write the standard heisenberg - robertson ur @xmath13 .    however on the eigenstates @xmath14 of @xmath10 ,    _ m ( ) = ( m)/,m=0,1,  the above ur breaks down .",
    "the reasons for this contradiction is the fact , that @xmath10 is not hermitian on the @xmath15-transformed state @xmath16 , since @xmath17 is no more invariant under translations on @xmath18 ( no more @xmath18 invariant ) .",
    "therefore many authors try to adopt some @xmath18-invariant position operator , or even another definition of the uncertainty on the circle .",
    "however almost all of the associated uncertainty measures are not in good consistency with the localization of the particle on the circle .    in the case of a particle on the sphere",
    "the situation is even worth since in addition to the problems with the @xmath15 and @xmath19 , one encounters the subtle of non - hermiticity of the operator @xmath20 , related to the longitudinal angle coordinate @xmath2 , @xmath21 .    in this paper",
    "we provide an approach to these issues with minimal ( in our opinion ) deviation from the standard commutation relation and standard measure of uncertainty . in the case of a particle on the circle",
    "the main idea has been sketched in the second paper in , and developed in greater detail ( providing some proofs and examples ) in the first paper in .    in section 2 a brief review of the properties of main previous position uncertainty measures on the circle ( based on @xmath18-periodic operator @xmath9 )",
    "is provided . in section 3 two different position uncertainty measures for a particle on the sphere are constructed and discussed . at @xmath22 the corresponding states and measures on a circle are recovered .",
    "the new measures are constructed using suitably the standard expressions of the first and second moments of the angle variable , calculated by integration over @xmath18 intervals .",
    "they are of the form of positive state functionals , the values of which depend solely on the state considered . in section uncertainty relations ( ur s ) ( of the robertson  schrdinger type )",
    "are established for the position delocalization measures and the appropriate _",
    "complementary measures_. the latters are of the form of standard variances of @xmath10 and new hermitian operators @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "for a particle on the real line the standard measure of the position uncertainty is given by the second moment @xmath25 of the position operator @xmath26 , or equivalently by the standard deviation @xmath27 .",
    "mathematically both @xmath28 and @xmath29 are one - to - one functionals on state space .",
    "the quantity @xmath30 is also called variance , or dispersion , of @xmath31 and is also denoted as @xmath32 or @xmath33 . the variance of @xmath31 is regarded as a measure of spread , or delocalization , of the state wave function @xmath34 . more precisely this is a measure of spread of the probability distribution @xmath35 . here",
    "the means @xmath36 and @xmath37 are calculated by integration with respect to @xmath31 : @xmath38 .",
    "however in the case of angle operator @xmath39 it was not clear how to calculate and interpret the analogous quantity @xmath40 , since the operator @xmath39 is not invariant under translation @xmath41 ( not @xmath18-periodic ) , while the wave functions @xmath42 are @xmath18-periodic by definition .",
    "this trouble seems to be the main reason why many authors look for @xmath18-invariant position operators in order to construct relevant uncertainty measures on the circle .",
    "the first such operators used probably were @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the variances of these operators satisfy correct inequalities @xcite    ( p_)^2()^2 ||^2/4,(p_)^2()^2 ||^2/4 however one easily find states in which the variances @xmath45 and @xmath46 take values greater than the corresponding ones in the uniform distribution @xmath47 , while in @xmath48 these variances are @xmath49 , @xmath50 . in @xmath51",
    "they are interchanged ",
    "@xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "the two states @xmath54 and @xmath55 coincide under the shift @xmath56 , therefore it is reasonable to have coinciding ( or close ) measures of spread for them , which should be less than those in the eigenstates @xmath14 .",
    "these deficiencies are partially removed by the `` uncertainty measure '' @xmath57 , which can be written also in the forms    ( ) ^2 = 1 - ^2 - ^2 = 1 - |u()|^2 , u()=e^i the quantity @xmath58 has been considered also in and . in it was noted that @xmath58 has the meaning of radial distance of the centroid of the ring distribution @xmath59 from the circle line ( and @xmath60 is the squared centroid s distance from the center of the circle  see figure 1 in ) . from ( [ tlddlt ] ) and ( [ ursin ] ) it follows that",

    "( [ tlddlt ] ) , as a delocalization measure on the circle one encounters some unsatisfactory results . for example , it produces the same maximal delocalization ( i.e. @xmath64 ) for the eigenstates @xmath14 of @xmath10 and for all states @xmath42 with the property @xmath65 .",
    "the centroid for those @xmath66-periodic distributions @xmath67 is in the center of the ring . on figure 1",
    "graphics of three @xmath66-periodic distributions are shown : uniform one @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "it is clear that the localization of that distributions is quite different , and it is desirable to have an uncertainty measure that distinguishes between them .",
    "a rather nonstandard expressions for position and angular momentum uncertainties for a particle on the circle were introduced and discussed in :    ^2 ( _ ) = 14 ( e^-2_e^2_),^2 ( ) = -14 |u()^2|^2 for a large sets of states these quantities obey the inequality @xmath71 , the equality being reached in the eigenstates @xmath72 of the operator @xmath73 .",
    "the family of @xmath72 is overcomplete and the states @xmath72 are called cs on the circle .",
    "the functional @xmath74 , based on the @xmath18-invariant operator @xmath75 ( @xmath76 was proposed as a position uncertainty on the circle .",
    "however this uncertainty measure was found to be not quite consistent with state localization : on cs @xmath72 it equals @xmath77 , while on the visually worse localized states @xmath78 ( schrdinger cat states on the circle ) it can take rather less value of @xmath79 ( see and figure 2 therein ) . on the above noted states @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath14 it takes values @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath83 .",

    "we have to apply some criterions .",
    "one such criterion could be the demand that the complementary measure @xmath278 be minimal ( with respect to @xmath221 ) in the most delocalized state @xmath279 .",
    "numerical calculations show that this criterion selects @xmath280 and @xmath281 :    in @xmath282 we find @xmath283 .",
    "note that the variances of @xmath23 on @xmath284 do depend on the phase @xmath285 when the latter is a function of angle @xmath2 .",
    "another natural criterion is the lower limit ot the product @xmath286 , for which one has the standard ur ( p_n)^2 ( ) ^2 |^n|^2/4 it is clear that in any state the inequality @xmath287 holds .",

    "we may denote this @xmath2-complementary measure as @xmath291 , i.e. we put @xmath292 . in the two states",
    "@xmath128 and two cs @xmath121 represented in figures 2 , 3 and 4 , 5 the values of @xmath289 are @xmath293 and @xmath294 respectively .",
    "it is remarkable that in cs @xmath295 with @xmath169 the @xmath2-position uncertainty is approximately equal to the complementary one : @xmath296 .",
    "this is to be compared with the case of cs on the plane , where the two complementary uncertainties ( position and momentum uncertainties ) are equal ( in any cs however ) .",
    "thus the hermitian operator @xmath297 could be examined as a momentum @xmath298 complementary to the variable @xmath2 .",
    "the four measures on the sphere @xmath254 , @xmath256 , @xmath299 , and @xmath291 satisfy the generalized robertson ur ( [ detg ] ) , where the integration with respect to @xmath2 in all matrix elements involving the variable @xmath15 should be from @xmath247 to @xmath248 .",
    "let us note that the means @xmath300 , where @xmath301 are the two hermitian operators , `` conjugated '' to the stereographic coordinates @xmath196 ( [ q_i ] ) , are divergent .",
    "thus these operators move the most delocalized state @xmath282 ( and many other states as well ) away from the appropriate hilbert space , and their variances are not convenient as complementary to the position uncertainty measures on the sphere .",
    "we have constructed two position uncertainty measures @xmath302 , @xmath256 and two related complementary measures @xmath303 , @xmath291 for a particle on the sphere .",
    "the @xmath2-complementary measure @xmath291 is a variance of the new operator @xmath297 , eq.([p_n ] ) .",
    "the four measures obey the genralized robertson ur ( [ detg ] ) , any two of them satisfying the schrdinger - robertson type ur ( [ gsur ] ) .",
    "the relevance of the constructed measures are illustrated on the example of two sets of states : @xmath128 , eq .",
    "( [ fuvk ] ) , and coherent states on the sphere @xmath121 , eq .",
    "( [ psics ] ) .",
    "the relevance of @xmath254 as a position measure should not be considered as a proof that the right position operator @xmath304 for the azimuthal angle is the multiplication by @xmath15 .",
