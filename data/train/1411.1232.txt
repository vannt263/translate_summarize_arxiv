    "by using high - quality single crystals of fese ( _ si text 1 _ , figs.s1 and s2 ) which have become available recently , we have measured the transport properties ( fig.1_a _ ) . in zero field , the temperature dependence of the resistivity @xmath26 can be described by @xmath27 with @xmath28 below 25k .",
    "taking @xmath29 cm as upper limit of @xmath23 leads to @xmath30 , i.e. , a factor of 10 higher than previous samples . in the present crystals",
    "@xmath31 defined by the zero resistivity is 9.5k , which is higher than @xmath32k of the low @xmath24 samples @xcite .",
    "a remarkably large magnetoresistance ( inset of fig.1_a _ ) not observed in previously studied low-@xmath24 crystals @xcite , supports that the crystal is very clean ( _ si text 2 _ , fig.s3_a _ ) .",
    "the strongly @xmath33-dependent hall coefficient @xmath34 below @xmath1760k indicates that the electron and hole mobilities are of the same order ( _ si text 2 _ , fig.s3_b _ ) .",
    "the london penetration depth @xmath35 shows a quasi @xmath33-linear dependence , @xmath36 , for @xmath37 , suggesting the presence of line nodes in the superconducting gap ( fig.1_b _ ) .",
    "figure1_c _ shows the tunneling conductance which is proportional to the density of states , measured with a scanning tunneling microscope at 0.4k .",
    "the v - shaped spectrum at low bias voltages likewise indicates the presence of line nodes , which is consistent with previously reported observations @xcite .",
    "we note that the line nodes are accidental , not symmetry protected , i.e. , the gap function is extended @xmath38-wave , because the nodes are absent in samples with low @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "distinct peaks and shoulder structures in the spectra indicate the presence of ( at least ) two superconducting gaps ( @xmath39 2.5 and 3.5mev ) , reflecting the multiband nature .     of fese .",
    "the structural transition occurs at @xmath1890k .",

    "the high quality of the single crystals enables us to estimate the fermi energies @xmath47 and @xmath48 from the band edges of electron and hole sheets , respectively , by using several techniques ; all of them consistently point to extremely small fermi energies . in 2d systems @xmath0",
    "is related to @xmath49 as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the interlayer distance and @xmath52 is the vacuum permeability . from the @xmath33 dependence of @xmath53",
    ", we obtain @xmath54  nm ( fig.1_b _ , _ si text 3 _ , fig.s4 ) @xcite . very recent quantum oscillation measurements on the present fese crystals revealed that the fermi surface consists of one hole sheet and one ( compensating ) electron sheet ( see fig.2_a _ ) @xcite .",
    "then @xmath35 can be written as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 represent the contribution from the electron and hole sheets , respectively .",
    "assuming that two sheets have similar effective masses as indicated by the hall effect ( see below and _ si text 2 _ ) , we estimate @xmath58mev .",
    "the magnitude of the fermi energy can also be inferred from the thermoelectric response in the normal state ( _ si text 2 _ ) . from the seebeck coefficient @xmath59 , the upper limit of @xmath47",
    "is deduced to be @xmath17 10mev ( _ si text 2 _ , fig.s3_c _ ) . moreover , the sign change of @xmath60 at 60k ( _",
    "si text 2 _ , fig.s3_b _ ) indicates that the fermi energies @xmath47 and @xmath48 are of similar size , a feature also observed in underdoped cuprate superconductors with small electron and hole pockets @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the cuprate case , however , @xmath34 in fese almost vanishes at high temperatures , which sheds light on the unique feature of fese with extremely small fermi energy .    we can determine the electron and hole fermi energies directly by measuring the electronic dispersion curves in momentum space yielding @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) for the hole ( electron ) band . here",
    "@xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) is the energy of the top ( bottom ) of the hole ( electron ) band and @xmath65 is the electrochemical potential . for this assignment",
    ", we exploit spectroscopic - imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to observe the quasiparticle interference ( qpi ) patterns  @xcite associated with electron waves scattered off by defects . by taking the fourier transform of energy - dependent normalized conductance images , characteristic",
    "wave vectors of electrons at different energies reflecting the band dispersion , can be determined ( _ si text 4 _ ) .",
    "the observed qpi patterns of fese at 1.5k ( _ si text 4 _ , fig.s5 ) consist of hole- and electron - like branches that disperse along the crystallographic @xmath66 and @xmath67 directions , respectively .",
    "these branches can naturally be ascribed to the hole and electron sheets illustrated in fig.2_a_. the qpi signals exhibit a strong in - plane anisotropy .",
    "such an anisotropy is consistent with the largely elongated vortex core structure  @xcite .",
    "the origin of the strong in - plane anisotropy of the qpi signals is unclear , but a possible cause may be the orbital ordering in the orthorhombic phase .        as shown in figs.2_b _ and 2_c _ , full dispersion curves of hole- and electron - like branches are clearly identified by taking linecuts from the series of fourier - transformed conductance images ( _ si text 4 _ , fig.s5 ) . here , a magnetic field @xmath68 t is applied parallel to the @xmath69 axis ( @xmath41 ) to mostly suppress superconductivity .",
    "multiple hole - like branches are identified in fig.2_b_. since qpi signals include both intra- and interband scattering processes , it is difficult to disentangle all the qpi branches in order to resolve the bare band structure .",
    "nevertheless , the top of the hole band can be faithfully determined to yield @xmath70 10mev from the highest energy of the top - most branch .",
    "this branch is quantitatively consistent with the intra - band scattering associated with the @xmath71-band detected by arpes @xcite . in the case of the electron - like branch , an even smaller band bottom of @xmath72 2 3mev",
    "is estimated ( fig.2_c _ ) .",
    "these small values are consistent with the ones estimated from the superfluid and thermoelectric responses . the effective mass of electron ( hole ) determined by qpi assuming parabolic dispersion is 2.5@xmath73 ( 3.5@xmath73 ) , where @xmath73 is the free - electron mass .",
    "the observation of comparable effective masses of electrons and holes is consistent with the hall - effect data ( _ si text 2 _ ) .",
    "we stress that the electronic structure obtained from qpi , including masses of electron and hole , the size and the number of each pocket , and the magnitude of the fermi energies , is consistent with the values recently reported by the quantum oscillations in the quantitative level @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the superconducting gaps are of the same order as the fermi energy of each band , @xmath74 ( fig.2_d _ ) and @xmath75 ( fig . ) , implying the bcs - bec crossover regime . additional strong support of the crossover is provided by extremely small @xmath76 14 .",

    "( fig.2_b _ ) is roughly 0.3 ( 0.75)nm@xmath78 , and @xmath79 determined from the upper critical field ( @xmath80 t ) is roughly 5 nm .",
    "so far we discussed the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "how does the zeeman energy scale @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the bohr magneton , enter the game ?",
    "the thermal conductivity @xmath83 is well suited to address the issue of how the magnetic field affects the extraordinary pairing state by probing quasiparticle excitations out of the superconducting condensate , as the cooper pair condensate does not contribute to heat transport .",
    "figure3_a _ shows the @xmath33 dependence of @xmath84 in zero field . below @xmath7 , @xmath83",
    "is enhanced due to the suppression of quasiparticle scattering rates owing to the gap formation . as shown in the inset of fig.3_a _ , @xmath84 at low temperatures is well fitted as @xmath85 , similar to tl@xmath86ba@xmath86cuo@xmath87  @xcite .",
    "the presence of the residual @xmath88 at @xmath89 is consistent with line nodes in the gap .",
    "figure3_b _ shows the @xmath90 dependence of @xmath84 for @xmath41 well below @xmath7 obtained after averaging over many field sweeps at constant temperatures . beyond the initial steep drop at low fields , likely caused by the suppression of the quasiparticle",
    "mean free path @xmath91 through the introduction of vortices , @xmath92 becomes nearly @xmath90-independent .",
    "similar behavior has been reported for bi@xmath86sr@xmath86cacu@xmath86o@xmath93 @xcite and cecoin@xmath94 @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the nearly @xmath90-independent @xmath83 reflects a compensation between the enhancement of the density of states by magnetic field in nodal superconductors ( doppler shift ) and the concomitant reduction in @xmath91 due to increased scattering from vortices @xcite . at high fields , above the smoothly varying background ,",
    "@xmath92 exhibits a cusp - like feature at a field @xmath95 that is practically independent of @xmath33 .",
    "the height of the cusp - like peak decreases with increasing @xmath33 . to further analyze our data , the @xmath84 values at different temperatures are extrapolated to @xmath96 for each field value measured to yield @xmath97 as shown in fig.3_c _ , corroborating the robustness of the cusp . in particular , the cusp of @xmath88 is unrelated to phonon heat transport because phonons do not contribute to @xmath84 for @xmath98 .",
    "since the thermal conductivity has no fluctuation corrections @xcite , the cusp of @xmath83 usually corresponds to the mean - field phase transition .",
    "we note that at @xmath99 the field dependence of magnetic torque shows no discernible anomaly ( _ si text 5 _ , fig.s7 ) .",
    "however , such a difference of the sensitivity to the transition in different measurements has been reported for the field - induced transition between two superconducting phases in cecoin@xmath94 , which is hardly resolved in magnetization@xcite , despite clear anomaly in some other bulk probes@xcite .",
    "moreover , the hysteresis in the magnetization due to vortex pinning may smear out a possible torque anomaly at @xmath99 .    .",

    ", @xmath84 shows a cusp - like peak , suggestive of a nearly temperature - independent transition ( dashed line ) . at 1.5k",
    ", the cusp disappears and a weak structure ( within the accuracy of the measurement ) is observed at lower field .",
    "( _ c _ ) : magnetic - field dependence of @xmath84 in the zero - temperature limit , @xmath88 , obtained by linear extrapolation of @xmath84 versus @xmath33 at low temperatures ]    figure4 displays the @xmath90-@xmath33 phase diagram for @xmath41 .",
    "the irreversibility fields @xmath100 at low temperatures extend to fields well above @xmath95 , indicating that @xmath95 is located inside the superconducting state .",
    "the anomaly at @xmath95 is not caused by some changes of the flux - line lattice , such as melting transition , because the peak field determined by the torque is strongly @xmath33-dependent and well below @xmath95 ( _ si text 5 _ , fig.s7 ) , indicating that the flux - line lattice is already highly disordered at @xmath95 .    as shown in the inset of fig.1_a",
    "_ , the resistivity at @xmath101 t increases with decreasing temperature and decreases after showing a broad maximum at around 15k .",
    "the @xmath33-dependence at high temperature is a typical behavior of the very pure compensated semimetals .",
    "however , the decrease of the resistivity at low temperature regime is not expected in conventional semimetals .",
    "this unusual decrease may be attributed to the strong superconducting fluctuations above @xmath100 ( inset of fig.4 ) . in higher fields",
    "the fluctuation region expands to higher @xmath102 .",
    "in fact , the ginzburg number , which is given by @xmath103 within the bcs framework @xcite , is orders of magnitude larger than in any other superconductors .",
    "this large range of fluctuations may be related to the presence of preformed pairs predicted in the bcs - bec crossover regime @xcite .",
    "the appearance of the high - field phase ( b - phase in fig.4 ) where three characteristic energy scales are comparable , @xmath104 , suggests a phase transition of the fermi liquid with strong spin imbalance in the bcs - bec crossover regime .",
    "whether the observed distinct phase arises from strong spin imbalance and/or a bcs - bec crossover , however , needs to be resolved in the future with particular attention to multiband effects .",
    "we discuss two possible scenarios .",
    "( 1 ) the phase line might signal an electronic transition akin to a lifshitz transition , i.e. , a topology change of the fermi surface . indeed",
    "the phase line would be independent of @xmath33 and smeared by thermal fluctuations .",
    "however , the fact that this phase line vanishes at @xmath100 would be accidental .",
    "furthermore , the absence of any discernible anomaly in torque magnetometry at @xmath95 ( _ si text 5 _ , fig.s7 ) implies that the @xmath92 anomaly at @xmath95 is not caused by a lifshitz transition nor , for that matter , by a spin - density - wave type of magnetic order .",
    "( 2 ) comparable fermi and zeeman energies may lead to an unprecedented superconducting state of highly spin - polarized electrons , such as spin - triplet pairing and an admixture of even- and odd - frequency pairing @xcite .",
    "comparable gap and zeeman energies may alternatively induce a fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo)-like state with cooper pairs having finite total momentum ( @xmath105 , @xmath106 ) owing to the pairing channel between the zeeman - split fermi surfaces @xcite .",
    "the fflo state requires a large maki parameter , i. e. , a ratio of orbital and pauli - paramagnetic limiting fields , @xmath107 in the bcs limit . in this regime , @xmath108 , yielding , for fese , @xmath109",
    "as large as @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) in the electron ( hole ) pockets .",
    "this estimate may be questionable in the regime of @xmath112 for fese . in any case",
    ", we stress that the high - field phase is not a simple fflo phase because in the multiband superconductor fese the interaction between electron and hole bands is crucial . even in the single band systems , it has been suggested that the fflo state becomes unstable in the crossover regime @xcite .",
    "our work should motivate further studies in the field of strongly interacting fermi liquids near the bcs - bec crossover regime and in the presence of large spin imbalance , which remains largely unexplored and might bridge the areas of condensed - matter and ultracold - atom systems .",

    "<S> fermi systems in the crossover regime between weakly coupled bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) and strongly coupled bose - einstein - condensate ( bec ) limits are among the most fascinating objects to study the behavior of an assembly of strongly interacting particles . </S>",
    "<S> the physics of this crossover has been of considerable interest both in the fields of condensed matter and ultracold atoms . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most challenging issue in this regime is the effect of large spin imbalance on a fermi system under magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> although several exotic physical properties have been predicted theoretically , the experimental realization of such an unusual superconducting state has not been achieved so far . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that pure single crystals of superconducting fese offer the possibility to enter the previously unexplored realm where the three energies , fermi energy @xmath0 , superconducting gap @xmath1 and zeeman energy , become comparable . through the superfluid response , </S>",
    "<S> transport , thermoelectric response , and spectroscopic - imaging scanning tunneling microscopy , we demonstrate that @xmath0 of fese is extremely small , with the ratio @xmath2 in the electron ( hole ) band . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , thermal - conductivity measurements give evidence of a distinct phase line below the upper critical field , where the zeeman energy becomes comparable to @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of this field - induced phase provides insights into previously poorly understood aspects of the highly spin - polarized fermi liquid in the bcs - bec crossover regime .     </S>",
    "<S> * significance + the bcs - bec crossover bridges the two important theories of bound particles in a unified picture with the ratio of the attractive interaction to the fermi energy as a tuning parameter . </S>",
    "<S> a key issue is to understand the intermediate regime , where new states of matter may emerge . here , we show that the fermi energy of fese is extremely small , resulting in that this system can be regarded as an extraordinary  high - temperature \" superconductor located at the verge of a bcs - bec crossover . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , we discover the emergence of an unexpected superconducting phase in strong magnetic fields , demonstrating that the zeeman splitting comparable to the fermi energy leads to a strong modification of the properties of fermionic systems in such a regime . + *    uperconductivity in most metals is well explained by the weak - coupling bcs theory , where the pairing instability arises from weak attractive interactions in a degenerate fermionic system . in the opposite limit of bec , </S>",
    "<S> composite bosons consisting of strongly coupled fermions condense into a coherent quantum state @xcite . in bcs superconductors , </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting transition temperature is usually several orders of magnitude smaller than the fermi temperature , @xmath3-@xmath4 , while in the bec limit @xmath5 is of the order of @xmath6 . even in the high-@xmath7 cuprates , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 is merely of the order of @xmath8 at optimal doping . </S>",
    "<S> of particular interest is the bcs - bec crossover regime with intermediate coupling strength . in this regime </S>",
    "<S> the size of interacting pairs ( @xmath9 ) , which is known as the coherence length , becomes comparable to the average distance between particles ( @xmath10 ) , i.e. , @xmath11 @xcite , where @xmath12 is the fermi momentum . </S>",
    "<S> this regime is expected to have the highest values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 ever observed in any fermionic superfluid .    </S>",
    "<S> one intriguing issue concerns the role of spin imbalance , whether it will lead to a strong modification of the properties of the fermi system in the crossover regime . </S>",
    "<S> this problem has been of considerable interest not only in the context of superconductivity but also in ultracold - atom physics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , such fermi systems have been extremely hard to access . in superconductors </S>",
    "<S> , the spin imbalance can be introduced through the zeeman effect by applying a strong magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> again , in the high-@xmath7 cuprates , the zeeman energy at the upper critical field at @xmath15 is of the order of only @xmath16 . in ultracold atoms , although several exotic superfluid states have been proposed @xcite , cooling the systems down to sufficiently low temperature ( @xmath15 ) is not easily attained .    </S>",
    "<S> fese provides an ideal platform for studying a highly spin - polarized fermi system in the crossover regime . </S>",
    "<S> fese is the simplest iron - based layered superconductor ( inset of fig.1_a _ ) with @xmath7 of @xmath179k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the structural transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic crystal symmetry occurs at @xmath18 90k and a large electronic in - plane anisotropy appears . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the other iron - based compounds , no magnetic order occurs below @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> a prominent feature of the pseudobinary  11 \" family ( fese@xmath20te@xmath21 ) is the presence of very shallow pockets , as reported by angle - resolved photoemission - spectroscopy ( arpes ) . </S>",
    "<S> although a possible bcs - bec crossover has been suggested in the bands around the @xmath22-point @xcite , it is still an open question whether all bands are in such a crossover regime . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it should be noted that high - quality single crystals are highly requisite for the study of the crossover regime , as exotic superconductivity often is extremely sensitive to impurities . </S>",
    "<S> previous fese@xmath21 single crystals are strongly disordered , as indicated by large residual resistivity @xmath23 and small residual resistivity ratio @xmath24 , typically 0.1 m@xmath25 cm and @xmath175 , respectively @xcite . </S>"
