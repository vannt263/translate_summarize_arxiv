    "the ratio between the two , the beam solid angle , is determined at least in part by source geometry and may differ widely from source to source ( e.g. , a thin accretion disk beaming into a plane ; a thick fragmented disk beaming emisson into a squat cylinder ; a foreground cloud amplifies jet emission along a pencil beam ) .",
    "consequently , correlations between various quantities and apparent maser luminosity may be anticipated to exhibit substantial scatter ( e.g. , l@xmath23 vs. l(2 - 10 kev ) , kondratko  2006b ; l@xmath23 vs. x - ray absoprtion column density , zhang 2006 ) .",

    "all `` high - velocity '' maser systems that have been studied thus far with very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) trace highly inclined accretion disks or disk - structures whose rotation curves suggest central dynamical masses of @xmath5 to @xmath6m@xmath7 .",
    "these include ngc4258 ( miyoshi  1995 ) , ngc1068 ( greenhill & gwinn 1997 ) , circinus ( greenhill  2003a ) , ngc3079 ( trotter  1998 ; yamauchi  2004 ; kondratko  2004 ) , ngc3393 ( kondratko  2007 ) , ic2560 ( ishihara  2001 ; greenhill  in prep . ) , and ngc6323 and ugc3789 ( braatz , this volume ) .",

    "this also marks disks . * * low - luminosity  * apparent luminosities @xmath30l@xmath7 .",
    "low luminosity often appears to be associated with maser action driven by star formation .",
    "for instance , lacking high - velocity emission , the ngc2639 maser classification would be `` ambiguous '' but for observed secular drift that suggests the maser emission originates in a disk ( wilson  1995 ) .",
    "the ngc1068 maser exhibits chiefly plateau emission , but symmetry in maximum velocity offsets of @xmath31kms@xmath27 is a directy attributable to origin in a disk ( greenhill & gwinn 1997 ) .",
    "lastly , the m82 maser spectrum exhibits just a few doppler components near v@xmath32 , but low apparent luminosity suggests origin in star formation ( ho 1987 ) , as confirmed by direct imaging ( hagiwara 2007 ) .",
    "these are `` static '' examples .",
    "in contrast , spectra may develop defining characteristics due to natural source variability ; an `` ambiguous '' maser with no high - velocity emission at one epoch may display symmetric high - velocity emission at a later epoch ( e.g. , ngc3735 , kondratko et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "such cases reinforce the importance of monitoring in spectroscopic studies .",
    "water maser emission traces underlying dense , warm gas .",
    "the details of amplification in any individual parcel of gas may be difficult to quantify , but nonetheless each observable maser spot samples line - of - sight velocity on the sky , marks the sky position of a stationary point along the line of sight in the line - of - sight velocity field , and points to volumes where energy is deposited into the molecular gas .",
    "necessarily , sampling is incomplete because maser emission is beamed ( i.e. , any one observer will see only a fraction of masers in a given source ) .",
    "however , inferences from the distribution of maser positions and velocities , coupled with _ a priori _ constraints on geometry ( e.g. , largely planar , point - symmetric , rotating structures , with circular or nearly circular orbits ) , enable construction of robust models and meaningful 3d deprojections .    for a nearly edge - on ,",
    "differentially rotating , well ordered , thin ( @xmath33 ) , flat disk that is heated by irradiation broadly across its surface or internally via viscous dissipation , velocity coherence favors h@xmath0o maser emission : ( 1 ) in a narrow sector on the near / far side , and ( 2 ) close to the disk - diameter perpendicular to the line of sight ( the `` midline '' ) .",
    "the former gives rise to spectral features near the systemic velocity ( figure2 ) .",
    "the latter gives rise to high - velocity emission that traces the rotation curve of the disk when mapped with interferometers .",
    "ngc4258 is the archetype in this respect ( herrnstein  2005 ; moran , this volume ) .",
    "emission loci for thick disks ( @xmath34 ) are comparatively difficult to predict .",
    "ngc3079 is a good example ( kondratko  2004 ) .",
    "red and blue - shifted emission are segregated on opposite sides of the central engine , but otherwise the maser structure is clumped with local velocity dispersions @xmath35% of the rotation speed . between the two extremes",
    "are the relatively well - ordered mid - range cases of circinus , which is somewhat clumpy but keplerian to within modeling errors ( greenhill  2003b ) , and ngc1068 , which is moderately clumpy and distinctly sub - keplerian ( greenhill & gwinn 1997 ; lodato & bertin 2003 ) .",
    "warps also complicate prediction of emission loci .",
    "maser photons are beamed close to disk planes , ( probably ) with narrower beam angles for thinner disks .",
    "warps broaden the solid angle into which emission is beamed but and separate the loci where line - of - sight velocity is coherent and where the disk is seen edge - on . despite variation of @xmath200.1rad in euler angles over a 2:1 range of radius , the high - velocity emission loci in ngc4258 are dictated by velocity coherence rather than local tangency of the line of sight to the disk .",
    "this could be attributed to finite disk thickness , where in the limiting case of a paper - thin disk , the reverse would be true .",
    "o masers in agn .",
    "water masers are quite often beacons of activity in galactic nuclei",
    ". related science impacts studies of agn physics and refinement of the extragalactic distance scale , with ramifications for estimation of cosmological parameters . ]",
    "key science directly enabled by study of disk masers follows two principal threads ( figure  4 ) : study of agn structure ( e.g. , morganti  2004 ) and `` maser cosmology , '' i.e. , characterization of cosmological parameters via estimation of accurate geometric distances to maser host galaxies ( greenhill 2004 ; also braatz , this volume ) .",
    "notably , the latter depends on the former in that estimation of distances requires clean 3d dynamical models of maser disks , obtained via fitting to maser positions and line - of - sight velocities .",
    "* agn structure * very long baseline study of disk masers is the only means by which structures @xmath36pc from massive black holes can be directly mapped . a 1pc diameter annulus of maser emission at a distance of 100mpc subtends on the order of 10 interferometer beams ; a maser that is 2000  across can be resolved into at least as many spectral channels with vlb correlators .",
    "mapping disks in type-2 agn can be particularly valuable because obscuration complicates spectroscopic and timing analyses of central engines at other wavebands , and high inclinations superpose reflected , scattered , and partially obscured emission from the central engines and surrounding media with a range of temperatures .",
    "_ effectively , the agn that are the most difficult to study with existing instruments at other wavebands are amenable to detailed radio study when maser emission is present .",
    "_ the contrast is perhaps strongest for agn with compton thick obscuration , for which disk masers have a strong preference ( figure5 ) .",
    "modeling vlb data in principal enables accurate measurement of central engine dynamical masses , disk masses , eddington luminosities , and descriptive ratios such as l@xmath37/l@xmath38 .",
    "dynamical masses may be used to refine m@xmath39 and m@xmath40 relations ( e.g. , ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; ferrarese  2006 ) that address the question : what are the roles of massive black holes in galaxy formation ? as well , detailed maps of disk structure may be used to assess the balance among central engine gravity , disk self - gravity , luminosity , and dissipation ( e.g. , tilak 2008 ) .",
    "independent estimation of disk systemic velocities is also possible , enabling refinement of galactic systemic velocities , or estimation of central engine drift ( cf .",
    "reid & brunthaler 2004 ) . in the case of warped disks",
    ", orientations are known to change by 0.1 - 1rad over radii of 0.1 - 1pc .",
    "misalignment between central engine principle axes and reservoirs of accreting material on parsec and larger scales can be significant ( e.g. , ngc3079 ; kondratko  2004 ) .",
    "quantitative characterization of warps enables assessment of torque origins and disk stability ( e.g. , maloney  1996 ) .",
    "this also enables assessment of warped disks as the origin of obscuring columns in at least some , with ramifications for the unification paradigm .",
    "the suggestion is borne out for ngc4258 ( fruscione  2005 ; herrnstein  2005 ) , and circumstantial evidence for circinus supports the hypothesis that shadowing by warps may in some cases bound outflows and photoionized regions ( greenhill  2003a ) .",
    "the standard model is flat and comprises radiation , baryonic matter , nonbaryonic matter , and dark energy .",
    "it has been defined largely by analyses of cosmic microwave background fluctuations and supernova distances ( e.g. , spergel  2007 ) .",
    "nevertheless , estimates of geometry and the physical nature of dark energy remain too uncertain to distinguish among contending theories without substantive assumptions ; external constraints are required , as from s - z effect or lensing .",
    "high - accuracy measurement of the hubble constant , @xmath41 , would be another and arguably a more direct one .",
    "accuracy of @xmath201% would enable strong constraint on the dark energy equation of state ( hu 2005 ; macri  2006 ) .",
    "the present best independent estimate of @xmath41 is perhaps accurate to 10% , though systematic errors are difficult to quantify ( argon  2007 ) .",
    "a sample of a few to a few tens of anchor galaxies with measured geometric distances could support direct estimation of h@xmath1 , probably with higher accuracy than is possible with traditional standard candles , considering intrinsic and systematic uncertainties .",
    "all distance estimates for @xmath42 anchors being equally good , uncertainties in @xmath41 would scale as @xmath43 because systematic uncertainties for disk models among galaxies depend chiefly on individual emission distributions and are uncorrelated .",
    "in fact , focus on a few very good cases , e.g. , ngc4258-like galaxies in the hubble flow , might yield better results overall than a larger sample of more middling cases , though the distribution in @xmath44 matters .    in principal",
    ", two geometric distance estimates may be obtained for each maser galaxy , one via analysis of centripetal acceleration , and one via analysis of proper motion ( herrnstein  1999 ) .",
    "both observables are greatest for masers close to the systemic velocity .",
    "measurement of acceleration is easier and less resource intensive .",
    "( proper motions are a very small fraction of a beamwidth for earth - bound baselines ; 1000  subtends @xmath20@xmath45asyr@xmath27 at @xmath20100mpc , or @xmath201% of a beam at @xmath46 cm .",
    "for an orbital radius of 1pc , this speed corresponds to a @xmath201kms@xmath27yr@xmath27 drift or about one line width per year . )",
    "nonetheless , vlb study is requisite to establish a disk rotation curve and model from which to estimate central mass divided by distance and deprojected orbital radii for systemic emission .",
    "the latter are distinct from the radii of high - velocity emission inferred from rotation curves and in first order analyses may be inferred from the rate of change of line - of - sight velocity as a function of position along the disk plane .    the basic methodology to measure the geometric distance to an anchor galaxy involves several vlb epochs , coupled with single - dish monitoring of spectra over a time interval that includes the vlb observations ( to enable cross - referencing ) . considering time variability of doppler components over weeks to months ,",
    "vlb epochs need to be closely spaced in time ( in the event more than one is required to achieve adequate sensitivity ) . however , widely spaced clusters of vlb epochs are also useful in cases where the velocity pattern of doppler components evolves ( i.e. , new lines appearing at new velocities ) .",
    "repeated vlb observation may broaden the fraction of the disk that can be traced ( e.g. , by sampling the midline over a larger range of radii ) , thus improving model quality .      * red _ and _ blue - shifted high - velocity emission  * emission close to the systemic velocity  * thin disk structure  * peculiar motion that is small with respect to total recessional velocity  * a line strong enough for vlb self - calibration _ or _ a strong calibrator @xmath47 away .",
