    "realizing the promising applications in physics , magnetochemistry and biomedicine , molecular magnets have recently been the focal point of intense subject of research .",
    "although these materials appear as macroscopic objects , i.e. , crystals or powders , the intramolecular magnetic interactions are utterly negligible as compared to the intramolecular interaction .",
    "thus their magnetic properties mainly reflect the ensemble properties of small clusters .",
    "it appears that in majority of these molecules , the localized single particle magnetic moments couple antiferromagnetically and the spectrum is rather well described by the heisenberg model with isotropic nearest neighbor interaction , sometimes augmented by anisotropic terms and dipolar interactions  @xcite .",
    "thus , the interest in the heisenberg model , which is known for a long time , is renewed recently by the successful synthesis of new magnetic clusters and magnetic molecules .",
    "_ ab initio _ studies show that often these magnetic systems are frustrated due to the competing magnetic interactions between the individual magnetic moments .",
    "the effect of finite sizes , quantum fluctuations and frustrations can have dramatic consequences on the energy spectra and can even give rise to new phases apart from the conventional n@xmath4el - like order  @xcite .",
    "a great deal of effort has been devoted to the theoretical studies on magnetic clusters using different theoretical techniques to solve the heisenberg model  @xcite .    using exact diagonalization of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model , konstantinidis _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have calculated the ground state magnetization for a dodecahedron and icosahedron symmetry for @xmath5 = 1/2 and 1 and have obtained discontinuity in the field - dependent magnetization and double peaks in the temperature - dependent specific heat arising due to frustrations . using perturbation theory , coffey _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have studied the effect of frustration and connectivity on the magnetic properties of a 60-site cluster .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have applied an approximation of diagonalization scheme to a cuboctahedron for @xmath5 = 1 and 3/2 in order to obtain the energy spectra .",
    "in addition to the magnetic properties , several studies exist for the thermodynamic properties of clusters .",
    "for example , honecker _",
    "_  @xcite have calculated several magneto - thermal properties such as the magnetic susceptibility , specific heat and magnetic cooling rate for a cuboctahedron with different spin quantum numbers using the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model . besides the exact diagonalization method , several other techniques such as the density matrix renormalization group  @xcite , cluster expansions  @xcite , spin - wave expansions  @xcite and quantum monte carlo techniques  @xcite can be used to study the magnetic systems . however , some of these techniques have drawbacks , for example , quantum monte carlo technique has limitations in describing the systems with geometric frustration .",
    "the advantage of exact diagonalization method relative to these approximate methods is that one obtains all informations about the whole energy spectra such as the degeneracy , the lowest eigenenergies and eigenfunctions from which the ground state as well as finite temperature properties can be calculated .    in the present work",
    "we have applied the exact diagonalization method to calculate the properties of clusters with spin-1/2 and 1 .",
    "we have studied the magnetic and thermodynamic properties of small clusters with the focus on showing the effect of dipolar interaction and uniaxial anisotropy on the magnetization behavior in the presence of magnetic field , the studies of which are still limited in literature  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the temperature - dependent as well as the ground state spin - spin correlation functions are calculated for these clusters and are compared with respect to the classical case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sectionii , we describe the theoretical method used for modeling the quantum clusters .",
    "sectioniii discusses the results obtained for 13-atom clusters with spin-1/2 , including the effect of dipolar interaction .",
    "then , sectioniv describes the findings for 4-atom clusters with spin-1 , where the effect of uniaxial anisotropies and temperature - dependent correlation functions has been discussed , and sectionv discusses the results for spin-1 icosahedron in the presence of local uniaxial anisotropies . in sectionvi the results are summarized .",
    "from first - principles calculations it turns out  @xcite that the interaction between electrons may be well represented by a model hamiltonian describing a set of interacting spins @xmath6 . an important class of such interacting spin models consists of spins coupled bilinearly on a finite lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian of such a system can be expressed by heisenberg hamiltonian , @xmath7 where in general the sum runs over all pairs .",
    "@xmath8 is the spin operator on site @xmath9 having total spin @xmath5 and @xmath10 component of the spin @xmath11 can take values @xmath12 ; @xmath13 is the exchange interaction .",
    "this model describes the ferromagnetic ( antiferromagnetic ) heisenberg model when @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) . in one dimension and for only nearest - neighbor couplings",
    "@xmath16 , the @xmath5=1/2 heisenberg model has been solved analytically by means of the bethe _ ansatz _  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the use of the bethe _ ansatz _ is quite limited , as this method is only applicable to models in one dimension . for higher dimensions ,",
    "one has to look for approximate methods . when the number of spins in the system is small enough",
    ", one can solve the problem by employing exact diagonalization techniques  @xcite . a straightforward way to study the model hamiltonian , defined in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : eq1 ] ) , numerically is simply to obtain the matrix elements of @xmath17 in a basis of @xmath18 , with the @xmath10-axis taken as quantization direction , where @xmath19 is the total number of spins in the system , and then diagonalize the hamiltonian matrix numerically .",
    "the hamiltonian matrix can be decomposed into block structure with the use of symmetries of the model .",
    "since the isotropic heisenberg model includes only the scalar product between the spins , the hamiltonian is rotationally invariant in spin space , i.e. , it commutes with the square of the total spin of the system , @xmath20 and the @xmath10 component of the total spin , @xmath21 . even though it is straightforward to work in a @xmath22 subspace",
    ", there is no simple method to construct symmetry adopted eigenstates of @xmath23 .",
    "construction of symmetry adopted eigenstates of @xmath23 requires more involved calculations  @xcite . additionally , the hamiltonian is symmetric under permutations of spins that respect the connectivity of our small sized cluster , and the model possesses time reversal symmetry in the absence of external magnetic fields .",
    "when we take into account the symmetries in the system , the @xmath22 basis states can be projected onto states that transform under specific irreducible representation of the symmetry group . in this way , the hamiltonian is block diagonalized into smaller matrices and the maximum dimension required for numerical diagonalization is considerably reduced compared to full hilbert space size .    in the presence of an external magnetic field , dipolar interaction and",
    "anisotropy the heisenberg hamiltonian ( [ eqn : eq1 ] ) is modified to @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the homogeneous external magnetic field defining , without loss of generality , the @xmath10-direction . here",
    "it may be noted that the factor @xmath26 is absorbed into @xmath25 and @xmath10 component of the the total spin , @xmath27 , can take values from @xmath28 to @xmath29 in unit steps , where @xmath29 is the maximum total spin of the system .",
    "the dipolar term @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : eq2 ] ) is defined as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the unit vector along the line connecting the two spins or dipoles located on the sites @xmath9 and @xmath33 , and the sum runs over all pairs .",

    "( [ eqn : eq2 ] ) represents the local uniaxial anisotropy , which is defined by @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the local uniaxial anisotropy constants and @xmath37 is the unit vector giving the radial direction from the central spin .",
    "since the commutators , @xmath38 \\ne 0 $ ] and @xmath39 \\ne 0 $ ] , @xmath21 is no - more a good quantum number in presence of dipolar interaction @xmath30 or anisotropy term @xmath34 and therefore in presence of dipolar or anisotropy term the block diagonalization with respect to different @xmath21 values is not possible .",
    "now we construct the hamiltonian matrix in terms of eigenstates of the total @xmath22 operator and express the hamiltonian in terms of the raising and lowering operators @xmath40 .",
    "when @xmath41 and @xmath42 operates on the eigenstates of @xmath43 , we have @xmath44 for example , for a spin-1/2 particle , @xmath45 and for a spin-1 particle , @xmath46 where in the latter case @xmath47 denote the three possible values of @xmath48 . in the absence of @xmath30 and @xmath34 ,",
    "the @xmath10 component of the total spin is a conserved quantity and we can decompose the hamiltonian matrix into smaller blocks characterizing each values of the total spin .",
    "for example , in case of a 13-atom cluster with @xmath5 = 1/2 , the @xmath49 dimensional hamiltonian matrix is divided into blocks with dimension @xmath50 , with @xmath51 .",
    "14 such block matrices have to be diagonalized and the largest block matrix has @xmath52 rows .",
    "it may be noted that @xmath21 being the good quantum number , the zeeman term is not needed to be included in numerical diagonalization process and can be included later by shifting the eigenvalues by @xmath53 .",
    "however , these simplification is not possible when dipolar interaction or uniaxial anisotropy term is present in the hamiltonian .",
