    "recent years have seen a marked increase in the study , both theoretical and observational , of the epoch in the history of our universe after the cosmological recombination era : from the so called _ ` dark ages ' _ to the _ epoch of reionization _ ( eor ) @xcite .",
    "a cold and dark universe , after the recombination era , was illuminated by sources of radiation , be it stars , quasars or dark matter annihilation .",
    "these ` first objects ' ionized and heated their surrounding inter - galactic medium ( igm ) , carving out ` bubbles ' in the otherwise neutral hydrogen - filled universe .",
    "these bubbles grew rapidly , both in size and number , and caused a phase transition in the hydrogen - ionized fraction of our universe at redshifts 6@xmath0@xmath1@xmath020 @xcite .",
    "although the eor spanned a relatively small fraction , in time , of the universe s age , its impact on subsequent structure formation ( at least baryonic ) is crucial .",
    "hence , studying the eor directly influences our understanding of issues in contemporary astrophysical research such as metal - poor stars , early galaxy formation , quasars and cosmology @xcite . for a detailed review of the eor and our current efforts to detect it ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and the references therein .",
    "given the recent progress in developing a concrete theoretical framework , and simulations based thereon , the eor from an observational point of view is still very poorly constrained . despite a wealth of observational cosmological data made available during the past years ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , data directly probing the eor have eluded scientists and the ones that constrain the eor are indirect and very model - dependent @xcite .",
    "currently there are two main observational constraints on the eor : first , the sudden jump in the lyman-@xmath2 optical depth in the gunn ",
    "peterson troughs @xcite , observed in the quasar spectra of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ( becker et al .",
    "2001 ; fan et al .",
    "2001 ; pentericci et al .",
    "2002 ; white et al.q 2003 ; fan et al .",
    "2006 ) which provides a limit on when reionization was completed .",
    "current consensus is that reionization ended around a redshift of six .",
    "second , the five - year _ wmap _ data on the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) ( spergel et al . 2007 ; page et al . 2007 ) which gives an integral constraint on the thomson optical depth for scattering experienced by the cmb photons since the eor . a maximum likelihood analysis performed by @xcite estimates the peak of reionization to have occured at 11.3 when the cosmic age was 365 myr .",
    "thus , we see that current astronomical data is only able to provide us with crude boundaries within which reionization occured . in order to properly characterize the onset , evolution and completion of the eor and derive results on its impact on subsequent evolution of structures in the universe , we need more direct measurements from the eor .",
    "[ fig : layout][fig : hba_tile ]    observations of the hydrogen 21-cm hyperfine `` spin - flip '' transition , using radio interferometry , provide just such a direct probe of the dark ages and the eor over a wide spatial and redshift range .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the `` spatial range '' here implies the two dimensions on the sky , which is a function of the baseline lengths of an interferometer , and the third dimension along the redshift direction , which depends on the frequency resolution of the observation . the 21-cm emission line from the eor is redshifted by @xmath3 , because of the expansion of the universe , to wavelengths in the meter waveband .",
    "for example , at a redshift of @xmath4 the 21-cm line is redshifted to 2.1 metres , which corresponds to a frequency of about 140  mhz .",
    "computer simulations suggest that we may expect a complex , evolving patch - work of neutral ( h@xmath5 ) and ionized hydrogen ( h@xmath6 ) regions . if we manage to successfully image the universe at these high redshifts ( @xmath7 ) we expect to find h@xmath6 regions , created by ionizing radiation from first objects , to appear as `` holes '' in an otherwise neutral hydrogen - filled universe ; the so - called _ swiss - cheese model_. current constraints and simulations converge on reionization happening for a large part in the redshift range @xmath8 ( @xmath9115  mhz ) to @xmath10 ( @xmath9203  mhz ) , which is the range probed by lofar , a radio interferometer currently being built near the village of exloo in the netherlands .",
    "the 21-cm radiation can not only trace the matter power spectrum in the period after recombination , but also can constrain reionization scenarios @xcite .",
    "note that because strongly radiating sources create bubbles of ionized gas inside the neutral igm , one should observe fluctuations in the 21-cm emission due to reionization that deviate from those of neutral gas tracing the dark - matter distribution , even deep into the highly linear regime .",
    "developments in radio - wave sensor technologies in recent years have enabled us to conceive of and design extremely large , high sensitivity and high resolution radio interferometers , a development which is essential to conduct a successful 21-cm experiment to image the eor .",
    "a series of radio telescopes are being built similar to lofar , such as mwa , paper , 21cma and further in the future the ska , all with one of their primary goals being the detection of the redshifted 21-cm signal from the eor .",
    "the gmrt has a programme already under way to detect the eor or at least to constrain the foregrounds that may hamper the experiment @xcite .",
    "calculations predict the cosmological 21-cm signal from the eor to be extremely faint .",
    "apart from the intrinsic low strength of the 21-cm signal , the experiment is plagued by a myriad of signal contaminants like man - made and natural ( e.g. lightnings ) interference , ionospheric distortions , galactic free - free and synchrotron radiation , clusters and radio galaxies along the path of the signal .",
    "thus long integration times , exquisite calibration and well - designed rfi mitigation techniques are needed in order to ensure the detection of the underlying signal .",
    "it is also imperative to properly model all these effects beforehand , in order to develop sophisticated schemes that will be needed to clean the data cubes from these contaminants @xcite . due to the low signal - to - noise ratio per resolution element ( of the order of 0.2 or for lofar and and even less for e.g. mwa ) , the initial aim of all current experiments is to obtain a statistical detection of the signal . by statistical , we mean a global change in a property of the signal , for example the variance , as a function of frequency and angular scale .",
    "note that this task involves distinguishing these statistical properties from those of the calibration residuals and the thermal noise .",
    "in addition to the above - mentioned astrophysical and terrestrial sources of contamination , one also has to face issues arising in standard synthesis imaging . for",
    "that it is crucial to describe all physical effects on the signal that determine the values of the measured visibilities .",
    "the study of polarized radiation falls within the regime of optics : @xcite provided such a unifying model for the jones and mueller calculi in optics @xcite and the techniques of radio interferometry based on multiplying correlators .",
    "because low frequency phased - array dipole antennas are inherently polarized , one has to consider polarimetry from the beginning .",
    "the measurement equation ( me ) of @xcite is therefore a natural way to describe lofar .",
    "their treatment @xcite forms the basis of our data model description and we will present it in a wider setting , giving the connection to physics .",
    "the hamaker  bregman ",
    "sault measurement equation acts on the astronomical signals as a `` black - box '' : the interferometer converts the input signal stokes vectors to the final output at the correlator .",
    "this is done via a sequence of linear transformations and thus enables us to systematically model the series of effects that modify the signal while it propagates through the ionosphere and the receivers .",
    "calibration @xcite of the observed visibility data set is generally aimed at determining instrumental parameters of the antennas at a level sufficient to detect signals at several times the noise level .",
    "while this is the traditional approach , a much more thorough understanding of the instrumental response is required in currently designed experiments such as the lofar eor key - science project , where unprecedented high dynamic range and sensitivity have to be achieved , and the signal is far below the noise level .",
    "for example , the clean algorithm and variations on it have been used extensively , as an integral part of the selfcal process @xcite .",
    "while computationally efficient , it does not provide a statistically optimal solution @xcite .",
    "in this work we shall therefore consider a maximum - likelihood solution to the measurement equation inversion problem @xcite , which takes into account realistic zero - mean calibration residuals and noise .",
    "we are also examining alternative solutions @xcite , however .    after giving a short description of the lofar array , with emphasis on the high band ( hba ) aspects of the design in section 2 , we review the basic relation between the observed visibilities and the sky intensity in section 3 .",
    "we emphasize the polarized , matrix formulation of the measurement equation and the mathematical aspects of coherency matrix @xcite . in section 4",
    "we briefly discuss the relevant measurement equation ( me ) parameters for lofar . using this measurement equation as our data model ,",
    "in section 5 , we produce a number of simulations for different instrumental parameters .",
    "this is the forward use of the data model .",
    "we also try to invert the data model , given the instrumental parameters and their error distributions , in order to recover the original data .",
    "our goal is to test the calibration and inversion requirements using realistically generated data cubes . in section 6",
    "we discuss the results and give our conclusions .",
    "the immediate science goals of the lofar eor - ksp , that drive some of the considerations about the design of lofar @xcite , are : ( 1 ) extract the 21-cm neutral hydrogen signal averaged along lines of sight , i.e.  the ` global signal ' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ( 2 ) determine the spatial - frequency power spectrum of the brightness temperature fluctuations on angular scales of about 1 arcminute to 1 degree and frequency scales between 0.1 and 10 mhz in the redshift range of @xmath96 - 11 and ( 3 ) search for strmgren ionization bubbles around bright sources and the 21-cm absorption - line forest @xcite . in order to achieve these science goals , lofar requires a good uv - coverage , a good frequency coverage and a large collecting area .",
    "below , we give a short summary of the aspects of lofar which are relevant to the eor experiment and our data model . for more details",
    "we refer to the project paper by de bruyn et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "in its current layout , the lofar telescope @xcite will consist of up to 48 stations of which approximately 24 will be located in the core region ( figure  [ fig : layout ] ) , near the village of exloo in the netherlands .",
    "the core marks an area of 1.7 by 2.3 kilometres .",
    "each high band antenna station ( hba station ; 110240 mhz ; see next section ) in the core is further split into two `` half - stations '' of half the collecting area ( @xmath931 metre diameter ) , separated by @xmath9130  metres .",
    "this split further improves the uv - coverage , though at the cost of quadrupling the bluegene / p correlator demands ( i.e. there are four times more base - lines ) .",
    "the central region of the core consists of six closely - packed stations , `` the six - pack '' , to ensure improved coverage of the shortest baselines necessary to map out the largest scales on the sky , such as the milky way .",
    "the station - layout yields a snapshot uv - coverage at the zenith as shown in figure  [ fig : layout ] .",
    "the uv - coverages for a typical synthesis time of 4 hrs are shown in figure  [ fig : plot9x9 ] .",
    "a good uv - coverage is crucial for several reasons . first to improve sampling of the power spectrum of the eor signal @xcite .",
    "second , to obtain precise local @xcite and global @xcite sky models ( lsm / gsm ; i.e.  catalogues of the brightest , mostly compact , sources in and outside of the beam , i.e. local versus global ) .",
    "a further complication is the extraction of the galactic and extragalactic foregrounds .",
    "this is a vital step in the recovery of the signal and requires good sampling of the uv - plane at all frequencies @xcite .",
    "lofar will have two sets of dipoles , the low band antennas ( lba ) and the high band antennas ( hba ) .",
    "for the eor experiment we are mostly interested in the hba dipoles which cover the 110 to 220 mhz frequency range .",
    "each dipole is a crossed dipole which enables x and y polarization observations . inside the station",
    "the dipoles are arranged in tiles of 4 by 4 dipoles , with 24 tiles per station inside the core ( figure  [ fig : layout ] ) .",
    "radio waves are sampled with a 16-bit analog - to - digital converter to be able to cope with expected interference levels operating at either 160 or 200 mhz in the first , second or third nyquist zone ( i.e. , 0100 , 100200 , or 200300 mhz band respectively for 200 mhz sampling ) .",
    "the data from the receptors are filtered in 512 , 195 khz sub - bands ( 156 khz sub - bands for 160 mhz sampling ) of which a total of 32 mhz bandwidth ( 164 channels ) can be used at one time .",
    "sub - bands from all antennas are combined at the station level in a digital beamformer allowing multiple ( 46 ) independently steerable beams , which are sent to the central processor via a glass - fibre link that handles 0.7 tbit / s data .",
    "the beams from all stations are further filtered into 1 khz channels , cross - correlated and integrated .",
    "the integrated visibilities are then calibrated on 1 second intervals , to correct for the effects of the ionosphere , and subsequently images are produced .",
    "channels with disturbing radio frequency interference ( rfi ) are excised @xcite .",
    "for the correlation we use three racks of an ibm blue gene / p machine in groningen with a total of 12288 processing cores .",
    "lofar is a new concept in array design , a broad - band aperture array with digital beamforming .",
    "this makes lofar essentially qualify as a pathfinder for the square kilometre array @xcite .",
    "the most important part of any physical measurement is to find a correspondence between the physical quantities and the measured quantities . in radio interferometry",
    "this is achieved through the so called measurement equations @xcite .",
    "the measurement equation ( me ) describes the relationship between the visibilities ( correlations between the electric fields from different antennas ) and the brightness distribution of the sky .",
    "we will begin by discussing briefly the different types of measurement equations and the implications for lofar @xcite . the data model presented in this paper",
    "can be easily applied to other telescopes that operate at low frequencies such as the mwa and eventually the ska .",
    "astronomical radio signals appear as spatially wide - band random noise with superimposed features , such as polarization , emission and absorption lines .",
    "the physical quantity that underlies this kind of measurement is the electric field , but for convenience astronomers try to recover the intensity in the direction of the unit pointing vector * s * , @xmath11 .",
    "the measured correlation of the electric fields between two sensors @xmath12 and @xmath13 is called the complex visibility . for earth - rotation synthesis",
    "we assume that the telescopes have a small field of view ( fov ) and that they track a position on the sky . to achieve that , a slowly time - varying phase delay has to be introduced at the receiver to compensate for the geometrical delays .",
    "the result is that the reference location appears to be at the zenith , or their chosen point in the sky ( phase reference center ) . for a planar array",
    ", the receiver baselines can be parametrized as @xmath14,\\phantom{dsdsf}\\lambda\\equiv\\dfrac{c}{2\\pi \\nu}.   \\label{def}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 are the station position vectors .",
    "this system is wavelength dependent .",
    "the ( scalar ) measurement equation in @xmath16 coordinates becomes @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the complex primary beam or antenna response pattern and @xmath19 is the sky brightness distribution . this equation ( van cittert ",
    "zernike theorem ) is in the form of a 2d fourier transform , which is an approximation for a flat sky @xcite .",
    "the visibilities are sampled for all different sensor pairs @xmath12 and @xmath13 , but also for different sensor locations projected on the sky , since the earth rotates .",
    "hence earth - rotation synthesis traces uv tracks for each baseline @xcite .",
    "the most widely used me is still the scalar formulation of the me .",
    "we begin the discussion with the scalar me and later we will also discuss the polarized version thereof . since all processing is done with digital computers this equation must be transformed into a more convenient discretized form .",
    "the main output of the lofar correlator is a set of correlation matrices @xcite , @xmath20 , for a set of narrow - band frequency channels ( adding up to 32 mhz bandwidth ) and for a set of short - time integrations ( adding up to @xmath21300 hours of integration ) .",
    "the connection between the correlation matrices @xmath22 and the visibilities @xmath23 is that each entry @xmath24 of @xmath22 is a sample of the visibility function for a specific coordinate @xmath16 corresponding to the baseline vector @xmath25 between telescopes @xmath12 and @xmath13 at time @xmath26 @xcite : @xmath27 the noiseless scalar measurement equation ( not accounting for instrumental and other distorting effects ) for one short - time integration and narrow - band frequency channel , assuming the sky can be described by a set of point- sources , can then be written in terms of the correlation matrices '' stands for the hermitian conjugation operator ] as @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 }   \\\\    ~\\\\     { { \\bf{a}}_{k , f } ( { \\bf{s}}_i ) = \\left [ { \\begin{array}{*{20}c }     { e^ { - i\\left ( { u_{1k } l + v_{1k } m } \\right ) } }   \\\\      \\vdots    \\\\     { e^ { - i\\left ( { u_{n_{\\rm tel } k } l + v_{n_{\\rm tel } k } m } \\right ) } }   \\\\ \\end{array } } \\right ] }   \\\\ ~\\\\      { { \\bf{b}}_f   = \\left ( { \\begin{array}{*{20}c }      { b_f \\left ( { { \\bf{s}}_1 } \\right ) } & { } & { }   \\\\      { } &   \\ddots   & { }   \\\\      { } & { } & { b_f \\left ( { { \\bf{s}}_d } \\right ) }   \\\\      \\end{array } } \\right ) }   \\\\    \\end{array }   \\label{def}\\ ] ] and where @xmath30 is the time  ordered visibility number , @xmath31 is the source position vector on the celestial sphere and @xmath32 the observing frequency channel number .",
    "the vector functions @xmath33 are called array response vectors in array signal processing and they are frequency dependent , but also time dependent in this case due to the rotation of the earth @xcite .",
    "they describe the response of an interferometer to a source at direction @xmath34 ( see figure [ svector ] ) .",
    "the above formalism is trivial as long as the positions of the telescopes are well known . in reality",
    "though , the response of the array is not perfect : telescopes are not omni - directional antennas , but each one has its own properties ( i.e. complex beam - shape and gain etc . ) . in this case",
    "the array response vectors must be redefined as @xmath35},\\ ] ] where @xmath36 indicates a hadamard ( element - wise ) product .",
    "the source structure can also vary with frequency . finally , most of the received signal consists of additive noise .",
    "when the noise has zero mean and is independent among the antennas ( spatially white ) , then @xmath37 noise can be assumed to be gaussian in radio - interferometers , like lofar .",
    "we will assume this in the remainder of this paper , and might address non - gaussian @xcite time - varying noise in future publications .",
    "actually , system noise is slightly different at each receiver .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that noise is spatially white : the noise covariance matrix is diagonal .",
    "the equations above describe the relation of the visibilities to the total intensity of the source , i.e. the classical stokes @xmath38 .",
    "to take polarization into account , several modifications are required .",
    "the use of the polarization information is of great importance for several reasons .",
    "first , this information provides insight in the physical processes that might exist in the astronomical object of interest .",
    "second , modern telescopes like lofar are also inherently polarized .",
    "third , using more information enhances the result of the data reduction process .",
    "the study of polarized light is therefore becoming an increasingly important issue in astrophysics @xcite .",
    "many matricial models have been developed to study the polarization properties of light .",
    "a proper description of the polarization properties of light relies on the concept of the coherency matrix @xcite .",
    "this mathematical formalism holds for every band of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "a usual assumption is monochromatic light , but polychromatic light behaves as monochromatic for time intervals longer than the natural period and shorter than the coherence time @xcite .",
    "our mathematical model will be based on those introduced in radio - astronomy by @xcite .",
    "the effects of linear passive media on the propagated photons can be represented by linear transformations of the electric field variables .",
    "the nature of those effects , the spectral profile of the light and the chromatic and polarizing properties of the medium through which light passes , all affect the degree of mutual coherence . in general coherent interactions can be represented by the jones calculus @xcite , while incoherent interactions of polychromatic light require the mueller calculus @xcite , since the loss of coherence needs more parameters to be described .",
    "the two components of the electric field ( e.g. those received at two dipoles ) can be arranged as the components a 2@xmath391 complex vector : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the relative phase .",
    "this vector includes all information about the temporal evolution of the electric field . when the parameters have no time dependence this is called the _",
    "jones vector_. moreover , the coherency ( or polarization or density ) matrix of a light beam contains all the information about its polarization state .",
    "this hermitian @xmath42 matrix is defined as @xmath43 this is the coherency matrix of the perpendicular dipoles of a single lofar hba antenna .",
    "@xmath44 stands for the kronecker product and the brackets indicate averaging over time @xcite . the coherency matrix is a correlation matrix whose",
    "elements are the second moments of the signal . using the ergodic hypothesis",
    "the brackets can be considered as ensemble averaging .",
    "due to its statistical nature its eigenvalues ought to be non - negative .",
    "the normalized version of this matrix @xmath45 contains information about the population and coherencies of the polarization states @xcite .",
    "this object is the equivalent of the single brightness point in the scalar version of the theory .      above we discussed the statistical interpretation of the coherency matrix .",
    "now we can also introduce a geometrical description : the measurable quantities stokes @xmath38 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 arise as the coefficients of the projection of the coherency matrix onto a set of hermitian trace - orthogonal matrices , the generators of the unitary su(2 ) group plus the identity matrix ( see appendix a1 ) .",
    "parameters with direct physical meaning can be derived from the corresponding measurable quantities .",
    "the stokes parameters are usually arranged as a @xmath49 vector , @xmath50 an alternative notation , that will be derived in appendix a is the @xmath42 stokes matrix : @xmath51 which relates the measured coherency matrix quantities to the stokes parameters @xcite .",
    "an adequate method to describe a non - depolarizing system is the jones formalism .",
    "it represents the effects on the polarization properties of an em wave after the interaction with such a system . for passive , pure systems ,",
    "the electric field components of the light interacting with them is given by the corresponding jones matrix @xmath52 , @xmath53 as both the initial and final fields can fluctuate , it is useful to describe the properties of partially polarized light with the coherency matrix . thus , @xmath54 as we are dealing with interferometry , the two @xmath55 matrices can come from two different telescopes .",
    "the effects on the electric field vectors in the coherency matrix @xmath56 can be written as an operation of these jones matrices on the original unaffected coherency matrix @xmath57 .",
    "as we already mentioned , the coherency matrix can also be written as a four vector with @xmath58 .",
    "this vector is related to the stokes vector via @xcite @xmath59 the matrix has the following property @xmath60 . using the properties of the kronecker product",
    "we then find , in terms of stokes parameters , that @xmath61 where @xmath62 are the pauli matrices ( appendix a1 ) .",
    "a jones matrix can represent a physically realizable state as long as the transmittance condition ( gain or intensity transmittance ) holds ; that is , the ratio of the initial and final intensities must be @xmath63 .",
    "the reciprocity condition describes the effect when the output signal follows the path in the inverse order .",
    "for every proper jones matrix @xmath64 .",
    "this result does not hold when magneto - optic effects are present . in this case the mueller ",
    "jones matrices have to be used . if a jones matrix represents a physically realizable state the reciprocal matrix also represents a physical effect .",
    "lofar stations consist of tiles of 4@xmath394 crossed dipoles which allow for full stokes measurements .",
    "if we have @xmath65 stations each with two polarization degrees of freedom , then the @xmath66 electric fields can be stacked into a single vector and the correlation matrix can be generalized to the following form @xmath67 for a linear polarization basis .",
    "note that each element of @xmath68 , @xmath69 is not hermitian for @xmath70 , but @xmath71 , so that @xmath68 remains hermitian @xcite .",
    "here we have denoted explicitly the correlation from the x and y oriented dipoles .",
    "let @xmath72 be the position dependent polarization multiplication matrix .",
    "this is the array response matrix ( as it is termed in the language of communication theory ) or in the hamaker formalism the jones matrix .",
    "the array response vector must take into account the different physical and instrumental effects that affect the signal through its path from the source to the recorder , like ionospheric faraday rotation , parallactic offsets , the geometric delay and instrumental gains ( and leakages ) .",
    "these effects are represented by the jones matrices .",
    "so we can write the measurement equation in the form @xcite @xmath73 where the different effects @xmath74 in the array response vector must be introduced in the exact order in which they affect the signal .",
    "the index @xmath75 is the pixel number and the index @xmath76 represent antenas @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively the algebra of complex jones matrices is obviously non - commutative , i.e.  the ordering of the matrices matters .",
    "the physical meaning of this is that the results of the different effects on the incoming electromagnetic wave are not linear .      in this section",
    "we give a brief overview of the instrumental parameters ( jones matrices ) which are used for our data simulations , their importance , and which parameters we use and perturb .",

    ", one can either use a very high resolution map and then assume that each pixel is a point source , taking into account the linearity of the me over the brightness distribution , or one can find a proper representation of the sky distribution ( i.e. shapelets ) and use a carefully chosen gridding - convolution function on the uv - plane .",
    "image plane effects need to be computed locally , as they affect relatively small scales and thus , they have a small convolution footprint .",

    "this is done in order to preclude the introduction of spurious distortions on the simulated cosmological signal as well as to retain the high - resolution of the image - plane effect predictions .",
    "the sky brightness distribution can be split into patches in order to increase the speed of execution at the expense of additional phase  shifts ( i.e. a shift in @xmath155 , the phase center of the image , correponds to a phase shift of the fourier kernel ) . in that case",
    "each discrete fourier transform and each frequency channel is independent , which yields an embarrassingly parallel computational process .    in our matrix formulation",

    "we shall discuss this in more detail in the following subsection .",
    "in this section , we describe the different effects the instrument and ionosphere have on the observed visibilities .",
    "these can be split in three categories : image - plane effects , uv - plane effects and noise .",

    "we apply them directly on the images before taking into account the @xmath161 jones matrix .",
    "this is because they are direction - dependent gains or rotations of the coherency matrix .",
    "they transform each pixel on the maps in a different way . in the uv - plane",
    ", they enter as convolutions of the visibilities . for now , we ignore the parallactic angle @xmath162 jones matrix , because its terms should be known to very high precision a priori , and depend only on the rotation of the sky inside the station primary beam pattern .",
    "we only consider the beam pattern and the ionospheric faraday rotation and phase delays .",
    "we use the lofar hba dipole beam patterns , as well as the hba station patterns provided in an astron technical report , by yatawatta ( 2007 ) .",
    "they depend on the element geometry and the station layout .",
    "initial engineering results from brentjens , yatawatta and wijnholds ( unpublished ) indicate that they are stable over a time interval of @xmath98 hours .",
    "we normalize the response at the phase center to one .",
    "slight misalignment of the dipoles , being not precisely orthogonal , would lead to a different polarized beam pattern response . because we are not correlating each dipole pair independently , but we are actually doing aperture synthesis between entire stations , we do not have the information needed to correct this effect on a per dipole basis . in the simulations we assume that this effect is included in the errors of the relevant jones matrices .",
    "we therefore include the net effect in the errors of the complex beam pattern .",
    "the other two image - plane effects that we shall consider in this paper are the ionospheric phase and the faraday rotation .",
    "we assume that the ionosphere consists of a single layer at an altitude of 250  km above the ground .",
    "we assume a velocity with a mean of 200  @xmath163 and a variance of 10  @xmath163 .",
    "this is done in order to simulate the turbulent temporary motion of the traveling ionospheric disturbances ( tid ) .",
    "we use five directions with different velocities . in such case",

    "we simulated a larger patch , though , of 50@xmath167 square kilometers .",
    "the ionospheric phase - delay introduced would be @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the tec along the line of sight , @xmath170 is the speed of light and @xmath171 is the observing frequency @xcite .",
    "the form of the ionospheric delay jones matrix is then @xmath172 and the ionospheric faraday rotation is     @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the rotation measure @xcite . the rotation measure in si units",

    "this has thus far been lacking in many publications on this topic , which have all neglected calibration and uv - sampling issues , and clearly needs to be addressed beyond overly simplified assumptions before results from any of the currently planned projects can be believed .",
    "we have also shown that using the currently known or estimated instrument specifications and layout of lofar , the 21-cm eor signal can be recovered if the noise properties are known a priori ( although we have not yet tested whether the extraction of noise and eor signal separately is possible ) , and the calibration of the ionosphere and instrument can be carried out in an unbiased fashion to the level that wsrt and lofar test setups indicate is possible . in forthcoming papers we will address far more complex situations that include all possible foregrounds ( not only galactic ) and where calibration will be done using the simulated data themselves .",
    "this requires a considerable increase in our computational power and we are currently implementing our codes on gpus to achieve the required processing power .    in more detail",
    ", in this paper we initially started by providing a brief description of the physical connections behind the hamaker ",
    "sault formalism .",
    "this completes the picture established by @xcite .",
    "the connection to physics helps in better understanding new and old problems in radio - polarimetry and provides a new perspective .",
    "novel methods of calibration and image evaluation can be developed based on those principles and we indicated a few possibilities ( see appendix a ) .",
    "after describing the connection between the physics of the jones and mueller calculi and the data model for a generic radio interferometric array , we introduced the data model that is relevant for the lofar eor ksp .",
    "this description of the signal pathways was used to generate detailed , large - scale polarized instrumental response simulations for several instrumental parameters assuming simplified , but still realistic models for their values and errors .",
    "the high - resolution data produced by this simulation were generated in such a way that they resemble a typical lofar eor observation .",
    "we applied the same procedure , albeit simple , as described by @xcite to recover the cosmological signal , and as a first benchmark of the inversion method .",
    "the polynomial fit method @xcite gives a reasonable result , even in the presence of small errors in the calibration parameters .",
    "when including realistic instrumental noise and calibration errors , we can still recover the cosmological signal if the properties of instrumental noise are well known as a function of frequency . in order to obtain the frequency dependence of the noise , we used the true underlying sky distribution .",
    "in reality , one might not have this luxury .",
    "however , differencing of image or visibility values between narrow frequency channels could in principle deliver the noise properties of the instrument as function of frequency .    what has not been addressed in this paper , but will be in the follow - up paper , is the calibration process itself . the traditional self - calibration algorithm @xcite alternates between calibration and clean steps in order to find the optimal image , from a given visibility data set",
    "this is done by substracting simple models for the sky brighness distribution and correcting for the calibration solutions at every step .",
    "this , however , leads to a suboptimal solution and certainly can not deal easily with complex sky brightness structures @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the maximum likelihood method has traditionally been used in many disciplines in order to estimate the parameters of linear systems .",
    "it can address the calibration , ( after linearization ) , and deconvolution problems and in forthcoming papers we will further test this methodology , besides others [ e.g. expectation maximization ; @xcite ] .",
    "finally , there is the problem of the signal extraction itself .",
    "although done independently of the inversion process in this paper , we suspect it can possibly be done simultaneously with the inversion .",
    "this will also be addressed in forthcoming papers . here ,",
    "we have studied signal extraction through polynomial fitting , but matched filtering is another approach that we plan to take , and we suspect it might be a good complementary method . those algorithms might have to make some use of a priori assumptions , though , since the observational evidence for the cosmological signal is scarce to non - existent .",
    "a detailed analysis of the noise properties of the foreground - cleaned maps also still has to be carried out .",
    "this can be done in a monte carlo sense .",
    "this way one can study the asymptotic efficiency of the ml , using the observed information matrix .",
    "another consideration should be the correlation properties between the instrumental parameters , as well as the error propagation , since in principle their behaviour is highly non - linear .    despite a considerable increase in the complexity of large - scale eor simulations ( thomas et al .",
    "2008 ) , foregrounds models ( jelic et al . 2008 ) and the instrument model ( this paper )  necessary to process and understand the results from our forthcoming lofar eor ksp observations  with this paper we intend to provide a guide towards even more complex simulations , including all the effects that we mentioned above and thus far have avoided or implemented in a simplified manner .",
    "we conclude with the comment , learned from the current paper , that only by doing simulations and successful signal - recovery on a scale and complexity - level comparable to the real observations , can one convincingly show that ongoing experiments  be it lofar , mwa , or otherwise  are capable of extracting the redshifted 21-cm signal from data sets affected by noise , rfi , calibration errors and bright foregrounds .",

    "in this appendix we introduce several fundamental concepts in the description of polarized radiation .",
    "although not yet used in this paper , we feel that they are important to mention and will be used in forthcoming publications to guide us to a better understanding of complex calibration processes in radio interferometry .",
    "pauli matrices are well known and have been used for the analysis of partially polarized light @xcite .",
    "their major advantage is that they satisfy a set of properties that significantly reduce the complexity of calculations associated with the intensity .",
    "the identity plus the pauli matrices in two dimensions are defined as @xmath180 this set of @xmath42 linearly independent matrices constitute a basis for the vector space of @xmath42 hermitian matrices over the compex numbers . summarizing their properties , they are hermitian and they follow the commutation relations @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the levi - civita permutation symbol @xcite .",
    "these matrices are unitary and traceless except for the identity matrix .",
    "the linear expansion of the coherency matrix in this basis is @xmath183 with @xmath184 being the four stokes parameters : @xmath185 corresponding to the stokes @xmath38 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .      in the literature",
    "the stokes parameters are usually arranged as a @xmath49 vector , @xmath186 @xcite .",
    "an alternative notation would be to introduce a @xmath42 stokes matrix .",
    "@xmath187 in this case for pure states we have @xmath188 and in the case of unpolarized light @xmath189 .",
    "this is because for unpolarized light @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are zero and the matrix becomes @xmath38 multiplied by the identity matrix . since there is a factor of @xmath190 , the frobenius norm of the matrix has this factor squared .",
    "even if the source is not polarized one should observe the same signal in both orthogonal polarizations , as in this case both polarization states are equiprobable .",
    "this is an important fact for calibration .",
    "the x and y dipoles of the lofar hbas should measure the same signal , for unpolarized sources , and any fluctuations should be due to polarization calibration errors .",
    "in addition , the degree of polarization is defined as @xmath191 .",
    "we can also define the unit vector @xcite @xmath192 the stokes vector can be decomposed using those parameters in several ways .",
    "a trivial decomposition is between a polarized and unpolarized state . as radio receivers",
    "are intrinsically polarized , and in the case of lofar orthogonal , a spectral decomposition can express the stokes vector as a convex linear sum of two orthogonal pure states .",
    "this makes the relationship between the measured signals and the parameters describing the system more clear , since we have to deal with orthogonal states .",
    "the spectral decomposition of the coherency matrix is using its eigenvalue structure to decompose it into pure states , i.e.  eigenvectors .",
    "the spectral decomposition ( diagonalization ) of the coherency matrix is then equivalent to @xmath193 + \\frac{{1 - p } } { 2}\\left [ { \\begin{array}{*{20}c }     1   \\\\     { \\mathbf{-p}^{t } }   \\\\      of course , for a mixed state there are infinite combinations of independent states into which it can be decomposed , but it would be useful if the selection is such that it matches the characteristics of the system . the parameters @xmath194 and @xmath195 are invariant under unitary transformations ( changes of coordinate systems ) .",
    "they are directly related to the eigenvalues of @xmath196 .",
    "pure states are related to rank-1 polarization matrices , and mixed states to rank-2 .",
    "wolf showed that there always exist two orthogonal reference directions , such that the degree of coherence is maximized and coincides with @xmath195 .",
    "this is important because various random distributions correspond to unpolarized light .",
    "the measurement of the correlations of the stokes parameters allows us to distinguish between those different types of non - polarized light .      concluding with the quality criteria , the von neumann entropy can be applied to electromagnetic waves @xcite . in terms of the coherency matrix",
    "it is defined as @xmath197 .",
    "is a measure of the difference in the amount of information between pure and mixed states , both with same intensity .",
    "it can be expressed as a function of the eigenvalues of @xmath196 as @xmath198 $ ] .",
    "it is a decreasing monotonic , bounded function of @xmath195 @xcite .",
    "it attains its maximum value , @xmath199 , for non polarized light and its minimum , @xmath200 , for totally polarized light . using this entropy",
    "one can define the polarization temperature .",
    "depolarizing effects , such as the ionospheric faraday rotation , can be studied this way in order to detect spatial heterogeneity .",
    "for example , ionospheric tids should lead to an increase in the polarization entropy .",
    "this is a good scheme of ranking observations : if the polarization entropy differs between two maps , residual faraday rotation and leakage can be present .",
    "finally , for non - gaussian distributions of polarization states , higher order moments are needed and the stokes system is no longer adequate to describe the polarization states .",
    "the standard ( self)-calibration procedure for interferometric observation of polarized light aims at recovering the coherency matrix of the polarized radiation .",
    "given the statistical nature of the coherency matrix , we must emphasize the importance of parameters that give a measurement of their polarimetric purity .",
    "polarization entropy is a concept related to the impurities of the media through which radiation propagates , as it was defined above .",
    "it is useful for many purposes , especially when depolarization is a relevant subject .",
    "an increase in the polarization entropy signifies a decrease in the polarization purity .",
    "it is a direct way to access the quality of the data .",
    "ionospheric faraday rotation causes a depolarization with a certain frequency behavior .",
    "we would expect that the entropy would follow this behavior . in figure",
    "[ fig : entropy ] we show the polarization entropy for several lines of sight as a function of frequency in a simulated map .",
    "attention should be brought to the fact that is really hard to distinguish between faraday rotation and other depolarization effects .",
    "the transformations of the stokes vector lead to a system of differential equations @xcite . from the statistical interpretation of the coherency matrix",
    "we derive that the stokes @xmath38 parameter has to be positive and that @xmath201 , which means that there can be no more polarized light than the total light .",
    "this is a key concept in physics , namely the conservation of energy . extending this remark",
    ", we can define a minkowski space ( in the mathematical sense ) for the stokes 4-vectors .",
    "the norm in this space would be @xmath202 .",
    "positive values of the norm correspond to the time - like vectors of the special theory of relativity .",
    "light - like stokes vectors correspond to totally polarized states .",
    "the poincare sphere defines the light cone with the exception that the symmetric part of the cone does not have any special meaning .",
    "the jones vector transforms as usual under the lorentz group .",
    "the coherency matrix is defined through the kronecker product of two jones vectors and is a 2@xmath392 spinor of rank two .",
    "the stokes vector and the coherency matrix must be realizations of the same irreducible representation of the lorentz group , as they both have 4 independent components .",
    "the lorentz transformations form a 6 parameter group .",
    "the six generators are the 3 spatial rotation generators of o(3 ) @xmath203 and the lorentz boosts @xmath204 .",
    "the infinitesimal transformation of the stokes vector is @xmath205 where @xmath206 is a matrix that resembles the absorption matrix .",
    "this equation is the radiative transfer equation along the signal path .",
    "if one choses to exclude effects that intensify the radiation , this is the complete mathematical description of the effects in the signal path .",
    "the lorentz boosts describe polarizing effects , while the spatial rotations describe the faraday rotation .",
    "the relation between the initial and final stokes vector is a finite lorentz transformation . while it sounds straightforward it is not an easy task .",
    "the problem arises from the non commutativity of the generators .",
    "magnus has proposed a solution to this problem .",
    "we will discuss this soon .",
    "after having introduced the coherency matrix and the jones formalism we proceed a step further in the mathematical abstraction in order to unify all possible cases .",
    "we note that every system is equivalent to a parallel combination of pure systems , and any pure system to a combination of retarders and diattenuators . in @xcite",
    "the author proposes the use of the quaternion algebra to describe the jones matrices , or their @xmath207 covering group .",
    "quaternions , as any other space isomorphic to @xmath208 constitute a subalgebra of a clifford algebra .",
    "in particular , in three dimensions the clifford product is equivalent to spatial rotations .",
    "pure systems can still be described as lorentz transformations in this algebra . since algebraic manipulations become more clear , the computational requirements of problems involving partial polarization can be reduced .",
    "the clifford algebra of three - dimensional space @xmath209 represents the four dimensional minkowski space time .",
    "clifford algebras have been used extensively to describe polarization mode dispersion ( pmd ) in optical fibres @xcite . in that field",
    "they have to deal with a spatially inhomogeneous , birefringent medium ( the optical fibre ) , which resembles the effects caused by the ionosphere on the em waves that propagate through it .      in the case of polarization mode dispersion , which can occur due to ionospheric faraday rotation , transversal of the polarized source signal through a set of phase screens etc ,",
    "one is interested in recovering the original polarization state of the radiation .",
    "two possibly quasi - orthogonal modes , represented by the input frequency - independent and the output jones vectors , are related through a complex @xmath210 jones matrix . despite the fact that we might not have any prior knowledge about the structure of the medium through which radiation propagates , the frequency dependence of that effect contains useful information about that medium .",
    "for example the @xmath211 faraday rotation should leave a distinct imprint on the signal , which can help us distinguish it from other depolarizing effects . in the general case ,",
    "the coherency matrix is transformed as @xmath212 . an arbitrary jones matrix with determinant 1 , can be also expressed in terms of two vectors @xmath213 and @xmath214 according to @xmath215 , \\label{def}\\ ] ]   + where @xmath216 is the pauli spin vector .",
    "this is a jones matrix representation of the lorentz transformation in a clifford algebra . in the case of a frequency",
    "dependent effect , @xmath217 , the jones space operator can be decomposed into real and imaginary components as @xmath218 , \\hfill \\\\    { \\mathbf{\\tilde j}}_{\\mathbf{\\omega } } { \\mathbf{\\tilde j } } =   - \\frac{i } { 2}\\left [ { { \\mathbf{\\omega } } + i{\\mathbf{\\lambda } } } \\right ] , \\hfill \\\\",
    "\\end{gathered }   \\label{def}\\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath219 represents differentiation with respect to the frequency .",
    "a solution for @xmath55 can be obtained through the magnus expanion , which specifies @xmath220 , where the first two coefficients are given by @xmath221    the coefficients of the magnus expansion for @xmath222 , are related to those of lower order through recursion .",
    "taylor expanding the frequency derivatives of the jones matrix to third order gives us a way to directly evaluate the magnus coefficients . to the extent of our knowledge , the methods mentioned above have not been applied in the field of radio interferometry"

    "<S> a number of experiments are set to measure the 21-cm signal of neutral hydrogen from the epoch of reionization ( eor ) . </S>",
    "<S> the common denominator of these experiments are the large data sets produced , contaminated by various instrumental effects , ionospheric distortions , rfi and strong galactic and extragalactic foregrounds . in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> the first in a series , we present the _ data model _ that will be the basis of the signal analysis for the lofar ( low frequency array ) eor key science project ( lofar eor ksp ) . using this data model </S>",
    "<S> we simulate realistic visibility data sets over a wide frequency band , taking properly into account all currently known instrumental corruptions ( e.g. direction - dependent gains , complex gains , polarization effects , noise , etc ) . </S>",
    "<S> we then apply primary calibration errors to the data in a statistical sense , assuming that the calibration errors are random gaussian variates at a level consistent with our current knowledge based on observations with the lofar core . </S>",
    "<S> our aim is to demonstrate how the systematics of an interferometric measurement affect the quality of the calibrated data , how errors correlate and propagate , and in the long run how this can lead to new calibration strategies . </S>",
    "<S> we present results of these simulations and the inversion process and extraction procedure . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss some general properties of the coherency matrix and jones formalism that might prove useful in solving the calibration problem of aperture synthesis arrays . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that even in the presence of realistic noise and instrumental errors , the statistical signature of the eor signal can be detected by lofar with relatively small errors </S>",
    "<S> . a detailed study of the statistical properties of our data model and more complex instrumental models will be considered in the future .    </S>",
