    "the narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy 1h0707 - 495 is bright in soft x - rays where it shows the steep spectrum and rapid variability typical of its class .",
    "xmm - newton observations revealed a sharp drop in its spectrum around 7  kev , which can be interpreted either as an iron absorption feature or as the blue wing of a large broad emission line ( boller et al 2002 ; fabian et al 2002 ) .",
    "further observations showed the drop to shift to a higher energy ( gallo et al 2004 ) , possibly due to ionization changes .",
    "a 500  ks xmm observation of 1h0707 - 495 in 2008 provided clear support for the emission interpretation .",
    "a feature at 1  kev enables the spectrum to be decomposed into a power - law continuum with broad fe - k and fe - l emission lines ( fabian et al 2009 ) .",
    "these are expected from irradiation of an iron - rich accretion disc around a black hole and are well fitted by a relativistically - blurred reflection model ( fabian et al 2009 ; zoghbi et al 2010 ) .",
    "high frequency variations in the power - law continuum are followed about 30  s later by variations in the reflection component ( fabian et al 2009 ; zoghbi et al 2010 ) .",
    "such reverberation and its spectrum ( zoghbi et al 2011 ) are fully consistent with , and expected from , reflection .",
    "the data indicate a rapidly spinning black hole of mass @xmath0 and spin @xmath1 .",
    "the power - law continuum originates from a corona close ( @xmath2   r@xmath3 ) to the black hole .",
    "we report here on new xmm observations made in 2011 january in response to a prolonged drop in x - ray flux from 1h0707 - 495 seen in a monitoring campaign of the source made with the x - ray telescope on _ swift_. the spectrum shows the source at an unprecedented low level in the soft x - ray band .",
    "a reflection spectrum provides a good fit , and requires that the power - law continuum source has moved to within a radius 2r@xmath4 of the black hole .",
    "alternative interpretations are briefly discussed .",
    "deep xmm - rgs observations in 2008 show no evidence for a line - of - sight ionized wind or warm absorber in this object ( blustin & fabian 2009 ) and we do not pursue such models further here .",
    "other agn have been seen in a low state with strong reflection components ( e.g. 1h0419 - 577 , fabian et al 2005 ; ngc4051 , ponti et al 2006 ; pg1543 + 489 , vignali et al 2008 ; mrk335 , grupe et al 2008 ; pg1535 + 547 .",

    "the spectrum of 1h0707 - 495 presented here has the most extreme relativistic parameters yet seen .",
    ", and corrected for the galactic column . a systematic uncertainty of 25 per cent has been added in quadrature to measurements where the target position landed on or near bad ccd columns ( shown with open grey symbols ) .",
    "the epoch of the _ xmm - newton _ observation is indicated with a vertical arrow . ]    during the period 2010 march to 2011 march we monitored the x - ray and uv emission from 1h0707 - 495  using the _ swift _ satellite , in order to improve measurements of the low frequency power spectrum of the source .",
    "a @xmath51ks observation was obtained every @xmath54 days . in some cases , due to observational constraints , the 1ks exposure time was split into two or more short sub - exposures ( `` visits '' ) .",
    "we used an automated script to download the _ swift - xrt _  data from the heasarc quick look website shortly after they were obtained .",
    "the _ swift - xrt _  data were then processed and reduced through our automated pipeline , which combines a mixture of standard heasoft tools and some of our own routines .",
    "we outline the pertinent steps of our pipeline below .",
    "firstly the raw _ swift - xrt _  data is reprocessed with the xrtpipeline tool ( version 0.12.6 ) to produce a calibrated and cleaned events file . a zeroth order measure of the countrate",
    "is obtained by constructing a lightcurve ( using the xselect tool ) from the counts detected within a 30  arcsec radius aperture centered on the nominal position of 1h0707 - 495 . following the method of evans et al .",
    "( 2007 ) we then maximize the signal to noise ratio by using an adaptively sized aperture which is chosen to give the highest quality measurements of the the source countrate .",
    "the radius of the optimally sized circular aperture is determined from the zeroth order brightness , and for 1h0707 - 495  ranged between 17 and 45  arcsec .",
    "the background is estimated by measuring the countrate within an annular region surrounding the target aperture , and is subtracted taking account of the relative areas of the source and background regions .",
    "the effective area of _ swift - xrt _",
    "is strongly sensitive to the location of the source within the image plane and to the specific extraction aperture used .",
    "the following procedure is used to normalize the raw countrate .",
    "firstly the xrtmkarf tool is used to calculate an ancillary response function ( arf ) file for each visit , taking account of the exposure map at the location of the source and the aperture size used . using this arf together with the standard xrt response matrix , and adopting a spectral model of a @xmath6 powerlaw absorbed by the galactic column",
    ", we generate a fake visit spectrum using xspec .",
    "we then calculate the appropriate normalisation factor by dividing the countrate of the faked visit spectrum by the countrate expected from a faked spectrum generated using the nominal instrumental arf . using the faked spectrum associated with the nominal arf we calculate an approximate normalised countrate to flux conversion factor of 0.366cts@xmath7@xmath8erg@xmath9s@xmath7)@xmath7 for the 0.510kev band .",
    "uncertainties on countrates are estimated assuming poisson statistics , following the method of gehrels ( 1986 ) .",
    "note that during a number of visits , the target position landed directly on , or very close to , one of several bad columns on the xrt detector . in these cases",
    "the normalisation factor is somewhat uncertain , and so we have added in quadrature a systematic uncertainty of 25 per cent .",
    "the progress of the _ swift _ monitoring was checked regularly , and we noticed early in 2011 january ( around mjd 55570 ) that 1h0707 - 495  had become exceptionally faint in the x - ray band .",
    "swift _ too request was then initiated with daily monitoring of 1h0707 - 495  which confirmed the prolonged dip in the x - ray brightness .",
    "a section of the 0.510kev _ swift - xrt _  lightcurve , bracketing the pronounced dip in x - ray flux , is presented in fig .  1 .    the optical monitors on both _ swift _ and xmm - newton both record the uv flux of the source . no marked change was seen during the observations ( cameron et al , in preparation ) .",
    "1h0707 - 495 was observed with xmm - newton on 2011 january 1213 ( obs . i d 0554710801 ) in large window mode for a total exposure of 100 ks .",
    "the observational data files ( odf ) were reduced using xmm - newton science software sas v11.0.0 .",
    "there were some strong background flares during the observation , which were excluded in the spectral analysis leaving a total net exposure of 65 ks .",
    "standard filtering and event selection were applied .",
    "the source spectrum was extracted from a circular region of radius 35 arcsec centred on the source , and background from the the surrounding regions in the same chip .",
    "the spectra were then grouped using grppha so that each bin has a minimum of 50 counts .",
    "the response files were generated using rmfgen and arfgen .",
    "we show only pn data here , for ready comparison to the 2008 analysis and since the pn has better sensitivity in the fe - k band .",

    ".values of model parameters used in emisivity profile determination.the model used is phabs*zphabs*(blackbody+ kdblur*atable\\{reflionx.mod } ) .",
    "the two absorption components have a fixed galactic value and a variable intrinsic one , respectively .",
    "representative values from fits to the total 2008 data ( zoghbi et al 2011 ) are listed in the last column for comparison with the new results .",
    "the source varied considerably during the 500  ks observation .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ par.tab ]    the xmm - newton pn spectrum is shown in comparison to that of 2008 in fig .",
    "it is clear that there is a large , order of magnitude , drop in the soft flux below 1  kev , but only a factor of about 2 drop at 5 kev . in an @xmath10 spectral sense the hard flux peaks between 5 and 6  kev .",
    "other xmm observations of the source give spectra lying between those of 2008 and 2011 ( fig .",
    "2 ) , but at least a factor of 3 above that of 2011 in the soft band .",
    "we fit the 0.310  kev spectrum with a model similar to that used by fabian et al ( 2009 ) and zoghbi et al ( 2010 ) , consisting of a relativistically - blurred reflection component ( convolution model kdblur acting on ionized reflection model reflionx of ross & fabian 2005 ) ) and a low temperature blackbody .",
    "absorption by a galactic column density of @xmath11 ( kalberla et al 2005 ) is applied and intrinsic cold absorption is allowed in the fitting process . the blackbody emission in only important below 0.5  kev",
    "there is no evidence of the direct power - law continuum .",
    "the parameters of the model are given in table 1 and the fit is shown in fig .",
    "( the mos data give consistent results . )",
    "overall , the parameters are similar to those fitting the 2008 data , except that the photon index @xmath12 is flatter and the inclination is @xmath13   deg larger .",
    "the strong contribution of iron emission to the spectrum is demonstrated in fig .  4 , which was obtained by dropping the iron abundance in the model to its lowest value , 0.1 , plotting the ratio of the data to the model .",
    "strong broad fe - k and fe - l are again evident .",
    "it is plausible that the photon index can change between observations but not that the inclination can vary significantly , for such an inner region immediately around the black hole .",
    "examination of the spectrum shows that the previous inclination of around 58 deg is the best fit for the new data above 1.5  kev .",
    "the higher inclination is driven by a slight excess around 1  kev . as seen in the lower panel of fig .",
    "3 , the reflection is complex in this region .",
    "inclusion of another reflection component with the same parameters as the first except for a higher ionization parameter @xmath14 provides a better fit ( @xmath15 ; fig .  5 ) .",
    "it yields an inclination of @xmath16 deg , very close to that indicated by the 2008 results .",
    "we interpret this to mean that the surface of the disc has regions of different density .",
    "( the best fits to the 2008 data also required a similar additional high ionization component , fabian et al 2009 , zoghbi et al 2010 . )    the above fits use the relativistic - blurring kernel kdblur for strightforward comparison to earlier work .",
    "the inner radius measured indicates the extent of gravitational redshift required by the spectrum .",
    "the relativistic - blurring code kerrconv enables us to measure the black hole spin , for which we obtain @xmath17 , similar to that found by fabian et al ( 2009 ) and zoghbi et al ( 2010 ) .",
    "the emissivity index of the reflection then has @xmath18 .",
    "the assumption made in determining the spin in this way is that the inner radius , @xmath19 from which reflection is detected corresponds to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) around the black hole .",
    "the low value of @xmath20 found for the dominant reflection component means that the disc within @xmath21 is dense , and thus spatially thin . under those conditions we expect that @xmath19 is close to the isco ( reynolds & fabian 2008 ) . matter falling inside the isco on plunge orbits quickly drops to a much lower density where it becomes completely ionized , so producing no iron reflection features .",
    "a lightcurve of the whole observation is shown in fig .  6 in several energy bands , with higher resolution ( 200s bins ) of the whole band in fig .",
    "the source continues to show rapid variability with several sharp spikes of emission .",
    "we see several instances where the emission rises and drops by a significant amount ( factor of two ) on a timescale of just a few 100s .",
    "the variability is more pronounced at lower energies .",
    "this is shown in fig .  8 , where the root - mean - square fractional variability is plotted and compared with that of earlier observations .",
    "the count rate is too low to makes separate fits to the variations in 2011 .",
    "the drop in fractional variability around 0.9  kev evident in fig .",
    "8 has two possible interpretations .",
    "firstly , the flux could be low enough for a thermal component in the host galaxy to be relevant . in this case",
    "( narrow ) fe - l line emission would be significant at this energy and such a spatially - extended component would not vary .",
    "a thermal component is not , however , required by spectral modelling .",
    "( the count rate is too low for any meaningful rgs analysis . )",
    "secondly , the two component reflector model allows for spectral variability if the components vary on different timescales .",
    "since the higher ionization component dominates over the 0.71.2  kev band , it seems that this is the less variable one .",
    "we have therefore investigated a model in which the ionization parameter of the lowly ionization component varies up to @xmath22 .",
    "the fractional change is shown in fig .",
    "the model is not a fit .",
    "we do not pursue this further as more parameters could vary ( both values of @xmath20 , normalisations , @xmath12 etc ) in possibly complex and related ways , but the trend is remarkably similar to the observed values .",
    "our results show that most of the reflection originates from within a radius of @xmath21 where strong gravitational light bending must occur , enhancing the strength of the reflection component relative to the direct continuum ( martocchia & matt 1996 ; miniutti et al 2004 ) .",
    "we now examine what this means for the location of the primary source .",
    "the iron line emissivity profile of the accretion disc during the observation was obtained by fitting the photon counts ( normalisations ) of relativistically - broadened emission lines ( from the single reflionx x - ray reflection model convolved with the kdblur relativistic blurring kernel ) originating from successive annuli in the accretion disc to the observed iron k line in the reflection spectrum ( wilkins and fabian 2011 ) .",
    "the emissivity profile is approximated by a power law with a steep index of around 8 ( fig .",
    "further weak emission beyond @xmath23 with an index of between 3 and 4 over the outer regions of the disc is possible but is poorly constrained .",
    "the results are consistent with fitting a single , broadened , emission line profile ( laor ) with a power - law emissivity profile over the entire disc .",
    "the steep fall - off in emissivity over the inner part of disc results in the flux emitted from the outer disc regions being low , so the emissivity profile is less well constrained here .",
    "the emissivity profile has changed substantially from that found in xmm - newton epic pn spectra obtained in 2008 january ( wilkins and fabian 2011 ) , where fitting reflection from successive annuli in the accretion disc suggested a twice - broken power law form for the emissivity profile , with a steep index of 7.8 out to a radius of @xmath23 , where the profile flattened to an index of zero out to around @xmath24 before tending to an index of 3 over the outer regions of the disc .",
    "now almost 80 per cent of the emission orginates from within @xmath25 , compared with 50 per cent from that region in 2008 ( see fig .",
    "the conclusions are little changed if the emissivity index for the double reflector model ( @xmath26 ) is adopted .",
    "the emissivity profiles are compared to theoretical predictions obtained from ray tracing simulations .",
    "rays are traced from an isotropic point source at height @xmath27 above the plane of the accretion disc , either at rest on the rotation axis or offset from the axis , co - rotating with the disc below .",
    "rays are traced from the source in the kerr spacetime around the central black hole , until they reach the accretion disc in the equatorial plane , where their positions and redshifts are recorded .",
    "the emissivity profile is found by counting the total ( redshifted ) energy of rays landing in each bin , which is proportional to the square of the redshift as both the energy of individual photons and photon arrival rates are affected ( the emissivity profile is defined as the power emitted from the disc per unit area ) .",
    "the energy is divided by the area taking into account special and general relativistic effects due to the disc orbiting close to the black hole .    from the emissivity profile obtained from the 2008 january observation along with constraints from studying the x - ray variability and reverberation ( zoghbi et al 2010 )",
    ", it would appear that the accretion disc is illuminated by an x - ray source close to the disc , while extending radially to around @xmath28 ( fig  11 ) .",
    "classically , the emissivity profile is expected to be flat in the region below the source where @xmath29 , while tending to @xmath30 when @xmath31 , where the flux received by the disc from the source falls off as the inverse square of the distance with a further factor of r arising from the cosine of the angle projecting the ray normal to the disc plane .",
    "the reflected flux is enhanced over the inner region of the disc by relativistic effects where rays are focussed towards the central black hole while photons are blueshifted travelling inwards and the spacetime in the disc is warped , increasing the disc area , steepening the emissivity profile here .",
    "the current observation , however , reveals an emissivity profile explained by a compact source , confined to a small region around the rotation axis and close to the black hole . the source is now required to be at a height less than @xmath32 above the disc plane to explain the observed steepening over the inner region ( fig .  12 ) . with the source",
    "this close to the black hole , there is no flattened region in the emissivity profile .",
    "rather , the relativistic effects close to the black hole steepen the inner region of the profile out as far as the region where @xmath31 , so the emissivity profile takes the form of a once - broken power law from the steep inner profile to a profile slightly steeper than @xmath30 ( with the slight steeping from the classical case due to rays being focussed towards the black hole ) over the outer regions of the disc .",
    "ray tracing simulations also illustrate the variation in the reflected flux observed compared to that in the power law continuum as a function of the source height , by counting the photons in the simulation that hit the accretion disc compared to those which are able to escape to infinity ( fig .",
    "a similar result is obtained when considering the variation in reflected and continuum flux as a function of source radius from the rotation axis . the substantial drop in the observed power law continuum between the 2008 january observation and that of 2011 supports the hypothesis that the primary x - ray source has collapsed down to a region close to the black hole such that relativistic effects focus the majority of the rays towards the black hole and on to the disc , so a greater fraction of the emitted x - rays are reflected from the disc , while very few are able to escape as part of the continuum .",
    "the source thus becomes reflection dominated .",
    "the spectrum of the source is shown in fig .  14 as a ratio to the power - law plus blackbody model which best fits over the energy range 0.36  kev ( i.e. omitting the drop in the spectrum ) .",
    "the blackbody has a temperature of @xmath33 and the powerlaw index is @xmath34 .",
    "the spectral drop beginning at 6 kev is clear .",
    "the rest frame energy of the neutral iron absorption edge at 7.1  kev is indicated by a dotted line in the figure and is above the energy of the observed drop .",
    "the spectral index of the power - law component , which dominates from 1.56  kev , is flatter than any plausible comptonization process and so is not a reasonable solution .",
    "the emission from 1.510  kev is well fit by a gaussian component with a central energy of @xmath35 and dispersion of @xmath36 ( fig .  14 , upper centre ) .",
    "next , a partial - covering solution is shown in fig .",
    "14 ( lower centre ) with @xmath37 .",
    "it requires 92 per cent covering by neutral gas of column density @xmath38 with an iron abundance exceeding 80 times the solar value ( 90 per cent confidence level ) .",
    "both of these two models also require a blackbody component with a temperature of @xmath39 to account for the flux below 1  kev ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 in the 0.310  kev band for the gaussian and partial covering models , respectively ) .",
    "this `` soft excess '' component is common in agn and is unlikely to be a true blackbody associated , say , with the accretion disc since it shows a similar temperature over a wide range of object independent of black hole mass or accretion rate ( gierlinski & done 2004 ; crummy et al 2006 ) , contrary to the expectation of accretion theory .",
    "the simplest interpretation of such a ( roughly ) constant energy component is that it is due to atomic processes , in either absorption or emission .",
    "the lack of any sharp defining features requires that there is significant relativistic blurring which brings us back to strong reflection .    the strength of the drop at 67  kev , which requires a very extreme iron abundance ( much higher than required to explain the earlier spectra , boller et al 2002 ) , makes any partial - covering model implausible , in our view .",
    "this model was also the worst fit , particularly in the 46  kev band .",
    "a broad gaussian component could be due to a down - scattered iron emission line , say from fexxv at 6.7  kev . to be down - scattered to 4.7  kev requires about 40 compton collisions ( a thomson depth of about 6 ) , which would give a dispersion of about 0.4 kev .",
    "the fitted dispersion of 1.5  kev could then be explained by scatterer which is at @xmath42 .",
    "such a medium would have to be completely ionized in order that it does not absorb the emission .",
    "this does not however explain the source of such an intense iron emission line in the first place , nor will it easily fit the previous observations .    finally , a model with a power - law , @xmath43 , and blackbody components and two ionized absorbers ( xspec modelzxipcf @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 ; @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the covering fraction ) can give a fair fit ( @xmath51 for 343 d.o.f ; fig .",
    "14 , lower panel ) .",
    "the model has fe - l and other absorption lines .",
    "no such lines or evidence for an ionized absorber were seen in the deep rgs spectrum from 2008 when the source was brighter ( blustin & fabian 2009 ) .    no absorber model for the bright state spectrum of 1h0707 - 495",
    "has yet accounted for the structure around both 7  kev and 1  kev in any self - consistent manner , such as is achieved with the blurred reflection model .",
    "gallo et al ( 2004 ) , for example , added a gaussian emission line at 0.92  kev .",
    "the spectrum we report on here appears to be just a more redshifted , and fainter , version of the bright state spectrum ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "it does not make sense to us that the broad features in the low - state spectrum have a different physical origin to those in the high state .",
    "a major discovery from the 2008 xmm - newton data was a @xmath52 soft lag found at high frequencies by fabian et al ( 2009 ) and zoghbi et al ( 2010 ) .",
    "the lag was interpreted as the reverberation time delay due to the response of the reflection component , which dominated the soft flux ( @xmath53 ) , to variations in the power - law component , which is seen directly and dominates in the 13  kev band .",
    "although the lack of any power - law component and low soft count rate preclude any lag analysis with the 2011 data , the interpretation is fully consistent with the unobscured , inner reflection , model which we use here to understand the 2011 spectrum .",
    "miller et al ( 2010 ) have carried out a new timing analysis of the 2008 xmm - newton data of 1h0707 - 495 .",
    "they confirm the @xmath52 soft lag but claim that the size of the lag at higher energies rules out the inner reflection model and instead propose that the source is surrounded by a @xmath54  light sec radius scattering region .",
    "holes are envisaged in the scattering cloud such that direct flux does emerge along our line of sight .",
    "we do not replicate their result using standard timing procedures , finding on the contrary that the spectral dependence agrees well with our model ( zoghbi et al 2011 ) .",
    "we are unable to check their approach since it uses a new , but as yet unpublished method .",
    "their model is motivated by the presence of a large positive low frequency lag , in which the soft flux leads the harder flux .",
    "they argue that this is due to time delays in a large scattering cloud around the source . in their model ,",
    "direct emission is seen dominating at soft energies below 1  kev while the scattered / reflected flux dominates above that energy .",
    "no detailed model which fits the spectral data is presented by miller et al ( 2010 ) , but we note that their direct and scattered / reflected components dominate in the soft and hard bands in the opposite way to those of the inner reflection model .",
    "fabian et al ( 2009 ) and zoghbi et al ( 2010 ) comment that the low frequency lags are similar to those commonly seen in galactic binary black hole systems , where they are not due to scattering within a large cloud , and are likely to be due to accretion fluctuations propagating inward in the disc and communicated to the central coronal structure by magnetic fields from a range of radii .    in a model",
    "in which scattering occurs in a 1000  lt  s radius cloud , then the power spectrum of the scattered / reflected component ( hard band ) should be steeply attenuated above @xmath55 , due to light travel time smearing in the cloud , relative to the power spectrum of the direct component ( i.e. the soft band ) .",
    "the observed power spectra however show exactly the _ opposite _ behaviour ( see fig .  5 of zoghbi et al 2011 ) .",
    "the soft bands have less high - frequency power than the hard bands , which show no sign of attenuation due to light travel time effects , indeed they even show an enhancement at higher frequencies .",
    "finally , we note that recent discoveries of soft lags in other sources ( emmanoulopoulos et al 2011 , tripathi et al 2011 , de marco et al 2011 , zoghbi et al 2011 ) support the inner reflection model for the 2008 data of 1h0707 - 495 , and argue against any special geometry or source inclination for such sources .",
    "we infer that a model involving a large scattering cloud is an untenable interpretation of the xmm - newton data of 1h0707 - 495 .",
    "the sharp changes in the light curve shown in fig .",
    "7 are strong evidence against any significant scattering cloud being present in 2011 .",
    "the low - state observation of 1h0707 - 495 studied here shows a remarkable reflection - dominated spectrum and strong variability .",
    "we obtain a consistent solution to the degree of relativistic blurring required and lack of a power - law component if the black hole is spinning very fast with spin parameter @xmath56 , and the irradiating power - law source lies within @xmath57 of the black hole event horizon , i.e. at a radius of @xmath21 from the singularity . to our knowledge",
    "these are the first measurements _ dominated _ by emission from so close to the black hole .",
    "the low ionization parameter of the dominant reflection component means that the disc remains dense right to the innermost radii .",
    "this in turn implies that the disc remains thin .",
    "no strong poloidal magnetic fields are therefore expected so there is unlikely to be any strong blandford - znajek ( 1977 ) effect .",
    "orban de xivry et al ( 2011 ) argue that the extreme properties of narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies as a class is due to the growth of their black holes being dominated by internal secular evolution .",
    "this leads to prolonged gas accretion and high black hole spin .",
    "the main reduction in flux of 1h0707 - 495 , which is of an order of magnitude relative to 2008 , occurs in the soft band , below 1  kev .",
    "the hard band flux around 5  kev drops by only a factor of two .",
    "part of the soft flux drop is due to a change in the spectral index of the irradiating continuum , from @xmath58 to @xmath59 .",
    "the energy density in soft disc photons incident onto the power - law source will change as it approaches the black hole . assuming that the power - law emission is due to comptonization from constant temperature electrons ,",
    "then @xmath12 reduces ( the source hardens ) if the soft photon energy density reduces .",
    "it is plausible that the energy density drops very close to the black hole , in support of our interpretation .",
    "we shall examine this further with future detailed calculations .",
    "several alternative interpretations of the low - state spectrum have been studied .",
    "none offers a simple physical and consistent interpretation .",

    "<S> the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy 1h0707 - 495 went in to a low state from 2010 december to 2011 february , discovered by a monitoring campaign using the x - ray telescope on the swift satellite . </S>",
    "<S> we triggered a 100  ks xmm - newton observation of the source in 2011 january , revealing the source to have dropped by a factor of ten in the soft band , below 1  kev , and a factor of 2 at 5  kev , compared with a long observation in 2008 . </S>",
    "<S> the sharp spectral drop in the source usually seen around 7  kev now extends to lower energies , below 6  kev in our frame . </S>",
    "<S> the 2011 spectrum is well fit by a relativistically - blurred reflection spectrum similar to that which fits the 2008 data , except that the emission is now concentrated solely to the central part of the accretion disc . </S>",
    "<S> the irradiating source must lie within 1 gravitational radius of the event horizon of the black hole , which spins rapidly . </S>",
    "<S> alternative models are briefly considered but none has any simple physical interpretation .    </S>",
