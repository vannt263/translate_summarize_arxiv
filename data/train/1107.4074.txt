    "table [ tbl : detail ] lists the time periods for each of the five cruise measurements .",
    "each of the data collection periods lasted for greater than 24 hours , and some for over 60 hours . to ensure that the data analyzed here were acquired when the instrument parameters and background were reasonably constant , appropriate time windows were selected within each data collection period .",
    "for example , the cruise 0 period took place during the declining phase of a solar particle event , so the background was relatively high during the early portion of this collection period .",
    "thus , the selected time window for the cruise 0 period was the last 60 hours of the collection period , when the background was the lowest . for the other data collection periods ,",
    "data were excluded during the mercury flybys and when instrument parameters were varied for sensor testing .",
    "figure [ fig : peak ] shows an example anticoincidence pulse - height spectrum from the cruise 0 data collection period .",
    "figure [ fig : peak]a shows the electronic pulser peak used to correct for detector dead time ; figure [ fig : peak]b shows the 662 kev peak from the @xmath0cs decay .",
    "grs dead time is largely driven by a  1000 hz raw counting rate in the acs . the dead time is monitored by a 7.62939 hz electronic pulse fed directly across the hpge detector .",
    "the pulser line appears at a high energy in the pulse - height spectrum , far away from other prominent gamma - ray lines .",
    "the total counts in the pulser peak are obtained by fitting a linear function to the underlying background , subtracting this background from the pulse height spectra , and summing the net counts .",
    "the live time fraction is the ratio of the measured counts to the expected number of pulser counts .",
    "for the five measurement periods , the live time fraction varied from 0.9 to 0.94 .",
    "cs data ( solid line ) , background in the region around the @xmath0cs line ( dashed line ) , and net @xmath0cs spectrum ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "solid vertical lines show the energy window over which the counts are determined .",
    "[ fig : peak ] ]    the total counts in the @xmath0cs peak are determined by dividing the spectra by the live time fraction , fitting a second - degree polynomial function to the background above and below the peak ( dashed line in figure [ fig : peak]b ) , subtracting this background , and then summing the net counts ( dot - dashed line ) within a window around the peak .",
    "the count rate uncertainties are calculated by assuming all uncertainties are due to poisson counting statistics .",
    "specifically , if the total net counts within the energy window are @xmath56 , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the total spectrum and background counts within the energy window , respectively , then the total count uncertainty , @xmath59 , is    @xmath60    the corresponding count rate uncertainty is :    @xmath61    the uncertainty associated with the live time correction is neglected because its magnitude is almost an order of magnitude lower than that of the uncertainty for the @xmath0cs peak .",
    "one other point regarding the grs is that in order to reduce energy spreading effects from gcr radiation damage , the grs is periodically annealed at high temperatures .",
    "since launch , the grs has been annealed four times ( no annealing was carried out prior to cruise 4 ) .",
    "one consequence of annealing is that the active volume of the germanium crystal may shrink slightly , which in turn will slightly reduce the overall detector efficiency . by monitoring the position of the pulser peak after each annealing operation",
    ", we can estimate the change in detector capacitance , and therefore the active detector volume , by assuming a simple coaxial geometry for the hpge detector .",
    "since launch , the pulser peak has shifted @xmath627% , which equates to less than @xmath620.7% loss in detector volume ; however , the actual change in detector efficiency at 662 kev is not easily calculated ( perhaps it could be better modeled through a monte carlo simulation ) , but would likely lie between the estimates for the capacitance and volume .",
    "such efficiency changes have not been included in this analysis . for future analyses ,",
    "efficiency corrections can be monitored and/or included by observing changes in peak counts associated in time with annealing events , as well as by modelling the grs efficiency response .",
    "following the preceding discussion , we have determined @xmath5 by using eq .",

    "@xcite found a fractional change of @xmath70 in @xmath71 from perihelion to aphelion , and this level of sensitivity may be achievable following moi given the result in eq .",
    "( [ delta2 ] ) as we now discuss .",
    "the result in eq . ( [ delta2 ] ) suggests that the availability of a much larger data set following moi on 18 march 2011 could lead to significantly improved constraints on @xmath5 for @xmath0cs . in this section ,",
    "we simulate post - moi data that can be expected in order to estimate the level of improvement on @xmath5 that might be realized .",
