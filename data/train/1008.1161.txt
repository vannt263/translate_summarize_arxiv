    "the electrons at high energy state move at the same speed with the low energy state , which is the constant fermi velocity in graphene . at high field , more electrons move into high energy states .",
    "but the increasing of velocity is not as rapidly as conventional parabolic materials . as more and more electrons occupy high energy states the backscattering",
    "is increased , which degrades the average velocity of electron gas and leads to ndr",

    "high energy electrons exchange their momentum and energy with low energy electrons before substantial backscatterings happen . with e - e scatterings , the hot electrons generation and backscattering are weakened and the ensemble velocity of carriers increases with the applied electric field .",
    "the current - field curves from the mc simulation therefore show that a ) the hot phonon effect acts as a strong current limiting mechanism at high carrier densities and b ) e - e scattering gets rid of ndr effect in graphene .    in fig.[mcresults](b ) , the saturation current is plotted against the carrier density .",
    "the solid black curve is the analytical result from streaming model ( equation [ jsatofstreamingmodel ] ) for comparison .",
    "the solid squares are the intrinsic saturation currents without the hot phonon effect .",

    "compared to the solid distribution curve , the distribution without e - e scattering has more electrons at high energy states , but also more backscattered electrons .",
    "this highlights the role of e - e scattering in maintaining the shape of carrier distribution close to fermi - dirac like ( the solid line ) and thus preventing the ndr effect .",
    "similarly , the effect of hot phonons becomes clear when we compare the distribution functions shown by the solid and dashed curve .",
    "the carrier distribution with hot phonons is shifted less along the field direction , so the saturation current is lowered by the hot - phonon effect .",
    "= 3.6 in    the effect of hot phonons on the transport can also be seen from the phonon distribution in @xmath88-space .",
    "fig.[distributionfunctons](b ) shows the 2d phonon distribution functions @xmath101 .",
    "the hot phonon distribution has a peak at positive @xmath102 , which corresponds to the fast optical phonon emission by hot electrons .",
    "the phonon occupation number peak exceeds @xmath103 which corresponds to a phonon temperature of @xmath104 k.    besides the steady - state saturation currents , the mc simulation procedure also allows us to study transient phenomena in high - field carrier transport . prior",
    "to approaching steady state , carriers moving short distances in traditional semiconductors are known to undergo transient velocity overshoot , attaining higher velocities than what can be attained in the steady state .",
    "the hot electrons accelerated by high field keep moving in @xmath20 space without significant phonon emission during timescales shorter than the mean phonon emission time . as a result",
    ", a velocity peak is achieved in a short period . in high speed electronic devices ,",
    "the channel length is scaled to tens of nanometers .",
    "the carriers travel from source to drain contacts within ps timescales , and velocity overshoot can occur .",
    "this transient velocity overshoot can be utilized to lower the transit time of carriers in graphene devices , thus resulting in an enhanced speed .",
    "fig.[vdvstime](a ) shows the ensemble transient velocity response to electric fields .",
    "velocity overshoot occurs when the electric field is higher than 5 kv / cm .",
    "the higher the field , the higher is the overshoot velocity peak ; it approaches @xmath105 cm / s at a field of 50 kv / cm for the chosen carrier density ( @xmath106/@xmath1 ) . after reaching the peak overshoot velocity ,",
    "the ensemble drift velocity decreases gradually by dissipating excess energy into the graphene crystal in the form of optical phonon vibrations .",
    "the long tail of decreasing velocity is due to the hot phonon effect - optical phonons are slow in decaying into acoustic modes which heat up the lattice .",
    "velocity overshoot occurs within a time window of @xmath107 ps .",
    "if the channel length ( @xmath108 ) is short enough ( @xmath109 ) , the hot carrier energy is dissipated at the drain contact , and the hot phonon effect can be prevented in a short channel device .",
    "thus , the distance @xmath110 that carriers travel in the velocity overshoot period is crucial for the design of high - speed devices .",
    "the transit times @xmath111 given by @xmath112 is calculated from the result in fig[vdvstime](a ) and shown for various lengths in [ vdvstime](b ) . for short channel lengths , the transit time is sensitive to the magnitude of the electric field , since velocity overshoot increases with electric field . for long channel lengths , a major portion of the transit time",
    "is spent traveling at the steady state drift velocity , and the overshoot velocity makes a minor contribution . in the mc simulation , the transit time is not found to be particularly sensitive to the carrier density , which bodes well for devices requiring high currents and high speeds . in a @xmath113 nm long channel device , the transit time is found to be @xmath114 ps , which is exactly the time window for velocity overshoot .",
    "thus , graphene channels @xmath115 nm can fully take advantage of velocity overshoot for enhancing their speed .    the peak overshoot velocity , and overshoot time window ( @xmath116 ) is determined by strength of electron - optical phonon interaction , the optical phonon energy , as well as the low - field mobility .",
    "the optical phonon energy and carrier - phonon interaction are intrinsic properties of material , but the peak overshoot velocity peak can be improved by increasing the cleanliness of the substrate or by using gate dielectrics with less impurities .",
    "we point out some limitations of this work , and suggest topics that need investigation in the future . in this work",
    "we have ignored the band to band processes , e.g. inter - band ( zener ) tunneling and e - e scattering induced carrier generation . the carrier concentration does not change at high electric field under the assumption . however , this is not the case in graphene if the fermi level is close to the dirac point .",
    "since the band gap is zero , tunneling and e - e scatterings generate electrons and holes under high fields at very low carrier concentrations . in experimental measurements , the current increases and",
    "never saturates when the fermi level is close to the dirac point in intrinsic graphene ( @xmath117 ) @xcite .",
    "field - induced carrier generation is also the reason of the low on / off ratio ( @xmath118 ) in graphene fets .    in experiments , intrinsic properties of graphene",
    "is difficult to achieve .",
    "so phonon scattering limits the high field transport for graphene in close proximity to substrates with low energy phonon modes , like sio@xmath4 .",
    "suspended graphene is free from environmental scattering effects , but the carrier density is not easy to modulate .",
    "one possible way to measure the intrinsic performance is to use sic substrate graphene which has weak so phonon coupling .",
    "we assumed the lattice temperature to be at 300 k in our simulations , although the optical phonon temperature can be much higher than environment temperature 300 k. this assumption could overestimate the saturation current , since the lattice temperature in graphene increases due to the limited thermal conductance of the substrate and contacts .",
    "the hot phonon effect is dominant , so to a certain extent ignoring the rise of lattice temperature is justified .",
    "the phonon lifetime has been measured for graphene on sic substrate and it was found to be around 2.5 ps @xcite . the hot phonon effect can be diminished by introducing isotopic disorder into graphene @xcite .",
    "isotopic disorder introduces phonon modes that are localized in real space , and therefore spread in @xmath119-space , and more phonon modes are thus involved in the cooling of carriers .",
    "the saturation currents can be improved by this disorder engineered lifetime of optical phonons , with direct consequences of higher saturation currents .    in conclusion , we investigated the high field transport in intrinsic monolayer graphene .",
    "mc simulation results show that both hot - phonon effect and e - e scattering have strong impacts on the saturation current .",
