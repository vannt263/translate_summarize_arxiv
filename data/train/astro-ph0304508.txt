    "the 1809  kev  line of @xmath0al  was the first astronomical gamma - ray line from radioactive decay discovered in the galaxy @xcite , confirming a prediction made by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is the brightest galactic line after the line from positron annihilation at 511 kev .",
    "this first result was from _",
    "heao  3 , which used high - resolution germanium detectors .",
    "@xcite found that the line width was consistent with their instrumental resolution of about 3  kev , but the statistical significance of the result was low ( 4.8  @xmath1 ) . _",
    "this isotope is thought to be produced by proton capture on magnesium , and therefore can occur in any site of nucleosynthesis where these two components are abundant @xcite .",
    "environments suggested for its creation and release into the interstellar medium include type - ii supernovae , novae , and the winds of wolf - rayet and asymptotic giant branch stars . because its half - life is around 10@xmath3 yr , much shorter than scales of galactic evolution , its distribution on the sky reflects the current galactic distribution of the relevant parent events .",
    "maps of the galactic 1809  kev  emission ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) were made with the comptel instrument on the _ compton gamma - ray observatory and have given us the first detailed look at where the emission is concentrated .",
    "the maps correlate better with early than late stellar populations , suggesting that supernovae and/or wolf - rayet stars are likely to be the primary contributors .",
    "_    many other observations of this line , with high- and low - resolution balloon instruments and with low - resolution satellite instruments , have occurred since _ heao  3 ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "only one high - resolution measurement has had a statistical significance comparable to the _ heao  3 data and thus been able to further advance our understanding of the shape of the line .",
    "this was performed by the gamma - ray imaging spectrometer ( gris ) balloon @xcite .",
    "the authors found the line to be significantly broadened , with an intrinsic width of @xmath4  kev derived from a measured width of @xmath5  kev by subtracting their instrumental width of @xmath6  kev in quadrature .",
    "the significance of their overall detection was @xmath7 , slightly higher than that of _ heao  3 .",
    "_ _ _    this doppler broadening corresponds to isotropic velocities of 540  km  s@xmath8 or a temperature of @xmath9k @xcite , and there is no model for how either could be maintained by a gas in the interstellar medium for anything approaching the lifetime of the isotope .",
    "this result has stimulated interesting theoretical work centered on concentrating the @xmath0al  in grains , which can maintain their birth velocities much longer than gaseous material and even be re - accelerated in supernova shocks @xcite .",
    "the _ reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager ( rhessi ) is a nasa small explorer satellite in a nearly circular @xmath10600  km orbit ( 96minute period ) with inclination @xmath1038@xmath11 .",
    "its primary mission is to make high - resolution images and spectra of solar flares in the range from 3  kev to 17  mev @xcite .",
    "its detector array is a set of nine high - purity coaxial germanium detectors cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature by a stirling - cycle refrigerator @xcite .",
    "each of _ rhessi s detectors is segmented into a thin front segment facing the sun ( to stop hard x - rays ) and a much thicker rear segment meant to record solar gamma - rays that penetrate the front segment .",
    "because the front segments have little effective area at 1809  kev  for any incident angle , i did not use them for this analysis .",
    "one of the nine detectors operates in an unsegmented mode with poor energy resolution , and is excluded as well .",
    "the spacecraft rotates at close to 15  rpm about the axis pointing at the sun .",
    "_ _    because the array is unshielded and the spacecraft is very light , the effective area of the array to highly penetrating 1809  kev  photons is nearly independent of the direction of incidence , either in azimuth or zenith angle with respect to the spacecraft axis .",
    "this has been verified with monte carlo simulations using the geant3 package with a highly detailed model of the spacecraft , which show a maximum deviation of @xmath1210% at any angle from the mean effective area averaged over all angles .",
    "thus the annual rotation of the spacecraft with respect to the stars can not be used to modulate the galactic signal as was done with data from the _ solar maximum mission gamma - ray spectrometer @xcite . as an additional complication",
    ", there is a background line in the instrument at 1809  kev  due to cosmic - ray interactions with aluminum in the spacecraft .",
    "this must be understood and subtracted before the galactic line can be studied .",
    "_    the lack of directionality and strong background line can be overcome by using the earth as an occulter . to begin the analysis",
    ", i divided nine months of rhessi data ( 1 march 2002 to 2 december 2002 ) into one - minute ( and therefore spin - averaged ) intervals .",
    "i defined the `` inner galaxy '' as a box running from @xmath13 in galactic longitude and @xmath14 in galactic latitude .",
    "`` source '' intervals were times when this entire box was unocculted by the earth , and `` background '' intervals were defined as times when it was entirely occulted . the rest of the data were discarded .",
    "because the earth subtends less than half the sky , the set of source pointings is larger .",
    "the total amount of time accumulated in the source spectra is 75.0 dy , and the total accumulation of background data is 33.7 dy .",
    "data contaminated by the precipitation of magnetospheric electrons were identified with the onboard particle detector and were removed from consideration , as were data taken during the x4.8 solar flare of 23 july , the only flare observed so far with emission at energies approaching 1809  kev .",
    "the background subtraction algorithm is adapted from one used to derive the most precise value to date for the flux of positron - annihilation radiation from the galactic center region : @xmath15@xmath16 ph  @xmath17  s@xmath8  @xcite . in that case",
    "the instrument was the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on the _ compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) .",
    "the principle is to sort the background spectra into a two - dimensional library based on the two most important parameters that control the background . for each source spectrum ,",
    "a background spectrum is generated by selecting among the library spectra using the values of the controlling parameters for that source spectrum .",
    "the computer code tracks the repeated contributions of each original raw background spectrum in order to propagate statistical errors correctly . _",
    "all background lines with half - lives less than a few hours are fairly well controlled by choosing two particular parameters on which to sort the library : the longitude of the ascending node ( lan ) of the current orbit , and the orbital phase since the ascending node ( pan ) .",
    "these parameters define a particular spot on the earth , so that the cosmic - ray flux ( which is controlled primarily by geomagnetic latitude ) is reproduced .",
    "the lines with half - lives of seconds or less are proportional to the instantaneous cosmic - ray flux : this includes the 1809  kev  background line due to cosmic - ray production of @xmath18 mg in aluminum , which decays with a 0.49  ps half - life @xcite .",
    "unlike simple geographic or geomagnetic coordinates , however , lan and pan also contain a memory of the recent history of the spacecraft trajectory ",
    "most usefully , how recently and how deeply the spacecraft passed through the saa . thus matching lan and",
    "pan also produces a good match for the saa - induced background lines , which have half - lives from minutes to hours .",
    "we see such a line around 1811  kev that blends with the 1809  kev  line .",
    "the only candidate in the gamma - ray tables of @xcite is the 1810.77  kev line of @xmath19mn ( half - life 2.6  hr ) , presumably created by interactions of saa protons with iron near the detectors .",
    "this line was suggested as a contributor to the background of the germanium spectrometer on the _ wind spacecraft @xcite , and the published 1809  kev  background line from _ heao  3 @xcite shows an excess in the blue wing that is consistent with the @xmath19mn line appearing at a low level .",
    "there is no very long - lived background line ( such as the 1275  kev line from @xmath20na ) near 1809  kev .",
    "such a line would require a background - selection system which is cognizant of the total time since the start of the mission , rather than relying entirely on lan and pan . _ _",
    "figure  1 ( left ) shows the rhessi background - subtracted spectrum of the galactic @xmath0al  line . the smooth curve shown is 3% of the average background for comparison .",
    "fitting the spectrum from 17901825  kev to a gaussian plus a linear background , i find a center energy of @xmath21  kev , 1.2@xmath1 from the expected rest energy of the line at 1808.65  kev @xcite .",
    "the area of the line is @xmath22@xmath23 counts  s@xmath8(11@xmath1 ) , which is 12.9% of the background line ( averaged over the entire set of background spectra interpolated from the background library ) .",
    "its fwhm , which includes instrumental broadening , is @xmath24  kev .",
    "the fit is good ( @xmath25 = 26.7 with 30 degrees of freedom ) .    by fitting seven narrow background lines ranging from 186  kev to 2243  kev ,",
    "i interpolate the intrinsic instrumental resolution to its value at 1809  kev  and find @xmath26  kev .",
    "i avoid the instrumental background line at 1809  kev  itself because of the blend with the line at 1811  kev , which makes it much broader than the interpolation ( @xmath27  kev fwhm ) and raises its center energy to @xmath28  kev . subtracting the instrumental resolution in quadrature from the galactic line",
    "gives an intrinsic width of @xmath2  kev , corresponding to velocities of @xmath10200  km / s or a temperature of @xmath29k .    to demonstrate the quality of the background subtraction , i show in figure  1 ( right ) the region around a background line at 1014  kev .",
    "this line , like the background line at 1809  kev , is due to the prompt decay of a short - lived isomer created by cosmic - ray interactions in aluminum .",
    "thus , if it subtracts well , one should be able to assume that the 1809  kevbackground line does also .",
    "the figure demonstrates subtraction better than the 3% shown for comparison . there is a hint of a residual 1014  kev line which",
    ", when fit with a gaussian , gives a flux of @xmath30% of the background line .",
    "the averaged cosmic - ray count rate in the detectors over all the periods used for source pointings is 0.46% higher than the same average over the background periods .",
    "this is consistent with the slight undersubtraction hinted at in figure  1 ( right ) .",
    "i find that subtracting out an extra 0.46% or 1.2% of the 1809  kevbackground line has no significant effect on the galactic 1809  kev  line width , whether i use the natural form of the background spectrum ( which includes the 1811  kev line ) or whether i substitute an artificial single gaussian line at exactly 1808.65  kev with the instrumental resolution .",
    "since the galactic line flux is 12.9% of the average background , these extra subtractions would reduce its value by 4% and 9% , respectively .    to further demonstrate that the cosmic - ray - induced background line is well - subtracted , i divided the data set into two roughly equal parts by the value of the cosmic - ray count rate during each one - minute spectrum .",
    "the rate averaged 158 counts s@xmath8 for the lower data set and 237 counts s@xmath8 for the higher data set , for a ratio of 1.50 .",
    "the count rate in the total , unsubtracted 1809  kev  line had a similar ratio of 1.42 , with 8.00@xmath23 counts  s@xmath8  and 11.36@xmath23 counts  s@xmath8  in the two sets , respectively .",
    "once the backgrounds were subtracted , however , the values for the residual ( galactic ) line were @xmath31@xmath23 counts  s@xmath8and @xmath32@xmath23 counts  s@xmath8 , respectively , a ratio of only 1.09 and well within statistical agreement .",
    "the derived galactic signal thus appears to be independent of the intensity of the background line .",
    "the conversion of the count rate in the galactic line to a total galactic flux is strongly dependent on the assumed galactic distribution .",
    "the effective area of the eight rear segments used , calculated at 1809  kev  using the distribution of angles of incidence over the observation period assuming the source is concentrated at the galactic center , is 20.5  @xmath33 .",
    "the incident flux is then @xmath34@xmath35 ph  @xmath17  s@xmath8  for the artificial case of a point source .",
    "since the effective area of the instrument is nearly independent of angle , the model distribution is important in determining the flux only because of occultation of parts of the distribution by the earth .",
    "as noted above , i required the inner 60@xmath11 of galactic longitude to be visible in each pointing , but on average a considerable additional amount of the plane is also included .",
    "a certain amount of this high - longitude plane emission also appears in the background intervals , however , and is subtracted off .",
    "adding the gris best - fit value of 5.4  kev for the galactic line width in quadrature with _ rhessi s instrumental resolution would give a 6.78  kev width .",
    "fixing the width at that value for the fit from 17901825  kev causes @xmath36 to increase by 17.3 to 44.0 ( now with 31 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the probability of _ rhessi s result being consistent with the gris best fit is then 4@xmath37 for one parameter of interest . _ _    the _ rhessi value for the galactic line s width is only marginally consistent with zero .",
    "it is expected , however , that the interstellar @xmath0al  will share in galactic rotation and display appropriate doppler shifts @xcite . @xcite",
    "combined a three - dimensional model @xmath0al  distribution derived from comptel data with a galactic rotation model to produce a map of the radial velocity versus galactic longitude ( integrated over galactic latitude and line of sight ) .",
    "this map has a galactic bulge component with velocities up to @xmath1075 km / s and spiral arm components with velocities up to @xmath10150 km / s .",
    "although an integration of this map over the inner galaxy has not been published , from the slices shown at different longitudes it appears that a integrated fwhm of not more than 150 km / s or about 0.9  kev would be obtained .",
    "this is within 1@xmath1 of our result .",
    "additional broadening due to more local motions of the @xmath0al - bearing gas or dust is possible , and of course the most recently - created portion of the @xmath0al  can be traveling near its birth velocity in supernovae , etc .",
    ", even if this portion is small .",
    "_    _ rhessi s flux value of @xmath38@xmath35 ph  @xmath17  s@xmath8  is comparable to previous measurements . a value of @xmath39@xmath35 ph  @xmath17  s@xmath8  rad@xmath8 was considered consistent with the existing ensemble of data sets at the time by @xcite . for a uniform distribution in the plane",
    ", this would imply about 1.4  rad for _",
    "rhessi s effective field of view ( including the effect of subtracted flux in the background pointings ) .",
    "realistic distributions fall off with longitude , however , and would require an even larger effective field of view .",
    "@xcite , however , using the gris data , found higher fluxes per radian , with the value depending on the model used and ranging up to @xmath40@xmath35 ph  @xmath17  s@xmath8  rad@xmath8 assuming the comptel distribution available at that time .",
    "they suggested that comptel , which subtracts background by imaging with the compton telescope technique , would be insensitive to a spatially diffuse component that the large , integrating field of view of gris would accept . at first glance",
    "the _ rhessi result seems to support this higher value , since the effective field of view required to match the gris data , 1.04 radians , is identical to the region i required to be visible for the source intervals . in future work",
    ", these _ rhessi source and background fields of view , with the addition of data from those times in which the central radian is partially occulted , will be convolved with different model distributions to provide a normalization for each distribution and to help choose among them .",
    "comparison with upcoming results from integral / spi , which has a smaller field of view , will allow us to test for the existence of very large - scale diffuse emission .",
    "_ _ _ _    i would like to thank the rest of the _ rhessi team for making this work possible , particularly those who worked on the spectrometer and the data - analysis software .",
