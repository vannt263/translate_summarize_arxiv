    "the collective ( or chemical ) surface diffusion coefficient , @xmath0 , is defined via the fick s first law and represents a relevant transport coefficient for surface diffusion .",
    "theoretical studies of @xmath0 and of the influence of lateral interparticle interactions on @xmath0 have often used lattice - gas models to simulate surface diffusion . in the models the migration of adparticles is given by the potential relief of the substrate surface : most of the time the adparticles stay at the positions ( sites ) where the relief attains its minima , but from time to time they perform random jumps to the adjacent vacant sites . assuming the jumps to be instant , the states of the system of adparticles are represented by the occupation numbers ( one for each site ) , as in a lattice gas .",
    "although this description is rather oversimplifying , it should possess the key aspects of the diffusion and , moreover , it can be treated by a number of statistical mechanical methods , such as the mean - field , real - space renormalization group , and computer simulation techniques @xcite .    in order to determine @xmath0 in general ,",
    "one should solve a system of balance equations for a large number of adparticles that may strongly interact with each other as well as with the substrate surface .",
    "an analytic treatment of such a formidable kinetic problem often resorts to some kind of approximation .",
    "in particular , assuming that the adparticle surface coverage varies only very slowly with time and space ( the local equilibrium limit ) , purely thermodynamic quantities are sufficient to obtain @xmath0 , i.e. , the problem reduces to the evaluation of the finite - size specific free energy , @xmath7 , of the system @xcite .",
    "namely , assume that the jumps of adparticles are mutually uncorrelated and restricted to nearest neighbors .",
    "in addition , assume that an activated adparticle at a saddle point of the potential barrier interacts only with the nearest - neighbor adparticles . then the original problem can be reduced to a diffusion equation , with the corresponding diffusion coefficient given as @xcite @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the diffusion coefficient of non - interacting particles , @xmath10 is the inverse temperature , @xmath11 is the chemical potential , @xmath12 is the isothermal susceptibility , and @xmath13 is a correlation factor .",
    "both @xmath12 and @xmath13 can be expressed as derivatives of @xmath7 [ see eqs .   and below ] . for lattice gases the local equilibrium approximation that leads to an expression for @xmath0 given only via thermodynamic quantities turns out to be fairly plausible :",
    "the results obtained from it by the analytical methods have been in quite good agreement with the numerical results obtained by kinetic simulations @xcite .",
    "the correlation factor @xmath13 is associated with the interactions of an activated adparticle with other particles .",
    "it is given as a sum of the probabilities that certain clusters of adjacent sites are vacant @xcite .",
    "the clusters contain a lattice bond representing the two sites between which a particle jump is performed , plus the neighboring sites with which an activated adparticle is supposed to interact .",
    "usually , only the sites nearest to the saddle point are considered .",
    "then the clusters are quite small ; for example , for a triangular lattice these are only bonds and elementary triangles and parallelograms @xcite .",
    "clearly , the probabilities that clusters are vacant may be expressed via derivatives of @xmath7 with respect to suitable interparticle interaction parameters , @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , quite generally , @xmath13 has the form given as @xmath15 where the constants @xmath16 may depend on the interaction parameters of an activated adparticle .",
    "one of the intriguing problems that has attracted particular attention is the presence of phase transitions and their effects on surface diffusion .",
    "since lattice gases can be used to model such transitions , they have provided a convenient framework also in this regard @xcite .",
    "however , below critical temperatures ordered phases may arise due to lateral interactions , and sophisticated arguments should be applied to analyze surface diffusion @xcite .",
    "in fact , very low temperatures have not been considered in the previous studies .    in this paper",
    "we wish to fill in this gap and study the diffusion coefficient @xmath0 at all sufficiently low temperatures , concentrating on its dependence on the surface coverage , chemical potential , and system s size .",
    "our analysis is based on two key points .",
    "first , we assume that @xmath0 can be approximated by the expression  , which is appropriate only in the local equilibrium limit and under the above - mentioned restrictions on the adparticle jumps .",
    "then @xmath0 can be obtained just from the finite - size specific free energy @xmath17 of the system , where @xmath4 is the number of adparticles in the system and @xmath18 is its finite - size partition function .",
    "second , we assume that a first - order phase transition between two low - temperature phases , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , takes place in the system at a transition point @xmath21 .",
    "consequently , we will be able to employ the formula @xcite @xmath22 ( 1 + r)\\ ] ] that is applicable near the transition point @xmath23 for a large class of lattice - gas models with periodic boundary conditions , such as the models with a finite range @xmath24-potential and a finite number of ground states . here",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 is the degeneracy and single - phase specific free energy of phase @xmath27 , respectively , and the error term @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "[ the symbol @xmath29 represents a term that can be bounded by @xmath30 .",
    "] combining eqs .   to , we will obtain analytic formulas for the dependence of @xmath0 on the chemical potential and coverage near the transition .",
    "we find it useful to illustrate the general results with a specific lattice - gas model .",
    "therefore , we will consider a model on a regular triangular lattice in which phase transitions between ordered phases can occur .",
    "moreover , instead of the general form   of the correlation factor @xmath13 , we will work with the widely used form in which @xmath13 is identified with the probability that a lattice bond is vacant .",
    "this corresponds to the simplest case when an activated adparticle does not interact with any neighbors .",
    "then , for the triangular lattice , one has @xcite",
    "@xmath31 where @xmath1 and @xmath32 is the statistical average number ( per site ) of occupied sites and bonds , respectively .",
    "( note that @xmath1 is the surface coverage . )",
    "we will eventually show that our results can be , after additional analysis , extended to the general form   of @xmath13 .",
    "the paper has the following structure . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] the illustrative model of surface diffusion on the triangular lattice is introduced and its low temperature phases and free energy @xmath7 are described .",
    "the coverage dependence of @xmath0 is analyzed in sec .",
    "[ sec : dc ] .",
    "the derivation of general finite - size formulas for this dependence is presented , and the general results are applied to the considered model . concluding remarks , including the extension of the obtained results to the general form of @xmath13 , are given in a final section .",
    "the model assumes that particles can be adsorbed on a solid surface only at sites forming a regular triangular lattice .",
    "the system contains a rectangular array with a large but finite number , @xmath4 , of adsorption sites .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied so that the array forms a finite torus . setting the mesh size equal to @xmath33 ,",
    "the elementary lattice vectors are taken as @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the torus cell is specified by the vectors @xmath36 and @xmath37 with @xmath38 ; thus , @xmath39 .",
    "each lattice site is either vacant or occupied by a particle .",
    "the interaction between two particles is limited to nearest - neighbor pairs ( bonds ) with an interaction energy that depends on the surrounding particles in the simplest possible way  only on the presence of particles at the sites closest to the bond .",
    "for the triangular lattice there are two such sites .",
    "the bond together with either of the sites forms an elementary triangle .",
    "hence , the varying interaction energy is equivalent to having two constant interaction energies : one , @xmath40 , for occupied bonds and one , @xmath41 , for occupied elementary triangles .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is given as @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the number of occupied bonds , elementary triangles , and sites , respectively .",
    "this model was already used to study surface diffusion at high temperatures in the special cases when @xmath46 ( for @xmath47 above @xmath48 ) and @xmath49 ( with @xmath47 above @xmath50 ) @xcite . here",
    "we consider the general case when both the bond and triangle interactions @xmath40 and @xmath41 are present , and temperatures are supposed to be sufficiently low .",
    "as we proved in @xcite , model   has four ground states [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : gs](a ) ] : a fully vacant state , @xmath51 , a fully occupied state , @xmath52 , and two threefold degenerate states , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the coverage of the two latter states is only partial , namely , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "the ground - state diagram is shown in fig .  [",

    "[ fig : gs ] ) , only these two ground states coexist .",
    "however , on the remaining lines ( the solid lines in fig .  [ fig : gs ] ) as well as at the points where three or all four ground - state regions meet , there is an infinite number of ground states , yielding in fact a residual entropy .    .",
    "on the boundaries between two ground - state regions either the two ground states coexist ( the dashed lines ) or there are infinitely many ground states ( the solid lines , including their end - points depicted by disks).,title=\"fig : \" ] +    each ground state @xmath61 , @xmath62 , gives rise to a unique low - temperature phase , @xmath63 , whose typical configuration looks as a ` sea ' of the ground state @xmath61 in which isolated ` islands ' of non - ground - state configurations are scattered , thus resembling the structure of @xmath61 .",
    "so , phase @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) is fully vacant ( fully occupied ) , while phase @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) has the occupancy of @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the existence of these low - temperature phases can be concluded only if the number of ground states is finite , i.e. , only within each ground - state region and on the lines between these regions where only two ground states coexist ( the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : gs ] ) .",
    "otherwise , no conclusions concerning low - temperature phases were drawn in @xcite .",
    "consequently , a first - order phase transition can take place between phases @xmath64 and @xmath65 , @xmath64 and @xmath67 , and @xmath66 and @xmath65 , whereas transitions between other phases need not be of first - order .",
    "let us consider a pair of phases , @xmath20 and @xmath19 , between which a first - order phase transition occurs ( specific pairs of phases will be considered later in sec .",
    "[ sec : dc ] ) .",
    "the associated ground states are denoted as @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively . at low temperatures and near the transition point @xmath23 ( for @xmath70 ) , the finite - size partition function , @xmath18 ,",
    "can be expressed as a sum of two single - phase partition functions , leading to eq .   for @xmath18 .",

    "since a particle can be only added to @xmath51 ( removed from @xmath52 ) , in eq .   for @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) the first ( second ) term in @xmath82 is set equal to @xmath33 .",
    "the finite - size specific free energy @xmath7 of the model can be readily evaluated from eqs .   and .",

    "relations   and allows us to calculate an approximate value of the diffusion coefficient @xmath0 in the local equilibrium limit from the free energy @xmath7 .",
    "indeed , it suffices to find the derivatives @xmath84 hence , in combination with eq .",
    "that holds analogously also for derivatives of @xmath7 @xcite , the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath11 immediately follows .",
    "consequently , the coverage dependence of @xmath0 follows upon obtaining the inverse to @xmath85 and substituting it into @xmath86 , which can be easily carried out numerically .",
    "however , we can also derive explicit finite - size formulas for @xmath87 , starting from the @xmath11 dependences of @xmath1 , @xmath32 , and @xmath12 as yielded by eqs .   and .",
    "without loss of generality , we will assume that phase @xmath20 ( @xmath19 ) is stable for @xmath11 below ( above ) @xmath23 .",

    "yet another regime arises ; we call it a crossover regime",

    "since this equation is general and since the explicit expressions   for the single - phase free energies @xmath26 of model   will not be used in the derivation , the so obtained formulas for @xmath87 are of quite universal nature .",

    ", when these interactions were neglected so that @xmath13 was the probability of finding a vacant bond . nevertheless , our main results  formulas   and for @xmath87remain valid in the two - phase and single - phase regions also for the general version of @xmath13 given by eq .",
    "indeed , to obtain these formulas , we only used that @xmath13 was a sum of first derivatives of the free energy @xmath7 . in the simplest form of @xmath13",
    "these derivatives were @xmath1 and @xmath32 , the latter one being an example of such a derivative in general .",

    "therefore , since a general @xmath13 is a sum of such derivatives , its coverage dependence must also have the same form as in the simplest version considered in this paper . as a result",

    "even though the equation is true for a large class of models , its applicability to a particular model must be always verified , similarly to the low - temperature analysis described in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "moreover , it may be necessary to include additional terms in the model hamiltonian so that all of the parameters @xmath14 are present and the derivatives @xmath206 and @xmath211 can be obtained ( perhaps setting @xmath14 equal to zero in the end ) .    finally , note that the formula for @xmath87 in the two - phase regime , eq .",
