    "pringle ( 1981 ) pointed out that in present of viscosity , most of the matter of the disc accretes into the black hole while most of the angular momentum is taken farther away by very little matter .",
    "though this basic principle is the key to believe that the standard models of shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 , hereafter ss73 ) and novikov & thorne ( 1973 ) are possible , there are very few numerical simulations which actually show how a keplerian disc is formed , or whether it should always form .",
    "there are clearly two possibilities : when the companion supplies high angular matter ( as in a low mass x - ray binary ) , viscous stress must be very large to transport this in order that the accretion may occur .",
    "on the other hand , when mainly winds from the companion ( as in a high mass x - ray binary ) is accreted the flow need not produce a keplerian disc ( chakrabarti & titarchuk , 1995 , hereafter ct95 ; smith , heindl and swank , 2002 ) since the viscosity may not be high enough to transport angular momentum rapidly to redistribute the angular momentum .",
    "it has been shown by chakrabarti ( 1989 ) that low angular momentum , non dissipative flows produce axisymmetric standing shock waves in tens of schwarzschild radii , but the presence of a large viscosity ( chakrabarti , 1990 , hereafter c90 ) will remove the shock wave since the rankine - hugoniot relation is not be satisfied in a highly dissipative flow .",
    "a confirmation of such an assertion , originally made in the context of the isothermal flows , came both through numerical simulations ( chakrabarti & molteni , 1995 , hereafter cm95 ) as well as theoretical studies of flows with more general equation of states ( chakrabarti , 1996a , hereafter c96 ; chakrabarti & das , 2004 ; das & chakrabarti , 2004 ) .",
    "the theoretical works showed that the topology of the flow is modified when viscosity is added and beyond a critical viscosity , the centrifugal pressure supported shocks do not form .",
    "the numerical work of cm95 , which was based on the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) in a one dimensional flow , clearly demonstrated the transport of angular momentum by the viscosity .",
    "it showed that for low enough viscosity parameter @xmath0 ( ss73 ) , the standing shock continues to form .",
    "however , with the increase in viscosity , the shock weakens and moves outward .",
    "ultimately , for high enough viscosity the shock disappears .",
    "most interestingly , the post - shock subsonic flow acquires a keplerian distribution .",
    "thus , for high enough viscosity , the entire disc becomes subsonic and keplerian , the assumed condition for the shakura - sunyaev disc .",
    "igumenshchev et al .",
    "( 1996 ) studied two - dimensional flows but concentrated only the inner region of the disk , namely , the region less than @xmath1 .",
    "the main interest was to study the transonic nature of the flow just before the matter enters into the horizon .",
    "they find that a torus like structure forms close to the black hole and the angular momentum increases outward .",
    "lanzafame et al . (",
    "1998 ) carried out the sph simulation in a region with a radial extent of @xmath2 in two dimensions and concentrated on the shock formation .",
    "in particular , they showed that high viscosity can remove the shock waves from the accretion flows .",
    "however , sph method is often intrinsically dissipative and it was necessary to verify the behaviour with other simulation methods .",
    "igumenshchev et al .",
    "( 1998 ) used the finite difference method and allowed the heat generated by viscosity heating to be radiated away or absorbed totally .",
    "the computational box was up to @xmath3 , but the outer boundary condition was that of a near keplerian flow having no radial velocity .",
    "the inner boundary was kept at @xmath4 .",
    "thus the possibility of having a shock or the inner sonic point were excluded .",
    "the disc was found to be stable for very high viscosity parameter @xmath0 and less stable for lower @xmath0 .",
    "igumenshchev et al .",
    "( 2000 ) extended earlier work by studying the dependence on the polytropic index @xmath5 which varied from @xmath6 to @xmath7 as well as viscosity parameter @xmath0 and again found that the stability of the solutions depend on these parameters .",
    "so far , however , the fate of the solutions which include shocks have not been studied .",
    "the formation of shock required injection of very lower angular and low viscosity flows and the inner boundary must be inside @xmath8 in order that the inner sonic point is formed ( c89 ) . in giri et al .",
    "( 2010 , hereafter paper i ) , the results of standing and oscillating shock formations in inviscid flows was presented .",
    "we now extend this study by adding viscosity . the theoretical work discussed in c89 or chakrabarti ( 1996a )",
    "were carried out for a one dimensional flow since they required the sonic point analysis .",
    "for a two dimensional flow , a completely self - consistent theoretical solution is not possible .",
    "this is why a numerical simulation is necessary to answer the following questions : ( a ) are the conclusions based on theoretical considerations continue to remain valid for a two dimensional flow ?",
    "( b ) do the shocks survive for higher viscosity ? ( c ) how does the outflow rate depend on viscosity ?",
    "( d ) are all the components of the viscous stress important in a thick accretion flow ?",
    "( e ) under what condition does the keplerian flow form ?    in the next section ,",
    "we show how we introduce the viscosity into the grid - based finite difference method ( molteni , ryu & chakrabarti , 1996 ) .",
    "we consider both the cases , namely , when only the @xmath9 component is present , and when all the components , namely , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 components are present . in  3 & 4 , we present the methodology and the results of our simulation respectively .",
    "finally , in  5 , we draw concluding remarks .",
    "in what follows , we consider a two dimensional axisymmetric flow around a schwarzschild black hole . instead of using general relativity , we use the well known pseudo - newtonian potential prescribed by paczyski and wiita ( 1980 ) .",
    "we use the cylindrical polar coordinates ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) .",
    "the mass , momentum and energy conservation equations in a compact form using non - dimensional units are given in molteni , ryu & chakrabarti ( 1996 ; hereafter mrc96 ) .",
    "we use the mass of the black hole @xmath15 ( assumed to be ten solar mass in this paper ) , the velocity of light @xmath16 and the schwarzschild radius @xmath17 as the units of the mass , velocity and distance respectively .",
    "the equations governing the inviscid flow have been presented in ryu et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , mrc96 and paper i in great detail and we do not repeat everything here . in the conservative form ,",
    "the equations are given by , @xmath18 where the state vector is @xmath19 the flux functions are @xmath20 and the source function is @xmath21    here , energy density @xmath22 ( without potential energy ) is defined as , @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the mass density , @xmath5 is the adiabatic index , @xmath25 is the pressure , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the radial , azimuthal and vertical component of velocity respectively . in the case of an axisymmetric flow without viscosity , the equation for",

    "thus , @xmath63 . as we have chosen the axisymmetric case ,",

    "this is responsible for transporting angular momentum along the radial direction .",
    "the other components are assumed negligible .",
    "thus , considering only @xmath74 , the only viscous term which goes into the eq .",
    "@xmath75 is @xmath76}\\ ] ] @xmath77 where , @xmath78 here , @xmath79 is angular velocity and defined as @xmath80    it has long been suspected that the diffusion of angular momentum through an accretion flow is driven by turbulence .",
    "the @xmath81-model ( ss73 ) introduced a phenomenological shear stress into the equations of motion to model the effects of this turbulence .",
    "this shear stress is proportional to @xmath25 , the total pressure .",
    "this shear stress permits an exchange of angular momentum between neighbouring layers . using @xmath81 prescription , we can assume @xmath82 , where @xmath0 is a proportionality factor which need not be constant throughout the flow .",
    "this has been used in the simulations by cm95 and c96 . in eq .",
    "@xmath83 we put @xmath84 in the place of @xmath85 . in that case , the viscous term reduces to @xmath86    in case of thick accretion flow , all viscous stress could be significant in flow dynamics . assuming that the flow is thick @xmath87 , the @xmath0-prescription could be written as ( e.g. , igumenshchev et al .",
    "1996 ) as @xmath88 where , @xmath89 is constant of order 1 , @xmath90 is the adiabatic sound speed , and @xmath91^{1 \\over 2}\\ ] ] is the keplerian angular velocity .",
    "we carried out simulations using this value of @xmath51 and either the @xmath9 component of the viscous stress or all the components of the viscous term .",
    "we clearly find major differences in our results .",
    "these will be discussed below .",
    "note that , we used a different notation for the viscosity parameter to differentiate between cases where the shakura - sunyaev prescription ( eq .",
    "6 ) is used or when the definition ( 7 ) is used for coefficient of viscosity .",
    "it is to be noted that the heat generated by the viscous dissipation is assumed to be radiated away instantly .",
    "thus we do not consider any effect of the heating on the dynamics of the flow in the present paper .    in the literature , viscosity prescriptions other than those discussed here",
    "have also been tried out , especially when the shock is present .",
    "we followed also the prescription macfadyen & woosley ( 1999 ) where @xmath0 was assumed to be constant when @xmath92 while it is assumed to be scaled as @xmath93 in the pre - shock flow to reduce the shear .",
    "the result remains very similar to our present result .",
    "this is because the pre - shock flow , where @xmath92 , is cooler with a lower thermal pressure and thus the angular momentum transport rate is weaker . in the post - shock flow , due to high thermal pressure , the angular momentum transport rate is higher and our disk becomes similar to keplerian .",
    "thus a constant @xmath0 prescription plays a role similar to that in a keplerian disk .",
    "the setup of our simulation is the same as presented in paper i. we consider a viscous , axisymmetric flow in the pseudo - newtonian gravitational field of a point mass @xmath94 located at the centre in cylindrical coordinates @xmath95 $ ] .",
    "we assume that at infinity , the gas pressure is negligible and the energy per unit mass vanishes .",
    "we also assume that the gravitational field of the black hole can be described by paczyski & wiita ( 1980 ) , @xmath96 where , @xmath97 and the schwarzschild radius is given by @xmath98    we also assume a polytropic equation of state for the accreting ( or , outflowing ) matter , @xmath99 , where , @xmath33 and @xmath24 are the isotropic pressure and the matter density respectively , @xmath5 is the adiabatic index ( assumed to be constant throughout the flow , and is related to the polytropic index @xmath100 by @xmath101 ) and @xmath102 is related to the specific entropy of the flow @xmath103 . in all our simulations , we take @xmath104 .",
    "the computational box occupies one quadrant of the r - z plane with @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the incoming gas enters the box through the outer boundary ( which is , in reality , of a vertical cylinder in shape ) , located at @xmath107 .",
    "we have chosen the density of the incoming gas @xmath108 for convenience since , in the absence of self gravity and cooling , the density is scaled out , rendering the simulation results valid for any accretion rate .",
    "we supply the radial velocity @xmath109 , the sound speed @xmath90 ( i.e. , temperature ) of the flow at the boundary points .",
    "we take the boundary values of density from the standard vertical equilibrium solution ( chakrabarti , 1989 ) .",
    "we inject matter at the outer boundary along the z - axis .",
    "we consider only the first quadrant and use the reflection boundary condition on the equatorial plane and z - axis to obtain the solution in other quadrants . in order to mimic the horizon of the black hole at one schwarzschild radius , we placed an absorbing inner boundary at @xmath110 , inside which all material is completely absorbed into the black hole . for the background material , we consider of density @xmath111 having the sound speed ( or , temperature ) to be same as that of the incoming matter",
    "hence , the incoming matter has a pressure @xmath112 times larger than that of the background matter .",
    "this matter is put to avoid unphysical singularities caused by ` division by zero ' .",
    "this is washed out and replaced by the incoming matter withing a single dynamical time scale .",
    "the calculations were performed with @xmath113 cells , so each grid has a size of @xmath114 in units of the schwarzschild radius .",
    "the timescale of matter from the outer boundary is about @xmath115s as computed from the sum of @xmath116 over the entire radial grid , @xmath117 being averaged over @xmath118 vertical grids .",
    "all the simulations have been carried out assuming a stellar mass black hole @xmath119 .",
    "we carry out the simulations for several hundreds of dynamical time - scales . in reality",
    ", our simulation time corresponds to a few seconds in physical units .",
    "the conversion of out time unit to physical unit is @xmath120 , and thus the physical time for which the programme was run would scale with the mass of the black hole .",
    "the total variation diminishing ( tvd ) method that we use here was primarily developed to deal with fluid dynamics ( harten , 1983 ) . in the astrophysical context ,",
    "ryu et al . ( 1994 & 1996 ) developed the tvd scheme to study astrophysical flows around black holes .",
    "in paper i , the oscillation phenomena in accretion flows around black holes related to the qpo were reported .",
    "that study of an inviscid accretion flow around black hole showed that the shock location changes with the change of specific angular momentum @xmath121 and specific energy @xmath122 , both of which were constant . in the present situation of a viscous flow ,",
    "none of these is constant .",
    "recently , one dimensional solution for quasi - spherical viscous flow was investigated by lee , ryu & chattopadhyay ( 2011 ) who found that there are oscillatory propagating shocks moving outward when the viscosity is large enough .      as mentioned earlier , we chose the outer boundary of the simulation grid at @xmath123 . the specific angular momentum ( @xmath29 ) of the flow is chosen to be @xmath124 ( for comparison , we note that the marginally stable angular momentum is @xmath125 in this unit . ) and the specific energy ( @xmath126 ) of the flow at the equatorial plane ( @xmath127 ) is chosen to be @xmath128 .",
    "the radial velocity pointing to the origin is chosen to be constant in all heights @xmath129 .",
    "these injection parameters correspond to those of low angular momentum transonic flow solutions and are qualitatively different from those of earlier workers such as igumenshchev et al .",
    "( 1998 , 2000 ) since they mainly inject near keplerian flow with no radial velocity . from the energy of the flow",
    ", we obtain the sound speed at the equatorial plane to be @xmath130 .",
    "we employ an isothermal outer boundary condition ( mrc96 ) . in other words ,",
    "we take the same sound speed at all heights at the outer boundary .",
    "we add the @xmath131 viscous term in the non - viscous system as discussed earlier .",
    "we stop the simulation at @xmath132 seconds . this is more than three hundred times the dynamical time .",
    "thus , the solution has most certainly come out of the transient regime and started exhibiting solutions characteristics of its flow parameters .",
    "the simulation results will be discussed now .    in figs .",
    "1a and 1b , we compare the mach number and the specific angular momentum variations in the equatorial plane of the flow for various @xmath0 . to make the comparison meaningful ,",
    "all the runs were carried out up to @xmath132s .",
    "each result is obtained starting with an inviscid flow @xmath133 ( marked ) and then gradually increasing @xmath134 till the shock goes out of the grid and eventually disappears .",
    "the values of @xmath134 for which the curves are drawn are ( left to right in fig . 1a and bottom to top in fig .",
    "1b ) : @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath115 , @xmath140 respectively .",
    "the shock location shifts outward with viscosity exactly as predicted in c90 and c96 . for an inviscid flow ( @xmath141 )",
    ", the matter bounces back from the centrifugal barrier and flows outward near the equatorial plane .",
    "as viscosity is enhanced , the angular momentum is transported outward and hence specific angular goes up .",
    "the velocity goes down and density goes up .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "1b in the @xmath142 region .",
    "in this particular example , the shock disappears above @xmath143 , which is the critical value of @xmath134 here .",
    "since the grid boundary is at a finite distance in a numerical grid it is difficult of show the disappearance of the shock since that would require changing the boundary condition dynamically to let the shock through when it reached the boundary .",
    "the results are indeed similar to the results of cm95 where one dimensional viscous isothermal flow was treated using smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code .",
    "as described in c90 , the critical @xmath0 ( @xmath144 ) is defined by that specific @xmath0 for which the subsonic branch of the transonic flow solution passes through both the inner and outer sonic points .",
    "thus @xmath144 clearly depends on the injected flow parameters .",
    "hence , for a different choice of injected parameters , the critical value of @xmath134 will be different .",

    "however , it is not a pure triple - shock , since the matter flows from right to the left for both the shocks facing the upstream .",
    "as the matter flows in from the right hand side and passes through the shock , it becomes hot and puffs up as a thick accretion disc ( see also , molteni , lanzafame and chakrabarti , 1994 , hereafter mlc94 ) . the standing shock moves",

    "shocks close to the black hole exhibit lower amplitude and higher frequency oscillations while those farther out show opposite effects .",

    "the compression wave in the post - shock region bounces back from the centrifugal barrier and pushes the shock outward .",

    "most interestingly , for @xmath162 and @xmath163 , the oscillation of the shock disappears and standing shocks are formed while for other @xmath0s there are oscillations .",
    "this is not surprising , since , as was shown for the inviscid flow ( chakrabarti , 1989 ) as well as the viscous flow chakrabarti & das ( 2004 ) , the rankine - hugoniot relations are satisfied only in a limited region of the parameter space , and beyond the critical viscosity the relation not satisfied at all . in this case , the flow has two sonic points and the high entropy solution must pass through the inner sonic point ( c89 ) .",
    "hence , the flow generates entropy through a shock jump , but the location itself can not be fixed because the rankine - hugoniot condition is not satisfied .",

    "in this paper , we have presented the results of the numerical simulations of a two dimensional , axisymmetric , viscous accretion flows .",
    "three parameters , namely , the specific angular momentum , the specific energy and the viscosity parameter determine the complete solution , although results depend somewhat on the injection process at the outer boundary . while both inviscid ( chakrabarti , 1989 ) and viscous ( chakrabarti & das , 2004 ) flows allow solutions with or without centrifugal barrier dominated shock waves , we concentrated mostly on the cases when the shocks are formed .",
    "we find that the shocks move outward as the viscosity is enhanced and the post - shock region roughly attains a keplerian distribution .",
    "when the viscosity parameter is very high , the shock moves to a large distance and the whole disc becomes a keplerian disc .",
    "we also found that the condition of standing shock wave formation may be satisfied only in a narrow range of the viscous parameter ( keeping other parameters as constants ) which is in line with the conclusions drawn in chakrabarti & das ( 2004 ) .",
    "when the rankine - hugoniot conditions are not satisfied , the shocks tend to oscillate ( ryu , chakrabarti , molteni , 1997 ; paper i ) and the frequency of oscillation is decreased and the amplitude is increased as the shock moves out .",
    "in contrast to these simulations , the simulations of igumenshchev and collaborators ( 1996 , 1998 , 2000 ) concentrated on shock - free solutions .",
    "either the simulation boundary was too small or too big with high viscosity , the shocks did not form in these simulations .",
    "thus a direct comparison is not possible . in some of the models ( e.g. , ct95 ) the post - shock region or cenbol",
    "is treated as the compton cloud which plays a major role in shaping the spectrum of the accretion flows .",
    "similarly , the cenbol is thought to be responsible for the outflows . in chakrabarti ( 1999 )",
    "it was estimated that the ratio of the outflow to the inflow varies with the strength of the shock . in the present case , we varied the strength of the shock by increasing viscosity and found that the outflow rate , though fluctuating in small time scales , becomes smaller as the viscosity parameter is increased .    in paper",
    "i , we emphasized the formation of a weaker inner shock closer to the black hole .",
    "this was not predicted by the theoretical works . in the present paper",
    ", we find that this inner shock also becomes weaker and moves outward when the viscosity is introduced .",
    "the critical viscosity parameter for removal of the inner shock is lower than what is needed to remove the outer shock .    in molteni ,",
    "sponholz and chakrabarti ( 1996 ) and chakrabarti , acharyya & molteni ( 2004 ) it was shown that the shocks oscillated when the cooling time scale matches with the infall time scale .",
    "the simulation did not include viscosity . in ryu , chakrabarti and molteni ( 1997 )",
    "no cooling or viscosity was added , but the shocks were shown to oscillate when the rankine - hugoniot relation was not satisfied . in the present paper , for the first time , we show that even for a viscous flow , the same conclusion holds true as long as the viscosity is less than the critical value and the shocks are not totally removed .",
    "it is well known that the light curves of the radiation coming from an accretion disc around a black hole exhibit quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) .",
    "it appears that in the absence of a hard surface , the standing shock itself behaves like a hard surface and its oscillation changes the size of the post - shock region significantly .",
    "this could be the cause of the low and intermediate frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( chakrabarti & manickam , 2000 ; rodriguez et al .",
    "2004 ; remillard et al . 2006 ; gliozzi et al . 2010 ; qu et al .",
    "when the viscosity is increased , the keplerian rate is enhanced and at the same time , the shock recedes to a large distance and the time period is increased .",
    "asymptotically , this means that a keplerian disc should not show qpos .",
    "we also observe that away from the equatorial plane the angular momentum is sub - keplerian ( i.e. , smaller compared to the specific angular momentum on the equatorial plane ) . a picture similar to this",
    "has been postulated in the two component advective flow model ( ct95 ) where sub - keplerian flows flank a keplerian disc on a equatorial plane .",
    "however , a complete picture would emerge only after radiative transfer is added .",
