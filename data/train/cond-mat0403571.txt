    "ultracold bosons in an optical lattice provide a tunable quantum system with variance of the potential depth and lattice constant which can be achieved by adjusting the parameters of the configuration of laser beams .",
    "various quantum phenomena , for instance , bloch oscillations , wannier - stack ladders@xcite have been investigated in such a system which shares spatial periodicity with crystal lattice in solid state physics , however is immune from scattering of impurities or phonons .",
    "the superfluid - mott - insulator ( smi )  phase transition is one of the most significant quantum phenomena of condensate bosons in the optical lattice .",
    "a known analogous system exhibiting the smi phase transition is liquid helium with short - range repulsive interaction in periodic potential@xcite .",
    "the atomic gas in bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) subjected to the lattice potential which is turned on smoothly can be kept in the superfluid phase ( sfp ) as long as the repulsive interaction between atoms is small with respect to the tunnel coupling . with increasing of the potential depth of the optical lattice it is getting more and more difficult for bosons to tunnel from one site to the other , and",
    "finally the system attends an insulator phase above a critical value of the potential depth .",
    "considerable attention has been attracted to theoretical researches for understanding of the phase transition and determining of the transition condition@xcite-@xcite , in which the bose - hubbard model(bhm ) is introduced as the starting point of the theoretical studies@xcite .",
    "the phase transition phenomena have been also observed experimentally in bec loaded in a three dimensional optical lattice@xcite . using a strong coupling expansion in terms of the hopping term called the decoupling approximation , which is as a matter of fact based on the mean - field method d. van oosten et .",
    "al have obtained an analytic phase transition condition ( see the following eq.([condition ] ) ) . from an alternative viewpoint",
    "the phase transition condition can be also determined from the energy spectrum of the system since the excitation spectrum is neccesarily gapless for the sfp while has a finite gap for the mott insulator phase ( mip ) .",
    "we in the present paper use both the green function method and bogliubov approach to obtain the explicit excitation energy spectrum and hence to investigate the smi phase transition .",
    "we begin with the following second - quantized hamiltonian operator@xcite for the system of bosonic atoms in the optical lattice , @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the boson field operators which obey the boson commutation relation @xmath3 = \\delta \\left ( { \\bf x - x}% ^{\\prime } \\right ) \\text{.}\\ ] ] here @xmath4 @xmath5 is the potential of the optical lattice formed by the laser light of wavelength @xmath6 , and hence the lattice constant is @xmath7 .",

    "( [ high order ] ) into ( [ single green ] ) yields @xmath76 which is the equation for the site space green function @xmath77 .",
    "the green function @xmath77 is a function of the position difference ( @xmath78 ) of two sites only for a system with translational invariance .",
    "the equation ( [ site green ] ) for the green function @xmath77 can be solved with the fourier transformation . to this end",
    "we express the site space operator @xmath15 in terms of the wave - vector - space operator @xmath79    @xmath80    we can prove that the single particle green function in the bloch representation is orthogonal , i.e. ,    @xmath81    where @xmath82 @xmath83denotes the orthogonal green function in bloch representation .",
    "the fourier transformation of the green function @xmath77 is then seen to be    @xmath84    substituting eq.(22 ) into eq.(20 ) the single particle green function in the bloch representation is explicitly obtained as    @xmath85    rewrite the solution as the following form    @xmath86    where @xmath87 and @xmath88 denote the poles of the green function @xmath89 , and it is seen that the excitation spectrum possesses a band structure such as    @xmath90    the lowest band shrinks to a single level of zero band width ( see fig.1 ) . although the energy spectrum eq.([last result ] ) comprises two parts , they may , in a certain case depending on the relative values of the interatomic repulsion @xmath91 and the tunnel coupling @xmath27 , be merged into the same energy band . the energy gap between the two bands is [ fig.1 ]    @xmath92    when the constant of the interatomic repulsion @xmath91 is large with respect to the tunnel coupling @xmath27 such that @xmath93 , a gap exists implying the mip . with increasing of tunnel coupling @xmath27 the gap width @xmath94 decreases and finally the two energy bands in the excitation spectrum overlap and the gap disappears , indicating the sfp . we then obtain the condition of smi phase transition that    @xmath95    , namely , @xmath96 which agrees with the result in refs.@xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite .    to see the sfp more closely we take the zero wave vector limit of the energy band @xmath88 ( @xmath97    @xmath98 under the condition eq.([condition ] )",
    "at which the energy gap between @xmath99 and @xmath88 disappears , we have a gapless goldstone mode in the excitation spectrum such as    @xmath100    which is different from the result of bogoliubov theory for the system of weakly interacting bosons , in the absence of the periodic potential , where the wave vector dependence of the excitation spectrum is linear in the zero wave vector limit so that a non - vanishing velocity can exist . strictly speaking",
    "what we obtained here is an ordinary fluid phase .",
    "the energy spectrum of eq.(25 ) determined with the help of green function method is too simple to realize the superfluid phase explicitly .",
    "this may be due to the particular procedure of the approximation used in the above derivation .",
    "it is certainly of interest to study the spectrum of bosonic atoms in the bec trapped in the optical lattice in terms of bogliubov method to see weather or not the system can possess a superfluid phase which we are going to discuss in the next section .",
    "it is worth while to point out that when the interaction between bosons vanishes @xmath16.e .",
    "@xmath101 , the green function eq.([result1 ] ) reduces to the well known single band solution    @xmath102    for bosons in a periodic potential .",
    "now we study the energy spectrum of boson atoms in the optical lattice by means of the bogliubov method . using the relation([transform ] ) the hamiltonian([hamiltonian1 ] ) can be converted to @xmath103    @xmath104    since the number of atoms condensed in the zero - momentum state is much larger than one , we have @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the total number of condensed atoms .",
    "thus we can replace the operator @xmath107 and @xmath108 by a ",
    "@xmath109 number @xmath110 . the interacting part of the hamiltonian ( [ interation2 ] ) can be written as ( in the order of @xmath106 )    @xmath111 and the total hamiltonian is    @xmath112    where @xmath113denotes the sum with exclusion of the term of @xmath114 .",
    "the following bogoliubov transformation is introduced in order to diagonalize the hamiltonian([hamiltonian3 ] )    @xmath115    we require that the quasi - boson operators @xmath116 and @xmath117 satisfy the usual commutation relation , @xmath118 , @xmath119=1 $ ] , which leads to the condition    @xmath120    for the coefficients @xmath121 and @xmath122 and then the hamiltonian can be written as    @xmath123 where    @xmath124    is a constant and    @xmath125    @xmath126    to eliminate the off - diagonal part @xmath127 we require    @xmath128    where @xmath129 introducing a parameter @xmath130 such that    @xmath131 the conditions ( [ nomalization ] ) , ( [ calcellation ] ) lead to the useful relations    @xmath132    @xmath133 with which the diagonalized hamiltonian is obtained as @xmath134 where the energy spectrum @xmath135 of quasi - particle is    @xmath136    the energy spectrum is different from that of eq.(25 ) and is typical for the superfluid .",
    "the energy gap @xmath137 of excitation spectrum is obviously    @xmath138    the phase transition condition determined from @xmath139 is    @xmath140    which shows a factor 2 difference comparing with the condition in eq.([condition ] ) .",
    "this may be caused by the approximation itself .",
    "when the energy gap disappears , i.e. @xmath139 , the dispersion relation of @xmath135(@xmath141 reads    @xmath142    indicating explicitly the superfluididy in agreement with the bogliubov superfluid theory for weakly interacting bosons in the absence of the periodic potential .",
    "the linear wave vector dependence of the excitation spectrum @xmath135 ( unlike the ordinary fluid eq.(28 ) where @xmath143 is proportional to @xmath144 ) is the characteristic of the sperfluid which gives rise to a persistent velocity of superfluid or quasi - particle found as @xmath145 for the case of boson atoms with repulsive interaction(@xmath146 ) , the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath91 are positive , @xmath147 is a real number which implies a persistent current .",
    "the velocity @xmath147 can be controlled by the tuning of laser lights which result in the optical lattice . as seen from the definitions ( [ j ] ) , ( [ u ] ) for @xmath27 and @xmath91 , these parameters both depend on the wannier functions which are essentially determined by the potential of optical lattice",
    ". therefore @xmath27 and @xmath91 are not independently tunable by the adjusting of the laser parameters .",
    "in fact when the depth of the lattice potential increases , the hopping matrix element @xmath27 decreases exponentially while the matrix- element of the on - site interaction , @xmath91 , increases .",
    "we thereby expect that there exists a maximum value of the persistent velocity @xmath147 in some particular values of @xmath27 and @xmath91 .",
    "we have studied the bose - hubbard model of bec trapped in a periodic potential in terms of green function method and bogliubov transformation as well .",
    "the condition of phase transition between sfp and mip is determined by the energy band structure of the excitation spectrum due to , obviously , the competition between the interatomic repulsion and the tunnel coupling .",
    "our result agrees with the condition of smi phase transition obtained in literature .",
    "the sfp property of bec in the optical lattice is explained explicitly from energy spectrum derived by means of the bogliubov approach .",
    "it is shown that the persistent velocity of the quasi - particle in sfp can be tuned by the adjusting of the laser lights which result in the optical lattice .",
