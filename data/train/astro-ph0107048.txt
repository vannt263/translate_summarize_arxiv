    "it has long been known that the comoving number density of radio sources increases with redshift .",
    "evidence for a subsequent decline in the comoving density of low luminosity radio galaxies at @xmath8 was presented by windhorst ( 1984 ) . at high luminosities , peacock ( 1985 ) concluded that there was a reduction in the comoving density of compact , flat - spectrum ( @xmath9 , where @xmath10 ) , radio - loud quasars at @xmath11 .",
    "dunlop & peacock ( 1990 , hereafter dp90 ) extended that study to lower radio luminosities and steep - spectrum sources , and presented evidence that there is also a peak at @xmath12 in the density of both steep - spectrum quasars and radio galaxies .",
    "however the reality of the decline or ` cut - off ' in the radio luminosity function ( rlf ) at high redshift ( which _ can not _ be due to dust obscuration , for example ) has been challenged following the discovery of radio galaxies at @xmath13 ( e.g. , spinrad , dey , & graham 1995 ; van breugel et  al .",
    "although limited by small - number statistics , jarvis et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) find that the comoving number density of the most powerful ( @xmath14  w  hz@xmath1  sr@xmath1 ) steep - spectrum sources remains constant between @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    the best way to settle this uncertainty is to determine the redshift distribution of a complete sample of radio galaxies selected at a flux - density limit of @xmath17  mjy .",
    "this limit is sufficiently _ faint _ that , if there is no redshift cut - off , a large fraction of the sources must lie at high redshifts , and yet sufficiently _ bright _ that objects selected at this flux density are still predominantly classical radio galaxies rather than low - redshift starbursts @xcite .",
    "the leiden - berkeley deep survey ( lbds ) consists of nine high - latitude fields in the selected areas sa28 , sa57 , sa68 and an area in hercules .",
    "they were surveyed with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope at 1.41  ghz , reaching a 5-@xmath18 limiting flux density of 1  mjy ( windhorst , van heerde & katgert 1984a ) .",
    "optical counterparts to the radio sources were found using multi - colour prime focus photographic plates of the fields , taken with the kitt peak 4-m mayall telescope .",
    "identifications were found for 53% of the sources in the full survey , whilst for the hercules field 47 out of 72 sources were identified ( windhorst , kron & koo 1984b ; kron , koo & windhorst 1985 ) .    the hercules field was subsequently observed with the 200-inch hale telescope at palomar observatory between 1984 and 1988 ( waddington et  al .",
    "2000 , hereafter paper  i ) .",
    "multiple observations were made through gunn @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 filters over six observing runs .",
    "after processing and stacking of the multiple - epoch images , optical counterparts for 22 of the sources were found , leaving only three sources unidentified to @xmath22  mag .",
    "near - infrared observations have been made of the entire hercules sample at @xmath23 , yielding 60 ( of 72 ) detections down to @xmath2421  mag .",
    "half of the sources have been observed in @xmath25 and approximately one - third in @xmath26 ( paper  i ) .",
    "prior to the work reported here , approximately half of the sample had spectroscopic redshifts , which were summarised in table  4 of paper  i. in this paper , we present additional redshift measurements together with photometric redshift estimates , and then investigate the redshift distribution of the sample .    the layout of the paper is as follows . in section  2",
    "we present the results of our most recent efforts to obtain optical spectra of the radio sources with the william herschel telescope . in section  3",
    "we describe the methods that we used to calculate photometric redshifts for the 22 sources for which we do not have a spectroscopic measurement .",
    "the complete redshift distribution ( spectroscopic plus photometric ) is then discussed .",
    "finally , in section  4 we compare the redshift distribution of this millijansky sample with the predictions of the model radio luminosity functions of dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ) , and reconsider the evidence for a redshift cut - off in the rlf . for consistency with earlier papers ,",
    "unless otherwise stated , a cosmology with @xmath27  km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 is assumed .",
    "observations of 7 faint red radio galaxies in the lbds hercules sample were obtained with the isis spectrograph at the 4.2-m william herschel telescope ( wht ) at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos , la palma , on 1995 june 2124 .",
    "on 1997 june 30  july 3 , a further 22 sources were observed with isis at the wht , using the same configuration .",
    "isis is a double - beam spectrograph ",
    "light from the slit is split by a dichroic at 6100   , with the blue and red light going into separate channels where the optical coatings and ccd detectors have been sensitised to blue and red wavelengths respectively . using the r158b & r158r gratings ,",
    "the total wavelength coverage was 31609060    with a dispersion of 2.9    pixel@xmath1 .",
    "each observation consisted of between one and six exposures of 1800  s each on the radio galaxy , giving a total integration time of 0.53 hours per target .",
    "the spectra were initially processed online throughout the night , enabling us to move to the next target as soon as sufficient signal was obtained to determine a redshift .",
    "the targets were acquired by blind - offsetting from a nearby star , which was also used to determine the expected position of the source on the ccd .",
    "spectrophotometric standards were observed at the start of each night .",
    "arc spectra , tungsten flat - fields and twilight sky flat - fields were taken at the start and end of each night .",
    "the data were reduced using standard techniques .",
    "after bias subtraction and flat - fielding , the one - dimensional spectrum was extracted with the noao spectroscopy package apextract .",
    "an aperture of 3  arcsec was usually sufficient to contain the whole object , while keeping the sky to a minimum .",
    "sky apertures of 59  arcsec width were defined on each side of the object aperture . for strong continuum sources ,",
    "the object could be traced along the full length of the dispersion axis with a low - order ( @xmath30 ) polynomial , and this trace was used to extract the spectrum . for sources with poor continuum signal ,",
    "an adjacent observation of an offset or standard star was used to define the trace . for the spectra with the strongest continuum we used optimal extraction , where the pixels were weighted by their variance , but for fainter sources the spectrum",
    "was simply added across the spatial axis . for the very faintest targets (",
    "particularly some observed in the 1995 run ) we used figaro s polysky application to perform a two - dimensional sky subtraction , and then searched for line or continuum emission in the image without extracting a one - dimensional spectrum .",
    "removal of the atmospheric absorption features in the red channel of the spectrum was performed using observations of the early - type star g138@xmath3131a .",
    "each object spectrum was calibrated by first correcting for extinction , and then multiplying by a sensitivity function calculated from observations of the spectrophotometric standard star bd@xmath3233@xmath332642 .",
    "finally , the calibrated blue and red spectra were combined by taking the mean of the 32-  overlap region .",
    "the calibrations were tested at this stage by applying them to the standard star observations , and examining the quality of the joint at 6100   .",
    "there was a small discontinuity of about 8% between the blue and red fluxes across the joint of the standard stars .",
    "however , this level of photometric accuracy was quite sufficient for this project which was concerned with measuring redshifts rather than accurate fluxes .",
    ".redshifts and individual line identifications for the 11 lbds hercules sources observed at the wht.[linelist ] [ cols=\"^,^,<,^ \" , ]     for those sources which have an upper limit to the redshift based on a continuum detection in the spectrum ( table  [ speclimits ] ) , this limit was incorporated into the determination of @xmath34 and the errors .",
    "in fact , the spectroscopic continuum limit modified the estimated redshift of only one source , 53w070 , ruling out a high-@xmath35 minimum in @xmath36  at @xmath37 .    it can be seen in figure  [ herclikelihood ] that several of the sources have two or more distinct peaks in their redshift likelihood function .",
    "we generally adopted the most probable redshift ( highest peak ) unless the alternative redshift was more consistent with the @xmath23@xmath35 or @xmath20@xmath35 relation for the hercules spectroscopic sample . in this way we have chosen the second highest peak in @xmath38 to be the correct photometric redshift for two sources : 53w042 and 53w061 . with an @xmath20-band magnitude of 25.7  mag ( paper i ) , the ` peak ' at zero redshift for 53w042 can not possibly correspond to the true redshift of this source ;",
    "the alternative of @xmath39 is prefered .",
    "53w061 was identified as a probable quasar @xcite and with @xmath40 the alternative redshift of 2.88 ( with @xmath41 ) seems more reasonable than @xmath42 ( with @xmath43 ) .",
    "the redshift distribution of the lbds hercules sources is presented in figure  [ herczhistograms ] , for both the full sample and the 2-mjy sample . in this figure",
    "the photometric redshifts from table  [ photztable ] have been combined with the spectroscopic redshifts from table  [ linelist ] here and table  3 of paper  i. the numbers have been appropriately weighted to correct for the detection biases in the radio data ( see paper  i ) .",
    "the median redshift of the full sample is 0.61 , and for the 2-mjy sample it is 0.80 . comparing these results with fainter radio surveys at sub - millijansky and microjansky flux density limits , it is seen that the redshift distribution changes very little over more than two orders of magnitude in radio flux @xcite . in particular ,",
    "radio observations of the hubble deep field down to 9  @xmath44jy result in a very similar distribution to figure  [ herczhistograms](b ) , with a mean redshift of @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "recall that there are three sources in the hercules sample that are unidentified and therefore do not appear in the redshift distributions ( paper  i ) .",
    "53w043 was obscured by a bright star in the 4-shooter  ccd observations , but a limit of @xmath46  mag was obtained from the photographic plates .",
    "this places a lower limit on its redshift of @xmath47 .",
    "the other two unidentified sources ( 53w0037 & 53w0087 ) both have @xmath48  mag , placing them at @xmath492 . with a combined weight of 3.7",
    ", these three sources will not significantly change the distribution but will likely extend the high - redshift tail when they are finally identified .",
    "we calculate an upper limit to the median redshift of the whole 72-source sample of 0.63 and an upper limit of 1.09 for the 2-mjy sample , taking into account these unidentified sources .    in figure  [ fluxlimits ]",
    "we compare the flux density limits of the lbds with those of the parkes selected regions ( psr ; dunlop et  al.1989 ) and 3cr @xcite surveys .",
    "it can be seen how the lbds can be used to : ( i ) probe the faint end of the rlf out to much greater redshifts than the brighter surveys ; and ( ii ) detect powerful radio galaxies out to very high redshifts ( @xmath50 ) . with a flux density limit of @xmath51  mjy ,",
    "the lbds is @xmath52100 times fainter than the psr used by dp90 . in the psr sample ,",
    "only the most powerful ( @xmath53 ) sources are detectable at @xmath54 .",
    "the lbds can detect sources at the same redshift which have luminosities of @xmath55  such sources are below the flux density limit of the psr for any redshift @xmath56 .",
    "if there is not a high - redshift cut - off in the rlf , then there will be a significant fraction of sources in the lbds at high redshifts .",
    "for example , figure  14(b ) of dp90 predicts the cumulative redshift distribution for the whole lbds sample based on their rlf models .",
    "as many as 10% of the sources may have redshifts greater than 3 according to the models , although the predicted distribution was rather poorly constrained beyond @xmath57 .",
    "this ability of the lbds to confirm or refute the cut - off was one of the motivations to complete the optical identification of the lbds and to obtain redshifts for as many sources as possible .",
    "the lack of sources at @xmath58 in figure  [ fluxlimits ] is striking , and clearly suggests that there is indeed a redshift cut - off in the rlf . in the next section , we quantify this statement and compare the data with the models of dp90 .",
    "in an extension of work begun by peacock & gull ( 1981 ) and peacock ( 1985 ) , dp90 investigated the evolution of the 2.7-ghz radio luminosity function , with an emphasis on the behaviour of the rlf at high redshift .",
    "their method was to find a model ( or rather , an ensemble of models ) of the luminosity function @xmath59 , that was consistent with all the available data . in those regions of the @xmath60@xmath35 plane where the redshift content of the data was high , generally corresponding to the higher flux densities ,",
    "the model was well defined .",
    "the model was then extrapolated across the rest of the @xmath60@xmath35 plane , subject to the constraints of less direct data such as source counts .",
    "of course , it is known that the real universe is not smooth on all scales , so the models will only be approximations to the actual form of the rlf .",
    "the data were drawn from four complete samples at a frequency of 2.7-ghz , together with source counts at fainter flux limits and measurements of the local rlf .",
    "the deepest of these samples was the parkes selected regions ( downes et  al .",
    "1986 ; dunlop et  al.1989 ) , with a flux density limit of 0.1  jy and containing 178 sources ( including a higher proportion of steep - spectrum sources than the other samples ) .",
    "however , only 46% of the psr sources had redshifts , so dp90 used the empirical @xmath23@xmath35 relation of lilly , longair & allington - smith ( 1985 ) to estimate the redshifts of the remaining 54% of the data .",
    "the ensemble of model rlfs consisted of five ` free - form ' and two parametric models that were found to be consistent with the data .",
    "the free - form models ( here denoted by ff-1 , @xmath61 , ff-5 ) are forth- or fifth - order series expansions in @xmath62 and @xmath35 , with various forms of high - redshift cut - off imposed on the models .",
    "each of these models was derived twice , using two different estimated redshift distributions ( denoted by ` mean - z ' and ` high - z ' ) .",
    "dp90 also fitted their data with two simple parametric models : pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) and a combination of luminosity and density evolution ( lde ) .",
    "the ple luminosity function was modelled as the sum of a low - power non - evolving component ( a sixth - order polynomial in @xmath62 ) and a high - power evolving component ( a double power - law in @xmath63 , with a break luminosity parameterized as a quadratic function of @xmath35 ) .",
    "the lde model was a modification of ple , in which the space density was allowed to vary with redshift directly , in order to investigate the possibility that the cut - off was due to negative density evolution while the positive luminosity evolution continued at @xmath11 .",
    "for the flat - spectrum population , a decline in the rlf at high redshifts ( @xmath11 ) is required by the models for all luminosities where the complete sample database has good coverage of the @xmath60@xmath35 plane ( the strength of this result is due to the nearly complete redshift data for the flat - spectrum population ) . for the steep - spectrum sources ,",
    "a cut - off is _ required _ for the most luminous objects ( @xmath64 ) at @xmath11 , and it is _ consistent _ with the data at all luminosities .",
    "this was the first time that a high-@xmath35 cut - off in the rlf had been quantified in the steep - spectrum population , although it had also been suggested by the observations of windhorst ( 1984 ) .",
    "dp90 also performed a model - independent test of the cut - off using the banded @xmath65  test @xcite . for a uniform distribution of objects in space ,",
    "the mean @xmath66 should be 0.5 .",
    "the banded @xmath65  test is a function of redshift and enables any high - redshift negative evolution to be separated from the strong , positive evolution at lower redshifts . applying this test to their complete sample database",
    "gave values @xmath67 , on average , for the flat - spectrum sources at @xmath8 and for the steep - spectrum sources at @xmath68 , indicating a deficit of high - redshift objects . at lower redshifts ,",
    "values of @xmath69 clearly demonstrated the strong positive evolution of both the steep- and flat - spectrum populations at @xmath70 .",
    "the models of dp90 were used to extrapolate the rlf to lower radio luminosities and higher redshifts than were sampled by their data .",
    "in fact the models predict the form of the rlf over the whole of the @xmath60@xmath35 plane illustrated in figure  [ fluxlimits ] .",
    "thus we can use the lbds hercules sample to test the reality of the redshift cut - off found by dp90 .",
    "as we discussed in paper i , the large weights of the nine sources with @xmath71  mjy causes the full sample to be biased towards these low signal - to - noise objects . throughout this section ,",
    "therefore , only the 63 sources with @xmath72  mjy ( i.e.  the ` 2-mjy sample ' ) will be considered .",
    "two approaches have been used in order to compare the predictions with the hercules data .",
    "first , the model luminosity functions were used to calculate the expected redshift distribution in the hercules field , in the form of cumulative number counts .",
    "second , the space density of sources in the sample was calculated as a function of radio luminosity and redshift , to compare directly with the models .",
    "this second method has the advantage that the luminosity dependence can be investigated directly , but with only 63 sources in the sample ( of which three have no optical counterpart ) the sampling and statistics are quite poor .",
    "the first method allows more robust conclusions to be drawn , but at the expense of losing the luminosity information .",
    "dp90 divided their data according to spectral index ( @xmath73 , where @xmath10 ) , and calculated model rlfs for the steep - spectrum ( @xmath74 ) and flat - spectrum ( @xmath75 ) populations separately . for their complete samples , spectral indices were known for all sources .",
    "however , the data from the fainter samples were generally restricted to source counts , with no spectral index information available . to separate the faint number counts into steep- and flat - spectrum sources , they approximated the flat - spectrum contribution by a model , @xmath76 $ ]  jy@xmath1  sr@xmath1 , which was then subtracted off the data to give the steep - spectrum counts .",
    "these number counts were incorporated into the respective rlf models of the two populations .",
    "it became apparent during the current work that this model for the flat - spectrum contribution at faint flux densities was incorrect .",
    "the number of steep - spectrum sources in the hercules data is significantly lower than the rlf models predicted , and conversely there are more flat - spectrum sources in the data than in the models .",
    "the predicted total number of sources ( steep- plus flat - spectrum ) agreed with the data , as it should .",
    "in particular , dp90 s model for @xmath77 predicts that there should be 510 flat - spectrum sources in the 2-mjy sample , where there are actually 29 of them ( after applying the weights for incompleteness ) .",
    "in fact , the ratio of steep - spectrum to flat - spectrum sources is the same in both the psr and 2-mjy hercules samples , at approximately 2@xmath78:@xmath781 ( see also windhorst et  al .  1993 ; richards 2000 ) .",
    "we therefore removed the distinction between flat - spectrum and steep - spectrum sources altogether .",
    "the data were considered as a single population , and the models were simply added together .",
    "mathematically , this is possible as the rlf models are essentially the number of sources observed in the survey , which can of course be summed .",
    "physically , this is justified by the work of several authors .",
    "one of the main conclusions of dp90 was that both populations behave very similarly and may therefore come from a single population .",
    "padovani & urry ( 1992 ) demonstrated that steep- and flat - spectrum radio quasars and fr - ii radio galaxies were consistent with being the same physical objects , viewed at different angles and with a range of relativistic beaming parameters ( see also urry & padovani  1995 ) .",
    "thus in the remainder of this paper we consider a single radio luminosity function for sources of all spectral indices .",
    "the cumulative number counts are calculated for each of the rlfs : five free - form models , ple and lde .",
    "the total number of sources at redshifts less than @xmath35 is : @xmath79 \\left ( { { { \\rm d}v}\\over{{\\rm d}z } }          \\right ) { \\rm d}z \\label{nlessthanz}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is the luminosity of a source at redshift @xmath35 whose flux density would be equal to the detection limit of @xmath81  mjy .",
    "this projected flux density limit at 2.7  ghz is derived from the flux density limit of the survey at 1.4  ghz ( i.e.  2.0  mjy ) using the median spectral index of sources in the sample , @xmath82 , defined over 0.61.4  ghz ( paper  i ) .",
    "equation  [ nlessthanz ] was evaluated numerically in steps of @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the volume element is @xmath85 \\psi$ ] , where the comoving volume of the universe ( in mpc@xmath86  sr@xmath1 ) out to redshift @xmath35 is @xmath87 , and @xmath88  sr ( or 1.22  deg@xmath89 ) is the solid angle of the sample @xcite .",
    "the results are plotted in figure  [ cumz1 ] .",
    "the observed cumulative redshift distribution was computed by summing the weights of the sources from @xmath90 to the redshift of each source in turn .",
    "we made a conservative calculation of the uncertainty in this distribution by assuming that all the photometric redshifts were simultaneously at their @xmath91-@xmath18 errors ( shaded area in figure  [ cumz1 ] ) .",
    "five of the models correctly predict the total number of sources in the sample , to within 5% .",
    "the weighted number of sources is 81.4 , of which 3.7 are unidentified and do not appear in the figure , and the models predict @xmath92 .",
    "the other two models ( ff-1 and ff-2 ) converge to @xmath93 by @xmath94 .",
    "the best agreement with the data is obtained for free - form models ff-4 and ff-5 . at @xmath95 and @xmath96",
    "they follow the observed distribution closely .",
    "the only disagreement occurs over the range @xmath97 , where the observed redshift distribution rises more rapidly than the models .",
    "this rise is due to two peaks in the observed redshift distribution ",
    "there are seven sources at @xmath98 and five sources at @xmath99 in the 2-mjy sample ( plus another source at @xmath100 with @xmath101  mjy ) .",
    "these two peaks indicate the existence of large - scale structures ( sheets ) intersecting the line - of - sight .",
    "we suggest that these radio sources may be part of two super - clusters ( their comoving transverse separation is @xmath102  mpc ) , statistical variations that the rlf models could not possibly predict .    with these exceptions ,",
    "models ff-4 and ff-5 provide a good description of the lbds hercules data . recall that the difference between each of the free - form models lies in the form of the high - redshift cut - off .",
    "although these two models are very similar in their predictions , they were defined somewhat differently . a high-@xmath35 cut - off was enforced on ff-5 such that the rlf decays sinusoidally from @xmath103 to a value of zero at @xmath104 . for ff-4",
    ", the model was similarly constrained to a value of zero at @xmath104 , but the form of the cut - off was not specified ( beyond being smooth and continuous ) .",
    "the other five models all fit the observed distribution at low redshifts , @xmath105 , where they were relatively well - constrained by the local rlf , but at high-@xmath35 they fail to match the data ( figure  [ cumz1 ] ) .",
    "the second free - form ( ff-2 ) , pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) and luminosity / density evolution ( lde ) models in particular , predicted that a much greater proportion of the sources would have large redshifts . using a preliminary version of this sample , dunlop ( 1997 ) found that the ple and lde models were consistent with the high - redshift ( @xmath106 ) distribution of the data .",
    "however with the additional spectroscopic and photometric redshifts now available , we see that these models show a large disagreement with the data over lower redshifts , @xmath107 .",
    "this is primarily due to the fact that the improved sed - based redshift estimation procedure used here has proven that the redshifts for many sources were previously over - estimated on the basis of the @xmath108 relation for powerful radio galaxies .",
    "the first of the free - form models ( ff-1 ) approximately follows the redshift distribution from @xmath90 to @xmath109 , however the number of sources at higher redshifts is @xmath5215% too low .",
    "the third of the free - form models ( ff-3 ) is in reasonable agreement with the data for redshifts @xmath110 , but then continues to rise steeply .",
    "it predicts that there should be only five sources at @xmath54 , which is inconsistent with the data as there are already ten sources with spectroscopic redshifts greater than this .",
    "figure  [ cumz1 ] has shown which models correctly predict the overall redshift dependence of the radio luminosity function , but it says nothing about the luminosity dependence . to investigate this",
    ", we calculated the observed rlf to compare directly with the models .",
    "this was done by redshift and luminosity binning of the 2-mjy hercules data .",
    "the luminosity of each source at 2.7  ghz ( the frequency at which the rlf models are defined ) was calculated from the observed flux at 1.4  ghz and the 0.61.4  ghz spectral index .",
    "eight luminosity bins were used , from @xmath111 to 28 in steps of @xmath112 .",
    "five redshift bins were used , from @xmath90 to 4 , centred on @xmath113 , 0.5 , 1.1 , 1.7 and 3.0 .",
    "these redshifts approximately correspond to ages of 90% , 50% , 33% , 25% and 10% of the current age of the universe ( for an einstein - de  sitter cosmology where @xmath114 ) .",
    "the bins were chosen so as to contain enough sources to be statistically useful , while being sufficiently narrow to resolve the redshift dependence of the rlf .",
    "the binned luminosity function is presented in figure  [ rlfdata ] . while the small number of sources is the weakness of this method of analysing the data",
    ", its strength lies in the accuracy with which the luminosities are known , given the effectively complete redshift information for the sample .",
    "given the relatively large width of the redshift bins , an additional weight had to be applied to each source to correct for the fact that the weakest sources could not have been detected at all redshifts within the bin .",
    "specifically , each weight was scaled by @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the comoving volume enclosed by the bin extending from redshift @xmath117 to @xmath118 , and @xmath119 is the volume enclosed from @xmath117 to the redshift @xmath120 at which the source would fall below the radio flux density limit of the sample ( clearly if @xmath121 then this weighting was unnecessary ) .",
    "errors were assigned to each bin on the basis of poisson counting statistics , applied to the raw weighted counts before correcting for the flux - density - limit bias .",
    "it is seen in figure  [ rlfdata ] that the observed low - redshift rlf evolves more slowly at low luminosities than it does at the higher luminosities studied by dp90 .",
    "it is not until @xmath47 that we see significant evolution in the luminosity bins . at @xmath122 , the density of sources at @xmath123 ( triangles in figure  [ rlfdata ] )",
    "is reduced by an order of magnitude from that in the lower redshift bin at @xmath124 ( stars ) .",
    "note that this may be due to incompleteness at the survey limit , but that is unlikely  we showed in paper  i that the sample is effectively complete once the appropriate weights have been applied to the sources .",
    "there is no evidence for a declining rlf at the same redshift ( @xmath123 ) in the next luminosity bin ( @xmath125 ) , suggesting that the cut - off redshift is a function of the radio luminosity .",
    "one of the most significant features in figure  [ rlfdata ] is the behaviour of the high - redshift radio luminosity function ( encircled crosses ) .",
    "all three points defining the rlf at @xmath106 lie below those of the same luminosities ( @xmath12627 ) at @xmath127 .",
    "in particular , the density of sources with @xmath125 decreases by a factor of six between @xmath128 and 3.0 .",
    "the decline at a luminosity of @xmath129 appears to be less dramatic and is of low formal significance due to there being just a single source at @xmath128 at this luminosity .",
    "it can be seen that the density has dropped by a factor of ten between @xmath123 and 3.0 over this same luminosity interval .",
    "we conclude from our direct binning of the rlf that the comoving density of low - luminosity radio sources begins to decline at redshifts @xmath130 and that the actual redshift of the turnover may depend on the radio luminosity .    in figure  [ rlfcompare ]",
    "we compare the observed luminosity function with the two model rlfs of dp90 which correctly predicted the redshift distribution of the sample , i.e.  free - form models ff-4 & ff-5 . at the lowest redshifts ,",
    "@xmath131 ( squares , solid lines in figure  [ rlfcompare ] ) , the model rlfs are consistent with the data within their errors . at a redshift of @xmath132 ( stars , dash - dot - dot - dot lines )",
    "both models predict too many sources at @xmath13323 and too few at @xmath13426 , although the data differ from the models by only a few sigma . at @xmath135 ( triangles , dashed lines ) the data and models are in reasonable agreement at @xmath136 , but there are significantly fewer low luminosity ( @xmath13724 ) sources than predicted .",
    "it is the behaviour of the rlf at the highest redshifts that is crucial for measuring the redshift cut - off .",
    "both the free - form models ff-4 and ff-5 are consistent with the data at @xmath138 ( filled circles , dotted lines in figure  [ rlfcompare ] ) , within their two - sigma error bounds .",
    "it is seen that at this redshift the model rlfs begin to decline for sources with luminosities @xmath139 , although the observed rlf does not change significantly from @xmath124 to 1.7 at these luminosities .",
    "the redshift cut - off of dp90 is clearly seen in the highest - redshift bin in figure  [ rlfcompare](b ) and is even more prominent in figure  [ rlfcompare](a ) .",
    "the comoving density of radio sources at @xmath140 is predicted to decline by as much as two orders of magnitude from @xmath138 .",
    "however , the data do not fall off nearly as rapidly as the models .",
    "model ff-5 is closer to the observed rlf than model ff-4 in this high - redshift regime , and is consistent with the data at the two - sigma level .",
    "we noted above that with an average of four sources per binned data point in figures  [ rlfdata ] & [ rlfcompare ] , the statistics are quite poor and the data do not differentiate between the models to a significant degree .",
    "however , we have shown that the two models which best fit the observed redshift distribution of the sample are at least consistent with the luminosity dependence of the observed rlf .      following dp90 , we applied the banded @xmath65  test to the hercules sample in order to investigate the redshift cut - off in a model independent manner .",
    "this is a variation of the original @xmath65  test @xcite , that has been modified to test the evolution of the sample for redshifts greater than some fixed value @xmath142 .",
    "we define @xmath143 as the comoving volume enclosed by a source at redshift @xmath35 ( @xmath144 ) , @xmath145 as the volume that would be enclosed by the same object if it were pushed out to the flux density limit of the sample , and @xmath146 as the volume enclosed within a redshift of @xmath142 .",
    "if a population of @xmath147 sources is uniformly distributed for redshifts @xmath148 , then @xmath149 would be distributed uniformly between 0 and 1 , with a mean of @xmath150 @xcite .",
    "values of the mean @xmath151 correspond to an increase in comoving density with redshift , while @xmath152 indicates a deficit of high - redshift objects .",
    "note that the values of @xmath153 do not measure the strength of the evolution directly @xcite , and it would be wrong to use this test to compare the relative rates of evolution at high and low redshifts .",
    "in figure  [ vvmax ] we present the results of applying this test to the 2-mjy hercules sample . over all redshifts , we find @xmath154 , differing from the no - evolution line by 3-@xmath18 .",
    "the significance of the result remains at @xmath155-@xmath18 for all redshifts @xmath127 . at the highest redshifts , @xmath106 , the significance is @xmath17-@xmath18 , due to the small number of sources ( 5.4 after weighting ) .",
    "in particular , the highest - redshift source in the sample ( 53w061 at @xmath156 ) is the only object at @xmath157 , and with a weight of 2.35 it has a disproportionate effect on the test .",
    "we illustrate this in figure  [ vvmax ] by removing 53w061 from the sample and repeating the banded @xmath65  test .",
    "the value of @xmath158 then falls to @xmath159 at @xmath106 .",
    "recall that 53w061 has two peaks in its photometric redshift likelihood function and we chose the high - redshift peak on the basis of its identification as a likely quasar on the mayall photographic plates .",
    "however , it is possible that the source is actually at the lower redshift ( @xmath160 ) ; thus excluding it from the @xmath65  test is not unreasonable .",
    "the small values of @xmath161  at all redshifts point to a genuine deficit of high - redshift objects in the sample .",
    "it does nt mean that there is a decline in the comoving density of sources at low redshift , but rather a lack of strong positive evolution at low-@xmath35 in this population is failing to cancel the high - redshift negative evolution .",
    "for example , in the psr survey ( dp90 ) there is enough positive evolution out to @xmath96 to make the initial banded numbers greater than 0.5 , until the negative evolution at high redshift begins to dominate @xmath161 . in the hercules sample",
    ", however , there is little if any positive evolution ( compare figure  [ rlfdata ] ) and so the high-@xmath35 deficit dominates @xmath161  at all redshifts .    could the results of the @xmath65  test be due to something other than a high-@xmath35 decline in the comoving density of sources ? looking at the values of @xmath65  for the individual objects shows that 25% of the sample could have been detected at @xmath162 , but there are in fact no sources at such redshifts . comparing the open and solid points in figure  [ vvmax ] suggests that just a few sources at the highest redshifts may remove the evidence for evolution at @xmath157 . to investigate this we added to the distribution the three unidentified sources , placing them at random redshifts ( @xmath163 )",
    "this did not change the result of the test ; in fact , placing all three sources at @xmath106 actually increased the significance of the negative evolution at the highest redshifts ( recall that the error on @xmath161  goes as @xmath164 ) .",
    "therefore the conclusion that there is a significant decline in the source density can not be falsely attributed to the properties of just a few sources .",
    "another concern is the effect that spectral curvature may have on the results of the @xmath65  test .",
    "in calculating @xmath145 we assumed that the 0.61.4  ghz spectral indices of the sources remain constant at higher frequency , but that need not be the case . if the radio spectrum steepens at higher frequencies then the luminosity of a source will be lower than that calculated from the observed spectral index , and the inferred @xmath145 will also be smaller",
    ". this in turn will give a larger value for @xmath65 .",
    "we thus repeated the test after increasing the spectral index of each source ( @xmath165 , where @xmath10 ) . for reasonable changes in spectral index ,",
    "@xmath166 , the results remain essentially unchanged although the significance drops from 3-@xmath18 to 2-@xmath18 at zero redshift .",
    "the spectral indices must be increased by @xmath167 before the data become consistent with no evolution at @xmath168 , and even then values of @xmath161  @xmath1690.3 are found at higher redshifts .",
    "thus the results are robust against spectral curvature .",
    "spectroscopic observations of sources in the lbds hercules sample have yielded new redshifts for 11 objects , bringing the redshift content of the sample to 65% ( 47 of 72 sources ) .",
    "upper limits to the redshifts of a further 10 sources have been found , based on the absence of a redshifted lyman - limit break in their spectra .    for the remaining one - third of the sample we have estimated their redshifts from their broadband photometry . after testing several estimation methods on our data , we found that the most accurate results were produced by modelling the spectra as the sum of an old ( 14  gyr ) stellar population plus a young ( 0.1  gyr ) stellar population that contributes some fraction ( @xmath170 ) to the 5000-  flux . comparing the photometric with the spectroscopic redshift for those sources with a measured redshift showed that our estimates have an accuracy of @xmath171 and an rms dispersion of @xmath172 , comparable to that of other authors @xcite .",
    "we have used the combined spectroscopic plus photometric redshift distribution of the 2-mjy hercules sample to investigate the evolution of the 1.4  ghz radio luminosity function . the 2-mjy sample , which excludes the nine sources with @xmath173  mjy and weights @xmath174 , has a median redshift of 0.80 , comparable to surveys of lower flux density @xcite .",
    "the fact that the redshift distribution hardly changes over two orders of magnitude in radio flux , implies that the faint radio source population must be evolving fairly strongly  the fainter surveys are not simply detecting the same population at a higher redshift . the low - flux density ( sub - mjy , @xmath175jy )",
    "surveys are dominated by starbursts , whereas the lbds survey is dominated by giant elliptical radio galaxies and quasars , at least at @xmath176  mjy @xcite .",
    "dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ) generated an ensemble of models of the evolving radio luminosity function of agn for a sample of sources with @xmath177  mjy .",
    "the results indicated that the data required a cut - off in the rlf at @xmath11 for both flat- and steep - spectrum sources .",
    "the models also predicted the redshift distribution of sources at a lower flux density limit .",
    "here we have compared the redshift distribution of the lbds hercules sample with these models , and found that two of them ( ff-4 & ff-5 ) are consistent with the new data . in both models , the rlf is forced to decline from @xmath103 to zero at @xmath178 , with the form of the cut - off being sinusoidal in ff-5 and unconstrained ( beyond being smooth and continuous ) in ff-4 .",
    "the other five models of dp90 are inconsistent with the hercules sample , in particular the simple parametric pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) and luminosity / density evolution ( lde ) models predicted that the mjy radio sources would have been at much higher redshifts than the data allow .",
    "the observed rlf was calculated by directly binning the data in redshift and luminosity , for @xmath904 and @xmath17928 .",
    "comparing the observed rlf with the best - fitting models from dp90 , shows that the low - power ( @xmath180  w  hz@xmath1  sr@xmath1 ) rlf appears to evolve more slowly than at higher luminosities . at high redshifts ( @xmath962 )",
    "the observed rlf shows an unambiguous decrease in the comoving density of sources in all luminosity bins , independent of the models .    finally , we investigated the redshift distribution of the 2-mjy hercules sample via the model - independent banded @xmath65  test .",
    "values of @xmath181 at all redshifts indicate a deficit of high - redshift sources in the sample . this result does not change if the three optically - unidentified sources are actually at high-@xmath35 , nor if the effect of spectral curvature is considered .",
    "we conclude that the data from the lbds hercules sample shows clear evidence for a decline , or cut - off , in the rlf at high redshifts .",
    "the low - luminosity population evolves more slowly and may begin to decline at lower redshifts ( @xmath182 ) than the more powerful sources ( @xmath183 ) .",
    "how do we relate this to the physical evolution of the faint radio source population ?",
    "it is known from synchrotron - aging and energy arguments that the lifetime of a radio source is of the order @xmath184@xmath185 years , thus the rlf does not measure the evolution of individual sources over cosmological timescales but only that of the population as a whole . the evolution in comoving density with redshift can be explained as a change in the formation rate of radio sources .",
    "our results then imply that the low - luminosity ( @xmath186  w  hz@xmath1  sr@xmath1 ) radio sources : ( i ) tend to form at a later epoch than the more powerful sources of dp90 ; and ( ii ) continue to form at a fairly constant rate from @xmath182 until the present day .",
    "alternatively , the evolution in the rlf can be explained by changes in the lifetimes of radio sources ",
    "the high-@xmath35 cut - off could be due to the radio sources being active for shorter periods at higher redshifts .",
    "faint radio galaxies in the 6c survey have been shown to have smaller half - light radii than the powerful 3cr radio galaxies at @xmath182 ( roche , eales & rawlings 1998 ) .",
    "we have similarly found that two of the sources in the fainter lbds hercules sample ( 53w069 and 53w091 , both at @xmath187 ) are smaller still , with half - light radii of @xmath188  kpc @xcite . to the extent that the size of an elliptical galaxy is a measure of its mass",
    ", this suggests that lower luminosity radio sources form in galaxies of lower mass .    combining these results with the evolution that we find in the rlf allows us to build a picture of radio source activity , if we assume the evolution is due to number density changes .",
    "the first powerful radio sources form in massive galaxies at @xmath189  gyr ( @xmath190 ) in our assumed cosmology .",
    "the formation epoch of the first low - luminosity radio sources is not constrained by our data , but is presumably no earlier than this ( the first quasars also appear at @xmath189  gyr ) .",
    "the comoving density of massive galaxies that host powerful radio sources increases rapidly , until it peaks at @xmath1913  gyr ( @xmath192 ) then it falls until the present ( @xmath193  gyr ) .",
    "the comoving density of low - mass galaxies hosting low - luminosity radio sources increases until @xmath1945  gyr ( @xmath182 ) , then it appears to remain roughly constant until today . at any given epoch",
    "the steepness of the rlf means there are always more low - luminosity sources than high - luminosity ones .",
    "note that this division into ` high ' and ` low ' luminosity sources is not meant to imply a dual population ",
    "radio sources have a continuous range of luminosities and so the redshift of the turnover in the rlf is presumed to also vary continuously .",
    "this evolution can be understood as follows .",
    "more massive galaxies have more gas available as fuel for the agn .",
    "they also have a deeper potential well , so it is easier for the gas to fall into the centre of the galaxy .",
    "therefore it takes less time for sufficient gas to be accreted to trigger the agn , and more luminous radio sources preferentially form at earlier epochs . with less gas and a shallower potential",
    "well , less - massive galaxies will typically take longer to become active and will have a lower radio luminosity .",
    "this interpretation of the data is not unique , as density evolution is not the only possible explanation of the evolving rlf .",
    "for example , changes in the intergalactic medium with redshift will affect the propagation of the radio jets which could in turn affect their lifetimes . as we noted above",
    ", shorter source lifetimes would reduce the rlf at high-@xmath35 without needing to invoke number density changes .",
    "however , density evolution of the form outlined above will likely be an important , if not dominant , factor governing the observed evolution in the rlf .",
