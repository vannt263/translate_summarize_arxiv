    "cosmological observations provide compelling evidence that about 95% of the content of the universe resides in two unknown forms of energy that we call dark matter and dark energy : the first residing in bound objects as non - luminous matter @xcite , the latter in the form of a zero - point energy that pervades the whole universe @xcite .",
    "the dark matter is thought to be composed of cold neutral weakly interacting massive particles , beyond those existing in the standard model of particle physics , and not yet detected in accelerators or in dedicated direct and indirect searches .",
    "there are many possible candidates for dark matter , the most popular ones being the axions and the weakly interacting massive particles ( wimp ) ( for a review of the particle physics aspects of dark matter see @xcite ) .",
    "their interaction cross section with normal baryonic matter , while extremely small , are expected to be non - zero and we may expect to detect them directly . it has also been suggested that the dark matter in the universe might be composed of superheavy particles , with mass @xmath1 gev @xcite .",
    "but observational results show the dark matter can be composed of superheavy particles only if these interact weakly with normal matter or if their mass is above @xmath2 gev @xcite .",
    "scalar fields or other long range coherent fields coupled to gravity have also intensively been used to model galactic dark matter @xcite .",
    "alternative theoretical models to explain the galactic rotation curves have also been elaborated recently @xcite .    in order to explain",
    "the recent observational data , the @xmath3cdm ( @xmath3 cold dark matter ) model was developed @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3cdm model successfully describes the accelerated expansion of the universe , the observed temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation , the large scale matter distribution , and the main aspects of the formation and the evolution of virialized cosmological objects .    despite these important achievements , at galactic scales @xmath4 kpc",
    ", the @xmath5cdm model meets with severe difficulties in explaining the observed distribution of the invisible matter around the luminous one .",
    "in fact , @xmath6-body simulations , performed in this scenario , predict that bound halos surrounding galaxies must have very characteristic density profiles that feature a well pronounced central cusp , @xmath7 @xcite , where @xmath8 is a scale radius and @xmath9 is a characteristic density . on the observational side ,",
    "high - resolution rotation curves show , instead , that the actual distribution of dark matter is much shallower than the above , and it presents a nearly constant density core : @xmath10 @xcite , where @xmath11 is the core radius and @xmath12 is the central density .    at very low temperatures , all particles in a dilute bose gas condense to the same quantum ground state , forming a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , i.e. , a sharp peak over a broader distribution in both coordinates and momentum space .",
    "a coherent state develops when the particle density is enough high , or the temperature is sufficiently low .",
    "the bose - einstein condensation process was first observed experimentally in 1995 in dilute alkali gases , such as vapors of rubidium and sodium , confined in a magnetic trap , and cooled to very low temperatures .",
    "a sharp peak in the velocity distribution was observed below a critical temperature , indicating that condensation has occurred , with the alkali atoms condensed in the same ground state and showing a narrow peak in the momentum space and in the coordinate space @xcite .",
    "quantum degenerate gases have been created by a combination of laser and evaporative cooling techniques , opening several new lines of research , at the border of atomic , statistical and condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "the possibility that dark matter could be in the form of a bose - einstein condensate was considered in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the condensate was described by the non - relativistic gross - pitaevskii equation , and its solution was obtained numerically .",
    "an alternative approach was developed in @xcite . by introducing the madelung representation of the wave function ,",
    "the dynamics of the system can be formulated in terms of the continuity equation and of the hydrodynamic euler equations .",
    "hence dark matter can be described as a non - relativistic , newtonian bose - einstein gravitational condensate gas , whose density and pressure are related by a barotropic equation of state . in the case of a condensate with quartic non - linearity ,",
    "the equation of state is polytropic with index @xmath0 . to test the validity of the model the newtonian tangential velocity equation of the model",
    "was fitted with a sample of rotation curves of low surface brightness and dwarf galaxies , respectively .",
    "a very good agreement was found between the theoretical rotation curves and the observational data for the low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "therefore dark matter halos can be described as an assembly of light individual bosons that acquire a repulsive interaction by occupying the same ground energy state .",
    "that prevents gravity from forming the central density cusps .",
    "the condensate particle is light enough to naturally form condensates of very small masses that later may coalesce , forming the structures of the universe in a similar way than the hierarchical clustering of the bottom - up cdm picture .",
    "then , at large scales , bec perfectly mimic an ensemble of cold particles , while at small scales quantum mechanics drives the mass distribution .",
    "different properties of the bose - einstein condensate dark matter halos , like the effects of the rotation and of the vortices , as well as the cosmological effects of the condensation were also investigated @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to study the global cosmological dynamics of gravitationally self - bound bose - einstein dark matter condensates , and the evolution of the small cosmological perturbations in the condensate .",
    "the equations of motion of the condensate dark matter are obtained in a post - newtonian approximation by using the conservation of the general relativistic energy - momentum tensor , and considering the small velocity limit .",
    "the cosmological dynamics of the bose - einstein condensate is also studied .",
    "the exact solution of the friedmann equations is obtained , and it is compared with the standard einstein - de sitter cosmological model . in order to study the evolution of the small cosmological perturbations the equation describing the newtonian perturbations with pressure is obtained in a general form , by also taking into account a term which was neglected in the previous studies of this problem @xcite .",
    "the equation of the density contrast for the bose - einstein condensate is investigated by using both analytical and numerical methods .",

    "this is the case for condensates in the dilute limit below two dimensions . but",
    "as space dimensionality decreases , it becomes increasingly harder for the repulsive particles to avoid collisions .",
    "thus the correlations between particle dominate , and the quartic nonlinearity should be replaced by a more general , power - law term @xcite .",
    "hence more general models , with the non - linearity term of the form @xmath68 , where @xmath69 constant and @xmath70 constant , can also be considered . in this case",

    "these fluctuations inflated up to super - horizon scales , producing a near scale - invariant , and near gaussian , set of primordial potential fluctuations . at the end of inflation ,",
    "the universe is reheated , and particles and radiation are produced . in this hot early phase ,",
    "cold thermal relics ( dark matter ) are also formed @xcite .",
    "dark matter particles interact gravitationally , and possibly through the weak interaction . therefore in order to obtain some physically realistic initial conditions for the state of the universe during large scale structure formation , one needs to evolve cosmological perturbations , starting from initial conditions , deep inside the radiation epoch , and far outside the hubble radius .",
    "initial conditions for photons , neutrinos , cold dark matter and baryons have been obtained , in the framework of the standard @xmath3cdm cosmological model , in both the synchronous and newtonian gauges , by @xcite . in the conventional method ,",
    "the power spectrum of the matter fluctuations in the universe is computed by numerically solving the boltzmann equation .",
    "the power spectrum is usually obtained in the linear theory , and then extrapolated to the present epoch . in the standard cosmology , in first - order eulerian perturbation theory , all modes evolve independently , and the power spectrum can be scaled back to the initial epoch via the growth function @xcite .",
    "moreover , the effect of the dark matter pressure is generally ignored in the conventional methods of generating initial conditions . on the other hand , the exact moment in the history of the universe when the bose - einstein condensation occurred",
    "is not known .",
    "that s why obtaining the rigorous and physically well motivated initial conditions for the density contrast @xmath239 and for its derivative for bec dark matter requires the full investigation of the cosmological dynamics from the reheating era , by taking into account the dark matter condensation and pressure effects .",

    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] , for all initial conditions , in the case of the bose - einstein , for a given @xmath126 , the amplitude of the density contrast is higher as compared to the case of the standard dark matter model .",
    "the condensate enters more rapidly in the non - linear phase ( @xmath292 ) than the pressureless dark matter .",
    "thus the presence of the bose - einstein condensate dark matter can significantly accelerate the process of cosmic structure formation .",
    "in the present paper we have considered the global cosmological evolution and the evolution of the small cosmological perturbation in a bose - einstein dark matter condensate .",
    "the basic equation describing the evolution of the small perturbations in the post - newtonian regime was obtained , and its solutions have been studied by using both analytical and numerical methods . the evolution of the density perturbations of the condensate has been compared to the evolution of the small cosmological perturbations in a pressureless fluid evolving in an einstein - de sitter cosmological background . depending on the numerical values of the physical parameters describing the condensate ( the mass of the particle and the scattering length , respectively ) , significant differences could appear in the evolution of the bose - einstein condensate dark matter halos , as compared to the standard pressureless dark matter models .",
    "these differences appear at both the level of the global cosmological evolution , and of the behavior of the small perturbations in the dark matter fluid , and they could have fundamental implications for the formation of the large - scale structure in the universe .",
    "one of the most important problems present day cosmology faces is the problem of the galaxy formation . to explain galaxy formation the evolution of the linear density and temperature perturbations in a universe with dark matter , baryons , and radiation must be computed . for pressureless dark matter the evolution of the perturbations of all cosmic components , from cosmic recombination until the epoch of the first galaxies , was obtained in @xcite .",
    "the evolution of sub - horizon linear perturbations can be described by two coupled , second - order differential equations , with the pressureless dark matter interacting gravitationally with itself , and with the baryons , while the baryons experience both gravity and pressure .",
    "starting from very low values on sub - horizon scales , the baryon density perturbations gradually approach those in the dark matter , and the temperature perturbations approach the value expected for an adiabatic gas .",
    "the presence of the baryons does not modify significantly the evolution of the dark matter perturbations . by including the effect of the bec pressure in the perturbations equations for baryons and dark matter",
    ", a more general ( and realistic ) description of the galaxy formation process can be obtained .",
    "the presence of the bec modifies the dynamical evolution of the baryons , and the growth of linear perturbations , which provide the initial conditions for the formation of galaxies . in the bec condensate model",
    "the dark matter perturbations grow more rapidly than in the standard cosmology , and therefore this could lead to a much faster growth rate of the baryonic perturbations , accelerating the galaxy formation process .",
    "a major recent experimental advance in the study of the bose - einstein condensation processes was the observation of the collapse and subsequent explosion of the condensates @xcite .",
    "a dynamical study of an attractive @xmath293rb bec in an axially symmetric trap was done , where the interatomic interaction was manipulated by changing the external magnetic field , thus exploiting a nearby feshbach resonance . in the vicinity of a feshbach resonance the atomic scattering length a can be varied over a huge range , by adjusting an external magnetic field . consequently , the sign of the scattering length is changed , thus transforming a repulsive condensate of @xmath293rb atoms into an attractive one , which naturally evolves into a collapsing and exploding condensate . from a simple physical point of view",
    "the collapse of the bose - einstein condensates can be described as follows . when the number of particles becomes sufficiently large , so that @xmath294 , where @xmath295 is a critical number , the attractive inter - particle energy overcomes the quantum pressure , and the condensate implodes .",
    "in the course of the implosion stage , the density of particles increases in the small vicinity of the trap center .",
    "when it approaches a certain critical value , a fraction of the particles gets expelled . in a time period of an order of few milliseconds ,",
    "the condensate again stabilizes .",
    "there are two observable components at the final stage of the collapse : remnant and burst particles .",
    "the remnant particles are those which remain in the condensate .",
    "the burst particles have an energy much larger than that of the condensed particles .",
    "there is also a fraction of particles , which is not observable .",
    "this fraction is usually referred to as the missing particles .",
    "the scattering length @xmath34 is defined as the zero - energy limit of the scattering amplitude @xmath296  @xcite .",
    "depending on the spin dependence of the underlying particle interaction , the scattering length may in general be also spin dependent .",
    "the spin independent part of the quantity is referred to as the coherent scattering length @xmath34 .",
    "the scattering lengths can be obtained for some systems in the laboratory , but for dark matter it is unknown .",
    "another essential parameter is the mass @xmath39 of the condensate particle , which , due to the lack of information about the physical nature of the dark matter , is a free parameter , which must be constrained by observations . due to the lack of any physical information about the numerical values of these two fundamental parameters , in the numerical estimations performed in the present paper we have given different numerical values to a combination of these two basic quantities .",
    "since bose - einstein condensates are less stable with respect to perturbations than usual non - condensate matter , we expect that in such a condensate evolution of the perturbations and the subsequent collapse could take place much faster than in the usual non - condensed matter .",
    "this would strongly affect the formation of the large scale structure in the early universe .",
    "in this paper we have provided some basic theoretical tools necessary for the in depth comparison of the predictions of the condensate model and of the observational results .",
