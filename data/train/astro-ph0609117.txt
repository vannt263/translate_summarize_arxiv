    "the longest - running radial - velocity surveys are now approaching time baselines of 16 - 18 years @xcite .",
    "these surveys now achieve internal measurement precisions such that the signals from long - period giant planets ( @xmath1yr ) are now entering the realm of detectability @xcite . for example",
    ", the high resolution spectrograph ( hrs ) on the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) now has a velocity precision of 3 - 4 @xcite , the keck hires is achieving 1 - 2  since its 2004 ccd upgrade @xcite , and the harps instrument has demonstrated precision better than 1 @xcite . of particular interest are putative multi - planet systems , wherein the residuals of a known - planet s orbit show keplerian periodicity indicative of a distant giant planet companion in the system .",
    "finding systems which contain long - period giant planets as well as planets in closer orbits will address important questions about the uniqueness of our own solar system s architecture .",

    "2006 ) . of particular interest",
    "are systems which contain both short - period and long - period jovian planets .",
    "such systems could provide clues to address the question of how the processes of planet formation and migration can result in both `` hot '' and `` cold '' jupiters in the same planetary system .    in this paper , we present improved fits to the known planets in nine systems using all available data , and",
    "we investigate the possibility of additional long - period objects . in  2 , we briefly describe the data acquisition and fitting procedure .",
    "the results are given in  3 , including our solutions for seven additional planetary systems in the mcdonald observatory planet search program .",
    "all of our radial - velocity measurements for these objects are presented in tables 5 - 14 . in this paper",
    ", we use the terms `` mcdonald '' to refer to data taken with the mcdonald observatory 2.7  m harlan j.  smith ( hjs ) telescope , and `` het '' to refer to data taken with the 9.2  m hobby - eberly telescope .",
    "data obtained from the mcdonald observatory planet search program @xcite are discussed fully in @xcite .",
    "available published data were combined with the mcdonald data to fit keplerian orbits using gaussfit @xcite .",
    "gaussfit has the ability to allow the offsets between data sets to be a free parameter .",
    "parameters of the primary stars considered are given in table 1 ; masses , [ fe / h ] , and @xmath6 are from @xcite , and the chromospheric activity index log @xmath7 is derived from ca  ii measurements from the mcdonald observatory spectra . for each object , we searched for periodic signals in the residuals to the known planet s orbit using the periodogram method @xcite . to assess the statistical significance of those periods , the false alarm probabilities ( fap ) were calculated using the bootstrap randomization method detailed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the keplerian orbital fits are shown in figures  1 - 4 , and the orbital parameters implied by those fits are given in table 2 . in computing the planetary minimum mass m  sin @xmath8 and semimajor axis @xmath9 , the stellar masses derived by @xcite listed in table 1 were used , with adopted uncertainties of 0.05 .",
    "@xcite first reported the 1090-day companion to 47  uma using data from lick observatory . with additional velocity measurements over 13 years , @xcite announced a long - period second planet , 47  uma  c , with a period of 2594@xmath090 days and a mass of 0.76 .",
    "@xcite presented elodie observations of 47  uma , and noted that the second planet was not evident in their data , which were fit well with a single keplerian model .",
    "we now fit four data sets for 47  uma : lick ( fischer et al  2002 , n=91 ) , elodie ( naef et al .  2004 , n=44 ) , 2.7 m hjs telescope ( n=35 ) , and the hobby - eberly telescope ( het , n=201 ) . the het data , which consist of multiple exposures per visit ,",
    "were binned using the weighted mean value of the velocities in each visit .",
    "the quadrature sum of the rms about the mean and the mean internal error bar was adopted as the error bar of each binned point ( n=63 ) .",
    "the offset between the overlapping hjs and het datasets was used to merge them into one , which was used in all fits .",
    "the one - planet fit ( model  1 ) and the residuals to that fit are shown in figure  1 .",
    "we emphasize that this fit includes all available published data , over a time span of more than 18 years , and includes 195 high - precision measurements obtained with the het high - resolution spectrograph at 61 independent epochs , which are given in table 6 .",
    "the total rms about the combined one - planet fit is 10.4 .",
    "the rms scatter about the one - planet fit for each of the four datasets is : lick10.7 , elodie13.0 , hjs13.5 , het4.9 .",
    "a periodogram of the residuals of all of the data to the 1-planet fit is shown in figure 2 .",
    "no clear peak rises above the noise level at any period between 2 and 10000 days ; the total duration of the available data is now about 6900 days ( 18.3 years ) . while a peak is present at about 2212 days , close to the period reported for 47  uma  c by @xcite , its false - alarm probability ( fap ) is 27.2% .    to further explore the possible presence of 47  uma  c",
    ", we fit all of the datasets with a two - planet model fixed at the parameters of @xcite ( model  2 ) , and then repeated the fit allowing all parameters to be free except for @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the second planet ( model 3 ) , which were fixed at 0.005 and 127@xmath12 , respectively , after @xcite .",
    "no models achieved convergence with those two parameters free .",
    "the fit obtained by model 3 is shown in the right panel of figure  2 .",
    "model 2 had a reduced chi - square ( @xmath13 ) of 5.81 and an rms of 12.7  about the fit , whereas model 3 had a @xmath13 of 2.11 and an rms of 8.4 . for comparison ,",
    "the one - planet fit ( model 1 ) had a @xmath13 of 3.23 and an rms of 10.4 . noting that the poor fit of model 2 was largely due to errors in the period of the inner planet ,",
    "we re - did the fits allowing the parameters for the inner planet to be free while fixing those of the outer planet at the values reported by @xcite ( model 4 ) .",
    "the @xmath13 of this fit was 2.68 , with an rms of 10.2 .",
    "these tests are summarized in table 3 .",
    "the free two - planet ( model 3 ) fit was the best of the four , in terms of both the goodness - of - fit criterion ( @xmath13 ) and the total rms scatter about the fits .",
    "the rms about the individual datasets for this fit is the following : lick8.0 , elodie11.1 , hjs10.1 , het5.3 .",
    "the parameters for the 47  uma planetary system given in table  2 are those obtained by model  3 .",
    "although the best - fit set of parameters obtained a period of 7586 days for the outer planet , there is no corresponding peak on the periodogram shown in figure  2 .",
    "however , the periodogram method is not as reliable when the periodic signal approaches or exceeds the total duration of observations , as is the case here , where the total time baseline is 6942 days .",
    "we note that we have been able to reproduce the result of @xcite by this method ; i.e.  a periodogram analysis of the lick data alone after removing 47  uma  b revealed a strong peak at 2083 days , but still with a fap of 0.15% .",
    "we are also able to recover the @xcite parameters of 47  uma  c from the lick data alone .",
    "since the total time coverage of the lick data presented in @xcite is 5114 days ( 14  yr ) , an analysis of those data alone is not adequate to fully constrain the 7586-day period obtained by our best - fit model which adds four years to the total duration of observations .",
    "it is possible that the shorter period for 47  uma  c reported by @xcite is an alias of the true period ; at present , our fits indicate that period to be about three times longer , but with substantial uncertainty .    to further test the methods by which we conclude that the parameters of 47  uma  c reported by @xcite are dubious",
    ", we performed some monte carlo simulations . from each of the three data sets considered in the fits described above",
    ", we generated 1000 simulated sets of velocities consisting of a keplerian signal plus 7  of gaussian noise for each of the two planets .",
    "the parameters for the inner planet were those listed in table 2 , and those of the outer planet were those of @xcite .",
    "these simulated datasets retained the times of observation and the error bars of the originals .",
    "the simulated data were then fit with a one - planet model exactly as described above , then the residuals of the one - planet fit were examined by the periodogram method , to determine whether the signal of the second planet was recovered .",
    "the criteria for recovery were that the period of the second planet had to be detected correctly and with a fap of less than 0.1% .",
    "this fap was computed using the analytic fap formula of @xcite .",
    "of the 1000 trials , only 6 did not result in a successful recovery of the signal of the second planet .",
    "the correct period was recovered 999 times , and the fap exceeded 0.1% only 5 times ; the worst fap was 0.24% . for comparison ,",
    "the analytic fap of the 2212-day peak in the residuals of the 1-planet fit is 1.7% , a factor of 7 higher .",
    "these results indicate that our method should have been able to detect the signal of 47  uma  c , had it been present with the parameters given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we conclude that while an additional long - period object may be present , the data currently available do not provide sufficient evidence for an orbital solution .",
    "thirty - five radial - velocity measurements of 14  her ( = hd  145675 ) obtained at mcdonald observatory were combined with published data from keck hires @xcite and elodie @xcite .",
    "the fit to the combination of these three data sets is shown in figure  3 , and the system parameters implied by that fit are given in table 2 .",
    "it is evident from figure  3 that the single keplerian fit is inadequate ( rms=13.0 ) ; indeed , the residuals to the fit show a clear curvature .",
    "@xcite noted an upward linear velocity trend of 3.6@xmath00.3 m s@xmath14 yr@xmath14 in their observations which covered the time interval 1994 to 2003 , but the keck data of @xcite indicated no such trend . when the complete 12  yr duration of observations is examined , we see that those keck data were serendipitously obtained during a period of relatively constant residual velocity , and the more recent mcdonald data are now indicating a downward trend . fitting a double - keplerian model ( figure  4 ) with @xmath15 for the outer body fixed at 2449100.0 yields an eccentricity consistent with zero : @xmath16 . fixing the eccentricity of 14  her  c at 0.0 gives a minimal orbit solution with period @xmath17 days , and a velocity semi - amplitude @xmath18 .",
    "these orbital elements imply a minimum mass m  sin  @xmath8=2.1  at a semimajor axis of 6.9  au .",
    "this represents the lowest possible mass and the shortest period for the outer companion .",
    "the rms scatter about the three data sets is as follows : elodie  10.4 , keck  2.9 , mcdonald  5.8 .",
    "the total rms about this two - planet fit is 8.4 , with a @xmath19 of 1.67 .",
    "the minimal orbit proposed above for 14  her  c has a periastron distance of 6.2  au , and 14  her  b has an apastron distance of 3.76  au .",
    "the orbit of 14  her  c , at a large semimajor axis with a small eccentricity , is similar to that of hd  72659b @xcite and hd  50499b @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that such fits are preliminary , and are only given in order to place a lower limit on the period and mass of this object .",
    "@xcite performed dynamical simulations of the 14  her system , and proposed the existence of 14  her  c based on fits to data from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the two most - favored models had 14  her  c near the 3:1 or 6:1 mean - motion resonance ( mmr ) , which coincided with highly stable orbital configurations as determined by their dynamical simulations .",
    "the preliminary fit obtained in this work suggests a 4:1 resonance for 14  her  c. we attempted to fit a double - keplerian model with 14  her  c fixed at the 3:1 mmr parameters indicated in @xcite , but obtained a substantially worse fit ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "an upper limit on the mass of 14  her  c can be estimated from the results of adaptive - optics ( ao ) imaging by @xcite , who used the keck  ii ao system to search for companions to 25 extrasolar planet - host stars .",
    "no candidate companions were found around 14  her , and the detection limits derived from their study exclude stellar - mass objects objects at orbital separations @xmath21 9  au ( see luhman & jayawardhana 2002 , their fig .",
    "a similar study by @xcite using the lick ao system also excluded stellar - mass objects beyond about 12.7  au .",
    "we can therefore use the upper limit provided by @xcite and our lower bound to constrain the mass of the outer companion between about 2.1 and 80 . a more definitive statement on its nature , of course ,",
    "requires many more years of observations , until a second velocity turnaround is confirmed .",
    "the large separation implied by these data make 14  her an attractive target for future direct imaging attempts and for astrometric follow - up .",
    "the astrometric perturbation due to 14  her  c would be @xmath220.9  mas , using the minimal orbit solution given above . for sin  @xmath8=0.5 , this signal would be @xmath231.8  mas , equivalent to that of @xmath24  eri  b @xcite . since the astrometric perturbation increases with semimajor axis and planet mass , the signal could be much larger @xcite .      the addition of new data from the hjs telescope presented in this paper , and the use of multiple independent data sets in fitting keplerian orbits , have generally improved the precision of the derived planetary parameters by 25 - 50% . in particular ,",
    "the precision of the orbital periods have been improved by the addition of new data , due to the increased number of orbits now observed . in this section ,",
    "we briefly describe the results of our combined fits for seven additional systems for which the revised orbital solutions are in agreement with previously published results .",
    "our parameters are within 2@xmath25 of previous values except for @xmath15 and @xmath11 of @xmath26  and  c , and @xmath27 and @xmath11 of @xmath26  and  d , which differ from @xcite by between 2.7 and 3.8 sigma .",
    "the inner planet of hd  217107 , with a period of 7.1 days , was first reported in @xcite , and additional coralie data supporting this discovery were published by @xcite . a shallow parabolic trend in the residuals",
    "was noted by @xcite .",
    "@xcite used more recent keck data to postulate an outer companion with @xmath4 years . however , this object has not completed a full orbit , and hence there is a wide range of possible solutions . @xcite",
    "revised the period of hd  217107c to 20,140 days ( 55 years ) , and @xcite give a period of 3150 days ; our fits with the short period improved @xmath19 by only 0.07 over the long period .",
    "we fit four datasets for hd  217107 : lick @xcite , coralie @xcite , keck @xcite , and 20 observations from mcdonald .",
    "we fit a double - keplerian model using the parameters for planet  c from @xcite as a starting point for the least - squares fitting procedure .",
    "the rms of this double - keplerian fit is 9.0 , and the results are given in table 2 .",
    "the resulting parameters are in agreement with @xcite to within 2@xmath25 .",
    "@xcite performed separate fits to the lick and keck data and commented on the high degree of uncertainty in the parameters of hd  217107c .",
    "the combined fits given in this work support the @xmath283150-day period reported by @xcite , but the uncertainties remain large . at present , no definitive statements can be made until this object completes a significant fraction of an orbit , or until such time as it can be detected via direct imaging or astrometry , techniques which are well - suited to very long - period objects .",
    "the three planets around @xmath26 and ( = hd  9826 ) were fit with a triple - keplerian model , combining the lick data of @xcite and the advanced fiber optic echelle ( afoe ) data of @xcite with 41 observations from mcdonald .",
    "lick data preceding the hamilton spectrometer upgrade ( 1995 february ) were excluded following @xcite .",
    "the total rms about the fit is 14.6 . as shown in table 4 , analysis of the residuals to a triple - keplerian fit resulted in only a marginally significant periodicity at 2000 days ( fap=0.4% ) .",
    "@xcite first detected the inner companion to hd  168443 using the hires spectrograph on keck  i. the outer 4.8-yr planet was then reported in @xcite and confirmed by @xcite . a two - planet fit to the mcdonald data combined with that of @xcite and @xcite",
    "yields an rms of 9.5 .",
    "the parameters given in table  2 are in agreement with those of @xcite within 2@xmath25 .",
    "periodogram analysis of the residuals to the double - keplerian fit revealed a 63-day periodicity with a fap of 0.12% ( table 4 ) . performing the same analysis on the three datasets separately , however , showed no enhanced power at that period . additionally , the period of the inner planet is 58 days , preventing any object in a 63-day orbit .",
    "the following five planets showed no residual periodicities of interest .",
    "the hot jupiter orbiting hd  179949 was found by the anglo - australian planet search program using the 3.9 m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) @xcite .",

    "we have combined new radial - velocity observations from mcdonald observatory with previously published data to improve the precision of the orbital parameters for 9 planetary systems .",
    "the largest data set yet assembled on 47  uma indicates no statistically significant signal attributable to a second planet in the system .",
    "we have examined the residuals to our keplerian fits , and for the case of 14  her , we find clear evidence for a distant outer companion , which appears to be in a 4:1 resonance with the inner planet .    this research was supported by nasa grants nng04g141 g and nng05g107 g . r.w .",
