    "astrophysical collapse processes are one of the main sources of gravitational radiation",
    ". however , the complexity of the einstein equations makes it very difficult to model such processes mathematically .",
    "this is why we turn here to a dust model .",
    "dust is the simplest material for astrophysical and cosmological studies and may be interpreted as a many - particle system with only gravitational interaction between its particles .",
    "unfortunately , one can not study gravitational radiation in spherically symmetric spacetimes ( e.g. the oppenheimer - snyder collapse @xcite ) since the birkhoff theorem shows radiation to be absent .",
    "for this reason , much work has been devoted to studying cylindrical symmetry , e.g. @xcite .",
    "there is an interesting suggestion for the description of cylindrically symmetric dust models by singh and vaz . in @xcite",
    "they examine the collapse of an infinite cylinder of dust making the assumption that the axial and azimuthal metric functions are connected by a simple relation .",
    "the authors discuss the resulting field equations qualitatively and note a striking analog to the friedman equations that describe the interior of the oppenheimer - snyder collapse .",
    "this paper is meant to show that this statement is not accidental . by _ solving _ the differential equations we obtain a geometry that is a piece of the friedman universe ( with a 3-space of constant curvature ) .",
    "nevertheless , by introducing double polar coordinates the geometry takes the form of a cylindrically symmetric space - time as well .",
    "we want to find solutions of the einstein equations which describe an infinite cylinder of dust ( no pressure : @xmath0 ) . in this case",
    ", the stress - energy tensor of an ideal fluid simplifies to @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the radial and the time component of the co - moving coordinates @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the four - velocity with the special structure @xmath6 ( we choose units in which @xmath7 ) .",
    "we discuss the general cylindrically symmetric line element @xmath8 but with the additional assumption that for the functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 of the line element the condition @xmath11 holds .",
    "this assumption generalizes a property of the surface geometry of cylinders in flat 3-spaces : surfaces @xmath12 , @xmath13 have the line element @xmath14 which differs only by a conformal factor ( a constant for every slice ) from the usual expression @xmath15 .",
    "from @xmath16 and by using eq .",
    "one finds @xmath17 with the solution @xmath18 where @xmath19 is einstein s gravitational constant , @xmath20 . using this result , the einstein equations are ( see @xcite ) @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 where a dot and prime denote derivatives with respect to @xmath3 and @xmath2 respectively .",
    "eq . has the solution @xmath25 and eq .",
    "has the first integral @xmath26 the combination of these two relations gives @xmath27 this equation can be integrated .",
    "one obtains @xmath28\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath29 using these results , the metrical coefficients take the form @xmath30},\\ b=\\frac{\\sqrt{\\rho}}{h(t)[g(\\rho)+d(t)]},\\ l=\\frac{1}{h(t)\\rho[g(\\rho)+d(t)]^2}\\ .\\ ] ]    we have not yet ensured that equations and are fulfilled .",
    "if one substitutes @xmath9 and @xmath31 from into eq . then one finds @xmath32{\\mathrm{e}}^{-3h}\\ ] ] with the definition @xmath33 .",
    "the derivative with respect to time @xmath3 of this equation leads to @xmath34 .",
    "hence one can set , without loss of generality , @xmath35 because @xmath36 only appears in the form @xmath37 and would thus merely lead to a redefinition of the metric function @xmath38 . then simplifies to @xmath39 that this expression is constant , follows from the fact that the left - most expression is a function of @xmath2 alone , whereas the expression to its right is a function @xmath3 alone .",
    "the mass density then is given by @xmath40 thus @xmath41 is a spatial constant for every time @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath42 has to satisfy the equation @xmath43 we have yet to satisfy eq . .",
    "by using with @xmath44 one finds @xmath45 again the left hand side is a function of another variable than the right hand side and so both sides have to be constant .",
    "this leads to another differential equation for @xmath42 , @xmath46 instead of the system of equations , one could use the two combinations @xmath47 the first equation in follows from the second one by differentiating with respect to time @xmath3 ( for the case @xmath48 , but the case @xmath49 is not possible , because then one would find @xmath50 from and from this @xmath51 from  i.e. a vacuum ) .    due to the freedom of",
    "coordinate transformations , we need only study the cases @xmath52 with @xmath53 . with the definitions @xmath54 and @xmath55 , the second equation in takes the form @xmath56 surprisingly , the scale factor @xmath57 satisfies the dynamical equation of the friedman cosmology .",
    "hence , its solutions are @xmath58    solving eq .",
    "one obtains @xmath59 with an integration constant @xmath60 . finally , with the substitution @xmath61 ( in the case @xmath62 ) or @xmath63 ( in the case @xmath64 ) one arrives ( after stretching the coordinates to eliminate the constant @xmath65 ) at the line elements @xmath66 & \\varepsilon=0 : & { \\mathrm{d}}s^2 & = a^2(t)\\left({\\mathrm{d}}\\rho^2+\\rho^2{\\mathrm{d}}\\varphi^2+{\\mathrm{d}}z^2\\right)-{\\mathrm{d}}t^2\\label{2.27}\\\\[1.5ex ] & \\varepsilon=-1 : & { \\mathrm{d}}s^2&=a^2(t)\\left({\\mathrm{d}}\\chi^2+\\sinh^2\\!\\chi\\,{\\mathrm{d}}\\varphi^2+\\cosh^2\\!\\chi\\,{\\mathrm{d}}z^2\\right)-{\\mathrm{d}}t^2\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the mass density is ( see ) @xmath67",
    "with the line elements and the dynamical equation we finally arrived at the geometry of the friedman models , here described in double polar coordinates @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , cf .",
    "this is quite amazing since we started with cylindrical symmetry and tried to obtain collapse models different from the spherically symmetric oppenheimer - snyder model .    in double polar coordinates the @xmath70-coordinate is limited by @xmath71 $ ] .",
    "however , for a cylinder , @xmath70 should take on all real values . here , we provide a suitable topological interpretation to circumvent this contradiction : for @xmath72,the first line element in , for example , reduces to @xmath73 of course , this is the line element for a sphere of radius @xmath57 with the angular variables @xmath68 and @xmath70 .",
    "now , instead of only one sphere , we consider an infinite number of connected shells ( as sketched in fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath70 increases by @xmath74 one moves from one skin onto another .",
    "this topology leads to a cylindrical interpretation of the solution .",
    "the intention of this paper was to find a cylindrically symmetric solution for collapsing dust .",
    "it turned out that the assumption that the axial and azimuthal metric functions fulfill eq .",
    "leads to only one class of solutions : collapsing friedman universes .",
    "the apparent contradiction between the spherical symmetry of the friedman models and the required cylindrical symmetry was eliminated using a new topological interpretation .",
    "thus we have found an analytic solution describing a collapsing infinite cylinder of dust . to have a complete solution of the einstein equations",
    ", one has to compute the exterior vacuum space - time that matches to the given interior solution ( if such a solution exists , which is not clear a priori ) . for the vacuum region one should use the line element @xmath75+{\\mathrm{e}}^{2u}{\\mathrm{d}}z^2\\ .\\ ] ] then one has to solve the field equations @xmath76    for matching a vacuum region the picture in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] changes : only in the interior region , @xmath77 , is the metric the friedman solution in double polar coordinates .",
    "so one has to cut off a segment around the south pole of the hemisphere of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and connect the inner solution from there to the vacuum region ."
