    "the reliable calculation of physical properties of interacting quantum mechanical systems presents a formidable task . typically , one has to cope with the interplay of different energy - scales possibly covering several orders of magnitude even for simple situations .",
    "approximate tools like perturbation theory , but even numerically exact techniques can usually handle only a restricted window of energy scales and are furthermore limited in their applicability by the approximations involved or the computational resources available .",
    "in addition due to the divergence of certain classes of feynman diagrams some of the interesting many - particle problems can not be tackled by straightforward perturbation theory .",
    "a general scheme that is designed to handle such multitude of energy scales and competition of divergences is the renormalization group @xcite .",
    "the idea of this approach is to start from high energy scales , leaving out possible infrared divergences and work one s way down to the desired low - energy region in a systematic way .",
    "the precise definition of `` systematic way '' does in general depend on the problem studied .",
    "in particular for interacting quantum mechanical many - particle systems , two different schemes attempting a unique , problem independent prescription have emerged during the past decade .",
    "one is wegner s flow equation technique @xcite , where a given hamiltonian is diagonalized by continuous unitary transformation . from the final result",
    "one can extract detailed information about the structure of the ground state and low - lying excitations .",
    "this technique has been applied successfully to both fermionic and bosonic problems @xcite . however ,",
    "in general it becomes a rather cumbersome task to really calculate physical quantities , especially dynamics from correlation functions . here",
    ", one typically has to introduce further approximations @xcite , again tightly tailored for the problem under investigation .",
    "the second field theoretical approach , which we want to focus on in the following , is based on a functional representation of the partition function of the system under consideration .",
    "it has become known as functional renormalization group ( frg ) @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the frg will be given in the next section ; here we make some principle remarks and discuss previous applications .",
    "different versions of the frg have been developed over the last few years .",
    "one either generates an exact infinite hierarchy of coupled differential equations for the amputated connected @xmath0-particle green functions of the many - body system @xcite , or the one - particle irreducible @xmath0-particle vertex functions @xcite respectively . for explicit calculations one has to truncate the set of equations which is the major approximation involved . at what level this truncation",
    "is performed to obtain a tractable set of equations depends on the complexity of the problem .",
    "we here exclusively study the one - particle irreducible version of the frg .",
    "it has the advantage of including self - energy corrections already in low truncation orders and being formally easily extendable to higher orders @xcite .    up to now",
    ", most applications of the frg in many - body physics concentrate on low - dimensional , interacting fermion systems where it provides a possibility to sum diverging classes of diagrams . the homogeneous two - dimensional hubbard model @xcite , the homogeneous one - dimensional tomonaga - luttinger model @xcite , and the one - dimensional lattice model of spinless fermions with nearest neighbor interaction and local impurities @xcite were investigated .",
    "the focus was put on properties of the system close to the fermi surface , for example on the hierarchy of interactions to identify possible instabilities @xcite or on tomonaga - luttinger liquid exponents @xcite .",
    "the frequency dependence of the vertex functions was mostly neglected @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the frequency dependence of the self - energy and the effective interaction . for this purpose , we study two different zero - dimensional ( local ) models : the quantum anharmonic oscillator and a well - known problem of solid state physics , the single impurity anderson model ( siam ) .",
    "the former has quite often been used as a `` toy model '' to investigate the performance of different approximation schemes of many - particle physics @xcite . for this problem conventional perturbation theory",
    "is regular  although it generates a generic example of an asymptotic series @xcite  and one expects that compared to perturbation theory the frg leads to a better agreement with the exact solution at larger coupling constants ( `` renormalization group enhanced perturbation theory '' ) .",
    "we calculate the ground state energy and the energy of the first excited state as well as the spectral function of the propagator .",
    "exact results for these observables can numerically be obtained quite easily .",
    "the siam has a known hierarchy of energy scales , and presents a true challenge to any many - body tool due to the generation of an exponentially small energy scale , the kondo scale , leading for example to a sharp resonance in the single - particle spectrum .",
    "no exact solutions for dynamical quantities of the model are known .",
    "we present frg results for the one - particle spectral function of the impurity site and compare them to conventional second order perturbation theory ( in the interaction @xmath1 of the impurity site ) and wilson s numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) . in both models",
    "the truncated frg scheme , which is correct at least to second order perturbation theory in the interaction , leads to a considerable improvement compared to plain second order perturbation theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present a detailed discussion of the frg .",
    "the third part contains the application to the quantum anharmonic oscillator , while in the forth section we discuss the frg for the single impurity anderson model .",
