    "advances in millimeter receiver technology and observing techniques , as well as the availability of moderate - size millimeter telescopes and arrays , have made recent co observations of distant extragalactic sources possible . during the mid-1980s , co surveys of galaxies selected by their _ iras _ fluxes and colors resulted in co detections of a host of @xmath9 seyfert , hii region - like , and liner galaxies , as well as several qsos and radio galaxies ( e.g. , sanders , scoville , & soifer 1991 ) .",
    "their inferred h@xmath5 masses are @xmath10 m@xmath11 . for galaxies believed to have agns , h@xmath5 provides a possible source of fuel for nuclear activity , as well as for vigorous , circumnuclear star formation .",
    "the detection of co emission in the @xmath12 _ iras _ galaxy fsc 10214 + 4724 ( brown & vanden bout 1991 , 1992 ) revolutionized the field , both because of its cosmological implications and because it proved that it was possible , with modern technology , to detect star - forming gas out to redshifts of a few .",
    "since then , much effort has gone into searching for co in a wide variety of high - redshift objects .    at the time fsc 10214 + 4724 was detected in co , the only sample of galaxies known at comparable redshifts were radio galaxies .",
    "hzprgs were well suited as initial targets for co surveys , primarily because _ ( i ) _ several lzprgs had been detected in co ( phillips et al .",
    "1987 ; mirabel , sanders , & kazs 1989 ; mazzarella et al .",
    "1993 ) , _ ( ii ) _ radio galaxies are observed to span a wide redshift range ( @xmath13 ) and _ ( iii ) _ their redshifts are known to the accuracy required by the 512 mhz bandwidths of millimeter detectors .",
    "although the number of lzprgs observed in co at that time was small , further evidence that radio galaxies as a class may be rich in h@xmath5 came from the observations that a significant fraction ( 2030% ) of lzprgs were known to be infrared luminous ( golombek , miley , & neugebauer 1988 ) .",
    "some have infrared excesses consistent with thermal emission from dust , and many lzprgs possess morphological peculiarities commonly associated with collisions / mergers of galaxy pairs ( heckman et al .",
    "multi - component structures and/or nearby companions are also observed in @xmath14 hzprgs ( spinrad & djorgovski 1984 ; lilly & longair 1984 ; djorgovski et al .",
    "1987 ) , but the _ iras _ flux upper limits yield very little information on the shape and luminosity of the far - infrared emission in these galaxies ( evans et al .",
    "the blue colors of many hzprgs are often cited as additional , though less compelling , evidence that they may be h@xmath5 rich ; the colors may also be due to scattered agn light .    in this article , the results of the co observations of hzprgs ( e.g. , evans et al .",
    "1996 ; downes et al . 1996 ) will first be summarized , followed by a discussion of a complete 60 and 100 @xmath15 flux - limited sample of lzprgs ( e.g. evans et al .",
    "the latter discussion will aim at clarifying the results obtained from the high - redshift observations . with the exception of figure 1",
    ", @xmath16 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 = 4 m@xmath11 ( k km s@xmath4 pc@xmath19 are assumed throughout .",
    "the primary goals of any co survey of high - redshift galaxies are to estimate the h@xmath5 masses and to determine if the h@xmath5 content evolves as a function of redshift .",
    "if the radio power of radio galaxies is correlated with the amount of h@xmath5 , then hzprgs , which are preselected by their high radio luminosity , may have rich circumnuclear isms that serve as fuel for the agn .",
    "thus , a sample of 15 hzprgs spanning the redshift range @xmath20 were selected . for each galaxy ,",
    "observations were done by tuning to @xmath21 rotational co transitions redshifted to frequencies accessible by the 3 mm receivers on the nrao 12 m and iram 30 m telescopes .",
    "eleven hzprgs were eventually observed at one or both telescopes , with integration times of up to 10 hours at the 30 m telescope , and up to 50 hours at the 12 m telescope .",
    "none of the eleven galaxies observed were detected ( figure 1 ) . however , assuming a line width of @xmath22 250 km s@xmath4 ( the average @xmath23 observed for a complete sample of ultraluminous infrared galaxies , uligs : sanders , scoville , & soifer 1991 ) , the 3@xmath24 upper limits for h@xmath5 mass are in the range 3.520@xmath25 m@xmath26 ( @xmath27 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 ) .",
    "further , the four hzprgs with the most sensitive co upper limits would appear to have less h@xmath5 than the most h@xmath5-rich galaxies in the local universe .",
    "this would seem to imply that the h@xmath5 content of radio galaxies does not evolve as a function of redshift or radio power .",
    "is it the case that , while radio - weak uligs show evidence of evolution of h@xmath5 mass with redshift , radio - loud infrared galaxies , such as radio galaxies , do not ? indeed , the recent tentative detection of co in 53w002 ( @xmath28 m@xmath11 of h@xmath5 : scoville et al .",
    "1997 ) , a relatively radio - faint hzprg in comparison with the 11 hzprgs discussed above , may be evidence of an anticorrelation between h@xmath5 mass and radio power .",
    "in actuality , there is very little evidence for evolution of h@xmath5 mass in any class of galaxies as a function of redshift .",
    "iras 10214 + 4724 is now known to be gravitationally lensed ( e.g. eisenhardt et al . 1996 ) ; its inferred intrinsic h@xmath5 mass is @xmath29 m@xmath26 , a fairly average value for an ulig . in 1994 ,",
    "a @xmath30 gravitationally - lensed qso ( h1413 + 117 ) was detected ( barvainis et al . 1994 ) , with an intrinsic luminosity also believed to be average for uligs at low redshift .",
    "two other uligs ( ir 09104 + 4109 at @xmath31 and ir 15307 + 3252 at @xmath32 ) and one high - redshift _ iras_-luminous qso ( pg 1634 + 706 at @xmath33 ) have been searched for co , but the 3@xmath24 upper limits of @xmath34 are less than that of the most gas - rich galaxies observed locally ( evans et al .",
    "finally , the @xmath35 qso br 1202 - 07 has recently been detected and confirmed , and its inferred h@xmath5 mass is @xmath36 m@xmath11 ( omont et al .",
    "1996 ; ohta et al .",
    "this may be the first indication of evolution in h@xmath5 mass with redshift , however , the h@xmath5 mass of br 1202 - 07 is only twice that observed in the most h@xmath5-rich , local galaxies .",
    "there is also evidence for shear due to gravitatiional lensing in the vicinity of the qso , which may indicate that its intrinsic @xmath34 is much lower than observed ( omont et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "if , as is commonly believed , radio galaxies are the progenitors of some giant elliptical galaxies , there are four possible reasons why co emission has not been unambiguously detected in any hzprgs , and why evolution of h@xmath5 mass with redshift is not seen in other classes of galaxies : first , the redshift at which the bulk of stars in present day galaxies formed may be greater than four .",
    "thus , most of the h@xmath5 may have been consumed by starbursts and the agn by the redshift most of these galaxies are located .",
    "second , because merger events must have been more common in the past , most of the h@xmath5 that eventually formed the bulk of the stars in giant elliptical galaxies may be in many smaller , star - forming galaxies .",
    "these individual galaxies may consume most of their h@xmath5 before merging .",
    "third , the duration that galaxies can contain in excess of @xmath37 m@xmath11 of h@xmath5 may be very brief .",
    "thus , the probability of observing such a gas - rich galaxy may be exceedingly low .",
    "fourth , the universe may not have closure density , thus the scale of the universe may be larger than assumed for the above h@xmath5 mass calculations . even given this possibility , the h@xmath5 mass upper limits of the four best studied hzprgs are substantially less than the total stellar mass of a giant elliptical galaxy .",
    "from the high - redshift observations alone , it was not clear what role h@xmath5 may play in the radio activity seen in these galaxies . in addition , the number of radio galaxies observed prior to the hzprg co survey was very small , thus it was not clear if inaccurate generalizations based on observations of a few gas - rich lzprgs were being made for radio galaxies as a whole . of the several lzprgs that had been observed ,",
    "none of those detected had been f - r ii ( i.e. , edge - brightened radio morphology , typically observed to have @xmath38 w hz@xmath4 : fanaroff & riley 1974 ) galaxies like the hzprgs - all had been fc or f - r i ( i.e. , edge - darkened radio morphologies , typically with @xmath39 w hz@xmath4 ) galaxies .    over the last few years , considerable time has been devoted to investigating the h@xmath5 masses and morphologies , as well as the 2.2@xmath15 morphologies of a complete sample of 35 lzprgs with _ iras _ fluxes at 60@xmath40 m and/or 100@xmath40 m @xmath41 jy and @xmath42 ( evans et al .",
    "examples of some of the co emission lines detected are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the single - dish observations are being obtained using the nrao 12 m telescope , with follow - up interferometry of detected sources obtained using the owens valleys millimeter array .",
    "the 2.2@xmath15 imaging , obtained to look for evidence of isophotal irregularities , imbedded multiple nuclei and bridges hidden by dust at optical wavelengths , was done using the uh 2.2 m telescope .",
    "the results from this survey are that only 40% of the f - r ii galaxies show evidence of disturbed , high surface brightness features and multiple nuclei or close companions and that , aside from a co detection in 3c 293 ( @xmath43 : evans et al .",
    "1999 , figure 2 and 3 ) , none of the f - r ii sources have confirmed co detections .",
    "cygnus a , the protypical f - r ii radio galaxy , is among the galaxies that were not detected ; although it has an @xmath44 l@xmath11 , it has less than one - third the h@xmath5 mass of the milky way .",
    "the 2.2 @xmath15 image ( not shown ) supports this result - the host galaxy looks like an undisturbed elliptical galaxy .",
    "further , cygnus a and many other lzprgs have infrared colors suggestive of warm dust temperatures , indicating that most of the infrared luminosity may be coming from a small amount of dust heated by the agn ( i.e. , @xmath45 ) .",
    "in contrast , 86% of the fc and f - r i sources show evidence of disturbed , high surface brightness features and multiple nuclei or close companions , and 50% have been detected in co. such a dramatic contrast could simply suggest that the progenitors of f - r ii galaxies are gas - poor relative to the progenitors of fc and f - r i sources , or that some fc and f - r i sources evolve into f - r ii sources after the h@xmath5 has been consumed .",
    "the fundamental difference between f - r i and f - r ii sources may be the efficiency to which the jets propagate through the ism of the host galaxy . given this ,",
    "the lack of co detections in hzprgs is not surprising .",
    "if the apparent deficiency in the h@xmath5 masses of f - r ii relative to fc / f - r i galaxies is due to time evolution , galaxies such as 3c 293 may be transitional sources .",
    "the galaxy 3c 293 ( figure 3 ) has a moderately high infrared luminosity , a distorted disk - like infrared morphology with a companion , and several times the h@xmath5 mass of the milky way .",
    "the co emission is extended along the axis of the 2.2 @xmath15 disk and perpendicular to the radio jet , possibly because the jets have escaped through an axis unobscured by the putative nuclear torus .",
    "the co emission line ( figure 2 ) , has an absorption feature approximately 150 km s@xmath4 wide .",
    "if the width of the line is due solely to rotation , the absorption may occur from gas @xmath46 pc from the agn , approximately the radius of the dust torus observed in hst images of the radio galaxy ngc 4261 ( jaffe et al . 1996 ) .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank my collaborators d. sanders , j. mazzarella , p. solomon , d. downes , s. simon , j. surace , f. mirabel , and c. kramer .",
    "i also am grateful to the staffs of the nrao 12 m , iram 30 m , and uh 2.2 m telescopes , and the staff and postdocs of the owens valley millimeter array for their assistance during and after the observations presented here .",
