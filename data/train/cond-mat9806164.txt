    "there is only one electron per crystalline unit cell , and so a half - filled metallic conduction band would be expected .    with the discovery of the cuprate superconductors in 1986,@xcitethere has been a resurgence of interest in mott insulators .",
    "there are two broad classes of mott insulators , distinguished by the presence or absence of magnetic order.@xcite   more commonly spin rotational invariance is spontaneously broken , and long - range magnetic order , typically antiferromagnetic , is realized.@xcite  there are then low energy spin excitations , the spin one magnons .",

    "the ultimate nature of the underlying quantum ground state in this portion of the phase diagram - commonly called the _ pseudo - gap _ regime - is an intriguing puzzle .",

    "spin - liquid behavior results from the formation of singlet bond formation across the rungs of the ladder.@xcite almost without exception , theoretical studies of spin - liquids _ start _ by mapping to an appropriate spin - model , and the charge degrees of freedom are thereafter ignored .",

    "the form of the dual flux penetration will depend critically on whether the dual ginzburg - landau theory is type i or type ii . within a mean - field treatment",

    "the phase diagram of a clean three - dimensional type ii superconductor is well understood.@xcite  above the lower critical field , @xmath760 , flux tubes penetrate , and form an abrikosov flux lattice - usually triangular .",
    "as the applied field increases the flux tubes start overlapping , when their separation is closer than the penetration length . upon approaching the upper critical field @xmath761",
    "their cores start overlapping , the abrikosov flux lattice disappears , and the superconductivity is destroyed .",
    "these results hold equally well for our dual ginzburg - landau superconductor , except that now the direction parallel to the applied field is actually imaginary time .",
    "moreover , the ginzburg - landau order parameter describes quantum ( @xmath667 ) vortices , and the penetrating flux tubes are spinless charge @xmath57 holons . upon doping the nodal liquid with @xmath762 , charge",
    "is added to the 2d system , which corresponds to the penetration of dual magnetic flux . in this dual transcription ,",
    "the resulting abrikosov flux - lattice phase is a wigner crystal of holons , with one holon per real space unit cell of the lattice .",
    "upon further doping , at @xmath763 , the crystal of holons melts , and they condense - this is the d - wave superconductor .    in the holon wigner crystal phase , translational symmetry is spontaneously broken . however , in a real material the wigner crystal will have a preferred location , determined by impurities and perhaps crystal fields , which will tend to pin and immobilize the crystal . the resulting phase should be an electrical insulator .",
    "a striking and unusual feature of the holon wigner crystal is that it _",
    "co - exists _ with the nodal liquid .",
    "we thereby arrive at a description of a rather remarkable new phase of matter .",
    "a wigner crystal of doped holons co - exists with neutral gapless fermionic excitations  the nodons . in this co - existing phase , low energy spin and thermal properties will be dominated by the nodons .",

    "if our dual ginzburg - landau theory is type i , then analogous properties are expected .",

    "the system will break apart into co - existing  micro - phases \" of nodal liquid and d - wave superconductor .",
    "the configuration of the  micro - phases \" will be determined by a complicated competition between the coulomb energy and the ( positive ) energy of the domain walls . in practice",
    ", impurities will also probably play a very important role .",
    "the theoretical framework described above gives a skeletal description of the nodal liquid and , upon doping , the holon wigner crystal .",
    "there are many important issues which will need to be addressed in detail to see if this novel mott insulating phase gives a correct description of the low temperature pseudo - gap regime in the cuprates . at very low doping the cuprates",
    "are antiferromagnetic so it will clearly be necessary to incorporate magnetism into the theoretical framework .",
    "perhaps even more important is assessing the role of impurities , which are expected to have rather dramatic effects both on the holon wigner crystal and the gapless nodons .",
    "impurities will tend to disorder the wigner crystal and will scatter the nodons probably leading to a finite density of states and diffusive rather than ballistic motion . since the nodons carry spin but no charge , a rather exotic ",
    "spin metal \" phase is possible with a finite  spin conductivity \" ( but zero electrical conductivity ) even at zero temperature .",
    "it is also possible that the impurities will localize the nodons , perhaps leading to a random singlet phase or a spin glass .",
    "an additional complication is that some materials might exhibit phase separation upon doping ( type i rather than type ii behavior ) exhibiting micro - phase co - existence between the antiferromagnet and the d - wave superconductor , preempting the nodal liquid phase .",
    "it clearly remains as a future challenge to fully sort out the mysteries of the pseudo - gap regime .",
    "a more general theme of these notes is that novel spin liquid phases can sometimes be more conveniently viewed as descendents of superconductors - rather than the more traditional route via magnetism .",
    "one can imagine quantum disordering other exotic superconducting phases besides the @xmath0 state , to obtain new spin liquid phases .",
    "perhaps some of these phases will appear in other systems which exhibit finite angular momentum pairing , such as @xmath397 and the heavy fermion materials .",
