    "the interstellar hydroxyl radical ( oh ) is ubiquitous in the molecular clouds of our galaxy , and its spectral - line transitions have been widely studied over the last 30 yr .",
    "observations of the 1.6-ghz ground - state @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 , j=3/2 transitions have proven valuable in investigations of the physical and kinematic properties of the associated molecular clouds .",
    "oh maser emission found in or near many giant molecular clouds provides pointers for locations where star formation is occurring or possibly about to occur .",
    "attempts at similar studies of the magellanic clouds have been limited because little oh has been detected . in spite of several oh searches , previous detections , all in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , consisted of maser emission near two hii regions and oh absorption against the continuum emission of two other hii regions ( whiteoak & gardner 1976 ; caswell & haynes 1981 ; haynes & caswell 1981 ; gardner & whiteoak 1985 ; caswell 1995 ) .",
    "the oh deficiency may be related to the lower metallicity and stronger uv - radiation fields in the clouds compared with our galaxy .",
    "a limited number of other lmc masers have now been detected in 22-ghz transitions of h@xmath3o ( whiteoak et al .",
    "1983 ; whiteoak & gardner 1986 ) and 6-ghz transitions of ch@xmath4oh ( sinclair et al . 1992 ; ellingsen et al .",
    "1994 ; beasley et al . 1996 ) . except for caswell s ( 1995 ) observations ,",
    "the successful oh observations were obtained using the parkes 64-m radio telescope with a beamwidth of 12.5 arcmin . the angular resolution plus uncertain positional results",
    "have hindered comparison of the oh results with those for the other masers .",
    "to further our knowledge of the oh detections , and to extend the search to the locations of the other molecular masers , we have carried out a series of observations of the 1665- and 1667-mhz transitions of the oh ground state , using the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , operated by the australia telescope national facility , csiro .",
    "the observations also yielded the distribution of associated 1.6-ghz continuum emission .",
    "the atca observations were carried out in several periods between 1994 march and 1996 november .",
    "details of the instrument are given by frater & brooks ( 1992 ) .",
    "the antenna spacings ranged from 153 m to 6 km .",
    "the observations and data processing were made using standard procedures .",
    "an observing cycle was adopted in which 40-min target observations were bracketed by 3-min observations of phase calibrator pks 0823 - 500 ; in some cases two different targets shared the period between calibrator observations .",
    "this calibrator was also used to calibrate the spectral bandpass .",
    "flux - density was calibrated by observing pks 1934 - 638 ( adopted as the atca primary calibrator ) , for which a flux density of 14.16 jy was adopted .",
    "the correlator configuration consisted of 2048 channels extending over a 4-mhz band centered at 1665 mhz .",
    "this provided a channel spacing of 1.95 khz ( equivalent radial velocity of 0.35 km s@xmath5 ) .",
    "any 1665- and 1667-mhz transitions of oh in the lmc would be expected to appear in this band .",
    "the correlated spectral outputs from pairs of atca antennas were processed mostly at the paul wild observatory , narrabri using a package based on the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) produced by the us national radio astronomy observatory .",
    "after amplitude , phase and bandpass calibration , the linearly polarized outputs were combined into total intensities .",
    "contributions of continuum emission were removed from the spectral - line channels and stored in a separate database .",
    "the spectral - line database was split into databases for each oh transition , and the frequency scales converted into scales of heliocentric radial velocity .",
    "data in the final databases were fourier transformed , providing continuum and spectral - line images which were ` cleaned ' to remove side - lobe fringes caused by using only a limited number of baselines . in this process , ` uniform ' weighting was used for the imaging because it yielded the highest angular resolution . however , in some cases ` natural ' weighting was used to image the continuum emission because this is more effective in defining the faint extended emission .",
    "the selected targets included hii regions in which oh had been previously detected by whiteoak & gardner ( 1976 ) , caswell & haynes ( 1981 ) , haynes & caswell ( 1981 ) , and gardner & whiteoak ( 1985 ) : mrc 0510 - 689 ( mc23 , n105a ) , mrc 0539 - 691 ( mc74 , n157a ) , mrc 0540 - 696b ( mc76 , n160a ) , and mrc 0540 - 697a ( mc77 , n159 ) .",
    "it also included mrc 0513 - 694b ( mc24 , n113c ) , an hii region associated with the brightest h@xmath3o maser found in the lmc ( whiteoak & gardner 1986 ) , and iras 05011 - 6815 , a suspected ultra - compact hii region associated with a bright ch@xmath4oh maser ( beasley et al .",
    "oh maser emission or thermal absorption has been detected near all regions , except mrc 0539 - 691 , associated with the doradus nebula . in this case , the absorption detected with the parkes radio telescope is presumably extended , with a surface density too low to be detected with the atca .",
    "table 1 summarizes the oh results for the detected cases .",
    "the positional errors are given in parentheses .",
    "a discussion of the individual results follows .",
    "a ch@xmath4oh maser was detected towards this region by beasley et al .",
    "it showed three components located at ra(j2000 ) = 05@xmath601@xmath701@xmath8.85 , dec(j2000 ) = -68@xmath910@xmath1028@xmath11.3 , with heliocentric velocities in the range 265.6 - 267.9 km s@xmath5 . the object had been selected from the iras point source catalogue ( 1985 ) on the basis of the criteria suggested by wood & churchwell ( 1989 ) for ultra - compact hii ( uchii ) regions .    both 1665- and 1667-mhz oh maser emission",

    "the 1667-mhz spectrum contains a narrow feature at 266.2 km s@xmath5 with a peak flux density of 129 mjy beam@xmath5 , and possibly a fainter narrow feature at 268.7 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the position is similar to that of the 1665-mhz emission .",
    "the similarity of oh and ch@xmath4oh positions and velocities suggests a common origin for the molecules .",
    "the iras position differs from the oh maser position by 1@xmath8.06 in right ascension and -17@xmath11.8 in declination . a 1.6-ghz continuum image made with a beam size of 12.3",
    "x 5.8 arcsec@xmath0 showed no evidence of any continuum emission towards or near the maser , to an upper limit of 0.5 mjy beam@xmath5 .",

    "<S> the study has provided the first accurate positions for known 1665- and 1667-mhz oh masers as well as detecting several new masers . </S>",
    "<S> the regions all contain h@xmath3o or ch@xmath4oh masers but oh masers were detected in only four . </S>",
    "<S> the 1.6-ghz continuum emission was also imaged to investigate its spatial relationship to the associated oh maser . </S>",
    "<S> although some masers are close to compact continuum components , in other cases they are near the continuum distribution boundaries and perhaps have been created as a result of the hii region interacting with the surrounding interstellar medium .    </S>",
