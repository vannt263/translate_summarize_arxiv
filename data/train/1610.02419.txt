    "the charged particle multiplicity distribution is regarded as one of the basic global observable , which has been most widely measured and studied to understand the particle production mechanism in the hot and dense matter created in ultrarelativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "similarly , the transverse energy distribution of produced particles is treated as another global observable and is well suited for probing the qcd medium .",
    "both the observables are connected to the collision geometry , the entropy and initial energy density of the system created in heavy - ion collisions@xcite .",
    "various experimental measurements suggest that charged particle pseudorapidity density can be successfully used to study the expansion dynamics by landau hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "similarly , transverse energy can be used for understanding the longitudinal expansion of the system in the midrapidity and is subjected to the bjorken hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "this establishes a correlation between them and their measurements compliment each other to put constraints on the collision dynamics . the linear correlation between the mean charged particle multiplicity and the mean transverse energy suggests further the apparent equivalence .",
    "hence , they are known as the first measurements in heavy - ion collision experiments as global observables to study the underlying reaction mechanism for particle production and characterizing the collision system . in view of this , it is very crucial to understand the charged particle multiplicity and the transverse energy distribution measured in heavy - ion collisions .    before understanding a complex system like nucleus - nucleus collision , it is customary to understand the particle production mechanism in nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "recently , the weibull model of particle production based on the fragmentation and sequential branching mechanism have been successful in describing the overall feature of multiparticle production in hadronic and leptonic collisions@xcite .",
    "previously , it was emphasized that the main features of multiplicity distribution in nulceus nucleus collisions were just a consequence of the initial geometry of the collisons .",
    "as the nuclei are extended objects , the interaction volume depends on impact parameter of the collision system . however , it is impossible to measure the impact parameter of the collision directly in experiments .",
    "experimentally , these quantities are estimated by observing the number of particles or the transverse energy of the produced particles in the collision . to establish the one - to - one correspondence between the geometrical quantities , like impact parameter with measured charged particle multiplicity ,",
    "a monte carlo ( mc ) based galuber model is widely used .",
    "the glauber mc model @xcite , for p@xmath0a and a@xmath0a collisions described in ref.@xcite treats a nuclear collision as a superposition of binary nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "the volume of the initial overlap region is expressed in terms of the number of nucleons which have undergone one or more binary collisions with the nucleons of other nucleus .",
    "they are known as number of participant nucleons , @xmath1 .",
    "the number of binary collisions ( @xmath2 ) among the nucleons depends on inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross section ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "so by using the glauber mc model , both these quantities are calculated for a given value of the impact parameter for a realistic initial distribution of nucleons inside the nucleus .",
    "this geometrical approach helps to provide a consistent description of p@xmath0a , d@xmath0a , and a@xmath0a collisions when comparing data from different experiments or from different collision systems to theoretical calculations @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we have used the two component approach based on glauber model , combined with the weibull model of multiparticle production in hadronic interaction to simulate the multiplciity distribution in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the obtained distribution is compared to the experimental data measured at rhic and lhc energies .",
    "this weibull - glauber is similar to the fitting procedure adopted by alice experiment for the centrality determination in pb - pb collisions at 2.76 tev and 5.02 tev @xcite .",
    "we have also implemented the same formalism to describe the transverse energy distribution in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we also compare our results with hijing simulation results to validate our model and the proposal for determining the centrality classes of heavy - ion collision .",
    "the simple model aims to describe the qualitative features of the charged particle multiplicity and transverse energy distribution in heavy - ion collision . in the nucleus - nucleus collision , each of the wounded constituents , gives rise to an ancestor which then fragments into the final state hadrons .",
    "the first step in the process is to prepare a model of the two nuclei by defining the position of the nucleons in each nucleus .",
    "the monte carlo glauber model @xcite is used to compose two nuclei out of nucleons and simulate their collision process event - by - event .",
    "the nucleon position inside the nucleus is determined by the nuclear density function , modeled by the available functional forms ( fermi function , hulthn form , woods - saxon , uniform etc ) .",
    "the second step is to simulate a nuclear collision .",
    "the impact parameter of the collision is randomly selected from the geometrical distribution .",
    "the maximum value of the impact parameter is chosen large enough to simulate collisions until the interaction probability becomes zero .",
    "the nucleus - nucleus collision is treated as a sequence of independent binary nucleon - nucleon collisions , where the nucleons travel on straight - line trajectories .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath3 is assumed to be independent of the number of collisions a nucleon underwent previously , i.e. the same cross section is used for all successive collisions .",
    "two nucleons from different nuclei are assumed to collide if the relative transverse distance between centers is less than the distance corresponding to the @xmath3 value .",
    "so @xmath3 is one of the controlling parameters of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "thus the value of @xmath3 given as an another input for the mc glauber model , which depends on the collision energy as used by various experiments @xcite .",
    "the glauber mc model provides the number of participant , @xmath1 , and the number of binary collisions , @xmath2 , for an event with a given impact parameter and collisions energy . to determine the particle multiplicity for a single event",
    ", one defines the number of independent sources emitting particles , also known as ` ancestors ' @xcite .",
    "the number of ancestors can be parametrized by assuming suitable dependence on @xmath1 and @xmath2 as the final multiplicity of an event depends on the impact parameter of the collision .",
    "the event multiplicity ( or transverse energy ) is expected to scale with @xmath1 where the particle production is dominated by soft processes while the @xmath2 scaling predominates where hard processes dominate over soft particle production @xcite .",
    "we have assumed a two - component approach as prescribed in ref.@xcite where the number of ancestors have been parametrized in terms of both @xmath1 and @xmath2 as the following @xmath4    the aforementioned dependence takes care of the relative contribution ( @xmath5 ) of both hard and soft processes in the final multiplicity .",
    "the approach as described by eq.[ancestordep ] in convolution with negative binomial distribution ( nbd ) has been very successful in describing the charged particle multiplicity densities at rhic and lhc energies @xcite .",
    "but in our model , the charged particle multiplicity per nucleon - nucleon collisions is parametrized by the weibull distribution instead of nbd .",
    "this latter assumption is motivated by the fact that in minimum bias pp ( @xmath6 ) collisions , the charged particle multiplicity distribution is better described by the weibull function than the nbd for a wide range of energies @xcite .",
    "thus it explains the appropriateness of choosing weibull function over the traditional nbd .",
    "the probability of producing @xmath7 particles per ancestor is given by the two parameter weibull distribution    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is related to the mean multiplicity per ancestor and @xmath10 is related to the production dynamics .",
    "for each event , the weibull distribution is randomly sampled for @xmath11 times to obtain the number of particles produced in that event .",
    "the process is repeated for various values of @xmath9 , @xmath10 and the two - component parameter @xmath5 to simulate an experimental multiplicity ( or transverse energy ) distribution , which can be compared with measured experimental data .",
    "we use our model to describe the charged particle multiplicity and transverse energy distribution measured by various experimental facilities at rhic and lhc energies .",
    "the model fit to the charged particle multiplicity distribution measured in the mid - rapidity in au@xmath0au collisions at @xmath12 = 200 gev by star tpc detector @xcite is shown in figure [ midrapauau ] . in alice experiment ,",
    "the amplitude of vzero detector is proportional to the charged particle multiplicity .",
    "so we fit our model with the vezro detector amplitude measured in pb@xmath0pb collisions at @xmath12 = 2.76 tev by alice experiment @xcite , which is shown in figure [ midrappbpb ] .",
    "it can be seen from figure [ midrapauau ] and figure [ midrappbpb ] that the distributions obtained from the above model successfully describes the charged particle multiplicity distribution in au@xmath0au and pb@xmath0pb collisions at @xmath12 = 200 gev and 2.76 tev , respectively .     for au@xmath0au collisions at @xmath12 = 200 gev @xcite .",

    "we also fit our model to the minimum - bias transverse energy distribution measured by phenix experiment in au@xmath0au collisions at @xmath12 = 200 gev as shown in figure [ phenixtranse ] @xcite .",
    "recently , the transverse energy distribution was also measured by alice experiment for pb@xmath0pb collisions at @xmath12 = 2.76 tev @xcite .",
    "figure [ aliceet ] compares the @xmath13 distribution generated by our model with that obtained in pb@xmath0pb collisions at 2.76 tev . from the above comparisons",
    ", one can observe that the two - component weibull - glauber approach provides an excellent description of the measured minimum bias data for charged particle multiplicity and transverse energy distribution .",

    "the experimental charged particle multiplicity distribution can be divided into different classes of geometrical collision by defining sharp cuts in multiplicity or any other suitable detector variable to define the same .",
    "these centrality classes correspond to well - defined intervals of hadronic cross - section .",
    "so it is very important to determine the correct centrality class to study various physics observables as a function of centrality or impact parameter and to compare the same with different energies of various heavy - ion experiments .",
    "pb collisions at @xmath12 = 2.76 tev is shown by blue line .",

    "the same was simulated using the weibull - glauber model .",
    "figure [ midraphijing ] shows the comparison of the multiplicity distribution obtained using hijing to the one simulated using weibull - glauber approach .",
    "this creates a relationship between an experimental observable and the phenomenological model of particle multiplicity in nucleus - nucleus collisions using weibull - glauber approach . a given centrality class , defined by sharp cuts in the geometrical properties ( like @xmath1 , @xmath2 , impact paramter(@xmath14 ) , etc . ) in the hijing multiplicity distribution corresponds to the same centrality class obtained using weibull - glauber model .",
    "now one can estimate the mean number of participants , @xmath15 and the mean number of binary collisions , @xmath16 , for a given centrality class by applying sharp cuts in impact parameter in the generated multiplicity distribution by weibull - glauber approach .",
