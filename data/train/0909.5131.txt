    "[ fig1](b ) shows a typical example of an experimentally measured intensity time - series @xmath10 of a polystyrene particle with radius @xmath11 in water .    due to the evanescent illumination",
    ", the intensity of the light scattered by the particle is quite sensitive to the particle - wall distance .",
    "if the corresponding intensity - distance relation @xmath2 is known ( and monotonic ) , the vertical component of the particles trajectory @xmath12 can be deduced from @xmath10 . to obtain @xmath2 ,",
    "it is in principle required to solve a rather complex mie scattering problem , i.e. the scattering of a micron - sized colloidal particle under evanescent illumination close to a surface @xcite , where multiple reflections between the particle and the substrate and mie resonances must be accounted for @xcite .",
    "when such effects can be neglected , the scattering intensity is proportional to the evanescent field intensity and , since the latter decays exponentially , tirm data are typically analyzed using a purely exponential @xmath13 @xcite ( fig .",

    "the second term describes the effective gravitational contributions with @xmath26 and @xmath27 the particle and solvent density and @xmath28 the gravitational acceleration constant ; @xmath29 takes into account additional optical forces , which may result from a vertically incident laser beam often employed as a two - dimensional optical trap to reduce the lateral motion of the particle @xcite .",
    "depending on the experimental conditions , additional interactions , such as depletion or van der waals forces , may arise .    despite the broad range of phenomena that have successfully been addressed with tirm",
    ", most studies have been carried out with small penetration depths ( at most @xmath30 ) , and have therefore been limited to rather small particle - substrate distances @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , no tirm studies on highly reflecting walls , e.g. gold surfaces , have been reported , although such surfaces are interesting since they can support surface plasmons enhancing the evanescent field @xcite and the optical near - field radiation forces @xcite . furthermore , gold coatings can be easily functionalized @xcite , which would allow to apply tirm to e.g. biological systems .",
    "the reason for these limitations is the aforementioned problem to obtain a reliable @xmath2 relationship under these conditions .",
    "for example , it has been demonstrated that large penetration depths ( e.g. above @xmath31 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) increase the multiple optical reflections between the particle and the wall , which in turn leads to a non - exponential @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "experiments combining tirm and afm found deviations from simple exponential behaviour very close to the wall even for shorter penetration depths @xcite . in principle , such effects can be included into elaborate scattering models , however , this requires precise knowledge of the system properties and , in particular , of the refractive indices of particle , wall , and liquid medium @xcite .",
    "since the latter are prone to significant uncertainties ( in particular for the colloidal particles ) , the application of tirm under such conditions remains inaccurate .    here ,",
    "we introduce a method to experimentally determine @xmath2 by making solely use of the experimentally acquired @xmath10 and of the distance - dependent hydrodynamic interactions between the particle and the wall .",
    "in particular , no knowledge about the shape of the potential @xmath3 is required .",
    "we demonstrate the capability of this method by experiments and simulations , and we also apply it to experimental conditions with long penetration depths ( @xmath32 ) and even with highly reflective gold surfaces .",
    "near a wall ( eq . ( [ brennerformula])).,width=283 ]    colloidal particles immersed in a solvent undergo brownian motion due to collisions with solvent molecules .",
    "this erratic motion leads to particle diffusion with the stokes - einstein diffusion coefficient @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the shear viscosity of the liquid .",
    "it is well known that this bulk diffusion coefficient decreases close to a wall due to hydrodynamic interactions . from the solution of the creeping flow equations for a spherical particle in motion near a wall assuming nonslip boundary conditions and negligible inertial effects , one obtains for the diffusion coefficient in the vertical direction @xcite , @xmath35 where @xmath36 $ ] and @xmath37 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , @xmath38 first increases with @xmath0 approaching the corresponding bulk value at a distance of several particle radii away from the wall .",

    "one has to calculate the conditional msd given that the particle is at time @xmath41 at position @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath42 where the equality is valid for @xmath43 ; in such limit , this expression is only determined by the particle diffusion even if the particle is exposed to an external potential @xmath3 . from this follows that @xmath44 can be directly obtained from the particle s trajectory @xmath45 eq .
