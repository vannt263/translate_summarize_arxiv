    "charge symmetry breaking ( csb ) in nuclear physics is primarily identified by considering the difference between @xmath14 and @xmath15 scattering lengths , or the binding - energy difference between the mirror nuclei @xmath16h and @xmath16he @xcite . in these nuclei ,",
    "about 70 kev out of the coulomb - dominated 764  kev binding - energy difference is commonly attributed to csb which can be explained either by @xmath17 mixing in one - boson exchange models of the @xmath18 interaction , or by considering @xmath19 intermediate - state mass differences in models limited to pseudoscalar meson exchanges @xcite .    in @xmath0 hypernuclei , in contrast , csb appears to be considerably stronger , judging by the binding - energy difference @xmath20=0.35@xmath210.06  mev deduced from the level diagram of the mirror hypernuclei ( ,  ) in fig .",

    "csb contributions to @xmath27 from one- and two - pion exchange interactions in @xmath37 coupled - channel calculations @xcite with hyperons @xmath38 amount to as much as 100  kev ; this holds for the obe - based nijmegen nsc97 models @xcite which are widely used in @xmath0-hypernuclear structure calculations .. we note that the strength of csb contributions in this work , on p.  2236 , is inflated erroneously by a factor @xmath39 , about 3.7 for pion exchange , which might have propagated into some of the calculations claiming to have resolved the csb puzzle for @xmath20 using nsc89 . ]",
    "binding energies of ground states in @xmath9-shell mirror @xmath0 hypernuclei , determined from emulsion studies @xcite , suggest much weaker csb effects than for @xmath5 , with values of @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) consistent with zero for @xmath42 and somewhat negative beyond @xcite . accommodating @xmath43 values in the @xmath9 shell with @xmath31 by using reasonable phenomenological csb interactions is impossible , as demonstrated in recent four - body cluster - model calculations of @xmath9-shell @xmath0 hypernuclei  @xcite .",
    "this difficulty may be connected to the absence of explicit @xmath44 coupling in these cluster - model calculations , given that such explicit coupling was shown to generate non - negligible csb contributions to @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "it is our purpose in this note to use a schematic @xmath7 coupling model , proposed by akaishi et al .",

    "[ sec : csb ] , we update the original treatment by dalitz and von hippel @xcite of the @xmath6 mixing mechanism for generating csb one - pion exchange contributions in @xmath0 hypernuclei , linking it to the strong - interaction @xmath44 coupling model employed in this work .",
    "our csb calculations for the @xmath5 hypernuclei are sketched in sect .",
    "[ sec : s - shell ] and their results are compared with those reported in several @xmath37 four - body calculations @xcite . finally , csb contributions in @xmath9-shell mirror @xmath0 hypernuclei , evaluated here for the first time , are reported in sect .",
    "[ sec : p - shell ] .",
    "the @xmath46 isoscalar nature of the @xmath0 hyperon forbids it to emit or absorb a single pion , and hence there is no one - pion exchange ( ope ) contribution to the @xmath47 strong interaction .",
    "however , by allowing for @xmath6 mixing in su(3 ) , a csb ope contribution arises @xcite with @xmath48 coupling constant @xmath49 where the matrix element of the mass mixing operator @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 the resulting csb ope potential is given by @xmath52y(r ) ,   \\label{eq : ope}\\ ] ] where the z component of the isospin pauli matrix @xmath53 assumes the values @xmath54 on protons and neutrons , respectively , @xmath55 is a yukawa form , and the tensor contribution is specified by @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ope ] ) , the transition @xmath57 was made in accordance with nsc models , using @xmath58 from nsc89 , table iv in ref  @xcite .    since pauli - spin @xmath59 and @xmath60 hold in ( @xmath32 ) and in ( @xmath32 ) , respectively , the csb potential ( [ eq : ope ] ) which is linear in the nucleon spin gives no contribution from these same - charge nucleons .",
    "therefore @xmath61 owing to the odd nucleon in these hypernuclei , respectively , and since @xmath62 holds for this odd nucleon , one gets a _ positive _ @xmath43 contribution from the central spin - spin part which provides the only nonvanishing contribution for simple @xmath63 wavefunctions . for the @xmath32 wavefunction used by dalitz and von hippel @xcite , and updating the values of the coupling constants used in their work to those used here",
    ", one gets @xmath64  kev , a substantial single contribution with respect to @xmath65  kev .",
    "the @xmath6 mixing mechanism gives rise also to a variety of ( e.g. @xmath66 ) meson exchanges other than ope .",
    "in baryon - baryon models that consider _ explicitly _ the strong - interaction @xmath7 coupling , the matrix element of @xmath67 is related to a suitably chosen strong - interaction isospin @xmath68 matrix element @xmath69 by generalizing eq .",

    "it was shown in this work how a relatively large csb contribution of order 250  kev arises in ( @xmath75 ) coupling models based on akaishi s central - interaction @xmath92-matrix calculations in @xmath8-shell hypernuclei @xcite , coming close to the binding energy difference @xmath3()@xmath2@xmath3 ( )  @xmath93  kev deduced from emulsion studies @xcite .",
    "it was also argued that the reason for most of the @xmath37 coupled - channel calculations done so far to come out considerably behind , with 100  kev at most by using nsc97@xmath94 , is that their @xmath75 channel coupling is dominated by strong tensor interaction terms . in this sense ,",
    "the csb - dominated large value of @xmath95 places a powerful constraint on the strong - interaction @xmath87 dynamics .    in spite of the schematic nature of the present ( @xmath75 ) coupling model of the @xmath5 hypernuclei , which undoubtedly does not match the high standards of solving coupled - channel four - body problems , this model has the invaluable advantage of enabling a fairly simple application to heavier hypernuclei , where it was shown to reproduce successfully the main csb features as disclosed from the several measured binding energy differences in @xmath9-shell mirror hypernuclei .",
    "more quantitative work , particularly for the  mirror hypernuclei , has to be done in order to confirm the trends established here in the beginning of the @xmath9 shell upon relying exclusively on data reported from emulsion studies .",
