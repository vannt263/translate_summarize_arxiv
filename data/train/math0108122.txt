    "this paper proves the convergence of the finite difference method introduced in @xcite for the poisson equation with discontinuous coefficients and given interfacial jumps .",
    "based on the ghost fluid method ( gfm ) of @xcite , see also @xcite , @xcite , the finite difference method is simple , efficient and robust .",
    "one of the novelties , and advantages , of the method is the arm - by - arm splitting technique which makes the method in multi - dimension as simple as in one - dimension .",
    "another advantage is that the resulting linear system of the method is the same as the linear system obtained from the simplest standard five point stencil finite difference method for the poisson equation without discontinuous coefficients or given interfacial jumps .",
    "therefore the resulting linear system is symmetric and positive definite and can be efficiently solved .",
    "inherited from the gfm , this finite difference method captures the sharp solution profile at the interfaces without smearing .",
    "this is a necessity in the development of effective schemes for problems involving interfaces .",
    "a variety of other approaches to problems with interfaces have been taken , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "an important application of the method here is for hele - shaw flow , see @xcite .",
    "the convergence proof starts with the formulation of the problem , in terms of a uniformly elliptic bilinear form .",
    "existence and uniqueness of a weak solution @xmath0 follow immediately using elementary functional analysis .",
    "the solution space is the same as @xmath1 except with a different , but equivalent , inner product induced by the bilinear form .",
    "discretizing this weak formulation in a natural way results a discrete weak problem , which is equivalent to the finite different method in @xcite .",
    "as expected , the discrete weak formulation inherits the structural conditions ( uniform boundedness , extension , consistency ) in the discrete sense , hence existence , uniqueness , and uniform boundedness of the family @xmath2 of discrete solution hold .",
    "we then provide an abstract framework for the convergence proof .",
    "in addition to the uniform structural conditions for the weak problem and its discretizations , we postulate the existence of a uniformly bounded family of extension operators @xmath3 from the discrete spaces to the solution space , which satisfy a strong approximation property .",
    "this natural assumption implies that as the grid size @xmath4 goes to zero the image of the discrete space fills out the entire solution space . finally , we impose weak consistency of the discrete problem with the original problem . under these assumptions ,",
    "the sequence of extended weak solutions @xmath5 converges weakly to the solution @xmath0 in @xmath1 .",
    "guided by the abstract framework , we establish the converge of the finite difference scheme of @xcite .",
    "there is a similarity between the standard convergence proof of finite element methods and our approach .",
    "both of them use structural conditions . for finite element methods , the structural conditions and weak consistency",
    "are inherited directly from the weak problem for the pde because the discrete bilinear forms are obtained by restriction to finite dimensional subspaces .",
    "lemma then says that the extended discrete solution is the closest function in the finite dimensional subspace to the true solution .",
    "this reduces convergence and error estimation to a problem in approximation theory . for finite difference methods , further approximations",
    "are made so that the discrete problem can not be obtained by restriction to a finite dimensional subspace . in our case",
    ", the difference between the finite difference scheme and the finite element method is that point values of the coefficients are used rather than cell averages .",
    "because the coefficients in our problem are discontinuous , the solution lies only in @xmath1 and not @xmath6 , and therefore , we obtain convergence , but without a rate .",
    "consider a bounded domain , @xmath7 , with smooth boundary , @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 be a smooth interface of co - dimension @xmath10 , represented by the zero level - set of a smooth function @xmath11 , which is a signed distance function of the interface locally .",
    "we assume that @xmath12 divides @xmath13 into disjoint subdomains , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , with @xmath16 .",
    "thus , we may write @xmath17 .",
    "the unit normal vector of the interface is @xmath18 , for @xmath19 , pointing from @xmath20 to @xmath21 .",
    "we seek solutions of the variable coefficient poisson equation away from the interface given by    @xmath22    in which @xmath23 denotes the spatial variables and @xmath24 is the gradient operator .",
    "the coefficient @xmath25 is assumed to be a positive definite , symmetric @xmath26 matrix , the components of which are continuously differentiable on the closure of each disjoint subdomain , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , but they may be discontinuous across the interface @xmath29 .",
    "it follows that there are positive constants @xmath30 with @xmath31 , where @xmath32 stands for the @xmath26 identity matrix .",
    "we suppose that on the interface , @xmath33 assumes the limiting values from within @xmath20 . the right - hand side @xmath34 is assumed to lie in @xmath35 .",
