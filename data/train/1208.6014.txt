    "the introduction of the new code for stellar evolution , mesa  @xcite ( modules for experiments in stellar astrophysics ) represented somewhat of a revolution in the field of computational stellar evolution .",
    "mesa is a one - dimensional stellar evolution code , organized in independent modules and continually updated .",
    "the code can evolve stars with a very wide range of initial masses and metallicities ; it allows the specification of many parameters , for example , convection mechanism , mass loss , etc . , and it can overcome difficulties typical of the previous stellar evolutionary codes .",
    "notably , it can run a low mass star through the he - flash region .",
    "all these aspects and the fact that the code is publicly available  @xcite has made mesa extremely popular among astrophysicists and other physicists interested in stellar evolution and in how stars respond to new models of particle interactions .",
    "being publicly available , mesa is widely accessible and is continually tested by hundreds of scientists and students all over the world . in addition , several researchers have created new codes and routines to improve it and to simplify its use  @xcite .",
    "a mesa run produces a very large amount of data on the life and structure of the star .",
    "this information is saved in several files : the file `` star.log '' includes global information about the star at different times whereas a large number of _ profiles _ ( named `` log@xmath0.data '' , where @xmath0 is an integer ) , contain detailed information about the profile of the star , each file referring to a specific age .",
    "though it is relatively easy , and for some purposes sufficient , to analyze the file `` star.log '' , a complete analysis of the mesa output , which includes in some cases hundreds of profiles , is much more challenging .",
    "in particular , to analyze the detailed structure of a star at a certain age , one should select the corresponding profile by reading the age of each of them ( the information is provided in the @xmath1 row of `` log@xmath0.data '' ) .",
    "alternatively , one should read the _ model number _ corresponding to a certain age in the first column of the file `` star.log '' , and then look for the log number associated with that age in the file `` profile.index '' .",
    "both ways are long and , in general , not very practical .",
    "another common problem is reading the age of a star from its position in the hr diagram ( or any other plot which does not show the age explicitly , e.g. , the _ central temperature - central density _ diagram ) .",
    "it would be useful to have a quick access to that information and , at the same time , to know which of the many profiles describes the structure of the star at that age .",
    "here we describe a graphical interface , mesaface , which we created to address problems like the ones described above and , in general , to provide fast and simple access to _ all the information _ contained in the output of a mesa run , including all the profiles .",
    "mesaface is a very intuitive , efficient , and easy - to - use dynamical interface , which allows the selection of the information to be shown through buttons and menus and the age of the star to be selected through a slidebar .",
    "the code is written in mathematica and has been tested with mathematica 7 and 8 . however , a knowledge of mathematica is not strictly necessary to use the interface .",
    "mesaface needs to access the mesa output data which , in a standard mesa run , are saved in the folder /work / logs .",
    "the data can also be downloaded directly from the web . possibly soon",
    ", the results from some standard runs will be available from a dedicated web space .",
    "after the data has been loaded , mesaface presents a graphical interface structured in three vertically organized panels :    * a history plot panel ; * a profile plot panel ; * an information panel .",
    "all the _ controls _ ( buttons , menus , check - boxes , etc . )",
    "are contained on the left side of the interface .",
    "the user can decide what to plot and can change the age of the star by using these controls while the information shown on the right side is dynamically updated .",
    "several aspects of the panels and graphs , for example , the color and style of the lines , can be customized by the user . a separate user manual  @xcite explains in detail how to do that .    in this paper , we describe in detail the structure of the mesaface code and how it accesses , manipulates , and presents the data .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following : we begin with a brief summary of the mesa output , in section [ sec : briefdescriptionofthemesaoutput ] .",
    "later , in section [ sec : thestructureofmf ] , we give a basic description of the general structure of the mesaface code . in section [ sec : downloadandorganizationofthefiles ] , we describe with more details how mesaface loads and organizes the files . in section [ sec :",
    "theinterface ] , we discuss how it creates the dynamical interface and visualizes the data .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] we conclude with some overall comments .    a note on the style .",
    "we will use the ` typewriter ` style for the content of the mathematica notebook , `` quotes '' for the name of the mesa files , and * bold face * for the names of the controls in the interface .",
    "mesa is a one - dimensional stellar evolution code . the output data is parameterized by the value of the star age and the radial distance from the star center .",
    "most of the output data is organized in a large number of _ profiles _ ( `` log@xmath0.data '' files , with @xmath0 an integer ) .",
    "the main section of each profile is a table with data referring to a particular age and each row referring to a particular _ zone _ in the star .",
    "different zones correspond to different distances from the center .",
    "besides the profiles , mesa also produces a `` star.log '' file which includes global information about the star at different times , and a `` profiles.index '' which provides a useful connection between the profiles and `` star.log '' .",
    "all these files are created during a mesa run and , by default , are contained in the log folder of the star / work directory .",
    "below is a brief description of the mesa output files . for more information , cfr . the mesa literature@xcite .",
    "the mesa output folder contains 1 file `` star.log '' , a large number of _ profiles _ , 1 file , `` profiles.index '' .    *",
    "the file `` star.log '' includes global information about the star at different times .",
    "the second and third row of this file include the names ( row 2 ) and values ( row 3 ) of some physical quantities characterizing the star , for example its initial mass and metallicity .",
    "this information is accessible from the interface by selecting the * general * radio button in the general info panel of the interface ( see section [ sec : visualization of the data ] ) .",
    "+ the sixth row contains the names of some _ age - dependent _ physical quantities , such as effective temperature or central density , and all the rows below that show the values of these quantities at different ages .",
    "each row is indexed by a different _ model_number _ and represents a different age of the star . *",
    "the _ profiles _ ( `` log@xmath0.data '' files ) contain detailed information about the structure of the star , each file referring to a specific age .",
    "here , @xmath0 is the _ log file number _ , also referred to as the _ log _ or _ profile number_. + the second and third row of these files include the names ( row 2 ) and values ( row 3 ) of some physical quantities characterizing the particular profile , for example the age of the star .",
    "this information is accessible from the interface by selecting the * detailed * radio button in the general info panel of the interface ( see section [ sec : visualization of the data ] ) .",
    "+ the sixth row contains the names of some _ position - dependent _ physical quantities , such as temperature or density , and all the rows below that show the values of these quantities in the different zones . *",
    "the file `` profiles.index '' is an index of the `` log@xmath0.data '' files .",
    "it has three columns .",
    "the most interesting ( for our purpose ) are the first and the third .",
    "the first contains the _ model_number _ , which indicates a specific row of the file `` star.log '' ( each row has a different _ model_number _ ) .",
    "the third column has the _ log file number_. in this way `` profiles.index '' provides a link among the various `` log@xmath0.data '' and `` star.log '' .    the number of different profiles and the amount and kind of information in each file depend on the particular run .",
    "the mesaface code contains two scripts , labeled as ` ( * script 1  * ) ` and ` ( * script 2  * ) ` , which should be run consecutively .    the first script extracts all the data from a mesa run and organizes them into tables easily accessible by the interface ( see section [ sec : downloadandorganizationofthefiles ] ) .",
    "although extracting all the mesa output at once may be slow , after that , the interface can access all the data very quickly , allowing a dynamical manipulation and visualization of the information .",
    "the interface is created by the second script , labeled ` ( * script 2  * ) ` in the code and described in section [ sec : structureofthesecondscript ] and [ sec : theinterface ] .",
    "the choice to have two scripts is a practical one : the second script , which normally runs in no more than a second or so , allows several customizations of the interface , for example it allows the user to set the style of the graphs . having this script separated from the first one allows the user to change some features in the interface or in the plot style without having to download the data each time .",
    "the first script can be divided in two sections :    1 .",
    "the first section , which ends before the definition of the function ` age ` , sets the path to the folder with the mesa output data and downloads the data .",
    "2 .   the second section organizes the data ( see section [ sec : downloadandorganizationofthefiles ] ) .",
    "the variable ` slash ` allows mathematica to read the location of the output files with different operating systems .",
    "if the output data are on the web , the variable ` slash ` has to be set equal to ` / ` .",
    "the second script can be divided into three main sections :    1 .",
    "the section contained within the comment lines ` ( * general settings  * ) ` and ` ( * do nt change  * ) ` at the beginning of the second script allows the user to customize the interface . in this section , it is possible to define the style of the graphs , the labels , and the buttons to show in the interface .",
    "2 .   the section below the comment line ` ( * plot and info section * ) ` produces the information to be presented in the three vertical panels on the right hand side of the interface ( see section  [ sec : visualization of the data ] ) .",
    "3 .   the section after the comment line ` ( * image size  * ) ` creates and manages the controls to be shown on the left hand side of the interface ( see section  [ sec : descriptionofthecontrolsvariables ] ) .",
    "most of the variables used in the scripts are local ( they are visible only within the script ) .",
    "a variable is made local by including it in the curly brackets at the beginning of the ` module ` command .",
    "however , some variables defined in the first script need to be accessed by the second script and , therefore , they can not be defined locally .",
    "these global variables are :    * ` path ` : it defines the path to the folder with the mesa output data . * ` star ` : it is a table and contains the content of the file `` star.log '' . * ` log[lognumber ] ` : it is an array of tables with the content of the profiles . `",
    "lognumber ` is an index equal to the _ log file number _ ( see section [ sec : briefdescriptionofthemesaoutput ] ) .",
    "the table ` log[n ] ` corresponds to the file `` log@xmath0.data '' . *",
    "` profiles ` : it is a table and contains the content of the file `` profiles.index '' .",
    "* ` logage ` : it is a two column table with , respectively , the log file number and the star age of each profile . * ` maxmodellength ` : it is an integer equal to the number of lines of the profile which has the largest number of lines .",
    "if it is necessary to debug or to use a result outside a mesaface session , a local variable can be made global by taking it out of the list in the curly brackets at the beginning of the ` module ` command .    in general",
    ", however , it is not recommended to use nonlocal variables outside mesaface during a session .",
    "the goal of mesaface is to provide a way to access the data _ dynamically_. in order to do that , mesaface downloads all the data at once , either from the hard - drive or from the web , and saves it in particular variables .",
    "this may be a rather slow process , especially if the data are to be extracted directly from a web location .",
    "after the data is downloaded , however , the access to the information is very fast .",
    "the progress in downloading is indicated : a numerical value represents the actual number of downloaded profiles while a progress - bar shows the relative progress .",
    "the job of the first script of mesaface is just to download and organize the mesa output data .",
    "mathematica looks in the folder defined by the variable ` path ` for all the files with names `` star.log '' , `` profiles.index '' and `` log@xmath0.data '' ( it is essential that the output files have those names , as it is for a default run ) .",
    "the variable ` path ` can point to a folder on the hard drive or on the web .",
    "the files `` star.log '' and `` profiles.index '' are saved ( as tables ) respectively in the variable ` star ` and ` profiles ` .",
    "analogously , the `` log@xmath0.data '' files are saved in the array of tables ` log[indx ] ` , where ` indx ` is the _ log number _ @xmath0 .",
    "for example , the file `` log@xmath2.data '' is saved as ` log[33 ] ` .",
    "one of the main features of mesaface is to allow an easy selection of the profile corresponding to a certain age . to do that",
    ", the first script organizes the profiles in order of age in the table ` logage ` , with the _ log number _ in column 1 and the star age in column 2 .",
    "each time ` starage ` is selected , mathematica uses the table ` logage ` to find the corresponding _ log file number _ , and saves it in the variable ` model ` : @xmath5 , starage][[1 , 1 ] ] , 1 ] ] ; }      \\end{array}\\ ] ] in addition , if the check - box * show age in history plot * is checked , mesaface finds which line of the file `` star.log '' corresponds to the age selected : @xmath6[[all , 3 ] ] , } \\\\&\\texttt{model][[1 , 1 ] ] + 1 ,     1]];}\\\\ & \\\\ & \\texttt{indexage = position[drop[star , 6][[all , 1 ] ] , modelnumber]}\\\\&\\texttt{[[1 , 1 ] ] ; }     \\end{array}\\ ] ] here , ` modelnumber ` is equal to the _ model number _ discussed above ( see section [ sec : briefdescriptionofthemesaoutput ] ) .",
    "its value is reported in the first column of `` profile.index '' and in the first column of `` star.log '' .    the variable ` indexage ` , instead , is equal to the the row number of `` star.log '' ( after its first 6 lines are dropped ) corresponding to the _ model number _ ( and therefore the age of the star ) .",
    "this value is used to identify the position of the age of the current profile in the history plots , providing a link between the * history plots * and * profile plots * panels .",
    "running the second script produces a graphical interface in which the controls , located on the right hand side , allow the user to choose what kind of information to show in the visualization panels to the right .",
    "the controls are coded in the section of the second script which follows the comment line ` ( * beginning of the proper dynamical part * ) ` .",
    "they are described by variables and are normally nested in double curly brackets .",
    "for example , the line : @xmath7 describes a variable whose value can be set by a popup - menu  @xcite .",
    "the first controls in each of the three sections of the interface are _",
    "radio button_-type controls which allow the user to choose the kind of plot ( top two panels ) or information ( bottom panel ) to show .",
    "they are coded in the section of the script below the comment line ` ( *  beginning of the proper dynamical part  * ) ` , at the beginning of the ` ( *  history plot section  * ) ` , the ` ( *  profile plot section  * ) ` , and the ` ( *  info section  * ) ` : @xmath8\\},}\\\\    & \\texttt{\\{\"customized \" , \" hr \" , \" centralabundances \" , \" burnings\"\\ } , }   \\\\    & \\texttt{controltype - > radiobuttonbar\\},}\\\\      & \\\\        & \\texttt{\\{\\{profiletype , \" custom \" , style[\"type of plot \" , 12 , bold]\\},}\\\\    & \\texttt{\\{\"custom \" , \" abundances \" , \" reactions\"\\ } ,   } \\\\    & \\texttt{controltype - > radiobuttonbar\\},}\\\\      & \\\\        & \\texttt{\\{\\{info , \" path \" , \" \" \\},\\{\"path \" , \" general \" , \" detailed\"\\},}\\\\    &   \\texttt{controltype - > radiobuttonbar\\ } , }      \\end{array}\\ ] ] these controls allow the user to set the _ string _ value of ` plottype ` , ` profiletype ` , and ` info ` .    when these variables are set at their default values , the quantities to be plotted are represented by the string - valued variables ` xh ` and `",
    "yh ` , for the @xmath9 and @xmath10coordinates of the history plots and ` xp ` and ` yp ` , for the @xmath9 and @xmath10coordinates of the profile plots .",
    "the possible values of ` xh ` and ` yh ` are the elements in the @xmath11 row of the file `` star.log '' . the possible values of ` xp ` and ` yp ` are the elements in the @xmath11 row of any of the files `` log@xmath0.data '' .",
    "all these options are accessible to the user through popup menus and buttons .",
    "the lists of buttons to show in the interface are coded in the ` ( * buttons to show * ) ` section of the code : @xmath12 the first element of each list gives the default value of the corresponding variable .",
    "the plot functions ` customized ` and ` custom ` , plot the values in the two columns defined by ` xh ` and ` yh ` of the file `` star.log '' ( after dropping the first 6 rows ) and the values in the two columns defined by ` xp ` and ` yp ` of the current file `` log@xmath0.data '' ( again , after dropping the first 6 rows ) respectively .",
    "the other plot functions show specific columns of the files `` star.log '' or `` log@xmath0.data '' in order to produce some standard plots ( see section [ sec : visualization of the data ] ) .    regardless of the value of the ` plottype ` and ` profiletype ` variables , the following parameters define some characteristics of the graphs :    * ` cx ` , ` cy ` , ` dx ` , ` dy ` represent the scale factors for , respectively , the @xmath9 and @xmath10axis of the history plots and the @xmath9 and @xmath10axis of the profile plots . selecting @xmath0 in one of the * axis scale *",
    "menu rescales the axis by a factor of @xmath13 .",
    "for example , if the @xmath14-axis represents the age in years , selecting ` cx=6 ` changes the units to myr . * the string - valued variables ` funcxh ` , ` funcyh ` , ` funcxp ` , and ` funcyp ` define the operation to be performed on the data represented by , respectively , ` xh ` , ` yh ` , ` xp ` and ` yp ` .",
    "their possible value is selected by popup menu type controls .",
    "the expression corresponding to the string is specified in the list ` dataoperations ` , in the section ` ( *  operations on the data * ) ` .",
    "* the real - valued variables ` offsetxh ` , ` offsetyh ` , ` offsetxp ` , and ` offsetyp ` define new zeros for the axes .",

    "<S> + _ classification : _ 1.7 stars and stellar systems , 14 graphics + _ nature of problem : _ + find a way to quickly and thoroughly analyze the output of a mesa run , including all the profiles , and have an efficient method to produce graphical representations of the data . </S>",
    "<S> + _ solution method : _ + we created two scripts ( to be run consecutively ) . </S>",
    "<S> the first one downloads all the data from a mesa run and organizes the profiles in order of age . </S>",
    "<S> all the files are saved as tables or arrays of tables which can then be accessed very quickly by mathematica . </S>",
    "<S> the second script uses the ` manipulate ` function to create a graphical interface which allows the user to choose what to plot from a set of menus and buttons . </S>",
    "<S> the information shown is updated in real time . </S>",
    "<S> the user can access very quickly all the data from the run under examination and visualize it with plots and tables . </S>",
    "<S> + _ unusual features : _ </S>",
    "<S> + moving the slides in certain regions may cause an error message . </S>",
    "<S> this happens when mathematica is asked to read nonexistent data . </S>",
    "<S> the error message , however , disappears when the slides are moved back . this issue does not preclude the good functioning of the interface . </S>",
    "<S> + _ additional comments : _ + the program uses the dynamical capabilities of mathematica . </S>",
    "<S> when the program is opened , mathematica prompts the user to `` enable dynamics '' . </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to accept before proceeding . + _ running time : _ + depends on the size of the data downloaded , on where the data are stored ( hard - drive or web ) , and on the speed of the computer or network connection . </S>",
    "<S> in general , downloading the data may take from a minute to several minutes . </S>",
    "<S> loading directly from the web is slower . </S>",
    "<S> for example , downloading a 200 mb data folder ( a total of 102 files ) with a dual - core intel laptop , p8700 , 2 gb of ram , at 2.53 ghz took about a minute from the hard - drive and about 23 minutes from the web ( with a basic home wireless connection ) . </S>"
