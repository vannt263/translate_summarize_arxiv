    "<S> the identity of the quark - squark - gluino yukawa coupling with the corresponding quark - quark - gluon qcd coupling in supersymmetric theories can be examined experimentally at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . extending earlier investigations of like - sign di - lepton final states , we include jets in the analysis of the minimal supersymmetric standard model , adding squark - gluino and gluino - pair production to squark - pair production . </S>",
    "<S> moreover we expand the method towards model - independent analyses which cover more general scenarios . in all cases </S>",
