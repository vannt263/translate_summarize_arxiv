    "the standard cdm model overproduces structure in the universe on small and intermediate length scales ( up to 1030 mpc ) when normalized to the large - scale fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation measured by cobe @xcite .",
    "the mixed dark matter model@xcite has been one of the most successful modifications of standard cdm .",
    "when normalized to the cobe data it can reproduce the right amount of structure in the linear regime@xcite , and fit the observations on galaxy scales@xcite . for many people",
    "mdm models are unattractive in that they involve two different types of dark matter particles , the neutrino with an ev mass and some other cdm particle .",
    "it was shown by madsen @xcite that if a heavy fermion ( perhaps a neutrino ) decays into a fermion and a boson in the early universe , then a large fraction of the bosons can be formed in a bose condensate ( cdm ) while the rest of the bosons are thermal ( hdm ) .",
    "kaiser , malaney & starkman@xcite subsequently demonstrated that one indeed gets a hot as well as a very cold component , though not actually a condensate .",
    "they dubbed the formation process `` neutrino lasing '' .",
    "this could be a physical explanation for mdm models and only one dark matter particle is needed , a boson with a mass of a few ev .    motivated by the ideas outlined above , this paper studies mdm models with ev mass bosons rather than neutrinos as hot dark matter .",
    "first we discuss the fundamental differences between bosons and fermions in the context of structure formation ( for pure hdm this was originally studied in@xcite ) .",
    "then we describe the method used to compute the linear power spectrum , and show our results compared to the observed linear power spectrum .",
    "finally we draw our conclusions based on how well a given model fits the observed amount of structure today , also including some comments on damped lyman-@xmath3 systems ( dlas ) to constrain the models on small ( galactic ) scales .",
    "we study variants of the model where the bosons are in kinetic equilibrium , and also comment on the consequences of relaxing this assumption .",
    "the models give structure formation results that are virtually identical to neutrino mdm for fixed hdm fraction if the boson , @xmath0 , is not its own antiparticle , whereas models with @xmath2 tend to overproduce small - scale structure ( assuming the temperature of @xmath0 equal to the neutrino temperature ) .",
    "for the preferred mixing ratio calculated from the decay scenario , the small - scale power is inconsistent with observations .",
    "the momentum distribution function for ultrarelativistic particles in kinetic equilibrium is given by : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the temperature and @xmath6 is the chemical potential of the species .",
    "the @xmath7 corresponds to a fermi - dirac distribution and @xmath8 to a bose - einstein distribution .",
    "the consequences of a non - zero chemical potential for neutrino mdm models were discussed in @xcite .",
    "if the density of relativistic particles is increased ( roughly by a factor of 2 ) then mdm and also cdm models give a much better fit to the observed linear power spectrum .",
    "a non - zero chemical potential is a simple way to accomplish that .",
    "here we assume the chemical potential to be zero .",
    "in the case of bosons this allows for the existence of a bose condensate if the bosons are formed with a temperature below a critical temperature @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the number density of bosons@xcite .",
    "the hot bosons are assumed to be thermally distributed with a number density calculated from eq .",
    "( [ ferbos ] ) with a temperature @xmath11 . as shown in @xcite the hot component in decay models is not thermal , but peaked in momentum space .",
    "however , for mdm models the important quantities ( for a fixed hdm mass fraction , @xmath12 ) are the mean momentum of the hot component and the particle mass rather than the detailed distribution , so use of eq .",
    "( [ ferbos ] ) is a fairly good approximation .",
    "we shall return to this question later .    given a certain mass fraction of hdm the mass of the hdm particle",
    "is fixed . in standard mdm models one of the three neutrino species",
    "is assumed to have a mass given by @xmath13 i.e.  @xmath14ev for a hubble parameter of @xmath15 , a neutrino mass fraction @xmath16 , and a neutrino temperature @xmath17 , where the cobe measured temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is @xmath18k @xcite . for @xmath19",
    "the mass of the boson will be a factor of 1.5 ( or 0.75 ) times the mass of a neutrino for the same hot mass fraction @xmath20 depending on whether or not @xmath2 , since in general @xmath21 where @xmath22 ( 2 ) for @xmath2 ( @xmath23 ) . in most of the paper",
    "we assume @xmath19 , corresponding to a particle in thermal equilibrium decoupling between the qcd phase transition at @xmath24mev and electron - positron annihilation at @xmath25mev , but we shall comment on other possibilities later .",
    "notice that the boson mass is determined by the thermal ( hot ) component alone .",
    "if bosons exist also in a cold ( condensate ) component there is an extra contribution to the number density of bosons given by @xmath26 .    in order to be consistent with the constraints from big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) we assume only 2 massless neutrino species and one boson species ( low mass , thus ultra - relativistic at bbn ) .",
    "the third neutrino species is assumed to have decayed away before bbn .",
    "the effective number of neutrino families at the epoch of bbn is then ( for @xmath19 ) @xmath27 ( 3.14 ) if @xmath2 @xmath28 , giving nucleosynthesis predictions within the observationally allowed range@xcite .",
    "we shall comment later on the effects of having an extra massless neutrino flavor .",
    "the amount of power in the density perturbation spectrum erased by free streaming of hot particles depends on the _ rms _ velocity of the massive bosons through the jeans wavenumber given by : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the scale factor and @xmath31 is the critical density ( we assume @xmath32 throughout this paper ) .",
    "all the power of the hot dark matter with a wavenumber greater than the jeans wavenumber at @xmath33 ( the time when the universe shifts from being dominated by radiation to matter domination ) will have free streamed away .",
    "the jeans wavenumber grows proportional to @xmath34 ( the velocity decreases as @xmath35 and the density goes as @xmath36 as the universe expands ) .",
    "only when the jeans wavenumber has become larger than the wavenumber of a given hdm density perturbation , that perturbation can begin to grow again .",
    "the growth rate of the cold component is suppressed because of the more homogeneous hot component .",
    "the shape of the power spectrum is determined by the jeans wavenumber at @xmath33 and the fraction of hdm , @xmath12 .",
    "the jeans wavenumber determines where the mdm spectrum breaks away from cdm , and @xmath12 determines the bending of the power spectrum .",
    "the _ rms _ velocity decisive for @xmath37 can be calculated from eq .",
    "( [ ferbos ] ) .",
    "free streaming is most severe when particles are relativistic and @xmath38 .",
    "for typical hdm particle masses particles become nonrelativistic just before or around @xmath33 , after which the velocity decreases and free streaming becomes less important .",
    "the main differences between having a boson hdm particle or a neutrino ( fermion ) are in the masses of the hdm particle , and in the different velocity distributions .",
    "the nonrelativistic _",
    "rms _ velocity depends on the mass of the particle , @xmath39 , and also on the phase - space distribution .",
    "the two differences happen to cancel out each other in the boson mdm models with @xmath1 .",
    "the mass @xmath40 is a factor 0.75 lower than in the neutrino mdm model , but the more low momentum states of bosons relative to neutrinos compensates this , and makes the two power spectra look very much the same , c.f .",
    "fig .  1 .",
    "in order to calculate the linear power spectrum it is necessary to integrate the linearized equations of general relativity and the boltzmann equation for the hdm particles .",
    "we use the program package of bertschinger , cosmics @xcite , which can integrate the linearized equations in both the synchronous and conformal newtonian gauge .",
    "we have modified the fortran program linger - syn.f ( synchronous gauge ) changing the phase space distribution function and making some other appropriate changes , so that we could calculate the linear power spectrum using bosons as hot dark matter . as initial conditions we have assumed adiabatic density perturbations with an initial power spectrum of harrison - zeldovich type , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , as predicted by most theories of inflation .",
    "in all the mdm models calculated we have assumed @xmath32 and in most models a hubble parameter of @xmath15 .",
    "each power spectrum was calculated with @xmath43 wavenumbers ranging from @xmath44 mpc@xmath45 to @xmath46 mpc@xmath45 , and then expanded to 201 points using the program grafic.f @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum was normalized using the cobe measured value of the microwave background anisotropy of @xmath47k @xcite .",
    "the temperature of the microwave background radiation is taken to be @xmath18k today @xcite .",
    "we have throughout assumed 5% baryons , @xmath48 .    when the calculated linear power spectrum is to be compared with the observations of large scale structure in the universe we have chosen to compare with the reconstructed linear power spectrum given by peacock and dodds @xcite .",
    "they have combined several surveys of different types of galaxies and clusters , and then corrected for redshift distortions and non - linear effects .",
    "while this reconstruction is somewhat model dependent@xcite , and it would be better to compare the actual data to simulations in the non - linear regime , it is expected to give a reasonable discrimination between models .",
    "it is important to bear in mind , though , that the error bars in ref .",
    "@xcite almost certainly are too small because the averaging procedure used underestimates the systematic errors that may result from the correction for bias between the different samples .",
    "if , for example , the iras galaxies are biased by a factor @xmath49 less than one relative to the dark matter that would raise the power spectrum and give a better fit to the calculated curves in the figures below . from ref .",
    "@xcite the bias can be as low as @xmath50 which would raise the data points by a factor @xmath51 .",
    "corrections for non - linear evolution are particularly important for large @xmath52 , and could lead to systematic errors for the last few data points shown in our figures , but these errors are probably minor ( less than a factor of 2 ) , as the region shown is only mildly non - linear .    in spite of all the reservations , we will use the data points from peacock and dodds@xcite to guide the eye .",
    "the main conclusions about the quality of our models can be made by comparing the boson mdm power spectra with the standard mdm power spectrum which is known to make a good fit for more detailed comparisons with observations@xcite .    in order to compare directly with the data points of peacock and dodds we follow their notation and calculate the dimensionless power spectrum , @xmath53 which we henceforth will refer to as the power spectrum .",
    "@xmath54 can be described as the contribution to the fractional density variance per logarithmic interval in @xmath52 .        in fig .  1 we have shown the power spectra of three different mdm models .",
    "the mass fraction of hot dark matter varies with four values @xmath55 , from the top curve to the bottom .",
    "the standard mdm models with one massive neutrino species and two massless are plotted as the dash - dotted curves .",
    "this should be directly compared to the mdm models with one massive boson @xmath28 and two massless neutrino species , the solid curves .",
    "only a very small difference between the power spectra of the two models is evident .",
    "this is due to the cancellation effect mentioned earlier .",
    "the less massive bosons ( a factor of 0.75 relative to the neutrino mass for @xmath1 ) lead to a higher value of the _ rms _ velocity giving more free streaming .",
    "but this is compensated by the difference in the phase - space distribution function , with more bosons found in the low momentum states relative to neutrinos giving less free streaming .    the dashed curves in fig .  1 are the corresponding boson mdm models with @xmath56 .",
    "now ( due to the higher boson mass ) the jeans wavenumber at @xmath33 is almost a factor of two larger than for neutrino mdm or boson mdm with @xmath1 .",
    "this means that the mdm power spectrum breaks away from the standard cdm , dotted curve , at a wavenumber a factor of two larger , resulting in a somewhat worse fit to the data points of large scale structure .",
    "notice that the dashed curves bend in the same way as the other power spectra , because the mass fraction of hdm takes the same four values for all mdm models in this figure ( the growth rate of the cdm component is reduced by the same amount ) .",
    "when comparing with the observed linear power spectrum , it is clear that the standard cdm model when normalized to the cobe data makes a very poor fit .",
    "the mdm models with @xmath56 break away from cdm a bit too late , that is at too large wavenumbers , giving a somewhat poor fit , but not excluded in case of a lower normalization on cobe - scales , for example due to gravity wave contributions to the large scale anisotropy .",
    "the standard mdm models are seen to fit the data points pretty well , apart from a constant factor which can be accommodated by lowering the normalization or by introducing a bias parameter .",
    "the cobe normalization of the power spectrum depends on the quadrupole @xmath57 squared , so within the errors the curves can be lowered by a factor of @xmath58 . and as discussed above a bias of @xmath50 would raise the data points by a factor @xmath59 . rather than tuning these parameters to get better fits in our figures , we define a model as being in reasonable agreement with observations if it has a power spectrum similar to that of the well - tested standard mdm model @xcite .",
    "the favored value of the hot fraction is @xmath600.25 .",
    "the same is true for mdm models with a massive boson @xmath28 and two massless neutrino species .      the discussion above assumed thermal bosons with a temperature equal to that of neutrinos in the standard model .",
    "clearly , relaxing this assumption changes the power spectra . for a fixed @xmath62 a decrease in @xmath11 ( for example due to boson decoupling prior to the qcd phase transition ) requires a more massive boson , so that the power spectra will follow standard cdm over a wider range of wave numbers before breaking away .",
    "this clearly makes the models less attractive compared to observations . on the other hand",
    "a hotter boson component could be more attractive , since it would be less massive and free stream more efficiently .",
    "such a situation would be hard to obtain for a primordial , thermal boson ( it could come about only if decoupling took place after electron - positron annihilation , which would increase its abundance during bbn , and also require probably unrealistically strong interactions ) . something resembling this could , however , be an outcome of the decay scenario@xcite .",
    "the physically interesting models which allow mdm with only one dark matter particle , a massive boson , tend to predict a high fraction of hot dark matter in the universe@xcite .",
    "when the cold component of bosons formed during stimulated decay of e.g.  a heavy neutrino , only half of the heavy neutrinos decay in this way , the rest of them decay into the hot bosons ( and fermions ) .",
    "the resulting fraction of cold bosons is only 35% in the case of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we have shown the power spectrum of such an mdm model with @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath48 as the lower solid curve in fig .  2 .",
    "the main problem with mdm models having 60% hot dark matter is that the power spectrum bends too much at small scales ( high values of @xmath52 ) .",
    "the linear power spectrum of this mdm model has most power on scales of @xmath65mpc@xmath45 and less power on smaller scales , which would make it inconsistent with hierarchical structure formation . in fig .",
    "2 is also shown the boson mdm model with a hot fraction of @xmath66 the top solid curve .",
    "this model fits the large scale structure data points as well as any standard mdm model , but it assumes twice as many bosons in a bose condensate as predicted by neutrino lasing .",
    "so far we have assumed a boson mass given by the thermal distribution , eq .",
    "( [ thermal ] ) . as mentioned earlier",
    ", neutrino lasing in fact does not lead to a thermal component , so in this case we should instead calculate the mass from the actual number density , which corresponds to that of the fermion decaying into the boson plus the small number density of primordial thermal bosons .",
    "the mass of the boson would then be significantly higher because it would roughly correspond to substitute @xmath67 in eq.(2 ) with @xmath68 . with this high value of the boson mass , the jeans wavenumber would increase considerably and",
    "the power spectrum would break away from standard cdm too late .",
    "this could , however , be compensated by having a higher temperature ( or , for a non - thermal distribution , mean momentum ) . as discussed in @xcite several variations of the decay models",
    "could perhaps allow such a possibility .",
    "most of the discussion above was based on the linear or weakly nonlinear evolution of the power spectrum , i.e.  on the large scale structure . in order to constrain the mdm models on galactic scales ( @xmath69mpc ) where nonlinear effects are most important",
    ", one recently discussed method is comparing with the observed number density of damped lyman-@xmath3 systems ( dlas ) .",
    "mdm models form structure late , that is at small redshifts compared to standard cdm , which makes it difficult to form enough structure at high redshifts to account for the dlas@xcite .",
    "the dlas give constraints on the mass fraction of collapsed baryons @xmath70 at high redshifts . from the observations which are quite uncertain at high redshifts , the mass fraction of collapsed baryons at @xmath71 is determined to be @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "this value may be too high ; using the observed dlas from the apm qso survey storrie - lombardi _ et al .",
    "_ find a value of roughly @xmath73@xcite    we calculate @xmath70 using the press - schecter approximation @xcite following the method outlined in @xcite .",
    "@xmath74    where erfc is the complementary error function , @xmath75 from normalizing the press - schecter approximation to numerical simulations @xcite , and @xmath76 is computed for a mass of @xmath77 solar masses corresponding to @xmath78mpc using gaussian smoothing    @xmath79    where the window function is a gaussian , @xmath80 and the power spectrum has to be calculated out to greater wavenumbers @xmath81mpc@xmath45 and at a redshift of @xmath82 .    for the mdm model with @xmath1",
    "having only 20% hdm and 75% cdm we calculate a value of @xmath83 ( the corresponding neutrino mdm model leads to a virtually identical result , @xmath84 , whereas boson mdm with @xmath2 gives @xmath85 ) , which should be enough to account for the observed amount . with 25% hdm and 70% cdm",
    "the number is @xmath86 ( @xmath87 for neutrino - mdm , and @xmath88 for boson mdm with @xmath2 ) , while having 30% hot and 65% cold dark matter bosons gives @xmath89 ( @xmath90 , @xmath91 ) .",
    "these numbers indicate that only mdm models with @xmath92 can be used , a conclusion that is independent of whether the hdm is neutrinos or bosons with @xmath1 ( for @xmath19 ) .",
    "boson mdm with @xmath2 is consistent with dlas - constraints for slightly higher @xmath12 , but at the cost of overproducing structure at somewhat larger length scales .",
    "finally we find for the mdm model with the predicted ratio of hdm and cdm from neutrino lasing , 60% hot 35% cold , a very low value of @xmath93 .",
    "though the press - schecter formalism relies on hierarchical structure formation , which is not the case when @xmath94 , it demonstrates the impossibility of forming enough small - scale structure for these parameters .      to show the effect on the power spectrum of having a different value of the hubble parameter",
    ", we have for the boson mdm model with 30% hot and 65% cold dark matter and @xmath2 calculated the power spectrum for five different values of @xmath95 ranging from @xmath96 to @xmath97 in steps of @xmath98 . in all models",
    "@xmath32 , so the age of the universe is given as @xmath99gyr .",
    "recent observational results have indicated a high value for @xmath95 , @xmath100@xcite which would lead to a very low age of the universe . from fig .",
    "3 we see that structure formation models work best for low values of @xmath95 .",
    "the effect of having @xmath101 instead of @xmath102 is quite big .    in the mdm models with one massive boson species we have assumed that one of the neutrino species had decayed away before bbn leaving only two massless neutrino species .",
    "when we assume @xmath2 the constraints from bbn@xcite might allow for three massless neutrino species and the boson , the effective numbers of neutrino families would be @xmath103 . in fig .",
    "4 we have plotted the boson mdm model with 30% hot 65% cold dark matter and @xmath2 for both two and three massless neutrino species . the effect on the power spectrum is seen to be small .",
    "the power is smaller with more neutrinos because increasing the amount of radiation delays the epoch of matter domination and suppresses the growth of structure .",
    "we have demonstrated that mdm models with a low mass thermal boson instead of a neutrino would make an equally good fit to the observed linear power spectrum when @xmath1 .",
    "the mdm models with @xmath2 tend to overproduce structure on small scales but not by much , and can be made to fit the data points in @xcite by choosing a lower value of normalization .",
    "the errors on the observed quadrupole moment allows us to lower the curves by a factor @xmath58 .",
    "it is also possible that some of the observed cobe quadrupole moment might be due to gravitational radiation instead of just the pure sachs - wolfe effect . with both a bias factor and a low normalization",
    "it is possible to make the mdm models with @xmath2 fit the observed linear power spectrum , without having to introduce gravity waves .",
    "note that an analysis of the 2-year cobe data tend to give a higher value of the quadrupole moment , @xmath104k @xcite , in which case we would need some gravity waves .",
    "soon the analysis of the 4-year data will be announced and the issue of normalization hopefully settled .    the boson mdm model predicted by lasing with 60% hot and 35% cold dark matter in the form of bosons",
    "is shown to be ruled out by its inability to account for the observed amount of small - scale structure , but other variants of the decay scenario could be consistent with observations . a more detailed calculation ( using the actual distribution functions ) would be necessary in order to present the `` real '' power spectrum of neutrino lasing mdm models .",
    "we believe that assuming a thermal boson plus a bose condensate is a good first order approximation .",
    "we would like to thank the theoretical astrophysics center under the danish national research foundation for its financial support .",
