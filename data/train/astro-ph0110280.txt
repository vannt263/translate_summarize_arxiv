    "observations of neutral hydrogen absorption troughs ( the gunn - peterson effect ) seem to indicate that intergalactic hydrogen was reionized and hence that the ionizing uv `` turned on '' between @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( becker et al .",
    "2001 , djgorvski et al .",
    "a more direct probe of galaxy formation is to determine the number counts and redshift evolution of nascent galaxies .",
    "the large area lyman alpha ( lala ) survey ( rhoads et al . 2000 ) has been designed and executed to detect large enough samples of high - redshift emitters to be statistically useful .",
    "strong lyman-@xmath0  emission , shown by large equivalent widths in the line , indicates that these are young galaxies ( malhotra et al .",
    "2001 ) . since large scale structure can influence galaxy counts even at high redshifts ( steidel et al .",
    "1998 , adelberger et al . 1998 ) , large area surveys are vital to study redshift evolution .",
    "narrow - band surveys maximize sensitivity and solid angle , and allow us to push for higher redshift objects by designing narrow - bands to avoid bright sky lines .",
    "lyman-@xmath0  galaxies also offer a particularly direct and robust test of the reionization epoch ( haiman & spaans 1999 ) . before reionization , lyman-@xmath0  emitting galaxies of normal luminosity are effectively hidden from view by the scattering `` fog '' of the neutral igm ( miralda - escud 1998 ; rybicki & loeb 1999 ) .",
    "thus , the reionization redshift should be marked by a sharp decrease in the number counts of faint lyman-@xmath0  emitters .",
    "this test is independent of the gunn - peterson trough observations in quasar spectra .",
    "moreover , the gunn - peterson test has difficulty distinguishing opaque but modest optical depths @xmath10 from the much larger obscuration @xmath11 expected in a neutral igm .",
    "lyman-@xmath0  galaxy counts can resolve this ambiguity .",
    "the red wing of the lyman-@xmath0  line from a star forming galaxy sees only the red damping wing of intergalactic lyman-@xmath0  absorption , and lyman-@xmath0  galaxies therefore remain detectable up to line - center optical depths @xmath12 .    in this paper",
    "we report on a population of candidate @xmath9",
    "lyman-@xmath0  emitters discovered in the second phase of lala survey and compare their properties to the z=4.5 sample ( rhoads et al .",
    "section  [ obs ] describes our observations and data reduction . in section 3",
    "we present the candidates and their properties .",
    "section 4 explores the implications of these discoveries for the epoch of galaxy formation .",
    "the large area lyman alpha survey began in spring 1998 as a narrowband search for @xmath13 lyman-@xmath0  emitting galaxies .",
    "the project was designed to exploit the high survey efficiency offered by the 36 field of the new ccd mosaic camera at the kitt peak national observatory 4 m mayall telescope .",
    "the core of the lala survey is @xmath14 in two fields centered at 14:25:57 + 35:32 ( 2000.0 ) ( the botes field ) and 02:05:20 -04:55 ( 2000.0 ) ( the cetus field ) .    in april 2000",
    ", we extended the botes field survey to @xmath15 using custom - built narrowband filters having central wavelengths @xmath16 , full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) transmission @xmath17 , and peak throughput @xmath18 .",
    "the wavelengths were chosen to fall in a gap in the night sky emission line spectrum , thus minimizing sky noise .",
    "the filter bandpass deteriorated below these specifications outside a central circle of @xmath19 diameter .",
    "this resulted in substantially degraded throughput in the outer parts of our images , which we therefore excluded from our analysis .",
    "the @xmath15 observing run was four nights , beginning with the night of 1011 april 2000 ( i.e. , 2000 april 11 ut ) .",
    "the weather was generally clear .",
    "photometric stability was checked by measuring the fluxes of selected stars on all science exposures .",
    "this showed @xmath20 variation in throughput for the entire run , mostly due to airmass - dependent extinction .",
    "we obtained 9.85 hours of data in 40 exposures through the 815 nm filter , and 9 hours in 36 exposures through the 823 nm filter .",
    "exposures were spatially dithered with characteristic ( rms ) offsets of @xmath21 .",
    "seeing ranged from @xmath22 to @xmath23 ( median @xmath24 ) in the 815 nm filter , and @xmath25 to @xmath26 ( median @xmath27 ) in the 823 nm filter .",
    "median narrowband sky brightnesses were @xmath28 at 815 nm and @xmath29 at 823 nm .",
    "we also obtained a deep ( 4 hour ) image in a sloan digital sky survey z filter during this run .",
    "data reduction was done in iraf following the methods used for the @xmath30 sources ( rhoads et al 2000 ) .",
    "the final stacks have point spread functions ( psf ) with directly measured full widths at half maximum of @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) and @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the psf wings are higher than gaussians of the same fwhm , since the images are sums of many frames with varying seeing .",
    "catalogs were generated using sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "fluxes were measured in @xmath35 ( 9 pixel ) diameter apertures , and colors were obtained using matched @xmath35 apertures in registered images .",
    "we also measured fluxes in earlier broad band images from the noao deep wide - field survey ( b@xmath36 , r , and i bands ) ( jannuzi & dey 1999 ) and broad and narrow band images from previous lala runs ( v band and four @xmath37  narrow bands ) .",
    "we select @xmath38 candidates using the following criteria : ( 1 ) secure detection in a narrowband filter ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "( 2 ) a strong narrowband excess ( narrow @xmath40 broad color @xmath41 magnitude , corresponding to a factor of @xmath42 in flux density ) that is securely measured ( the flux density in the narrow band should exceed that in the broad band at the @xmath43 level ) . ( 3 ) no flux at wavelengths shorter than the expected lyman break wavelength ( the object should remain undetected in b@xmath36 and v band fluxes at the @xmath44 level or below ) .",
    "the first two criteria are designed to ensure that real emission line objects are selected , while the third rejects most low redshift emission line galaxies , using the blue bands as `` veto '' filters .",
    "in total , 18 objects in the two filters ( 11 in the @xmath32 filter and 7 in the @xmath34 filter ) passed all selection criteria and are considered good @xmath38 candidates .",
    "photometric `` mini - spectra '' for these candidates are shown in figure  [ minispec ] .",
    "intergalactic hydrogen absorption is expected to attenuate the measured i band flux used for candidate selection .",
    "the formulation of madau ( 1995 ) gives correction factors of @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 for @xmath48 .",
    "we apply these corrections to the i band flux before calculating the equivalent widths of the emission lines from our broad and narrow band photometry .",
    "these corrections are comparable to the factor of 2 difference in flux density required for selection .",
    "we therefore apply another cut to our candidate lists , removing the five candidates whose observer frame equivalent widths fall below @xmath49  after the correction for hydrogen absorption .",
    "we expect these objects to be either high redshift _ or _",
    "strong emission line objects , but they need not be both . because intergalactic hydrogen absorption can also remove the bluest @xmath50 of the lyman-@xmath0  line flux , our equivalent width corrections and the resulting candidate list cut are both quite conservative .",
    "we now turn to the implications of our survey for galaxy formation and cosmology .",
    "first , let us compare the statistics of @xmath9 sources to the @xmath5 lyman-@xmath0  emitters .",
    "there are 13 sources at @xmath9 and 156 at @xmath5 .",
    "however , a minority of our @xmath5 are bright enough to be detectable at @xmath9 .    using a @xmath51 , @xmath52 cosmology and accounting for the difference in solid angle between the two redshifts . ] , the comoving survey volume at @xmath9 is @xmath53 that at @xmath5 ( @xmath54 in each filter ) .",
    "the @xmath55 flux thresholds used to identify candidates at @xmath9 were @xmath56 at @xmath32 and @xmath57 at @xmath34 .",
    "the distance - corrected equivalent thresholds at @xmath5 will be larger by a factor of @xmath58 for the above cosmology .",
    "there are then @xmath59 @xmath13 candidates that could be detected in our @xmath32 data , and @xmath60 that could be detected in our @xmath34 data .",
    "thus , based on the @xmath5 survey and a no - evolution assumption , we would expect to find @xmath61 sources in the @xmath32 filter , and @xmath62 in the @xmath34 filter .",
    "we actually identify @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively .",
    "this excess in the observed @xmath9 candidate counts is moderately significant ( at the 99% level assuming poisson source counts ) .",
    "the important difference is in the @xmath32 counts ; the @xmath34 filter candidate counts are consistent with the nave scaling from @xmath5 .",
    "we now examine several possible explanations for this effect .    first , lyman-@xmath0  emitters at @xmath9 may be more numerous and/or more luminous than those at @xmath5 .",
    "such effects are reasonable : the lyman-@xmath0  line is resonantly scattered and can be strongly quenched by dust absorption . since dust is formed from stellar nucleosynthesis products , we expect galaxies at earlier epochs to be ( on average ) less chemically evolved and less dusty .",
    "more luminous lyman-@xmath0  lines may be a natural byproduct , provided that the effects of chemical evolution are not overwhelmed by the trend of decreasing halo mass at higher redshift .",
    "indeed , under the lyman-@xmath0  emitter population models of haiman & spaans ( 1999 ) , evolutionary effects are so strong that the total surface density per unit redshift above a fixed line flux @xmath65 is approximately independent of redshift for @xmath66 .",
    "our results show a factor @xmath67 decrease in the surface density of lyman-@xmath0  emitter candidates from @xmath30 to @xmath15 ( in contrast to an expected factor @xmath68 from the haiman & spaans models ) .",
    "the lala data is thus more nearly consistent with a no - evolution model than with the baseline model from haiman & spaans ( 1999 ) .",
    "in addition , large scale structure can significantly affect the number counts of objects in single fields .",
    "our @xmath69 field makes lala results comparatively robust to such effects , but a factor of @xmath45 difference in source density may still be consistent with cosmic variance .",
    "finally , our candidate sample will contain some residual contamination by foreground objects .",
    "the numbers of such objects should be comparatively small , given the high - redshift consistency checks described in sections  [ obs ] and  [ results ] .",
    "foreground emission line galaxies are the most serious concern .",
    "our primary defense against such galaxies is the requirement that a good candidate be undetected in deep broadband images with @xmath70 .",
    "this imposes an approximate minimum observer frame equivalent width for any interloper , which we estimate using the minimum narrow band flux @xmath71 and maximum broad band flux @xmath72 .",
    "( here @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the photometric errors in flux density units for the narrow and broad blue filters . )",
    "the corresponding equivalent width is then @xmath75 \\times \\delta\\lambda_n \\sim 1100$] , where we assume that the line lies outside the broad band filter .",
    "the redshifts of likely foreground objects are relatively low ( @xmath76 ) , and the corresponding emission frame equivalent widths therefore remain large ( @xmath77 ) . while compact , narrow emission line galaxies can attain these equivalent widths , they are very rare ( e.g. , hogg et al 1998 ) .",
    "cool stars can also enter narrowband emission line samples because molecular absorption in their atmospheres produces spectral features with widths of a few @xmath78 and amplitudes several tens of percent .",
    "however , in the absence of true emission lines , cool stars will show detectable continuum at @xmath79 of the narrowband flux density , which is also expected to be quite red , so that our sdss z filter should clearly show such stars .",
    "most of our candidates having strong z detections were discarded from our sample by the last cut applied ( see section  [ results ] ) .",
    "only two of the 13 remaining sources , lala5 1 - 08 and lala5 1 - 10 , have `` minispectra '' that plausibly resemble cool stars .",
    "because our narrow and broad band filters were obtained at different times , variable objects may also enter the sample at a low level .",
    "the relevant objects would have to have @xmath80 during the narrow band observations ( 2000 april 1114 ut ) , and @xmath81 during the i band observation ( 1999 march 27 ut ) .",
    "( in fact , our requirement on the blue flux imposes additional limits . )",
    "the largest known source of such variable objects would be high redshift supernovae .",
    "however , these would show roughly equal brightness in both @xmath9 narrow bands and the sdss z image , since their characteristic variability timescale is several days .",
    "again , only lala5 1 - 08 and lala5 1 - 10 are consistent with this expectation .",
    "sources with faster variability , such as orphan grb afterglows ( rhoads 1997 ) , are very rare and we would expect @xmath82 such source in our sample ( e.g. , dalal et al 2001 ) .",
    "we compared the equivalent width distribution of the @xmath30 and @xmath83 samples . very low and high",
    "equivalent width objects are missing in z=5.7 sample compared to z=4.5 sample . using a kolmogorov - smirnov test",
    "we find a 20% chance that the two samples are drawn from the same parent distribution .",
    "this test is only marginally conclusive , mostly because of the small number of @xmath15 objects .",
    "the consistency of the present samples is nonetheless further evidence that we are seeing the same class of object at @xmath15 as at @xmath30 .    in summary , we have a sample of @xmath84 @xmath9 lyman-@xmath0emitting galaxy candidates .",
    "only two of these have the apparent spectral energy distributions expected of stars or variable objects .",
    "the upper limits on blue flux rule out all but the highest equivalent width foreground sources , which are too rare to account for the entire sample .",
    "the equivalent width distributions are consistent at @xmath9 and @xmath85 .",
    "thus , the simplest explanation of the data is that we are really seeing @xmath9 lyman-@xmath0  emitters .",
    "we now draw one very robust and important conclusion from our sample .",
    "the epoch of reionization is a major landmark in the evolution of the universe .",
    "recently , the gunn - peterson trough has been reported in spectra of two high redshift quasars : sdsspj 103027.10 + 052455.0 at @xmath86 ( becker et al 2001 ) , and sdss 1044 - 0125 at @xmath87 ( djorgovski et al 2001 ) .",
    "these authors have interpreted their spectra as evidence that reionization was incomplete at these redshifts .",
    "if the universe was neutral at redshift @xmath88 , lyman-@xmath0  photons from sources at higher redshift would be resonantly scattered in the neutral intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "this effectively erases the lyman-@xmath0line from view for a survey like lala .",
    "thus , our @xmath9 sample implies that the reionization redshift lies at @xmath89 along the line of sight to the lala botes field .",
    "this argument relies merely on the _ presence _ of low - luminosity lyman-@xmath0  sources , and is independent of their exact number .",
    "two possible loopholes exist , but both are readily closed .",
    "first , in the absence of dust , the lyman-@xmath0  photons eventually scatter far enough into the line wing to propagate freely . however , this process spreads the line emission greatly in both area and frequency , resulting in a very large `` photosphere '' and a correspondingly low surface brightness ( loeb & rybicki 1999 ) .",
    "all of the sources reported in this paper are compact in the narrow band image ( i.e. , essentially unresolved at our resolution limit of @xmath90 ) and so morphologically inconsistent with a source embedded in a neutral igm .",
    "second , a source with a sufficient ionizing flux will generate its own stromgren sphere in the igm .",
    "if this sphere is large enough , lyman-@xmath0  photons will redshift by @xmath91 before reaching the surrounding neutral gas , and will thus avoid resonant scattering .",
    "however , this effect requires sources either more luminous or older than typical lala objects .",
    "we assume that a fraction @xmath92 of ionizing photons escape a galaxy to ionize its stromgren sphere , and that @xmath93 of the remainder result in lyman-@xmath0  photons , and that @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath52 , and @xmath96 .",
    "we then require an ionized bubble radius @xmath97 , which gives a gunn - peterson effect optical depth @xmath98 at emitted line center ( see also loeb & rybicki 1999 ) . ignoring recombinations , @xmath99 requires a source with @xmath100 , where @xmath101 and the source is @xmath102 years old .",
    "lala @xmath9 sources have @xmath103 .",
    "their median rest frame equivalent width of @xmath104   requires @xmath105 for any reasonable initial mass function ( i.e. , salpeter ) , upper mass cutoff @xmath106 , metallicity @xmath107 , and @xmath108 gives @xmath109 .",
    "substantially larger ew requires @xmath110 . ] , unless @xmath111 ( malhotra et al 2001 ; kudritzki et al 1999 ) .",
    "the age of the universe at @xmath15 requires @xmath112 .",
    "thus , @xmath113 , and lyman-@xmath0  radiation from these sources would indeed suffer resonant scattering if the igm were neutral .",
    "we are thus confident that the compact , low - luminosity lyman-@xmath0  emitters we observe at @xmath38 are in a mostly ionized universe .",
    "this method offers a test for reionization independent of the spectroscopic search for gunn - peterson troughs .",
    "moreover , it is better able to distinguish line center optical depths @xmath2 ( indicating a neutral igm ) from much smaller but still essentially opaque optical depths @xmath114 ( indicating lyman-@xmath0forest absorption ) , because the lyman-@xmath0  forest will in general absorb only the blue side of the lyman-@xmath0  emission line , while a neutral igm will absorb the entire line . for an intrinsic line width of @xmath115",
    ", we would still expect to see some lyman-@xmath0  flux through an igm with a ( homogeneously mixed ) neutral fraction of @xmath116 , while the gunn - peterson trough is optically thick ( @xmath117 ) for a neutral fraction as small as @xmath118 .    to conclude , we have demonstrated that lyman-@xmath0  emitters are found at @xmath9 in densities comparable to those at @xmath5 at similar line luminosities .",
    "it follows that the reionization redshift was @xmath119 , at least along this line of sight .",
    "tentatively , it appears that the lyman-@xmath0  source density at equal luminosity rises from @xmath5 to @xmath9 .",
    "we have also obtained pilot observations in a @xmath120 narrowband filter .",
    "this redshift lies beyond the recently reported gunn - peterson effect quasars , and will ultimately allow us to bracket the reionization epoch through lyman-@xmath0  source counts .",
