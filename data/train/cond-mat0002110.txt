    "the first observation of the @xmath1 long - range order for a [ 001 ] copt film grown by mbe was made by harp _",
    "et al._@xcite in 1993 and for a [ 001 ] fept film by cebollada _",

    "et al._@xcite and by evaporation by lin and gorman,@xcite and fept films were grown by various sputtering techniques.@xcite    the magneto - crystalline anisotropy energy ( mca ) can be probed by many techniques such as torque or ferromagnetic resonance measurements .",
    "both these methods describe the mca in terms of phenomenological anisotropy constants .",
    "it has been demonstrated by weller _",
    "et al._@xcite that x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) is also a suitable technique for probing the mca , _ via _ the determination of the anisotropy of the orbital magnetic moment on a specific shell and site .",
    "the x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) using polarized radiation probes element specific magnetic properties of alloys by applying the xmcd sum rules to the experimental spectra.@xcite however for itinerant systems , in particular to low symmetry systems , the use of the sum rules is debated because they are derived from an atomic theory.@xcite lately angle - dependent xmcd experiments have been used to provide a deeper understanding for the relation between mca and the orbital magnetic moments.@xcite    the x - ray absorption for copt multi - layers has been already studied experimentally by nakajima _",

    "et al._@xcite nakajima _",
    "et al._@xcite revealed a strong enhancement of the cobalt orbital moment when pma was present , koide _",
    "et al._@xcite showed that with decreasing cobalt thickness the easy axis rotates from in - plane to out - of - plane , and regg _",
    "et al._@xcite that platinum polarization increases also with decreasing cobalt thickness .",
    "hlil _ et al._@xcite showed by x - ray absorption spectroscopy that modifications of platinum edges in different compounds are correlated to the change in the number of holes .",
    "several _ ab - initio _ calculations have already been performed to investigate the xmcd.@xcite the @xmath2- and @xmath3-edges involving electronic excitations of 2@xmath4-core electrons towards @xmath5-valence states have primarily attracted much attention due to dependence of the dichroic spectra on the exchange - splitting and the spin - orbit coupling of both initial core and final valence states . for 5@xmath5 elements dissolved in 3@xmath5 transition metals , the spin - orbit coupling of the initial 2@xmath4-core states is large and the resulting magnetic moment is small , while the opposite is true for the 3@xmath5 elements .",
    "this can lead to a pronounced dichroic spectra as seen by schtz in the case of 5@xmath5 elements dissolved in iron.@xcite    in this work we study the correlation between the quantization axis dependent xmcd and the magnetic properties of both ordered alloys fept and copt .",
    "our method is based on an all - electron relativistic and spin - polarized full - potential muffin - tin orbital method ( lmto)@xcite in conjunction with both the von barth and hedin parameterization to the local density approximation ( lsda)@xcite and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga)@xcite to the exchange correlation potential . the implementation of the calculation of the xmcd spectra has been presented in a previous work.@xcite in section 2 we present the details of the calculations , while in sections 3 and 4 we discuss our mca and the magnetic spin and orbital moments , respectively . in section 5",
    "we present our calculated xmcd as a function of the spin quantization axis , and in section 6 we discuss the interpretation of the mca using the band structure and the total density of states anisotropy .",
    "to compute the electronic properties of copt and fept we used the experimental lattice constants ( @xmath6=3.806  and @xmath7/@xmath6=0.968 for copt@xcite ; @xmath6= 3.861  and @xmath7/@xmath6=0.981 for fept@xcite ) and a unit cell containing one atom of cobalt(iron ) and one of platinum .",
    "the @xmath0 structure can be seen as a system of alternating cobalt(iron ) and platinum layers along the [ 001 ] direction .",
    "the mca and the xmcd are computed with respect to the angle @xmath8 between the [ 001 ] axis and the spin quantization axis on the ( 010 ) plane .",
    "so @xmath8=0@xmath9 corresponds to the [ 001 ] axis and @xmath8=90@xmath9 to the [ 100 ] axis .",
    "mca can be computed directly using _ ab - initio _ methods ; it is defined as the difference between the total energy for two different spin quantization axis . the spin - orbit coupling contribution to mca",
    "is implicitly included in our _ ab - initio _ calculations , and we do not take into account the many - body interactions of the spin - magnetic moments@xcite since their contribution to the mca is negligible.@xcite the number of * k * points for performing the brillouin zone ( bz ) integration depends strongly on the interplay between the contributions to the mca from the fermi surface and the remaining band structure contribution to the total energy.@xcite when the former contribution to the mca is important , a large number of * k*-points is needed to describe accurately the fermi surface .",
    "for the two studied systems we found that 6750 * k*-points in the bz are enough to converge the mca within 0.1 mev .    to perform the integrals over the bz we use a gaussian broadening method which convolutes each discrete eigenvalue with a gaussian function of width 0.1 ev .",
    "this method is known to lead to a fast and stable convergence of the spin and charge densities compared to the standard tetrahedron method . to develop the potential inside the mt spheres we calculated a basis set of lattice harmonics including functions up to @xmath10 , while for the fft we used a real space grid of 16@xmath1116@xmath1120 .",
    "we used a double set of basis functions , one set to describe the valence states and one for the unoccupied states . for the valence electrons we used a basis",
    "set containing 3@xmath12 , 3@xmath13 and 2@xmath14 wave functions , and for the unoccupied states 2@xmath12 , 2@xmath13 and 2@xmath14 wave functions .",
    "copt and fept films are known to present a strong uniaxial mca , because of the high anisotropic @xmath0 inter - metallic phase .",
    "experimentally the magnetization axis is found to be along the [ 001 ] direction.@xcite in a first step we performed calculations with 250 * k*-points in the bz .",
    "this number of * k*-points is large enough to produce accurate total energy when gaussian smearing is used for the integration in the brillouin zone but not enough accurate to compute the mca . in figure  [ fig12 ]",
    "we present calculations with respect to the angle @xmath8 between the [ 001 ] axis and the spin quantization axis on the ( 010 ) plane for the copt compound within the lsda .",
    "we observe that total energy value increases with the angle @xmath8 .",
    "so the ground state corresponds to @xmath8=0@xmath9 , _",
    "i.e. _ the [ 001 ] axis .",
    "the same behavior occurs for the fept compound . because 250 * k*-points are not enough to produce an accurate value for the mca , we present in figure [ fig2 ] the convergence of the mca with the number of * k*-points for both compounds within lsda .",
    "the mca is the difference in the total energy between the in - plane axis [ 100 ] and [ 110 ] and the easy axis [ 001 ] .",
    "we have found that the total energy difference between the [ 100 ] and the [ 110 ] directions is negligible compared to the difference between the in - plane axis and the [ 001 ] axis .",
    "our values are converged up to 6750 * k*-points and are given per unit cell ( one atom of x and one of platinum ) .",
    "the mca converges to 2.2 ev for copt and 3.9 ev for fept .",
    "these behavior confirms the assumption that the system is isotropic inside the plane .",
    "the gga mca calculations converged to 1.9 mev and 4.1 mev for copt and fept , respectively .",
    "the gga results seem to be in good agreement with the lsda results .",
    "daalderop _ et al._@xcite performed calculations for mca in copt and fept by means of an lmto method in the atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) within lsda@xcite using the force theorem.@xcite the easy magnetization axis found by this latter calculation is the [ 001 ] for both systems in agreement with our lsda and gga results .",
    "their mca value is 2 mev for copt and is 3.5 mev for fept .",
    "et al._@xcite used the same structure within a real - space green s function technique framework to find also that the magnetization is along the [ 001 ] axis . including the spin - orbit interaction for all the atoms , they found a copt mca value of 2.3 mev and a fept value of 3.4 mev .",
    "our computed value agrees also with the value of 1.5 mev for copt and 2.8 mev for fept , obtained by sakuma@xcite using lmto method in the atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) in conjunction with the force theorem.@xcite the drawback of the lmto - asa method is that it accounts only for the spherical part of the potential and ignores the interstitial region .",
    "furthermore , the force theorem does not account directly for the exchange - correlation contribution to the mca . finally , oppeneer used the augmented spherical waves method ( asw ) in the atomic sphere approximation and found a mca value of 2.8 mev for fept and 1.0 mev for copt,@xcite which are the smallest among all the _ ab - initio _ calculations .",
    "grange _ et al._,@xcite using a torque measurement for a mbe deposited copt film on a mgo(001 ) substrate , obtained a mae of 1.0 mev .",
    "an early measurement of a monocristal of copt , by eurin and pauleve , produced a value of 1.3 mev.@xcite the large value of eurin and pauleve is due to the fact that their sample was completely ordered . for fept the first experiment of ivanov _ et al._@xcite produced an anisotropy value of 1.2 mev and showed that for a thin film the shape anisotropy would be one order of magnitude smaller compared to the mca .",
    "et al._@xcite and thiele _",
    "et al._@xcite found for mbe deposited fept films on a mgo(001 ) substrate an anisotropy value of 1.8 mev .",
    "these films were highly ordered ( more than 95% of the atoms were in the correct site ) .",
    "all experiments have been carried out at room temperature , which explain at some extend the difference between the calculated and experimental mca values ( the mca decreases with temperature@xcite ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the experimental mca for fept is much larger than that of copt in agreement with our calculations . for thick films volume shape anisotropy ( vsa )",
    "contributes also to the mae and it favors always an in - plane magnetization axis .",
    "we can estimate the vsa as @xmath15 in c.g.s",
    ". units , where @xmath16 is the mean magnetization density,@xcite and obtain a value of -0.1 mev for fept and -0.06 mev for copt .",
    "these values are one order of magnitude smaller than the mca values in agreement with the speculation of ivanov _",
    "in figure  [ fig3 ] we present the cobalt - projected partial density of states for three spin quantization axis corresponding to angles @xmath8= 0@xmath9 , 45@xmath9 and 90@xmath9 calculated with 6750 * k*-points .",
    "the 3-@xmath5 states dominate the electronic structure of cobalt .",
    "the spin - up band is practically totally occupied while the spin down band is almost half - occupied .",
    "the general form of the cobalt dos , as well as the iron dos , does not seem to change appreciably with the angle @xmath8 .",
    "the platinum projected density of states show similar behavior for both fept and copt compounds .",
    "bulk platinum is paramagnetic and the small changes in the dos come from the polarization of the 5@xmath5 electrons via hybridization with the 3@xmath5 electrons of cobalt ( iron ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the dos is calculated inside each muffin - tin and the interstitial region is not taken into account . to minimize the contribution of the interstitial region we use almost touching muffin - tin spheres .",
    "in addition , we have find that remaining region has a negligible spin polarization .",
    "the spin magnetic moments are isotropic with respect to the spin quantization axis as expected .",
    "they were calculated by attributing all the charge inside each muffin - tin sphere to the atom located in that sphere .",
    "as outlined above we have found that the interstitial contribution to the spin magnetic moment is one order of magnitude smaller than that of the platinum site . in copt",
    "we found a cobalt spin magnetic moment of 1.79 @xmath17 and a platinum moment of 0.36 @xmath17 within the lsda .",
    "the gga cobalt spin magnetic moment of 1.83 @xmath17 is slightly larger than the value within lsda .",
    "this is due to a more atomic like description of the atoms in a solid within the gga compared to the lsda .",
    "although the gga underestimates the hybridization between cobalt and platinum @xmath5 valence electrons compared to the lsda , the larger cobalt spin moment leads to a slightly larger gga platinum spin moment of 0.37 @xmath17 .",
    "our calculated values are in good agreement with the experimental values of grange _ et al . _",
    "( 1.75@xmath17 for cobalt and 0.35@xmath17 for platinum).@xcite previous experiments by van laar on a powder sample gave a value of 1.7 @xmath17 for the cobalt atom and 0.25 for the platinum atom.@xcite the spin magnetic moments have been previously calculated by solovyev _ et al._@xcite ( 1.72 for cobalt and 0.37 for platinum ) , by daalderop _ et al_@xcite ( 1.86 for cobalt ) , by sakuma@xcite ( 1.91 for cobalt and 0.38 for platinum ) , and finally by kootte _ et al._@xcite by means of a localized spherical wave method ( 1.69 for cobalt and 0.37 for platinum ) .",
    "all previous calculations are in good agreement with our full - potential results .",
    "as expected the iron spin moments are much larger than the cobalt ones .",
    "the lsda produced a value of 2.87 @xmath17 while the gga produced a slightly larger value , 2.96 @xmath17 .",
    "the hybridization between the iron 3@xmath5 states and the platinum 5@xmath5 states is less intense than in the case of copt resulting in a smaller platinum moment for fept .",
    "the lsda platinum spin moment is 0.33 @xmath17 ( compared to 0.36 @xmath17 in copt ) and the gga platinum spin moment is 0.34 @xmath17 ( compared to 0.37 @xmath17 in copt ) .",
    "the spin magnetic moments have been previously calculated by solovyev et al@xcite ( 2.77 for iron and 0.35 for platinum ) , by daalderop et al@xcite ( 2.91 for iron ) , by sakuma@xcite ( 2.93 for iron and 0.33 for platinum ) , and finally by osterloch _ et al._@xcite ( 2.92 for iron and 0.38 for platinum ) . here again all previous calculations are in good agreement with our full - potential results .",
    "all the methods produced a smaller induced spin moment for platinum atom in fept than for copt , verifying that the hybridization effect in copt is much stronger than in fept .",
    "contrary to spin moments , the orbital moments are anisotropic .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] presents the behavior of the orbital moments as a function of the angle @xmath8 between the [ 001 ] direction and the spin quantization axis within lsda for both copt and fept compounds ( the lines are guide to the eye ) .",
    "the orbital moments decrease with respect to the angle @xmath8 but the values for the [ 100 ] axis does not follow this general trend .",
    "all four lines seem to have the same behavior , but it is interesting to notice that for the copt and magnetization along the [ 100 ] axis cobalt orbital moment is smaller than the platinum one ( for the values see tables [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] ) .",
    "the cobalt moments decrease faster than platinum moments in copt . for the iron and platinum atoms in fept the two lines are practically parallel .",
    "the platinum orbital moments in fept are smaller than for the copt with a factor that varies from 73% for @xmath8=0@xmath9 to 67% for @xmath8=90@xmath9 .",
    "the ratio of iron and platinum orbital moments in fept varies from 1.56 for @xmath8=0@xmath9 down to 1.35 for for @xmath8=90@xmath9 , which is considerably smaller than the ratio of cobalt and platinum orbital moments in copt .",
    "we notice here that in our calculations we can estimate only the projection of the total orbital moment on the spin quantization axis and we have no information concerning the real value of the total magnetic moment or its direction in space .",
    "it seems that for the magnetization along the [ 100 ] direction , the direction of the orbital magnetic moment undergoes a discontinuous jump , resulting in a large projection on the spin quantization axis with respect to @xmath8 at the vicinity of 90@xmath9 .",
    "this behavior is also reproduced by the gga .    in table",
    "[ table1 ] we present the values of the orbital moments of iron and cobalt within both the lsda and gga as a function of the angle @xmath8 .",
    "the gga values seem to be smaller than the lsda ones but follow exactly the same trends .",
    "the orbital moment anisotropy is more important in the case of cobalt .",
    "the lsda cobalt orbital moment changes by 0.048 @xmath17 and the gga moment by 0.027 @xmath17 as we pass from the easy axis [ 001 ] to the hard axis [ 100 ] .",
    "the lsda iron moment changes by 0.002 @xmath17 and the gga moment is the same for the two high symmetry directions . in the case of cobalt",
    "the difference between values calculated within the two functionals , lsda and gga , becomes smaller when the angle increases and for 75@xmath9 it changes sign . in the case of iron",
    "this difference decreases only slightly with the angle but since the difference is considerably smaller than in copt ( less than 0.004 ) , we conclude that the orbital moment in the lsda and the gga are roughly the same .    in table",
    "[ table2 ] we present the values for the platinum orbital moment within both functionals .",
    "we see that the gga produces larger moments than the lsda for platinum in fept contrary to copt .",
    "the platinum moments are in general smaller than the moments of the 3@xmath5 ferromagnets , and the difference between the values calculated within lsda and gga are small .",
    "the absolute values for platinum are comparable to cobalt(iron ) orbital moments even though the spin moments on platinum are one order of magnitude smaller than for cobalt(iron ) .",
    "the large orbital moments for platinum are due to a much larger spin - orbit coupling for the @xmath5 electrons of the platinum compared to the 3@xmath5 ferromagnets .",
    "the orbital moments of fept and copt have been previously calculated by daalderop and collaborators@xcite and by solovyev and collaborators@xcite for the [ 001 ] direction using the lsda .",
    "the orbital moment of the cobalt site was found to be 0.12 @xmath17 by daalderop and 0.09 @xmath17 by solovyev .",
    "the value of daalderop is closer to our lsda value of 0.11 @xmath17 .",
    "for iron site daalderop found a value of 0.08 @xmath17 and solovyev 0.07 @xmath17 in good agreement with our lsda value .",
    "the platinum orbital moment has been calculated by solovyev .",
    "he found a value of 0.06 @xmath17 for platinum in copt and 0.044 @xmath17 for platinum in fept , close to our values , 0.06 @xmath17 and 0.05 @xmath17 , respectively .    on the other hand ,",
    "experimental data are available for copt by grange;@xcite obtained by applying the sum rules to the experimental xmcd spectra .",
    "the sum rules give the moments per hole in the @xmath5-band .",
    "to compare experiment with theory we calculated the number of @xmath5-holes by integrating the @xmath5 projected density of states inside each muffin - tin sphere .",
    "we found 2.63 @xmath5 and 2.48 @xmath5 holes for cobalt and platinum , respectively .",
    "the cobalt orbital moment varies from 0.26 @xmath17 for @xmath8=10@xmath9 down to 0.11 @xmath17 for @xmath8=60@xmath9 .",
    "the measured values are also available for two other angles : 0.24 @xmath17 for @xmath8=30@xmath9 and 0.17 @xmath17 for @xmath8=45@xmath9 .",
    "our theory reproduces qualitatively the experimental trends but underestimates the absolute values by more than 50% ( see tables [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] for all the values ) .",
    "the calculated values show a less sharp decrease with the angle than the experimental ones . for platinum",
    "the experimental data are available only for two angles 10@xmath9 and 60@xmath9 . for @xmath8=10@xmath9",
    "the orbital moment is 0.09 @xmath17 and for @xmath8=60@xmath9 it is 0.06 @xmath17 .",
    "for the platinum site the calculated values are in much better agreement than for the cobalt site but we must keep in mind that the sum rules have their origin in an atomic theory and their use for 5@xmath5 itinerant electrons like in platinum is still debated . the discrepancy between the theory and the experiment comes mainly from the approximation to the exchange and correlation . both the lsda and the gga approximations to the density functional theory",
    "are known to underestimate the orbital moment values , because the orbital moment is a property directly associated with the current in the solid and a static image is not sufficient .",
    "but until now a dft formalism like the current and spin density functional theory ( cs - dft),@xcite which can treat at the same footing the kohn - sham and the maxwell equations is too heavy to implement in a full - potential _ ab - initio method_. the other problem is that there is no form of the exchange energy of a homogeneous electronic gas in a magnetic field known and this is the main quantity entering the cs - dft formalism .",
    "brooks has also developed an _",
    "ad hoc _ correction to the hamiltonian to account for the orbital polarization but this correction originates from an atomic theory and its application to itinerant systems is not satisfactory.@xcite",
    "xmcd spectroscopy became popular after the development of the sum rules that enable the extraction of reliable information on the micro - magnetism directly from the experimental spectra.@xcite the great advantage of xmcd is that we can probe each atom and orbital in the system so to obtain information on the local magnetic properties . lately angle - dependent xmcd experiments allowed the determination of magnetic properties for different spin quantization axis .",
    "all experimental spectra for copt have been obtained by grange _",
    "et al_,@xcite and all calculated spectra presented in this section were obtained using the lsda .",
    "the gga produced the same results and are not presented .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] presents the xmcd spectra for cobalt and iron atoms for the [ 100 ] and [ 001 ] magnetization axis .",
    "we convoluted our theoretical spectra using a lorentzian width of 0.9 ev and a gaussian width of 0.4 ev as proposed by ebert,@xcite in the case of iron to account for the core hole effect and the experimental resolution , respectively .",
    "the energy difference between the @xmath3 and @xmath2 peaks is given by the spin - orbit splitting of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 core states .",
    "it is larger in the case of cobalt , 14.8 ev , than for iron , 12.5 ev .",
    "the intensities of the peaks are comparable for both atoms , but the cobalt peak - intensities are larger for the [ 001 ] axis contrary to the iron spectrum .",
    "the most important feature of these spectra is the integrated @xmath3/@xmath2 branching ratio as it enters the sum rules .",
    "it is larger in the case of cobalt site .",
    "this is expected since the sum rules predict that a larger @xmath3/@xmath2 ratio is equivalent to a larger orbital moment .",
    "for both atoms the integrated @xmath3/@xmath2 branching ratio is larger for the [ 001 ] axis .",
    "but the ratio anisotropy is larger for the cobalt site ( 1.32 for * m*@xmath20[001 ] and 1.17 for * m*@xmath20[100 ] ) than for the iron site ( 1.15 for * m*@xmath20[001 ] and 1.14 for * m*@xmath20[100 ] ) reflecting the larger orbital moment anisotropy of cobalt compared to iron ( see table [ table1 ] ) . especially for iron both orbital moment and integrated @xmath3/@xmath2 branching ratio are practically the same for both magnetization axis . as these changes in the xmcd signal are related to the change in the orbital magnetic moment between the two magnetization directions .",
    "the xmcd anisotropy should be roughly proportional to the underlying mca but no relation exist that connects these two anisotropies .",
    "however they are connected indirectly through the orbital moment anisotropy.@xcite    in figure [ fig9 ] we have plotted the platinum xmcd spectra for two angles @xmath8=10@xmath9 and 60@xmath9 for both compounds .",
    "the life time of the core - hole in platinum is smaller than for cobalt so the broadening used to account for its life time should be larger .",
    "we used both a lorentzian ( 1 ev ) and a gaussian ( 1 ev ) to represent this life time and a gaussian of 1 ev width for the experimental resolution .",
    "as in the case of cobalt and iron the platinum xmcd spectra change with the angle and depend on the surrounding neighbors .",
    "the peak intensities are larger in copt .",
    "also the difference in the intensity due to the anisotropy has different sign in the two compounds .",
    "the intensities of fept spectra for @xmath8=10@xmath9 are much larger than for @xmath8=60@xmath9 contrary to the copt behavior . as is the case for cobalt in copt , the platinum site integrated @xmath3/@xmath2 branching ratio shows larger anisotropy than for platinum in fept . in copt",
    "it is 1.49 for @xmath8=10@xmath9 and 1.19 for @xmath8=60@xmath9 , while for fept it is 1.20 for @xmath8=10@xmath9 and 1.14 for @xmath8=60@xmath9 .",
    "here again the xmcd follows the anisotropy of the orbital magnetic moment in these compounds .",
    "the energy difference between the two peaks is 1727 ev for both compounds .",
    "the 2@xmath4 electrons of platinum are deep in energy and are little influenced by the local environment , so that their spin - orbit splitting does not depend on the neighboring atoms of platinum .",
    "we expect a better agreement between the theoretical and the experimental xmcd spectra for the platinum site than for the cobalt site , because the core hole is deeper and would effect less the final states of the photo - excited electron . in figure [ fig6 ] ,",
    "we have plotted the absorption and the xmcd spectra of cobalt for @xmath8=0@xmath9 .",
    "we have scaled our spectra in a way that the experimental and theoretical @xmath3 peaks in the absorption spectra have the same intensity .",
    "the energy difference between the @xmath3 and @xmath2 peaks is in good agreement with experiment .",
    "but the intensity of the @xmath2 peak is larger than the corresponding experimental peak .",
    "the high intensity of the calculated @xmath2 edge makes the theoretical xmcd integrated @xmath3/@xmath2 branching ratio of 1.32 much smaller than the experimental ratio of 1.72 .",
    "this is because the lsda fails to represent the physics of the core hole photo - excited electron recombination . in the case of 3@xmath5 ferromagnets",
    "the core hole is shallow and influences the final states seen by the photo - excited electron .",
    "a formalism that can treat this electron - hole interaction has been proposed by schwitalla and ebert,@xcite but it failed to improve the @xmath3/@xmath2 branching ratio of xas of the late transition metals .",
    "benedict and shirley@xcite have also developed a scheme to treat this phenomena but its application is limited only to crystalline insulators .    in figure [ fig7 ]",
    "we have plotted experimental and theoretical total absorptions for the platinum atom in copt .",
    "for both @xmath2 and @xmath3 edges the theory gives a sharp peak which does not exist in experiment . as expected the @xmath3 peak is much more intense than the @xmath2 .",
    "in contrast to what is obtained for cobalt , the results for the platinum xmcd ( see figure [ fig8 ] ) show better agreement with experiment , due to the fact that the core hole effect is less intense ( core hole much deeper compared to cobalt ) .",
    "the experimental and theoretical @xmath2 and @xmath3 edges are separated by a spin - orbit splitting of the @xmath21 core states of 1709 and 1727ev respectively .",
    "the width of both @xmath2 and @xmath3 edges is comparable to experiment , but the calculated @xmath2 edge is much larger .",
    "this produces a calculated integrated branching ratio of 1.49 which is much smaller than the experimental ratio of 2.66 . here",
    "again the theory is underestimating the branching ratio .",
    "in figure  [ fig10 ] we present the band structure along the [ 001 ] and [ 100 ] axis in the reciprocal space for different angles @xmath8 for the copt compound within the lsda . we know that it is essentially the area around the fermi level that changes with respect to the spin quantization axis . for this reason",
    "we have enlarged a region of @xmath221 ev around the fermi level . in the first panel",
    "we plot the relativistic band structure for @xmath8=0@xmath9 . in the second and third panel",
    "we have plotted the relativistic band structure for @xmath8=45@xmath9 and @xmath8=90@xmath9 .",
    "we remark that as the angle increases there are bands that approach the fermi level and cross it .",
    "however this information concerns just two high symmetry directions . for this reason we limited ourselves to the changes in the total dos . in figure [ fig11 ]",
    "we notice that just below the fermi level the dos for the hard axis is lower than for the easy axis which seems to favor the hard axis .",
    "this means that the anisotropy does not originate from the changes ate the vicinity of the fermi level but from that of the whole dos .",
    "it is difficult to investigate this phenomena by inspection of the changes at the vicinity of the fermi surface and to explain the sign of the mca .",
    "our results confirm the work of daalderop and collaborators@xcite that argued that not only states in the vicinity of the fermi surface contribute to the mae , as originally thought,@xcite but states far away make an equally important contribution .",
    "we have performed a theoretical _ ab - initio _ study of the magnetic properties of the ordered copt and fept fct alloys systems .",
    "the calculated easy axis is the [ 001 ] for both compounds in agreement with other calculations and with experiments on films which found a strong perpendicular magnetization axis .",
    "the density of states is found to change very little with the direction of the spin quantization axis , and hence the magnetic moments are isotropic with respect to the magnetization axis .",
    "contrary to the spin moments , the orbital magnetic moments decrease with the angle @xmath8 up to 75@xmath9 ( @xmath8 is the angle between the spin quantization axis and the [ 001 ] axis ) .",
    "the calculated x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) for all the atoms reflect the behavior of the orbital moments .",
    "especially platinum resolved spectra present large differences between the two compounds .",
    "cobalt xmcd spectra are in agreement with experiment but as usual the @xmath3/@xmath2 ratio is underestimated by the theory .",
    "the platinum site shows better agreement with experiments because the core - hole is much deeper than in the case of cobalt .",
    "finally we showed that all the occupied electronic states contribute to the magneto - crystalline anisotropy and not just states near the fermi level for both copt and fept .",
    "we thank j. m. wills for providing us with his fplmto code .",
