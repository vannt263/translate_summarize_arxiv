    "ever since the study of hydrogen atom inside an impenetrable spherical enclosure @xcite , confinement of quantum systems has witnessed many burgeoning activity in past few decades .",
    "this work was motivated by an attempt to understand effects of extreme pressure on electronic states . in such extremely small spatial dimensions ,",
    "many fascinating phenomena occur in a quantum confined system , relative to the respective free system .",
    "some of these relate to , e.g. , thermodynamic properties in non - ideal gases , anharmonic effects in solids , impurity binding in quantum wells , partially ionized plasmas , mesoscopic scale artificial structures , etc .",
    "gradually their importance was realized in various potential applications in physics and chemistry , such as quantum wells , quantum wires , quantum dots , etc .",
    "they have also relevance in the development of numerous nano - sized circuits including quantum computers .",
    "usually , their unique physical , chemical properties are attributed to complex energy changes associated with them .",
    "most widely studied quantum systems are particle in a box , harmonic oscillator , h atom , he and other many - electron atoms , as well as h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 and other molecules .",
    "the literature is vast ; here we mention a few representatives @xcite .",
    "confinement problem in 1d confined harmonic oscillator ( cho ) has been theoretically investigated by a number of workers over a long period of time @xcite .",
    "for example , the effect of finite boundaries on a 1d cho inside a potential enclosure was studied by means of wkb method @xcite .",
    "perturbative , asymptotic and pad approximant solutions for boxed - in harmonic and inverted oscillators were reported @xcite .",
    "eigenfunctions , eigenvalues in such 1d potentials were also obtained by means of a hypervirial method @xcite .",
    "accurate energies of 1d polynomial potentials having single and multiple wells inside a box were calculated through a rayleigh - ritz variation method by using a basis set of trigonometric functions @xcite . a robust , strongly convergent numerical method has been proposed for harmonic , quartic and sextic oscillators @xcite . also , the trapped harmonic and quartic oscillators have been studied by a wkb method with appropriate boundary condition @xcite .",
    "this employed a modified airy function method that ultimately leads to a modified bohr - sommerfeld - type quantization rule .",
    "eigenvalues , dipole moments , einstein coefficients of cho have been considered by perturbation method @xcite as well .",
    "symmetric and asymmetric confinement was studied in @xcite by a power series expansion and numerical method .    in parallel to the 1d problem mentioned above , some attention was been paid for similar studies in 2d , 3d and higher dimension , however with lesser intensity @xcite .",
    "several unique phenomena occur in such systems , especially related to _ simultaneous , incidental and interdimensional _",
    "degeneracy @xcite . in one of the earliest studies",
    "a hypervirial treatment was suggested for multidimensional isotropic bounded oscillators , including 3d cho @xcite .",
    "the 2d and 3d chos enclosed in circular and spherical boxes were considered in @xcite by a rayleigh - schrdinger perturbative expansion as well as pad approximant solution .",
    "a variational method @xcite was proposed where the trial function was constructed as a product of  free \" solutions of corresponding schrdinger equation .",
    "however , the first systematic and accurate ground , excited states of 3d cho ( in terms of energies , eigenfunctions , spatial expectation values ) with respect to box size were obtained in variational calculation of @xcite .",
    "later , results were also obtained by a wkb method @xcite . a super - symmetric method @xcite also offered reasonably accurate results .",
    "the @xmath2-dimensional cho enclosed in an impenetrable spherical cavity was also computed by searching for the roots of hypergeometric function @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "later , high - precision energies for @xmath2-dimensional cho were presented by exploiting certain properties of hypergeometric function within the maple computer algebra system @xcite .",
    "very recently , a combination of wkb method and a proper quantization rule has been advocated for cho energy levels @xcite .",
    "energy characteristics of a 2d isotropic cho , enclosed in a symmetric box were followed through annihilation and creation operators coupled with the infinitesimal operators of su(2 ) group @xcite .",
    "likewise , characteristic features in energy spectrum of 3d cho were established by invoking analytical properties of bessel and confluent hypergeometric functions . however , the most extensively studied confined system is h atom .",
    "a vast amount of reference exists on the subject emphasizing different kinds of confinement and theoretical methods @xcite .    in present communication , we are interested in the confinement studies in 3d quantum polynomial oscillators . it may be noted that while all these above methods produce reasonably good - quality results , only two @xcite of these offer energies with ten or higher significant figure accuracy for 3d oscillators . moreover , there is a lack of good results in the _ low radius of confinement _ , and _ higher excited states_. further , while a substantial amount of accurate results exist for enclosed h atom problem , same for 3d cho is much less and almost none for other polynomial potentials .",
    "we will use the generalized pseudospectral ( gps ) method for this purpose , which in recent years , has been successfully applied to a wide range of _ unconfined _ physical and chemical systems .",
    "some of these are spiked harmonic oscillator , hulthn , yukawa , logarithmic , rational , power - law potentials , ro - vibrational levels in molecules as well as ground and rydberg states in atoms , etc .",
    "@xcite . only in @xcite , however , this was employed for confined quantum states . there",
    ", a few low - lying states such as @xmath4 of 3d cho were examined ; additionally some degeneracy conditions were established .",
    "however a detailed performance of the gps method in case of _ confined _ systems has not been made so far . in this work , we want to test its validity and relevance in such a context , which could extend its domain of applicability to larger set of problems . to this end , eigenvalues , eigenfunctions , expectation values are reported for low , high states . a detailed variation of eigenvalues with box size is also presented .",
    "correlation between energies in _ free _ and respective _ confined _ system is discussed .",
    "further , a similar study is made on quartic oscillator , which was not done before .",
    "finally we consider confinement in even - degree polynomial oscillators ( up to 20 ) in terms of changes in ground - state energy with radius of confinement .",
    "section ii gives a brief outline of the method used .",
    "results are discussed in section iii .",
    "we conclude with a few remarks in section iv .",
    "the gps method has been found to be very successful for various physical and chemical systems as evidenced by the following applications @xcite .",
    "therefore here we highlight only the essential aspects .",
    "unless otherwise mentioned , atomic unit is employed .    the single - particle , non - relativistic time - independent radial schrdinger equation can be written in following form ( the problem is separable in radial and angular variables ) , @xmath5 \\psi_{n,\\ell}(r ) = e_{n,\\ell}\\ \\psi_{n,\\ell}(r)\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is a polynomial potential of degree @xmath7 containing only the dominant term , i.e. , @xmath8 . in this work we consider @xmath9 , while @xmath10 , @xmath11 signify usual radial and angular momentum quantum numbers respectively .",
    "last term in square bracket represents the confinement potential ( @xmath12 is the radius of confining spherical box ) , @xmath13 this equation needs to be solved with dirichlet boundary condition @xmath14 .",
    "a very distinctive feature of this approach is that it allows one to work in a _",
    "nonuniform _ , _ optimal _ spatial discretization ; a coarser mesh at larger @xmath15 and a denser mesh at smaller @xmath15 , while maintaining similar accuracies at both regions .",
    "thus , compared to many other methods , much smaller number of grid point often suffices to recover very good accuracy for low and high states .    at first , a function @xmath16 defined in an interval @xmath17 $ ] is approximated by an n - th order polynomial @xmath18 , @xmath19 so that the approximation is _ exact _ at _ collocation points _",
    "@xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath21 in the legendre pseudospectral method used here , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , while @xmath24 are obtained from roots of first derivative of legendre polynomial @xmath25 with respect to @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath27 cardinal functions , @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) satisfy the relation , @xmath29 .",
    "next , one can map the semi - infinite domain @xmath30 $ ] onto finite domain @xmath17 $ ] by a transformation @xmath31 and introduce a nonlinear algebraic mapping of following form , @xmath32 where l and @xmath33 are two adjustable mapping parameters . now , introducing a transformation of the type @xmath34 followed by a symmetrization procedure leads to a _ symmetric _",
    "matrix eigenvalue problem which can be easily solved by standard available routines ( nag libraries used ) to yield accurate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions .",
    "sample calculations were performed for a sufficiently large sets of mapping parameters to monitor the accuracy and reliability of present method , so as to produce `` stable '' results with respect to reference results .",
    "this lead to a choice of @xmath35 , which appeared to be satisfactory for the problem at hand .",
    "results in various tables are reported only up to the precision that maintained stability and they are _ truncated _ rather than _ rounded - off_. thus , they may be considered as correct up to the decimal place given .",

    "a detailed analysis has been made to understand confinement in the family of 3d anharmonic oscillators of even order enclosed within spherically impenetrable walls .",
    "energies , expectation values , radial densities are obtained by means of gps method .",
    "for isotropic 3d cho , these quantities show excellent agreement with the best reference results available in literature , covering _ small , intermediate and large _ radius of confinement .",
    "it may be noted that , good - quality results in confined systems are obtainable by a number of attractive and elegant methodologies for _ medium and large _ @xmath12 ; however , same for small @xmath12 is rather scarce . in this work ,",
    "we are able to generate quite good results in both these regions with equal ease and efficacy .",
    "also , similar accuracy results are also offered in case of high - lying states .",
    "a thorough analysis of energy changes with respect to confinement radius has been made .",
    "energy ordering in case of 3d cho and free oscillator , as well as the degeneracy pattern is also discussed .",
    "several interesting mixings have been pointed out .",
    "next , we perform similar investigation on 3d quartic oscillator",
    ". finally we briefly touch upon the case of 3d isotropic even - order isotropic bounded oscillators for higher orders up to as high as 20 . once again , low- and high - lying states in the confined system and free oscillator are presented in some detail .",
    "energy changes with variations in @xmath12 are monitored for selected low - lying states in such oscillators .",
    "the method also delivers excellent quality results in case of unconfined oscillators .",
    "comparison with literature data reveals very good agreement in case of small as well as large box sizes .",
    "confinement studies in other physical and chemical situations such as the h atom or many - electron atoms may further consolidate the success of this approach , some of which may be taken up in future works .",
