    "considerable effort has gone into acquiring photometric information that would elucidate the physical processes active in distant clusters and their effects on the evolution of both the star - forming ( lavery & henry 1994 ; lubin 1996 ; rakos & schombert 1995 ; rakos , odell & schombert 1997 ) and passive galaxies ( aragn - salamanca et al .",

    "further impetus has been provided by observations of the recent transformation of the s0 population of clusters ( dressler et al .",
    "1997 ) , which may allow a closer connection to be drawn between the galaxy populations of distant clusters and the evolutionary signatures found in their local universe counterparts ( caldwell & rose 1997 ; bothun & gregg 1990 ) .    however , it was the advent of spectroscopic surveys of the distant cluster populations ( e.g.   dressler & gunn 1983 , 1992 , dg92 ; couch & sharples 1987 , cs87 ; barger et al .  1996 ; abraham et al .",
    "1996 ; fisher et al .  1998 ) which uncovered the real breadth of the changes in galaxies in these environments , including several spectral signatures of evolutionary change , such as evidence for a strong decline in the star - formation rates of many cluster galaxies in the recent past .",
    "the advent of high spatial resolution imaging with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) provided a further breakthrough , giving morphological information on the galaxies in these distant clusters .",
    "this could be used to link the evolution of stellar populations in the galaxies with the evolution of their _ structure _ , in order to understand how the various galaxy types we see in the local universe came to be .",

    "the aim of this paper is to combine the morphological information available from our _ hst _ images with detailed star - formation properties of the cluster galaxies derived from targeted spectroscopic observations . to this end",
    "we have used over 27 clear , dark nights over the past 4 years on the palomar 5.1-m ( p200 ) , 4.2-m william herschel telescope ( wht ) and the 3.5-m new technology telescope ( ntt ) to assemble a large catalog of spectroscopic data on galaxies in these clusters .",

    "the object selection is closer to that employed by dg92 , than the magnitude - limited selection criteria of cs87 and barger et al .",
    "the latter approach has some claim to making the subsequent analysis simpler , especially when the sample is selected in the near - ir .",
    "however , it is a very inefficient method for studying the faint , blue cluster members as it produces samples dominated by passive spheroidal cluster members .",
    "we chose instead to base our object selection upon galaxy morphology within the region covered by our _ wfpc2 _ imaging , while being approximately magnitude - limited outside that area ( selected from ground - based @xmath11 or @xmath12 ccd material to limits of @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) .",
    "we note at this point that two of the cluster fields , a370 field2 and cl0939@xmath1047 field2 , lie outside of the central regions of their respective clusters ( although we do also have observations of the core regions as well ) .",
    "the difference in the galaxy density between the fields should be kept in mind in the following analysis , although we will highlight such selection effects for individual figures when they are discussed below .",
    "modelling of the sample selection for the entire spectroscopic catalog is dealt with in more detail in p98 .",
    "the spectroscopic observations discussed in this paper were undertaken with a variety of facilities over the period 19931997 .",
    "we list the instruments and telescopes employed and the total number of nights used in table  1 .",
    "the basic details of the 10 clusters targeted in this study are listed in table  2 , this includes the mean cluster redshift , the one dimensional velocity dispersion ( @xmath15 , see  3.2 ) , the redshift range used to define cluster membership ( @xmath16 ) , the field center and the _ hst _ _ wfpc2 _ filters used in the observations .",
    "the new spectra presented here are typically of high quality due to both the long exposure times employed in our observations and the combination of the high efficiency of the multi - object spectrographs and the large aperture of the telescopes used .",
    "we give in table  3 the logs of the observing runs for the various telescopes .",
    "we list the mask identification , the dates of the observations , the total exposure time and the number of objects extracted from each mask ( n ) .",
    "the slit width typically used was 1.5arcsec , with slits between 1020 arcsec long .",
    "the exact size of the region on the slit used to extract the galaxy spectrum depended upon the relative signal to noise of the galaxy spectrum , but varied between 1.18.4arcsec for the cosmic spectra with a mean length of @xmath17arcsec . at the median redshift of the clusters in our catalog , the spectra thus sample a physical scale of @xmath18 kpc .",
    "the exact details of the extraction and reduction of the spectra depends upon the instrument and set - up used .",
    "however , the basic steps were the same for all the data and we outline the procedures used for both the cosmic and wht / ntt data .",
    "the raw frames were debiased using the over - scan regions on the chip , before being trimmed .",
    "a two dimensional flatfield was constructed by dividing the flatfield exposure by a low - order fit in the dispersion direction .",
    "the data frame was then divided by this normalized flatfield , this served to correct for the pixel - to - pixel response of the detector .",
    "the sequence of data frames for each mask taken on a single night were then checked for spatial offsets between the exposures arising from flexure in the spectrograph ( these are typically only @xmath19 pixels for cosmic in the course of a night ) . if necessary",
    "the exposures were shifted in the spatial and/or dispersion direction to align them and then combined with a cosmic - ray rejection algorithm using the iraf task imcombine .",
    "this produced a two dimensional image of the mask exposure clean of cosmic ray events .",
    "these frames were then geometrically remapped to align the spectra along the rows of the detector .",
    "this step is necessary to remove the distortion of the spectra on the detector introduced by the spectrograph optics .",
    "the distortion is only a large effect for objects in slits near the edge of cosmic s large @xmath20 field of view , although aligning the spectra also helps when tracing some of the faintest objects .",
    "the distortion of the spectra are mapped using the positions of the emission lines in the arc exposure taken after every science exposure .",
    "the positions of objects in each slit on the remapped frame , as well as regions of clear sky surrounding them , were then defined interactively using the iraf package apextract .",
    "the exact position of the object within the slit was traced in the dispersion direction and fitted with a low - order polynomial to allow for atmospheric refraction .",
    "the spectra were then sky - subtracted and extracted using optimal weighting to produce one dimensional spectra .",
    "the arc exposures associated with each science exposure were remapped and extracted in exactly the same manner ( although with no sky - subtraction ) and these were used to determine the wavelength calibration for the science exposure .",
    "we estimate our wavelength scale is good to 0.2  rms . finally , the one dimensional spectra were smoothed to the instrumental resolution , @xmath21 , and rebinned to 10  per pixel to make them more manageable .",
    "the spectra obtained with cosmic have not been flux calibrated .",
    "the wht and ntt spectra have been reduced using the lext package , purposely written for reducing ldss2 spectra , and the midas software package .",
    "what follows is a brief description of the reduction procedure generally adopted .",
    "a number of twilight and dome flatfields , and several arc frames were obtained for each mask , as well as numerous bias frames and long  slit spectra of standard stars for flux calibration ( at least one star per night ) .",
    "the raw frames were first debiased and then divided by the corresponding normalized flatfield .",
    "they were then calibrated in wavelength with the arcs frames obtained either with a cuar or hearne combination of lamps .",
    "subtraction step was performed with an interactive choice of the spatial limits of the spectrum , which was then extracted summing the counts weighted with a gaussian .",
    "the long  slit stellar spectrum was reduced in a similar way as the target spectra and a response function was derived by the comparison with a tabulated spectrum .",
    "each spectrum was flux  calibrated in @xmath22 by dividing for this response function . in the case of the wht and ntt",
    "spectra each exposure of a given mask was reduced and calibrated separately , before all the spectra of a given galaxy were coadded ; no smoothing or rebinning was applied .",
    "the full digital catalog of fits spectra collected for this program is distributed in electronic form on the aas web site .",
    "these spectra are also available from : http://www.ociw.edu/@xmath23irs .",
    "the full catalog of objects observed spectroscopically in the 10 clusters is given in tables  4 ( the complete tables are included on the aas web site as well as being available from http://www.ociw.edu/@xmath23irs ) .",
    "this has been split into `` cluster '' and `` field '' samples as described below .",
    "the tables list not only the spectral information on the galaxies , but also any available morphological and photometric data from s97 and dg92 .",
    "a key to the various parameters and the format of the tables are given in table  5 .",
    "we now describe in more detail the measurement of some of the spectral parameters listed in tables  4 .",
    "the quality of the spectra , both in terms of signal - to - noise and sky - subtraction , was visually assessed by ad for _ all _ of the spectra presented .",
    "the spectra are graded on a 4point range , with @xmath24 signifying the best and @xmath25 the worst quality . of the complete catalog 17%",
    "have @xmath24 , 47% with @xmath26 and 89% are @xmath27 .",
    "spectra with @xmath27 have sufficient signal to noise ( s / n ) for not only measurement of a redshift , but also to quantify the strength of any spectral features present .  from the continuum regions around the [ oii]@xmath13727 and h@xmath28 lines we estimate median s / n of 40.2 ( @xmath24 ) , 28.3 ( @xmath29 ) and 19.7 ( @xmath30 ) , with lower limits to the s / n of 20.9 , 10.6 and 4.6 respectively for these three quality classes .",
    "repeated observations suggest that the redshifts of @xmath24 and @xmath29 cases are correct at a confidence of greater than 98% , and that @xmath30 cases are correct at a confidence of greater than 90% .",
    "in contrast , those spectra with @xmath25 are of sufficient s / n to provide only a redshift , which may be uncertain in a significant number of cases .",
    "redshifts were measured from the spectra interactively using purpose - written software that compares the wavelengths of redshifted absorption and emission lines with features in the spectra .",
    "whenever possible we used a number of features to estimate the redshift , and only in a very small number of cases is a redshift based on only a single feature  these instances are noted in the comments in tables  4 .",
    "we list in column 24 of tables  4 the main features used to identify the galaxy redshifts . for conciseness we have used the following abbreviations to identify the lines : babs , balmer absorption lines ; ha , h@xmath31 ; hb , h@xmath32 ; hd , h@xmath28 ; he , h@xmath33 ; heta , h@xmath34 ; hg , h@xmath35 ; hth , h@xmath36 ; hz , h@xmath37 ; g , g - band ; h&k , ca h or k ; mg , mg - b ; na , na - d ; oii , [ oii]@xmath13727 ; oiii , [ oiii]@xmath14959,5007 ; bk , 4000break ; mgii , mgii@xmath12799 ; ciii , ciii]@xmath11909 ; civ , civ@xmath11549 ; fei , fei@xmath15268 ; nii , [ nii]@xmath16583 ; sii , [ sii]@xmath16716,6731 .",
    "the strength of emission and absorption features in the spectra were measured using purpose - written software , allowing the positioning of the continuum to be defined interactively .",
    "we give the restframe equivalent widths ( ew ) for [ oii]@xmath13727 and h@xmath28 in columns 5 and 6 of table  4a and 4b , in all instances a line seen in emission is given a negative value and is quoted in  . the presence and strength of these lines",
    "is used in the spectral classification scheme discussed in  3.2 .",
    "if other lines in the spectrum were measurable we list their ew in the comments .",
    "we give line strengths for not only those galaxies observed for this work , but also those from the early survey of dg92 .",
    "the d4000 measurements have been similarly placed on a consistent system .",
    "these are measured using wavelength intervals as defined in dressler and shectman ( 1987 ) .",
    "the cosmic data shared a common relation of counts to flux , but were not flux calibrated per se . a multiplicative correction of 1.34 to convert the measured d4000 to true d4000 for these data was derived by comparing the cosmic spectra of repeated objects with the equivalent flux calibrated dg92 spectra .",
    "this procedure , though imperfect , generates reasonable and consistent results , as shown by multiple cosmic observations of the same galaxies .",
    "we have a total of 31 repeat observations , both internally within the datasets from a single telescope , and between telescopes .",
    "we find median rms scatters of @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) , @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) and @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) for those spectra with @xmath27 , and no systematic offsets between any of the individual datasets : @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "we therefore conclude that there are no significant offsets between the redshifts from the different datasets and hence we are confident that we can include all the observed objects in our analysis .",

    "this aim was not straightforward because the code that best measured the equivalent widths , which is based on a gaussian line - fitting program written by paul schechter , does not perform well when the lines are weak or undetectable .",
    "for this reason , when we measured the strengths of features in those galaxies where the feature was not clearly seen , we by necessity had to measure equivalent widths using the standard technique of obtaining the continuum level from straddling continuum bands , and measuring the decrement or increment in signal relative to the continuum in an interval containing the feature .",

    "the intervals are , again , as defined in dressler and shectman ( 1987 ) . for weak , but measurable , cases the line - fitting and flux - summing techniques give equivalent results , though for strong absorption lines , in particular , the latter seems to underestimate the strength of the feature , apparently by allowing the wings of the line to lower the continuum level .",

    "1a and fig .  1b , where we have plotted the equivalent widths as a function of signal - to - noise ratio in the continuum bands straddling the feature . in fig .",
    "1b we show that the galaxies that were designated by inspection as emission line types all have [ oii ] ew stronger than @xmath63 , while those designated as having no emission lines ( spectral types : k , k+a , or a+k , see  3.3 ) have [ oii ] ew weaker than @xmath64 .",
    "in fact , the latter are consistent with non - detections : for 37 non - emission line members , the median ew is + 0.4  with quartiles of @xmath65 to + 2.6 .",
    "there is only a weak trend with signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we conclude from these data that we are complete for [ oii ] stronger than @xmath66 , with a high level of completeness down to @xmath63 . in other words , even at the modest signal - to - noise ratios of these spectra , none of the galaxies classified as non - emission types are likely to have emission at greater than the @xmath63  level , and certainly none have emission stronger than @xmath66  ( this limit corresponds to `` absent '' in table  6 ) .    in fig .",
    "1b we show a similar diagram for the same sample , this time for h@xmath28 .",
    "because it is weaker and in absorption , h@xmath28 is a more difficult feature to measure ; this is apparent from the stronger trend with signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "however , as for [ oii ] , the separation of those galaxies which are designated by inspection as having moderate balmer line strengths ( k+a , a+k , and e(a ) , see  3.3 ) from the non - balmer galaxies ( k and e(c ) and e(b ) types ) , is confirmed by the objective measurements .",

    "it is worth commenting that some of the points with large negative equivalent widths for h@xmath28 arise from strange continuum levels , rather than from the feature seen in emission ( although there is at least one clear case of h@xmath28 in emission , a rare phenomena among luminous galaxies ) .",
    "as was noted above , table  4 is split into two parts on the basis of whether a galaxy is classed as a `` cluster '' member or `` field '' . to accomplish this",
    "we define redshift ranges for the various clusters ; these ranges are purposefully chosen to be large to ensure that we retain any galaxies in the large - scale structure surrounding the clusters , while at the same time minimizing the contamination by field galaxies . in fig .",
    "2 we show the redshift distributions for the individual cluster fields ; in each panel the inset provides a more detailed view of the velocity distribution close to the cluster mean .",
    "the bin size in these plots has been arbitrarily chosen and may artificially enhance or suppress the visibility of any structures within the clusters .",
    "we list the resulting mean redshift , restframe velocity dispersion and redshift range defining each cluster in table  2 .",
    "we reiterate that the velocity dispersions are likely to be overestimates of the true dispersion of the well - mixed cluster population .",

    "redshift distributions for the fields of our 10 clusters .",
    "we show the redshift range @xmath671 in the full plot and then , in the insets , an expanded region ( width @xmath68 ) centered on the cluster redshift , in the inset panels we show the cluster members as a filled histogram and the field galaxies as open .",
    "the redshift axis in the inset panel is marked with @xmath69 increments and the vertical axis is the same as the main panel .",
    "the redshift distribution for all galaxies classed as field is shown as the open histogram in fig .  3 ; the galaxies with _ hst _ morphologies are shown as the filled histogram .",
    "the median redshift of the whole field sample is @xmath70 , while for the morphological sub - sample it is slightly higher at @xmath71 ( fig .",
    "these values are very similar to the median redshift of our 10 clusters , @xmath72 , allowing us to easily compare the broad properties of the cluster and field samples .",

    "3 we may be seeing some evidence for a deficit in the total field redshift distribution , between @xmath730.6 , which would result from the inclusion of a few field galaxies in the cluster catalog . this would include galaxies in the supercluster environment , if any , in which the clusters reside , or truly unassociated galaxies relatively far from the cluster but within the wide velocity limits imposed by the cluster s velocity dispersion . to estimate the extent of this effect we use two approaches .",
    "firstly , a conservative upper limit on the deficit comes from linearally extrapolating the trends of number versus redshift in the field at @xmath74 and @xmath75 to limit the likely number of field galaxies in the intervening redshift range .  from this",
    "we estimate that there should be @xmath76 field galaxies in the range @xmath770.6 , compared to the observed number of 92 , giving an upper limit on the deficit of @xmath78 galaxies , or @xmath79 per cluster . alternatively , using the regions where the redshift limits of the cluster and field samples overlap between different clusters we estimate the contamination from random , unrelated field galaxies is of the order of @xmath80 galaxies per cluster in our largest velocity range . we conclude therefore that the contamination from galaxies unrelated to the cluster , or its supercluster , does not exceed 7 galaxies per cluster and is probably closer to 12 galaxies .      to assess the distribution in the star - formation properties of galaxies in our catalog we have found it useful to classify their spectra into a number of classes .",
    "these classes are broadly based upon those used by dg92 and cs87 , however , the number of classes has been expanded to better cover the full range of features seen in our large sample .",
    "we have also used the properties of low redshift integrated spectra ( kennicutt 1992 ) and the expected characteristics from spectral modelling to help us define the limits of some of the classes . in revising the classifications we therefore found it necessary to redefine some of the boundaries previously used for the spectral classes .",
    "hence , to reduce confusion between our new classes and those used previously we adopt a new nomenclature and give this and the details of the classification scheme in table  6 .",
    "we show a schematic representation of this spectral classification in fig .",
    "it should be noted that for those spectra where sky residuals or the available spectral range precluded the observation of one of the diagnostic spectral features , we have made used the strength of the other balmer series lines ( if h@xmath28 was unobservable ) or emission lines ( if [ oii ] was unobservable ) to identify the most likely spectral class . in the few cases where",

    "are not marked .",
    "briefly the overlap between the new system and previous ones can be summarized as follows : we retain the general features of the dg92 system , including k - type and the general class of `` e '' ( emission ) galaxies .",
    "however , we replace the mixed nomenclature `` e+a '' with k+a ( following the suggestion of franx 1993 ) and a+k , depending on the strength of the h@xmath28 balmer line .",
    "we also subdivide emission line galaxies into e(a ) types ( with strong balmer absorption ) , e(c ) for those with weak or moderate balmer absorption , and e(b ) for those with very strong [ oii ] ( this can sometimes be combined with e(a ) for galaxies with both strong [ oii ] emission and strong balmer absorption ) .",
    "this nomenclature reflects the nature of the spectra , with e(a ) indicating a population of a stars , e(b ) a spectrum similar to that expected for a burst of star - formation and e(c ) a spectrum for a system undergoing a more constant sfr .",

    "the expected evolution can be estimated from the change in the incidence of close pairs ( zepf & koo 1989 ; patton et al .",
    "1997 ) , which would be predicted to be the parent population .",
    "patton et al .",
    "( 1997 ) claim that the proportion of close pairs ( two galaxies within 20@xmath3 kpc ) increases by a factor of @xmath119 between @xmath67 and @xmath120 . extrapolating",
    "this behavior to @xmath121 would predict an increase in the fraction of close pairs of @xmath1223 over that seen locally .",
    "although we see at most a factor of two increase in the k+a population from low to high redshift using the lcrs and our sample , this does not rule out that a significant fraction of field k+a s are due to such mergers .",
    "zabludoff et al .  argue further that , as the merger / interaction mechanism appears to be responsible for low - redshift field examples of such galaxies , it is reasonable to conclude that mergers may also be responsible for the k+a / a+k galaxies in the intermediate - redshift clusters .",
    "however , the radically different evolution described above of the k+a / a+k population between cluster and field environments suggests that the cluster environment _ is _ crucial in either the formation of _ cluster _",
    "k+a / a+k galaxies , or in prolonging their visibility .",
    "this could in part be due to an increased propensity for mergers in the groups infalling into the intermediate - redshift clusters .",
    "however , our morphological analysis ( s97 ) finds only a minority of cases of k+a spectra where the galaxy shows signs of a classic two - body merger , as zabludoff et al .",
    "found for the low - redshift field examples .",
    "we conclude , then , that at least one mechanism other than mergers is responsible for the large fraction of k+a / a+k galaxies in intermediate - redshift clusters .",
    "as we discuss in b98 , the majority of k+a / a+k spectra are the result of a sudden decline in star formation rate that followed a substantial rise , or burst , of star - formation , leaving a population of a - stars to dominate the light for @xmath123 years . given the generic nature of the star - formation history required to form an a+k / k+a ,",
    "mergers are obviously not a unique explanation for the k+a / a+k phenomena .",
    "for example , accretion of smaller satellites , instead of mergers of comparable mass systems , is not inconsistent with the morphologies we see .",
    "the greater fraction of a+k / a+k galaxies in the intermediate - redshift clusters as compared to the field is likely to be connected as well with the frequency of e(a ) galaxies in these environments ( b98 ) .      as a final exercise in the comparison of spectroscopic properties with other cluster characteristics ,",
    "we examine the radial distributions of our cluster sample as a function of spectroscopic type .",
    "we begin by assigning field centers  these positions are given in table  2 .",
    "there is usually little ambiguity of this due to the presence of a d or cd galaxy , these have been confirmed as the cluster centers in all cases from our the weak lensing analysis in smail et al .",
    "( 1997b ) . even in more complex cases , such as cl1447@xmath1026",
    ", the ambiguity in choosing a center will play little role over the large range in radius we investigate .",
    "fig .  13 .  the cumulative radial distribution of different spectral types .",
    "these are shown for the all members from the whole sample which have @xmath95 .",
    "there is a clear difference between the radial distribution of k , k+a / a+k , and e type galaxies , with the former being most concentrated , the latter the least .",
    "the k+a / a+k class seems to be intermediate between the two showing a similar decline to the k types on the outskirts of the cluster , but a flatter distribution in the core , more in keeping with that seen for the e types .    in fig .",
    "13 we show for the combined clusters the cumulative radial distribution for different spectroscopic types .",
    "this procedure is crude because it averages over the non - spherical distribution of galaxies within the clusters , but it may provide some insight into the characteristic distributions of different classes of galaxies . not surprisingly , the k types , generally made up of e and s0 galaxies ( fig .",
    "10 ) , but including significant early - type spirals as well , are the most concentrated population in these clusters ( c.f .",
    "also , not surprisingly , the emission line galaxies strongly avoid the center ( @xmath124kpc ) of these clusters and have a much more extended distribution .",
    "what is perhaps more interesting is the way the k+a / a+k types , which may sensibly interpreted as post - starburst galaxies , avoid the centers in contrast to the k types , but are far less extended than the emission - line galaxies .. ] the near absence of k+a types in the field , discussed above , coupled with the sudden rise in their frequency as the cluster center is approached , with an almost complete demise in the central regions , appears to be clear evidence for the environment effecting either their formation or visibility .",
    "we note in passing that a similar diagram subdividing the e types into e(a ) , e(c ) , and e(b ) shows no significant difference , though there is a hint that the e(a ) class has a slightly more extended distribution .",

    "a similar difference is noticeable when the sample is split into different spectral classes ( now including the whole spectroscopic catalog of members ) .",
    "interestingly the galaxies whose spectra were too poor to be classified , the `` ? '' class , show the lowest dispersion  suggesting that these may be predominantly passive , cluster galaxies .",
    "the strongest trend is the significantly higher velocity dispersion of the presently or recently star - forming systems compared to the passive population ( c.f .",
    "dressler 1986 ) .",
    "in particular , combining the different spectral classes ( e(all ) comprises e(a)/e(b)/e(c)/e(n)/e ) from table  8 we find that the emission - line and k - type galaxies have relative dispersions of @xmath135 , with the k+a / a+k galaxies being intermediate between the two .",
    "the higher dispersions of the active populations are consistent with these galaxies being less virialised than the k - type population .",
    "such a trend can also be discerned in the variation of velocity with activity ( as traced by the [ oii ] ew ) _ within _ the individual morphological types .",
    "splitting each of the more active morphological classes ( sb - sd / irr ) at its median [ oii ] ew into `` low '' and `` high '' activity samples we find the dispersions listed at the bottom of table  8 for the different morphological samples .",
    "for all three morphological types , the more active sample shows the higher velocity dispersion .",
    "a higher velocity dispersion is often taken as a sign of an infalling population , but , as we discuss below , including spatial information in our analysis shows only weak evidence for infall .",
    "we note that the [ oii ] ew distributions for these active cluster members do not show any enhanced activity over that seen in the surrounding field for any given morphological type ( c.f .  ",
    "4.2 ) . apparently ,",
    "then , the observed correlation of velocity dispersion and activity ( as measured by [ oii ] ew ) is not triggered by a mechanism which causes the higher star - formation rates due to the high relative velocities of the galaxies within the clusters ( i.e.  ram - pressure induced star - formation ) .",
    "we suggest instead that the correlation between activity and velocity dispersion reflects a decline in star - formation in the galaxies which runs in parallel with and is causally linked their virialization within the clusters . in this",
    "regard we also mention the trend for more disturbed galaxies to have higher velocity dispersions , table  8 , a result which remains when we restrict the analysis to late - type galaxies , sb  irr .",
    "we next combine the velocity and positional information for the entire sample of clusters , focusing on the spectral classes , to calculate the velocity dispersion as a function of spectral class and radius .",
    "dressler ( 1986 ) used the giovanelli and haynes ( 19zz ) catalog of spirals in nearby clusters to show that gas - poor spirals tend to travel on radial orbits that take them into the cluster center , as compared to the more isotropic orbits of the gas - rich spirals . here",
    "we divide the k , k+a / a+k , and emission - line classes into three bins of radial position , each containing one - third of their respective samples .",

    "the velocity dispersions of the different spectral types , averaged over the entire sample , as a function of radius .",
    "the velocity dispersion is everywhere higher for active systems compared to passive galaxies .",
    "note that the k+a / a+k types exhibit a peak in velocity dispersion that may be related to their distinctive spatial distribution .    unlike the clear difference in the orbital properties of gas - deficient systems in nearby clusters , our sample exhibits ambiguous evidence at best .",
    "the k and e types both have velocity dispersion that falls gently with radius or are , within the errors , flat .",
    "this suggests populations on mildly radial orbits , possibly an infalling population , or a simple isothermal distribution .",
    "more puzzling is the peak in velocity dispersion for the k+a / a+k types , which does appear to be statistically significant .",
    "it is possible , of course , that higher velocities increase the chance of producing a k+a / a+k .",
    "it is also possible that this kinematic feature is connected with their unusual radial distribution , as mentioned above .",
    "a system of largely circular orbits that might characterize this distribution , which is concentrated like the k - types but avoids the core , would appear to have a higher velocity dispersion due to projection of what are largely tangential velocities .",
    "this is , however , not consistent with the idea that such galaxies derive from an infalling population on what are basically radial orbits .",

    "<S> we present spectroscopic observations of galaxies in the fields of 10 distant clusters for which we have previously presented deep imaging with _ wfpc2 _ on board </S>",
    "<S> the _ hubble space telescope_. the clusters span the redshift range @xmath00.56 and are the subject of a detailed ground- and space - based study to investigate the evolution of galaxies as a function of environment and epoch . </S>",
    "<S> the data presented here include positions , photometry , redshifts , spectral line strengths and classifications for 657 galaxies in the fields of the 10 clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the catalog comprises 424 cluster members across the 10 clusters and 233 field galaxies , with detailed morphological information from our _ wfpc2 _ images for 204 of the cluster galaxies and 71 in the field . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate some basic properties of the catalog , including correlations between the morphological and spectral properties of our large sample of cluster galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> a direct comparison of the spectral properties of the high redshift cluster and field populations suggest that the phenomenon of strong balmer lines in otherwise passive galaxies ( commonly called e+a , but renamed here as the k+a class ) shows an order - of - magnitude increase in the rich cluster environment , compared to a more modest increase in the field population . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the process or processes involved in producing k+a galaxies are either substantially more effective in the cluster environment or that this environment prolongs the visibility of this phase . </S>",
    "<S> a more detailed analysis and modeling of these data will be presented in poggianti et al .  </S>",
