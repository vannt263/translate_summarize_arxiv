    "a connection between galaxy - galaxy mergers and the onset of nuclear activity in classical optical and radio - selected active galactic nuclei ( agn ) has been inferred over the last 20 years .",
    "many classical radio galaxies and qsos have been observed at optical and near - infrared wavelengths to have double - nuclei , tidal bridges / tails , and close companions consistent with them being the mergers of disk galaxies ( e.g. stockton & mackenty 1983 ; heckman et al .",
    "1986 ; smith & heckman 1990a , b ; mcleod & rieke 1994 ; surace , sanders & evans 2001 ) . further evidence of the agn - merger connection has resulted from multiwavelength surveys of luminous infrared - selected galaxies , which have shown these galaxies to be merging / interacting disk galaxies and have shown an increasing fraction of infrared galaxies with optical , near - infrared , and x - ray signatures of imbedded agn as a function of increasing luminosity ( e.g. , sanders et al .",

    "in addition , the fraction of classical agn with dust in their host galaxies is substantial ( e.g. , golombek et al .",
    "1988 ; sanders et al 1989 ) , with @xmath6 50% of 3c radio galaxies and @xmath6 70% of palomar - green ( pg : schmidt & green 1983 ) qsos at @xmath13 having iras detections at 60@xmath14 m .",
    "the infrared space observatory ( iso ) detected thermal dust emission in a larger fraction of radio galaxies and qsos ( meisenheimer et al .",
    "2001 ; haas et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 ) , providing further proof of rich isms in the host galaxies of radio galaxies and qsos .",
    "this dust is most likely a combination of dust intrinsic to the progenitor galaxies , as well as dust produced through stellar mass loss from a recent / ongoing starburst .",
    "the importance of star formation in agn host galaxies is also inferred via recent black hole surveys in nearby galaxies .",
    "these observations have shown that the massive spheroidal component of many nearby normal galaxies contain quiescent supermassive nuclear black holes ( @xmath15 m@xmath4 : e.g. magorrian et al .",
    "a key result that has come from these surveys is the scaling of black hole mass with stellar bulge mass ( e.g. , magorrian et al .",
    "such a correlation may indicate that the formation of stars in the bulge component of galaxies is intimately associated with the building of supermassive black holes .",
    "while the molecular gas properties of infrared - selected galaxies have been studied in detail , co observations of large samples of radio galaxies and qsos have lagged behind .",
    "thus , conclusions about the co properties of classical agn and their host galaxies is often based on small number statistics or incomplete data sets .",
    "the present study focusses on the global molecular gas properties of a sample of low - redshift radio galaxies , and it serves as an extension of the survey presented in paper 1 .",
    "the primary issues to be addressed with this survey are _ ( a ) _ whether low-@xmath5 radio - selected agn reside in molecular gas - rich host galaxies and _ ( b ) _ whether the co properties are correlated with the properties of the host galaxy or the agn . to address the latter issue ,",
    "the millimeter data are complemented by infrared , radio , and x - ray data to allow a comparison between the available amount of fuel for star formation ( and perhaps agn activity ) and the energy emitted from the agn and/or host galaxy at these wavelengths .",
    "the analysis presented here builds primarily upon similar analysis done of low - redshift , infrared - selected galaxies over the last twenty years ( e.g. , sanders & mirabel 1996 and references therein ; franceschini et al .",

    "the radio galaxies were selected for co observations based on the following criteria : _ ( i ) _ a declination , @xmath20 , to allow observations from both the kitt peak 12 m telescope and the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) , _ ( ii ) _ _ iras _ flux densities at 60@xmath21 , @xmath22 , or 100@xmath21 , @xmath23 , greater than @xmath24 jy , with the assumption that an _ iras _ detection at this level is a good indicator of a dusty , gas - rich interstellar medium , and _ ( iii ) _ a redshift in the range @xmath25 , to ensure detectability of the molecular gas mass of the milky way ( @xmath12 m@xmath4 ) , if present , with single - dish millimeter telescopes used for the survey ( for the sensitivity calculation , the assumption is made that the co lines have a full width at half the maximum intensity width of @xmath26 km s@xmath1 , which is the average value for a sample of iras galaxies observed by sanders , scoville , & soifer 1991 ) .",
    "such criteria yield 31 radio galaxies .",
    "two additional radio galaxies , pks 0624 - 20 and 3c 285 , were identified via a search of the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) to have properties consistent with the selection criteria ; their addition to the sample raises the total number of galaxies to 33 .",

    "1997 ) and downes & solomon ( 1998 ) have made use of dynamical mass estimates of a low - redshift infrared galaxy sample observed in co with the plateau de bure interferometer to argue that @xmath66 may , in some cases , be as low as 1 @xmath69 ( k km s@xmath1 pc@xmath70 .    for the present sample of galaxies , an @xmath71 ( k km s@xmath1 pc@xmath70 is adopted , which is the approximate value derived for luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( solomon et al .",

    "further , the co disks in 3c 293 ( evans et al .",
    "1999a ) and 3c 31 ( okuda et al .",

    "the present co survey has increased the number of radio galaxies observed in paper 1 by a factor of four .",

    "this result likely indicates that the host galaxies of molecular gas - rich radio galaxies are extremely massive .",
    "the second notable feature is the double - peaked co emission line profiles in many of the spectra .",
    "interferometric co observations of two of these galaxies are in the literature and show this feature to be present for ( at least ) two different reasons . in the case of 3c 293 ,",
    "the `` double - peak '' appearance is caused by a co absorption feature at the systemic velocity of the galaxy ( evans et al .",
    "1999a ) . in the case of 3c 31 ,",
    "the molecular gas is distributed in a ring ( okuda et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "figure 4 shows optical images of 7 of the nine radio galaxies detected in co ; two of the nine radio galaxies ( b2 1318 + 34 and pks 1345 + 12 ) are well - studied systems that have been imaged by several groups ( e.g. sanders et al . 1988b ; bushouse & stanford 1992 ; surace et al .",
    "1998 ; evans et al . 1999b ; scoville et al .",
    "2000 ; kim , veilleux , & sanders 2003 ) , and thus have not been reobserved by us .",
    "most of these molecular gas - rich galaxies have nearby companions ( 3c 31 ; pks 1345 + 12 ) and/or show clear evidence of being involved in a recent merger ( 3c 84 ; 3c 120 ; pks 0502 - 10 ; 3c 293 ; pks 1345 + 12 ; b2 1318 + 34 ) .",
    "the one exception is b2 0722 + 30 , an edge - on spiral galaxy .",
    "while the images in figure 4 support the possibility that interaction and merger events may be a primary trigger for radio - loud agn activity , it is notable that many low - redshift radio galaxies are elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , sandage 1966 ; martel et al .",
    "thus , unless the elliptical galaxies are advanced mergers , other mechanisms must play an important role in igniting the agn activity observed in these galaxies .",
    "given the results of the present survey and recent co surveys of low - redshift pg qsos ( evans et al .",
    "2001 ; scoville 2003 ) , there is sufficient data to begin a comparison of the molecular gas properties and the global energy output ( measured at infrared , radio , and x - ray wavelengths ) of classical uv and radio - selected agn with infrared - selected galaxies and elliptical galaxies . before exploring such comparisons",
    ", it is worth first considering two issues which have direct relevance to the interpretation of the data .",
    "the first issue is the infrared bias in the sample .",
    "while the sample was selected based on the 60@xmath14 m and 100@xmath14 m flux densities , it is important to realize that _ ( a ) _ the flux density limits are extremely low , and thus the infrared luminosity range of the sample spans several decades ( i.e. , @xmath104 l@xmath4 ) , and that _ ( b ) _ 55% , 33% , and 24% of @xmath105 3c , b2 and pks galaxies , respectively , were detected at 60@xmath14 m by iras .",
    "the fraction for pg qsos is even higher , with 69% of pg qsos out to @xmath106 ( the redshift limit of the qso co survey ) having 60@xmath14 m detections .",
    "thus , infrared excesses in agn host galaxies from radio - selected ( and uv - selected ) surveys are quite common .",
    "the second issue of relevance to the interpretation of the data is the nature of the radio emission from the galaxies in the sample ; i.e. , whether the radio emission from all of the galaxies in the sample is due to agn jet emission , or whether some of the galaxies are actually nearby starburst galaxies luminous enough in the radio to have been detected by the 3c , b2 or pks surveys . to address this issue , iras and 1.4 ghz data",
    "have been compiled for the radio galaxies , along with complementary data sets for infrared galaxies with both warm and cool 25-to-60@xmath14 m colors ( note that classical agn typically have warm colors , @xmath107 ) , pg qsos , and elliptical galaxies .",
    "figure 5 shows the result of the compilation ; plotted is the 1.4 ghz - to - infrared luminosity ratio , @xmath108 , versus the infrared luminosity , @xmath109 .",
    "the `` radio - infrared '' correlation ( see condon 1992 ) is clearly visible in this figure ; the radio - to - infrared ratio for infrared - selected galaxies is relatively constant with increasing infrared luminosity .",
    "this has led to speculation that the same population of massive stars responsible for heating the dust is also responsible for the radio emission ( through , for example , the production of supernovae ) .",
    "lonsdale , smith , & lonsdale ( 1995 ) showed that qsos follow the same bolometric luminosity ",
    "radio correlation as infrared galaxies .",
    "similarly , the qsos follow the infrared  radio correlation in figure 5 , indicating , perhaps , that a significant fraction of their radio and infrared emission is associated with massive stars , or that agn - related processes in radio - quiet sources yield the proper @xmath110 ratio to place qsos on the relation . in contrast , the data points for all but one of the radio galaxies are above this correlation ; their excess radio emission is associated with agn jets . only the galaxy b2 1318 + 34 ( aka ic 883 ) , which is classified optically as a liner galaxy , has a @xmath111 ratio consistent with the infrared - radio correlation .",
    "the liner classification is commonly an indication of ionization of an agn with a shallow power law , however , the spatial coincidence between the radio ( condon et al . 1991 ) and co ( downes & solomon 1998 ) emission in the disk of ic 883 is evidence in favor of the radio emission being associated with a starburst population . given this , b2 1318 + 34",
    "will be denoted by a symbol different from the other radio galaxies in figures 6 and 8 .",
    "figure 6 shows two common plots of infrared and co luminosity for extragalactic sources .",
    "the first plot is the co luminosity versus the infrared luminosity of the radio galaxies and pg qsos , plotted with infrared galaxies and elliptical galaxies with co detections . in addition , arrows have been plotted to represent 3@xmath11 @xmath39 upper limits for the radio galaxies with co nondetections in the present survey .",
    "there are two noteworthy features in figure 6a .",
    "first , the pg qso population appear to have low co luminosities for their infrared luminosity relative to infrared galaxies ( see also evans et al .",
    "second , by contrast , the radio galaxies are well distributed throughout the area of the plot occupied by infrared and elliptical galaxies , with the three newly detected radio galaxies ( 3c 31 , pks 0502 - 10 , and 3c 293 ) having high co luminosities for their infrared luminosity .",
    "these features are better represented in figure 6b , which is a plot of the @xmath112 versus the infrared luminosity .",
    "the ratio @xmath113 is commonly referred to as the star formation efficiency , i.e. , it is the measure of energy from massive stars heating the dust normalized by the amount of molecular gas available to form new stars .",
    "thus , for highly efficient starbursts ( i.e. , high @xmath113 ) , a large number of massive stars are produced from the available gas .",
    "the qsos have high @xmath113 , indicating that either they are producing massive stars with extremely high efficiency , or that there is significant heating of the dust by the agn ( evans et al .",
    "most of the radio galaxies have @xmath113 similar to those of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs : sanders & mirabel 1996 ) in the galaxy .",
    "exceptions to this include pks 1345 + 12 , which has a @xmath114 similar to the pg qsos , and the three newly detected radio galaxies , which have @xmath115 ) similar to the global value for local spiral galaxies ( see also evans et al .",
    "1999a ) .",
    "it thus appears that while some radio galaxies have significant amounts of molecular gas , the rate of massive star formation is extremely low .",
    "indeed , if the assumption is made that the infrared luminosity in 3c 31 , pks 0502 - 10 , and 3c 293 is due entirely to star formation , then the star formation rates are roughly a few solar masses per year . note also that the dust temperatures of 3c 31 , pks 0502 - 10 , and 3c 293 are lower ( 3045 k ) than that of the previously detected radio galaxies ( 5590 k ) , also consistent with the idea that current massive star formation rates in these three radio galaxies is low .",
    "given the amount of molecular gas in the radio galaxies detected in co to date , and the diversity in the apparent levels of active star formation ( as traced by @xmath109 and @xmath113 ) , it is worth examining their hard ( 210 kev ) x - ray properties to determine _",
    "( a ) _ whether these radio galaxies have x - ray emission indicative of agn , and _",
    "( b ) _ whether any of the radio galaxies have sufficient column densities of molecular gas to be significantly x - ray absorbed .",
    "the @xmath116-to-@xmath117 ratio provides a straight - forward way of addressing these issues  the ratio is constant in starburst galaxies , indicating that the starburst responsible for heating the dust in hii region galaxies produces a constant fraction of massive x - ray binary pairs ( grimm et al .",
    "2003 ; ranalli et al .",
    "` excesses ' in @xmath116 / @xmath117 arise from the contribution of agn to the x - ray emission , making the ratio a powerful agn vs. starburst diagnostic .",
    "however , in objects that contain large columns of gas and dust , the x - ray emission can be suppressed , lowering the observed @xmath118 .    for the purposes of the present discussion",
    ", the available radio galaxy data of our sample have been compiled from the literature and added to the @xmath116 vs. @xmath117 plot of trentham et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , which is a compilation of data of local liners , seyferts , hii - region galaxies , infrared galaxies , and pg qsos .",
    "the result is plotted in figure 7 ; figure 7a shows the data plotted in the manner typically done by other authors , i.e. , @xmath116 vs. @xmath117 , and figure 7b shows the data plotted in terms of the @xmath119 versus @xmath117 .",
    "a least - squares fit has been applied to the hii region galaxy data .",
    "several of the infrared galaxies , which are rich in molecular gas , are below the fit and thus compton thick . in terms of the radio galaxies data , the figures show that , _ ( a ) _ the agn dominates the x - ray emission from the radio galaxies in a manner consistent with pg qsos and lower luminosity seyferts and liners , and _",
    "( b ) _ the x - ray emission from the agn does not seem to be significantly suppressed , and thus these radio galaxies do not reside in compton - thick environments .",
    "indeed , several of the radio galaxies have measured column densities in the literature  the derived column densities from these x - ray observations are @xmath6 @xmath120 @xmath94 ( leighly et al .",
    "1997 ; sambruna et al . 1999 ; and odea et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "another issue relevant to the present sample of galaxies is whether the molecular gas properties are correlated with the radio output of the radio galaxies .",
    "i.e. , if molecular gas fuels agn activity , there may be a correlation between @xmath39 and the energy emitted by these agn at radio wavelengths .",
    "figure 8a is a plot of @xmath39 versus @xmath121 of the sample of radio galaxies ; comparative samples of infrared galaxies , pg qsos , and ellipticals are also plotted .",
    "the infrared galaxy and pg qso data are correlated , with higher @xmath39 corresponding to higher @xmath108 .",
    "such a correlation can be understood , for example , if a significant fraction of the 1.4 ghz emission is generated via star formation ",
    "the higher the molecular gas content , the higher the number of supernovae generating radio emission .",
    "the radio galaxies occupy a different location on this plot , having high @xmath108 for their @xmath39 relative to infrared galaxies and qsos .",
    "it is also clear from the radio galaxy data that no obvious correlation exists between @xmath108 and @xmath39 .",
    "this result may simply illustrate the fact that , if a correlation between the agn radio output and molecular gas mass exists , it may only exist for the component of the molecular gas in the nuclear region ( near the agn ) , and not the global molecular gas mass measured by these observations .",
    "figure 8b is a plot of @xmath113 versus @xmath121 . in terms of the distribution of infrared galaxies and qso data ,",
    "the plot is reminiscent of figure 6b ",
    "@xmath113 increases with increasing @xmath108 , and the qsos and warm infrared galaxies reside primarily at high @xmath113 and @xmath121 relative to cool infrared galaxies .",
    "the radio galaxies occupy a different location on the plot , having high @xmath108 for their @xmath113 , but no obvious correlation among the radio galaxy data exists .",
    "thus , regardless of whether stars or agn in the host galaxy of these radio galaxies are heating the dust , the fueling efficiency factor @xmath113 is not correlated with the total radio output .",
    "all but one of the radio galaxies detected as part of this survey have molecular gas masses in excess of @xmath122 m@xmath4 , indicating that there are large fuel reservoirs for star formation and possibly agn activity .",
    "the presence of molecular gas , in itself , is not evidence of active star formation .",
    "high mass star formation in the milky way occurs in the cores of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) where the molecular gas densities exceed @xmath123 @xmath124 .",
    "preliminary observations have been done of pks 0502 - 10 and b2 0722 + 30 to provide additional information about the state of the molecular gas .",
    "the first observations are of the co(@xmath30 ) emission line ; the @xmath125 ratios of pks 0502 - 10 and b2 0722 + 30 are 0.6 and 0.7 , respectively .",
    "such low values of @xmath126 are suggestive of subthermally excited co , i.e. , low molecular gas temperatures and densities .",
    "the second set of preliminary observations designed to probe the state of the gas in these radio galaxies are of the high density tracer hcn .",
    "hcn is seen in abundance when the molecular gas densities are on the order of @xmath127 @xmath124 , and thus is found in the cores of gmcs where massive star formation is commencing .",
    "gao & solomon ( 2004 ) have presented an hcn survey of infrared galaxies , and have calculated an average @xmath128 ratio of @xmath129 .",
    "the hcn(@xmath16 ) observations of two radio galaxies yielded only upper limits , translating into @xmath128 lower limits of @xmath6 550 and 3700 for pks 0502 - 10 and b2 0722 + 30 , respectively .",
    "thus , while the @xmath128 of pks 0502 - 10 does not provide a useful constraint , the high @xmath128 of b2 0722 - 30 is suggestive of either highly efficient massive star formation or significant heating of dust by the agn .",
    "one of the goals of this survey was to obtain detections of co emission from radio galaxies of all morphological types .",
    "this survey yielded a co detection in only one fanaroff - riley ii ( edge - brightened radio morphology : fanaroff & riley 1974 ) radio galaxy , 3c 293 .",
    "however , in terms of its radio properties , 3c 293 is not a representative f - r ii .",
    "the galaxy has a low radio power ( @xmath130 w m@xmath131 hz@xmath1 ) relative to the bulk of f - r ii radio galaxies .",
    "in addition , 3c 293 has a complex steep spectrum core which shows evidence of a previous radio outburst ( akujor et al .",
    "1996 ) .    the low co detection rate of f - r ii galaxies ( @xmath6 8% ) relative to f - r i and compact radio source galaxies ( @xmath6 35% ) may be a simple consequence of larger distances of f - r ii galaxies , on average , relative to lower radio power radio galaxies in the sample .",
    "this explanation is unlikely ; figure 6a shows the @xmath39 of the detected radio galaxies and the @xmath39 upper limits of the undetected galaxies .",
    "the upper limits of all of the non - detected f - r ii galaxies are below @xmath132 k km s@xmath1 pc@xmath41 , and three out of seven ( excluding b2 1318 + 34 ) of the co - detected f - r i and compact radio galaxies are above this line . thus ,",
    "though the f - r ii galaxies comprise 36% of the sample , there are no additional f - r ii galaxies in the sample with molecular gas masses comparable to either 3c 293 , or the most gas - rich f - r i and radio compact galaxies ( pks 0502 - 10 , txs 1506 + 345 , and pks 1345 + 12 ) in the sample .",
    "this result , of course , relies on the assumption that f - r ii radio galaxies have co emission line widths of @xmath133 km s@xmath1 ; if the line widths are sufficiently broad , then the limited velocity bandwidth ( i.e. , @xmath6 1400 km s@xmath1 at 3 mm ) available with single - dish telescopes such as the 12 m telescope would make the co detections difficult .",
    "the present co survey has focussed on a sample of iras - detected radio galaxies using a fairly moderate size single - dish millimeter telescope .",
    "the results presented here can be improved upon in the following ways : _ ( i )",
    "_ co surveys of larger samples of iso and spitzer space telescope - detected radio galaxies using larger single - dish millimeter - wave telescopes or interferometers .",
    "_ ( ii ) _ volume - limited co surveys of radio galaxies ( and qsos ) similar to those initiated by lim et al .",

    "1996 ; evans et al .",
    "1999a , b ; okuda et al .",
    "2005 ; evans et al .",
    "finally , continued investigations of star formation in radio galaxies using diagnostics at multiple wavelengths will provide a more complete picture of the putative starburst - agn connection .",
    "recent optical spectroscopy of three of the galaxies in the sample ( 3c 293 , 3c 305 , and pks 1345 + 12 : tadhunter et al .",
    "2005 ) have provided encouraging results .",
    "the survey presented here is a follow - up to the mazzarella et al .",
    "( 1993 ) study of iras - detected radio galaxies , which yielded new co detections in three radio galaxies .",
    "the survey has increased the number of low - redshift radio galaxies observed in the prior survey by a factor of four .",
    "the following conclusions have been reached :    \\(1 ) three additional radio galaxies ( 3c 31 , pks 0502 - 10 , 3c 293 ) have been detected in co(@xmath16 ) , yielding a total of 9 detections out of 33 radio galaxies .",
    "the co detections translate into molecular gas masses of @xmath96 m@xmath4 , with 3@xmath11 upper limits for nondetections in the range of @xmath97 m@xmath4 for a @xmath134 galaxy to @xmath99 m@xmath4 for a @xmath100 galaxy ( @xmath66 = 1.5 @xmath69 [ k km s@xmath1 pc@xmath68^{-1}$ ] .",
    "thus , the upper limits of the more distant members of the sample do not rule out molecular gas mass as high as that of the milky way ( @xmath12 m@xmath4 ) .",

    "<S> the iras flux - limited sample contains 33 radio galaxies with different radio morphologies and a broad range of infrared luminosities ( @xmath3 l@xmath4 ) , allowing for an investigation of _ ( a ) _ whether low-@xmath5 radio - selected agn reside in molecular gas - rich host galaxes , and _ </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) _ whether the co properties are correlated with the properties of the host galaxy or the agn . </S>",
    "<S> all of the radio galaxies in mazzarella et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1993 ) and mirabel et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1989 ) have been reobserved . </S>",
    "<S> three new co detections have been made , raising the total number of co detections to nine and setting the survey detection rate at @xmath6 25% . </S>",
    "<S> many of the co lines have double - peaked profiles , and the co line widths are broad ( average @xmath7 km s@xmath1 ) , exceeding the average co widths of both ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( @xmath8 km s@xmath1 ) and palomar - green qsos ( @xmath9 km s@xmath1 ) , and thus being indicative of massive host galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the co luminosities translate into molecular gas masses of @xmath10 m@xmath4 , however , the 3@xmath11 co upper limits for nondetections do not rule out a molecular gas mass as high as that of the milky way ( @xmath12 m@xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> optical images of eight out of nine molecular gas - rich radio galaxies show evidence of close companions and/or tidal features . </S>",
    "<S> finally , there is no obvious correlation between radio power and molecular gas mass . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is notable that only one f - r ii galaxy out of 12 is detected in this co survey ; the remaining detections are of galaxies hosting f - r i and compact radio jets . </S>"
