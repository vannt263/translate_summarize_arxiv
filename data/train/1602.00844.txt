    "in the design and analysis of wireless communication networks , the signal - to - interference ratio ( sir ) , defined in the next section , is a key quantity . in this paper , we consider the probability distribution of the sir in the spatial stochastic models of downlink cellular networks , where the wireless base stations ( bss ) are deployed according to spatial point processes on the euclidian plane ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the sir distribution in these cellular network models can be provided as a closed - form or a numerically computable form for some restricted cases such as the bss are deployed according to homogeneous poisson point processes or kinds of determinantal point processes with specific propagation effects of fading and shadowing ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , such special cases can not always represent the actual bs deployments and propagation effects in the real cellular networks , so that some approximation and/or asymptotic approaches have been proposed to cope with more general models ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the current paper",
    ", we focus on the tail asymptotics of the sir distribution in the single - tier network models , where the bss are deployed according to general stationary point processes with general propagation effects .",
    "recently , ganti & haenggi  @xcite consider the same general cellular network models and investigate the asymptotics of the sir distribution both at the origin and at infinity . in",
    "@xcite , they derive the tail asymptotic result which is just our concern , but they do not mention any conditions under which the result holds . in their proof ,",
    "a technique of changing the order of the limit and integrals is used , which generally requires a kind of uniform integrability condition .",
    "this paper then compensates @xcite for the lack of the uniform integrability condition and exposes a sufficient condition for the order change of the limit and integrals .",
    "we further give some examples satisfying such a sufficient condition as well as a counterexample violating it .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : first , we describe the spatial stochastic model of single - tier downlink cellular networks and define the sir for the typical user in the next section .",
    "section [ sec : asymptotic_result ] states the main result , where we give a sufficient condition under which the tail asymptotics of the sir distribution is properly obtained . in section  [ sec : examples ] , we illustrate some examples satisfying the condition and indicate the asymptotic results for the corresponding models of the examples .",
    "we further give a simple counterexample violating the sufficient condition .",
    "let @xmath0 denote a point process on @xmath1 , which is assumed to be ordered such that @xmath2 .",
    "each point  @xmath3 , @xmath4 , represents the location of a bs of the cellular network and we refer to the bs located at @xmath3 as bs  @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that the point process  @xmath6 is simple and locally finite almost surely in @xmath7 ( @xmath7-a.s . ) and also stationary with intensity  @xmath8 .",
    "assuming further that all bss transmit at the same power level and each user is associated with the nearest bs , we focus on a typical user located at the origin  @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 , @xmath4 , denote the random propagation effect representing the fading and shadowing from bs  @xmath5 to the typical user , where @xmath10 , @xmath4 , are mutually independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) , and independent of the point process  @xmath6 as well .",
    "the path - loss function representing the attenuation of signals with distance is given by @xmath11 , @xmath12 , for @xmath13 .",
    "the downlink sir for the typical user is then given by @xmath14 where we should recall that @xmath15 is the nearest point of @xmath6 from the origin .",
