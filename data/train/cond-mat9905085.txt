    "various theoretical methods have been developed to study optical properties of semiconductors @xcite .",
    "these methods can be divided into two groups ; a `` fermionic method '' and a `` bosonic method '' .",
    "the fermionic method @xcite is formulated on the hilbert space of two fermionic species , i.e. , photo - excited electrons and holes in semiconductors . in this method , one solves the coupled equations of motions , the semiconductor bloch equations ( sbe ) @xcite , for the particle densities of electrons and of holes , and for the expectation value of the polarization of the system . since",
    "this method basically relies on the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation for electrons and holes , it is suitable for higher excitation density , where coulombic screening effects guarantee that exciton correlation effects become less crucial .",
    "in order to extend this method to lower excitation density , where exciton correlations become important , the three- and four - particle correlations should be taken into account and the truncation scheme should be improved .    on the other hand ,",
    "the bosonic method @xcite is based on excitons , bound states of an electron and a hole . regarding this elementary excitation as a bosonic particle ,",
    "one constructs an effective hamiltonian of bosonic excitons , from which physical quantities , such as linear and non - linear response functions , can be calculated . here",
    ", the effective hamiltonian should be constructed very carefully , as we will show in this paper .",
    "the bosonic method is believed to be valid when the optical excitation is weak and when the photon energy is close to the exciton energy ( see section [ conditions ] ) , because under these conditions main contributions to the optical properties should come from the excitons created in the system . with increasing the photo - excitation intensity , the coulombic force becomes weaker by increased screening and/or increased fermi energy , and the contribution from free carriers becomes more important .",
    "hence , the bosonic method is not valid at high excitation intensity .",
    "a remarkable feature of the light field as a probing tool of materials is that it has the polarization degrees of freedom .",
    "recent experimental studies of semiconductor optics make the best use of this fact to reveal more detailed properties of excited states .",
    "the polarization degrees of freedom of photons induce `` spin '' degrees of freedom of excitations ( see below ) .",
    "experiments , including the four - wave mixing experiment in the time - domain , have revealed the crucial roles of the interaction between an exciton ( or an @xmath2 pair ) created by the left - circularly polarized light and the one created by the right - circularly polarized light@xcite .",
    "however , most of the existing theories could not treat the polarization dependence correctly .",
    "for example , since the sbe ( in its original form ) were discussed within hf theory @xcite , the excitations with different polarization degrees of freedom ( e.g. , left and right ) are completely decoupled .",
    "hence it is impossible to explain the polarization dependence of the optical response .",
    "it is the case with bosonic theories . in most cases ,",
    "the polarization degrees of freedom were not included in the theories for simplicity .",
    "although it has been asserted that including such degrees of freedom should be trivial @xcite , the excitons with opposite spins are completely decoupled .",
    "this is because they essentially end up with hf of @xmath0 excitons .",
    "this means that to discuss polarization dependence in bosonic theories is non trivial .    in this paper",
    ", we show that it is not at all trivial to derive the interaction of excitons created by opposite polarized light in a bosonic theory .",
    "one crucial result is that to go beyond the hf approximation of @xmath0 excitons becomes of paramount importance .",
    "one of such investigations is seen in ref.@xcite , where the modification of exciton binding energy is discussed .",
    "up to now , a strong objection against the bosonic method was that excitons are not bosonic particles .",
    "moreover , until recently there were almost no experimental evidence which verifies an effective bosonic theory both qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "however , important experimental evidence for the validity of the boson picture has been reported recently in a two - dimensional system @xcite .",
    "the experiment , discussed in detail below , is a non - linear version of normal mode coupling in a high - q micro cavity .",
    "this experiment was stimulated by the fact that optical responses from semiconductors that are strongly coupled to the photon field have received much attention in recent years .",
    "the strong coupling is obtained by confining optically active regions in a high - q micro cavity , which is made possible by the development of nano - structure technology . for linear optical responses ,",
    "the most noticeable phenomenon is a large rabi - splitting , which has been observed in both inorganic @xcite and organic@xcite semiconductors ( insulators ) .",
    "kuwata - gonokami _ et al .",
    "_ have performed four - wave mixing in a gaas quantum well ( qw ) that is strongly coupled to the radiation field in a high - q micro cavity@xcite .",
    "they investigated several polarization configurations under the condition that the excitation density is very low , and measured the polariton - polariton scattering signals .",
    "the experimental results were successfully reproduced by a phenomenological model , which is called the weakly interacting boson model ( wibm)@xcite . in the wibm , excitons are treated as interacting bosons . the good agreement with the experimental results demonstrated that the bosonic picture is reliable in the lower - excitation regime .",
    "the hamiltonian of the wibm is @xmath3    \\nonumber\\\\ & & + w\\sum_{{\\bf k}_{1},{\\bf k}_{2},{\\bf k}_{3 } } b^{\\dagger}_{{\\bf k}_{1}\\,+}b^{\\phantom{\\dagger}}_{{\\bf k}_{2}\\,+ }   b^{\\dagger}_{{\\bf k}_{3}\\,-}b^{\\phantom{\\dagger}}_{{\\bf k}_{1}-{\\bf k}_{2}+{\\bf k}_{3}\\,- } \\nonumber\\\\ & & + r\\sum_{{\\bf k}_{1},{\\bf k}_{2},{\\bf k}_{3},\\sigma } b^{\\dagger}_{{\\bf k}_{1}\\,\\sigma } b^{\\dagger}_{{\\bf k}_{2}\\,\\sigma } b^{\\phantom{\\dagger}}_{{\\bf k}_{3}\\,\\sigma } b^{\\phantom{\\dagger}}_{{\\bf k}_{1}-{\\bf k}_{2}+{\\bf k}_{3}\\,\\sigma } \\nonumber\\\\ & & -g\\nu\\sum_{{\\bf k}_{1},{\\bf k}_{2},{\\bf k}_{3},\\sigma } \\left ( b^{\\dagger}_{{\\bf k}_{1}\\,\\sigma } b^{\\phantom{\\dagger}}_{{\\bf k}_{2}\\,\\sigma } a^{\\dagger}_{{\\bf k}_{3}\\,\\sigma } b^{\\phantom{\\dagger}}_{{\\bf",

    "b^{\\phantom{\\dagger}}_{{\\bf k}_{1}-{\\bf k}_{2}+{\\bf k}_{3}\\,\\sigma }   \\right ) , \\label{wibm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where photons and excitons are described by boson operators , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , with the spin index @xmath6 .",
    "this hamiltonian has three parameters : @xmath7 is the interaction strength of the excitons with opposite spin , @xmath8 is the interaction strength of the excitons with the same spin , and @xmath9 is the filling factor @xcite .",
    "the ratio of these three parameters was measured as @xmath10 .",
    "once these three parameters are fixed , the experimental results for all polarization configurations are fitted very well .",
    "this indicates that a bosonic method is quite reliable in the lower excitation density .",
    "nevertheless , existing bosonic theories @xcite can not give a _ microscopic _ foundation of the wibm .",
    "the purpose of our paper is to derive an effective boson hamiltonian of @xmath0 excitons with `` spin '' degrees of freedom under the three conditions cited in sec.[conditions ] . through this derivation , a microscopic foundation of the wibm ,",
    "especially the interaction terms of excitons with the scattering strength @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the wibm , is obtained .",
    "we show that effects of exciton states higher than @xmath0 are crucial when deriving the effective hamiltonian of @xmath0 excitons @xcite : these effects yield the two - body interaction term corresponding to @xmath7 in eq.([wibm ] ) , and largely modify the strength of the interaction term corresponding to @xmath8 in eq.([wibm ] ) .",
    "the higher exciton states are taken into account through a projection procedure , and , as shown in sec.[necessity ] , it is crucial to project the whole exciton space onto the @xmath0 excitons subspace and to re - construct of the interaction of @xmath0 excitons .    in a more general sense ,",
    "the bosonic description of fermionic systems in two - dimension is one of the most attractive fields in condensed matter theory @xcite .",
    "if the bosonic method is useful in two - dimensional semiconductors , it would be one of the examples of the success of a two - dimensional `` bosonization '' .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in sec.ii , after explaining the necessity of the projection , exciton bosonic operators are introduced and exciton spins are defined . in sec.iii ,",
    "the exciton interaction is discussed without the projection , which corresponds to the two - dimensional case of the existing bosonic theory @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the exciton interaction corresponding to the @xmath7 term in wibm is _ not _ obtained in this approximation . in sec.iv , which is the main part of this paper , the projection procedure",
    "is introduced @xcite , resulting in appearance of the @xmath7 term and modifications of the interaction strength of excitons with the same spins .",
    "discussions and remarks are presented in sec.v . in sec.vi ,",
    "the results obtained in this paper are summarized . throughout this paper , the units @xmath11 are used .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to derive an _ effective _ hamiltonian of @xmath0 excitons in a qw . here",
    ", the `` effective hamiltonian '' means that it ( approximately ) describes the optical responses of the qw correctly , although it is a function of @xmath0 exciton operators only .",
    "since any effective theory is valid only in some specific physical situations , we first clarify the physical situations or conditions under which we construct the effective theory . in compensation for this limitation ,",
    "the effective theory is quite useful ; it gives deep insights by describing the physics simply .",
    "in contrast , such insights are hardly obtainable from straightforward calculations using the electron - hole hamiltonian .",
    "we construct an effective hamiltonian that describes optical responses of semiconductor qws under the following conditions : ( i ) the excitation is weak ( weak excitation regime ) so that the mean distance @xmath12 of photo - created ( virtual and/or real ) excitons is much larger than the bohr radius @xmath13 of the @xmath0 exciton ; @xmath14 and ( ii ) all the photon energies ( pump , probe , and signal ) @xmath15 are close to the energy @xmath16 of the @xmath0 exciton ; @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the energy of @xmath19 excitons , and ( iii ) the line width @xmath20 of @xmath0 exciton is smaller than the detuning energies ; @xmath21 physical meaning of these conditions will be explained in section [ sec_validity ] .    under these conditions ,",
    "nonlinear optical signals would not be strong in general .",
    "one must therefore devise experimental methods for detecting the signals with a high sensitivity .",
    "for this purpose , a genius method was proposed by kuwata - gonokami _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , in which an optical cavity with a high q value is utilized .",
    "this point will be discussed later in sec.[sec_validity ] .",
    "the hamiltonian of an @xmath2 system is defined on the @xmath2 hilbert space @xmath22 that is an fermionic hilbert space spanned by @xmath23 and @xmath24 states .",
    "as long as photo excitations are concerned , all excited states are charge neutral .",
    "we can thus limit ourselves in the charge neutral sector of @xmath22 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian of excitons , which is defined on a bosonic hilbert space spanned by the exciton states , should describe the dynamics of the @xmath2 system in this charge neutral sector of @xmath22 .",
    "note that there are two ( or more ) choices for the bosonic hilbert space : one is the whole exciton space @xmath25 that is spanned by all exciton states , whereas the other is its subspace @xmath26 that is spanned by the @xmath0 states only .",
    "the effective hamiltonian depends on the choice of the bosonic hilbert space .",
    "we will first consider in sec.[before ] the effective hamiltonian defined on @xmath25 .",
    "its interaction part takes the following form : @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the excitonic boson operators ( defined later ) , and @xmath29 is the area of the qw .",
    "the first term denotes the two - body interactions between excitons of various states , and @xmath30 denotes three- and more- body interactions . since _ exact _ calculations , which take account of _ all _ terms of eq.([generalh ] ) to infinite order , are impossible , _",
    "one has to make approximations_. because of conditions ( i)-(iii ) of sec.[conditions ] , it is tempting to take only the two - body interactions of @xmath0 excitons , @xmath31 , among many terms of eq.([generalh ] ) ; @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes @xmath34 with @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , however , we will show later that the replacement @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath31 is a very poor approximation , which can not explain the experimental results _ even qualitatively_. this originates from the complete neglect of effects of higher exciton states @xmath38 , which , however , play important roles as intermediate states .    to resolve this difficulty , we will then consider in sec .",
    "[ projection ] the effective hamiltonian defined on @xmath26 .",
    "it is obtained by the projection procedure , by which the dynamics in @xmath25 is projected onto the subspace @xmath26 that is spanned by @xmath0 excitons only .",
    "in general , a projection procedure generates dissipative terms in the projected dynamics in the subspace . under conditions ( i)-(iii ) of sec.[conditions ] , however , we may neglect the dissipative terms .",
    "namely , the dynamics in @xmath26 can be described by an hamiltonian dynamics , whose hamiltonian ( effective hamiltonian ) is a function of the boson operators @xmath33 for @xmath0 excitons only .",
    "its interaction part , @xmath39 , consists of two- and more - body interactions among @xmath0 excitons .",
    "for example , the two - body interaction @xmath40 takes the following form ; @xmath41 in this two - body interaction , effects of higher exciton states have been ( partly ) included as `` renormalization effects '' , which have modified ( renormalized ) the forms and the strengths of @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , in contrast to the case of @xmath42 , it is reasonable to take @xmath40 as an approximation to @xmath39 .",
    "in fact , we will show that the replacement @xmath39",
    "@xmath37 @xmath40 is a good approximation , which agrees with the wibm and experimental results . in short",
    ", one must perform the projection onto the subspace @xmath26 to get a correct effective interaction of @xmath0 excitons .",
    "the projection procedure modifies both the form and strengths of the effective interaction .",
    "this is essential to justify the wibm . in what follows",
    ", we will derive the effective interaction @xmath40 of @xmath0 excitons in a qw from the conventional interacting electron - hole hamiltonian .",
    "we consider the conduction and the heavy - hole bands in a gaas qw , which has a direct band gap .",
    "we start from the following conventional form of the electron - hole hamiltonian @xmath1 : @xmath43 here , @xmath44 denotes the coulomb potential , which behaves in a qw of width @xmath45 as @xmath46 for @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the static dielectric constant , and @xmath49 constant for @xmath50 .",
    "the calculation is simplified by taking the limit @xmath51 wherever the singularity at @xmath52 is irrelevant . in eq .",
    "( [ heh ] ) , @xmath53 is the field operator of an electron ( hole ) , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and similarly for @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the index @xmath60 denotes the @xmath61-component of the total angular momentum , which is a good quantum number , when the @xmath61-axis is taken in the direction normal to the qw layers .",
    "the @xmath62 is defined as @xmath63 times @xmath64 of the corresponding valence band electron . in a gaas",
    "qw , @xmath65 for a heavy hole , and @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "a photon with @xmath67 creates an electron - hole pair with @xmath68 and @xmath69 to conserve the total angular momentum .",
    "since all states that are excited by photons are electrically neutral , the discussion is confined to the charge - neutral sector .",
    "then the following exciton operator can be defined @xcite : @xmath70 here , the plane wave corresponds to the center - of - mass motion of an electron - hole pair , @xmath71 is a wavefunction for the _ e - h _ relative motion , @xmath72 the clebsch - gordan ( cg ) coefficient , @xmath29 the qw area , and @xmath73 . in the following , the heavy hole condition @xmath74 is assumed , and @xmath75 .    from the explicit calculation of the commutation relation for these operators ,",
    "they can be treated as bosonic operators when the particle density is very low .",
    "this is satisfied under condition ( i ) of section [ conditions ] .",
    "when @xmath71 is the wave function with the quantum number @xmath76 ) of a hydrogen atom in two - dimension @xcite , the operator @xmath77 is identified with the bosonic operator for an exciton with the relative motion index @xmath9 .",
    "then , the exciton states are labelled by indices @xmath78 , @xmath9 and @xmath79 , where @xmath78 is the momentum of the center - of - mass motion , @xmath9 denotes the set of quantum numbers for the relative motion @xmath9 , and @xmath79 denotes combinations of @xmath80 and @xmath62 , as shown in eqs.([cg - tbl2 ] ) and ( [ cg - tbl1 ] ) . since @xmath79 is related to the total angular momentum , it is referred to as `` spin '' index in the following . for transitions from the heavy - hole band to the electron band in a gaas qw , possible changes of the total angular momentum are @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",

    "they are related with @xmath85 as @xmath86 which should be compared with eq.([cg - tbl1 ] ) of semiconductors with different band structures . since the dipole transition is associated with @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 are dipole active , coupling to circularly polarized light with @xmath90 , whereas @xmath91 and @xmath92 are dipole inactive .",
    "the general form of eq.([cg - tbl2 ] ) for elliptically polarized light is discussed in ref.@xcite .",

    "( [ r ] ) and ( [ w ] ) , we find that this ratio is reproduced by the present theory when the cutoff parameter @xmath213 , which is consistent with the requirement that @xmath206 is of the order of unity .",
    "considering that the values of @xmath8 and @xmath7 vary slightly from sample to sample @xcite , the agreement seems satisfactory .",

    "that is , lowest - order perturbative calculations for the polariton - polariton scattering amplitudes agree with the experiment @xcite . from the above discussion , we conclude that the present theory yields the microscopic background of the two exciton interaction terms in the wibm .",
    "the correct form of the effective hamiltonian of @xmath0 excitons is the renormalized one instead of the hamiltonian which is obtained without the projection procedure , i.e. , @xmath215 in fact , the opposite spin exciton interaction in @xmath191 , which is absent in @xmath216 , has been clearly observed experimentally in refs .",
    "we have used a low - order perturbation theory to derive @xmath192 , where successive scatterings in the intermediate processes are not considered . however , this does not imply a total neglect of multi scattering processes , because we have calculated a hamiltonian rather than observables .",
    "in fact , a systematic summing up of higher order scattering processes is incorporated in our theory if one calculates higher - order perturbation terms from @xmath192 by writing down the bethe - salpeter equation .",

    "the stability of the system should be preserved by higher order terms . in general situations , properties of a system described by such a hamiltonian",
    "should not be analyzed by a perturbation theory based on the vacuum of the free part .",
    "nevertheless , we can use such a perturbation theory in our case , because our exciton theory has the built - in constraint that the ground state is the state with no excitons , i.e. , the vacuum of @xmath175 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian @xmath217 together with this constraint constitutes a consistent theory , which justifies the low - order perturbation theory based on the given vacuum , if the optical excitation is sufficiently weak .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , most of the existing bosonic theories treated spinless excitons and argued that the effect of spins is obtained by trivial extension of the spinless theory @xcite .",
    "the result of such theories is that excitons interact repulsively .",
    "the interaction of excitons with opposite spins then is attributed to the biexciton formation .",
    "however , an explicit expression of an interaction hamiltonian of @xmath0 excitons with opposite spins was not obtained @xcite .",
    "this is quite natural because the conventional method was discussed in the hf approximation of @xmath0 excitons only , where higher exciton states were completely ignored .",
    "such a theory will not yield the interaction of excitons with opposite spins , as shown in this paper .",
    "the projection method discussed in this paper proves that one can obtain the explicit form of the interaction hamiltonian of excitons with opposite spins beyond hf approximation of only @xmath0 excitons .",
    "there are several papers where such an approach is motivated @xcite ; however , only the modification of the exciton binding energy is discussed . using our interaction hamiltonian , one can reproduce these results @xcite .",
    "several authors obtain an interaction between @xmath145 and @xmath146 excitons within the hf approximation of only @xmath0 excitons @xcite . in those approaches ,",
    "exciton operators do not have a spin coordinate , and the exchange interaction is not the correct one in the sense that the spin coordinate is not exchanged because of the absence of such a coordinate .",
    "from this theory , the interaction strength of the excitons with opposite spins is @xmath63 times the one with the identical spins .",
    "the absence of the opposite spin exciton interaction within hf of only @xmath0 excitons is confirmed in many papers @xcite .",
    "in deriving the effective hamiltonian of @xmath0 excitons , we have assumed three conditions listed in sec.[conditions ] : ( i ) the excitation is weak so that the mean distance of photo - created excitons is much larger than the bohr radius of the @xmath0 exciton , and ( ii ) all the photon energies ( pump , probe , and signal ) are close to the energy of the @xmath0 exciton , and ( iii ) the line width of @xmath0 exciton is smaller than the detuning energies .",
    "the condition ( i ) allows us to use the boson representation of excitons .",
    "this condition may be confirmed experimentally by the fact that the signal intensity is precisely proportional to the square of the pump intensity , i.e. , the optical response is well described by @xmath218 .",
    "this suggests that the two - body scattering processes would be dominant .",
    "when @xmath12 is increased to @xmath219 , the deviation from the boson statistics of the operators @xmath77 and @xmath220 will become non - negligible , which invalidates the boson representation @xcite .",
    "the condition ( ii ) means that the @xmath0 excitons give dominant contributions .",
    "this allows us to project out all states higher than @xmath0 .",
    "the final condition ( iii ) allows us to neglect relaxation process of @xmath0 excitons .",
    "namely , the equation of motion of the reduced density operator @xmath221 in the @xmath0 exciton subspace generally takes the following form ; @xmath222 + \\tilde\\gamma \\tilde\\rho_{1s}.\\ ] ] here , @xmath217 describes the unitary evolution of @xmath221 , and @xmath223 is the relaxation operator , which is described by the imaginary part of a vertex correction .",
    "since the relaxation processes are less crucial under the condition ( iii ) , one may disregard @xmath223 , i.e. , one may consider only the real part of the vertex correction .",
    "one might think that under these conditions the optical signals would not be strong enough to obtain experimental data . however , kuwata - gonokami _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a genius method to overcome this difficulty : they confined a gaas qw in a high - q optical cavity .",
    "this results in a large splitting of excitonic polariton spectrum .",
    "some nonlinear optical signals are strongest at the polariton energies ( upper and lower ones ) because of the polariton resonance . on the other hand ,",
    "the dissipation ( which creates real excitons in the qw ) is weak at these energies .",
    "[ this may be understood by considering possible final states : when the initial state is a single photon state ( coming from an external light source ) that has the energy of the lower - polariton peak , the final state can not be an exciton state ( without a photon ) because the energy is short to create a real exciton .",
    "] therefore , one can obtain strong signals without significant dissipation when the photon energies are close to the polariton energies in a high - q optical cavity .",
    "using this idea , kuwata - gonokami _ et al . _",
    "@xcite measured nonlinear optical responses under the conditions ( i)-(iii ) , and showed the validity of the wibm .",
    "our theory is valid in such a case .    on the other hand , shirane _ et al .",
    "_ recently demonstrated that the dissipation becomes important when the q value of the optical cavity is lowered @xcite .",
    "in this case the relaxation processes of @xmath0 exciton becomes important , which means that @xmath224 must be fully considered .",
    "these are closely related to the excitation induced relaxation ( eid ) discussed below .",
    "the relaxation effect is one of the future problems .",
    "another example to which the present theory is applicable may be the optical stark effect in high - quality samples at low temperature . in the past experiments of the optical stark effect , one had to take the detuning rather large ( hence , condition ( ii ) is not satisfied ) in order to avoid the absorption tail .",
    "the absorption tail would be reduced for samples with better quality and at lower temperatures .",
    "it has been conjectured @xcite that a `` biexciton effect '' would be the origin of the `` _ w _ term '' , i.e. , the opposite spin exciton interaction .",
    "however , this argument is misleading .",
    "the biexciton state is analogous to a hydrogen molecule and is formed essentially through the mixing of two @xmath0 states having different centers .",
    "the mixing of two hydrogen atoms yields the bonding and antibonding states , which are represented as @xmath225 .",
    "here , @xmath226 creates an electron in the @xmath0 state located at nucleus 1(2 ) , and @xmath227 creates the nucleus .",

    "the corresponding states are @xmath229|0\\rangle $ ] , where the @xmath230-dependence is omitted in order to focus on the @xmath79-dependence .",
    "the bonding state ( @xmath231 sign for a positive coupling constant ) has a lower energy and is called biexciton .",
    "this energy splitting between the bonding and antibonding states is induced by an interaction of the form of @xmath232 , which is included in @xmath233 ( or , before the renormalization , in @xmath133 of eq .",
    "( [ hex ] ) ) . from a more general point of view , a typical bound state in an interacting boson model is the eigenstate @xmath234 of a boson hamiltonian in the following form : @xmath235 the eigenenergy of @xmath236 is @xmath237 . note that the existence of the bound state is independent of the sign of the interaction @xmath238 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath7 term lowers the energies of _ both _ states _ by the same amount _ , hence does not play a central role in the formation of the biexciton state .",
    "the most important effect of the @xmath7 term is to lower the energy of @xmath239 , relative to those of @xmath240 and @xmath241 , and this effect was detected experimentally @xcite . in the framework of the present bosonic theory , @xmath233 lowers the energy of the bonding ( biexciton ) state relative to that of the antibonding state , and thus is crucial for the formation of the biexciton state , whereas the @xmath242 term lowers the energy of both bonding and antibonding states .",
    "the original sbe are a theory within hf .",
    "there are two reasons that an extension beyond hf approximation becomes necessary .",
    "one reason is that it is necessary to take exciton - exciton correlation effects into account .",
    "when the excitation is low , the optical response from semiconductors are attributed to excitons .",
    "similar features appear under high magnetic fields @xcite , where the most striking feature is that the signal of time - domain four - wave mixing does not decay exponentially , whereas the sbe predict a single - exponential decay .",
    "these typical two cases are beyond the scope of sbe .    as for the spin degrees of freedom ,",
    "the excitations created by photons with the opposite circularly polarization are completely decoupled within hf .",
    "furthermore , the experimental results of the polarization dependence of four - wave mixing signals and quantum beats are not treated within hf .",
    "the coupling of the excitation with the opposite spin is obtained beyond hf approximation .",
    "finally , we discuss the relation between the fermionic theories @xcite and the present bosonic theory .",
    "the hf factorization treatment of the sbe @xcite can not produce the interaction between the excitation created by right - circularly polarized light and the excitation by left - circularly polarized light .",
    "the hf theory , therefore , corresponds to @xmath131 , eq .",
    "( [ hexpm ] ) .",
    "it was argued in refs .",
    "@xcite that the interactions of an exciton with higher states ( including free carriers ) are important , and that the interactions result in the energy shift , the eid , and the `` biexcitonic correlations '' . in the bosonic theory in the form of eq .",
    "( [ hx ] ) , these effects are included in @xmath133 and @xmath130 .",
    "after the projection is made , the relation is roughly as follows .",
    "the renormalized hamiltonian @xmath176 , eq .",
    "( [ tildehexpm ] ) , would include the hf term .",
    "the eid may be described by both @xmath223 and @xmath190 .",
    "the `` biexcitonic correlation '' would be included in @xmath190 .",
    "we believe that the present theory thus helps to bridge the gap between the bosonic theories @xcite and the fermionic theories @xcite of _ e - h _ systems . however , more detailed comparisons will be a subject of future studies .",
    "as another future problem , the microscopic expression of the filling factor @xmath9 should be discussed on the same footing .",
    "although such an expression was derived in @xcite , it corresponds to the `` before projection '' in our theory , so that the corresponding term `` after projection '' remains a subject of future research .",
    "in this paper , we have derived the effective hamiltonian for @xmath0 excitons with spin degree of freedom in two - dimension .",
    "this theory is valid when excitation density is weak and when the photon energy is close to the @xmath0 exciton energy , because the boson operators of @xmath0 excitons are used .",
    "relaxation processes of excitons should be less important like , e.g. , a qw in micro cavity with high - q value .",
    "what should be most emphasized is that the projection is crucial to obtain the effective hamiltonian of excitons : the correct effective hamiltonian of @xmath0 excitons is not the one which is obtained by discarding the all exciton operators of @xmath243 among the full interaction of excitons ( see eqs.([generalh ] ) and ( [ generalhs ] ) ) , because it can not explain the experimental results even qualitatively , as discussed in sec.[before ] .",
    "the higher exciton states @xmath244 play important roles as intermediate states . in order to include such effects ,",
    "the projection is used . through this procedure ,",
    "the interactions of excitons with the opposite spins are obtained and the interaction strength of excitons with the same spins is drastically modified ( renormalized ) as shown in sec.[projection ] . in short , the procedure renormalizes both the form and strength of the effective interaction .",
    "it is also shown that the effective hamiltonian obtained through the projection provides the microscopic foundation of the phenomenological hamiltonian , @xmath245 , proposed in @xcite .",
    "the agreement of the present theory with experiments supports the validity of a description of a fermionic system by bosonic fields in two - dimension , if the excitation is weak .",

    "we have obtained the opposite spin exciton interaction within the projection procedure for exciton boson operator including electron and hole spin indices . the two hilbert spaces spanned by the excitons corresponding to left - circularly and right - circularly polarized photons are completely orthogonal .",
    "one might think that this decoupling is due to the spin configuration @xmath66 and @xmath65 of the electron and heavy - hole bands in gaas .",
    "this is , however , not the case : we show that for a different band structure with @xmath246-type electron and hole bands ( @xmath247 ) , excitons with @xmath132 are also decoupled before the projection .",
