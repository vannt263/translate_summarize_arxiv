    "large spatial density fluctuations in high - energy heavy - ion collisions can come from many sources .",
    "some of these sources are expected to be quite common in high - energy heavy - ion collisions and consequently large scale density fluctuations may often occur .",
    "it is of great interest to examine the sources of large density fluctuations and to find ways for their detection so as to obtain useful information on the collision dynamics@xcite .    among the many different ways to study a quark - gluon plasma , intensity interferometry ( hbt interferometry ) is one of the experimental tools to examine the space - time density distribution of the produced matter@xcite .",
    "the usual application of the hbt interferometry uses pairs of identical particles from many events ( multi - event analysis ) of similar general characteristics to study the ( averaged ) space - time configuration . because of the difference in initial conditions in different collision events",
    ", different collisions will lead to different density fluctuations for some degrees of freedom while retaining similar fluctuations for some other degrees of freedom .",
    "an average over many events in a standard hbt analysis will lead to a distribution with suppressed fluctuations in event - dependent degrees of freedom but will retain those fluctuations in event - independent degrees of freedom . the proposed single - event hbt analysis , if it can be carried out with sufficient accuracy , allows the examination of the full characteristics of large scale density fluctuations without suppression .",
    "the observation of hbt interferometry in atomic systems also make it interesting to examine the interference pattern in systems with large macroscopic density fluctuations@xcite .",
    "if the statistics of identical bosons turns out to be insufficient for single - event hbt analyses using presently available detectors , it will be of interest to carry out few - event hbt analyses to examine event - independent density fluctuations .",
    "the few - event analysis will however require a good theoretical understanding of the single - event hbt interferometry .    with the example of a granular density distribution to indicate the type of correlations one can get in a large scale density fluctuation",
    ", we shall show that the correlation function of a highly fluctuating density distribution is likewise highly fluctuating , with maxima and minima at locations which depend on the relative coordinates of the density centers .",
    "these local maxima and minima arise from the constructive and destructive interferences of identical bosons originating from two different centers .",
    "their interference patterns therefore provide useful information on highly fluctuation density distributions in high - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "in many simulations of the heavy - ion collisions on an event - by - event basis , the initial transverse energy density is far from being uniform .",
    "it exhibits large transverse density fluctuations with a large peak - to - valley ratio@xcite . a number of transverse density ` lumps ' are clearly visible in the initial transverse density distribution of the produced matter in fig .",

    "the pion - emitting source produced by the participants may retain part of the initial momenta in different spatial regions . if the produced matter constituents retain a large fraction of the initial momenta , they can be approximately idealized as two pion emitting clusters as shown in fig . 2@xmath1 . on the other hand , if a significant fraction of the participant matter in the overlapping region is stopped while the more peripheral constituents moves in their original directions , the pion emitting source can be approximated as consisting of three clusters as in fig",

    "= -2 = -2.3 in another source of density fluctuation arises from the occurrence of first - order phase transition , as was first pointed out by witten@xcite and examined by many workers@xcite .",
    "according to such a description , incipient bubbles of low - density matter ( hadrons ) are formed in some local regions in a nearly static quark - gluon plasma , as the local temperature decreases below the phase transition temperature .",
    "the coalescence of these bubbles leads to bubbles of larger radii .",
    "as the system cools further , the fraction of matter in the low - density bubbles will become greater than the fraction of high - density matter ( qgp ) , and the high - density matter will turn into lumps in the low - density matter background .",
    "the density of such a configuration is highly fluctuating .",
    "still another source of density fluctuation arises from the effects of surface tension during the evolution of the strongly - interacting matter . because the qgp and the hadron matter are strongly interacting dense media ,",
    "a surface tension arises at a boundary due to the presence of a strong interaction in the dense phase on one side of the boundary and the absence ( or weakening ) of the strong interaction with no density ( or diminishing density ) on the other side .",
    "this imbalance of the forces acting on different parts at the boundary leads to the surface tension , and the detail profile of the boundary may depend on the nature and the order of phase transition . due to the presence of this surface tension",
    ", there may be the instability against surface shape changes that favors the formation of surfaces of smallest areas in different local regions . such a tendency lead to large spatial density fluctuations .",
    "the end product may be the multi - fragmentation of the strongly - interacting matter .",
    "multi - fragmentation has been observed in intermediate energy heavy - ion collisions@xcite .",
    "in order to understand how the features of the correlation function may be affected by the presence of large density fluctuations , it is worth studying the correlation function of identical particles of momentum @xmath2 and @xmath3 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 for an idealized chaotic droplet sources@xcite . there is a relation between the two - boson correlation function and the fourier transform of the source density @xmath6 , which we assume to be independent of @xmath7 , @xmath8 for brevity of notation , we shall leave the label @xmath9 implicit and understood .",

    "the number of correlation function maxima for 8 droplets is greater than the number of maxima for 4 droplets .",
    "the smaller the number of droplets , the greater will be the magnitude of fluctuations , as can be easily deduced from eq.([eq31 ] ) .",
    "previously , we examine the two - pion interferometry for a granular source of quark - gluon plasma droplets and found that the granular model of the emitting source may provide an explanation to the rhic hbt @xmath35 puzzle@xcite .",
    "we also investigate two - pion bose - einstein correlations of many droplets in single - event measurements .",

    "3 . the correlation function for a two static droplet source .",
    "the case of @xmath36 presents an interesting example of the fluctuation of the hbt correlation functions . for the case of two static droplets of @xmath37 fm at an approximately touching configuration with a separation of @xmath38 fm in the @xmath39 direction , figs.(3@xmath1 )",

    "this @xmath39-axis can be considered as the axis joining the centers of the two clusters initially .",

    "( [ cq ] ) .",
    "if the statistics of single - event is insufficient , one can perform an `` aligned '' multi - event hbt analysis by referring to the transverse axis in the reaction plane of each and every event as the @xmath39-axis .",

    "thus , while the single - event and the aligned multi - event analyses provide information on the fluctuation of the correlation function , the unaligned multi - event analysis will give the @xmath67 ratio to provide useful information on the emission time and the relative velocity of the two clusters .",
    "density fluctuation occurs in high - energy heavy - ion collisions in many ways . it can arise from initial transverse density fluctuations as a result of the underlying granular structure of the colliding constituent nucleons .",
    "it can come from the non - central character of the collisions , leading to two or three clusters of pion emitting clusters .",
    "it can arise from the occurrence of first - order phase transitions .",
    "it can come from the surface tension effects which tend to form clusters of strongly - interacting matter during its evolution .",
    "the surface tension effects also lead to the multi - fragmentation of the produced matter into small clusters .",
    "some of these density fluctuation sources are expected to be commonly present and may be detected by single - event hbt interferometry .    in a nearly head - on collision at very high energies ,",
    "the number of identical pions is of the order of a few thousand .",
    "the number of observed identical pions @xmath68 is a small fraction of this number .",
    "for example , the number of identical pions detected in the star collaboration in the most central au - au collisions at rhic is of the order of a few hundred@xcite .",
    "although the number of pairs of identical pions in the event varies as @xmath69 , only a small fraction of these pairs have relative momenta small enough to be useful in a hbt analysis .",
    "clearly , whether or not single - event hbt measurements can be carried out remains to be tested .    if the statistics of identical bosons turns out to be insufficient for single - event analyses using the present detectors , there remains the future prospect of performing single - event hbt analyses at rhic with detector upgrades or with heavy - ion collisions at lhc .",
    "it will also be of great interest to carry out few - event hbt analyses by using pairs of pions in events with similar global characteristics .",
    "because of the difference in initial conditions in different collision events , different collisions will lead to different density fluctuations for some degrees of freedom while retaining similar fluctuations for some other degrees of freedom .",
    "the use of few - event hbt analyses may still retain those fluctuations from event - independent degrees of freedom .",
    "this may be particularly useful in the examination of two or three cluster configurations in non - central collisions by collecting events of similar impact parameters and looking at pion pairs from these events .",
    "while the single - event and the aligned multi - event analyses provide information on the fluctuation of the correlation function , the multi - event analysis will give the @xmath67 ratio which will provide useful information on the emission time and the relative velocity of the two clusters .",
