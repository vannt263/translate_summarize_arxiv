    "in two dimensions ( 2d ) the wavefunction of indistinguishable particles can have exotic exchange properties : upon the exchange of two particles known as `` anyons ''  @xcite it acquires a phase factor @xmath2 with an arbitrary statistical angle @xmath3 .",
    "this is in contrast to the situation in higher dimensions where @xmath4 or @xmath5 corresponding to bosons or fermions , respectively .",
    "the reason for this departure from the usual quantum statistics arises from the unique topological properties of 2d systems .",
    "@xcite if the ground state of such identical particles is degenerate the exchange operations can be described by matrices in the degenerate subspace , which are generically non - abelian .",
    "such particles are referred to as non - abelian anyons .",
    "it is also known that particles with fractional charge may arise , regardless of dimensionality , as the collective response of a many - body system to topologically nontrivial background fields .",
    "@xcite    the interest in anyons is not merely academic .",
    "the topological character of anyons means that local perturbations alter their properties exponentially weakly with a characteristic length of the order of the separation between anyons .",
    "( for a single anyon this length scale is replaced by the system size . )",
    "this `` topological protection '' has been argued to be useful for fault - tolerant quantum information processing .",
    "@xcite if the anyons have a rich enough non - abelian structure , one may realize a universal quantum computer , in which computations are performed by braiding anyons .",
    "@xcite otherwise , topological protection for a non - universal subset of operations may be obtained . in any case , the system can be considered , at least , as a topologically protected quantum memory . however , the insensitivity to local perturbations also poses a problem for manipulating anyons , which is necessary for braiding operations , and for the storage and retrieval of information from the quantum memory .        how could anyons be realized in nature",
    "of course , the first condition is the restriction to two spatial dimensions .",
    "the fact that the world is three - dimensional immediately implies that anyons can only be realized as collective excitations of a many - body system whose constituent particles are necessarily fermions or bosons .",
    "the emergence of such excitations constitutes the phenomenon of fractionalization in condensed - matter systems .",
    "wilczek  @xcite proposed a simple model of an anyon as a bound state of a charge @xmath6 and magnetic flux @xmath7 , in which either the charge or the flux , or both , have a fractional value in units of the electron charge , @xmath8 , and flux quantum @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "a closely related state is realized in a 2d electron gas ( 2deg ) in a perpendicular magnetic field in the fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) regime , described by the filling factor @xmath10 .",
    "when @xmath11 is an odd integer the excitations carry a fractional charge @xmath12 ( ref .  ) and have a statistical angle @xmath13 ( ref .  ) .",
    "fqh physics is the canonical example of fractionlaization .",
    "the coulomb interaction is understood to play an important role in stabilizing the fqh states , which may be considered strongly correlated in the sense that they can not be described by filling a set of single - particle states .",
    "one may naturally ask , then , if this is a necessary condition of fractionalization .",
    "it has been known for a long time that strong correlations are not necessary for fractionalization of charge in one and three dimensions , @xcite where exchange statistics are trivial . in two dimensions , fractional charge and statistics",
    "have recently been argued to arise in certain lattice models  @xcite that preserve time - reversal symmetry and can be considered weakly - interacting .",
    "furthermore , we proposed  @xcite a weakly - interacting system to realize anyons that can be described by a slater determinant of single - particle states .",
    "this proposal has the potential to be useful for manipulating anyons . unlike some other proposals it also has a realistic chance to be fabricated in the lab .",
    "the system consists of a 2deg in the _ integer _ quantum hall state adjacent to a thin slab of a type - ii superconductor .",
    "the idea is to employ the quantization of flux by the superconductor in units of @xmath14 , i.e. _ half _ the natural quantum of flux of the 2deg , as well as the quantization of hall conductance in the quantum hall state of the 2deg .",
    "a sketch of a possible arrangement is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sys ] .",
    "we have chosen a symmetric placement of superconducting films around the 2deg in order to minimize the spread and the in - plane component of the vortex magnetic field at the 2deg .",
    "this is not necessary if similar conditions can be obtained in a different geometry .",
    "both of these systems admit an effective single - particle description .",
    "the integer quantum hall state can be understood as a full landau level of essentially free electrons .",
    "the superconductor may be described as a condensate of cooper pairs .",
    "it is then interesting that the proximity of these two weakly - interacting systems results in the fractionalization of charge and statistics .",
    "anyons are formed in response to defects in a pinned abrikosov vortex lattice in the superconducting film .",
    "such defects may be detected and manipulated by scanning superconducting quantum interference devices ( squid ) and hall bar probes or magnetic tips in magnetic force microscopy that have been developed over the years .",
    "@xcite therefore , our anyons have the additional potential of being manipulated despite their topological protection .",
    "as we shall describe in the conclusion a similar setup with the fqh state at @xmath15 should realize , and allow for the manipulation of , non - abelian anyons .",
    "these anyons are robust as long as the spread of the vortex - lattice defect , controlled by the superconducting penetration depth and the distance between the two layers , is small relative to the distance between the defects .    in the present paper , in addition to providing the details and some extensions of our previous analysis ,  @xcite we present new analytical and numerical work from alternative starting points that shed light on different aspects of the system .",
    "moreover , we present a novel and concrete method to measure the fractional charge of anyons in a bulk transport experiment that utilizes the vortices in the superconducting film .",
    "we also describe an idea for the `` anyon shuttle '' , a system to manipulate anyons bound to the flux defects by purely electrical means .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sys ] we describe the system and provide a general argument for our findings . in sec .",

    "[ sec : exp ] contains our proposal to measure the fractional charge and a description of the anyon shuttle .",
    "finally , we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] by discussing the conditions for the experimental realization of the system .",
    "details of some calculations as well as the derivation of some known results are given in appendices  [ app : schr][app : tknn ] in order to make the paper self - contained .",
    "the proposed system has two components : a layer hosting a 2deg in an integer quantum hall state , and a film of type - ii superconductor .",
    "the purpose of the superconducting film is to quantize the magnetic flux into an abrikosov vortex lattice , where each vortex carries a flux @xmath14 , which plays a central role in the physics we describe .",
    "cooper pair condensation in the superconducting film ensures that this quantization is extremely precise .    as mentioned above , the anyon is to be realized in the 2deg in response to a defect , i.e. an extra or missing @xmath14 flux in the vortex lattice .",
    "however , a naturally formed abrikosov lattice is ( almost ) incompressible .",
    "@xcite this means that if defects are to be created by moving one of the vortices , the vortex lattice will rearrange itself in such a way as to compensate for the additional or missing flux in the corresponding regions .",
    "thus , in order to allow for the creation of such defects , we propose to artificially imprint an array of pinning sites on the superconducting film .",
    "the pinning sites are regions where superconducting order is weakened and can be created in a variety of ways .",
    "@xcite they attract and pin superconducting vortices , thereby preventing the incompressible rearrangement of vortices in response to a defect . at the matching field @xmath16",
    "the number of vortices equals the number of pinning sites .",
    "an increase ( decrease ) in the field away from @xmath16 will induce a corresponding number of interstitial ( vacancy ) defects in the pinned vortex lattice with a surplus ( deficit ) flux of @xmath14 .",
    "the interstitials can then be manipulated by a magnetic tip .",
    "@xcite    what is the response of the 2deg system to a flux defect in the superconducting vortex lattice ? to answer this question we will make two working assumptions .",
    "the first one is that the 2deg is indeed in the integer quantum hall state . in particular , we assume that the spatial variation in the field does not destroy this state .",
    "second , we assume that the energetics of the system are dominated by the superconducting film .",
    "importantly , this means that the quantization of flux by cooper pairs remains valid and exact .",
    "we shall discuss the conditions under which these assumptions hold true in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "consequently , the question is reduced to : what is the response of the integer quantum hall state in 2deg to a surplus / deficit flux of @xmath14 ?    the answer is found by a thought experiment in which we slowly turn on the extra flux @xmath17 in time @xmath18 from zero to @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "the total charge accumulated at the position of the defect is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a contour in the plane containing the defect , @xmath23 is a unit vector normal to it , and @xmath24 an element of length of @xmath22 . in this process",
    "an electric field is induced in the plane by faraday s law , @xmath25 .",
    "an electric field in the quantum hall state with filling factor @xmath10 results in a transverse electric current @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the normal to the plane and @xmath28 is the quantized hall conductance .",
    "altogether , we find from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dqje ] ) , @xmath29 we note that for this result to be valid , the size of @xmath22 needs to be much larger than both the size of the flux defect , and the size of the smallest landau orbit . the former is determined by the penetration depth , @xmath30 , in the superconducting film , which comes in through the use of farady s law .",
    "we shall see its role more clearly in secs .",
    "[ sec : contal ] and  [ sec : eff ] .",
    "the latter is of the order of the magnetic length @xmath31 and is implied by the physics of the quantum hall state , as will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : cont ] .",
    "thus , at @xmath32 , we have uncovered a bound state of charge @xmath33 and flux @xmath34 . this is an almost literal realization of wilczek s model of an anyon .",
    "@xcite however , based on an analogy with the fqh quasiparticles , we expect a statistical angle @xmath35 , as opposed to the @xmath36 that would follow from aharonov - bohm phases . that this is the correct result can be affirmed by using the fusion rule@xcite : the statistical angle of a composite of @xmath37 anyons with statistical angle",
    "@xmath3 is @xmath38 .",
    "putting two bound states @xmath39 together we must obtain an electron , a fermion : @xmath40 .",
    "this is consistent with @xmath41 . in effect",
    ", the anyon carries the memory of its fermionic past .",
    "these general findings will be confirmed by our detailed studies in the rest of the paper .",
    "as a first concrete model of our system , we will study a continuum model of noninteracting electrons in the 2deg layer in magnetic field at filling factor @xmath32 . in a uniform magnetic field",
    "the energy levels are organized in landau levels with a degeneracy @xmath42 per spin , the total number of flux quanta in the plane .",
    "the ultimate goal of this study is to find the levels in the periodic magnetic field generated by the abrikosov lattice of vortices in the superconducting film and in the presence of vacancies and interstitial defects .",
    "not surprisingly , the full solution can only be obtained numerically , but we will find analytical solutions for simpler cases . especially , we will use the general solution for the ground states of a 2deg in an _ arbitrary _ magnetic field , due to aharonov and casher ,  @xcite in the special case of `` pauli '' electrons , i.e. free electrons with the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath43 .",
    "we do not know the general form of the wavefunctions for other values of @xmath44 , but for large enough @xmath45 , the zeeman coupling can be replaced with the condition that all electrons are in a single spin state , aligned with the magnetic field .",
    "we can then find the single - particle spectrum in the simple case of a uniform background field with vacancy and interstitial defects modeled by a @xmath46-function profile .",

    "the vector potential is given , in the symmetric gauge , by @xmath52 where @xmath20 is the fraction of the flux quantum carried by the defect .",

    "so , we arrive at a particularly simple relation for the fractional charge of defects , namely , @xmath463 the fractional charge bound to the vortex is thus simply related to the ratio of two experimentally measurable voltages .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that eq .",
    "( [ eq : fracch ] ) is an exact relation whose validity relies only on the fundamental properties of a superconductor and a 2deg in the quantum hall regime at filling fraction @xmath10 .",
    "observing fractional statistics is a much more difficult feat requiring precise interference experiments .",
    "however , in our system , the fact that the anyons have a physical flux attached to them might prove useful .",
    "for instance , it is possible to perform _ bulk _ , as opposed to edge , measurements on the system .",
    "bulk sources and drains of fractional particles may be created by building sources and sinks of flux tubes .",
    "explicitly , we will in the following lay out an _ all electrical _ scheme for shuttling fractional particles around along any desired path of a superlattice of holes drilled in both the layers of the system .",
    "a sketch of one such design is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : shuttle ] .     and separation @xmath464 , both @xmath465 , is used as source and sink of anyons .",
    "the arrows on the lower left hole shows the chiral edge currents concealed on other holes for clarity .",
    "the black squares are the leads on the superconducting film.,width=230 ]    an array of holes drilled through both the superconducting film and the 2deg layer provides the sources and drains of anyons through a supply of superconducting vortices trapped in the holes .",
    "the hole diameter , @xmath466 , and spacing , @xmath464 , between them are both much larger than the penetration depth @xmath30 . in equilibrium the magnetic flux through each hole",
    "will be quantized in units of @xmath467 . in the",
    "2deg each hole has a set of low - energy chiral edge states with discrete spectrum due to the finite hole size .",
    "these edge states can accommodate extra charge which is crucial for the functioning of the anyon shuttle .",
    "now imagine we attach wires to the superconducting film at the centers of the square leads as indicated in fig  [ fig : shuttle ] . through these wires",
    "we can feed appropriate supercurrents .",
    "when the current is sufficiently strong the resulting magnus force @xmath468 moves the vortices .",
    "if the geometry is right vortices will move from one hole to another , carrying fractional charge with them .",
    "as before , the number of vortices traversing between the holes can be determined from the voltage drop via the josephson relation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : jv ] ) . using a suitable sequence of current pulses",
    "it is possible to shuttle vortices along any desired path in the device , effectively braiding them as required in various quantum computation schemes .",
    "an important feature of this scheme is its being completely electrical , foregoing the need for any moving parts .",
    "we believe this is a major advantage especially in view of possible applications of non - abelian anyons in quantum computation as briefly discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .    using this shuttling scheme it should also be possible to perform bulk interference measurements to measure the fractional statistics of the anyons .",
    "a variety of such measurements exists , especially in the context of fqh physics . assessing the merits of any of these setups in the current system , however , requires a detailed study and is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we shall only note that an important condition for such interference experiments is the quantum coherence of the fractional bound states at least over the distance they move and the period of observation .",
    "while we do not see a general reason forbidding this coherence , attaining it in a real system will present a significant experimental challenge .",
    "we showed in detail that the proximity of two well - understood , weakly interacting systems can result in some very interesting phenomena .",
    "neither the superconductor nor the integer quantum hall state in the 2deg support fractionally charged quasiparticles .",
    "their ground states can be understood by filling a set of single - particle states . however , when brought together , they give rise to excitations that carry fractional charge and obey fractional statistics .",
    "this result rests on the following general conditions : ( i ) the exact quantization of flux by the superconducting film in integer multiples of @xmath14 , half the natural flux quantum of the 2deg ; ( ii ) the incompressibility of the quantum hall state of the 2deg ; and ( iii ) the pinning of the background abrikosov vortex lattice by the artificial array of pinning sites",
    ". conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) are manifestations of gauge invariance and are hence robust against weak perturbation ( hence , disorder ) in the system . condition ( iii )",
    "is necessary to keep the vortex lattice from adjusting itself when a quantized flux moves , basically allowing defects to be created .",
    "otherwise , the incompressible vortex lattice will rearrange and thus screen any excess charge from accumulating in the 2deg .",
    "this general basis is what connects our different studies in previous sections .",
    "the tight - binding model is relevant for strong zeeman coupling due to large values of the gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "@xcite the continuum model of spin - polarized electrons with uniform background field is relevant for large values of penetration depth , @xmath469 , whereas the intermediate regime was explored by the continuum model of pauli electrons with @xmath43 .",
    "finally , the effective theory formulation allowed us to properly account for the role of the superconductor and clarify the origin of the length scale @xmath131 , and @xmath186 in sec .",
    "[ sec : cont ] .    a conceptual subtlety must be noted in our usage of the terms `` quasiparticle '' and `` excitation '' for the bound states produced by the vortex lattice defects .",
    "these bound states are clearly not excitations of the 2deg in isolation . indeed , inserting a flux",
    "@xmath470 changes the hamiltonian , and hence the energy spectrum , of the 2deg . a true excitation of the isolated 2deg is only found by inserting a flux @xmath471 , the natural flux quantum for unpaired electrons .",
    "however , these bound states are true excitations of the system as a whole in much the same way as the fractionally charged domain walls of the polyacetylene chain are true excitations of the 1d electron - phonon system .",
    "@xcite in both cases , the electronic system in the 2deg or 1d chain responds to defects in an ordered state arising from external interactions , in our case in the supercondcuting film and in the polyacetylene case in the ionic system .",
    "this is also clearly seen in the effective theory formulation of sec .",
    "[ sec : eff ] : a vortex defect in the vortex - lattice phase is a finite - energy excitation of the whole system , shown to have fractional charge and statistics .",
    "we briefly comment on the range of parameters necessary to realize our proposed system in the laboratory .",
    "several length scales must be considered : the penetration depth @xmath30 , the coherence length @xmath186 , the magnetic length @xmath102 , the thickness @xmath464 of the superconducting film , the separation @xmath86 between the superconductor and the 2deg , and the size @xmath91 of the system .",
    "a natural order between some of these scales must exist in order to realize the physics discussed in this paper . specifically , we need @xmath472 .",
    "the requirement @xmath473 ensures the superconductor is a strong type - ii with high enough @xmath474 the external field needed to realize the quantum hall state in the 2deg . in high - temperature cuprate superconductors",
    "@xmath475 1000    and @xmath476 10   and @xmath477 can go beyond 100 t ( ref .  ) .",
    "typical values of @xmath235 are 515 t in semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "@xcite this corresponds to @xmath478 150  , which determines the average spacing of the artificial lattice of pinning sites .",
    "this value is not too far from what is achievable in today s artificial structures  @xcite and can be increased if lower values of @xmath235 are possible .",
    "also , one could partially pin only a subset of the abrikosov lattice using a larger lattice spacing with a specially engineered shape . for a large enough subset and the right shape ,",
    "the rest of the vortex lattice will be pinned by vortex - vortex interactions .",
    "defects may be created and moved the easiest when @xmath479 .",
    "however , the bulk penetration depth is modified in a thin film , given by the effective pearl penetration depth @xmath480 , and diverges as @xmath481 .",
    "this would destroy the bound state . therefore the optimal conditions to allow the creation and motion of defects as well as the corresponding bound states are found when @xmath482 .",
    "we also require the size of the system to be larger than all other length scales to enhance the 2d nature of the system and minimize any field leakage from the edges of the system .",
    "ideally , the separation @xmath483 so that most of the field that exists at the surface of the superconductor enters the 2deg . however , we expect our conclusions to stand with minor corrections up to @xmath484 .    the free electrons with gyromagnetic ratio @xmath43 considered in sec .  [",
    "sec : free ] may not be just a theoretically convenient limit .",
    "such electrons are realized on the surface of liquid helium and have been under investigation for some time .",
    "@xcite the typical electron density and mobility has so far been generally smaller than those in the semiconductor heterostructures and , to the best of our knowledge , a quantum hall state has not been obtained yet .",
    "finally , we note that the same set - up can be used with the _ fractional _ quantum hall states of the 2deg .",
    "for instance , when @xmath15 , by the same general argument leading to eq .",
    "( [ eq : dqgen ] ) we find @xmath485 this is the same charge carried by the true excitations of the moore - read state ,  @xcite thought to describe the ground state at @xmath15 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the moore - read state can be thought of as a paired - state of electrons ( corresponding to a @xmath486 superconductor with a fixed particle number ) , which implies the natural flux quantum in this state is indeed @xmath14 .",
    "we then predict that the bound states found in such a set - up will behave as non - abelian anyons .",
    "@xcite if so , our proposals for detecting the fractional charge and the all - electric anyon shuttle in sec .",
