    "it is convenient to introduce yet another fermion @xmath227 via @xmath228 , where @xmath229 is an auxiliary fermion .",
    "this standard procedure is explained in detail in the textbook @xcite . in the fermionized framework ,",
    "( [ fullhami ] ) becomes @xmath230 with @xmath231 determining the degree of asymmetry of the junction . in this form",
    ", the hamiltonian can be diagonalized immediately , and following refs .",
    "@xcite , a self - consistency relation determining @xmath232 follows @xmath233 where @xmath234 is the digamma function .",
    "the currents @xmath171 are then given by eq .",
    "( [ solone ] ) , with @xmath235 obtained as the self - consistent solution of eq .",
    "( [ reffini ] ) .",
    "one checks easily that the @xmath175 corrections for small @xmath236 predicted by this solution coincide with our previous perturbative results , see eq .",
    "( [ deli ] ) for @xmath214 . in the opposite limit of strong asymmetry",
    ", we find the expansion @xmath237 this corresponds to the highly asymmetric case with almost no current through tube 1 and the currents through tubes 2 and 3 given by @xmath238 .",
    "remarkably , this procedure allows to nonperturbatively treat the full crossover between a symmetric y junction and a single swnt that is approached by the tip of another swnt at some point in its bulk .",
    "the corresponding asymptotic power law exponents therefore correspond to the sum of end and bulk exponents in the tunneling density of states @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that the situation of a perfect beam splitter can not be described by our model .",
    "this is due to the initial symmetry of our setup without impurities , while a beam splitter can only be realized if transport between two of the three tubes is totally suppressed @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have proposed a generalization of landauer - type transport theory to @xmath2-terminal starlike interacting nanotubes . due to the formulation of three different boundary conditions , reflecting the coupling to external leads , charge conservation , and density matching conditions at the node , it has been possible to find an analytical solution for the nonlinear conductance matrix of the symmetric system for arbitrary electron - electron interaction .",
    "based on the symmetric solution , we have constructed a wide class of asymmetric transmission matrices by adding impurities close to the node in the individual nanotubes .",
    "the asymmetric problem can be also be solved in a nonperturbative fashion if just one impurity is put into a nanotube arm . for simplicity",
    ", we have discussed this solution for the special interaction strength @xmath213 , corresponding to the toulouse limit in a folded picture .",
    "a largely open issue is the question of noise and particle statistics in such a nonchiral multi - terminal luttinger liquid network . for low energies , the disconnected - node fixed point seems to hinder the observation of fractional quasiparticle cross - correlations , because tunneling of electrons from one tube to the other is the first allowed process once the applied voltage is raised .",
    "however , for intermediate energies , which could be temperature and/or applied voltage in experiments , the disconnected fixed point opens up and quasiparticle tunneling between different tubes might give distinct features to the current cross correlations and therefore allow to study quasiparticle statistics .",
    "these questions will be studied in future work .",
