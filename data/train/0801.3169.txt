    "the current galaxy formation paradigm can be characterized by `` hierarchical clustering '' .",
    "this means that massive dark matter halos form by merging less massive halos and/or by accreting ambient matter , and also that a dark matter halo governs the evolution of the galaxy residing inside .",
    "most galaxies are believed to be hosted by the dark matter halos becuase the halos can provide a deep potential well for baryonic matter to condense and cool down .",
    "this leads to triggering of the star formation ; gas sufficiently accumulated in the halo potential center begins to experience many hydrodynamic processes , such as radiative cooling , star - formation , supernova explosion , and chemical enrichments .",
    "all of these processes play an important role in making the visible galaxies in the end . because galaxies as a building block of the large scale structures consequently follows the evolution of their host halos over the cosmic history , understanding gravitational evolution of dark halos is very important for the study of galaxy formation and evolution .    over the past few decades",
    ", cosmological simulations have been proved useful for the study of structure formation .",
    "simulations have boosted up many investigations of the nonlinear structure evolutions and their results have been extensively compared to the observations in various aspects of interest .",
    "many studies have reported successful recovery of observational features of the galaxy distribution like the two - point correlations of galaxies @xcite , topology @xcite , and the environmental dependence of spin distributions @xcite .",
    "detailed modeling of galaxy evolution and understanding of the galaxy properties have been possible with the recent advent of the huge redshift surveys such as sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and 2dfgrs .",
    "these larger surveys provide a rich information on the formation and evolution of galaxy . to meet a requirement to establish a relation between simulated structures and observed galaxies",
    "many techniques have been introduced .",
    "the semi - analytic model(sam ) of galaxy formation @xcite is based on the hierarchical clustering of halos whose merging history trees are built by generating a set of gaussian random numbers .",
    "the mass growth history of halos on various mass scales can be generated and traced by this method .",
    "numerous sam parameters are implemented in the merging history to reflect the hydrodynamical processes of heating , cooling , star formation , and aging the stellar populations .",
    "their parameter values are fine tunned for the best description of collective properties of observed galaxies . but",
    "as the number of observational contraints increases , the number of parameters increases and the sam becomes much complicated .",
    "hydrosimulations employ direct formulations of the hydrodynamic processes ( @xcite ) .",
    "two types of hydro simulations are now widely adopted ; the lagrangian @xcite and eulerian methods ( @xcite , and for comparative study , see @xcite ) .",
    "they set gas particles or gas grids in the system of interest .",
    "then , gas dynamics are taken into account by calculating the hydrodynamic interactions between neighbor particles or by solving differential hydro equations between adjacent grids .",
    "this method has several weak points ; it suffers from the lack of resolutions in space and mass as the n - body simulations . and",
    "in most cases , the star formation and supernova explosions are far beyond the simulation resolution .",
    "some processes such as radiative transfer , star formation , supernovae feedback , and initial stellar mass function , are not thoroughly understood and are difficult to parameterize in a well established way .",
    "one of the offsprings of the sam is the halo occupation distribution ( hod ; @xcite ) model .",
    "it relates the friend - of - friend ( fof ) halo mass to the number of contained subhalos ( or galaxies ) using a conditional probability , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the fof halo mass and @xmath2 is the number of subhalos inside the fof halo .",
    "this probability function is obtained from numerical simulations @xcite or from observations @xcite fitting the model to the observed two - point correlation functions .",
    "another variant of the sam is a one that adopts the one - to - one monotonic correspondence between the galaxy luminosity and subhalo mass @xcite .",
    "this method is often called the `` correspondence model '' .",
    "it is simpler than other methods because it requires only two prerequisites ; the luminosity function of galaxies and mass function of subhalos .",
    "its key assumption that a more massive subhalo hosts a brighter galaxy , is consistent with the hierarchical clustering picture . as the halo mass grows ,",
    "its luminosity is expected to grow in general because merging of halos may be followed by the merging of galaxies . by matching these two functions ,",
    "the subhalo mass is mapped to galaxy luminosity .    however , sometimes a galaxy may survive the merger event because baryonic component of a galaxy is usually more concentrated and is more tightly bound than its dark counterpart .",
    "these `` orphan '' galaxies @xcite which have no separate corresponding halos could exist in the cluster regions .",
    "also halos of mass below a certain characteristic scale are unable to provide baryonic matter with gravitational attraction strong enough to resist against supernova explosions which can tear up the small - mass system .",
    "even though such cases are many , it is sound to expect that the galaxy census is closely related to the population of subhalos because most of the observed galaxies are field galaxies who have their own dark halos .",
    "it is worth investigating the hypothesis of the subhalo - to - galaxy correspondence model of galaxy formation .    in this paper , we apply the subhalo - galaxy correspondence model to a large n - body simulation and compare the statistical properties of simulated galaxies with those of galaxies observed by the sdss .",
    "we organize this paper as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe our simulation and the subhalo finding method . in section 3",
    ", we implement the subhalo - galaxy correspondence model and show how to assign morphological types to mock galaxies . in section 4 , the local density is introduced to quantify local environments and the local density distributions of mock and sdss galaxies are investigated .",
    "we also compare the luminosity distribution of simulated galaxies with those of the sdss galaxies in section 5 .",
    "the environmental dependence of central velocity distributions are studied for the mock and sdss galaxies in section 6 . and",
    "discussions and conclusions follow in section 7 .",
    "we have carried out a cosmological n - body simulation of the universe with the wmap 3-year cosmological parameters .",
    "we ran @xmath3 cold dark matter particles using an improved version of the gotpm code @xcite .",
    "the code adopts a dynamical domain decomposition for the particle - mesh part with a variable width of the z - directional domain slabs .",
    "it also uses more compact and efficient oct - sibling tree walks reducing the computational cost for the short - range force update which consumes about 90 % of total run time . as a results , this new version outperforms the previous version by about factor three in speed .",
    "the simulation was run on a beowulf - type system installed at korea institute for advanced study .",
    "the linux cluster consists of 256 amd cores and 1 tera - byte main memory .",
    "the simulation and cosmological parameters adopted in this study are lists in table [ sim ] .",
    "the number of time steps in the simulations are empirically pre - determined to satisfy the requirement that the maximum displacement of particles in a step should be less than the force resolutions which is @xmath4 times the mean interparticle separation ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the starting epochs of simulations are chosen to constrain that any particle should not overshoot neighbors when the zeldovich displacement is made .",
    "subhalos are identified by the psb method @xcite .",
    "the method applies the fof algorithm to identify dark matter particle groups adopting the standard linking length , @xmath6 .",
    "then it divides each fof halo into subhalos .",
    "this two - stage halo finding is in common with other methods @xcite . in the second stage",
    "we build a particle density field by a coordinate - free method as usually adopted in the smoothed particle hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "this adaptive kernel implementation is intended to resolve tight clusterings of particles .",
    "then , we search for 26 nearest neighbors at each particle . to construct isodensity contour we move along the neighbor positions in a similar way used in the origingal psb method ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "self - bound and tidally stable subhalos are identified by measuring the tidal radius of the subhalos and total energies of their member particles ; member candidates are selected if their distances to the center of a subhalo are less than tidal radius of the subhalo . among these particles ,",
    "gravitationally unbound particles are discarded .",
    "the resulting subhalos are used to allocate galaxies .",
    "we call the most massive subhalo a central halo and other subhalos satellite halos in the fof group .",
    "also , the group of particles found by the fof method are named the fof group or fof halo .",

    "we use the monotonic one - to - one correspondence model between galaxies and subhalos ; there is one and only one galaxy in each subhalo and a more massive subhalo hosts a more luminous galaxy .",
    "we apply this model to assign galaxies within our simulation box .",
    "the one - to - one correspondence model is formalized in the following way .",
    "we first measure the mass function @xmath9 of psb subhalos .",
    "we then take the observed luminosity functions of the early ( e / s0 ) and late ( s / irr ) type galaxies .",
    "the relation between the halo mass and the corresponding absolute magnitude limits is given by the following integral equation .",
    "@xmath10 where @xmath11 is the subhalo mass function and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the luminosity functions of early and late type galaxies .",
    "in this equation we separate the full luminosity function of subhalos into those of early and late types to take into account the difference in mass of the halos associated with galaxies of different morphological type .",
    "two models are proposed to utilize the simple mass and luminosity scaling ratios between different morphological types at the fixed luminosity and at the fixed mass , respectively .",
    "the first model uses @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the subhalo mass , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the luminosities of late and early types , respectively .",
    "the equation means that at an equal luminosity the early type galaxy is @xmath18 times more massive than the late type galaxy .",
    "this model is based on the findings of park et al .",
    "( 2007a ) who have assured that the early type galaxies brighter than @xmath19 have about @xmath20 times higher central velocity dispersion and pairwise peculiar velocity difference compared to the late types of the same brightness .",
    "this implies @xmath21 if @xmath22 .",
    "another convencing observational evidence for @xmath23 can be also found in @xcite who obtained the same result for halos of mass greater than @xmath24 from the analysis of the galaxy - galaxy weak lensing of the sdss sample .",
    "equation ( [ fm ] ) then makes equation ( [ m2b ] ) a one - to - one relation between halo mass and galaxy luminosity . from now on ,",
    "we name it @xmath18 model .",
    "the second model uses a constant factor for the luminosity rather than the mass .",
    "this relation can be formulated as @xmath25 which says that late type galaxies are brighter than early type galaxies of the same mass by a factor of @xmath26 .",
    "now we call it the @xmath26 model .    for the galaxy luminosity distribution",
    ", we use the schechter function @xmath27,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we adopt the type - specific schechter function parameters @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 for early type galaxies and @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 for late types in the @xmath34 band , which are given in table 2 of choi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for the sdss galaxies brighter than @xmath35 ( hereafter , we will drop the term @xmath36 in the absolute magnitude and the magnitudes are all @xmath34band magnitude . )",
    "these parameter values are quite different from those given by @xcite and blanton et al .",
    "( 2003 ) mostly because we are using the type - specific functions . reducing the effects of the internal extinction by choi et al . also makes a significant difference in the @xmath37 parameter compared to blanton et al.s results .",
    "difference also comes from the data size ( dr4plus versus @xmath38dr1 ) , adopted cosmology ( @xmath39 versus @xmath40 ) , and sample definition ( volume - limited versus apparent magnitude - limited ) .    the @xmath26 model can be easily solved by using the relation , @xmath41 in equation ( [ m2b ] ) , but the @xmath18 model is a bit tricky to solve and needs a few assumptions . the @xmath18 model can be solved by a chain of equations whose @xmath42th term is , @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 for @xmath46 . here",
    "@xmath47 and @xmath48 denote the halo masses of late type and early type galaxies of absolute magnitude @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "if @xmath15 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 are given , then @xmath52 can be derived .",
    "figure [ kappa ] depicts the relations among the three magnitudes described above .",
    "the solid and dashed curves show the luminosity functions of early and late types , respectively . and",
    "the dotted line connects the same mass of the two morphological types .",
    "the shaded areas denoted by @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the integrated number densities of galaxies of magnitude between @xmath50 and @xmath51 for the late type and between @xmath51 and @xmath52 for the early type , respectively .",
    "therefore , the sum of the two shaded areas should be equal to the integrals of the subhalo mass function ( the left - hand side of eq .",
    "[ eqkappa ] ) .    by making a stride to the next mass scale which is smaller by @xmath55 times",
    ", we can get a chain of equations and derive the scaling relation between the mass and the luminosity . to solve this chain of equations we set initial conditions under the plausible assumption that the late - type contributions to the number density at the high - mass ( or bright ) end are negligible compared to those of early types ( or @xmath56 ) .",
    "this setting is quite fair from the fact that early type galaxies dominate the bright end population of galaxies .",
    "then , we are able to solve the series of equation ( [ eqkappa ] ) from the initial conditions where only the early - type contribution to number density is dominant .    now we investigate the early type fractions as a function of the host subhalo mass .",
    "the probability of a galaxy of mass @xmath15 to be early type is given by @xmath57 where the denominator is the luminosity function of all galaxies of mass @xmath15 and the numerator is the luminosity function of early types of mass @xmath15 .",
    "figure [ fe ] shows the results for the @xmath18 and @xmath26 models . using @xmath58 we are able to randomly assign morphological type to each mock galaxy in accordance with its halo mass . for a larger value of @xmath26",

    "but for the @xmath18 model , those changes in @xmath58 are not so much steep . also , in this plot , we note that a more dramatic change of the @xmath58 in the @xmath26 model than the @xmath18 model .",
    "figure [ m2 m ] shows the relation between the subhalo mass @xmath15 and absolute magnitude @xmath49 of early ( _ solid lines _ ) and late ( _ dashed lines _ ) type galaxies derived from equation ( [ m2b ] ) and the luminosity functions of the sdss galaxies in the @xmath18 ( _ upper _ ) and @xmath26 ( _ lower panels _ ) models . only shown",

    "( 2007 ) based on the hod model is given as filled circles .",
    "they obtained the magnitude - to - mass relation of the central subhalo but ignored the morphological types of galaxies .",

    "here we adopt @xmath63 @xcite to transform the magnitude to luminosity in the @xmath34band filter .",
    "it can be noted that galaxy luminosity drops steeply at the low mass end and rises in a power law at the high mass end .",
    "taking into account these features , we propose a function @xmath64 as a fitting function for the halo mass versus early - type galaxy luminosity relation .",
    "we apply the @xmath65square fitting to the relation and obtain the best - fit parameter values of @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 for the early type in the @xmath60 model . in the @xmath23 model , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 for early ( late ) type .",
    "only the fitting result for the early type in the @xmath60 model is shown by a short - dashed line .",

    "the long - dashed and dotted curves show those ratios of early and late type galaxies in the @xmath23 model . in the @xmath60 model",
    ", there is a upturn of the mass - to - light ratio of early types around @xmath72 ( for those measured in other bands , see @xcite ) , which means the star formation in galaxies is strongest at the mass scale .",
    "a fitting formula for the mass - to - light ratio is derived from equation ( [ analupsilon ] ) , @xmath73 using this equation , the mass scale corresponding to the minimum mass - to - light ratio can be related to the shape parameters as @xmath74 and the minimum mass - to - light ratio is @xmath75 for early type galaxies and @xmath76 for late types in the @xmath60 model .    according to our result",
    "the mass - to - light ratio of the brightest galaxies reaches much higher than @xmath77 .",
    "but this value is too high compared to those reported in literature .",
    "for example , @xcite noted that a mass - to - light of early types reaches @xmath78 for their brightest samples ( @xmath79 in tab .",
    "4 of their paper ) of the sdss lensing galaxies .",
    "the discrepancy may be explained by the fact that they are typically the brightest cluster galaxies . in our psb halo identification method",
    "all mass not assigned to satellite galaxies is assigned to the central subhalo after the boundness check , which makes the central subhalo as massive as the whole cluster and their mass - to - light ratio very large ( _ cf . _",
    "fig . 10 in @xcite and fig . 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "then , the group or cluster mass - to - light ratio is the one to be compared at the very high mass scales .",
    "for a comparative study of the environmental effects on the spatial and luminosity distributions of observed and simulated galaxies , a quantitative measure of the local environment is needed . to minimize the parameterizations and maximize the spatial resolution we use the spline kernel to obtain the smooth galaxy number density field .",
    "it is given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "the kernel is centrally weighted more than the gaussian , and has only one parameter , @xmath82 .",
    "it is smooth to the second order and has a finite tail out to @xmath83 . throughout this paper",
    "we set @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the distance to the twentieth nearest neighbor galaxy . due to these features and to the adaptive nature of @xmath82",
    "the resulting galaxy density map better represent the observed distribution of galaxies than the gaussian , particularly in voids and clustered regions . to compare the observed and mock galaxy samples , it is necessary to make the number density of the density tracers the same .",
    "we use galaxies brighter than @xmath86 as the galaxy density tracers .",
    "this selection differs slightly from that adopted by @xcite who chose @xmath87 .",
    "we removed the bright cut to better resolve the centers of clusters where galaxies brighter than @xmath88 are concentrated .",
    "the local density at galaxy positions is measured in our sdss volume - limited samples .",
    "the density estimate is corrected for the boundary effects when the kernel sphere of radius @xmath85 overlaps with the survey boundary .",
    "the late type galaxies having axis ratio @xmath89 are removed from the sample to reduce the effects of internal absorption on luminosity .",
    "after this exclusion , we give the weight of 1/0.505 to late type galaxies to correct the galaxy number density for the missing inclined ones , where @xmath90 is the fraction of late types with @xmath91 in a sample containing galaxies down to @xmath92 ( the cm sample of choi et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the correction for boundary effect is unnecessary for mock galaxies since their distribution is periodic in all directions .",
    "the redshift distortions effects caused by the peculiar velocities are mimicked by shifting the mock galaxies along the @xmath93 axis using @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the @xmath93-component of peculiar velocity and @xmath96 is the hubble constant .",
    "figure [ densim ] shows the distribution of local density ( _ open circles _ ) at the location of galaxies in two volume - limited sdss samples with absolute magnitude limits of @xmath97 ( d5 ) and @xmath98 ( d2 ) for the @xmath60 model .",
    "also plotted are the local density distributions of simulated galaxies selected by the same magnitude - limit criteria .",
    "it can be noted that the local density distributions of the sdss galaxies and the corresponding mock galaxies match closely to each other at all densities except for at high densities .",
    "also those distributions for the @xmath23 model are shown in figure [ kdensim ] with the same criteria .",
    "@xcite employed a log normal function to fit the one - point distribution of dark matter density and luminosity density in their hydro - simulation .",
    "a spherical top - hat filter of constant radius is adopted in their study .",
    "they found a good agreement between the simulated density distributions and the log normal distribution while the distribution of luminosity density shows a poor fit .",

    "late type galaxies dominate these regions . from these figures",
    ", it appears that the galaxy morphology depends only on the halo mass and does not directly depend on environment .",

    "we will further investigate this effect by comparing the luminosity functions of the sdss with those of the mock galaxies in various environments in the next section . in the high density regions our model gives too few galaxies , which is probably due to the insufficient resolution of the simulation to maintain small subhalos within clusters and to the lack of gas physics .",
    "there have been several works reporting the environmental dependence of the galaxy luminosity function ( park et al .",
    "1994 and 2007a in observations and @xcite in the hod model ) .",
    "it was found that the characteristic galaxy luminosity ( @xmath88 ) is an increasing function of the local density , and the faint - end slope ( @xmath37 ) of the luminosity function is insensitive to the local density",
    ". however , park et al . ( 2007a ) used a spline kernel weighting to estimate local densities , and @xcite ( also @xcite ) use a spherical top - hat filter of a constant radius . for a quantitative comparison between observations and models",

    "we investigate the distribution of the absolute magnitude of early and late type galaxies located in different local density environment .",
    "this gives us environment and morphology - specific luminosity function of galaxies . in our galaxy morphology assignment scheme",
    "we only use the observed total luminosity function and the parameter @xmath26 ( or @xmath18 ) , the ratio of luminosity ( or mass ) of the early and late types at a fixed mass ( or luminosity ) . it will be interesting to see how accurately our model reproduces the observed luminosity functions at different local densities and for different morphological types . for this comparison we use the luminosity functions measured from the d3 sample of park et al .",
    "( 2007a ) because this absolute magnitude - limited sample covers both bright and faint magnitudes well , relative to other volume - limited samples .",
    "the fitting of the measured luminosity functions to the schechter formula is carried out by using the minuit packages which employ the maximum likelihood method .",
    "figure [ complf ] and [ kcomplf ] show the comparison of the luminosity functions in four different local density regions in the @xmath60 and @xmath23 models .",
    "the resulting environment and morphology - specific luminosity function reproduces the observations surprisingly well . however , there are notable disagreements for two cases . at very high densities ( @xmath113 )",
    "the abundance of faint early type galaxies are significantly low in the simulation .",
    "this is again probably due to the lack of small subhalos that were destroyed in high density environment .",
    "another problem is seen at low densities ( @xmath114 ) , where the early type galaxies are too few in the bright end of luminosity function .",
    "it seems that the morphology transformatin to bright early types in underdense regions through close interactions and mergers is more efficient in the nature than in our model ( @xcite for observational evidence ) . in the high density regions ,",
    "the @xmath23 model describes the number distribution of faint late type galaxies better than the @xmath60 model while this @xmath18 model shows a slight overestimation in the population of faint late types in the mean fields ( @xmath115 ) compared to the observation .",

    "the parameter @xmath37 of the simulation is quite different from the observation at @xmath119 for early type galaxies .",

    ", we make a rough estimation of the relation between @xmath126 and @xmath127 , where @xmath126 is the line - of - sight aperture velocity dispersion and @xmath127 is the virial velocity .",
    "according to @xcite , the resulting scaling ratio of the velocity dispersions , @xmath128 , is @xmath129 for the acceptable ranges of the velocity anisotropy and the concentration parameter in @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the comoving aperture radius .",
    "here we assume that @xmath132 , where @xmath120 is the three - dimensional velocity dispersion and @xmath133 . in the range of @xmath134 written in equation ( [ fc ] ) , we simply set @xmath135 ( @xmath124 ) , @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) , @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) , and @xmath140 ( @xmath141 ) to match for the mean amplitudes of velocity dispersions for each mock and sdss sample pair . at a fixed luminosity the velocity dispersion of the early type mock galaxies increases as the local density increases for bright galaxies and the slopes are decreasing for the faint sample .",
    "it is reassuring that this trend is exactly the kind of phenomenon found in the observation ( _ gray symbols _ ) .",
    "while the switch of the slope in the faintest sdss samples is not clearly observed in the mock sample ( it shows a nearly flat slope on the local environments ) , the change of the slope is similar to each other . both observation and our model show that the mass - to - light ratio of the early type galaxies is a function of environment , and that this dependence in turn is a function of luminosity .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio of the early types decreases as the local density increases for galaxies brighter than about @xmath142 , but increases for those fainter than about @xmath143 .",
    "we have proposed a model to assign galaxy luminosity and morphology to the dark subhalos directly identified in cosmological n - body simulations . it is assumed that the galaxy luminosity is a monotonic function of its host halo mass . in the @xmath18 model",
    "we assume that the halo masses of early and late type galaxies of equal luminosity have a constant ratio .",
    "another alternative model is the @xmath26 model which assumes the constant luminosity ratio between equal - mass galaxies of different types .",
    "this model has been proposed by @xcite who found that the observed @xmath144band luminosity function of galaxies can be reproduced from the ps function assuming double power - law mass - to - light ratios and derived halo occupation numbers .",
    "it has been expanded by @xcite who adopted the satellite halo mass functions and directly link subhalos to the observed galaxies . in this paper , we have introduced the ratio of luminosity of the early and late morphological type galaxies at a given halo mass , and derived type - specific mass - to - light ratios as a function of subhalo mass . they are used to assign luminosity and morphology to subhalos .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio of the early type galaxies derived in this way has a minimum value of @xmath145 at the scale of @xmath146 in the @xmath60 model .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio starts to exponentionaly increase below @xmath147 and increases in a power law above @xmath147 .",
    "we use the large - scale background galaxy number density as an environmental parameter .",
    "the smooth galaxy density field is obtained by using the adaptive spline kernel which enabled us to resolve crowded regions well .",
    "the local density distribution of the sdss galaxies is well described by the log normal function .",
    "the obtained log normal parameter values indicate that brighter galaxies tend to locate in dense regions .",
    "the local density distribution of the simulated galaxies is quite similar to that of the sdss galaixes in voids and moderate - density regions for both morphological types .",
    "the underestimation of galaxy population in clusters is thought to be due to the evaporation of subhalos by the dynamical friction and tidal stripping .",
    "this can also explain the discrepance in the luminosity function of the early type galaxies in high density regions .",
    "recently , @xcite measured the genus statistic from a large sample of the sdss galaxies and compared it with those of mock galaxies created by the three distinctive methods such as the semi - analytic galaxy formation model applied to the millennium run @xcite , a hydrodynamic simulation , and the subhalo - galaxy correspondence model adopted in this paper .",
    "it was found that the observed topology of large scale structure was best reproduced by the subhalo - galaxy correspondence model even though other models were also consistent with the observation .",
    "however , the observed topology was marginally inconsistent with all simulations in the sense that it showed a strong meatball topology at the significance level of @xmath148 at the scale studied .",
    "the prominence of the isolated high density regions in the observation seems to be due to the sloan great wall which was a dominant structure in the sample analyzed .",
    "we have found an impressive agreement between our simulated galaxies and the sdss galaxies in the dependence of the central velocity dispersion on the local density and luminosity .",
    "the early type galaxies tend to have higher @xmath120 or higher mass in high density regions at a given luminosity when they are brighter than about @xmath142 .",
    "in other words , these bright galaxies tend to become relatively fainter in high density regions at a given halo mass .",
    "this interesting dependence of the mass - to - light ratio on environment was successfully reproduced by our subhalo - galaxy correspondence model of galaxy formation .",
    "a more detailed study of this phenomenon will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
