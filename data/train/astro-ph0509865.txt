    "_ spitzer space telescope _ observations of the bok globule l1014 , previously classified as starless ( parker 1988 ) , discovered an infrared point source with protostellar colors , l1014-irs , located near to the globule s dust emission peak @xcite .",
    "the infrared colors of l1014-irs are consistent with ( i ) a protostar or proto - brown - dwarf in l1014 at @xmath1200 pc ( leung , kutner & mead 1982 ) , as assumed by young et",
    "al.(2004 ) , or ( ii ) an intermediate mass t tauri star ( @xmath5 ) associated with a background cloud in the perseus arm at 2.6 kpc .    assuming that the distance to l1014-irs is 200 pc , its star plus disk luminosity , assuming isotropic emission , is @xmath10.09 , and the best fit to its sed is with a protostar luminosity of 0.025 .",
    "if l1014-irs has the age of a typical class i protostar of @xmath6 yr then it has a substellar mass of only 20 - 45 m@xmath7 ( huard et  al.2005 ) .",
    "however , no spectroscopic observations exist to determine its mass and accretion rate , and so it is unclear whether l1014-irs is a young protostar still acquiring a significant fraction of its final mass , or whether it is destined to remain substellar .",
    "more recent observations strongly support the conclusion that l1014-irs is embedded within l1014 ( crapsi et  al .",
    "2005 ; huard et  al .",
    "2005 ) , however the evidence is still circumstantial .",
    "it has not been shown that l1014-irs has the same local velocity as l1014 , nor has an outflow been detected , despite recent searches using co with single dish telescopes ( visser et  al .",
    "2001 ; craspi et  al .  2005 ) .",
    "in this paper we present submillimeter array ( sma ) observations of co  toward l1014-irs , to search for a compact outflow and to resolve the distance ambiguity .",
    "observations of l1014 near 230 ghz were obtained with the sma ( ho et  al .",
    "2004 ) on 2004 august 15 and september 5 .",
    "zenith opacities at 225 ghz were typically in the range 0.1 - 0.2 .",
    "the observations utilized both 2 ghz wide receiver sidebands , separated by 10 ghz . the sma correlator was configured with high spectral resolution bands of 512 channels over 104 mhz for the ,  and  lines , providing a channel spacing of 0.26 , with a lower resolution of 3.25 mhz / channel over the remainder of each sideband . observations of l1014 were interleaved with the quasars bl lac and j2013 + 370 for gain calibration .",
    "the data were edited and calibrated using the mir software package adapted for the sma .",
    "saturn and uranus were used for passband and flux calibration , respectively .",
    "the flux of bl lac measured on the two days agrees to within 20% , which we take to be the uncertainty in the absolute flux scale .",
    "mapping was performed with the miriad package , resulting in an angular resolution of 12 @xmath8 10 ( natural weighting ) .",
    "the rms sensitivity was @xmath12 mjy for the continuum , using both sidebands ( avoiding the band containing the co line ) , and @xmath10.1 jy beam@xmath4 per channel for the line data .",
    "the primary fwhm beam of the sma is @xmath155@xmath9 at these frequencies .",
    "the systemic velocity of l1014 is 4.2  ( crapsi et  al .  2005 ) . behind l1014",
    "lies another cloud with a velocity near @xmath1040  associated with the perseus arm at 2.6 kpc ( young et  al .",
    "2004 ; crapsi et  al .",
    "emission from the  lines of  and n@xmath11h@xmath12 , and the line of cs , tracing gas density 10@xmath13 @xmath14 , was not detected at these velocities in a @xmath150  beam by crapsi et  al .",
    "no co emission is detected in the sma data over the velocity range [ @xmath1035,@xmath1045 ] , implying that no compact co emission nor outflow is associated with this velocity component to the level of our sensitivity .    a tentative detection of continuum emission of 7 @xmath15 3 mjy was obtained at the position of l1014-irs ( offset by 48 , 01 from the phase center ) with observations made in the compact configuration , but was not confirmed by the extended array observations .",
    "by combining the two data sets and only selecting baseline lengths @xmath16 50 k@xmath17 a similar tentative detection ( 5 @xmath15 2 mjy ) is obtained .",
    "@xcite predict a flux of @xmath11 - 2 mjy at 230 ghz for the central object ( star+disk ) of l1014 , which is consistent with our results .",
    "recent bima imaging at @xmath195 ghz with a @xmath18 synthesised beam shows weak slightly extended emission ( lai et  al .  in preparation ) , but no compact component .",
    "@xcite predict that the emission from a background protostar ( @xmath19 ) would be @xmath1 0.6 jy , which is clearly ruled out by the sma observations , and together with the lack of line emission at @xmath1040  (  [ sec - far ] ) , rules out the possibility that l1014-irs is a distant young star .",
    "co  ( hereafter referred to as co ) emission was detected at velocities blue - shifted and red - shifted with respect to the systemic velocity of l1014 of 4.2 .",
    "no emission was detected at the systemic velocity .",
    "figure  [ fig - maps ] presents an overview of the co emission integrated over the blue- and red - shifted velocities , and fig .",
    "[ fig - pv ] presents a position - velocity ( p - v ) diagram along the main axis of the compact outflow ( indicated on fig .",
    "[ fig - maps](b ) ) .",
    "the co emission is clearly offset from the position of l1014-irs , in a pattern typical of bipolar molecular outflows , with the blue - shifted emission aligned with the near - infrared scattered light nebula ( huard et  al .",
    "two representations of the data are shown . in fig .",
    "[ fig - maps](a ) the data have been tapered with a 3  gaussian in order to improve the sensitivity to the fainter emission seen @xmath20 north and south of the main outflow .",
    "the red - shifted emission to the south is clearly visible even at the highest angular resolution .",
    "these faint extended emission features are approximately equidistant from the position of l1014-irs and may be associated with the outflow , perhaps indicating episodic emission .",
    "[ fig - maps](b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig - pv ] show that the inner bipolar emission is very compact : the peaks have projected separation of @xmath1200 au centered on l1014-irs , the lowest contours are separated by at most @xmath1700 au , and the size of each lobe is only @xmath1540 au ( 0.0026 pc ) in length .",
    "no emission is detected at the cloud systemic velocity , and the peak emission in both the blue and red lobes are offset by similar amounts from the systemic velocity ( fig .",
    "[ fig - pv ] ) .",
    "the red - shifted emission is clearly brighter than the blue - shifted emission by about a factor of two .",
    "the brightness asymmetry might arise because l1014-irs is offset from the density peak , with the red - shifted outflow propagating into denser material resulting in a larger swept up mass , compared to the blue - shifted emission .",
    "the core s column density peak lies @xmath21 to the south ( red - shifted side ) of l1014-irs ( huard et  al .",
    "2005 ) , supporting this conjecture .",
    "alternatively , the difference could be due to radiative transfer effects implying a moderate co opacity ( bally & lada 1983 ) .      in order to derive the outflow properties we only consider the compact outflow shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - maps](b ) .",
    "the nature of the `` extended outflow '' component is unclear , and requires confirmation , perhaps by combining the sma data with single - dish data to recover extended missing flux .",
    "observations with the iram 30-m telescope of the l1014 cloud in co  have recently been made by us .",
    "a full analysis of these data are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , we can investigate qualitatively the missing flux question .",
    "figure  [ fig - compare ] presents a comparison of the sma and 30-m data .",
    "the sma data have been convolved with a 4  beam ( i.e. , the approximate area of the outflow ) , and scaled by the ratio of the beam areas , to approximate the outflow emission detectable by the 30-m in equivalent brightness temperature units .",
    "figures  [ fig - compare](a ) and ( b ) show that no emission and so no missing flux is present at velocities greater than that detected by the sma .",
    "figure  [ fig - compare](c ) indicates that no outflow emission is seen at positions more than @xmath22 from l1014-irs in the 30-m data and so no bright large scale outflow is present .",
    "in fact , there appears to be residual emission ( cloud plus outflow ) detected with the 30-m at the position of l1014-irs some of which could be associated with the sma outflow .",
    "this simple analysis suggests that any missing flux is limited in velocity and extent , and is less than a factor of 3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - compare](c ) ) .",
    "the outflow properties are calculated in the standard manner ( e.g. , cabrit & bertout 1990 ) .",
    "we assume a value for the excitation temperature of 20 k , but values in the range 1050 k modify the outflow calculations only slightly , less than a factor of two .",
    "two methods are typically used to calculate upper and lower limits to the outflow mass . for the lower limit",
    "the emission is assumed to be optically thin , the mass is calculated at each velocity channel and position where outflow emission is observed , and then summed . in the case of the sma observations we are also missing some emission that has been filtered by the interferometer sampling , and so these values are strict lower limits",
    ". however , fig .",
    "[ fig - compare ] suggests that the sma observations do not suffer greatly from this problem . for the upper limits ,",
    "a correction for line opacity is required , but we can not estimate the opacity from our observations as we do not detect  , and the sensitivity of the line observations is insufficient to place any meaningful limits on the ratio of  to  emission .",
    "thus , we derive only a lower limit to the outflow mass of @xmath23 , but note that , if we correct for optical depth using typical values of 2 - 5 ( levreault 1988 ) , then the upper limits to outflow mass and related properties will be correspondingly greater than our lower limits by similar factors .",
    "the mass estimate is consistent with the upper limit of @xmath24  estimated by crapsi et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) from their single - dish data .    for properties relying on a knowledge of the outflow velocity (",
    "momentum @xmath25 , energy @xmath26 , mechanical luminosity @xmath27 , and force @xmath28 ) , lower limits are determined by multiplying the mass in each velocity channel by the relative flow velocity ( to the appropriate power ) of that channel @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the observed flow velocity and @xmath31 is the systemic velocity .",
    "upper limits are found by assuming that the outflowing gas is moving at the maximum observed velocity @xmath32 , rather than the relative flow velocity of the channel , corrected for the outflow inclination . from modeling of",
    "the infrared scattered light nebula huard et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) determine a semi - opening angle of @xmath33 , and an inclination angle @xmath34 .",
    "the correction factor @xmath35 for inclination effects is then negligible ( for @xmath36 ) .",
    "the overlap between the blue and red lobes seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - maps](b ) suggests that @xmath37 is closer to 60  than @xmath38 ( cabrit & bertout ( 1990 ) ) .",
    "regardless of the true value for @xmath37 , if @xmath39 then the correction for inclination is negligible due to the large observed opening angle .",
    "therefore , for the upper limit values we use the observed maximum flow velocity of 3.6  for @xmath32 , assuming no correction is needed for inclination . in this way we find @xmath40  ; @xmath41  km@xmath42 s@xmath43 ; @xmath44 ; and @xmath45  yr@xmath4 . if correction factors for opacity of @xmath46 and missing flux of @xmath46 ( fig .  [ fig - compare ] ) are assumed , then the maximum values for @xmath47 and @xmath28 will increase by about an order of magnitude .",
    "the outflow mass loss rate  can be estimated directly from the mass and age @xmath48 .",
    "typically @xmath49 ( the dynamical time ) is assumed , which may not be reasonable ( parker et  al .",
    "1991 ) ; @xmath50 is a lower limit to the outflow age . assuming @xmath51 yr ( assuming a lobe size of 540 au , see  [ sec - outflow ] ) , and allowing as above for an increase in the mass by @xmath52 due to opacity and missing flux corrections",
    ", we find an upper limit of  @xmath53  yr@xmath4 .",
    "if instead @xmath54 with no correction applied to the mass estimate we obtain  @xmath55  yr@xmath4 .",
    "the values calculated above show that the outflow is of low mass , and correspondingly weak in its momentum , energy , mechanical luminosity , and force , when compared to other outflows ( bontemps et  al .  1996 ; wu et  al.2004 ) .",
    "in fact , l1014-irs is the lowest luminosity source to date with a detectable bipolar molecular outflow , of 292 outflows with well determined bolometric luminosity @xmath56 ( wu et  al .",
    "our data suggests that l1014-irs is not edge on , and so its @xmath56 estimate is reasonable . even allowing for an upward revision of the outflow parameters due to uncertainties in the co opacity and missing flux , the outflow mass is at least an order of magnitude lower than any other outflow ; the lowest previously reported has @xmath57  ( b1-irs ; wu et  al .",
    "the derived values of @xmath56 , @xmath58 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are consistent with extrapolation of the relations among these quantities found for other outflows ( e.g. , wu et  al .",
    "l1014-irs appears to be a weaker version of a typical outflow .",
    "the low values might suggest that the emission is in fact due to bound motions and not outflow emission , so using a size of 540 au and velocity of 3.6  we estimate an interior mass of @xmath14 is required for bound motions , significantly larger than the core mass within the same radius ( @xmath160.5 ; huard et  al .",
    "2005 ) .    for comparison , the outflow from the low luminosity class 0 protostar iram 04191 + 1522 ( @xmath59 cf .",
    "0.09  for l1014-irs ; andre , motte & bacmann 1999 ) is large ( @xmath60 au ) with @xmath61 0.03  ( lee et  al .",
    "2002 from bima data ) and @xmath62  yr@xmath4 ( andre et  al .",
    "1999 ) . unlike l1014-irs , the co outflow from iram 04191",
    "is well detected with the iram 30-m over a larger velocity range , up to 10  from the line center .",
    "the implied accretion rate , which follows directly from @xmath28 , is over two orders of magnitude greater for iram 04191 .",
    "in addition , iram 04191 shows clear evidence for infall in mm transitions of cs and is bright and extended in mm molecular lines such as n@xmath11h@xmath12  ( belloche et  al .",
    "2002 ; crapsi et  al.2005 ) .",
    "so although l1014-irs and iram 04191 have similar low luminosities and are embedded in dense cores , the properties of their outflows and cores show significant differences , which may signify different pathways to formation , and different end results .",
    "its outflow properties suggest that l1014-irs has a low accretion rate for an embedded source , and we can speculate that it is either ( i ) close to finishing its main accretion phase , or ( ii ) its accretion rate is intrinsically low .",
    "either scenario implies that l1014-irs will remain a very low mass object , and it may be the first example of an embedded proto - brown dwarf .",
    "further information , such as a near - infrared spectral classification , is needed to address its evolutionary state and future .",
    "if l1014-irs is indeed a proto - brown - dwarf , then our results suggest that bds can form in a broadly similar manner to low mass stars ( cf . ,",
    "the recent detection of outflowing gas from the young brown dwarf @xmath63 oph 102 by whelan et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) ) , but that there might be significant differences in the details , by comparison with iram 04191 . alternatively the differences between l1014-irs and iram 04191 might simply reflect differences in the mass and evolutionary state from one low - luminosity object to the next .",

    "the results are as follows :    1 .",
    "a low velocity ( @xmath16 4 ) compact bipolar co outflow has been discovered centered on l1014-irs , which directly associates l1014-irs",
