    "solving bound state problems arising in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the key to understand a series of important questions in physics .",
    "the solutions will provide consistent descriptions of the structure of mesons , baryons and also particles with `` exotic '' quanta beyond the scope of the constituent quark model .",
    "one salient challenge is to predict the spin content of the baryons .",
    "furthermore , it could also help to explain the nature of confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "qcd bound states are strong coupling non - perturbative solutions that can not be generated from perturbation theory . among various non - perturbative methods ,",
    "light - front hamiltonian quantization within a basis function approach has shown significant promise by capitalizing on both the advantages of light - front dynamics as well as the recent theoretical and computational achievements in quantum many - body theory .",
    "we begin with an overview of the light - front quantum field theory",
    ". we will then introduce the basis light - front quantized field theory ( blfq ) and its application to bound state problems in quantum field theory .",
    "the idea of quantization on a light - front surface was first considered by paul dirac in 1949 in his famous investigation of forms of relativistic dynamics @xcite .",
    "light - front quantum field theory is quantized on a light - front plane @xmath0 and evolves according to light - front time @xmath1 .",
    "it is convenient to define light - front variables @xmath2 , where @xmath1 is the light - front time , @xmath3 is the longitudinal coordinate . the light - front momentum @xmath4 , where the @xmath5 is the longitudinal momentum and @xmath6 is the light - front energy .",
    "for positive energy states , @xmath5 and @xmath7 are positive",
    ". an important consequence of this is that the light - front vacuum state is trivial @xcite .",
    "let @xmath8 be the generators of the poincar symmetry .",
    "@xmath9 are the equal - time angular momentum and boost generators respectively .",
    "the light - front rotation and boost generators are @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 . according to dirac , in light - front dynamics",
    "the number of kinematic operators of the poincar algebra is maximal : @xmath14 .",
    "the kinematic feature of the the light - front boost generators @xmath15 provides convenience in evaluating matrix elements of certain experimental observables where the initial and final states differ by a boost .",
    "note however that the total angular momentum operator is dynamic in light - front dynamics .",
    "irreducible representations can be identified with mutually commuting operators or compatible operators .",
    "it is customary to take the set of compatible operators as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the pauli - lubanski vector , @xmath18 is the longitudinal projection of the light - front spin @xcite .",
    "note that in relativistic dynamics , the total angular momentum operator @xmath19 is generally different from the total spin operator@xmath20 @xcite . in light - front dynamics , @xmath21 are dynamical .",
    "they have to be diagonalized simultaneously at @xmath22 :    [ soe ] @xmath23    it is conventional to call @xmath24 the `` light - cone hamiltonian '' @xmath25 .",
    "it is convenient to express this light - cone hamiltonian in terms of kinetic energy and potential energy , @xmath26 .",
    "the kinetic energy , @xmath27 , resembles the non - relativistic kinetic energy , @xmath28 where `` @xmath29 '' represents the quark or gluon constituent and @xmath30 is the total transverse center - of - mass ( cm ) momentum while @xmath31 is the longitudinal momentum fraction carried by each constituent .",
    "the triviality of the fock space vacuum provides a strong appeal for the fock space representation of the quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "the fock space expansion of an eigenstate in a plane - wave basis reads , @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 is called the light - front wavefunction ( lfwf ) .",
    "lfwfs are boost - invariant , namely frame independent , following the boost - invariance of the light - cone hamiltonian and the pure kinematic character of the light - front boosts . in practice",
    ", a non - perturbative diagonalization of the hamiltonian can only be achieved in a finite - truncated fock space .",
    "the tamm - dancoff approximation ( tda ) introduces a truncation based on fock sectors .",
    "the rationale of the tda is founded on the success of the constituent quark model , according to which the hadrons can be approximated by a few particles as in the leading fock space representation @xcite . however , there are also new challenges in light - front tda .",
    "fock sector truncation breaks rotational symmetry . as a result ,",
    "the total spin @xmath36 in a truncated calculation is no longer a good quantum number .",
    "basis light - front quantization ( blfq ) is an _ ab inito _",
    "hamiltonian approach to light - front quantum field theory that adopts a complete set of orthonormal single - particle basis functions for field expansions resulting in fock space basis states @xmath37 expressed in terms of these single - particle basis states @xcite . in the fock space basis ,",
    "the hamiltonian and eigenstates become , @xmath38 the system of equations ( [ soe_a ] ) is reformulated as a standard eigenvalue problem , @xmath39 which is then truncated and solved numerically .",
    "the full field theory is restored in the continuum limit and the complete fock sectors limit of the hamiltonian many - body dynamics .    in principle",
    ", the choice of the basis functions is arbitrary but subject to the conditions of completeness and orthonormality .",
    "basis functions preserving the kinematic symmetries can dramatically reduce the dimensionality of the problem for a specific accuracy .",
    "basis functions emulating the correct asymptotic behavior of the solution can accelerate the convergence .",
    "blfq adopts a light - front basis comprised of plane - wave functions in the longitudinal direction and 2d harmonic oscillator ( ho ) functions in the transverse direction .",
    "the transverse ho basis states are generated by the following operator @xcite , @xmath40 where @xmath41 ( at @xmath22 ) is the transverse position operator .",
    "the adoption of the blfq basis exploits known similarity between light - front dynamics and non - relativistic dynamics , and is consistent with the recent development of the ads / qcd @xcite . in momentum space ,",
    "the single - particle basis functions are given in terms of the generalized laguerre polynomials @xmath42 by , @xmath43 which are associated with the ho eigenvalues @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 is the longitudinal momentum fraction",
    ". we can identify the ho energy scale parameter @xmath46 comparing with @xmath47 used in the non - relativistic ho basis @xcite .",
    "the orthonormality of the basis functions reads , @xmath48    to introduce a finite truncation , blfq selects a particular finite subset of the basis space . in the longitudinal direction",
    ", we confine the longitudinal coordinate @xmath49 with _ periodic boundary condition _ for bosons and _ anti - periodic boundary condition _ for fermions .",
    "thus the longitudinal momentum @xmath5 is discretized as , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the length of the longitudinal box .",
    "we omit the zero - modes for the bosons in the calculations that follow . in the transverse direction ,",
    "we select the fock space basis states by , @xmath52 let @xmath53 denote the projection operator for the truncated basis space .",

    "the continuum limit is achieved by taking @xmath57 .",

    "the proof is as following : @xmath61 = 0 \\ ; \\rightarrow \\ ; a { \\left.| \\alpha \\right > } = \\sum_{\\alpha ' } c_{\\alpha ' } \\delta_{n_\\alpha , n_{\\alpha ' } } { \\left.| \\alpha ' \\right > } $ ] .",
    "then @xmath62 = 0 \\\\ \\quad \\rightarrow & \\ ; &   [ \\mathcal{p}h_\\textsc{lc } \\mathcal{p } , \\mathcal{p}a\\mathcal{p } ] = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    among all generators of the poincar symmetry , a complete set of compatible operators ( including the hamiltonian ) is particularly useful for solving eq .",
    "( [ eigenvalue ] ) , as the hamiltonian is block diagonal with respect to the mutual eigenstates . a distinguishing feature of the blfq basis with the finite truncation is that it preserves the set of compatible kinematic operators .",
    "we define @xmath63 . with some effort",
    ", one can show that @xmath64 is a set of mutually commuting operators and @xmath65 = [ j^3 , p_+^\\textsc{ho } ] = [ p_+^\\textsc{cm } , p_+^\\textsc{ho } ] = [ \\j^3 , p_+^\\textsc{ho } ] = 0 $ ] , where @xmath66 .",
    "therefore in the finite basis space the truncated operators , @xmath67 still form a set of compatible operators .    for simplicity , we will omit the projection operator when there is no danger of confusion .",
    "for example , the compatible operators in the finite - truncated basis space will be denoted as , @xmath68 .",
    "the compatible operators allow us to further fix the total longitudinal momentum and the angular momentum projection of the system from the kinematic construction : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the spin projection of the @xmath29-th constituent .",
    "due to the boost invariance , the light - cone hamiltonian depends on the longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath71 instead of @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , for a fixed @xmath51 , the continuum limit is also achieved by taking @xmath73 .",
    "we also take advantage of the internal symmetries to fix the charge @xmath74 , baryon number @xmath75 , color projection and the total color , that is , color configurations are restricted to color - singlet configurations .",
    "let ho states @xmath76 be the mutual eigenstates of @xmath77 and @xmath78 associated with the eigenvalues @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "then the eigenvalue @xmath81 of the light - front spin projection @xmath82 can be expressed in terms of the eigenvalues of @xmath83 and @xmath84 as @xmath85 .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath24 can be identified with the eigenvalues of the compatible operators as @xmath86 .",
    "they can also be identified in terms of @xmath87 as @xmath88 , where @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , the finite blfq basis admits an exact factorization of the center - of - mass motion @xcite .",
    "the light - cone hamiltonian @xmath90 only acts on the intrinsic part of the wavefunction .",
    "so different cm states are degenerate .",
