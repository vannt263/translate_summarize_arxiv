    "in this paper we use a unique spectroscopic sample of @xmath11000 nuv - selected galaxies to derive the first measurement of the 1500 lf between @xmath14 .",
    "we also use hdf data to extend our analysis to @xmath8 .",
    "these results allow us to address the evolution of the luminosity density and sfr , presented in a companion paper ( schiminovich et al .",

    "we use the data collected in the 02hr field ( 02h26m00s,@xmath1930@xmath2000@xmath21 ) by galex and by the virmos vlt deep survey ( vvds ) .",
    "the 02hr field was observed as part of the galex deep imaging survey ( dis ) , with a total integration time of t@xmath22 in two channels ( fuv @xmath11530 and nuv @xmath12310 ) .",
    "we restrict the analysis to the central @xmath23 diameter region of the galex field of view which provides higher uniformity ( morrissey et al .",

    "because of the high source density in these images , the galex data pipeline ( implementing a modified version of sextractor , bertin & arnouts 1996 ) was run with deblending parameters configured to improve extraction of unresolved point sources at the faint limit .",

    "we associate the closest optical counterpart to each uv source .",

    ", we divide the nuv flux among the potential ocs determined using a match reliability statistic based on the likelihood estimator of sutherland and saunders ( 1992 ) .",
    "we find that the average uv flux overestimate is @xmath34 mag in the case of two ocs and up to @xmath35 mag for the more complex cases . by comparing the luminosity functions derived for this blend - corrected nuv selected sample and the original sample , we find that the variations of @xmath36 is less than @xmath37 , within the errorbars quoted below .",
    "this method may be more accurate but still requires several strong assumptions ( optical and uv sources are intrinsically unresolved , optical - uv color is fixed ) .",

    "the high redshift limit ensures that the the 912 break falls below the blue edge of the nuv passband .",
    "we derived restframe fuv absolute magnitudes using k - corrected nuv fluxes ( with k - correction based on sed fits ) .",
    "this choice yields minimal k - corrections because the average wavelength of the nuv passband samples the rest - fuv interval 1050@xmath46 1925 over our adopted redshift range .",
