    "<S> in the light of the `` no - hair '' conjecture , we revisit stable black holes in @xmath0 einstein - yang - mills theory with a negative cosmological constant @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these black holes are endowed with copious amounts of gauge field hair , and we address the question of whether these black holes can be uniquely characterized by their mass and a set of global non - abelian charges defined far from the black hole . for the @xmath2 case , we present numerical evidence that stable black hole configurations are fixed by their mass and two non - abelian charges . for general @xmath3 , we argue that the mass and @xmath4 non - abelian charges are sufficient to characterize large stable black holes , in keeping with the spirit of the `` no - hair '' conjecture , at least in the limit of very large @xmath5 and for a subspace containing stable black holes ( and possibly some unstable ones as well ) . </S>"
