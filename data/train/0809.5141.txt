    "one of the most exciting recent events in physics has been the increasing overlap between two previously disjoint fields , quantum optics and condensed matter physics .",
    "this has become possible due to the enormous progress in cooling dilute bosonic and also fermionic gases down to temperatures where respectively bose - einstein condensation and fermi degeneracy ( temperatures well below the fermi energy ) are reached .",
    "a very attractive feature of this new class of experiments is that they provide the arguably cleanest realization of the ( bosonic ) hubbard model @xcite , which with nearest - neighbor hopping and onsite interaction is the minimal model of strong correlation physics @xcite .    here ,",
    "we describe and analyze numerically a particular setup with ultracold bosons of two species in an optical superlattice , described by a bose - hubbard model . in the limit of strong onsite interactions ,",
    "the system can be described by the spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferro- or ferromagnet , depending on the parameters of the superlattice .",
    "the motivation is fourfold :    \\(i ) in the vein of feynman s idea to simulate quantum systems by other quantum systems @xcite , it would be a great achievement to implement models of magnets like the heisenberg model with ultracold atoms in optical lattices . in condensed matter systems ,",
    "collective magnetism arises from the coulomb interaction and the particle statistics which cause ( super)exchange processes @xcite .",
    "in particular , exchange interactions resulting from second order hopping processes in the fermi - hubbard model dominate its behavior in the limit of strong onsite interaction and are captured by an effective spin model , namely the heisenberg antiferromagnet @xcite .",
    "while collective magnetism has been widely studied in solids over the decades , several experimental restrictions apply quite generally : it is generally far from clear to what extent the typical simplified models are quantitatively realistic , and how to obtain the interaction parameters .",
    "external control of these parameters is very difficult .",
    "moreover , quantum magnetism becomes particularly interesting in low dimensions .",
    "in real effectively low - dimensional solids it is however hard to control or assert the effect of the weaker interactions in the second and/or third dimension .",
    "last but not least , solids give us only access to the linear response regime as sampled e.g.  by neutron scattering .",
    "questions of out - of - equilibrium many - body dynamics are essentially inaccessible .",
    "experiments with ultracold atoms in optical lattices constitute clean and well - tunable manifestations of the bose- or fermi - hubbard model @xcite . to implement magnetic systems",
    ", the most straight forward approach would hence be to use a gas of ultracold fermions .",
    "however , cooling of fermionic gases to the quantum regime is a considerably harder task due to the lack of s - wave scattering among identical fermions @xcite .",
    "hence it is desirable to develop an alternative route via gases of ultracold bosons .",
    "our investigations follow this idea @xcite .",
    "although we focus here on one dimension , analogous setups in higher dimensions @xcite could be used to investigate a plethora of frustrated spin systems that are hard to access analytically and numerically .",
    "\\(ii ) the superlattice structure chosen in our setup ( in analogy to the recent experiments @xcite ) allows in contrast to @xcite for the tuning of the effective spin - spin interaction by changing an alternating scalar potential @xmath0 ; fig  [ fig : systemparameters ] . with the hopping strength @xmath1 and the onsite interaction @xmath2 of the hubbard model ,",
    "the coupling in the corresponding effective spin model is then @xmath3 .",
    "this allows on the one hand to switch for the effective model between the heisenberg ferro- and antiferromagnet . on the other hand one might hope to increase for a fixed onsite interaction @xmath2 the effective coupling , by choosing @xmath4 . in this case",
    ", the relevant physics would become visible at correspondingly higher temperatures .",
    "however , the validity of the effective model breaks down in the vicinity of @xmath4 .",
    "so one has to balance the validity of the heisenberg description and the temperatures needed to observe the quantum effects . to this purpose",
    ", the parameter @xmath0 can be easily varied and used to tune to the heisenberg regime in controlled fashion .",
    "\\(iii ) in recent experiments @xcite by the bloch group , the same optical superlattice as the one discussed here was used .",
    "but its parameters were chosen such that the superlattice decomposed actually into isolated double wells .",
    "the experiments analyzed dynamics in these double wells and contrasted in particular first order ( hopping ) processes ( hubbard regime ) versus slower second order processes ( heisenberg regime ) . the next step would be to observe coherent many - particle dynamics after coupling the double wells .",
    "we analyze such a situation by the time - dependent density matrix renormalization group method ( dmrg ) @xcite .",
    "we focus on the coherent evolution of an initial nel state and the differences between the heisenberg and the hubbard regimes and present the experimentally available observables .",
    "\\(iv ) besides testing the coherence in the experiments , the setup allows to address questions of non - equilibrium many - particle systems , which is in general difficult for all present analytical and numerical methods .",
    "contrary to the setup of isolated double wells , one observes for the many - particle dynamics in our setup a relaxation of local quantities .",
    "this is an indicator for convergence of subsystems with finite real - space extent to a steady state .",
    "recently , the mechanism of how such a relaxation may occur was clarified for ( free ) integrable systems in @xcite .",
    "corresponding examples can also be found in @xcite .",
    "for a few nonintegrable systems the question was analyzed numerically in @xcite and analytically e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "in general one expects that in nonintegrable models , thermalization occurs ( due to scattering processes ) , and that in integrable models , relaxation ( to a nonthermal steady state ) occurs via phase averaging effects @xcite .",
    "this is demonstrated here analytically for the heisenberg model .",
    "our setup could be used to study experimentally such relaxation processes  in particular , the qualitative differences between nonintegrable systems , here the bose - hubbard model , and bethe ansatz integrable models @xcite , here the heisenberg model .",
    "we also fill a certain gap of current literature on such topics ( see e.g.  @xcite ) by emphasizing that the heisenberg spins of the effective model , obtained by the schrieffer - wolff transformation ( in appendix  [ sec : derivation ] ) @xcite , should not be identified directly with the two boson species .",
    "a spin up of the effective model corresponds rather to a particle of species 1 dressed by hole - double - occupancy fluctuations .",
    "the analogy holds only for small @xmath5 .",
    "the consequences for experimentally available observables are surprisingly strong . recently in @xcite a setup of coupled double wells ( @xmath6 , but alternating hopping @xmath7 in fig .",
    "[ fig : systemparameters ] ) was analyzed numerically  in particular , the possibilities to generate entangled pairs of particles were studied . again , a perfect mapping to a spin model was assumed from the outset .",
    "the validity of this mapping is one central topic of our article .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : setupandmodel ] describes the experimental setup and how it can be described by a bose - hubbard model .",
    "restricting to half filling , section  [ sec : effectivemodel ] and appendix  [ sec : derivation ] derive by a schrieffer - wolff transformation for the limit of large onsite interactions an effective model which is the heisenberg antiferro- or ferromagnet . in section",
    "[ sec : evolution ] , we investigate by time - dependent density - matrix renormalization - group ( dmrg ) the evolution of typical observables like magnetization , momentum - space and real - space correlators , where the first two are also available experimentally .",
    "the focus is on contrasting the differences between the full hubbard dynamics and the corresponding effective spin model , and also the differences to the case of isolated double wells @xcite .",
    "we observe indications for ( local ) relaxation to steady states .",
    "this is discussed in section  [ sec : relaxation ] where we also explain how the relaxation for the heisenberg model is connected to a phase averaging effect .",
    "section  [ sec : validity ] addresses in more detail the question why and under what circumstances the effective model is a valid description for the full hubbard hamiltonian , especially for the dynamics . in section  [ sec : groundstates ]",
    "we argue that the groundstate of the heisenberg antiferromagnet could be prepared by tuning an alternating hopping parameter of the superlattice adiabatically .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] gives a short conclusion .",
    "in the following , we present a setup of ultracold bosonic atoms in a one - dimensional optical superlattice that reduces in certain parameter regimes , where first order hopping processes are suppressed , to the heisenberg ferro- or antiferromagnet .",
    "the use of bosons is motivated by the fact that experimentally , access to the low energy quantum physics is at the moment still much harder for fermionic systems . in analogy to the fermionic case ,",
    "for which the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model describes the effective low - energy physics of the fermionic hubbard model , we choose to have two species @xmath8 of bosons in the lattice  two hyperfine states of a bosonic atom . at half filling ( @xmath9 sites , @xmath10 ) , the effective low energy model is , as we will see later , the ferromagnetic heisenberg model . to allow for tuning the effect of first order processes and to switch between a ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regime , we employ an alternating onsite potential @xmath11 and call the two sublattices @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the potential minima differ by a value @xmath14 .",
    "such superlattices can be generated by the superposition of two laser frequencies of ratio @xmath15 , see ref .",
    "@xcite and fig .",
    "[ fig : systemparameters ] .",
    "further , the tight - binding approximation with restriction to the first bloch band ( one wannier function per site ) is assumed .",
    "then the system is described by the two - species bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xmath16 in particular , we choose @xmath17 the superlattice potential is of the form @xmath18 the amplitude @xmath19 of the second potential can be used to tune @xmath0 ; for our purposes , @xmath20 . in it was assumed that hopping from a site @xmath21 to its neighbors @xmath22 occurs with equal amplitude @xmath1 . in principle , the hopping depends exponentially on the distance between the potential minima @xcite . only if we choose the phase difference @xmath23 to vanish as in fig .",
    "[ fig : systemparameters]b , the positions of the potential minima will be equidistant for all @xmath19 , and the wannier wave functions for all sites are reflection symmetric . in this case , the hopping will hence be of equal strength for all bonds , i.e.  @xmath24 in fig .",
    "[ fig : systemparameters ] .",
    "this situation is considered in the following .    for the actual analysis of dynamics in section  [ sec : evolution ] , we will choose equal inter- and intra - species interaction , @xmath25 .",
    "this is at the moment the standard situation for the corresponding experiments . with @xmath25 ,",
    "the effective heisenberg models , describing the second order physics , will turn out to be isotropic .",
    "the onsite potential @xmath0 and interaction @xmath2 can be calculated in harmonic approximation of the lattice potential around its minima . for @xmath26 in ,",
    "the corresponding oscillator frequencies are @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the recoil energy of the laser potential with the shorter wave length . for the dependence of",
    "the onsite potential on the lattice parameters follows @xmath29 in order to achieve an effectively one - dimensional lattice , @xmath30 is superimposed with two transversal laser beam potentials of a ( higher ) amplitude @xmath31 . within the harmonic approximation , and with the s - wave scattering length @xmath32 ,",
    "the resulting onsite interactions for two neighboring sites are @xcite @xmath33 they are in principle not identical .",
    "irrespective of this , the effective spin model derived in section  [ sec : effectivemodel ] would be isotropic and translation invariant . as we will see in the following for a set of realistic experimental parameters",
    ", we have for the case @xmath34 ( @xmath35 @xmath6 ) that @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the onsite potentials @xmath0 considered in our numerical simulations of the hubbard model are from the interval @xmath38 $ ] . according to , @xmath19 will for nonzero @xmath0 hence obey @xmath39 and we can thus use @xmath40 in good approximation .    for the tight - binding approximation to hold",
    ", we need that energies @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 are well below @xmath41 , the energy scale for vibrations of an atom in one minimum of the laser potential . with the hopping @xmath42 @xcite , we have for example with @xmath43 , rubidium atoms ( i.e.  @xmath44 ) , @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( cmp .",
    "e.g.  to @xcite ) that @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "so as long as @xmath0 is also well below @xmath50 , the tight - binding approximation for using the lowest bloch band is valid",
    ". this will be the case in the rest of the paper .",
    "to go to a regime where the physics of the two - species bose - hubbard model reduces to that of a heisenberg magnet , we choose half filling @xmath51 ( @xmath9 is the total number of lattice sites ) and assume the large-@xmath2 limit @xmath52 in this limit , occupation of a single site by more than one boson is energetically unfavorable and will occur only in short lived intermediate states .",
    "this means that single ( first order ) hopping processes are suppressed .",
    "besides some hybridization effects , exactly one boson sits on each lattice site and can be identified with an effective spin on that site ( up and down orientations corresponding each to one of the boson species ) .",
    "the second order hopping processes as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : superexchange ] lead then to nearest neighbor spin - spin interactions .",
    "we will show below , how the effective hamiltonian can be derived by a schrieffer - wolff transformation . while this is a well - known procedure",
    ", there is an interesting twist to the interpretation of the result . for",
    "the moment let us work with the naive identification of spins up and down of the effective model with the two boson species of the full model .",
    "we want to derive an effective hamiltonian describing the physics of the hubbard hamiltonian in the subspace @xmath53 of singly - occupied sites . @xmath54",
    "the effective hamiltonian can be deduced from the following simple recipe : with exactly one spin per site , the onsite interaction is ineffective .",
    "hopping processes occur only in second order , leading to a spin - spin interaction @xmath55 the corresponding coupling strengths @xmath56 and @xmath57 are obtained by dividing for each possible second order process ( fig .",
    "[ fig : superexchange ] ) the product of the transition matrix elements @xmath58 for the hopping to a neighboring site and back by the energy difference @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) to the intermediate state , and adding all such terms that contribute to the same effective spin - spin interaction ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath61 the effective hamiltonian is the xxz model . from now on we specialize to @xmath25 , i.e.  @xmath62 and have hence the isotropic heisenberg ferromagnet for @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) and the isotropic antiferromagnet for @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "note that the effective heisenberg hamiltonian would also be isotropic and translation invariant if the onsite interaction @xmath2 would be different for even and odd sites .",
    "if the hopping would be alternating ( @xmath67 ) , we would obtain the dimerized heisenberg model .",
