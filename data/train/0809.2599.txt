    "while this strange transient behavior had been a mystery for a decade , @xcite and @xcite discovered that it is probably absorption that causes the extreme low - state in this agn .",
    "they found in a 2003 november _ fuse _ observation that the uv spectrum of wpvs 007 had changed dramatically compared with hst observations obtained in 1996 july @xcite : the _ fuse _ observation revealed the emergence of a bal flow .",

    "note , that in the 2005 october to 2007 january data there is an enhanced number of counts at the position of wpvs 007 ( table[xrt_stat ] ) . however , there is no obvious clustering of photons at that position .",
    "therefore we only report a 3@xmath17 upper limit for this time period .    the biggest surprise of the _ swift _",
    "observations is the detection of wpvs  007  at hard x - ray energies . from the whole 85.5 ks data set we detected 24 source photons with energies @xmath02.5 kev out of a total of 36 source photons",
    "this is surprising because during the rass wpvs 007 was * the * agn with the steepest x - ray spectrum ( @xmath33=8.7 ) and with no x - ray photon with energies above 0.5 kev @xcite . during the 10ks",

    "the hardness ratios between the 2005 october to 2007 january observations with the 2007 september indicated a dramatic change in the x - ray spectrum .",
    "while the hardness ratio in the 2005 october to 2007 january observations is soft with hr=@xmath34 which is consistent with the hardness ratio during the 2002 chandra observation ( hr=@xmath35 ) , wpvs 007 had become significantly harder with hr=+0.63@xmath310.20 in the 2007 september observations .",
    "although comparing hardness ratios of different detectors is difficult , x - ray ccds are similar enough to tell if the majority of photons is in the hard or the soft bands .    as listed in table[xrt_stat ] , the total number of source photons in the combined 85 ks _",
    "swift_exposure is only about 36 .",
    "although the number of source photons is small , this photon distribution can be used to examine what spectral model best represents the current low - state x - ray spectrum of wpvs  007 .",
    "figure[wpvs007_xspec ] shows the observed and simulated photon distribution ( black circles and red triangles , respectively ) . for presentation purposes",
    "only the spectrum was rebinned with 3 photons per bin . because only 68% of the total number of photons in the non - background subtracted spectrum are source photons , no spectral fitting of the data is possible . in order to determine what spectral model can represent the observed photon distribution we measured the number of source photons in different energy bands and simulated several models in xspec to reproduce these numbers . in the observed spectrum we found that 12 source photons were at energies e@xmath36 2.0 kev , 24 source photons at e@xmath202.0 kev ( table[xrt_stat ] ) , 16 photons between 2 and 5 kev and 8 photons between 5 and 10 kev .",
    "the spectrum that can reproduce these numbers the best is an absorbed two power law model @xmath37 .",
    "the absorption column density at z=0 was set to the galactic value .",
    "the column densities of the redshifted absorbers are @xmath38 and @xmath39 cm@xmath2 for the first and second power law component , respectively and x - ray spectral slopes @xmath33=8.7 and @xmath33=3.0 for these components .",
    "the first power law spectral slope is that found during the rass @xcite . even though this model can reproduce the observed photon distribution ,",
    "a more physical model is a partial covering absorber with a single power law .",
    "we found that a partial covering absorber with a column density @xmath40 cm@xmath2 and a high covering fraction of @xmath41=0.95 and an x - ray spectral slope @xmath33=1.5 can also represent the observed photon distribution quite well .",
    "figure[wpvs007_xspec ] shows a simulated 85 ks spectrum ( red triangles ) using the partial covering absorber model as described above .",
    "figure[wpvs007_uvot_lc ] displays the uvot light curves in all 6 filters .",
    "note that during some of the observations only the uv filters have been used .",
    "these light curves are similar to those shown in @xcite , but all uvot data have been re - analyzed due to the most recent software and calibration changes @xcite .",
    "wpvs 007 continues to be variable by about 0.3 mag in the uv on timescales of months .",
    "the uv light curves also suggest that over the period of about two years the agn has become fainter by up to 0.5 mag ( see also table[uvot_log ] ) in the uv filters .",
    "because we can finally see hard x - ray photons in wpvs 007 , it is possible to construct the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and derive the optical to x - ray spectral slope @xmath5 .",
    "the photon distribution of wpvs 007 presented here is dominated by the 2007 september observations when it appeared to be brighter compared to the previous observations . taking this into account we measure an optical to x - ray spectral slope @xmath5=2.5 .",
    "this is the @xmath5  of the absorbed / reddened spectrum .",
    "note that @xcite found an unusual reddening curve of wpvs 007 based on the hst data in comparison with hst spectra of mrk 493 and mrk 335 . in order to estimate the unabsorbed @xmath5",
    ", we assumed an optical / uv spectrum of an ( almost ) unabsorbed nls1 .",
    "here we picked the _ swift _",
    "observation of ms 0117 - 28 ( grupe et al .",
    "2008 in prep ) . for the x - ray spectrum we used the unabsorbed power law spectrum found from the partial covering absorber model fit with @xmath33=1.5 .",
    "based on these assumptions we found that the unabsorbed optical to x - ray spectral slope is in the order of @xmath5=1.9 .",
    "the uv spectrum of ms 0117 - 28 can also be used to estimate the approximate intrinsic reddening in wpvs 007 .",
    "we measured a reddening of about 1 magnitude in the uvw2 filter which translates to an intrinsic reddening of @xmath42=0.1 mag .",
    "this sed results in a big - blue - bump luminosity of log @xmath6=37.7 [ w ] which is exactly the eddington luminosity of a @xmath43 @xmath44black hole , or in other words , the eddington ratio is @xmath45 , which is a typical value for nls1s ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we presented new _ swift _  observations on the x - ray transient nls1 wpvs  007 .",
    "we were able to detect the agn in x - rays at a level of 5@xmath32 xrt counts s@xmath16 in the 0.3 - 10.0 kev band which is equivalent to an x - ray flux of 2@xmath1 w m@xmath2 .",
    "the most interesting aspect of this detection is that the majority of source photons are detected at energies @xmath02 kev which is extremely surprising considering that wpvs 007 used to be the agn with the softest x - ray spectrum in the sky , having no photon above 0.5 kev detected during the rass .",
    "compared with the acis - s count rate measured during the 2002 _ chandra _  observation ( @xmath15 acis - s counts s@xmath16 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) this indicates that wpvs 007 has become brighter by a factor of a few .",
    "this variability , however , only occurs in the hard band .",
    "the 0.2 - 2.0 kev flux between the _ chandra _  2002 and _ swift _",
    "2007 observations remains constant within the errors .",
    "the non - variability of the optical spectra seen by @xcite and @xcite suggests that the intrinsic continuum spectrum may not have changed .",
    "this non variability in the optical spectrum is somewhat similar to mrk 335 where the optical spectra taken in 1999 during the x - ray high state and 2007 september during the low - state are identical @xcite .",
    "the non variability of the optical spectrum together with the strong variability seen in x - rays and the uv may suggest that the inclination angle in which we observe the nuclear region is rather high assuming that the variability is a consequence of variable absorption .",
    "this is expected for bal qsos according to the agn geometry model presented by @xcite .",
    "however , this is not exclusive .",
    "recently there have been reports by e.g. @xcite and @xcite of bal qsos with polar outflows .",
    "although the best - fit model is the partial covering absorber model , in principle a reflection model ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) results in a similar shape of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "while it is impossible with the current data set to distinguish betwen the partial covering absorber and refelction models , the presence of a strong absorber in the uv spectrum @xcite makes the partial covering absorber model more plausible as the explanation for the observed _ swift _  x - ray spectrum .",
    "one question is if the x - ray spectrum has changed intrinsically , or whether the absorber has become more transparent sometime between 2002 and 2007 .",
    "the strong uv absorption in the fuse observations also suggests that wpvs 007 was highly absorbed in 2003 november .",
    "there was only one photon found above 2 kev in the _ chandra _",
    "2002 observation , but 24 in the combined _ swift_data . in order to answer the question we simulated a 10 ks acis - s spectrum using the spectral parameters of a partial covering absorber fit derived from the _ swift _  data . using these parameters",
    "we expect to see 13 photons with energies above 2 kev in the _ chandra _  data",
    ". however , only one single photon with @xmath02kev was found .",
    "this is a statistically significant lower value than the expected number of photons .",
    "we performed another simulation assuming a column density of the partial covering absorber of @xmath46 cm@xmath2 and leaving all other spectral parameters at the same values .",
    "this simulation showed that the hard x - ray photons could be suppressed significantly down to one photon above 2 kev in a 10 ks chandra acis - s observations . even though we are dealing with low number photon statistics , the hardness ratios found from the _ swift _  data prior 2007 january observations the chandra 2002 data both indicate a rather soft x - ray spectrum , while the 2007 september data suggest a rather hard spectrum . because the flux during the 2007 september _ swift _",
    "observation is a factor of about 4 higher than during the 2002 _ chandra_observation , it suggests that the column density of the absorber of the high energy spectrum had decreased significantly sometime in the time between 2007 january and september .",
    "this result suggests that the absorber has started to disappear again .",
    "note , that a change in the absorber column density of a fully - covered absorber has exactly the opposite effect on the hardness ratio than what a partial covered absorber does : while in increase of the absorption column density of a fully - covered absorber causes the hardness ratio to become harder , because primarily soft x - ray photons are absorbed , an increase of the absorption column density of a partial covering absorber causes the source to appear softer , because the soft x - ray photons are dominated by the unabsorbed fraction of the x - ray continuum while the hard x - ray photons become suppressed . considering that we observed the flux to decrease significantly between the rass observation in 1990 and the pointed rosat observation in 1993",
    ", we may suggest that we will be able to see wpvs 007 as a bright x - ray nls1 again within the next few years .",
    "the optical to x - ray spectral slope @xmath5=2.5 clearly classifies wpvs 007 as an x - ray weak agn following the definition by @xcite who define x - ray weak agn by @xmath5@xmath472.0 .",
    "the reddening - corrected @xmath5=1.9 is at the borderline .",
    "note that this value has large uncertainties .",
    "nevertheless , this result is consistent with the findings by @xcite that nls1s with outflows seen in the blueshifted emission lines have steeper @xmath5  than nls1s without outflows .",
    "one question remains : why was the x - ray spectral slope during the rass observation so steep ?",
    "an energy index of @xmath33=8.7 as measured from a single absorbed power law model to the rass spectrum @xcite can not be explained by standard accretion disk models .",
    "we can also exclude a tidal disruption event by a star orbiting closely to the central black hole .",
    "first , the optical to x - ray flux ratio during the rass was log @xmath48=0.22  can not be applied to these data because no x - ray photons with @xmath00.5 kev were detected in the rass data making any estimate of @xmath5very uncertain . ] which is typical for a seyfert 1 galaxy @xcite , and second we do not detect any significant changes in the optical spectrum .",
    "this is different than what has been found in the x - ray transient seyfert 2 galaxy ic 3599 @xcite or as recently reported for sdss j095209.56 + 214313.3 by @xcite where strong changes in the optical emission lines were found as a result of an x - ray outburst caused by a dramatic accretion event .",
    "note also that the x - ray to optical flux ratio of ic 3599 during the rass was log @xmath48=1.45 .",
    "one possible explanation for the absence of any photon above 0.5 kev during the rass observation is the presence of an ionized , warm , absorber in the line of sight .",
    "this type of absorber is transparent at soft energies but absorbs at intermediate energies , and therefore provides an efficient mechanism to produce very steep soft x - ray spectra ( e.g. , komossa & meerschweinchen 2000 , done & nayakshin 2007 ) . using _ absori _ within xspec",
    "we simulated a 300s spectrum of wpvs 007 during the rass with an absorber column density @xmath49 cm@xmath2 of the warm absorber with an ionization parameter @xmath50=1000 .",
    "fitting this simulated spectrum with an absorbed single power law model results in @xmath33=6.2@xmath51 , which is similar to what has been found during the rass @xcite .",
    "our detection of wpvs 007 with _ swift _  and the extraction of a photon distribution from the 2005 to 2007 data opens a new window in our understanding of wpvs 007 and x - ray weak agn in general . while in the uv",
    "we were able to follow the increase of the absorber column density @xcite we are now able to follow the disappearance of the absorber in x - rays .",
    "this will need future follow - up observations by _ xmm - newton _  or _ chandra _  and _ swift_. while _ xmm - newton _  or _",
    "chandra _   will be able to obtain a detailed low - state spectrum , _ swift _  will continue monitoring wpvs  007  in order to determine when it will become x - ray bright again .",
    "in addition , optical polarimetry or spectropolarimetry is needed to measure how much of the optical emission is seen directly and how much is scattered ( polarized ) emission .",
    "spectropolarimetry will put strong constraints on the geometry of the agn and will confirm ( or not ) the assumption that wpvs 007 is viewed at a rather high inclination angle .",
    "we also have an approved hst cos observation along with a chandra observation in order to study the developments in the uv absorption lines and in the x - ray continuum .",
    "first we want to thank neil gehrels for approving our too requests and the _ swift _  team for performing the too observations of wpvs 007 and scheduling the agn on a regular basis .",
