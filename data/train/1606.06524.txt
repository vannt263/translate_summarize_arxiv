    "in atoms and ions with complex shell structures , levels are often closely spaced in energy and , thus , difficult to resolve spectroscopically . up to the present , therefore , suitable spectroscopic schemes for resolving the level structure have played important role in studying the structure of atomic systems @xcite .",
    "experimentally , indeed , great effort has been made to improve the resolution of photon detectors @xcite and to obtain ever detailed spectral information .",
    "however , when the level splitting becomes comparable with the ( natural ) width of the transitions , it becomes inherently difficult to resolve both , the sequence as well as the splitting of the energy levels owing to their ( partial ) overlap , even if high - resolution spectroscopy is applied . in this case , an alternative route to identify the sequence and splitting of energy levels becomes highly desirable .    in the past decades ,",
    "much emphasis in atomic spectroscopy has been placed upon the angle - resolved properties of emitted light , such as the angular distribution and linear polarization @xcite . when compared to the total cross sections and decay rates for the photon emission from atoms and ions , angle - resolved measurements were found more sensitive with regard to the details in the electron - electron and electron - photon interactions .",
    "for example , the angular distribution and linear polarization of fluorescence emission were discussed in studying the breit interaction in dielectronic recombination processes @xcite , the hyperfine interaction @xcite in electron - atom collisions as well as the multipole mixing in the interaction of ions with the radiation field @xcite .",
    "however , less attention has been paid to the influence of _ overlapping _ resonances upon the atomic fluorescence , in contrast to the autoionization of inner - shell excited atoms @xcite .",
    "only rather recently , we explored the angular and polarization properties of the emitted photons in the two - step radiative cascade @xmath3 of lithium - like tungsten , which proceeds via such overlapping intermediate resonances @xcite . while , for an initially aligned @xmath4 level , a remarkably strong dependence was obtained for the second - step fluorescence photons upon the splitting of the two ( overlapping ) @xmath5 resonances , no effect was found with regard to the sequence of these resonances due to the mutual cancelation of the sequence - dependent summation terms . in this work",
    ", we therefore study the process of resonant photoexcitation and subsequent fluorescence of atoms to better understand how both , the level sequence and splitting can be made _",
    "visible _ for closely - spaced energy levels . to this end ,",
    "second - order perturbation theory and the density matrix formalism are employed in order to derive and analyze general expressions for the angular distribution and linear polarization of the emitted radiation .",
    "though these expressions are applicable to many - electron atoms ( or ions ) , and are independent of their particular shell structure , we shall consider below the @xmath6 inner - shell photoexcitation and subsequent fluorescence emissions of sodium atom , e.g. , @xmath7 .",
    "for inner - shell excited sodium , the @xmath2 resonances are well isolated from other ( fine - structure ) levels of the @xmath6 excitation and their level splitting is comparable to the ( natural ) widths in the excitation and decay of these resonances .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in the next section , we present general expressions for the ( second - order ) transition amplitude of the photoexcitation and associated radiative decay of the atoms ( or ions ) .",
    "this transition amplitude is then employed to express the angular distribution and linear polarization of the emitted fluorescence photons . in sec .",
    "[ sec.resultsanddiscussion ] , we apply these expressions particularly to the @xmath6 photoexcitation of the @xmath8 levels in neutral sodium and its subsequent radiative decay back to the @xmath9 ground level .",
    "moreover , we later discuss the anisotropy parameter ( angular distribution ) and linear polarization of the fluorescence @xmath1 photon as functions of incident photon energy , i.e. , if the incident radiation is tuned over the @xmath8 overlapping resonances .",

    "this dependence is caused by the non - negligible linewidth of the ( overlapping ) resonances which lead to a coherence transfer in the population of the resonances .",
    "this coherence transfer also affects the angular and polarization properties of the emitted fluorescence light .",
    "we therefore suggest that accurate measurements of the angular distribution and linear polarization of fluorescence light can be utilized to help identify the sequence and splitting of closely - spaced atomic ( or ionic ) energy levels , even if these levels can not be resolved spectroscopically .    with the recent progress of light sources and photon detection techniques ,",
    "the proposed measurements are feasible today .",
    "for example , laser - induced fluorescence spectroscopy or synchrotron radiation can be utilized for such energy - selective measurements of the subsequent fluorescence emission .",
    "in addition , the change of the obtained anisotropy parameter and linear polarization is large enough as functions of the incident photon energy to be measured by using present - day photon detector and polarimeter .",

    "<S> a remarkably strong dependence of the angular distribution and linear polarization of the @xmath1 fluorescence emission is found upon the level sequence and splitting of the intermediate @xmath2 overlapping resonances owing to their finite lifetime ( linewidth ) . </S>",
