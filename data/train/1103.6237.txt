    "several experiments in astrophysics and cosmology , such as direct dark matter searches @xcite and neutrinoless double beta decay @xcite , are based on noble gas and/or liquid time projection chambers ( tpc ) which use electroluminescence for primary ionisation signal amplification .",
    "this technique gives high gains and good energy resolution , and is suitable for experiments with low event rates and high background levels .",
    "up to now , for calculating the light yield and efficiencies , a three - dimensional monte carlo program of the electron drift in xenon and xenon - neon mixtures @xcite and a one - dimensional program for krypton and argon @xcite existed .",
    "although validated , they are not open - source nor freely accessible , unlike the toolkit described in this paper .",
    "our toolkit calculates the yield and efficiencies and provides a versatile and comprehensive parameterisation of the physics processes involved in electroluminescence .",
    "it uses an up - to - date database of electron - atom and electron - molecule cross sections for about 60 gases .    in this paper ,",
    "calculations for neon , argon , krypton and xenon in uniform fields are discussed .",
    "we compare our results with earlier monte carlo simulations @xcite and with experimental data @xcite .",
    "in a gaseous detector , primary electrons are produced along the track of a incoming particle interacting in the absorption region .",
    "they are driven by an electric field , below the scintillation threshold , to a region where , under the influence of stronger fields , they can excite or ionise the gas atoms .",
    "the excited atomic levels are described by the @xmath0 coupling @xcite . in the racah notation ,",
    "e.g. the lowest four excited levels are @xmath1_2^\\mathrm{o}$ ] , @xmath1_1^\\mathrm{o}$ ] , @xmath2_0^\\mathrm{o}$ ] and @xmath2_1^\\mathrm{o}$ ] .",
    "fig .[fig : levels_ar ] shows the level diagram of argon with the stronger dipole - allowed transitions @xcite .",
    "in addition to the transitions shown in fig . [",
    "fig : levels_ar ] , experimental spectra of pure noble gases show a continuum in discharges and in proportional scintillation @xcite due to excimer decay .",
    "excimers  electronically excited molecules , @xmath3  are formed through three - body collisions between an excited atom , @xmath4 , and two atoms in the ground state , @xmath5 :    @xmath6    three - body collisions dominate at pressures above a few tens of torr making the excimer formation the main channel of de - population of excited atoms @xcite . in this paper",
    "we assume that other processes , e. g. associative ionisation which affects highly excited states that are not frequently produced , contribute negligibly @xcite .",
    "the excimers involved are mainly @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "they are formed through process ( [ eq : excimerform ] ) in high vibrational states and can decay to the repulsive ground state , @xmath9 , emitting a vuv photon ,    @xmath10    or they can collide with ground state atoms losing vibrational energy :    @xmath11    in the latter case , the resultant excimer in a low vibrational state , @xmath12 , emits a vuv photon with slightly lower energy :    @xmath13    the electronic transitions of excimers follow the franck - condon principle @xcite . taking into account that the ground state is repulsive , the principle explains the continuum spectra observed experimentally for low pressures ( @xmath14 ) which exhibit two peaks , the `` first continuum '' at higher frequencies - and the `` second continuum '' at lower frequencies .    at high pressures , typically above @xmath15 , the proportional electroluminescence spectra",
    "show only the second continuum because process ( [ eq : vib_relax ] ) dominates over process ( [ eq:1stcont ] ) @xcite .",
    "the simulation toolkit was developed using the new c++ version of the microscopic technique of garfield @xcite , which currently uses magboltz 8.9.3 @xcite .",
    "garfield is a program for the detailed simulation of gaseous detectors @xcite .",
    "its monte carlo microscopic technique tracks electrons in gases at molecular level using procedures and cross - sections available in magboltz .    in noble gases",
    "each collision is classified as elastic , excitation or ionisation .",
    "information about each excited atom is available : the @xmath16 position , the time of production and the excitation level .",
    "this information is used to determine the electroluminescence signal properties .",
    "the program simulates virtually any electric and magnetic field @xcite .",
    "+      magboltz was developed to calculate the transport parameters of electrons drifting in gases under the influence of electric and magnetic fields @xcite .",
