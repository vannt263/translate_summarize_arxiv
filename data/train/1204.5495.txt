    "the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) with r - parity conservation is absolutely stable and can contribute to the present energy density of the universe as a dominant component of cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "if the qcd axion solves the strong cp problem , its fermionic susy partner , _ axino _ , must be considered in the cdm estimate in cosmology .",
    "firstly , it can be a natural candidate for cdm if it is the lsp  @xcite .",
    "second , if the axino is much heavier than the neutralino lsp , still it affects the mass density estimate of the neutralino lsp because the nonthermal decay of axino may dominate the estimate @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is of utmost importance to clarify what is the axino mass in a specific supergravity model . the axino mass is obtained when susy is broken .",
    "a naive guess on the axino mass is of order @xmath4 since the axino mass is the soft term .",
    "but a leading loop corrections can reduce it to @xmath5 .",
    "if this is suppressed , the next level hierarchical masses are arising from the gauge mediation and even some accidental symmetries can reduce it further to @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "in fact , in the literature , axino mass has been considered in a vast mass regions from ev to trans - tev @xcite .",
    "the axino mass depends on two symmetry breakings , the peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry breaking and susy breaking .",
    "the effect of the pq symmetry breaking must introduce a massless axion except from the contribution of the anomaly term and the effect of susy breaking introduces a mass parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the contribution to the axino mass from the parameter @xmath4 is arising by the f - terms while the pq symmetry breaking is given by the vevs of scalar fields . in this paper , we study these two contributions in a most general form , and express the axino mass in terms of @xmath4 with the general khler form .    in global susy models ,",
    "the axion @xmath7 is defined through the peccei - quinn(pq ) transformation for @xmath8 fields @xcite , @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the eigenvalue of the pq charge operator @xmath12 , the vacuum expectation value(vev ) and the phase of @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the pq direction of @xmath11 is @xmath14 .",
    "a prototype axion model with a global susy needs at least three chiral fields , to introduce a vev breaking the pq symmetry @xcite . in this introduction",
    ", we do not introduce susy breaking , but only introduce the pq symmetry and its breaking .",
    "the superpotential having a global pq symmetry is @xmath15 where the pq charges of @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "equation ( [ eq : pqzs1s2 in ] ) has an additional @xmath20-symmetry whose charges are 2 , 0 , and 0 , respectively for @xmath16 , and @xmath17 . to have the standard kinetic energy terms ,",
    "the khler potential is taken as @xmath21 .",
    "then , the potential @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 which is minimized at @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "to show the supertrace ( str ) of @xmath26 , we choose the fields near @xmath27 , @xmath28 where @xmath29 s are scalars and @xmath7 s are pseudoscalars .",
    "the mass matrix for cp even scalars @xmath30 and cp odd scalars @xmath31 are given by the same squared mass matrix , @xmath32 so eigenvalues are given by @xmath33 .",
    "one cp odd scalar should be massless since it is the goldstone boson corresponding to the spontaneously broken pq symmetry .    on the other hand , fermion mass matrix is given by @xmath34 whose eigenvalues are @xmath35 .",
    "supersymmetry is not broken since @xmath36 , so should produce str@xmath37 , @xmath38    in eq .",
    "( [ eq : axinomassin ] ) , the smaller mass is the axino mass , and one of the larger ones is the hypothetical goldstino mass .",
    "this larger one becomes exactly massless when the superhiggs mechanism is operative as will be discussed later .",
    "the superpotential eq .",
    "( [ eq : pqzs1s2 in ] ) can be rewritten in terms of @xmath20 , the superfields @xmath39 , and the axion superfield @xmath40 containing axion @xmath41 ,    @xmath42 the vevs are @xmath43 and @xmath44 . after integrating out @xmath20 , there does not exist low energy self interactions of @xmath45 due to the nonrenormalization theorem .    here",
    "note that the zero mass eigenstates of scalar , pseudoscalar and fermion indicate that they are related by susy transformation and form the axion supermultiplet @xmath45 . in general , the same mass eigenstates of scalar , pseudoscalar and fermion",
    "are not related by supersymmetry transformation and do not form a supermultiplet . for the supermultiplet condition , interactions must be supersymmetric also . in our case , however , the zero mass eigenstates form a supermultiplet @xmath45 which survives down to the low energy scale .",
    "this renders the nonlinear representations for @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which show explicitly the shift symmetry of the axion superfield .",
    "the supersymmetrization of axion models introduces a full axion supermultiplet @xmath45 which contains the pseudoscalar axion @xmath7 , its scalar partner _",
    "saxion _ @xmath48 , and their fermionic partner",
    "axino @xmath49 , @xmath50 where @xmath51 stands for an auxiliary field and @xmath52 for a grassmann coordinate .    in the supersymmetric version of axionic models ,",
    "the interactions of the saxion and the axino with matter are related by supersymmetry to those of the axion .",
    "saxion and axino are better to accompany @xmath7 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : axiondef ] ) to preserve susy . in eq . ( [ eq : axiondef ] ) , @xmath53 is a vev of some real scalar field which is called @xmath54 .",
    "supersymmetrization of @xmath54 needs its pseudoscalar partner @xmath55 , forming a complex scalar @xmath56 .",
    "when the pq symmetry is not broken , the pq charged fields are of the @xmath56 type , its phase changes when the pq transformation is performed , and the fields are the real and the imaginary components of @xmath56 . on the other hand , if it is spontaneously broken , the pq charge is not realized unitarilly but realized in the nambu - goldstone manner , _",
    "i.e. _  the goldstone boson @xmath7 is created , goes up to the phase as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : axiondef ] ) , and the pq symmetry is its shift symmetry . [ the pq symmetry is nonlinearly realized on the action to @xmath7 . ]",
    "a nonzero susy breaking @xmath57-term of the @xmath56 type fields signals the pq symmetry breaking also if it carry pq charges .",
    "therefore , the direction of axion does not necessarily coincide with the direction of axino which is going to be orthogonal to the goldstino which in turn is determined by the f - terms . in this paper",
    ", we define the axion and axino properly , and set up the formulae for the axino mass even in case that a mixing of axino with goldstino is present . here",
    ", the axion component is still defined by the coefficient of @xmath58 term since the f - term or the coefficient of @xmath59 term is auxilliary .",
    "the pq symmetry ( as any global symmetries ) in supersgravity has a meaning if both the superpotential @xmath60 and the khler potential @xmath61 respect the symmetry .",
    "expansion of the khler potential in powers of @xmath62 leads to the following type , @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are sets of holomorphic and anti - holomorphic fields , respectively . from the khler potential",
    ", one can obtain its contribution to @xmath22 as @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the superfields corresponding to @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "consider the leading term beyond the minimal term in @xmath61 , for example @xmath69 .",
    "this must preserve the pq symmetry so that @xmath70 carries the pq charge @xmath71 as the sum of @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "namely , the pq symmetry is also broken by an @xmath57 term , _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath74 of @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "this can be obtained from the superpotential as @xmath76 where @xmath77 . in this case , @xmath78 is obtained in ref .",
    "this example shows that it is sufficient to consider the pq charge carrying scalar components to pick up the axion component , and should not include the pq charge carrying f - terms for a definition of the axion .",
    "otherwise , we double count some components .      in non - supersymmetric case , as axion",
    "is defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : axiondef ] ) , and its property determined by the u(1)@xmath79 symmetry . in the wigner - weyl ( ww ) realization of the pq symmetry , the pq charged fields transform as @xmath80 where @xmath81 . in the nambu - goldstone ( ng ) phase",
    ", there appears a goldstone boson @xmath7 which can be a combination of the original phase fields .",
    "let @xmath7 be in @xmath82 such that in the ww phase it is expanded as @xmath83 in the ng phase , the probability amplitude for @xmath7 to be in the phase of @xmath84 is @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the pq operation on eq .",
    "( [ eq : phiww ] ) is @xmath88    when the pq symmetry is realized in the ng manner by giving @xmath84 its vev @xmath89 , then the charge operator @xmath12 is not unitarilly realized , and then we must use the shift symmetry of the phase fields @xmath7 , instead of the pq symmetry operation @xmath12 , with the original information on the eigenvalues @xmath90 .",
    "so , we apply the infinitesimal shift symmetry on @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , and we use the relation proportional to @xmath94 to code the spontaneous symmetry breaking . for @xmath95 where @xmath53 is determined by the axion - gluon - gluon anomaly term , then by acting the shift operation on @xmath82 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : phiaslinearcom ] ) in the ng phase we obtain @xmath96 as @xmath97 where @xmath98 is @xmath99 which is the probability amplitude for @xmath7 to be in @xmath84 . in @xmath93",
    ", @xmath90 encodes the original degeneracy number of the phase of @xmath84 as the axion field @xmath7 completes one period in the ng phase . representing @xmath100 and @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is in the perpendicular direction to axion s mexican hat valley and has mass proportional to @xmath103 .",
    "since the @xmath104 masses are different , they should belong to different superfields . from this discussion",
    ", we obtain the axion superfield @xmath45 in @xmath105 where @xmath85 is used .",
    "note that we used @xmath106 on both sides in view of fig .",
    "[ fig : dmw ] since the axion shift of @xmath107 is fully accounted for by @xmath106 .",
    "any integer can not be multiplied or divided in the exponent .",
    "note that @xmath108 is composed of two real fields @xmath109 and im@xmath110 , so is @xmath111 , and their vevs are @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "also , @xmath45 is composed of two real fields @xmath48 and @xmath7 , and its vev is vanishing @xmath114 .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]      in the dfsz framework , the su(2)@xmath115u(1)@xmath116 higgs doublets carry pq charges and thus the light quarks are also charged under u(1)@xmath79   @xcite . the charge assignment is shown in table  [ table : pqcharge ] .",
    "so , the superpotential is written as    @xmath117 where @xmath118 . integrating out @xmath119",
    ", we have @xmath120 for the quarks , they do not contain the @xmath56 type fields since they do not contribute to @xmath121 of eq .",

    "this @xmath122 can be removed by redefining the phases of quarks , and we obtain @xmath123 with @xmath124 . equation ( [ eq : dfzssuperpotent ] ) breaks the pq symmetry and the axion coupling to stop is @xmath125 whose coefficient is much smaller than the qcd instanton contribution @xmath126 .",
    "so we can neglect the constant term for the axion mass even though it breaks the pq symmetry . also , the constant term does not contribute to the axino mass . including the susy breaking auxilliary field @xmath127",

    "only the susy breaking soft mass contribution @xmath131 can contribute to the axino mass .",
    "after properly defining the goldstino and axion multiplets , we presented the calculational scheme of the axino mass in the most general framework . for only two light superfields of goldstino and axino",
