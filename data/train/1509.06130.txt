    "earlier i argued @xcite that it is highly desirable to develop a version of the gell - mann  low scheme for the standard model . neglecting important details ,",
    "my argument was that it is not healthy to keep to a unique way of doing something vitally important .",
    "in particular , it is not healthy to take as a unique the  t  hooft - weinberg s way of computing the evolution of the standard model parameters .",
    "( this obvious argument can be pitched highert  hooft - weinberg and gell - mann ",
    "low schemes may result in qualitatively different evolutions of their respective input parameters for the standard model .",
    "@xcite )    i remind the reader that the  t  hooft - weinberg scheme was invented as a technical means to overcome the difficulties of applying the gell - mann  low scheme .",
    "notably , weinberg had given a warning @xcite : mass independent schemes can not be applied to theories with scalar fields .",
    "at least , extra work should be done to make this possible .    within a year",
    "such extra work had been done @xcite : it was demonstrated that the ms - scheme can be used to treat scalar fields . since then the  t  hooft - weinberg approach in conjunction with",
    "the ms - scheme had become the de facto standard for considering the remormalization group evolution of the standard model parameters .",
    "the standard approach is elegant and efficient . but",
    "applying it to theories with scalar fields may be a source of a trouble .",
    "i mean the so - called naturalness problem .",
    "it was pointed out early @xcite that using an uv cutoff instead of uv renormaliztion results in large quantum corrections to the scalar masses proportional to the cutoff .",
    "nothing like this takes place within the ms - scheme .    an explanation to this",
    "was suggested @xcite : dimensional regularization for theories with scalar particles yields feynman integrals contributing to the scalar self - energy with poles in the plane of complex dimension @xmath0 at @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the number of loops in the integral .",
    "this is the way the quadratic divergences manifest themselves within the dimensional regularization .",
    "the minimal subtractions ignore these poles , because they are away from the physical dimension at finite number of loops .",
    "this observation does not mean immediately that the ms - scheme is inapplicable to models with scalar fields .",
    "rather , it justifies in my view the need to try a nonstandard approach for describing the renormalization group evolution of the parameters of the standard model .",
    "i describe below a version of the gell - mann  low scheme applicable in principle to the standard model .",
    "the description is broken into three steps .    first , in the next section ,",
    "i describe how input parameters of the model can be extracted from the connected green s functions of the model .",
    "after that , in section 3 , i express the bare action of the model in terms of the parameters introduced in section 2 .",
    "finally , i describe the expression of the desired green s functions in terms of the above parameters .",
    "the description given below is rather sketchy .",
    "i only give basic formulas without derivation .",
    "some of the derivations are given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "in the most general terms , the gell - mann  low scheme for describing the remormalization group evolution of model parameters consists in the following .",
    "the first ingredient is a prescription on extracting the input parameters of the theory from the green s functions of the theory .",
    "the second ingredient is an algorithm of expressing the green s functions in terms of the input parameters defined previously .",
    "the third and the last ingredient is a derivation of equations for green s functions expressing the independence of green s functions on the way the input parameters were extracted .    in this section",
    "i concentrate on the extraction of input parameters from the green s functions .",
    "it all starts with the propagator matrix : @xmath3 here @xmath4 is a component of the field @xmath5 of the model .",
    "notice the order of the superscripts .",
    "it is to account for the presence of the fermi components ( the matrix @xmath0 is block - diagonal ; the bose block is symmetric , the fermi  anti - symmetric ) .",
    "the field is shifted to achieve @xmath6 .",
    "all the uv counterterms are included , and @xmath0 is uv finite .",
    "next i introduce the inverse propagator matrix @xmath7 . by definition , @xmath8 .",
    "i will also need `` the local part of @xmath9 , '' @xmath10 . to define it , i consider a quadratic form of the fields : @xmath11\\equiv \\frac{1}{2}r^t\\phi\\phi,\\ ] ] and a linear projector , acting in the space of quadratic forms of the fields , @xmath12\\equiv q_l[\\phi]$ ] , where @xmath13 is a `` local part of the quadratic form @xmath14 . ''",
    "i use above and in the the following the condensed notation : @xmath15 .",
    "notice , that the transposed matrix @xmath16 appears in the definition of @xmath13 .",
    "if not the presence of this transposition , the sign of the fermionic part would come out wrong ( see below ) .",
    "the local part of @xmath14 is not defined uniquely .",
    "what i require from it is that the quadratic part of the bare action of the model would be in the image of @xmath17 : @xmath18\\equiv s_{b,2}[\\phi]$ ] , and the dimension of the image of @xmath17 would equal the number of independent parameters in the quadratic part of the bare action .    the local part of the inverse propagator matrix @xmath10 is defined by @xmath19\\equiv r^t_l\\phi\\phi/2 $ ] .",
    "the idea is that the uv infinite parameters in the quadratic part of the bare action can be parametrized with the same number of uv finite parameters in @xmath10 .",
    "now , to make the above consideration more concrete , i give a particular example of a set of projectors @xmath17 satisfying my requirements .",
    "the members of this set are parametrized with a set of field configurations @xmath20 .",
    "the field configurations of this set , @xmath21 , are in one - to - one correspondence with the parameters in the quadratic part of the bare action ( which are related to bare field normalizations and masses ) : @xmath22\\equiv x_{b , i}\\mathcal{o}^i[\\phi]\\ ] ] here @xmath23 $ ] is the basis of local uv finite quadratic operators appearing in the bare action .",
    "let the set of field configurations @xmath20 be such that the matrix @xmath24\\ ] ] is invertible : @xmath25    with these notations , i can define @xmath26\\equiv q[\\bar{\\phi}_j]\\bar{\\mathcal{o}}^j_i(\\{\\bar{\\phi}\\})\\mathcal{o}^i[\\phi].\\ ] ] it can be checked that this @xmath27 is indeed a projector , and that it leaves intact the quadratic form @xmath28 $ ] of eq .",
    "( [ b - action ] ) .",
    "now i define the generating functional of amplitudes . to this end ,",
    "i first define the generating functional of green s functions @xmath29)=n\\int\\mathcal{d}\\phi\\exp(-s_b[\\phi]+ij\\phi).\\ ] ] the normalization @xmath2 is defined by the condition @xmath30 , and the expansion of @xmath31 in the source @xmath32 starts from the quadratic part : @xmath33=-djj/2+\\dots$ ] .",
    "notice that the matrix of the quadratic form is the above @xmath0 .",
    "now i partly subtract from this @xmath31 the quadratic part and define an auxiliary object @xmath34\\equiv w[j]+d_ljj/2 $ ] where @xmath35 ( that is , @xmath36 is the propagator matrix up to the non - local self - energy corrections ) .",
    "at last i define the generating functional of the amplitudes in terms of the auxiliary @xmath37 : @xmath38\\equiv -\\bar{w}[-ir_l\\phi].\\ ] ]    the amplitudes are obtained by partial amputation of the external legs .",
    "indeed , if the propagator matrix would equal the inverse of @xmath10 , the amputation would be complete .",
    "this corresponds to allowing loop corrections in the external legs of the amplitudes in the definition ( [ amplitudes ] ) .",
    "next i define the generating functional of three - particle amplitudes .",
    "it is the part of @xmath39 cubic in the fields , @xmath40=g\\phi\\phi\\phi/6+\\dots$ ] ( @xmath41 is a tensor with three subscripts ) , and the terms denoted by the dots are not less than the fourth order in the fields .",
    "so , the generating functional of the three - particle amplitudes is @xmath42\\equiv g\\phi\\phi\\phi/6 $ ] .",
    "analogously to defining @xmath13 , i define @xmath43 : it is a local part of the three - particle amplitudes @xmath44\\equiv p_3t[\\phi].\\ ] ] @xmath45 is defined in complete analogy with @xmath17 .",
    "the only difference is that it acts on cubic functionals of the fields .",
    "the input parameters of the theory are the parameters in @xmath13 and @xmath43 .",
    "they are respectively quadratic and cubic local functionals of the fields .",
    "the number of input parameters equals the dimension of the image of the projector @xmath46 .",
    "it can also be characterized as the number of independent parameters in the part of the bare action quadratic and cubic in the fields .    what about the quartic couplings in the bare action",
    "? they are not independent parameters of the theory .",
    "it is a remarkable fact : all quartic couplings of the standard model are functions of the cubic and quadratic couplings . for gauge couplings",
    "it is well known . for scalar self - couplings it is less well known bur still true :",
    "quartic scalar self - couplings can be expressed in terms of the cubic ones .",
    "it will be used in the following that the quartic couplings are functions of the cubic and quadratic ones . in particular ,",
    "quartic couplings can be expanded in power series of the cubic couplings , and the expansion starts from the quadratic terms in the cubic couplings .",
    "my next aim is to describe the expansion of the generating functional @xmath40 $ ] in powers of the functional @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "the terms of the expansion will be defined in terms of @xmath43 and @xmath13 .",
    "the first step in this direction is to express the bare action in terms of @xmath40 $ ] and @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "it was noted a long time ago @xcite that there is a duality between the bare action and the generating functional of green s functions ( the dominicis - englert duality ) .",
    "a variation of this idea leads to a sort of feynman rules allowing one to express the bare action in terms of @xmath39 and @xmath13 : @xmath48=q_l[\\phi]-\\log t\\exp\\big(-a[\\phi]\\big).\\ ] ] here @xmath49 is the @xmath49-product : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the variational derivative in the field .",
    "notice , also , that namely @xmath13 defined in ( [ quadratic ] ) appears in the right - hand - side .",
    "the transposition of @xmath9 in this definition is needed to obtain the correct sign by the fermionic part of the first term in the right - hand - side of ( [ de ] ) .    in the above formula ,",
    "bare action is represented as a sum of feynman amplitudes with vertexes @xmath39 and propagators @xmath36 .",
    "a derivation has been discussed previously  @xcite ( this derivation uses its own notations , but all the ideas needed to derive ( [ de ] ) are present in the paper cited ) .    a theory is usually defined in terms of its bare action .",
    "the bare action is defined in its turn in terms of its bare couplings . in the next section",
    "i use an alternative approach .",
    "( i have been referring @xcite to it as the inaction approach because it avoids any use of the bare action . )",
    "the idea is to explicitly use the conditions defining the bare action as conditions on @xmath39 and @xmath36 avoiding any appearance of uv infinite objects in the formalism .",
    "this will be further discussed in the next section .",
    "now i want to discuss the restrictions on the bare action characterizing the standard model .",
    "the key point here is that writing these restrictions is to write conditions on functionals .",
    "it leads to introducing functions of functionals .",
    "functions of fields ( functionals ) is a subject of a separate treatment known as _ functional methods _   @xcite",
    ". functions of functionals mapping them to other functionals is probably deserving a separate consideration , but this is not a subject for this text .",
    "i have already used two linear functions of this sort  the projectors @xmath17 and @xmath45 .",
    "now i need a nonlinear function of this sort .",
    "for this i need to introduce the following notation : @xmath52 $ ] will denote a function @xmath53 of the functional @xmath54 . @xmath52 $ ] is assumed to be a functional itself , that is , @xmath53 maps functionals to functionals    next , i introduce in addition to @xmath17 and @xmath45 two new projectors , @xmath55 and @xmath56 : @xmath57&\\equiv & f[0],\\\\ p_1f[\\phi]&\\equiv & \\big(\\delta_\\phi f[0]\\big)\\phi.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that is , @xmath55 separates the constant term in @xmath54 , while @xmath56 separates the term linear in the field .    at last ,",
    "using the above notations , i can write down conditions on the bare action of the standard model : @xmath58.\\ ] ] this equation states that the quartic self - couplings in the bare action are expressible it terms of the quadratic and cubic self - couplings . as we discused previously , the @xmath53 in the right - hand - side can be expanded in powers of @xmath59 , and the expansions starts from the second power : @xmath60=\\mathcal{o}[[(p_3s_b)^2]].\\ ] ]    in the next section i will demonstrate that conditions ( [ condition ] ) and ( [ expansion ] ) suffice to express @xmath39 in terms of @xmath36 and @xmath43 .",
    "substitution of the representation ( [ de ] ) into condition ( [ condition ] ) gives an equation for the generating functional @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "i call it the inaction equation because it does not involve the action of the theory",
    ". it may be advantageous because all the objects involved in this equation are uv finite .",
    "i discuss in this section an iterative solution to the inaction equation .",
    "the first observation is that @xmath61 solves the equation . indeed , @xmath62 in this case ( free theory ) and the inaction equation is clearly satisfied .",
    "next , i try to solve it in the linear approximation assuming @xmath39 to be small and keeping only terms linear in @xmath39 in the equation : @xmath63=0.\\ ] ]    the projector @xmath64 will enter prominently the following consideration , and i introduce a notation for it : @xmath65 .",
    "so , the projector @xmath66 projects away all the parts of a functional it acts upon if they are not more than cubic in the fields and are proportional to local operators present in the bare action .    for solving ( [ linear ] )",
    ", i notice that @xmath49-operation present in it does not mix the kernel and the image of @xmath66 . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath39 is in the kernel of @xmath66 , @xmath67 @xmath5 .",
    "so , @xmath68 is also in the kernel .",
    "so , in the linear approximation , solution to the inaction equation are in the kernel of @xmath66 .",
    "if i recall the definition of @xmath39 ( [ amplitudes ] ) , i see that the all the solutions are cubic in the fields , @xmath40=p_3a[\\phi]$ ] .    to continue",
    ", it is convenient to use @xmath69 , the inversion of @xmath49 : @xmath70 this @xmath69 also leaves the kernel of @xmath66 intact .",
    "moreover , @xmath71 this means that the image of @xmath72 ( that is , the kernel of @xmath66 ) is mapped by @xmath69 to itself .",
    "i will use this soon .",
    "what i got by this moment is that , in the linear approximation in @xmath39 , @xmath73 ( see the definition ( [ t - part ] ) ) .",
    "now , it is natural to decompose @xmath39 into the part in the image of @xmath45 , and the part in its kernel : @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "notice that , in the linear approximation , @xmath43 is arbitrary vector in the finite - dimensional image of @xmath45 , and @xmath77 vanishes . substituting the above decomposition of @xmath39 into the inaction equation ,",
    "i obtain an equation for @xmath77 : @xmath78.\\ ] ] here @xmath79=\\lambda[[(p_1+p_2+p_3)s_b]]$ ] , and one needs to substitute the right - hand - side of ( [ de ] ) in the argument of @xmath53 instead of @xmath80 .",
    "now i act on both sides of this equation with the operation @xmath81 , recall the property ( [ sandwich ] ) , and obtain @xmath82.\\ ] ] the meaning of this transformation is that now the part of the left - hand - side linear in @xmath83 has become @xmath84    now i separate the part linear in @xmath83 in the left - hand - side of this equation and move the rest to the right - hand - side : @xmath85.\\ ] ] notice that the right - hand side of this equation as a series in @xmath83 starts from the second power because of the property ( [ expansion ] ) .",
    "therefore , i can use this equation to obtain iteratively the expansion of @xmath77 in powers of @xmath43 .",
    "indeed , let me assume that @xmath77 is a function of @xmath43 .",
    "expanding this function in a power series , i start with @xmath86_{(0)}=0 $ ] , which corresponds to the above observation that @xmath61 is a free theory ( here and below the number subscript in parenthesis means that the quantity bearing the subscript is taken with @xmath87 accuracy , that it the powers @xmath88 are dropped ) .",
    "next , i have @xmath89_{(n)}=\\big[-p\\big(t_l+[v]_{(n-1)}+t^{-1}\\log t\\exp\\big(-t_l-[v]_{(n-1)}\\big)\\big)+pt^{-1}\\bar{\\lambda}[[t_l+[v]_{(n-1)}]]\\big]_{(n)}.\\ ] ] notice that in the right - hand - side i have only @xmath86_{(n-1)}$ ] , which is known from the previous iteration .",
    "for example , @xmath86_{(1)}=0 $ ] , and @xmath90_{(2)}=\\big[-p\\big(t_l+t^{-1}\\log t\\exp\\big(-t_l\\big)\\big)+pt^{-1}\\bar{\\lambda}[[t_l]]\\big]_{(2)},\\ ] ] and so on .",
    "it s time to take a deep breath and observe what has been achieved .",
    "in section 2 , input parameters of a theory have been extracted from its green s functions . they are coordinates in a finite - dimensional image of the projector @xmath46 , and the theory is parametrized with a vector of this space .",
    "the theory is defined by fixing this space , and by function @xmath53 appearing in the right - hand - side of ( [ condition ] ) .    in section 4 ,",
    "the part of @xmath39 in the image of @xmath66 ( denoted as @xmath77 ) was expressed as a series in @xmath43 ; the partial sums of this series are defined in terms of @xmath13 and @xmath43 . because the green s functions of the theory can be easily constructed by @xmath77 ,",
    "the generating functional @xmath31 of the green s functions has been defined in this section as a series in the input parameters in @xmath43 ; the coefficients of this series are functions of the parameters in @xmath13 .",
    "a term of a fixed order in @xmath43 is a sum of feynman - like diagrams with the same number of vertexes @xmath43 .",
    "individual diagrams may be uv divergent , but the sum should be finite for a renormalizable theory .",
    "that is , uv counterterms are generated in the course of the iterations described in this section .",
    "the counterterms cubic in the fields are generated by applying the projector @xmath66 , which subtracts local parts of functionals cubic in the fields .",
    "the counterterms quartic in the fields are generated by the function @xmath91 of ( [ almost ] ) .",
    "extraction of the input parameters is to an extent arbitrary .",
    "it is defined as soon as the projectors @xmath17 and @xmath45 are defined .",
    "but theory fixes only the images of these projectors . obviously , there are infinitely many projectors sharing one and the same finite - dimensional image in an infinite - dimensional space .",
    "the arbitrariness of the extraction can be parametrized .",
    "a particular parametrization with a set of field configurations has been demonstrated in section 2 .",
    "the resulting green s functions should be independent of the parameters of the extraction .",
    "this fixes the dependence of the input parameters on the extraction procedure .",
    "consideration of this sort is a source of a new renormalization group equation generalizing the gell - mann  low scheme .",
    "it has been tested @xcite on the example of @xmath92 .",
    "the immediate next problem is to consider the new renormalization group equation for the standard model .",
    "as discussed previously  @xcite , such a consideration can influence the analysis of the naturalness problem .",
    "less immediate , but , probably , even more interesting is the problem of finding extensions of the standard model . here",
    "i suggest to look for an extension of the function @xmath53 of ( [ condition ] ) to the arguments from a space of larger dimension which would still yield a renormalizable theory .",
    "the ambitious hope is that new physical phenomena may be described by such an extension of the standard model .",
