    "one important difference between the h - ingestion rawd models and the vltp or low - z agb models is a result of the wd age and associated compactness .",

    ", the stellar evolution simulation does not indicate the formation of a split of the convection zone and the formation of a separate h - burning driven convection as has been commonly observed in h - ingestion simulations of post - agb and low - z agb stars (  [ s.introduction ] ) .    during the initial phase of the he - shell flash of model",
    "a at @xmath90 , we first observe a very high h - ingestion rate followed by a prolonged period of lower h ingestion , and all of this without split of the he - flash convection zone . if it is confirmed in 3d simulations that no global oscillation of shell h - ingestion ( gosh , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is found in this situation , 1d spherically symmetric simulations of the  nucleosynthesis in rawds are probably more realistic compared to the case of post - agb vltp models and low - z agb models for which 3d stellar hydrodynamics simulations have yet to determine the detailed outcome of the gosh .    at a later time ( @xmath91 )",
    "the h - ingestion rate does increase for a brief period when the convection zone is indeed split . whether or not this particular event is due to the decreasing he - burning luminosity , and how the detailed properties of this event depend on numerical and physics model assumptions is not yet clear .",
    "however , our simulations suggest that there is a distinct possibility of diversity in the convective mixing and nuclear burning interactions in h - ingestion events on degenerate cores .",

    "the initial abundances of some light intershell species , such as @xmath92 , @xmath85 , @xmath93are modified to reflect their intershell abundance due to the progenitor agb evolution .",
    "the mppnp  code dynamically includes up to @xmath94 isotopes as needed and the associated reaction rates from jina reaclib v1.1 @xcite and select other sources @xcite .",
    "we perform simulations for an initial prolonged ingestion ( @xmath95 ) without split with a low ingestion rate ( @xmath96 ) as well as the subsequent shorter event ( @xmath97 ) with a high ingestion rate ( @xmath98 ) that does lead to a convection zone split .",
    "the @xmath99-@xmath100 profile of the he - shell convective zone was taken from model a when the h - ingestion has just begun during the second he - shell flash .    in both simulations a substantial overproduction of mostly first - peak trans - iron elements is found ( fig.[fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "the abundance signature of the short event ( h - ingestion with split ) is very similar to the post - agb he - shell flash simulation that matches the observed abundance distribution in sakurai s object .",
    "the longer event ( without split ) shows even higher overproduction up to 3.5 dex and the abundance distribution is starting to spill over the first peak @xmath101 magic neutron number , generating elements such as mo and ag .",
    "these simulations demonstrate that the ejecta of rawds may be enriched with first - peak heavy elements by 2.5 to 3.5 dex , and that a range of conditions may lead to a certain diversity of local elemental ratios within the  paradigm .",
