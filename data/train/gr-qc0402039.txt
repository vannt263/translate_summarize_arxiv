    "recent observations regarding the evolution of the universe have led several authors to propose a variety of departures from the standard cosmology .",
    "these proposals can be roughly grouped into two categories .",
    "first , there exists a dark energy of unknown nature which is responsible for the accelerating expansion of the universe , ( cf .",
    "@xcite for comprehensive reviews and references ) .",
    "alternatively general relativity requires a modification at cosmological distance scales @xcite ( for a pedagogical review see @xcite ) .",
    "less explored is the idea that the geometry of spacetime is not the so far assumed lorentz geometry ( see for example @xcite ) . due to its simplicity ,",
    "weyl geometry is considered as the most natural candidate for extending the riemannian structure . in this geometry",
    "the covariant derivative of the metric tensor is not zero .",
    "for example , in the spirit of the idea of creation of the universe from quantum fluctuations of `` nothing '' , novello _ et al _ @xcite considered perturbations of the geometry of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the gradient of a scalar field .",
    "other motivations for reconsidering weyl geometry include the hope to remove the cosmological big bang singularity .",
    "weyl geometry can be incorporated a priori in a theory or a posteriori , for example as a consequence of the variational principle involved .",
    "this is the case of the application of the palatini method to gravitational lagrangians of the form @xmath2 @xcite , where it turns out that @xmath3 .",
    "however , the palatini device suffers from serious problems and leads to inconsistencies when applied to general lagrangians for the construction of a gravity theory ( see for example @xcite for a thorough critique of the palatini device ) . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that a consistent way to incorporate an arbitrary connection into the dynamics of a gravity theory is the so - called constrained variational principle .    in this paper",
    "we study homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies in a weyl framework .",
    "more precisely , we explore the field equations derived with the constrained variational principle from the lagrangian @xmath4 under the condition that the geometry be weylian @xcite .",
    "if the matter lagrangian is chosen so that ordinary matter is described by a perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath5 we show that for homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes , the field equations reduce to the einstein equations with a two - fluid source . the first fluid with equation of state @xmath6 ( i.e. stiff matter ) , stems from the weyl vector field and the second fluid describes ordinary matter as mentioned above .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section 2",
    "we express the field equations in terms of the levi - civita connection and show that homogeneous and isotropic models can be interpreted as two - fluid models . in section 3 , following the method of coley and wainwright in @xcite , we write the equations as a two - dimensional dynamical system and analyze the asymptotic behavior of the models . in section 4",
    "we consider the two - fluid model resulting from a modification of the einstein - hilbert lagrangian , cf .",
    "( [ action ] ) , and study the possibility of providing a mechanism of accelerating expansion .",
    "readers unfamiliar with weyl geometry may find in the appendix an exposition of the techniques involved . in this appendix",
    "we also derive the bianchi identities and write the einstein tensor and the bianchi identities in terms of the levi - civita connection .",
    "we recall that a weyl space is a manifold endowed with a metric @xmath7 and a linear symmetric connection @xmath8 which are interrelated via @xmath9 where the 1-form @xmath10 is customarily called weyl covariant vector field ( see the appendix for a full explanation of the notation involved below ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath11 the levi - civita connection of the metric @xmath12    in @xcite it was shown that application of the constrained variational principle to general lagrangians of the form @xmath13 in the context of weyl geometry , yields the field equations obtained via the metric variation in riemannian spaces with a source tensor depending on the weyl vector field . the simplest theory that can be constructed with the constrained variational principle",
    "is obtained from the lagrangian @xmath14 the field equations are ( see @xcite)@xmath15 if we express the tensor @xmath16 in terms of the quantities formed with the levi - civita connection @xmath11 and take into account of ( [ eins ] ) , the field equations become @xmath17 in the case of integrable weyl geometry , i.e. , when @xmath18 the source term is that of a massless scalar field .",
    "taking the divergence of ( [ field1 ] ) and using the bianchi identities ( [ bianf ] ) we conclude that @xmath19    in this paper we will be concerned with spatially homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes .",
    "therefore we have to make the assumption that @xmath20 is hypersurface orthogonal .",
    "that means that @xmath20 is proportional to the unit timelike vector field @xmath21 which is orthogonal to the homogeneous hypersurfaces , @xmath22 formally the field equations ( [ field1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath23 with @xmath24 and we see that the equation of state of the @xmath25fluid corresponds to stiff matter . for spatially homogeneous and isotropic models , the field equations ( [ field2 ] ) become the system of the equations : the friedmann equation is the scale factor , an overdot denotes differentiation with respect to time @xmath26 and units have been chosen so that @xmath27 @xmath28 and the raychaudhuri equation @xmath29 equation ( [ div ] ) becomes @xmath30 which implies that @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a constant .",
    "therefore the energy density and pressure of the @xmath25fluid evolve as @xmath33    in the following we assume that ordinary matter is described by a perfect fluid with energy - momentum tensor , @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the fluid velocity . to preserve the homogeneity and isotropy of the spacetime",
    "it is necessary that @xmath36 therefore we are dealing with a two - fluid model with total energy density and pressure given by @xmath37 respectively , where @xmath38 i.e. , @xmath39 and @xmath40 the field equations take the final form @xmath41   \\label{rayc1}\\\\ \\dot{\\rho}_{1 } &   = -6\\rho_{1}\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\label{cons1}\\\\ \\dot{\\rho}_{2 } &   = -3\\gamma_{2}\\rho_{2}\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}.\\label{cons2}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is well known ( see @xcite ) that the field equations for one fluid can be written as a two - dimensional dynamical system for the hubble variable @xmath42 and the density parameter @xmath43 a drawback of this analysis is that it does not give a complete description of the evolution for closed models .",
    "in fact , at the time of maximum expansion the hubble parameter becomes zero and therefore , the time coordinate defined in @xcite p. 58 , can not be used past the instant of maximum expansion .",
    "instead , we deal with closed models by defining the compactified density parameter _ _ @xmath44 ( see @xcite ) @xmath45 or @xmath46 we see that @xmath47 is bounded at the instant of maximum expansion ( @xmath48 ) and also as @xmath49 in ever - expanding models .",
    "we now adopt the coley and wainwright formalism for a general model with two fluids with variable equations of state ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . assuming that @xmath50 and @xmath51 we define the transition variable @xmath52 $ ] @xmath53 which describes which fluid is dominant dynamically .",
    "the total density parameter @xmath54 can be compactified as in ( [ compadjm ] ) and the evolution equation of the variable @xmath55 is obtained by applying the conservation equation to @xmath56 and @xmath57 defining a new time variable @xmath58 by @xmath59 and with the same kind of manipulations as in @xcite , one obtains the following dynamical system @xmath60 where the constant @xmath61 is @xmath62 in our case , we always have @xmath63    the phase space of the two - dimensional system ( [ 2fluidjm ] ) is the closed rectangle @xmath64   \\times\\left [   -1,1\\right]\\ ] ] in the @xmath65 plane ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "303.ps    .",
    "[ fig1 ]    by inspection we can see that the line segment @xmath66 is an invariant set of ( [ 2fluidjm ] ) .",
    "it consists of three trajectories , the line segment @xmath67 and the equilibrium points @xmath68 and @xmath69 similarly we can specify the following invariant sets .",

    "the equilibrium points customarily denoted as @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 are @xmath70{llll}% f_{1,2}^{+ } : & \\omega=\\pi/4 & \\text{expanding flat model } & \\omega = 1,\\;k=0,\\;h>0\\\\ f_{1,2}^{- } : & \\omega=-\\pi/4 & \\text{contracting flat model } & \\omega = 1,\\;k=0,\\;h<0\\\\ m^{+ } : & \\omega=\\pi/2 & \\text{expanding milne model } & \\omega=0,\\;k=-1,\\;h>0\\\\ m^{- } : & \\omega=-\\pi/2 & \\text{contracting milne model } & \\omega = 0,\\;k=-1,\\;h<0 \\end{array}\\ ] ] and the subscripts indicate which fluid survives .",
    "each of these eight equilibrium points corresponds to an exact solution of the einstein equations .",
    "we shall carry out in some detail the stability analysis of the equilibrium points of ( [ 2fluidjm ] ) in the case @xmath75 corresponding to dust .",
    "it turns out that linearization of ( [ 2fluidjm ] ) is sufficient to determine the global phase portrait of the system .",
    "in fact , the derivative matrix @xmath76 of the vector field of ( [ 2fluidjm ] ) is non - singular and , @xmath77 computed at each of the eight equilibrium points , has two real eigenvalues .",
    "therefore , the hartman - grobman theorem applies in the case of ( [ 2fluidjm ] ) .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath77 computed at all equilibrium points is diagonal .",
    "therefore , we conclude in a straightforward manner that @xmath78 are saddle points , @xmath79 are unstable nodes and @xmath80 are stable nodes .",
    "the phase portrait is shown in figure 2 .",
    "regions iii and iv correspond to expanding models .",
    "the @xmath81 is a past attractor of all models with @xmath82 , i.e. , the evolution near the big bang is approximated by the flat frw model where the weyl fluid dominates .",
    "open models expand indefinitely and the evolution is approximated by the milne universe at late time .",
    "flat models expand indefinitely and the evolution is approximated by the flat frw universe at late time . in both cases",
    "the `` real '' second fluid dominates at late times while the @xmath25fluid becomes insignificant . on the other hand ,",
    "any initially expanding closed model in region iii , however close to @xmath83 , eventually recollapses and the evolution is approximated by the flat frw model where the weyl fluid dominates .    in the case",
    "@xmath84 corresponding to a positive cosmological constant , a new equilibrium point @xmath85 appears , denoted by @xmath86 ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "it corresponds to the einstein static model .",
    "403a.ps    consider for example a closed model in region iii starting close to the @xmath81 model .",
    "its trajectory passes close to the einstein model , indicating a phase of halted expansion and asymptotically approaches the de sitter model @xmath83 .",
    "similarly , an open model in region iv starting close to @xmath81 asymptotically approaches the de sitter model .",
    "this attracting property of the de sitter solution for all expanding models is not restricted only to isotropic cosmology .",
    "in fact , the cosmic no - hair conjecture states that all expanding universe models with a positive cosmological constant , asymptotically approach the de sitter solution ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the weyl fluid has significant contribution only near the cosmological singularities . in expanding models",
    "the `` real '' fluid always dominates at late times and therefore the contribution of the weyl fluid to the total energy - momentum tensor is important only at early times .",
    "the field equations ( [ field1 ] ) constitute the generalization of the einstein equations in a weyl spacetime in the sense that they come from the lagrangian @xmath14 there is however an alternative view , namely that the pair @xmath87 which defines the weyl spacetime also enters into the gravitational theory and therefore , the field @xmath88 must be contained in the lagrangian independently from @xmath89 in the case of integrable weyl geometry , i.e. when @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a scalar field , the pair @xmath92 constitute the set of fundamental geometrical variables .",
    "a simple lagrangian involving this set is given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a constant .",
    "motivations for considering theory ( [ action ] ) see can be found in @xcite ( see also @xcite for a multidimensional approach and @xcite for an extension of ( [ action ] ) to include an exponential potential function of @xmath91 ) . by varying the action corresponding to ( [ action ] ) with respect to both @xmath95 and @xmath91 one obtains @xmath96 note that the second of ( [ nove ] ) comes from the variational procedure while ( [ div ] ) is a consequence of the bianchi identities .    for isotropic cosmologies one can again interpret the source term in ( [ nove ] ) as a perfect fluid with density and pressure given by @xmath97 respectively .",
    "however , if we allow for @xmath94 to be a free parameter , equation ( [ lamd ] ) implies that the energy density and pressure of the @xmath25fluid may take negative values .",
    "an important consequence is that open models ( @xmath98 ) in vacuum with @xmath99 avoid the initial singularity @xcite .    in the following",
    "we assume that @xmath99 and apply again the two - fluid analysis of section 3 . a sufficient negative contribution of the @xmath25fluid to the total energy density and pressure , cf .",
    "( [ rop2 ] ) , may provoke an accelerating expansion of the universe .",
    "in fact , the @xmath100 term in the raychaudhuri equation@xmath101 becomes negative provided that @xmath102 unfortunately , this can not explain the observed acceleration of the universe , as we shall see in a moment .    the friedmann constraint ( [ frie1 ] )",
    "implies that the total density parameter @xmath54 is still non - negative for flat and closed models , but @xmath103 may be negative for open models .",
    "we conclude that @xmath103 can not be compactified as in ( [ compadjm ] ) and the transition variable @xmath55 defined by ( [ tran ] ) is unbounded .",
    "therefore we can not apply the coley and wainwright formalism developed in section 4 .",
    "nevertheless , we can infer about the asymptotic behavior of the system by looking at the original field equations , ( [ frie1])-([cons2 ] ) . from these equations",
    "we see that the state @xmath104 of the system lies on the hypersurface defined by the constraint ( [ frie1 ] ) and the remaining evolution equations can be written as a constrained four - dimensional dynamical system . by standard arguments",
    "one can show that for flat and open models the sign of @xmath105 is invariant ( see for example @xcite ) , therefore an initially expanding universe remains ever expanding .",
    "suppose that @xmath106 at some time @xmath107 then no solution of ( [ rayc1])-([cons2 ] ) exists such that @xmath108 for all @xmath109 in fact , ( [ cons1 ] ) and ( [ cons2 ] ) can be solved to give@xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are constants . since @xmath113 the `` real '' second fluid in an expanding universe eventually dominates .",
    "therefore , the term @xmath114 in ( [ rayc1 ] ) becomes positive at some time @xmath115 and evidently @xmath116 for all @xmath117 we conclude that even if the universe expands initially with acceleration , eventually evolves according to the friedmann cosmology",
    ".    note that for flat and open models there exist solutions without an initial singularity . to see this ,",
    "consider for example @xmath118 and substitute ( [ rhos ] ) into the friedmann equation ( [ frie1 ] ) with @xmath98 . then",
    "( [ frie1 ] ) can be interpreted as describing the motion of a particle with total energy @xmath119 in the effective potential@xmath120    poten1.ps    in figure 4 , we see that motion is impossible for values of the scale factor smaller than some minimum @xmath121 and therefore , @xmath122 for all @xmath123 a similar argument shows that flat models , also avoid the initial singularity , a conclusion already obtained using phase portrait analysis by oliveira _ et al _ @xcite .    to summarize",
    ", the extension to weyl geometry in theory ( [ action ] ) can not explain the observed acceleration of the universe .",
    "since the real fluid dominates at late times , the accelerated expansion due to the weyl fluid is important only at early times .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible that theory ( [ action ] ) could provide a geometric explanation of an inflationary phase present in the early universe .",
    "i am grateful to s cotsakis for reading the manuscript and commenting on this work .",
    "the connection @xmath8 of the weyl space is determined by the symmetric functions @xmath124 where @xmath125 are the levi - civita connection coefficients and the tensor field @xmath126 is given by @xmath127 given a metric and a connection satisfying ( [ weyl ] ) , _ viz . _ @xmath128 then for every differentiable function @xmath129 the metric and the 1-form defined by@xmath130 respectively , also satisfy ( [ weyl ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath131 and @xmath10 are far from unique ; rather @xmath7 belongs to an equivalence class @xmath132   $ ] of metrics and for each @xmath133 , $ ] there exists a unique 1-form @xmath88 such that ( [ weyl ] ) is satisfied .",
    "a particular choice of a pair @xmath87 is called a gauge and ( [ gauge ] ) is a gauge transformation .",
    "the riemann tensor is defined by @xmath134 in contrast to the familiar property in riemannian geometry , in weyl geometry @xmath135 is not antisymmetric in its first two indices ; it satisfies@xmath136 where @xmath137 note that @xmath138 is the same for all derivative operators , for example @xmath139 when first introduced by weyl , @xmath138 was supposed to represent the faraday 2-form .",
    "the relation @xmath140 can be obtained either directly from ( [ riem ] ) , or more quickly by applying on the metric the anticommutativity property of @xmath141:@xmath142 the ricci tensor is defined by @xmath143 and is not a symmetric tensor as we are accustomed to in riemannian geometry ; its antisymmetric part is given by @xmath144   } = h_{\\alpha\\beta}.\\ ] ]",
    "the geometric meaning of ( [ riem1 ] ) is that the measuring units change from point to point ( see @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "in fact , the length @xmath145 of a vector field @xmath146 is not invariant when @xmath146 is parallely translated in a small circuit ; instead , using the standard argument one may show that for a closed circuit enclosing an elementary area @xmath147 the variation of the length is @xmath148 as a consequence , there is an additional loss of synchronization for two initially synchronized clocks following different paths from one point to another , due to the distinct variation of the units of measure along the two paths .",
    "this is the so - called second clock effect @xcite .",
    "when the weyl vector field is the gradient of a scalar function , then the curl @xmath138 vanishes identically and we have the so - called integrable weyl geometry . in that case",
    "the spacetime is not a genuine weyl space , but a conformally equivalent riemann space .",
    "in fact , if @xmath149 where @xmath91 is a scalar field , it is easy to see that it can be gauged away by the conformal transformation @xmath150 and therefore the original space is not a general weyl space , but a riemann space with an undetermined gauge @xcite .",
    "however , most studies of gravity theories were developed in the framework of integrable weyl geometry in which the second clock effect is eliminated @xcite .",
    "we now define the auxiliary operator @xmath160 thus @xmath161commutes with @xmath162 note that @xmath163 is not a derivative operator . for every torsion - free connection",

    "@xcite ) .      it is useful to express the einstein tensor and the bianchi identities in terms of quantities formed with the levi - civita connection , @xmath11 . starting with the definition of the riemann tensor we arrive at@xmath178 where the accent @xmath179 denotes a quantity formed with the levi - civita connection .",
