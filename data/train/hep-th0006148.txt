    "su(2 ) yang - mills - higgs ( ymh ) theory possesses monopole @xcite , multimonopole @xcite , and monopole - antimonopole pair solutions @xcite",
    ". the magnetic charge of these solutions is proportional to their topological charge . while monopole and multimonopole solutions reside in topologically non - trivial sectors , the monopole ",
    "antimonopole pair solution is topologically trivial .",
    "when gravity is coupled to ymh theory , a branch of gravitating monopole solutions emerges smoothly from the monopole solution of flat space @xcite .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath0 , entering the einstein - yang - mills - higgs ( eymh ) equations , is proportional to the gravitational constant @xmath1 and to the square of the higgs vacuum expectation value @xmath2 .",
    "the monopole branch ends at a critical value @xmath3 , beyond which gravity becomes too strong for regular monopole solutions to persist , and collapse to charged black holes is expected @xcite . indeed ,",
    "when the critical value @xmath3 is reached , the gravitating monopole solutions develop a degenerate horizon @xcite , and the exterior space time of the solution corresponds to the one of an extremal reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) black hole with unit magnetic charge @xcite .    beside the fundamental gravitating monopole solution , eymh theory possesses radially excited monopole solutions , not present in flat space @xcite .",
    "these excited solutions also develop a degenerate horizon at some critical value of the coupling constant , but they shrink to zero size in the limit @xmath4 .",
    "rescaling of the solutions reveals , that in this limit the bartnik - mckinnon ( bm ) solutions @xcite of einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) theory are recovered . for the excited solutions",
    "the limit @xmath4 therefore corresponds to the limit of vanishing higgs expectation value , @xmath5 .    in this letter",
    "we investigate how gravity affects the static axially symmetric monopole ",
    "antimonopole pair ( map ) solution of flat space @xcite , and we elucidate , that curved space supports a rich spectrum of map solutions , not present in flat space .    in particular , we show that , with increasing @xmath0 , a branch of gravitating map solutions emerges smoothly from the flat space map solution , and ends at a critical value @xmath6 , when gravity becomes too strong for regular map solutions to persist .",
    "but while the branch of monopole solutions can merge into an extremal rn black hole solution at the critical @xmath0 , there seems to be no neutral black hole solution with degenerate horizon available for the map solutions to merge into .",
    "indeed we find that at @xmath6 a second branch of map solutions emerges , extending back to @xmath7 . along this upper branch",
    "the map solutions shrink to zero size , in the limit @xmath4 , and approach the bm solution with one node ( after rescaling ) .",
    "since the bm solution with one node is related to a branch of map solutions , it immediately suggests itself that the excited bm solutions with @xmath8 nodes are related to branches of excited map solutions .",
    "indeed , constructing the first excited map solution by starting from the bm solution with two nodes , we find , that it represents a map solution , possessing two monopole - antimonopole pairs .",
    "the static axially symmetric map solutions of su(2 ) eymh theory with action @xmath9 ( with yang - mills coupling constant @xmath10 , and vanishing higgs self - coupling ) , are obtained in isotropic coordinates with metric @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are only functions of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the map ansatz reads for the purely magnetic gauge field ( @xmath17 ) @xcite @xmath18 and for the higgs field @xmath19 with @xmath20 matrices ( composed of the standard pauli matrices @xmath21 ) @xmath22 the four gauge field functions @xmath23 and the two higgs field functions @xmath24 depend only on @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we fix the residual gauge degree of freedom @xcite by choosing the gauge condition @xmath25 @xcite .    to obtain regular asymptotically flat solutions with finite energy density we impose at the origin ( @xmath26 ) the boundary conditions @xmath27 on the @xmath28-axis the functions @xmath29 and the derivatives @xmath30 have to vanish , while on the @xmath31-axis the functions @xmath32 and the derivatives @xmath33 have to vanish .",
    "for solutions with vanishing net magnetic charge the gauge potential approaches a pure gauge at infinity .",
    "the corresponding boundary conditions for the fundamental map solution are given by @xcite @xmath34    introducing the dimensionless coordinate @xmath35 and the higgs field @xmath36 , the equations depend only on the coupling constant @xmath0 , @xmath37 .",
    "the mass @xmath38 of the map solutions can be obtained directly from the total energy - momentum `` tensor '' @xmath39 of matter and gravitation , @xmath40 @xcite , or equivalently from @xmath41 , yielding the dimensionless mass @xmath42 .",
    "subject to the above boundary conditions , we solve the equations numerically @xcite . in the limit @xmath4 , the lower branch of gravitating map solutions emerges smoothly from the flat space solution @xcite .",
    "the modulus of the higgs field of these map solutions possesses two zeros , @xmath43 , on the @xmath28-axis , corresponding to the location of the monopole and antimonopole , respectively .    with increasing @xmath0 the monopole and antimonopole move closer to the origin , and the mass @xmath44 of the solutions decreases .",
    "the lower branch of map solutions ends at the critical value @xmath45 . in fig .",
    "[ eps ] we show the energy density @xmath46 of the map solution at @xmath6 .",
    "it possesses maxima on the positive and negative @xmath28-axis close to the locations of the monopole and antimonopole and a saddle point at the origin .",
    "forming a second branch , the map solutions evolve smoothly backwards from @xmath6 to @xmath7 . in the limit @xmath4",
    "the mass @xmath44 diverges on this upper branch , and the locations of the monopole and antimonopole approach the origin , @xmath47 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ z02 ] . at the same time the map solution shrinks to zero .    rescaling the coordinate @xmath48 and the higgs field @xmath49 reveals that the axially symmetric map solutions approach the spherically symmetric @xmath50 bm solution on the upper branch as @xmath4 .",
    "consequently , also the scaled mass @xmath51 of the map solutions tends to the mass of the @xmath50 bm solution , as seen in fig .",
    "[ e ] . on the upper branch the limit @xmath4 thus corresponds to the limit @xmath5 ( with fixed @xmath1 ) .",
    "we note that the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) for the gauge potential includes the spherically symmetric bm ansatz , @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the gauge field function of the bm solution .",
    "anticipating the existence of excited map solutions , linked to the bm solutions with @xmath8 nodes on their upper branches , we construct the first excited map solution , starting from the @xmath54 bm solution .",
    "since the boundary conditions of the @xmath54 bm solution differ from those of the @xmath50 bm solution at infinity , the boundary conditions of the first excited map solution at infinity must be modified accordingly , @xmath55    the upper branch of the first excited map solutions ends at the critical value @xmath56 , from where the lower branch of the excited map solutions evolves smoothly backwards to @xmath7 . as seen in fig.[e ] , in the limit @xmath4 the scaled mass @xmath57 approaches the mass of the @xmath54 bm solution on the upper branch , and the mass of the @xmath50 bm solution on the lower branch .",
    "the modulus of the higgs field of the first excited map solution possesses four zeros , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , located on the @xmath28-axis , representing two monopole - antimonopole pairs .",
    "the locations of the monopole and antimonopole on the positive @xmath28-axis , @xmath60 resp .",
    "@xmath61 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ z02 ] as functions of @xmath0 , together with the node @xmath62 of the fundamental map solution . as @xmath4",
    ", @xmath61 tends to zero on both branches ; in contrast , @xmath60 tends to zero only on the upper branch . on",
    "the lower branch @xmath60 tends to @xmath62 , the location of the monopole of the fundamental map solution .    inspecting the limit @xmath4 for the first excited map solution on the lower branch reveals , that in terms of the radial coordinate @xmath35 , the solution differs from the fundamental map solution on its lower branch only near the origin , where the excited map solution develops a discontinuity . in terms of the coordinate @xmath63 ,",
    "on the other hand , the first excited map solution approaches the @xmath50 bm solution for all values of @xmath64 , except at infinity .",
    "hence , the first excited map solution does not possess a counterpart in flat space .",
    "having constructed the fundamental and the first excited map solutions , we expect , that eymh theory possesses a whole sequence of map solutions , labeled by the number of monopole - antimonopole pairs @xmath8 .",
    "each map solution forms two branches , merging and ending at @xmath65 . in the limit @xmath4 , the upper branch of the @xmath8th map solution always reaches the bartnik - mckinnon solution with @xmath8 nodes , while the lower branch of the @xmath8th map solution always reaches the bartnik - mckinnon solution with @xmath66 nodes , except for @xmath50 , where the flat space map solution is reached in the limit @xmath4 .",
    "we conjecture , that the critical values @xmath65 decrease with @xmath8 , such that , as a function of @xmath0 , the scaled mass @xmath67 assumes a characteristic `` christmas tree '' shape .",
    "thus instead of the single map solution present in flat space , in curved space a whole tower of map solutions appears .",
    "an analogous pattern is encountered for gravitating skyrmions , which are likewise linked to the bm solutions @xcite .",
    "we expect the graviating map solutions to be unstable like the flat space map solution @xcite .    for",
    "the gravitating monopole solutions a regular event horizon can be imposed @xcite , yielding magnetically charged black hole solutions with hair .",
    "likewise for the map solutions of eymh theory a regular event horizon can be imposed , yielding static axially symmetric and neutral black hole solutions with hair @xcite . within the framework of distorted isolated horizons the masses of these black hole solutions",
    "may possibly be simply related to the masses of the corresponding regular solutions @xcite .",
    "it is interesting , that the spherically symmetric bm solutions of eym theory appear in the limit @xmath4 of the axially symmetric map solutions .",
    "but eym theory also possesses static axially symmetric regular solutions , which are not spherically symmetric @xcite .",
    "could these solutions also appear in the @xmath4 limit of more general @xcite gravitating map solutions ?",
    "we conjecture , that eymh theory allows for the existence of map solutions , consisting of pairs of static axially symmetric multimonopoles , where each multimonopole has winding number @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "it is then conceivable that such multimonopole - antimultimonopole solutions will form an analogous set of solutions as the ones encountered above , but with their upper branches reaching axially symmetric eym solutions with winding number @xmath68 in the @xmath4 limit .    but",
    "also flat space should contain further interesting solutions , for instance an antimonopole - monopole - antimonopole system , with the poles located symmetrically with respect to the origin on the @xmath28-axis .",
