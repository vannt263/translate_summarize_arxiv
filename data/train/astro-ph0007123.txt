    "= 10000 = 10000    searches for supermassive black holes ( bhs ) based on spatially resolved kinematics have found @xmath035 candidates ( see kormendy et  al .",
    "2000 for a review ) . almost all",
    "are in weakly active or inactive galaxies .",
    "the reason is that bright active galactic nuclei ( agns ) swamp the light from the surrounding stars and gas , and complicate the kinematic observations .",
    "in addition , agns are rare , so most are distant . even with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) , the central kinematics of galaxies are well enough resolved to reveal bhs only in nearby galaxies . the ironic result",
    "( kormendy & richstone 1995 ) is that the bright seyfert nuclei and quasars that motivate the bh search are conspicuously rare in the dynamical bh census .",
    "reverberation mapping ( blandford & mckee 1982 ; netzer & peterson 1997 ) avoids this problem . in this technique ,",
    "time delays between brightness variations in the continuum and in the broad emission lines are interpreted as the light travel time between the bh and the line - emitting region farther out .",
    "this provides an estimate of the radius @xmath1 of the broad - line region ( blr ) .",
    "we also have a velocity @xmath2 from the fwhm of the emission lines . together , these measure a mass @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the gravitational constant .",
    "an important advantage is that the blr is @xmath0@xmath5 times closer to the bh than the stars and gas that are used in _",
    "hst _ spectroscopy .",
    "however , several authors have pointed out that reverberation mapping yields smaller bh masses at a given bulge luminosity than do dynamical models of spatially resolved kinematics ( e.g. , wandel 1999 ; ho 1999 ) .",
    "that is , in the observed correlation between bh mass and bulge luminosity @xmath6 ( kormendy 1993 ; kormendy & richstone 1995 ) , @xmath7values from reverberation mapping are systematically low ( see figure  1a which shows reverberation masses that are as much as a factor of 40 smaller than predicted by the correlation ) .",
    "this discrepancy is overstated when using the @xmath7 @xmath6 correlation from magorrian  et  al .",
    "those bh masses are based on two - integral models applied to low - resolution data .",
    "comparison with _ hst _ data and three - integral models shows that the magorrian et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) bh masses are high by about a factor of three , mainly due to radially - biased anisotropy in the stellar orbits ( gebhardt  et  al .",
    "2000c ) that was not modeled in magorrian  et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) mass estimates .",
    "nevertheless , even using the best kinematic data , ho ( 1999 ) finds that @xmath7values from reverberation mapping are still low by a factor of @xmath8 compared with masses based on spatially resolved kinematics of different galaxies but similar bulge luminosities .",
    "it is important to resolve this discrepancy .",
    "gebhardt  et  al .",
    "( 2000b ) and ferrarese  & merritt ( 2000 ) find a new correlation between @xmath7and the effective velocity dispersion @xmath9 of the host galaxy .",
    "this relation is significantly tighter than the @xmath7 @xmath6 correlation , consistent with zero intrinsic scatter . in this _ letter _ , we add reverberation mapping masses to the new correlation and find that the systematic offset between the two mass estimators is no longer significant .",
    "ho ( 1999 ) and wandel , peterson , & malkan ( 1999 ) measure @xmath7values for 22 seyfert  1 galaxies using reverberation mapping .",
    "unfortunately , the absorption - line kinematics of these galaxies are not well studied , so we are unable to obtain velocity dispersions for the whole sample .",
    "only seven galaxies have usable published dispersions .",
    "the three sources for these dispersions are nelson  & whittle ( 1995 ) , di  nella  et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and smith , heckman , & illingworth ( 1990 ) .    for most of these galaxies , the velocity dispersions are difficult to measure .",
    "some are late - type galaxies , so template matching is difficult because of the presence of young stars . in many cases , dilution of the stellar absorption lines by the nonstellar continuum of",
    "the agn is a problem .",
    "dilution does not alter the velocity dispersion of the lines , but it does make them hard to detect . ideally , we should use spectral regions that are minimally sensitive to template mismatch and to line dilution .",
    "the calcium infrared triplet near 8500   is preferable to the traditional mg  b @xmath105170 region ( dressler 1984 ) . in the present paper , we adopt velocity dispersions derived from the calcium triplet region whenever possible .",
    "the study of terlevich , daz , & terlevich ( 1990 ) contains three galaxies with reverberation masses ; however , the dispersions measured for many of their other galaxies do not compare well with those from other groups . for example , their dispersions for m33 , m32 , and m31 are significantly different than the accepted values in their apertures : 77  @xmath11  compared with 21  @xmath11  ( kormendy  & mcclure 1993 ) for m33 , 56  @xmath11  compared with @xmath0 80  @xmath11  ( van der marel  et  al .",
    "1994 ) for m32 , and 137  @xmath11  compared with 195  @xmath11  ( van der marel  et  al .",
    "1994 ) for m31 .",
    "therefore we exclude their measurements from our analysis .    for their dispersion estimate , gebhardt  et  al .",
    "( 2000b ) use the projected , luminosity - weighted value inside the half - light or effective radius of the bulge , which we call the effective dispersion and denote by @xmath9 . for the agn sample",
    ", we do not have dispersion profiles and can not perform the same calculation .",
    "consequently , we must use _ central _ dispersions .",
    "however , based on their sizes , these galaxies have bulge half - light radii of only a few arcseconds ( kotilainen , ward , & williger 1993 ; baggett , baggett , & anderson 1998 ) .",
    "these sizes are similar to the typical seeing and extraction window used ( @xmath02 ) .",
    "gebhardt  et  al .",
    "( 2000b ) find that central aperture dispersions measured at this resolution are similar on average to effective dispersions , with a scatter of at most 10% .",
    "thus , the reported dispersion should be a good approximation to the effective dispersion , although a systematic study using the dispersion profile would be worthwhile .",
    "when using central dispersions , the most crucial concern is whether the black hole affects the measured dispersion .",
    "assuming typical stellar mass - to - light ratios , the spheres of influence for these black holes are a few tenths of an arcsecond .",
    "they should have little effect on the dispersions .",
    "the effective dispersion used in gebhardt  et  al .",
    "( 2000b ) assumes edge - on configuration , and since the projected dispersion varies with orientation we must consider whether it needs correction for inclination .",
    "this effect may be more important in agn disk galaxies , where we might expect significant rotation ( a rotating galaxy will have a larger projected dispersion edge - on than face - on ) .",
    "four of the seven galaxies are inclined greater than 45@xmath12  and are likely to have corrections smaller than their uncertainties .",
    "the three galaxies more face - on than 45@xmath12  are mrk590 , ngc4151 , and ngc4593 . based on systems with large bulge fractions ,",
    "even these would have corrections less than 10% ( gebhardt  et  al .",
    "2000b ) ; however , better kinematic data on the bulge rotation profiles for a larger sample of agns is needed before we fully understand inclination corrections .    ho  ( 1999 ) compiled bulge luminosities and bulge - to - total light ratios ( @xmath13 ) from three sources .",
    "kotilainen  et  al .",
    "( 1993 ) provide surface photometry and disk  bulge decompositions for 3c120 , mrk590 , ngc3227 , ngc4151 , and ngc4593 ; granato  et  al .",
    "( 1993 ) provide disk ",
    "bulge decompositions for mrk590 and ngc3516 ; while baggett  et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) give profiles and decompositions for ngc3227 , ngc4051 , ngc4151 , and ngc4593 .",
    "for the galaxies that overlap among the various groups , we find consistent @xmath13 values .",
    "however , each study uses a de  vaucouleurs profile for the bulge component . if these bulges are more nearly exponential or if the agn contributes significant light unaccounted for , then the bulge light will have been overestimated .",
    "table  1 lists the data we have discussed , and figure  1 plots @xmath7versus the bulge luminosity and effective dispersion @xmath9 .",
    "the masses from resolved kinematics and the associated least - squares fits come from gebhardt  et  al .",
    "( 2000b ) .",
    "the relation fitted only to the galaxies with spatially resolved kinematics for the @xmath7 @xmath9 correlation is @xmath7@xmath14 .",
    "the reverberation masses lie a factor of 510 too low in the luminosity plot ( black dots ) , but are much more consistent with the correlation in the @xmath9 plot . in the @xmath9 relation ,",
    "the reverberation mapping masses have an average offset of @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) dex and a dispersion of 0.34 dex relative to that average .",
    "the scatter ( 0.30 dex in log@xmath7 at fixed dispersion ) is the same regardless of whether or not we include the reverberation mapping masses in the fit , but the slope changes from 3.75 to 3.90 if we include them .",
    "the average uncertainties in m@xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath9 for the reverberation mapping estimates are shown in the bottom corner in fig .  1 .",
    "unfortunately , the uncertainties in reverberation mapping are dominated by systematics that are uncertain or unknown ( wandel  et  al .  1999 ) and can be quite large .",
    "since we have only seven reverberation mapping masses , we do not attempt a rigorous statistical analysis including the measurement uncertainties .",

    "the apparent discrepancy between reverberation mapping and dynamical modeling of spatially resolved kinematics arose from a comparison of @xmath7with bulge luminosities . since the reverberation mapping masses are consistent with the correlation and not with the @xmath7 @xmath6 correlation , the discrepancy in the latter is likely due to problems with the use of bulge luminosities , not with estimation of the bh masses .",
    "velocity dispersions are more difficult to measure in agns , but we have little reason to suspect that they have systematic errors .    however , it is important to examine the potential complications of both techniques .",
    "sections 3.1 and 3.2 below suggest that the bh masses from resolved stellar kinematics have only small systematic errors but that the bh masses from reverberation mapping may be biased slightly low .",
    "\\(1 ) model limitations were once a concern but are now under control .",
    "the current state of the art is to use schwarzschild s method ( schwarzschild 1979 ; richstone & tremaine 1988 ) to construct three - integral models that include galaxy flattening and velocity anisotropy ( van der marel  et  al .",
    "1998 ; gebhardt et  al .",
    "2000a ; richstone  et  al .",
    "the galaxies with stellar kinematical masses in figure 1a , b all have three - integral models .",
    "when such models are fitted to _ hst _",
    "data , the errors in @xmath7 are small",
    ". however , there is still some concern about whether non - axisymmetric structure affects the masses , and thorough comparisons of the different modeling codes have not yet been carried out .",
    "\\(2 ) selection effects may be present since early bh searches were biased toward objects with unusually high bh masses ( the first _",
    "targets were galaxies that showed high central dispersions at ground - based resolution ) .",
    "this bias still persists in the current overall bh census based on stellar - dynamical measurements , but the present sample is large enough to overcome effects from a few galaxies with high bh masses .",
    "\\(3 ) it is possible that galaxies contain central concentrations of ordinary dark matter ( e.g. , stellar remnants ) that are included in most bh mass measurements .",
    "this concern is prompted by the fact that the radii that we resolve with _ hst _ spectroscopy are @xmath25 larger than the blr that is used in reverberation mapping .",
    "however , measurements in our galaxy ( genzel  et  al .  1997 , 2000 ;",
    "ghez  et  al .",
    "1998 ) and in ngc4258 ( greenhill  et  al .  1996 ) probe a small region comparable to that probed by reverberation mapping in other galaxies , and find no suggestion of any dark mass in addition to a bh .",
    "\\(1 ) the geometry and orbital distribution of the blr are poorly known .",
    "if , as is often assumed in the agn unification model ( antonucci 1993 ) , seyfert  1 nuclei are viewed preferentially face on and if the blr and the obscuring tori are roughly coplanar , then the inclination correction for reverberation masses would be significant .",
    "however , because the thickness of the blr disk is unknown , the actual correction is uncertain . nonetheless , if the corrections are factors around 2 , then the comparison of these masses in fig .",
    "1b will improve .",
    "\\(2 ) the measured `` lag '' in reverberation studies is a peculiar moment over the distribution of distances between the central nucleus and the line - emitting gas , and the measured line width is a different peculiar moment over the velocity distribution .",
    "these are affected by the adopted weightings , the shape of the continuum fluctuation power spectrum , and the sampling of the monitoring .",
    "\\(3 ) selection effects restrict the bh masses that are currently measurable by reverberation mapping .",
    "the timescales of agn variability scale with luminosity ( e.g. , netzer & peterson 1997 ) and presumably with mass for eddington - limited systems .",
    "ongoing studies of slowly - varying , high - luminosity agns ( kaspi et  al .",
    "2000 ) and of rapidly - varying , low - luminosity agns ( peterson et  al .",
    "2000 ) should remedy this situation in the future .",
    "( 4 ) it is important to consider non - gravitational effects acting on blr gas . they include radial motions caused by radiation pressure or by mechanical energy from jets . the resulting mass measurement errors could have either sign , but it is most likely that we would overestimate @xmath7 ( krolik 1997 ) .",
    "the following are additional complications that arise when estimating bulge luminosities .",
    "\\(5 ) agns are commonly associated with starbursts ( e.g. , heckman 1999 ; sanders 1999 ) .",
    "this may cause @xmath7 to look too small in the @xmath7 ",
    "@xmath6 correlation .",
    "although @xmath7 is plotted against blue luminosity , the physical correlation is presumably with bulge mass , and star formation can easily reduce @xmath26 by a factor of 2  4 compared to its value in bulges that are made of old stars",
    ". then the bulge would look too bright for the given @xmath7 .",
    "\\(6 ) it is possible that the light from the agn biases the estimate of the bulge light",
    ". first , the agn makes the center of the galaxy look exceptionally bright in poor - quality images , so there is a tendency to assign a hubble type that is too early if using qualitative visual inspection . if one then uses the loose correlation between hubble type and bulge - to - disk ratio ( simien & de vaucouleurs 1986 ) to estimate bulge luminosities , they will be overestimated .",
    "second , even if one uses disk / bulge decompositions , unless the agn is modeled separately , it will likely cause an overestimate of the bulge light as well .",
    "we have shown that masses derived from reverberation mapping are consistent with the relation between bh mass and galaxy velocity dispersion derived from spatially resolved kinematics . based on a sample of seven seyfert galaxies , we find that the systematic and random errors in bh masses determined from reverberation mapping are around 0.21 dex and 0.34 dex , respectively .",
    "it is remarkable that , despite the large number of possible systematic biases ( especially in reverberation mapping ) , both methods appear to provide consistent and reliable estimators of bh masses .",
    "peterson & wandel ( 2000 ) provide further support of the reliability for the agn mass estimates by showing a keplerian relation between line width and time lag .",
    "one could even use the @xmath27 correlation to infer properties of the broad - line region ; for example , any differences in the agn masses compared with the correlation may provide insight into the blr geometry .    the fact that reverberation mapping successfully delivers bh masses offers tremendous hope of getting bh masses in objects that otherwise would not be accessible , namely bright agns , including qsos ( e.g. , kaspi  et  al .",
    "2000 ) , and high - redshift agns .",
    "the latter hold some hope of probing the time evolution ( growth history ) of bh mass ( e.g. , wandel 1999 ) . furthermore , the correlation between photoionization and reverberation models ( wandel  et  al .",
    "1999 ) offers the possibility of wholesale agn mass estimates .",
    "future studies aimed at comparing the two mass estimators on the _ same _ galaxies are required to confirm both techniques , but the present results are encouraging .",
