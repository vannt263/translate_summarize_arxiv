    "the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) will soon be reactivated after the year 2008 accident to uncover the mystery of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "the ultimate goal of the lhc is to search for the higgs boson and hopefully any new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "many grand - unified theories , extra - dimensional models as well as string - inspired models predict additional @xmath4 gauge groups in addition to the sm hypercharge @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , at least one extra heavy neutral gauge boson @xmath6 is generally expected in these theories .",
    "there have been many studies of @xmath1 bosons at colliders @xcite .",
    "the most direct channel to probe the existence of @xmath1 boson is the drell - yan process , which will be identified unambiguously by a new resonance peak in the invariant mass distribution of the electron - positron or muon - antimuon pairs .",
    "the current best limit of this search is from the tevatron @xcite .",
    "the lower mass limits of a few popular @xmath1 models range from @xmath7 tev .",
    "one can also measure the branching ratios of the @xmath1 to differentiate the underlying models , as was studied recently in ref .",
    "@xcite . at the lhc",
    ", it has been shown that one can probe a @xmath1 boson up to about a few tev .",
    "thus , if the @xmath1 boson is above a few tev or has suppressed couplings to electrons and muons , the lhc may not be able to identify its presence easily .",
    "in this work , we use the longitudinal vector boson scattering @xcite to probe the gauge sector .",
    "we show that if the sm @xmath0 boson mixes with a heavy enough @xmath1 boson of any origin such that the gauge coupling of the sm @xmath0 boson to a pair of @xmath8 is modified , the longitudinal vector boson scattering will show an appreciable rise in scattering cross sections .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "consider the sm first for the channel @xmath9 .",
    "besides the contributions from the @xmath10 , and the higgs exchange diagrams , there is also the 4-point contact interaction diagram . recall that at the asymptotically high energy limit , the longitudinal polarization @xmath11 for the @xmath12 boson behaves like @xmath13",
    "therefore , naively the 4-point diagram goes like @xmath14 as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the center - of - mass ( cm ) energy .",
    "such bad energy - growing terms will be offset , however , by similar terms from the pure gauge diagrams with @xmath17 and @xmath0 exchanges , leaving behind those @xmath18 terms , which will eventually be cancelled by the higgs diagrams .",
    "only the @xmath19 terms survive and unitarity is guaranteed in the sm .",
    "in a recent work by three of the authors @xcite , we show that in extended higgs models if the light higgs boson has a reduced coupling @xmath20 and the heavy higgs boson is heavy enough , there will be a wide energy range in which the longitudinal vector boson scattering becomes strong and detectable at the lhc .",
    "the general two - higgs - doublet model is an example of such a scenario .",
    "the energy - growing terms of order @xmath18 exist and cause the rising of the scattering cross sections between the mass scales of light and heavy higgs bosons . in the present work , we show even more spectacular rising in the scattering cross section due to a modified @xmath21 coupling such that the energy - growing terms are effectively of order @xmath14 .",
    "the modified coupling @xmath21 arises from the mixing between the sm @xmath0 boson and an extra @xmath1 boson of some origin .",
    "the mixing can be of the kinetic type @xcite or the stueckelberg type @xcite or the combination of both @xcite .",
    "we shall consider mainly the stueckelberg model and comment briefly on the kinetic mixing and a few other types of @xmath1 models .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the stueckelberg @xmath1 model and how the mixing could lead to the modified trilinear and quartic gauge couplings as well as the gauge - higgs couplings which are relevant to the @xmath22 scatterings .",
    "we also work out a mass relation between @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath12 arising from the custodial symmetry of the model .",
    "this mass relation is crucial for the restoration of unitarity at very high energy in the @xmath23 scattering amplitudes . in sec .",
    "iii , we first remind the readers of some details about various contributions to the scattering amplitude of @xmath24 in the sm .",
    "the exact scattering amplitude for @xmath24 with modified couplings in the stueckelberg @xmath1 model as well as its high energy limits will be presented .",
    "we present our numerical results in sec .",
    "iv and conclude in sec .  v.",
    "the stueckelberg extension of the sm ( stsm ) @xcite is obtained by adding a hidden sector associated with an extra @xmath25 interaction , under which the sm particles are neutral .",
    "assuming there is no kinetic mixing between the two @xmath4 s , the lagrangian describing the system is @xmath26 , with @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are the field strength tensors of the gauge fields @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , respectively ; @xmath34 denotes a sm fermion , while @xmath35 is a dirac fermion in the hidden sector which may play a role as milli - charged dark matter in the universe @xcite and @xmath36 is its mass ; @xmath37 is the sm higgs doublet ; and @xmath38 is the stueckelberg axion scalar .",

    ", we have @xmath71 the custodial su(2 ) symmetry protects the following tree level symmetry breaking mass relation @xmath72 from receiving large radiative corrections .",
    "the above mass relation is essential for the cancellation of the bad @xmath73 terms in the @xmath8 scattering amplitude in order to maintain unitarity at high energy . in stsm ,",
    "a similar mass relation among @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 exists in order to tame the bad high energy terms and it is given by @xmath77 in the custodial symmetry limit of @xmath78 , it is easy to show that @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",

    "the mass relation eq .",

    "the deviation of @xmath113 from @xmath114 is checked to be of @xmath115 .",
    "we further check other quantities like @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 defined in the pdg , and they all present an @xmath115 modification compared to their sm values which are tolerable for the tree level calculation ( see table [ zdecays ] ) .",
    "we note that the quantity @xmath124 is very sensitive to the values of @xmath125 in different schemes , and so we ignore @xmath124 in our tree level treatment .",
    ".quantities in @xmath0 decays .",
    "the experimental data are in the second column , while the sm and the stsm of the tree - level calculation are in the third and fourth columns , respectively .",
    "[ zdecays ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table  [ eventrates ] , we present the event rates for the various longitudinal weak gauge boson scattering processes at the lhc for the stsm with the same parameter choices as in the previous figures . here , as well as in previous figures ,",
    "we have imposed the kinematic cut @xmath126 at the parton rest frame .",
    "the sm results are also shown for comparison .",
    "as one can see , the rise for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 channels are discernible for the large @xmath84 scenario .",
    "in models with an additional heavy neutral gauge boson , modifications of the trilinear and quartic pure gauge couplings and the gauge - higgs couplings are possible through the mixings among the sm @xmath0 , the extra @xmath1 and possibly the photon as well . in this work , using the simple stueckelberg extension of the sm as an example , we demonstrate that these modifications can lead to the enhancement of the partial wave coefficients of the longitudinal weak gauge boson scatterings as compared with the sm",
    ". however , this phenomenon occurs only with the large mixing angle scenario .",
    "while we are fully aware of our choices of the parameter values for the large @xmath84 scenario might not be realistic , they are sufficient to demonstrate @xmath23 scatterings as a sensitive probe to both the pure gauge structure as well as the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "thus , it should be interesting to study if this scenario is consistent with existing experimental constraints from lep and tevatron by performing the global fits for the stueckelberg extension of the sm with or without the kinetic mixing term .    in many extensions of the sm , other types of extra @xmath4 gauge groups are possible .",
    "these include sequential @xmath1 , superstring @xmath1 @xcite and various types of @xmath1 based on @xmath127 unification @xcite .",
    "data from electroweak precision tests , lep ii and cdf / d0 had put stringent constraints on both the mixing angle as well as the @xmath1 mass for these models @xcite . thus they are similar to the stsm with small mixing angles that we have also studied in this work",
    ". hence there should be no difference from the sm for the longitudinal @xmath8 scatterings in these models .    before closing",
    ", we note that an extra @xmath128 mixing with the sm @xmath12 may also lead to modifications of the trilinear and quartic couplings in the pure gauge sector as well as the @xmath129 couplings",
    ". they may give rise to enhancement in the other channels like @xmath130 and @xmath131 which are shown in our analysis to have no difference from the sm results for the stsm even with large mixing angles .",
    "thus in general one should bear in mind that scatterings of longitudinal weak gauge bosons are not only sensitive to the underlying electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism , but also to the pure gauge sector structure .",
