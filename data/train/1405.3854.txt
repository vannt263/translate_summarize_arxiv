    "the modulation of the amplitude in luminosity and the pulsation period , known as blazhko effect , is observed in numerous rr  lyr stars @xcite .",
    "alhough its theoretical explanation has not yet been determined , a considerable breakthrough in its interpretation has been realized because of recent space observations . as a matter of fact , corot @xcite and _ kepler _",
    "@xcite results have shown that the blazhko mechanism is not acting as a clock , thus undermining both the competing models based on a strict regularity : the oblique pulsator and the resonant nonradial pulsator . in our previous work on galactic blazhko stars",
    "@xcite , we did not consider the eponym of the class , i.e. , hd  182989@xmath1rr  lyr .",
    "we know that its pulsational period shows some apparent erratic changes @xcite .",
    "indeed , we thought that the observation of rr  lyr through the ages deserved a detailed study and , furthermore , dedicated projects .",
    "the variability of rr  lyr was discovered by mrs .",
    "willemina p. fleming ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a short but complete biography ) on the photographic plates of the henry draper memorial in 1899 @xcite .",
    "@xcite reports that the first observation dates back to july 20 , 1899 and the first maximum to september 23 , 1899 ( hjd  2414921.675 , calculated by * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite and @xcite were the first to show the correlated photometric and spectroscopic variations .",
    "5 of shapley ( 1916 ) constitutes the _ ante litteram _ representation of the blazhko effect  note that this definition was introduced later in the astronomical literature  because it shows the oscillation of the median magnitude of the ascending branch with a period of 40  d and an amplitude of 37  min .",
    "@xcite compiled the first long list of observed maxima and reported a detailed investigation of the blazhko effect @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that spectroscopic and photometric parameters were strongly variable in the blazhko cycles of 1961 and 1963 , but essentially constant in those of 1962 .",
    "the idea of irregularities in the blazhko period gradually grew and later extended photoelectric observations suggested a 4-year cycle in the blazhko effect , with a minimum variability in 1971 june and a new maximum variability in 1972 april @xcite .",
    "a hundred years after the discovery of the rr  lyr  variability , @xcite have reported that attempts at representing the blazhko variations by longer periods have failed because they are not strictly repetitive .",
    "extensive photoelectric and ccd observations obtained over a 421-day interval in 2003 - 2004 fixed a shorter blazhko period of 38.8@xmath20.1  d @xcite .",
    "finally , rr  lyr@xmath1kic7198959 was included in the field of view of the _ kepler _ space telescope @xcite .",
    "thus , high - precision , continuous observations could be secured , first in the long cadence ( 29.4  min ) mode and then in the short cadence ( 1.0  min ) observing mode .",
    "@xcite have reported the results in the long cadence mode , while @xcite and @xcite have reported the results in the short cadence mode .",
    "rr  lyr shows no particularities in metallicity , abundances and physical characteristics when compared with the other _ kepler _ rr  lyrae stars , blazhko and non - blazhko , observed by means of homogeneous high - resolution spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the full comprehension of the rr  lyr variability is very time demanding since the star has to be observed over decades with time series having a high temporal resolution , in order to survey the pulsation period ( @xmath0 ) of 13  h , the blazhko period ( @xmath3 ) of 40  d , and the long - term changes of both ."
