    "an ultracold bose gas is , in general , a mixture of a coherent bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) and an incoherent ( fluctuating ) vapor \" . as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) description of such a mixture in one dimension is provided by the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation for the condensate order parameter @xmath0 , coupled to equations for components of the vapor wave function , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which are responsible for normal and anomalous densities of the fluctuations .",
    "this approach and related formalisms for the description of fluctuations make it possible to analyze various effects , such as quantum phase diffusion in bec  and its depletion in a time - dependent trap through transfer of atoms to non - condensed states @xcite , depletion of dark solitons @xcite , quantum - noise squeezing of _ gap solitons _ in a repulsive condensate trapped in an optical lattice ( ol ) canberra , deviations from one - dimensionality @xcite , and friction and diffusion of solitons in a cloud of thermal atoms @xcite .",
    "the full system of coupled hfb equations was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to show that , in the case of attraction between atoms , the matter flux from the condensate to the vapor may lead to splitting of bright matter - wave solitons ( which have been created experimentally in @xmath3li @xcite and @xmath4rb @xcite condensates ) into two fragments that may be regarded as _ partially incoherent _ solitons , i.e. , bound states of the coherent condensate and vapor components , similar to partially incoherent solitons known in nonlinear optics @xcite .",
    "the objective of this work is to find solutions for partially incoherent gap solitons ( gss ) in an ol potential , and investigate their stability , at zero and finite temperatures .",
    "gss in bec were predicted using the gp equation @xcite , and then created experimentally in a @xmath5rb condensate @xcite ( these solitons were quite meager \" , each consisting of just a few hundred atoms ) .",
    "partially incoherent lattice solitons at finite temperature ( @xmath6 ) were qualitatively predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite , which relied upon simulations of the gp equation , starting with a random bose distribution at finite @xmath6 and gradually forming a soliton by switching the ol potential on .",
    "families of two - component gss of _ intragap _ and _ intergap _ types ( see below ) , i.e. , with chemical potentials of the components falling in one or different bandgaps of their common ol - induced linear spectrum , were found  within the framework of gp equations coupled by repulsion between the species @xcite .",
    "it is relevant to mention that two - component solitons of the intergap type moti2 , as well as their discrete counterparts @xcite , were earlier predicted in lattice models of nonlinear optics @xcite ; however , these were coherent objects and , unlike the model considered here ( see below ) , they were found in models that did not include coherent four - wave - mixing terms .",
    "the gs is not a ground state of the repulsive condensate ( it is obvious that it does not realize an absolute energy minimum for the self - repulsive condensate loaded into the ol potential , with a given number of atoms ) , but it is nevertheless stable .",
    "it is relevant to stress the difference of the analysis of quantum fluctuations around the gss from the problem of quantum depletion of dark solitons , where fluctuations fill out the notch at the center of the soliton and thus gradually destroy it @xcite . for gss ( which are bright solitons )",
    ", the notch is absent in the family of solutions found in the first bandgap [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) below ] . in the second gap , notch(es ) may be present in decaying wings of the soliton s waveform [ see figs .",
    "[ fig1](b ) and [ fig4 ] ] , but the soliton s identity is not predicated on them .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we formulate the model , which is based on time - dependent hfb equations for the coherent condensate and incoherent vapor components interacting with it ( at finite @xmath6 ) .",
    "basic results for the partially coherent gs families of the intra- and intergap types , found in a numerical form at @xmath7 and @xmath8 , are reported in section iii .",
    "examples of higher - order ( multi - humped ) solitons of various types are presented in section iii too .",
    "stability of these solitons is investigated , by means of computation of the corresponding eigenvalues for small perturbations , and in direct simulations , in section iv .",
