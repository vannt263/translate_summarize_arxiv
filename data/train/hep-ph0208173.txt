    "we consider  @xcite an isospin triplet pion field @xmath4 interacting with quark fields @xmath5 through the lagrangian density @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the isospin vector operator . the imaginary part of the amplitude for @xmath0 is considered at lowest order ( @xmath8 ) and obtained using cutkosky rules .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath9 ( see fig .  [",
    "figure1].a ) is chosen to fulfill the number of particles sum rule ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the effects of the pion size are mimicked by the introduction of a cut - off ( @xmath11 ) on an observable quantity , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath12 for the process @xmath13 , thus in a gauge invariant way.",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] , @xmath9 exhibits plateaux for @xmath14 gev@xmath3 .",
    "these plateau values are in reasonable agreement with those extracted in the njl model  @xcite .",
    "a similar behaviour is obtained for the momentum fraction @xmath15 derived from @xmath16 .",
    "the structure function @xmath17 is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] , which illustrates the effect of the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath18 , and the evolution for increasing @xmath1 .",
    "the most striking feature of these distributions is the vanishing of @xmath17 for @xmath19 larger than some value @xmath20 .",
    "this effect originates from the kinematical cuts .",
    "indeed for a finite @xmath1 , when @xmath19 is large , there is no way to put the cut quarks on their mass shell : this requires at least an energy of @xmath21 .    the vanishing at large @xmath19 is not obtained in similar works , in particular in ref .  @xcite . in this reference ,",
    "the bjorken limit is taken first and the kinematical constraint is not applied .",
    "this procedure does not seem correct for evaluating cross - sections at finite @xmath1 .",
    "we have presented the simplest model allowing to relate virtual photon - pion forward elastic scattering to quark distributions .",
    "the introduction of a cut - off due to the pion size makes crossed diagrams appear as higher twists and thus allows us to define quark distributions .",
    "however , the introduction of the cut - off breaks the momentum sum rule ( 2@xmath22 ) at @xmath23 because , in the case of the pion , constituent quarks can never be considered as free .",
    "we motivated the cut - off as a manifestation of the pion size . the value @xmath24",
    "gev@xmath25 is close to the hard core rms radius of the chiral bag model , 0.35 fm @xcite .",
    "the cut - off has been imposed on the relative quark momentum .",
    "this procedure is at variance with the double - subtraction pauli - villars procedure proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , or with other ones introduced in similar works based on njl models .",
    "in addition , there is no need in our approach to consider additional diagrams with local pion - pion - quark - quark interactions . yet",
    ", the pion - quark - quark coupling constant turns out to be the same in our approach and in njl models",
    ". this may not be too surprising , as in both cases this coupling is determined by the requirement that the pion appears as made of two constituent quarks .",
