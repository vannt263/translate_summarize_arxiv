    "it is well known that quantum observables in the canonical ensemble in some situations can be approximated by molecular dynamics simulations with constant number of particles , volume and temperature , see @xcite .",
    "the first mathematical result of such a semi - classical limit was by wigner @xcite : wigner introduced the `` wigner''-function , based on solutions to the schrdinger equation with scalar potentials , and made an expansion in the planck constant to relate the canonical quantum observable , as defined by von neumann @xcite , to the classical gibbs phase - space average .    in this work we study molecular dynamics approximations of canonical ensemble averages for quantum observables in the case of hamiltonians consisting of the kinetic energy of nuclei and a matrix valued potential for nuclei - electron interaction and electron kinetic energy .",
    "the purpose of having a matrix valued operator for the electron part in the hamiltonian is to replace the time evolution for the electrons by the schrdinger electron eigenvalue problem .",
    "an advantage with including the electron part as a matrix valued operator is that the classical limit , as the nuclei - electron mass ration tends to infinity , can be derived as we will explain .",
    "this classical limit can then be approximated by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations for nuclei , with the potential generated by the electron eigenvalue problem , see @xcite and @xcite , which requires less computational effort than to solve the schrdinger equation with time dependent electrons .",
    "if the temperature is very small in comparison with the minimal difference of the second and first eigenvalue of the electron potential , the probability for the quantum system to be in excited electron states is negligible and canonical ab initio molecular dynamics based on the ground state electron eigenvalue yields accurate approximations .",
    "when the temperature is not small compared to this electron eigenvalue gap , the probability to be in excited states is substantial .",
    "an important question , which seems mathematically open , is : how to modify the canonical ab initio molecular dynamics to accurately approximate quantum observables , based on matrix valued potentials and all temperatures ?",
    "the aim here is to derive molecular dynamics methods that accurately , in mathematical sense , approximate the quantum observable also in the case where the temperature can be large compared to this first spectral gap .",
    "the approximation consists of a weighted sum , over electron eigenvalues , of molecular dynamics observables based on the corresponding scalar hamiltonians , which are equal to the eigenvalues of the original matrix valued hamiltonian symbol .",
    "also the weights , which are the probabilities to be in the corresponding electron states , are determined precisely as molecular dynamics observables .",
    "sections [ sec_gibbs ] and [ sec_corr ] present analysis with quantum observables not depending on correlations in time and observables depending on time correlations , respectively .",
    "the main result is that canonical quantum observables , based on schrdinger hamiltonians with matrix valued potentials , can for any positive temperature be approximated by ab initio molecular dynamics : the approximation error is bounded by the electron - nuclei mass ratio , @xmath0 , times a constant , provided the observable symbols have up to three derivatives bounded in @xmath1 , the hamiltonian symbol has five derivatives and the electron eigenvalues are distinct for any nuclei position .",
    "an improved approximation error @xmath2 holds with additional assumptions .",
    "the result includes observables that depend on correlations in time .",
    "the main mathematical tool is the semi - classical weyl law , as formulated e.g. in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the semi - classical weyl law has been used before in @xcite to approximate canonical quantum observables , based on matrix valued potentials , by phase - space averages .",
    "a difference is that our error estimates are not based on the calderon - vaillancourt theorem that bounds the @xmath3 operator norm of a symbol by @xmath4 estimates of derivatives of order @xmath5 of the symbol .",
    "instead we use a combination of the hilbert - schmidt norm of quantum observables and weyl s law to obtain bounds in terms of the @xmath1 norm of remainder symbols based on three and five derivatives of the observables and the hamiltonian , respectively .",
    "other differences are in the use of projections to electron states , that here is based on a nonlinear eigenvalue problem solved by cauchy - kovalevsky s theorem , and that we analyze the weights to be in the different electron states and determine them as molecular dynamics observables .",
    "let @xmath6 for @xmath7 be the infinite sequence of all normalized @xmath8^d$ ] eigenfunctions , with the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath9 , of the schrdinger operator @xmath10 i.e. @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a hermitian matrix valued confining potential and @xmath13 is the @xmath14 identity matrix times the laplacian in @xmath15 , modeling the nuclei kinetic energy .",
    "hence , the quantum model consists of nuclei coordinates that are in @xmath16 and the wave functions @xmath17 can take @xmath18 discrete values , based on a discretization of the electron eigenvalue problem with a corresponding discrete hamiltonian given by the matrix @xmath19 , for each nuclei configuration @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 is the nuclei - electron mass ratio , which is assumed to be a number much larger than one .",
    "the setting with individual nuclei masses and a diagonal mass matrix @xmath21 can be transformed to the form by introducing the new coordinates @xmath22 , which transforms the hamiltonian into @xmath23 . to handle the spectrum of @xmath24",
    "we assume that the smallest eigenvalue @xmath25 of @xmath19 tends to infinity as @xmath26 .",
    "this assumption implies that the spectrum of @xmath24 is discrete , see @xcite .",
    "therefore the set of eigenfunctions @xmath27 forms a complete @xmath28^d$ ] basis . to have a complete set of eigenfunctions in @xmath8^d$ ] is crucial for the analysis of the canonical quantum ensemble average in this work , which is based on the concept of the trace of quantum operators introduced by von neumann @xcite .",

    "this definition implies that @xmath31 has the integral kernel @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 further properties and background on the weyl quantization is presented e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the principal idea in this work is to view such kernels as infinite dimensional matrices and determine their trace as operators on @xmath8^d$ ] .",

    "the analysis here uses the fact that the @xmath42^{d}$ ] trace of a weyl operator based on a @xmath14 matrix valued symbol is equal to the phase - space average of its symbol trace , since we have @xmath43 where @xmath44 with the coordinate @xmath45 in phase - space and its lebesgue measure @xmath46 .",
    "in fact also the composition of two weyl operators is determined by the phase - space average as follows .",

    "this result is known , see @xcite .",
    "we include a proof since it is important for the work here .",
    "the kernel of the composition is @xmath51 so that the trace of the composition becomes @xmath52 using the change of variables @xmath53 , which verifies the claim .",
    "the aim here is to find molecular dynamics approximations to the gibbs canonical quantum ensemble average , defined as @xmath54 for a positive temperature @xmath55 and an observable symbol @xmath56 . in section [ sec_corr ]",
    "we consider related time dependent observables .",
    "the trace property of lemma [ composition ] shows that an approximation of the gibbs observable , where the order of the operations of exponentiation and quantization have been reversed , satisfies @xmath57 and in normalized form @xmath58    we first consider symbols for observables that can be diagonalized by the same transformation as the hamiltonian , which for instance includes the scalar observables .",
    "more precisely let @xmath59 be a symbol in the schwartz class and consider symbols in the matrix product form @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the @xmath14 matrix composed of the eigenvectors to @xmath19 as columns , i.e. @xmath62 and @xmath63 , denote the eigenvalues of @xmath19 in increasing order . here",
