    "the experiments of neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath1 ) play an important role in judging whether the neutrinos are majorana particles or dirac particles .",
    "the neutrinoless double beta decay is the double beta decay which does not emit any neutrinos .",
    "if we assume @xmath1 is caused by the exchange of three light majorana neutrinos , the observation of @xmath1 is the evidence that the neutrinos are majorana fermions @xcite .",
    "many experiments of @xmath1 are in progress and planed : candles @xcite , nemo-3 @xcite , solotvino @xcite , cuoricino @xcite , exo-200 @xcite , kamland - zen @xcite , etc .",
    "the signal of @xmath1 has not been detected yet . if neutrinos are majorana fermions , the lepton mixing matrix @xmath12 ( mns matrix @xcite ) is expressed by six parameters ; three lepton mixing angles @xmath13 , cp violating dirac phase @xmath14 , and two cp violating majorana phases @xmath15 .",
    "the two majorana phases @xmath15 are the degrees of freedom arising from the fact that the particle and the antiparticle are the same in majorana fermion . among these six parameters ,",
    "the value of three lepton mixing angles @xmath13 are measured @xcite . especially , the measurement of @xmath16 was made recently @xcite , whose effect on the study of @xmath1 had been investigated @xcite .",
    "the values of dirac phase @xmath14 and two majorana phases @xmath15 are unknown to this day .",
    "if we suppose that @xmath17 is caused by the exchange of three light majorana neutrinos , the amplitude of the decay is proportional to the @xmath17-decay effective majorana mass @xmath2 , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is neutrino mass of @xmath20-th mass eigenstate .",
    "the unitary matrix @xmath12 is the lepton mixing matrix ( mns matrix ) and parametrized as follows , @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are sine and cosine of the lepton mixing angle @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath25 satisfy @xmath26 , and we shall restrict the majorana phases , @xmath27 , which are enough to investigate the variation of @xmath28 .",
    "the effective mass @xmath28 depends on seven parameters ; two mixing angles @xmath29 and @xmath16 , three neutrino masses @xmath30 , and two majorana phases @xmath31 . with regard to these seven parameters ,",
    "the following four quantities are measured by experiments ; i.e. , two mixing angles @xmath29 , @xmath16 , and two mass squared differences @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "two majorana phases @xmath31 ( if majorana particles ) and the absolute neutrino mass scale ( we can take the lightest neutrino mass @xmath34 as the absolute neutrino mass scale ) are not measured , though an upper limit for the sum of the three light neutrino mass has been reported @xcite .",
    "there remains two possibilities with respect to the order of @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , that is the normal mass ordering ( @xmath37 ) and inverted mass ordering ( @xmath38 ) . in the normal mass ordering , we take the lightest neutrino mass @xmath39 as the absolute neutrino mass scale , @xmath40 in the inverted mass ordering , we take the lightest neutrino mass @xmath41 as the absolute neutrino mass scale , @xmath42 the signal of @xmath17 has not been detected , but an upper limit of the effective mass @xmath28 is obtained .",
    "while information on majorana phases @xmath31 is obtained by @xmath17 experiments @xcite , it is notable that the other experiments measuring the absolute neutrino mass scale are also important to determine the phases @xmath31 as discussed in ref @xcite .",
    "one of the most often used method for studying @xmath17 is that , regarding the lightest neutrino mass @xmath34 as a free parameter , the predicted values of the effective mass @xmath28 are investigated for each given value of the lightest neutrino mass .",
    "for instance , the authors in ref @xcite calculated 1 @xmath43 error on the predicted value of @xmath28 due to the uncertainties in the values of the neutrino oscillation parameters @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "we here suppose that the lightest neutrino mass @xmath34 is measured , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is 1 @xmath49 error on @xmath34 .",
    "if the normal mass ordering is assumed , we have @xmath39 ; while if the inverted mass ordering , @xmath41 . in this paper , we study contributions of the error on the lightest neutrino mass @xmath34 to the uncertainty of the predicted value of the majorana effective mass @xmath28 in the normal mass ordering case and in the inverted mass ordering case , respectively . in order to predict the value of @xmath28 which depends on the majorana phases @xmath50 and @xmath51 , we need the values of the absolute neutrino mass scale ( we can take the lightest neutrino mass @xmath34 ) and four oscillation parameters ; @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "these four oscillation parameters have been measured with relatively small errors , respectively .",
    "since we focus on the uncertainty @xmath48 of the lightest neutrino mass , we do not take into account the uncertainties of @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 in this article . by use of the propagation of errors , the 1 @xmath52 error on @xmath28 due to the uncertainty of @xmath34 is obtained , @xmath53 the predicted value of @xmath28 depends on the majorana phases @xmath54 , and if the uncertainty @xmath3 is large , the dependence of @xmath28 on @xmath55 and @xmath56 is obscured . to obtain some information on the majorana phases",

    "we also discuss the necessary condition for the relative error @xmath57 of the lightest neutrino mass to raise the possibility of probing the majorana phases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the normal mass ordering is assumed , so that the lightest neutrino mass @xmath58 .",

    "the result of straightforward calculation of @xmath3 is so complicated that we introduce complex - valued quantities @xmath59 and @xmath60 in subsection 2.1 . expressing @xmath3 by these complex - valued quantities @xmath59 and @xmath60",
    ", one can analyze it easily .",
    "we then investigate how @xmath3 behaves in the @xmath7 plane for each size of the lightest neutrino mass @xmath61 . in section 3 ,",

    ", we discuss the necessary condition that the relative error of the lightest neutrino mass should satisfy in order to raise the possibility of probing the majorana phases @xmath54 .",
    "section 5 is devoted to conclusions .",

    "three neutrino masses are degenerate and eq.([dae ] ) with @xmath276 becomes @xmath290 hence , in the case @xmath291 , the minimum condition so as to raise the possibility of obtaining the information on @xmath5 and @xmath6 is that the relative error @xmath287 of the lightest neutrino mass @xmath36 should be less than @xmath278 at least .",
    "the above result with the lightest neutrino mass @xmath292 in the inverted mass ordering case is the same as that with the lightest neutrino mass @xmath293 in the normal mass ordering case .",
    "this is natural because three neutrino masses are degenerate @xmath150 in both cases . in the second case , @xmath289 , eq.([dae ] ) with @xmath276",
    "becomes @xmath294 then , in the case @xmath295 , the minimum condition so as to raise the possibility of obtaining the information on @xmath5 and @xmath6 is that the relative error @xmath287 should be less than @xmath296 at least .",
    "we shall make two comments here .",
    "the first comment is concerned with the conditions eq.([dcf ] ) and eq.([dbh ] ) when the lightest neutrino mass is about @xmath297 .",
    "eq.([dcf ] ) shows that the relative error of the lightest neutrino mass should be less than @xmath298 in the inverted mass ordering case , while eq.([dbh ] ) shows that the relative error of the lightest neutrino mass should be less than @xmath299 in the normal mass ordering case .",
    "the contrast between these comes mainly from the fact that the behavior of @xmath300 in the inverted mass ordering case is different from that in the normal mass ordering case .",
    "as seen from fig.1 , the value of @xmath300 in the inverted mass ordering case is considerably less than the value of that in the normal mass ordering case in the region @xmath301 .",
    "the second comment is about the minimum condition for the relative error @xmath302 to raise the possibility of obtaining the information on @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in this paper , we have set the errors of the oscillation parameters zero .",
    "when these errors are included in our calculation , the condition required for the relative error of the lightest neutrino mass @xmath34 becomes stricter .",
    "hence , the condition for @xmath303 obtained in this chapter should be regarded as the least necessary condition .",
    "we studied the influence of the error of the lightest neutrino mass @xmath34 on the predicted value of the effective majorana mass @xmath304 under the assumption that the lightest neutrino mass is measured in experiments .",
    "the case of assuming the normal mass ordering and the case of assuming the inverted mass ordering are studied , respectively .",
    "the error of the predicted value of the effective majorana mass @xmath3 is represented by the error of the lightest neutrino mass @xmath250 with the law of propagation of errors provided that one sets the errors of the oscillation parameters zero , respectively .",
    "we have studied the error @xmath3 depending on the majorana phases @xmath5 and @xmath6 how it behaves in the @xmath7 plane , and how it changes according to the size of the lightest neutrino mass @xmath34 .",
    "it is shown that the maximum value of @xmath3 in the @xmath7 plane does not exceed the value of @xmath250 in general , and that the minimum value of @xmath3 in the @xmath7 plane can be zero when the lightest neutrino mass @xmath34 is small .",
    "an interesting feature is seen when the lightest neutrino mass @xmath34 has large value @xmath305 so that three neutrino masses are degenerate . in this case , the relative error of @xmath304 and that of @xmath34 are the same .",
    "we also investigated how the maximum value of @xmath3 in the @xmath7 plane changes according to the size of the lightest neutrino mass @xmath34 . in the normal mass ordering case ,",
    "the maximum value of @xmath3 in the @xmath7 plane is almost the same as @xmath4 when the lightest neutrino mass @xmath306 is large such as @xmath307 . when the value of @xmath306 decreases , the maximum value of @xmath3 decreases gradually , and it becomes @xmath308 if @xmath61 is approximately zero . in the inverted mass ordering case , the maximum value of @xmath3 in the @xmath7 plane is almost the same as @xmath4 when the lightest neutrino mass @xmath309 is large such as @xmath310 .",
    "when the value of @xmath309 decreases , however , the maximum value of @xmath3 decreases rapidly , and it becomes @xmath311 if @xmath36 is approximately zero .    in eq.([bab ] ) where @xmath3 is represented by @xmath4 ( the case of @xmath306 ) , the factor @xmath312 @xmath313 has been calculated straightforwardly and the result eq.([bba ] ) contains @xmath28 in the denominator .",
    "when @xmath28 becomes very small , therefore , one may guess that @xmath3 can take very large value at first sight .",
    "however , it is shown by the analytic calculation that the maximum value of @xmath3 in the @xmath7 plane does not exceed @xmath4 .",
    "this demonstration owes the complex quantities @xmath59 and @xmath60 which are introduced in eq.([bbe ] ) and eq.([bbf ] ) . utilizing these @xmath59 and @xmath60",
    ", we showed that the maximum value of @xmath3 in the @xmath7 plane is given by eq.([bbi ] ) in the normal mass ordering case , and by eq.([cbf ] ) in the inverted mass ordering case , respectively .",
    "we have especially paid attention to the influence of the error of the lightest neutrino mass @xmath4 on the uncertainty of the predicted value of the effective majorana mass @xmath3 . if we wish to have the information on the majorana phases @xmath5 and @xmath6 through @xmath28 , we need to investigate the dependence of @xmath28 on @xmath5 and @xmath6 . hence , we studied the uncertainty @xmath3 of the predicted value of @xmath28 in detail ; how does it behave in the @xmath7 plane , how does it depend on the lightest neutrino mass @xmath34 , and how large is it . at the outset",
    ", the minimum condition required for the relative error @xmath314 in order to raise the possibility of obtaining the information on @xmath5 and @xmath6 is considered in section 4 .",
    "for instance , in the case of @xmath315 ( @xmath150 ) , the relative error of @xmath34 should be less than @xmath316 so that the allowed region of @xmath28 does not cover the width @xmath317 by @xmath318 .",
    "hereafter , it will be necessary to study minimum condition required for the relative error of @xmath34 so as to narrow the allowed region of the predicted value @xmath28 . in the following ,",
    "we give a simple example in the case @xmath319 .",
    "if the cp - invariance are maintained , the majorana phases take the values , @xmath320 , and in the restricted region @xmath321 , @xmath322 the values of @xmath304 at the above four points @xmath323 satisfy @xmath324 the allowed region of the predicted value of @xmath325 is given by @xmath326 if the error @xmath327 of the lightest neutrino mass is large such as @xmath328 the allowed region of @xmath329 and that of @xmath330 overlap . under this condition ,",
    "the information on the cp violating majorana phases @xmath55 and @xmath56 which lie between @xmath329 and @xmath330 can not be obtained . using the relation @xmath331 , eq.([ed ] ) becomes @xmath332 where @xmath333 has been adopted .",
    "we therefore see that , in order to obtain the information on @xmath55 and @xmath56 through the @xmath2 ( @xmath334 ) with cp violating majorana phases @xmath54 , the relative error of @xmath34 should be less than @xmath335 at least .",
    "this is a simple example , and further investigation will be needed .",
    "lastly , we note that we have set the errors of the measured values of the oscillation parameters zero for simplicity .",
    "although these errors are expected to decrease by future experiments , it is necessary to consider the influence of these errors of the oscillation parameters on the @xmath2 .",
