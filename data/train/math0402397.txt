    "although these moves look very similar in nature , their relationship is complicated , so we failed in this attempt .",
    "one of the reasons for the difficulties in all the mentioned attempts is that , as opposed to rc - graphs , there is no intrinsic description of the diagrams in @xmath464 or @xmath460 , just recursive constructions .",
    "we now investigate a new set of diagrams @xmath476 , which is in a monomial preserving bijection with @xmath49 ( thus providing a combinatorial construction of @xmath16 ) , and which has both a recursive and a nonrecursive construction .",

    "the nonrecursive construction of @xmath476 is very easy to state using the one - to - one map @xmath291 on rc - graphs defined in ( [ defphi ] ) , namely @xmath477 .",

    "indeed , it turns out that the set of compatible sequences is preserved under the latter map ( compatible sequences for arbitrary words are defined in the same way as for reduced words ) . here is an easy way to see this : we translate the compatibility condition into the language of keys as stated in ( [ keycond ] ) ( there is a similar statement for words instead of reduced words ) , and then we invoke the plactification map .",
    "we need , of course , the properties of this map listed in theorem [ pla ] , as well as the following property appearing in @xcite : @xmath484 , for ssyt @xmath245 whose column word is reduced .",

    "the labeling is constructed as follows : the cell in row @xmath573 and column @xmath574 is labeled @xmath575 if the adjacent transposition @xmath576 in @xmath47 transposes @xmath574 and @xmath577 , where @xmath578 .",
    "note that the number of labels @xmath54 is equal to the number of crosses in row @xmath54 of the rc - graph ; this means that the bijection is monomial preserving .",
    "for instance , the balanced labeling of the diagram of @xmath579 corresponding to the second rc - graph in example [ exrc ] is the following .",
    "we now intend to study the inverse map , from balanced labelings to rc - graphs . to this end",
    ", we associate a word @xmath581 to a balanced labeling @xmath416 , and a word @xmath582 to an rc - graph @xmath41 .",
    "the former is defined simply by sorting the entries in each row of @xmath416 in ( weakly ) decreasing order , and by concatenating the sequences obtained in this way , in increasing order of the rows .",
    "now consider an rc - graph @xmath41 in @xmath49 .",
    "assume that the permutation @xmath39 has @xmath255 descents , namely in positions @xmath583 ; this means that @xmath584 if and only if @xmath585 for some @xmath54 .",
    "we can associate a word @xmath586 with line @xmath44 in @xmath41 in the following way : follow the line starting from its left end , and to each cross traversed horizontally associate a letter in @xmath587 equal to the number of the row where the cross lies .",
    "now let @xmath588 , where @xmath589 and @xmath590 ; also let @xmath591 .",
    "[ balrem](1 ) the definition of the bijection @xmath570 immediately implies that if @xmath592 , then @xmath593 .",
    "therefore , we can reconstruct @xmath41 from @xmath594 only ; that is , @xmath41 is determined by the _ set _ of labels in the rows of @xmath416 .",
    "the precise description of the procedure is given in algorithm [ bd2rc ] .",
    "+ ( 2 ) if we sort the columns in a balanced labeling in ascending order , we obtain a sequence of words which can be read off from the corresponding rc - graph by following its lines starting at their top end , and by recording the row number of each cross traversed vertically .",
    "+ ( 3 ) the entries in the rows and columns of a balanced labeling are neither increasing nor decreasing , in general .",
    "in fact , based on lemma [ tto ] and remark [ balrem ] ( 1 ) , we can easily check that if @xmath12 is 321-avoiding , then the entries in the rows of a balanced labeling of @xmath457 are weakly decreasing , and the entries in columns are strictly increasing .",
    "it is well - known that , by omitting empty rows and columns in the diagram of a 321-avoiding permutation @xmath12 , we obtain a skew young diagram @xmath595 in french notation .",
    "hence , the corresponding balanced labelings can be identified with the _ reverse ssyt _ of skew shape @xmath596 ( in english notation ) satisfying a certain flag condition ; the corresponding flag vector is clearly the decreasing sequence of integers @xmath44 for which the @xmath44th entry in @xmath66 in nonzero . recall that a filling of a skew young diagram is called a reverse ssyt ( or column - strict plane partition ) if the entries are weakly decreasing in rows and strictly decreasing in columns . in @xcite , these reverse ssyt are reinterpreted as ssyt of the shape obtained from @xmath596 by a @xmath597 rotation .",
    "thus , we have a straightforward way of rederiving the fact ( proved in @xcite ) that schubert polynomials indexed by 321-avoiding permutations are flagged skew schur polynomials .",
    "+ ( 4 ) according to the previous remark , if @xmath12 is a grassmannian permutation with descent at @xmath598 , then the map @xmath570 followed by the renumbering @xmath599 of the entries in @xmath600 is a bijection from @xmath49 to ssyt of shape @xmath601 with entries @xmath602 .",
    "this was already observed in @xcite .",
    "note that the mentioned bijection is _ not _ monomial preserving ; therefore , it is different from the map @xmath377 ( discussed in section 4 ) between the same sets as above , which is a bijection for grassmannian permutations . hence , it is natural to ask about the way in which the ssyt @xmath603 is related to the reverse ssyt @xmath600 of the same shape .",
    "this is addressed in theorem [ revtab ] below .",
    "[ revtab ] for any grassmannian permutation @xmath12 and @xmath41 in @xmath371 , we have @xmath604 more generally , if @xmath12 is 321-avoiding , then @xmath603 is the rectification of the ssyt of skew shape obtained from @xmath600 by a @xmath597 rotation .",
    "let @xmath12 be 321-avoiding . by theorem [ pla ]",
    "( 3 ) and ( [ symm ] ) , we have @xmath605 recall that @xmath606 cf .",
    "( [ defphi ] ) and the definition of the biword @xmath130 ( corresponding to some biword @xmath12 ) at the beginning of section 3 . on the other hand , we know from theorem [ bij1 ] that @xmath556 .",
    "therefore , by remark [ balrem ] ( 2 ) , we have that @xmath607 is precisely the column word of @xmath600 . in conclusion",
    ", @xmath603 can be obtained by applying schensted insertion to the reverse column word of @xmath600 , and therefore coincides with @xmath608 when @xmath12 is grassmannian .

    "we conclude with a closer look at the word @xmath582 associated to an rc - graph @xmath41 .",
    "we view @xmath582 as the sequence of its subwords @xmath612 , where @xmath589 .",
    "note that the length of the subword @xmath587 is the @xmath44th entry @xmath613 in the code of @xmath50 .",
    "hence the lengths of @xmath614 form a weakly increasing sequence .",
    "now view @xmath424 as a filling of a young diagram of shape @xmath615 , where the french convention for such diagrams is used .",
    "fix @xmath54 , @xmath44 such that @xmath616 , and consider the lines @xmath44 and @xmath617 in @xmath41 .",
    "it is not hard to see that all lines which cross line @xmath44 vertically will have to cross line @xmath617 vertically as well ; indeed , such lines can not cross line @xmath44 twice , so they must exit the region between lines @xmath44 and @xmath617 by crossing the latter .",
    "now remove all crosses in the mentioned region . by following the lines which cross line @xmath44 vertically in the new diagram",
    ", we obtain a pairing of these crosses with some crosses on line @xmath617 ( see the figure below ) .",
    "obviously , the row of the first cross in any pair is strictly smaller than the row of the second .",
    "furthermore , we can order the pairs such that the first and second components appear in the order obtained by following lines @xmath44 and @xmath617 from their left ends to their top ends .",
    "this essentially shows that the entries in the columns of @xmath424 strictly increase .",
    "@xmath618    the sequences of reverse ssyt corresponding to the two rc - graphs in example [ exrc ] are shown below , stacked on top of each other . more precisely , there are three reverse ssyt , corresponding to the following sets of rows : @xmath619 , @xmath620 , @xmath621 . @xmath622    the sequence of reverse ssyt @xmath623 associated to an rc - graph @xmath41 might be useful for the important open problem of multiplying schubert polynomials .",
    "one approach to this problem , adopted in @xcite , is to define an insertion procedure for rc - graphs ( i.e. , to `` insert '' an rc - graph into another ) which generalizes schensted insertion .",
    "there are such procedures ( see the mentioned papers ) which `` insert '' rc - graphs @xmath41 corresponding to certain grassmannian permutations .",
    "they can be viewed as `` insertions '' of the corresponding words @xmath582 , and they depend on a parameter @xmath598 , which is the unique descent of the permutation @xmath50 ; we call such an insertion a @xmath598-insertion . based on the results of the mentioned papers",
    ", we suggest that the general procedure of `` inserting '' an arbitrary rc - graph @xmath41 into another could be reduced to a sequence of @xmath624-insertions of the words @xmath424 corresponding to @xmath41 .",
