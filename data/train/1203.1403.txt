    "the origin of the fermion masses and mixings along with the related problem of @xmath0 violation constitute a formidable challenge for elementary particle physics . leaving apart extremely small neutrino masses ,",
    "even the charged fermion mass hierarchy ranges over at least five orders of magnitude .",
    "since the fermion masses are derived from the yukawa couplings , which are free parameters within the standard model ( sm ) , these yukawa couplings must span several orders of magnitude to accommodate the strongly hierarchical pattern of the fermion masses and mixings .",
    "however , the currently available data on the fermion masses and mixings is insufficient for an unambiguous reconstruction of the fermion mass matrices . to make matters worse",
    ", radiative corrections can obscure the underlying structures .",
    "thus , the existing data can not , without some additional assumptions , determine all the elements of the yukawa coupling matrices for the quarks and the leptons .",
    "some of these assumptions , invoked to restrict the form of the fermion mass matrices include the presence of texture zeros @xcite , requirement of zero determinant @xcite and vanishing minors @xcite to name just a few .",
    "the main motivation for invoking different mass matrix anstze is to relate the fermion masses and mixing angles in a testable manner which reduces the number of free parameters in the yukawa sector .",
    "the recent evidence for non - zero neutrino masses and mixings leads to a further proliferation of free parameters in the yukawa sector . in the absence of a significant breakthrough in the theoretical understanding of the fermion flavors ,",
    "the phenomenological approaches are bound to play a crucial role in interpreting new experimental data on the quark and the lepton mixing .",
    "these approaches are expected to provide useful hints towards unravelling the dynamics of the fermion mass generation , @xmath0 violation and identification of possible underlying symmetries of the fermion flavors from which viable models of the fermion mass generation and flavor mixing could , hopefully , be constructed .",
    "+ the strong fermion mass hierarchy should be apparent in the fermion mass matrices themselves with the contribution of smaller elements to physical masses and mixing angles expected to be negligibly small .",
    "thus , these elements can , effectively , be neglected and replaced by zeros : the so - called texture zeros .",
    "however , the current neutrino oscillation data is consistent only with a limited number of texture schemes @xcite .",
    "specifically , the available neutrino oscillation data disallow all the neutrino mass matrices with three or more texture zeros @xcite in the flavor basis .",
    "the texture zeros at different positions in the neutrino mass matrix , in particular , and the fermion mass matrices , in general , could be the consequence of some underlying symmetry .",
    "such universal textures of the fermion mass matrices can be realized within the framework of grand unified theories ( guts ) .",
    "though grand unification on its own does not shed any light on the flavor problem , the guts provide the optimal framework in which possible solutions to the flavor problem could be embedded .",
    "grand unified models attempt to explain the masses and mixings in both the quark and the lepton sectors simultaneously .",
    "the textures for the mass matrices obtained in these models can either be assumed at the very outset or can be derived from the observed mixing matrix in the flavor basis .",
    "alternatively , the textures of the mass matrix can be obtained by embedding some family symmetry within the chosen grand unification group .",
    "one particularly interesting class of models is that based upon the so(10 ) grand unification group .",
    "there are two kinds of minimal models in this class : those based upon higgs dimension * 10 , 126 * , @xmath1 and possibly also * 120 * and/or * 210 * and those based upon * 10 , 16 , * @xmath2 and * 45 * representations . the former choice , generally , has symmetric and/or antisymmetric texture mass matrices while the latter type generally imply lopsided mass matrices for the down type quarks and the charged leptons . in the present work ,",
    "we consider the four zero texture [ ftz ] anstz for the fermion mass matrices within the so(10 ) gut framework . within this framework",
    ", we not only have a relation between the down type quark mass matrices ( @xmath3 ) and the charged lepton mass matrices ( @xmath4 ) but also a relation between the up - type quark mass matrices ( @xmath5 ) and the dirac neutrino mass matrices ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "four zero texture anstz is especially important since it can successfully describe not only the quark but also the lepton sector including the charged lepton and the neutrino masses .",
    "moreover , these are compatible with specific gut models @xcite and can be obtained from abelian flavor symmetries @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these mass matrices can accommodate the present value of sin@xmath7 @xcite . in view of the phenomenological success of the fzt anstz",
    ", it would be interesting to examine it in the larger context of so(10 ) gut .",
    "the fzt anstz has been studied earlier @xcite in the context of so(10 ) gut which , in general , leads to relations between mass matrices . on",
    "the other hand texture zeros imply relations between the elements of the mass matrices .",
    "it is , therefore , interesting to examine fzt anstze within the framework of so(10 ) gut . in the earlier analysis @xcite somehow",
    ", the constraints implied by texture zeros of the neutrino mass matrix have not been incorporated into the analysis and only so(10 ) constraints on mass matrices have been used . in the present work ,",
    "we have obtained the fzt constraints on the lepton mass matrices in sec .",
    "these constraints have been incorporated into the analysis of so(10 ) gut with four zero texture structure in sec .",
    "we have also presented the takagi diagonalization of the general complex symmetric neutrino mass matrix in sec .",
    "3 without making any simplifying assumption for the phases .",
    "conclusions have been summarized in sec .",
    "all information about the lepton masses and mixings is encoded in a hermitian charged lepton mass matrix @xmath8 and the neutrino mass matrix @xmath9 which is complex symmetric .",
    "both these matrices have parallel texture structure i.e. zeros at ( 1,1 ) and ( 1,3 ) places @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we consider a special case of fzt anstze in which the lepton mass matrices have parallel texture structure with zero entries at ( 1 , 1 ) and ( 1 , 3 ) places .",
    "the charged fermion mass matrices are assumed to be of the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 for charged lepton , up - type quarks and down - type quarks , respectively .",
    "the elements @xmath13 and @xmath14 are complex with @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the elements @xmath17 and @xmath18 are real because of hermiticity of @xmath19 .",
    "the unitary matrices @xmath20 diagonalize the mass matrices @xmath19 : @xmath21 here @xmath22 and @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 is the diagonalization matrix for the real symmetric mass matrix @xmath26 . using the invariants , tr@xmath27 , tr@xmath28 and det@xmath27",
    "three elements @xmath29 of the total four elements can be written in terms of remaining one element @xmath18 and the mass eigenvalues @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 of the fermion mass matrix @xmath19 as latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } b_f =- m_{f1}+m_{f2}+m_{f3}-d_f,\\nonumber\\\\     the free parameter @xmath18 should be in the range @xmath34 for the elements @xmath35 and @xmath36 to be real . using eqn.(3 ) the elements of the diagonalization matrix , @xmath25 can be written in terms of the charged fermion masses and the charged fermion mass matrix element @xmath18 as @xmath37 the neutrino mass matrix @xmath38 is complex symmetric for which all the four elements are in general complex and is diagonalized by a complex unitary matrix @xmath39 : @xmath40 where @xmath41 the diagonalization matrices @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are not physically observable but the products @xmath46 @xcite , and @xmath47 @xcite are the physically observable quark and lepton mixing matrices , respectively .",
    "they can be parametrized in terms of the mixing angles and @xmath0 violating phases .",
    "considering neutrinos to be the majorana particles , we parametrize @xmath48 in terms of the three mixing angles ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) and the three @xmath0 violating phases ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) as @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 for @xmath58=1 , 2 , 3 .    the ( 1,1 ) and ( 1,3 ) entries of the neutrino mass matrix @xmath9 are assumed to be zero .",

    "the three charged lepton masses are @xcite @xmath82 the experimental constraints on the neutrino oscillation parameters with their best fit values and 3@xmath83 deviations are @xcite @xmath84     +    in addition , there is an upper bound on the mixing angle @xmath51 from the chooz experiment(@xmath85 ) . recently t2k@xcite and minos@xcite experiments have given hints of a relatively large @xmath51 .",

    "this constraint can be used to constrain the unknown parameters @xmath54 , @xmath91 and the third mixing angle @xmath51 which has not been measured experimentally as yet .",

    "we obtain two allowed regions for the free parameter @xmath91 .",
    "we call them ` low @xmath91 ' and ` high @xmath91 ' solutions .",
    "the other two free parameters ( @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) are not constrained by the presence of texture zeros because they factor out from eqns.(8 ) and ( 9 ) .",

    "in the next step we combine the fzt anstz with the constraints obtained from the so(10 ) gut .",

    "we have 8 independent equations on 22 free parameters appearing in the quark and the charged lepton sectors .",
    "however , using the experimental results on the quark / charged lepton masses and mixings which includes six quark masses , three ckm mixing angles , one ckm @xmath0 violating phase and three charged lepton masses , we are left with only one free parameter to be fixed .",
