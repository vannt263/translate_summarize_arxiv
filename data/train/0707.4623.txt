    "a strong interest for a new measurement of the ratio @xmath8 has recently arisen , triggered by the work of ref .  .",
    "the sm prediction of @xmath9 benefits from cancellation of hadronic uncertainties to a large extent and therefore can be calculated with high precision .",
    "including radiative corrections , the total uncertainty is less than 0.5 per mil  @xcite .",
    "since the electronic channel is helicity - suppressed by the @xmath10 structure of the charged weak current , @xmath9 can receive contributions from physics beyond the sm , for example from multi - higgs effects inducing an effective pseudoscalar interaction .",
    "it has been shown in ref .   that deviations from the sm of up to few percent on @xmath9 are quite possible in minimal supersymmetric extensions of the sm and in particular should be dominated by lepton - flavor violating contributions with tauonic neutrinos emitted . using the present kloe dataset of @xmath62.5 fb@xmath2 of luminosity integrated at the @xmath3-meson peak , we show that an accuracy of about 1  % in the measurement of @xmath9 might be reached .    in order to compare with the sm prediction at this level of accuracy , one has to treat carefully the effect of radiative corrections , which contribute several percent to the @xmath11 width .",
    "in particular , the sm prediction of ref .",
    "@xcite is made considering all photons emitted by the process of internal bremsstrahlung ( ib ) while ignoring any contribution from structure - dependent direct emission ( de ) .",
    "of course both processes contribute , so in the analysis we will consider de as a background which can be distinguished from the ib width by means of a different photon energy spectrum .",

    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 decay with a mean length of @xmath21  90  cm and can be distinguished by their decays in flight to one of the two - body final states @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "observation of a @xmath19 in an event signals , or tags , the presence of a @xmath20 and vice versa ; highly pure and nearly monochromatic @xmath24 beams can thus be obtained and exploited to achieve high precision in the measurement of absolute br s .",
    "the analysis of kaon decays is performed with the kloe detector , consisting essentially of a drift chamber , dc , surrounded by an electromagnetic calorimeter , emc .",
    "a superconducting coil provides a 0.52  t magnetic field .",
    "the dc  @xcite is a cylinder of 4  m in diameter and 3.3  m in length , which constitutes a fiducial volume for @xmath25 and @xmath24 decays extending up to @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the momentum resolution for tracks at large polar angle is @xmath28% .",
    "the distribution of c.m .",
    "momenta reconstructed from identification of one - prong @xmath29 decay vertices in the dc shows a peak around the expected value with a resolution of 11.5  mev , thus allowing clean @xmath30 tagging .",

    "the emc is readout at both ends by photomultiplier tubes .",

    "their timing provide the arrival times of particles and the three - dimensional positions of the energy deposits are determined from the signal at the two ends .",
    "the readout granularity is @xmath31  @xmath32 , with 2440 `` cells '' arranged in layers five - deep .",
    "cells close in time and space are grouped into a `` calorimeter cluster . '' for each cluster , the energy @xmath33 is the sum of the cell energies , and the time @xmath34 and position @xmath35 are calculated as energy - weighted averages over the fired cells .",
    "the energy and time resolutions are @xmath36 and @xmath37  54  ps@xmath38 ps , respectively .",
    "the timing capabilities of the emc are exploited to precisely reconstruct the position of decay vertices of @xmath24 to @xmath39 s from the cluster times of the emitted photons , thus allowing precise measurements of the @xmath24 lifetime . in early 2006 , the kloe experiment completed data taking , having collected @xmath40  fb@xmath2 of integrated luminosity at the @xmath3 peak , corresponding to @xmath63.6 billion @xmath41 pairs . the preliminary result presented here",
    "is based on the analysis of 1700  pb@xmath2 .",
    "a monte carlo ( mc ) data set was produced on a run - by - run basis , with luminosity scale factors equal to 1 for the main @xmath24 decay channels and 100 for decay channels with br s less than 10@xmath42 .",
    "given the @xmath24 decay length of @xmath690  cm , the selection of one - prong @xmath43 decays in the dc required to tag @xmath44 has an efficiency smaller than 50% . in order to keep the statistical uncertainty on the number of @xmath7counts below 1%",
    ", we decided to perform a `` direct search '' for @xmath7and @xmath45decays , without tagging .",
    "since we measure a ratio of br s for two channels with similar topology and kinematics , we expect to benefit from some cancellation of the uncertainties on tracking , vertexing , and kinematic identification efficiencies .",
    "small deviations in the efficiency due to the different masses of electrons and muons can be evaluated using mc .",
    "selection starts requiring the presence of a one - prong decay vertex of a kaon track in a fiducial volume ( fv ) in the dc consisting of a track with laboratory momentum between 70 and 130  mev , which can be extrapolated backward to a region near the interaction point , and a secondary track of relatively high momentum ( between 180 and 270  mev ) .",
    "the fv is defined as a cylinder parallel to the beam axis with length of 80  cm , and inner and outer radii of 40 and 150  cm , respectively .",
    "quality cuts are applied using @xmath46-like variables for the tracking of kaon and secondary particle and for the vertex fit .",
    "these requirements are referred to as the `` one - prong selection '' in the following .",
    "a powerful kinematic variable used to distinguish @xmath7and @xmath45decays from the background is calculated from the momenta of the kaon and the secondary particle measured in dc : assuming zero neutrino mass one can obtain the squared mass of the secondary particle , or lepton mass ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the distribution of @xmath47 is shown in fig .",
    "[ ke2:mlep ] for mc events before and after quality cuts are applied .",
    "while the one - prong selection is enough for clean identification of a @xmath45sample , further rejection is needed in order to identify @xmath7events : the background , which is dominated by badly reconstructed @xmath45events , is reduced by a factor of @xmath610 by the quality cuts , but still remains @xmath610 times more frequent than the signal in the region around the electron mass peak .",
    "the one - prong selection efficiency is @xmath48 for both channels , and the ratio of efficiencies for @xmath45and @xmath7is evaluated from mc to be : @xmath49 .",
    "a correction to this estimate accounting for possible differences in the tracking performance between data and mc is discussed in sec .",

    "the associated cluster is close to the emc surface so that its position projected along the track @xmath54 is only a few cm .",
    "moreover , for electrons the cluster energy @xmath33 is a measurement of the particle momentum @xmath55 .",
    "therefore the following condition is required in the plane @xmath56 vs @xmath57 ( see fig .  [ ke2:ell ] ) : @xmath58 - 2.6}{2.6}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{e_\\mathrm{cl}/p_\\mathrm{ext}-0.94}{0.2}\\right)^2<2.5.\\ ] ]    electron clusters can be further distinguished from @xmath14 ( or @xmath59 ) clusters by exploiting the granularity of the emc : electrons shower and deposit their energy mainly in the first plane of emc , while muons behave like minimum ionizing particles in the first plane while they deposit a sizable fraction of their kinetic energy from the third plane onward when they are slowed down to rest ( bragg peak ) .",
    "the particle identification ( pid ) was therefore based on the asymmetry @xmath60 of energy deposits between the second and the first planes hit , on the spread @xmath61 of energy deposits on each plane , on the position @xmath62 of the plane with the maximum energy , and on the asymmetry @xmath63 of energy deposits between the last and the next - to - last planes .",
    "muon clusters with the signature @xmath64 , or @xmath65  cm , or @xmath66 are rejected .",
    "the pid technique described above selects @xmath7events with an efficiency @xmath67 and a rejection power for background of about 300 .",

    "the present pdg value has been used for the ratio of ib and de contributions : @xmath73  @xcite .",
    "the fit has been repeated with different values of this ratio , varied within its range of uncertainty .",
    "this procedure gave a @xmath60.45% error on the number of signal counts .",
    "the number of @xmath45events in the same data set is extracted from a similar fit to the @xmath47 distribution , where no pid cuts are applied in this case .",
    "the fraction of background events under the muon peak is estimated from mc to be less than one per mil .",
    "the number of @xmath45events is 499251584@xmath7435403 .",
    "the following formula has been used to evaluate the ratio @xmath9 : @xmath75 \\left[c^\\mathrm{trk } \\frac{\\epsilon^\\mathrm{trk}_{k\\mu2}}{\\epsilon^\\mathrm{trk}_{ke2}}\\right ] \\left[\\frac{1}{c^\\mathrm{pid}\\epsilon^\\mathrm{pid}_{ke2}}\\right ] \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^\\mathrm{ib}},\\label{eq : ratio}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the number of @xmath7and @xmath45observed events ; @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the efficiencies for the one - prong selection for @xmath7and @xmath45decays , evaluated from mc ; the correction @xmath80 to their ratio accounts for possible differences between the data and the mc prediction . the pid efficiency for @xmath7events",
    "@xmath81 has been evaluated from mc , while a correction @xmath82 has been evaluated to account for possible discrepancies between data and mc in the description of pid variables .",

    "the estimates of the above efficiencies and corrections are briefly discussed in the following section . finally , @xmath84 is the fraction of the ib component accepted in the selection of @xmath7events and has been evaluated from mc",
    ".      the mc estimates for @xmath85 have been checked using a control sample of @xmath45events .",
    "this sample has been selected by requiring a tagging two - body kaon decay in the dc and by identifying a secondary muon cluster coming from a @xmath45decay of the other kaon . in this sample ,",
    "the kaon decay vertex and the laboratory momentum of the emitted muon are evaluated using the information from the tag and from the selected cluster with resolutions of 5  cm and 13  mev , respectively .",
    "we evaluated from this sample @xmath85 for both data and mc , as a function of the laboratory momentum of the secondary particle and the position of the one - prong vertex . convoluting the data / mc ratio with the @xmath7and @xmath45kinematics , we get a correction @xmath86 for the ratio @xmath87 .",
    "only 10  pb@xmath2 have been used to obtain this estimate .",
    "the quoted statistical error will be reduced to a negligible level after processing of the entire statistics .      in order to check the reliability of the mc for the efficiency estimate ,",
    "a control sample ( cs ) of @xmath88 decays has been selected and used to compare data with mc .",
    "using 600 pb@xmath2 of integrated luminosity about 200k @xmath88 events with a purity of 99.7% have been selected .",
    "the ratio of data and mc pid efficiencies has been evaluated as function of the electron momentum and impact angle on the emc , separately for the barrel and endcap parts of the emc .",
    "the correction for pid is @xmath89 where the first error is due to the statistics of the cs and the second is due to the incomplete kinematic coverage of the cs .      the trigger efficiencies for @xmath7and @xmath45are evaluated from data , by comparing two almost independent trigger algorithms based on dc and emc information .",
    "the correlation between these two triggers is topological in nature , and has been evaluated from mc .",
    "the dependence of the ratio of trigger efficiencies on the data taking period has been studied : the evaluated trigger efficiency ratio is stable well below the 1% level , and is independent of the run conditions .",
    "the ratio between the trigger efficiencies for the @xmath7and @xmath45processes is @xmath90 where again the first and second errors are statistical and systematic , respectively .      using the number of observed @xmath7and @xmath45events and all corrections as in eq .",
    "[ eq : ratio ] , we get the preliminary result @xmath91 this value is compatible within the error with the sm prediction , @xmath92",
    "three sources contribute to the present statistical uncertainty of 1.9% : fluctuation in the signal counts ( 1.1% ) , fluctuation in the background to be subtracted ( 0.7% ) , and statistical error on the mc estimate of the background ( 1.4% ) .",
    "the dominant source is the latter , because the selection efficiency for badly reconstructed @xmath45events is lower in mc than in data , so that the mc background under the @xmath7peak ( the solid histogram of fig .",
    "[ ke2:fit ] ) had to be scaled by a factor of 4 to match the level of background in data .",
    "three improvements will be used to lower the statistical uncertainty on @xmath9 : first , a factor of 30% more data still have to be analyzed ; second , mc production in progress will increase the mc statistics by a factor of two ; third , various improvements will be performed to the selection algorithm in order to increase the background rejection power , at least by a factor of two .    the uncertainty on the pid efficiency is 1.75% and is the dominant contribution to the present systematic error .",
    "the cs statistics will be improved by a factor of four and additional studies of pid methods are needed to reduce the purely systematic contribution from 1.5% down to less than 1% . the current uncertainty on the one - prong selection efficiency is 0.9% and is dominated by the statistics of the control sample used ( only 10  pb@xmath2 ) .",
    "using additional statistics this error will be pushed down to below 0.5% .",
    "additional studies of the data / mc agreement on trigger variables for reconstructed events are needed in order to increase the statistics of signal events for trigger efficiency evaluation .",
    "significant progress toward the 1% goal is expected to come from the use of an additional sample of @xmath7events in which the kaon decays before the inner dc wall .",
    "these events can be selected using tag information , by extrapolating the kaon trajectory known from the tagging kaon from the ip to the point of closest approach with a secondary track reconstructed in the first layers of the dc .",
