    "this phenomenon has been compared @xcite with resonance cones in plasma physics @xcite .",
    "while such a propagation behavior resembles that in the perfect lenses proposed in the previous sections , the zero transverse permittivity causes significant impedance mismatch between the metamaterial and free space , because resonance cones are well known to be quasi - electrostatic waves and have an infinitesimal magnetic field @xcite .",

    "the waves become completely electric and longitudinal , with the electric field parallel to the wave vector .",
    "since the magnetic boundary condition requires the magnetic field to be continuous across the interface between the metamaterial and free space , but the magnetic field of the longitudinal - electric ( le ) waves is zero , tm waves in free space can not be coupled into the le waves inside the slab and must be completely reflected at the boundary . by reciprocity , the le waves , once excited inside the slab , also can not be coupled into free space at all .",

    "is completely unable to transmit an arbitrary tm image in and out of free space .",
    "this impedance mismatch problem is especially severe for magnifying superlenses , since one would be unable to observe the magnified image in the far field , while any observed far - field radiation can only be due to imperfections in the metamaterial implementation .        to partially overcome the impedance mismatch problem , it is more desirable to make @xmath125 nonzero and @xmath126 instead .",
    "the wave equation in terms of @xmath108 inside the metamaterial becomes @xmath127 and is independent of the transverse spatial profile of the fields .",
    "the other conditions on the fields are @xmath128 resulting in transverse - electric - magnetic ( tem ) waves , with a poynting vector in the @xmath36 direction regardless of the transverse spatial profile .",
