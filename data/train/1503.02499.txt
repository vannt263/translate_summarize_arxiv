    "<S> , the locking of @xmath59 leads to @xmath60 .    physical picture becomes clear when we take the particle - hole description . </S>",

    "<S> the preceding theories implicitly assumed the incommensurate @xmath73 and ignored @xmath72  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> there is no principal reason to rule out the possibility . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the situation where the condition holds .    since quantum wires are usually far below the unity filling ( i.e. @xmath74 ) , large @xmath63 is requisite for satisfying eq .  . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the relevance of the cosine interaction is reduced . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the cosine interaction @xmath72 has a scaling dimension @xmath75 , and @xmath76 is required in order to lock @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> larger @xmath63 makes it more difficult to achieve @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast the positive drag does not require the large @xmath63 because the condition is easily satisfied for @xmath78 . </S>",

    "<S> the strong repulsion @xmath79 is necessary for the negative drag .    </S>",
    "<S> let us show that the long - range intrawire and interwire coulomb interactions are the keys for realization of the condition @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> the intrawire coulomb interaction @xmath80 renormalizes @xmath11 and @xmath12 as follows . </S>",
    "<S> it generates the kinetic term @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the fourier transform of @xmath83 . when the electron density is low enough , the coulomb interaction is unscreened and divergent at @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> such a divergence at long distance is crucial to the drag current flowing through the whole wire . in order to include the effect of the cut - off of the divergence due to the finite length of the wires , we model the intrawire interaction as @xmath85  @xcite , where @xmath86 is the dielectric constant of the wires . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath91 is the fermi velocity of the free electron . </S>",
    "<S> since the coulomb interaction in 1d diverges at both long and short distances , the tll parameter depends on both @xmath4 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the relation shows that we can control the strength of repulsion of the tll by changing geometrical parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the circuit . </S>",
    "<S> one can find a similar argument in refs .  .    </S>",

    "<S> the effective @xmath94 independence of @xmath95 allows us to replace it to an effective short - range interaction @xmath96 in the low - energy limit @xmath84 , which gives the strength @xmath97 of the cosine interaction .    </S>",

    "<S> ] can become arbitrally small , the condition @xmath79 for the negative drag can be satisfied with the aid of the long - range intrawire coulomb interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> let us discuss major factors that disturb the negative drag . </S>",
    "<S> they are the temperature and the incommensurability . </S>",
    "<S> first we estimate the temperature effect . under the condition , the symmetric mode acquires an energy gap for @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> we can easily see that an expansion @xmath104 around a bottom @xmath105 of the cosine @xmath72 generates the quadratic mass term  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however the locking is weakened by instantons that represents the tunneling of neighboring locking values of @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in order to have coulomb drag , the excitation of instantons should be suppressed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately the exact excitation spectrum of the instanton is available  @xcite , which is composed of a soliton and an antisoliton . </S>",
    "<S> their excitation gap , @xmath107 , is exactly derived  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we can suppress thermal excitations of the instanton at @xmath108^{1/2}.    \\label{no_soliton}\\ ] ] then @xmath77 is well locked to the bottom @xmath109 . as we discussed , the negative drag occurs when @xmath110 and @xmath111 are satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> given @xmath112 , the gap @xmath107 becomes large and then the temperature range is wide enough for experimental realizations </S>",
    "<S> .    next we estimate robustness of the negative drag against the incommensurability . </S>",
    "<S> let us displace @xmath73 from the commensurate value . </S>",
    "<S> we use @xmath113 as a measure of the displacement . </S>",
    "<S> nonzero @xmath114 adds the incommensurate oscillation @xmath115 to the cosine interaction , which disturbs the coherence of @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> let us write the lowest - energy excitation gap of @xmath77 as @xmath116 ( @xmath117 )  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> when @xmath119 , the oscillation is very slow over the length @xmath118 , and the locking by @xmath72 persists . on the other hand , when @xmath120 , the oscillation dissolves the locking . </S>",

    "<S> furthermore , in order to realize the negative drag , the positive drag should be suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> since the positive drag is stabilized for @xmath124 for @xmath123 , the electron densities must break the inequality . </S>",

    "<S> inclusion of the spin degree of freedom doubles it to @xmath136 , which is basically consistent with experiments  @xcite . </S>",
