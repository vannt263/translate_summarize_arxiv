    "chaotic scattering is a phenomenon which appears in many scientific fields , such as astronomy , electromagnetism , statistical mechanics , chemistry , quantum mechanics , just to mention a few .",
    "two objects that are separated initially by some distance , come closer , interact with each other for a while and then they separate again .",
    "more specifically , in astronomy , chaotic scattering can be found in many situations , such as , for example , in the formation and evolution of the outer solar system ( e.g. [ 1 ] ) , in planetary rings ( e.g. [ 11 ] ) , in exosolar planetary systems ( e.g. [ 4 ] ) , in the dynamical evolution of globular clusters ( e.g. [ 3 ] ) . regarding the last situation ,",
    "stars are expected to escape from a globular cluster due to a variety of dynamical processes , such as two body relaxation or an external tidal field .",
    "this theoretical prediction has also been confirmed by observations ( e.g. [ 9 ] ) .",
    "it is important to know whether a star will escape from a cluster and also the timescale on which that will happen as it affects the scaling of the n - body simulation results ( normally , the number n of stars used by a simulation is less than the number of stars of the cluster under study ) and reduce the computational effort required to perform a simulation . also , the timescale of escape is important when one uses monte carlo models in order to study the dynamical evolution of globular clusters .",
    "further reasons regarding the importance of escape in globular clusters are discussed in [ 6 ] .",
    "a star can escape from a cluster when its energy exceeds some critical threshold but escape may not occur immediately .",
    "numerical simulations show that it may take a long time for a star to escape or it may not even escape at all ( escape on a timescale comparable with the age of the universe falls into this category too ) .",
    "the assumption of rapid escape referred to in [ 5 ] and [ 2 ] is therefore a significant source of error for theoretical predictions regarding the evolution of globular clusters .",
    "interest has therefore been generated in the dynamics underpinning the escape mechanism .",
    "petit and h@xmath0non [ 10 ] investigated numerically the motion of two satellites around a planet . however , certain difficulties arose in their study and in order to overcome those difficulties , h@xmath0non [ 8 ] devised a model problem which demonstrated similar behaviour to the satellite problem but it was easier to study .",
    "that model consisted of an inclined billiard , i.e. a point particle bouncing on two fixed disks and a two dimensional mapping was used to describe the dynamics of the model .    in the present paper , we extend the results obtained in [ 8 ] by deriving an analytical expression for the escape distribution of a particular class of orbits , the so called h - orbits .",
    "the structure of the paper is roughly as follows : first , we give a description of the model developed by h@xmath0non ( sec .",
    "then we obtain an analytical expression for the escape distribution of the h - orbits and the formula is compared with results from numerical simulations ( sec .",
    "next , there is some discussion about the billiard model and hill s problem , which originally inspired h@xmath0non to devise the inclined billiard model ( sec .",
    "finally , the last section of the paper gives a brief summary .",
    "h@xmath0non s model is described as follows : a point particle moves in the ( x , y ) plane and bounces elastically on two fixed disks of radius @xmath1 whose centres are located at @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , the particle is subject to a constant acceleration @xmath4 in the negative @xmath5 direction . for reasons of simplicity , @xmath1 is considered to be large , an assumption which means that the two disks overlap .    a one parameter family of orbits , the so called h - orbits , is defined by assuming that the particle is dropped from rest at @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 is a positive constant which fixes the energy and @xmath8 is a variable . for those orbits ,",
    "there are intervals of @xmath8 in which the orbit changes continuously and there are also critical values of @xmath8 at which a transition in behaviour is observed .",
    "for @xmath9 the particle bounces ad infinitum on the right disk , while for @xmath10 the particle bounces ad infinitum on the left disk .",
    "if the particle is dropped either to the left of the left disk or to the right of the right disk , then the particle escapes and never returns .",
    "if the particle is dropped either to the right of the left disk or to the left of the right disk , then the particle exhibits a more complex behaviour , bouncing from one disk to another .",
    "hence , the values @xmath11 are associated with a transition . in general , transitions are present at values of @xmath8 which lead to solutions which approach asymptotically one of the @xmath11 orbits .",
    "a convenient way of dealing with the problem is to introduce a two dimensional explicit mapping , which is equivalent to studying a hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom .",
    "details about the mapping and its properties can be found in [ 8 ] . if @xmath12 is the position of the particle on the @xmath13th rebound , then the two dimensional mapping , keeping the notation of [ 8 ] , is the following :    @xmath14    @xmath15 is defined by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the transverse velocity , @xmath18 is the total energy and @xmath19 is a dimensionless parameter defined by @xmath20 finally , @xmath21 .",
    "if the mapping is applied repeatedly , we obtain : @xmath22}}{\\cosh{\\frac{\\phi}{2}}}-2\\tanh{\\frac{\\phi}{2 } } \\sum^{n-1}_{j=1}s_{j}\\sinh{[(n - j)\\phi]},\\\\ w_{n } & = & \\frac{h\\sinh{[(n-\\frac{1}{2})\\phi]}}{\\cosh{\\frac{\\phi}{2}}}-2\\tanh{\\frac{\\phi}{2 } } \\sum^{n-1}_{j=1}s_{j}\\sinh{[(n - j)\\phi]}-s_{n}\\tanh{\\frac{\\phi}{2}}\\nonumber.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    a given h - orbit is associated to a sequence of binary digits ( 0 or 1 depending on whether the particle bounces on the left or right disk respectively ) and the corresponding to that sequence number a , with @xmath23 .",
    "an h - orbit changes continuously within an interval of continuity . in that interval ,",
    "the sequence of rebounds remains the same throughout the whole of this interval .",
    "this means that the value of a is constant .",
    "if a is plotted as a function of h ( for a fixed value of @xmath19 ) a fractal picture is generated .",
    "this has the appearance of the devil s staircase , which consinsts of an infinite number of horizontal bars .",
    "each bar corresponds to an interval of continuity , meaning that when a particle starts within that interval , it will follow the same orbit in terms of which disk it bounces on .",
    "such an example is given in fig.1 .",
    "after the brief introduction to h@xmath0non s model , we are going to obtain an expression for the number of bounces it takes for an h - orbit to escape from the system .",
    "the derivation will apply for @xmath24 or @xmath25 . when @xmath26 , the devil s staircase is not continuous any longer and gaps appear between the horizontal bars , i.e. there exist values of @xmath27 to which no h - orbits correspond .",
    "also , many of the assumptions made about the h - orbits do not hold .",
    "more details about that situation can be found in [ 8 ] , although , for reasons not known to us , h@xmath0non only refers to properties regarding @xmath28 .",
    "the mapping given by eqs ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) has two fixed points ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) , each one with eigenvalues @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which suggests that when @xmath33 , we get at the same time @xmath34 . for @xmath35 ,",
    "all the points of the mapping are fixed points . however , as stated in [ 8 ] , it is not clear whether the peculiarities of the @xmath26 case have general relevance to the problem of chaotic scattering .",
    "the time to escape , for a given value of h , is the smallest integer @xmath36 such that @xmath37 for all @xmath38 . in particular",
    ", we would like to know which values of h , i.e. which sub - intervals of @xmath39 , correspond to orbits which escape after at least @xmath36 bounces within the constrained region ( @xmath40 ) . by summing up the lengths of these sub - intervals it is possible to produce an escape distribution .    according to [ 8 ] , at each end of every horizontal bar",
    "there are left and right asymptotic orbits corresponding to @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively , where @xmath43 is associated with each horizontal bar ( p - bar ) , indicating the number of digits which occurred in the binary sequence before the repetition of either zeros or ones , i.e. before the particle escapes over the left or right disk .",
    "those orbits take infinitely many bounces to escape .",
    "if we move away from those extremes and consider @xmath44 or @xmath45 , we find orbits which escape after a finite number of bounces .",
    "the smaller @xmath46 is , the longer it takes for an orbit to escape ( more precisely , @xmath47 ) . for values of h in the interval @xmath48 , for a given p - bar",
    ", the number of bounces never falls below p.    in order to find those intervals of @xmath8 which correspond to orbits that remain bound for at least @xmath36 bounces , we require to sum together the full lengths of the horizontal bars for which @xmath49 .",
    "only partial contributions will be required from the bars with @xmath50 .",
    "this is because some values of @xmath8 near the centre of these bars lead to orbits which escape too rapidly ( under @xmath36 bounces ) .",
    "the whole calculation may be performed in the following three steps : + i ) calculating the partial contribution from a bar with @xmath50 by finding an expression for the time to escape , @xmath36 , as a function of @xmath46 .",
    "this expression may be inverted to yield @xmath46 as a function of @xmath36 .",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) , @xmath87-orbits were evolved forward in time and for each @xmath87-orbit , we found the minimum number of iterations @xmath88 required to satisfy @xmath89 .",
    "an escape distribution is built up by determining what fraction of the @xmath87-orbits escaped on the first bounce , on the second bounce and so on .",
    "the simulations were done for different values of @xmath19 and @xmath90 .",
    "the value of @xmath91 was even increased to @xmath92 to ensure that the results were independent of the number of subdivisions .",
    "fig.2 shows the escape distribution for different values of @xmath19 , both analytical [ eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) ] and numerical .",
    "the numerical results are in excellent agreement with those obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "there is only a small range of @xmath31 for which there is some discrepancy between the numerical and the analytical results for some p - bars .",

    "when @xmath96 or @xmath97 , our analytical result needs some correction , i.e. the difference in bar length @xmath98 or @xmath99 .",
    "for example , also visible in fig.2 , for @xmath28 and @xmath100 our analytical result is around @xmath101 larger than the numerical one and that happens because our calculation overestimates the contribution of the left side of the @xmath102 bar ( for @xmath103 ; for @xmath104 is the right side of the @xmath102 bar that exhibits some problem ) . for @xmath105 ,",
    "the error for @xmath100 reduces to around @xmath106 .",

    "the correction is : @xmath107",
    "as it was stated in the introduction , h@xmath0non s billiard model was inspired by [ 10 ] , which dealt with the interaction of two satellites around a planet .",
    "that study was done in the context of the so called hill s problem , a special case of the restricted three body problem where the massless particle moves in the neighbourhood of the secondary body .",
    "originally intended as a model for the motion of the moon around the earth with perturbations by the sun , with some modification it can also serve as a simplified model of the dynamical behaviour of escaping stars in globular clusters [ 7 ] . in that case , the centre of the galaxy and the globular cluster play the role of the two main bodies , while the star is treated as the massless particle .",
    "let us assume that the cluster moves on a circular orbit of radius @xmath108 around the centre of the galaxy with constant angular velocity , the mass of the cluster with respect to the galaxy is assumed to be small , the mass of the star is considered to be negligible compared to that of the cluster and all three bodies lie in the same plane .",
    "if we consider a coordinate system that rotates with the angular velocity of the cluster around the galaxy and with its origin being at the cluster , hill s equations can be written as follows [ 13 ] : @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the @xmath112 and @xmath113 coordinates of the star and @xmath114 .",
    "note that the above equations have been scaled in terms of time and distance . in the above mentioned coordinate system ,",
    "the two lagrangian points of interest occur at @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "one recalls that in our inclined billiard model , the particle was dropped with zero horizontal velocity onto the inclined surface from a fixed height , i.e. with constant @xmath19 for various @xmath8 in the interval ( -1,1 ) . in hill",
    "s problem , the h - orbits can be defined to be those with initial conditions given by @xmath117 at a fixed value of the initial hamiltonian @xmath118 ( analogous to the condition of constant @xmath19 in h@xmath0non s model ) , @xmath119 is calculated from @xmath120    each time the orbit intersects the surface of section @xmath121 ( with @xmath122 when @xmath123 and with @xmath124 when @xmath125 ) , the value of @xmath110 is recorded . if @xmath126 on the @xmath13th intersection with the surface of section , then the orbit may be represented symbolically by a sequence @xmath127 , where @xmath128 if the orbit escapes through the right lagrangian point after @xmath36 intersections with the surface of section , then @xmath129 .",
    "similarly , if the orbit escapes through the left lagrangian point after @xmath36 intersections with the surface of section , then @xmath130 . hence a real number can be attached to a given orbit in a similar way as it was done for the inclined billiard model .",
    "fig.3 is an example of an h - orbit in hill s problem , exhibiting similar features to those found in fig . 1 .",
    "h@xmath0non [ 8 ] used an inclined billiard in order to investigate the phenomenon of chaotic scattering . a point particle , initially at rest , fell from a certain height and bounced elastically off the surface of two disks .",
    "when the particle bounced beyond the top of either disk , it was considered to have escaped . by assigning a number @xmath27 to the orbit of the particle",
    ", we were able to plot @xmath131 , where @xmath8 ( @xmath132 ) was the initial value of the x - coordinate of the particle .",
    "for certain values of the parameter @xmath19 , which was related to the particle energy , the graphical representation of @xmath131 had the form of the so - called devil s staircase .",
    "based on certain properties of the devil s staircase , we were able to derive an analytical expression for the number of particles that escaped after at least @xmath36 bounces .",
    "it may be possible to approach the issue of stars escaping from a cluster or other similar situations by using the billiard model as a simplification of hill s problem .",
    "therefore , our future aim is to investigate the possibility of connecting the billiard model and hill s problem in a way that can be used to describe a more complex situation such as for example the dynamical evolution of a star within a globular cluster .",
    "the latter is far more complicated as a system than the inclined billiard we have studied , but many times , it is possible to get a good approximation of a complicated system by following a more simple approach to the problem .",
