    "let us consider a @xmath0-layer multiplex network of @xmath1 nodes , i.e. a multi - layer graph in which each node can interact with the other ones by means of @xmath0 different kinds of relationships .",

    "in particular , we consider the class of markovian random walks defined by the transition probabilities : @xmath10 this set up is very general and allows for a variety of different motion rules .",
    "in fact , @xmath11 can be either a function of some topological multiplex properties of the arrival node @xmath6 , or an informative combination of some structural features of the destination node , measured at all or at a fraction of the layers .",
    "notice that the unbiased random walk on the multiplex is obtained by setting @xmath12 . in this case",
    "a walker jumps out of node @xmath5 by traversing one of the edges incident on @xmath5 chosen with uniform probability and independently on the layer to which it belongs .",
    "it is worth noting that the use of the overlapping adjacency matrix @xmath13 does not automatically make the walk in eq .",
    "( [ eq : walk ] ) equivalent to a random walk on the aggregated graph obtained by flattening all the layers in a single network . in general , if the biasing function @xmath14 depends , either explicitly or implicitly , on the structural properties of node @xmath6 in the multiplex network , the walk in eq .",
    "( [ eq : walk ] ) can not be directly mapped on an equivalent walk on the aggregated graph .    _ stationary probability distribution .  _ starting from the one - step transition probability given in eq .",
    "[ eq : walk ] we derive closed forms for several asymptotic properties of the walk . following an approach similar to that used in ref .",
    "@xcite , we now show that for any choice of the biasing function @xmath11 the stationary probability distribution @xmath15 of biased walks on multiplex networks can be analytically derived , under the hypotheses that _",
    "i ) _ the topological overlapping matrix @xmath16 is primitive and that _ ii ) _ @xmath11 is a time - invariant function of any property of the destination node @xmath6 .",
    "we start by considering the probability @xmath17 that a walker starting at node @xmath5 will be found on node @xmath6 after exactly @xmath18 time steps : @xmath19 and the dual probability @xmath20 : @xmath21 comparing eq .",
    "( [ eq : pij ] ) with eq .",

    "( [ eq : stationary ] ) is quite general , since it does not explicitly depend on the form of the biasing function or on the actual structure of each layer or of the topological overlapping matrix @xmath25 .    in many real - world application scenarios , e.g. in crawling the structure of online social networks ,",
    "it is important to guarantee that for long enough times the walk will end up visiting all the nodes of the graph with the same probability .",
    "it is easy to prove that an unbiased random walk is not a good choice in this case , since its steady - state occupation probability distribution is proportional to the degree sequence , hence an appropriate bias should be used to avoid to visit hubs more frequently than poorly - connected nodes . in practice , it is not always possible to find a walk which produces exactly the same stationary occupation probability distribution for all the nodes , i.e. @xmath30 .",
    "however , one could instead require that the resulting stationary probability distribution , although not equal for all nodes , has the minimum possible variance .",
    "in particular , in the following we will focus on the normalised standard deviation of the stationary probability distribution : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the average and the standard deviation of @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "we will look for suitable combinations of the parameters of the walk that produce the smallest possible value of @xmath35 , corresponding to the maximum uniformity of the accessibility of the nodes attainable on a certain multiplex network .",
    "_ entropy rate .",
    " _ one classical measure to quantify the mixedness or dispersiveness of a walk on a graph is the entropy rate @xmath36  @xcite , where @xmath37 is the shannon entropy of the set of all the trajectories of length @xmath18 generated from the walk rule , and @xmath38 is the minimum amount of information necessary to describe the process  @xcite . in particular , @xmath39 only if the walk generates exactly one possible trajectory , while @xmath38 is maximum when all the trajectories are equiprobable .",
    "intuitively , walks with a high mixedness can explore remote regions of a graph within a relatively small number of time - steps .",
    "this property is again desirable for the efficient exploration of unknown networks , where only local information is available . in particular , it is interesting to find a biasing function which guarantees that the walk does not remain trapped for too long in any region of the graph , and this is usually obtained by maximising the dispersiveness of the walk .",
    "it is possible to show that the entropy rate for a markov process can be expressed as @xmath40 which means that @xmath38 depends only on the walk rule @xmath41 and on the stationary probability distribution  @xcite . by substituting the analytical expression for @xmath42 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : stationary ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eqentropyrate ] ) we get : @xmath43.\\ ] ] this expression has a natural upper bound , which reflects the case of random walks where all trajectories of the same length have equal probability .",
    "it is interesting to notice that , as shown by burda et al . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the maximal value of entropy rate attainable by any walk on a given single - layer graph depends on the structure of the graph , and in particular for an undirected graph it is equal to @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the maximum eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the graph .    this result can be extended to the case of walks on multiplex networks as follows . the total number of trajectories of length @xmath18 generated by a walk defined as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : walk ] ) is equal to @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the @xmath18-th power of the overlapping adjacency matrix . in the limit of large @xmath18",

    "since obtaining high mixedness is a desirable property of a walk in many real - world applications , such as when searching for a given resource on a graph , in the following we will look for combinations of the parameters of different motion rules which can produce high values of @xmath38 , to better approximate the corresponding value of @xmath50 allowed by the structure of the network .    _",

    "let us consider a heterogeneous mean - field , in which all the nodes belonging to the same degree class @xmath54 are structurally indistinguishable . under these assumption , and",
    "since @xmath51 depends only on the degree , then for all the nodes @xmath5 having the same degree @xmath55 we have @xmath56 , but also @xmath57 , and similarly : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is an appropriate normalisation constant to ensure that @xmath60 .",

    "since the heterogeneous mean - field discards intra - layer and edge correlations , which usually contribute to hinder the dispersiveness of a walk , eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_star_k ] ) can be readily plugged into the expression of the entropy rate in eq .",
    "( [ eqentropyrate ] ) to obtain an estimate of the maximum value of @xmath38 attainable with a given biasing function on a multiplex network with an assigned multiplex degree sequence @xmath73 .",
    "the introduction of a biasing function in the motion rule is mainly motivated by the necessity to obtain an exploration of the graph which is more efficient , i.e. , faster with respect to the time needed to visit all the nodes , or more homogeneous , i.e. , avoiding heterogeneities in the stationary distribution probability , in order to explore with the same probability each node of the graph . in single layer networks",
    "these two aims are in general antithetical . for instance , a biasing function which maximises the mixing of the walk ( corresponding to higher values of entropy rate ) usually produces a quite heterogeneous stationary occupation probability , mainly due to the fact that a better mixing is obtained by exploiting the central role played by hubs .",
    "high values of @xmath38 are usually achieved in a single - layer uncorrelated graph by a degree - biased walk @xmath74 with @xmath75 , and in general with a bias @xmath76 in graphs with non - trivial degree - degree correlations  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a uniform stationary occupation probability is obtained by using @xmath77 with @xmath78 in uncorrelated graphs , and in general by a value of @xmath79 for graphs with degree - degree correlations , which corresponds to forcing the walkers to preferentially move towards poorly connected nodes  @xcite .",
    "the richness of multi - layer networks allows the exploration of more complex biasing functions and , as we will show in the following , usually produces quite interesting dynamics .",
    "the reason of such richness is that the multiplex degree of a node @xmath5 is a vectorial rather than a scalar quantity , a fact that allows to construct several degree - based biasing functions . in the following we present two particular classes of such biasing functions , which we call _ extensive _ and _ intensive _ biases , respectively .    _ extensive bias functions .",
    " _ we call _ extensive _ those walks whose motion rule depends on a function of the degrees of the destination node at each of the @xmath0 layers .",
    "a first example is that of _ additive _ degree - biased walks , defined by transition probabilities of the form : @xmath80}}_j)^{b_{\\alpha } }    \\label{eq : additive}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the bias exponent associated to layer @xmath7 .",
    "another example is that of _ multiplicative _ degree - biased walks , whose transition probability takes the form : @xmath82}}_j)^{b_{\\alpha}}.    \\label{eq : multiplicative}\\ ] ] we named these walks `` extensive '' since the number of free parameters in the motion rule , namely the exponents @xmath83 , increases with the number of layers @xmath0 .",
    "this peculiar property of extensive walks allows for a fine - grained setting of the bias in order to avoid nodes whose replicas on each of the @xmath0 layers belong to a specific degree class .",
    "for instance , in the case of a two - layer multiplex , if we set @xmath84 and @xmath85 then the walkers will preferentially move towards node having , at the same time , high degree on layer @xmath86 and low degree on layer @xmath87 .",
    "it might sometimes be desirable for a walker to have such sophisticated motion rules .",
    "an example is that of multiplex collaboration networks , in which nodes are scientists and layers represent co - authorship patterns in different fields . in that case",
    ", we might use an appropriately biased multiplex random walk which prefers to move towards nodes having a higher degree in a particular field , whose stationary probability distribution will represent a measure of the relative importance of each author in that field .",
    "however , having a number of parameters which scales with the number of layers is not always a desirable property , especially if one wants to tune these parameters in order to obtain a walk with certain dynamical properties ( e.g. , either in terms of stationary probability or in terms of entropy rate ) .",
    "this problem is efficiently solved by intensive bias functions .",
    "_ intensive bias functions . ",
    "_ we call _ intensive _ those multiplex walks whose motion bias depends on one or more intrinsically multiplex properties of the destination node . in the following",
    "we will focus on the intensive walk whose transition probability reads : @xmath88 where @xmath89}}_j$ ] is the overlapping degree of node @xmath6 and @xmath90 is the multiplex participation coefficient of @xmath6 , and is defined as  @xcite : @xmath91}}{o_i}\\biggr)^2\\right ] .",
    "\\label{participationcoefficient}\\ ] ] we notice that by considering @xmath92 and @xmath93 we are effectively using information about the _ distribution _ of the edges of the destination node across the layers . in particular , for fixed number of layers @xmath0 , @xmath94 is proportional to the average of the distribution defined by @xmath95}}_i , k{^{[2]}}_i , \\ldots , k{^{[m]}}_i\\}$ ] , while @xmath96 gives information about the homogeneity of @xmath97 , with @xmath98 if @xmath53}}_i\\simeq \\frac{1}{m } \\sum_{\\beta}k{^{[\\beta]}}_i \\ > \\forall \\alpha$ ] ( i.e. , if node @xmath5 has roughly the same degree at all layers ) and @xmath99 if almost all the edges of node @xmath5 lie on just one layer .",
    "we notice that when @xmath100 the walkers will preferentially move towards hubs , while for @xmath101 they tend to visit the poorly connected nodes more often .",
    "similarly , for positive values of @xmath102 the walkers will preferentially move towards _ truly multiplex nodes _ , i.e. nodes whose distribution of edges across the @xmath0 layers is more homogeneous , while for @xmath103 the walkers prefer to move towards _ focused nodes _",
    ", i.e. those having the majority of their connections in just one or a few of the @xmath0 layers  @xcite . in general , by tuning the two parameters @xmath104 and @xmath102 we can obtain a rich variety of different walks .",
    "for instance , for @xmath100 and @xmath105 , the walkers will be attracted by truly multiplex hubs ( i.e. , nodes with many links , almost equally distributed across the layers ) .",
    "conversely , when @xmath100 and @xmath103 focused hubs are visited often and multiplex poorly connected nodes are strongly avoided , and so forth .",
    "the unbiased multiplex walk is recovered for @xmath106 .",
    "the most interesting characteristic of the intensive walk defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : intensive ] ) is that the number of free parameters is fixed and does not scale with the number of layers , as instead happens for extensive walks .",
    "we will show in the following that intensive walks usually perform at least as well as extensive walks , e.g. with respect to the maximisation of entropy rate or to the minimisation of heterogeneity in the stationary occupation probability distribution .",
    "it is worth noting that in the case of a duplex , i.e. when @xmath107 , even if the number of biasing parameters in intensive and extensive walks is the same , their effect on the motion of the walkers is different . differently from @xmath108 and @xmath109",
    ", intensive biases do not allow to bias the walkers towards nodes with given properties in a particular layer but always consider intrinsically multiplex features , such as their total number of connections and their heterogeneity .    in order to explore the differences in the dynamical properties ( i.e. , the entropy rate @xmath38 and the normalised standard deviation of the stationary occupation probability distribution @xmath110 ) of biased multiplex walks , in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] we report the values of @xmath38 obtained by additive , multiplicative and intensive random walks as a function of the two bias exponents in a two - layer multiplex network whose layers have the same average degree @xmath111 and power - law degree distributions @xmath112 with @xmath113 , with no inter - layer correlations and no edge overlap of the power - law degree distribution are comparable to those shown in fig .  [ fig : fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , and are not reported for brevity . ] .",
    "we notice that also in this simple case the three walks have remarkably different behaviours .",
    "in particular , the additive walk exhibits a relative small sensitivity to the values of the biasing exponents , which results in smaller variations of @xmath38 .",

    "conversely , the picture is much richer and less trivial in the case of multiplicative and intensive walks , for which the maximum of @xmath38 is obtained for a relatively small range of parameters , usually corresponding to positive exponents .",

    ", the symmetry in the additive and multiplicative phase diagrams is broken , and the maximum values of @xmath38 are found by biasing the walk towards nodes with high degree on both layers , with a higher biasing exponent on the degree of the second layer , which has a more homogeneous degree distribution . also the phase diagram for the intensive walk is modified , with the line of maximum values becoming thinner .",
    "similar considerations hold for the phase diagram of @xmath35 , reported in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2 ] . in this case , the minimum variance ( yielding a more homogeneous exploration of nodes ) is obtained for negative values of the two bias exponents .",
    "moreover , the phase diagram exhibits quite small variations in the case of additive walk , while we observe more heterogeneity in the case of multiplicative and intensive walks .",
    "again , the symmetry of the phase diagrams of the extensive walks is broken when pairs of layers with different power - law exponents @xmath122 , @xmath123 are considered , with the region @xmath124 showing greater variations than for @xmath125 .",
    "qualitatively similar differences can be obtained with asymmetric layers with respect to other statistical properties , such as density .",
    "all the results for synthetic networks , both in the current and following sections , have been obtained for layers with @xmath126 nodes and averaged over @xmath127 realisations .",
    "in this section we illustrate how the structure of the multiplex network affects the maximal entropy rate and the minimum heterogeneity of the stationary occupation probability distribution achievable in the system .",
    "we focus on five structural aspects , namely _",
    "i ) _ the presence and sign of inter - layer degree - degree correlations , _ ii ) _ the existence of edge overlap across layers , _ iii ) _ the number @xmath0 of layers of the multiplex , _ iv ) _ the power - law exponent @xmath128 of the degree distribution of the layers , and _",

    "we show that the multiplex airline transportation networks of all the six continents have evolved towards a structure which provides a good trade - off between efficient exploration and robustness .",
    "as an application , we study here the dynamical properties of multiplex biased walks on a set of real - world systems , namely the six continental airline transportation networks . in such systems nodes represent airports , edges indicate the existence of a route between two airports and each layer is associated to an airline company , i.e. all the edges in a layer represent the routes operated by the corresponding airline .",
    "such networks have been introduced and extensively studied in ref .  @xcite . as shown in table  [ tab:1 ] , all such multiplex networks consist of a relatively high number of layers .",
    "for this reason , we will use intensive walks to compute the maximal entropy rate @xmath141 and the minimum value of the standard deviation of the stationary distribution @xmath130 . in table",
    "[ tab:1 ] , we also report for each multiplex the average number of layers @xmath160 where each edge exists , the theoretical upper value of entropy rate @xmath161 , and the values of @xmath141 and @xmath130 obtained by optimising intensive walks .",
    ".[tab:1 ] structural properties of the six continental airline transportation systems . for each multiplex",
    ", we report the number of nodes @xmath1 , the number of layers @xmath0 , the average number of layers in which an edge exists @xmath162 , the theoretical upper value of entropy rate @xmath163 and the extremal values @xmath141 and @xmath130 obtained by optimising intensive walks . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we notice that the efficiency of a transportation system is usually measured in terms of the accessibility of the locations it serves . in particular , in an ideal transportation system it should be easy to travel between any pair of far - apart regions of the network , mostly irrespective of where exactly those locations are located .",
    "now , discarding the cost associated to the distance between the nodes of an airline transportation network , high accessibility can be obtained by guaranteeing that a traveller can reach remote locations in the system without large effort , in terms of number of interchanges , and that all locations can be visited with comparable effort .",
    "we have seen that in the language of random walks these two criteria correspond , respectively , to the maximisation of dispersiveness and to the minimisation of the standard deviation of the visiting probability .",
    "hence , we can ask whether the six continental air transportation systems can guarantee a good level of navigability , i.e. an optimal trade - off between dispersiveness and homogeneity of the visiting probability .",
    "we reckon that a more informative analysis of the efficiency of these systems would require more detailed information about the actual patterns of trips travelled by passengers , the cost associated to each route , the presence of non - markovian effects ( people often come back to their original place at the end of a trip ) , the non - stationarity of the system due to seasonality , etc .. however , we argue that biased random walks can still provide useful , yet coarse - grained , information about the overall navigability of those systems . since we can not modify the degree distributions of each of the layers , or the patterns of inter - layer correlations , or the actual number of layers in each continental air transportation system , we focus here in particular on the effects of edge overlap .    in the previous section we showed",
    "that networks with high edge overlap @xmath153 achieve lower maximal values of dispersiveness of the walk and larger heterogeneity of the equilibrium occupation probability distribution .",
    "when two nodes are connected by more than one edge , indeed , from a dynamical point of the view some connections are wasted , since redundant links do not allow for new paths in the network . however , their redundancy might often be important for a transportation system , since it makes specific connections more robust to single link failures .",
    "it is not unrealistic to assume that multi - layer transportation systems from the real - world have developed by satisfying a trade - off between the necessity to provide , at the same time , high diffusivity together with reasonable levels of robustness .",
    "because of the large heterogeneity in the size and number of layers of the six continental transportation systems , it is necessary to introduce some kind of normalisation which allow to compare the results observed in different systems . in order to test the effect of edge overlap on the diffusion properties of real - world systems , for each of the six multiplex networks we computed the z - score of the average edge overlap : @xmath164 where @xmath165 and @xmath166 represent respectively the average value and the standard deviation of the overlap computed on an ensemble of suitably randomised multiplex networks . in particular , for each continental airline system we sampled @xmath127 multi - layer graphs from the configuration model which maintains fixed the degree sequence of all the layers and rearranges the links on each layer , pairing edge stubs at random .",
    "we computed also @xmath167 and @xmath168 , i.e. the z - scores of the maximal entropy rate and minimum variance over those @xmath127 multiplex graphs .",
    "the results reported in fig .  [ fig : fig5 ] confirm that also in real - world systems @xmath141 is negatively correlated with edge overlap , in agreement with the results obtained on synthetic networks .",
    "similarly , @xmath169 is positively correlated with @xmath153 .",
    "notice that we have @xmath170 in all the six continents , meaning that the edge overlap of the real - world systems is always higher than that of the null - model , in agreement with the observation that real - world transportation networks tend to guarantee a certain level of robustness to failures .",
    "however , the quest for robustness has a cost in terms of dispersiveness and accessibility . in fact , @xmath141 is consistently smaller than the value observed in the randomised systems ( @xmath171 ) for all continents , and similarly the steady - state probability distribution is consistently larger than that observed in the null model ( @xmath172 )    it is quite interesting to note that the two multiplex networks with smallest overlap and overall better diffusion properties are the continental networks of oceania and europe , which span the least geographical space .",
    "we can speculate that in such systems some nodes representing cities in different countries are connected comparably well by different modes of transport , such as trains and bus , suited for relatively short distances and not included in our analysis .",
    "this might potentially explain the relative low number of redundant edges in those two airline transportation systems .",
    "conversely , the necessity to provide route redundancy has somehow forced the airline transportation networks of asia , south america and north america towards slightly less efficient configurations .",
    "in our work we have explored how to extend biased random walks to the case of multiplex networks , showing that the richness of multi - layer systems allows to define several different classes of walks .",
    "in particular we studied the general features of the so - called extensive walkers ( where the node properties , as the degree , are considered separately at each of the layers with different biasing parameters ) and intensive walkers ( biased on of the product two intrinsically multiplex , namely the overlapping degree and the participation coefficient ) finding closed forms for the stationary occupation probability of these walks and for the entropy rate , and provided simplified heterogeneous mean - field expressions for the case in which the multiplex has no correlations .",
    "we thoroughly investigated how structural properties of the multiplex , such as its number of layers , the presence of edge overlap and/or inter - layer degree correlations , the density of the layers and the heterogeneity of their degree distribution affect the dynamics of the random walkers .",
    "we found that number of layers , edge overlap and inter - layer degree correlations have a substantial impact on the diffusion properties of the walks .",
    "also , we found that intensive random walkers perform at least as well as extensive random walkers in all the considered scenarios , with the advantage that the number of bias parameters does not scale with the number of layers .",
    "finally , the study of the diffusion properties of six real - world multiplex networks , namely the continental airline transportation networks of africa , asia , europe , oceania , north and south america , has shed some new light on the interplay between efficiency and robustness in multi - layer transportation systems . in particular",
    ", we found that the emerging necessity to provide some resilience to single link failures , which corresponds to the introduction of some level of edge overlap , has shaped these systems in such a way that their navigability , in terms of entropy rate and heterogeneity of the node occupation probability , has somehow been sacrificed in favour of robustness .",
    "the results of the present work represent a valuable theoretical contribution to the development of efficient strategies to explore , search or navigate multiplex networks , and confirm the importance of appropriately taking into account the multiplexity of interactions when modelling intrinsically multi - dimensional systems .",
