    "<S> we have shown that force generation in such entropically fuelled systems is surprisingly robust , and that the efficiency in the regime of maximum power operation exhibits novel features such as discontinuities . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed model provides , for example , an appropriate framework for describing the unfolding or refolding of a biopolymer chain under the action of an externally controlled force applied by an afm cantilever or by optical tweezers with the slow coordinate related to the end - to - end length of the polymer @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the model can also be straightforwardly generalized to systems with several coarse - grained coordinates in which larger entropic driving forces can be generated . in conclusion , our work suggests that the important question of the interplay between the energy landscape and the topology in general network structures could be successfully adressed in the future in the context of stochastic thermodynamics .    </S>",
