    "search is an important task in a wide range of applications , such as web search @xcite and product recommendations @xcite .",
    "the key of similarity search is similarity measure , which evaluates the similarity of object pairs .",
    "similarity measure has been extensively studied for traditional categorical and numerical data types , such as jaccard coefficient and cosine similarity .",
    "there are also a few studies on leveraging link information in networks to measure the node similarity , such as personalized pagerank @xcite , simrank @xcite , and pathsim @xcite .",
    "conventional study on similarity measure focuses on objects with same type .",
    "that is , the objects being measured are of the same type , such as  document - to - document \" ,  webpage - to - webpage \" and  user - to - user \" .",
    "there is seldom research on similarity measure on objects with different types .",
    "that is , the objects being measured are of different types , such as `` author - to - conference '' and `` user - to - movie '' .",
    "it is reasonable .",
    "the similarity of objects with different types is a little against our common sense .",
    "moreover , different from the similarity of objects with same type , which can be measured on homogeneous situation ( e.g. , the same feature space or homogeneous link structure ) , it is even hard to define the similarity of objects with different types .",
    "however , the similarity of objects with different types is not only meaningful but also useful in some scenarios .",
    "for example , the author j. f. naughton is more relevant to sigmod than kdd .",
    "a teenager may like the movie  harry potter \" more than  the shawshank redemption \" .",
    "moreover , the similarity measure of objects with different types are needed in many applications .",
    "for example , in a recommendation system , we need to know the relatedness between users and movies to make accurate recommendations . in an automatic profile extraction application",
    ", we need to measure the relatedness of objects with different types , such as authors and conferences , conferences and organizations etc . particularly , with the advent of study on heterogeneous information networks",
    "@xcite , it is not only increasingly important but also feasible to study the relatedness among objects with different types .",
    "heterogeneous information networks are the logical networks involving multiple - typed objects and multiple - typed links denoting different relations @xcite .",
    "for example , a bibliographic network includes authors , papers , conferences , terms and their links representing their relations .",
    "it is clear that heterogeneous information networks are ubiquitous and form a critical component of modern information infrastructure @xcite .",
    "so it is essential to provide a relevance search function on objects with different types in such networks , which is the base of many applications .",
    "since objects with different types coexist in the same network , their relevance measure is possible through link structure .    in this paper",
    ", we study the relevance search problem in heterogeneous information networks .",
    "the aim of relevance search is to effectively measure the relatedness of heterogeneous objects ( including objects with the same type or different types ) .",
    "different from the similarity search which only measures the similarity of objects with same type , the relevance search measures the relatedness of heterogeneous objects , not limit to objects with same type .",
    "distinct from relational retrieval @xcite in information retrieval domain , here relevance search is done on heterogeneous networks which can be constructed from meta - data of objects .",
    "moreover , we think that a desirable relevance measure should satisfy the symmetry property based on the following reasons .",
    "( 1 ) the symmetric measure is more general and useful in many learning tasks .",
    "although the symmetry property is not necessary in the query task , it is essential for many important tasks , such as clustering and collaborative filtering .",
    "moreover , it is the necessary condition for a metric .",
    "( 2 ) the symmetric measure makes more sense in many applications , especially for the relatedness of heterogeneous object pairs .",
    "for example , in some applications , we need to answer the question like who has the similar importance to the conference sigir as j. f. naughton to the sigmod . through comparing the relatedness of object pairs",
    ", we can deduce the information of their relative importance .",
    "however , it only can be done by the symmetric measure , not the asymmetric measure .",
    "it can be explained by the example shown in fig .",
    "[ symmrel ] . for the symmetric measure",
    ", we can deduce that w. b. croft has the same importance to sigir as j. f. naughtonnaughton/ ] to the sigmod , since their relatedness scores are close .",
    "suppose we know j. f. naughton is an influential researcher in sigmod , we can conclude that w. b. croft is also an influential researcher in sigir .",
    "however , we can not deduce the relative importance information from an asymmetric measure as shown in fig .",
    "[ symmrel](b ) . from the relatedness of author to conference and conference to author , we will draw conflicting conclusions .    despite its value and significance",
    ", the relevance search in heterogeneous networks has seldom been studied so far .",
    "it faces the following research challenges .",
    "( 1 ) heterogeneous network is much more complex than traditional homogeneous network . in heterogeneous networks , different - typed objects and links",
    "are coexist in a network and they carry different semantic meanings . as an bibliographic example shown in fig .",
    "[ hin](b ) ( more details in section v.a ) , it includes author , paper , term , and conference type .",
    "the relation `` author - paper '' means author writing paper , while the relation `` paper - conference '' means paper published in conference .",
    "if disregarding the difference of types and semantics , it does not make sense to mix different - typed objects to measure the similarity .",
    "we can find that search paths , connecting two objects through a sequence of relations between object types , embody rich semantic information @xcite . based on different search paths",
    ", the relatedness of two objects may be totally different .",
    "for example , the relatedness of authors and conferences should be different based on the `` author - paper - conference '' path and `` author - paper - author - paper - conference '' path , which mean the relations of authors publishing papers in conferences and their co - authors publishing papers in conferences , respectively . as a consequence , a desirable relevance measure should be path - dependent , since such a measure can capture the semantics under paths and return meaningful values based on different paths .",
    "( 2 ) it is difficult to design a uniform and symmetric relevance measure for heterogeneous objects . in heterogeneous networks ,",
    "the paths connecting objects with same type are usually symmetric and the path length is a even number , so it may be not difficult to design a symmetric measure based on the symmetric paths , as the pathsim @xcite does .",
    "however , the paths connecting objects with different types are asymmetric and the path length may be an odd number . in this condition , it is not easy to design a symmetric relevance measure .",
    "it is more challengeable to design a uniform relevance measure for these two conditions .    inspired by the intuition that two objects are related",
    "if they are referenced by related objects , we propose a general framework , called hetesim , to evaluate the relatedness of heterogeneous objects in heterogeneous networks .",
    "hetesim is a path - based relevance measure , which can effectively capture the subtle semantics of search paths . based on pair - wise random walk model , hetesim treats arbitrary search paths in a uniform way , which guarantees the symmetric property of hetesim .",
    "an additional benefit is that hetesim can evaluate the relatedness of objects with same or different types in the same way .",
    "moreover , hetesim is a semi - metric measure .",
    "in other words , hetesim satisfies the properties of non - negativity , identity of indiscernibles , and symmetry .",
    "it implies that hetesim can be used in many learning tasks ( e.g. , clustering and collaborative filtering ) .",
    "we also consider the computation issue of hetesim and propose four fast computation strategies .",
    "the extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of hetesim . as a general relevance measure",
    ", hetesim illustrates its benefits and generality in knowledge discovery of heterogeneous networks through four case studies : automatically extracting object profile , experts finding through relative importance of object pairs , relevance search based on path semantics , and semantic - based movie recommendation .",
    "hetesim also shows its potential in the machine learning tasks ( i.e. , query and clustering ) where hetesim outperforms other well - established similarity measures .",
    "in addition , numerous experiments test the significance of fast computing strategies of hetesim .",
    "the most related work to relevance search is similarity search . here",
    "we briefly summarize these works .",
    "similarity search has been well studied for a long time .",
    "these studies can be roughly categorized into two types : feature based approaches and link based approaches .",
    "the feature based approaches measure the similarity of objects based on their feature values , such as cosine similarity , jaccard coefficient and euclidean distance .",
    "the @xmath0 nearest neighbor is also widely used in similarity measure @xcite , which aims at finding top-@xmath0 nearest neighbors according to similarities defined on numerical features .",
    "based on feature similarity , the top-@xmath0 similarity pair search algorithm ( i.e. , top-@xmath0-join ) considers similarity between tuples @xcite .",
    "this type of approaches does not consider link relation among objects , so they can not be applied to networked data .",
    "the link based approaches measure the similarity of objects based on their link structures in a graph .",
    "the asymmetrical similarity measure , personalized pagerank @xcite , evaluates the probability starting from a source object to a target object by randomly walking with restart .",
    "it is extended to the scalable calculation for online queries @xcite and the top-@xmath0 answers @xcite .",
    "simrank @xcite is a symmetric similarity measure , which evaluates the similarity of two objects by their neighbor s similarities . because of its computational complexity",
    ", many follow - up studies are done to accelerate such calculations @xcite .",
    "scan @xcite measures similarity of two objects by comparing their immediate neighbor sets .",
    "recently , jin et al . proposed rolesim to measure the role similarity of node pair by automorphic equivalence @xcite .",
    "these approaches just consider the objects with the same type , so they can not be applied in heterogeneous networks .",
    "@xcite applies authority - based ranking to keyword search in labeled graphs and poprank @xcite proposes a domain - independent object - level link analysis model .",
    "although these two approaches noticed that heterogeneous relationships could affect the similarity , they do not consider the distinct semantics of paths that include different - typed objects , so they also can not measure the similarity of objects in heterogeneous networks .",
    "recently , the relevance research in heterogeneous data emerge .",
    "wang et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a model to learn relevance from heterogeneous data , while their model more focuses on analyzing the context of heterogeneous networks , rather than network structure .",
    "based on a markov - chain model of random walk , fouss et al .",
    "@xcite designed a similarity metric ectd with nice properties and interpretation .",
    "unfortunately , absent of path constraint , ectd can not capture the subtle semantics in heterogeneous networks .",
    "considering semantics in meta paths constituted by different - typed objects , sun et al .",
    "@xcite proposed pathsim to measure the similarity of same - typed objects based on symmetric paths . however , many valuable paths are asymmetric and the relatedness of different - typed objects are also meaningful .",
    "pathsim is not suitable in these conditions . in information retrieval community ,",
    "lao and cohen @xcite proposed a path constrained random walk ( pcrw ) model to measure the entity proximity in a labeled directed graph constructed by the rich metadata of scientific literature .",
    "although the pcrw model can be applied to measuring the relatedness of different - typed objects , the asymmetric property of pcrw restricts its applications . in our hetesim definition",
    ", users can measure the relatedness of heterogeneous objects based on an arbitrary search path .",
    "the good merits of hetesim ( e.g. , symmetric and self - maximum ) make it suitable for more applications .",
    "a heterogeneous information network is a special type of information network , which either contains multiple types of objects or multiple types of links .",
    "* information network*. given a schema @xmath1 which consists of a set of entities types @xmath2 and a set of relations @xmath3 , an information network is defined as a directed graph @xmath4 with an object type mapping function @xmath5 and a link type mapping function @xmath6 .",
    "each object @xmath7 belongs to one particular object type @xmath8 , and each link @xmath9 belongs to a particular relation @xmath10 . when the types of objects @xmath11 or the types of relations @xmath12 , the network is called * heterogeneous information network * ; otherwise , it is a * homogeneous information network*.    in information networks , we distinguish object types and relation types . as a template for a network ,",
    "the network schema depicts the object types and the relations existing among object types . for a relation @xmath13 existing from type @xmath14 to type @xmath15 , denoted as @xmath16 , @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    "are the * source type * and * target type * of relation @xmath13 , which is denoted as @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the inverse relation @xmath19 holds naturally for @xmath20 .",
    "generally , @xmath21 is not equal to @xmath19 , unless @xmath21 is symmetric and these two types are the same .",
    "a bibliographic information network is a typical heterogeneous information network .",
    "the network schema of acm dataset ( see section v.a ) is shown in fig.[hin](a ) .",
    "it contains objects from seven types of entities : papers ( p ) , authors ( a ) , affiliations ( f ) , terms ( t ) , subjects ( s ) , venues ( v ) , and conferences ( c ) ( a conference includes multiple venues , e.g. , kdd including kdd2010 , kdd2009 and so on ) .",
    "there are links connecting different - typed objects .",
    "the link types are defined by the relations between two object types .",
    "for example , links exist between authors and papers denoting the writing or written - by relations , between venues and papers denoting the publishing or published - in relations .",
    "fig.[hin](b ) and ( c ) show the network schema of dblp dataset and imdb movie data ( see section v.a ) , respectively .",
    "different from homogeneous networks , two objects in a heterogeneous network can be connected via different paths and these paths have different meanings .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ hin](a ) , authors and conferences can be connected via ",
    "author - paper - venue - conference \" ( _ apvc _ ) path ,  author - paper - subject - paper - venue - conference \" ( _ apspvc _ ) path , and so on .",
    "the semantics underneath these two paths are different .",
    "the _ apvc _",
    "path means that papers written by authors are published in conferences , while the _ apspvc _ path means that papers having the same subjects as the authors papers are published in conferences .",
    "obviously , the distinct semantics under different paths will lead to different results .",
    "the relatedness under _ apvc _ path emphasizes the conferences that authors participated , while the relatedness under _ apspvc _ path emphasizes on conferences publishing the papers that have the same subjects with authors papers .",
    "for example , most of christos faloutsos s papers are published in the kdd , vldb , and sigmod",
    ". however , the papers having the same subjects with his papers may be published in widespread conferences , such as icdm , sdm , and cikm .",
    "so the relatedness of objects depends on the search path in the heterogeneous networks .",
    "formally , we define the meta search path as the relevance path .",
    "* relevance path*. a relevance path @xmath22 is a path defined on a schema @xmath1 , and is denoted in the form of @xmath23 which defines a composite relation @xmath24 between type @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 denotes the composition operator on relations . the length of the path @xmath22 is the number of relations in @xmath22 , which is @xmath28 .    for simplicity",
    ", we can also use type names denoting the relevance path if there are no multiple relations between the same pair of types : @xmath29 .",
    "we say a concrete path @xmath30 between @xmath31 and @xmath32 in network @xmath33 is a * path instance * of the relevance path @xmath22 , if for each @xmath34 , @xmath35 and each link @xmath36 belongs to the relation @xmath37 in @xmath22 .",
    "it can be denoted as @xmath38 .",
    "a relevance path @xmath39 is the * reverse path * of @xmath22 , which defines an inverse relation of the one defined by @xmath22 .",
    "similarly , we define the * reverse path instance * of @xmath40 as the reverse path of @xmath41 in @xmath33 .",
    "further , a relevance path @xmath22 is a * symmetric path * , if the relation @xmath13 defined by it is symmetric ( i.e. , @xmath22 is equal to @xmath39 ) , such as @xmath42 and @xmath43 . two relevance paths @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    "are * concatenable * if and only if @xmath46 is equal to @xmath47 , and the concatenated path is written as @xmath48 , which equals to @xmath49 .",
    "a simple concatenable example is that @xmath50 and @xmath51 can be concatenated to the path @xmath52 .",
    "in many domains , similar objects are more likely to be related to some other similar objects .",
    "for example , similar researchers usually publish many similar papers ; similar customers purchase similar commodities . as a consequence ,",
    "two objects are similar if they are referenced by similar objects .",
    "this intuition is also fit for heterogeneous objects .",
    "for example , a researcher is more relevant to the conferences that the researcher has published papers in ; and a customer is more faithful to the brands that the customer usually purchased .",
    "although the similar idea has been applied in simrank @xcite , it is limited to homogeneous networks .",
    "when we apply the idea to heterogeneous networks , it faces the following challenges .",
    "( 1 ) the relatedness of heterogeneous objects is path - constrained .",
    "the relevance path not only captures the semantics information but also constrains the walk path .",
    "so we need to design a path - based similarity measure .",
    "( 2 ) a uniform and symmetric measure should be designed for arbitrary paths . for a given path ( symmetric or asymmetric )",
    ", the measure can evaluate the relatedness of heterogeneous object pair ( same or different types ) with one single score . in the following section",
    ", we will illustrate these challenges and their solutions in detail .",
    "different from homogeneous networks , the paths in heterogeneous networks have semantics , which makes the relatedness of object pair depend on the given relevance path .",
    "following the basic idea that similar objects are related to similar objects , we propose a path - based relevance measure : hetesim .",
    "* hetesim * : given a relevance path @xmath53 , the hetesim score between two objects @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) is : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the out - neighbors of @xmath54 based on relation @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is the in - neighbors of @xmath55 based on relation @xmath62 .    when @xmath54 does not have any out - neighbors ( i.e. , @xmath63 ) or @xmath55 does not have any in - neighbors ( i.e. , @xmath64 ) following the path , we have no way to infer any relatedness between @xmath54 and @xmath55 in this case , so we define their relevance value to be 0 . particularly , we consider objects with same type to have * self - relation * ( denoted as @xmath65 relation ) and each object only has self - relation with itself .",
    "it is obvious that an object is just similar to itself for @xmath65 relation .",
    "so its relevance measure can be defined as follows :    * hetesim based on self - relation * : hetesim between two same - typed objects @xmath54 and @xmath55 based on the self - relation @xmath65 is : @xmath66 where @xmath67 , if @xmath54 and @xmath55 are same , or else @xmath68 .",
    "equation ( 1 ) shows that the computation of @xmath69 needs to iterate over all pairs @xmath70 @xmath71 of @xmath72 along the path ( @xmath54 along the path and @xmath55 against path ) , and sum up the relatedness of these pairs .",
    "then , we normalize it by the total number of out - neighbors of @xmath54 and in - neighbors of @xmath55 . that is , the relatedness between @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the average relatedness between the out - neighbors of @xmath54 and the in - neighbors of @xmath55 .",
    "the process continues until @xmath54 and @xmath55 will meet along the path .",
    "similar to simrank @xcite , hetesim is also based on pair wise random walk , while it considers the path constraint . as we know , simrank measures how soon two random surfers are expected to meet at the same node @xcite .",
    "by contrast , @xmath69 measures how likely @xmath54 and @xmath55 will meet at the same node when @xmath54 follows along the path and @xmath55 goes against the path .",
    "however , the source object @xmath54 and the target object @xmath55 may not meet along a given path @xmath22 .",
    "for the similarity measure of same - typed objects , the relevance paths are usually even - length , even symmetric , so the source object and the target object will meet at the middle objects . however , for the relevance measure of different - typed objects , the relevance paths are usually odd - length . in this condition , the source and target objects will never meet at the same objects .",
    "taking the @xmath73 path as an example , authors along the path and conferences against the path will never meet in the same objects .",
    "so the original hetesim is not suitable for odd - length relevance paths . in order to solve this difficulty ,",
    "a basic idea is to transform odd - length paths into even - length paths , and thus the source and target objects are always able to meet at the same objects . as a consequence",
    ", an arbitrary path can be decomposed as two equal - length paths .",
    "when the length @xmath28 of a relevance path @xmath74 is even , the source objects ( along the path ) and the target objects ( against the path ) will meet in the * middle type * object @xmath75 on the * middle position * @xmath76 , so the relevance path @xmath22 can be divided into two equal - length path @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "that is , @xmath79 , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "when the path length @xmath28 is odd , the source objects and the target objects will meet at the relation @xmath82 .",
    "for example , based on the _ apspvc _ path , the source and target objects will meet at the @xmath83 relation after two steps . in order to let the source and target objects meet at same - typed objects",
    ", we can add a middle type object _",
    "e _ between the atomic relation @xmath82 and maintain the relation between @xmath84 and @xmath85 at the same time .",
    "then the new path becomes @xmath86 which length is @xmath87 , an even number . in the aforementioned example , the path becomes _ apsepvc _ , whose length is even now .",
    "the source objects and the target objects will meet in the * middle type * object @xmath88 on the * middle position * @xmath89 . as a consequence",
    ", the new relevance path @xmath90 can also be decomposed into two equal - length path @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "* decomposition of relevance path*. an arbitrary relevance path @xmath29 can be decomposed into two equal - path path @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( i.e. , @xmath79 ) , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "@xmath91 and @xmath92 are defined as above .    obviously , for a symmetric path @xmath79 , @xmath93 is equal to @xmath77 .",
    "for example , the relevance path @xmath94 can be decomposed as @xmath95 and @xmath96 . for the relevance path _ apspvc _",
    ", we can add a middle type object @xmath97 in @xmath83 and thus the path becomes _ apsepvc _ , so @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the next question is how we can add the middle type object _",
    "e _ in an atomic relation _ r _ between @xmath84 and @xmath85 in an odd - length path . in order to contain original atomic relation ,",
    "we need to make the _ r _ relation be the composition of two new relations .",
    "to do so , for each instance of relation _",
    "r _ , we can add an instance of _ e _ to connect the source and target objects of the relation instance .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ decomexam](a ) , where the middle type object _",
    "e _ is added in between the atomic relation _",
    "ab _ along each path instance .",
    "* decomposition of atomic relation*. for an atomic relation @xmath13 , we can add an object type e ( called edge object ) between the @xmath17 and @xmath18 . and",
    "thus the atomic relation @xmath13 is decomposed as @xmath100 and @xmath101 where @xmath100 represents the relation between @xmath17 and @xmath97 and @xmath101 represents that between @xmath97 and @xmath18 . for each relation instance",
    "@xmath102 , an instance @xmath103 connects @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the paths @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the instances of @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "it is clear that the decomposition has the following property , whose proof can be found in the appendix a.    * property 1 . *",
    "an atomic relation @xmath13 can be decomposed as @xmath100 and @xmath101 , @xmath108 , and this decomposition is unique .",
    "based on this decomposition , the relatedness of two objects with an atomic relation @xmath13 can be calculated as follows :    * hetesim based on atomic relation * : hetesim between two different - typed objects @xmath54 and @xmath55 based on an atomic relation @xmath13 ( @xmath109 and @xmath110 ) is : @xmath111    it is easy to find that @xmath112 is a special case of @xmath113 , since , for the self - relation @xmath65 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 . definition 7 means that hetesim can measure the relatedness of two different - typed objects with an atomic relation @xmath13 directly through calculating the average of their mutual influence .",
    "[ decomexam](a ) shows an example of decomposition of atomic relation .",
    "the relation @xmath116 is decomposed into the relations @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "moreover , the relation @xmath116 is the composition of @xmath117 and @xmath118 as shown in fig .",
    "[ decomexam](b ) .",
    "two hetesim examples are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ decomexam](c ) . we can find that hetesim justly reflects relatedness of objects .",
    "taking @xmath119 for example , although @xmath119 equally connects with @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 , it is more close to @xmath121 , because @xmath121 only connects with @xmath119 .",
    "this information is correctly reflected in the hetesim score of @xmath119 based on @xmath116 path : @xmath123 .",
    "we also find that the similarity of an object and itself is not 1 in hetesim .",
    "taking the right figure of fig .",
    "[ decomexam](c ) as example , the relatedness of @xmath119 and itself is 0.33 .",
    "it is obviously unreasonable . in the following section",
    ", we will normalize the hetesim and make the relevance measure more reasonable .",
    "firstly , we introduce the calculation of hetesim between any two objects given an arbitrary relevance path .    * transition probability matrix*. for relation @xmath124 , @xmath125 is an adjacent matrix between type @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",

    "@xmath137 represents the probability of object @xmath138 reaching object @xmath139 under the path @xmath22 .",
    "according to the definition and property 2 of hetesim , the relevance between objects in @xmath25 and @xmath26 based on the relevance path @xmath140 is + @xmath141    the above equation shows that the relevance of @xmath25 and @xmath26 based on the path @xmath22 is the inner product of two probability distributions that @xmath25 reaches the middle type object @xmath91 along the path and @xmath26 reaches @xmath91 against the path . for two instances @xmath142 and @xmath143 in @xmath25 and @xmath26 ,",

    "it is reasonable that the relatedness of the same objects is 1 , so the hetesim can be normalized as follows :    * normalization of hetesim*. the normalized hetesim between two objects @xmath142 and @xmath143 based on the relevance path @xmath22 is : @xmath147    in fact , the normalized hetesim is the cosine of the probability distributions of the source object @xmath142 and target object @xmath143 reaching the middle type object @xmath91 .",
    "it ranges from 0 to 1 .",
    "[ decomexam](d ) shows the normalized hetesim scores .",
    "it is clear that the normalized hetesim is more reasonable .",
    "the normalization is an important step for hetesim with the following advantages .",
    "( 1 ) the normalized hetesim has nice properties .",
    "the following property 4 shows that hetesim satisfies the identity of indiscernibles .",
    "( 2 ) it has nice interpretation .",
    "the normalized hetesim is the cosine of two vectors representing reachable probability . as fouss et al",
    ". pointed out @xcite , the angle between the node vectors is a much more predictive measure than the distance between the nodes . in the following section",
    ", the hetesim means the normalized hetesim .",
    "hetesim has good properties , which makes it useful in many applications .",
    "the proof of these properties can be found in the appendix a.    * property 3 * : * symmetric * : @xmath148 .",
    "property 3 shows the symmetric property of hetesim .",
    "although pathsim @xcite also has the similar symmetric property , it holds only when the path is symmetric and @xmath142 and @xmath143 are with the same type .",
    "the hetesim has the more general symmetric property not only for symmetric paths ( note that @xmath22 is equal to @xmath39 for symmetric paths ) but also for asymmetric paths .    * property 4*. * self - maximum * : @xmath149 $ ] .",
    "@xmath150 is equal to 1 if and only if @xmath151 is equal to @xmath152 .",
    "property 4 shows hetesim is well constrained . for a symmetric path @xmath22 ( i.e. , @xmath153 ) , @xmath151 is equal to @xmath154 , and thus @xmath155 is equal to 1 .",
    "if we define the distance between two objects ( i.e. , @xmath156 ) as @xmath157 , the distance of the same object is zero ( i.e. , @xmath158 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "hetesim satisfies the identity of indiscernibles .",
    "note that it is a general identity of indiscernibles . for two objects with different types ,",
    "their hetesim score is also 1 if they have the same probability distribution on the middle type object .",
    "it is reasonable , since they have the similar structure based on the given path .",
    "since hetesim obeys the properties of non - negativity , identity of indiscernibles , and symmetry , we can say that hetesim is a semi - metric measure @xcite .",
    "because of a path - based measure , hetesim does not obey the triangle inequality .",
    "a semi - metric measure has many good merits and can be widely used in many applications @xcite .    *",
    "property 5*. * connection to simrank*. for a bipartite graph @xmath4 based on the schema @xmath159 , suppose the constant _ c _ in simrank is 1 , + @xmath160 , + @xmath161 .",
    "+ where @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath16 . here",
    "hetesim is the non - normalized version .",
    "this property reveals the connection of simrank and hetesim .",
    "simrank sums up the meeting probability of two objects after all possible steps .",
    "hetesim just calculates the meeting probability along the given relevance path . if the relevance paths explore all possible meta paths among the two objects , the sum of hetesim based on these paths is the simrank .",
    "so we can say that hetesim is a path - constrained version of simrank . through relevance paths",
    ", hetesim can subtly evaluate the similarity of heterogeneous objects with fine granularity .",
    "this property also implies that hetesim is more efficient than simrank , since hetesim only needs to calculate the meeting probability along the given relevance path , not all possible meta paths .",
    "let us analyze the time and space complexity of computing hetesim .",
    "suppose the average size of one type of objects is @xmath164 and there are @xmath165 types objects , the space requirement of hetesim is just @xmath166 to store the relatedness matrix .",
    "let @xmath167 be the average of @xmath168 over all object - pairs @xmath72 based on relation @xmath37 and @xmath169 .",
    "for a given @xmath28-length relevance path , the time required is @xmath170 , since node pairs ( i.e. , @xmath171 ) calculate their relatedness along the relevance path . for simrank ,",
    "the similarity of node pairs in all types ( i.e. , @xmath172 ) are iteratively calculated at the same time , so its space complexity is @xmath173 , and the time complexity is @xmath174 ( i.e. , @xmath175 ) , where @xmath0 is the number of iterations .",
    "so the complexity of computing hetesim is much smaller than simrank .    here",
    ", we discuss how to choose relevance path .",
    "there are several ways to do it .",
    "( 1 ) users can select proper paths according to their domain knowledge and experiences .",
    "( 2 ) supervised learning can be used to automatically determine the importance of relevance paths . in information retrieval field",
    ", lao and cohen @xcite proposed a learnable proximity measure where proximity is defined by a weighted combination of simple `` path experts '' . through",
    "labeled training data , a learning algorithm can infer the weights of paths .",
    "the similar strategy can also be used for path selection .",
    "( 3 ) recently , sun et al . @xcite",
    "combined meta path selection and user - guided information for clustering in heterogeneous networks .",
    "the similar user - guided information can also been applied in the selection of relevance paths in hetesim .",
    "there are numbers of similarity measures , most of which are based on three basic strategies @xcite : ( 1 ) path count strategy measures the number of path instances connecting source and target objects ; ( 2 ) random walk ( rw ) strategy measures the probability of the random walk from source to target objects ; and ( 3 ) pairwise random walk ( prw ) strategy measures the pairwise random walk probability starting from source and target objects and reaching the same middle objects . due to symmetry and arbitrary path constraints , we employ the prw model in this work . although the rw model can also satisfy the symmetric property through the combination of the reachable probability based on the paths @xmath22 and @xmath39 , it is redundancy for symmetric path , as well as short of nice interpretability . for the prw model ,",
    "it is inevitable to face the problem that the source and target object will not meet when the length of relevance path is odd . in order to solve it ,",
    "some optional strategies can be applied , such as assigning the meeting object type .",
    "this paper adopts the path deposition strategy based on the following advantages .",
    "( 1 ) it has a uniform framework to evaluate the relevance of same or different - typed objects for arbitrary paths .",
    "( 2 ) it provides a simple but effective method to evaluate the relevance of two different - typed objects based on an atomic relation ( see def .",
    "furtherly , we compare six well - established similarity measures in table [ tab : com ] .",
    "there are three similarity measures for heterogeneous networks ( i.e. , hetesim , pathsim , and pcwr ) and three measures for homogeneous networks ( i.e. , p - pagerank , simrank , and rolesim ) , respectively .",
    "although these similarity measures all evaluate the similarity of nodes by utilizing network structure , they have different properties and features .",
    "three measures for heterogeneous networks all are path - based , since meta paths in heterogeneous networks embody semantics and simplify network structure .",
    "two rw model based measures ( i.e. , p - pagerank and pcrw ) do not satisfy the symmetric property . because of satisfying the triangle inequation , rolesim is a metric , while hetesim , pathsim , and simrank are semi - metric .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we know that different paths have different semantic meanings in heterogeneous networks .",
    "table [ tab : pathsema ] shows such a case , which searches the most related authors to kdd conference based on two different relevance paths .",
    "the _ cvpa _",
    "path means conferences publishing papers written by authors .",
    "it identifies the most active authors to the conference .",
    "the _ cvpapa _",
    "path means conferences publishing papers written by authors co - authors .",
    "it identities the persons with the most active group of co - authors . in social network setting , this is like identifying the persons with the most active group of friends or potential targets for viral marketing . at first glance ,",
    "there are no obvious difference between the results returned by these two paths . however , the different ranks of these authors reveal the subtle semantics on the paths .",
    "the _ cvpa _",
    "path returns authors that have high publication records in kdd .",
    "for example , christos faloutsos published the most papers ( 32 ) in kdd .",
    "note that hetesim does not simply count the number of paths connecting two objects .",
    "it also considers the mutual influence of two objects . for example",
    ", jiawei han and philip yu published the second and third highest number of papers in kdd .",
    "however , they have wider research interests and published many papers in many other conferences , so their relatedness to kdd decrease based on the _ cvpa _ path .",
    "by contrast , the _ cvpapa _ path emphasizes on the publication records of the co - authors .",
    "the results also reflect this point .",
    "for example , although charu c. aggarwal published 13 papers in kdd , not the highest publication records , he has many co - authors which include many high - publication - record authors ( e.g. , philip yu and jiawei han ) , so he is the first author related to kdd based on _ cvpapa _ path .",
    "the same thing also happens to other authors .",
    "taking bianca zadrozny for example , she only published 6 papers in kdd .",
    "however , her co - authors also include many high - publicaton - record authors , such as philip yu , naoki abe , and wei fan . in all",
    ", hetesim can accurately capture the semantics under relevance paths ."
