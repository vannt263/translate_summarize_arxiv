    "only within the last two decades has it been realised that the interplay between vigorous star formation and the state of the interstellar medium ( ism ) can have profound implications for the evolution of galaxies and their environments ( see for example norman & ikeuchi 1989 ) .",
    "starbursts , and in particular the galactic mass outflows or winds driven by thermalised stellar winds from massive stars and supernovae , have implications for systems of all sizes .",
    "galactic winds may be responsible for the destruction of dwarf galaxies ( dekel & silk 1986 ; heckman 1995 ) , enrichment of the icm and igm in clusters and groups and removal of gas from merger remnants .",
    "heckman ( 1993 ) provide a comprehensive review of the observational data and theory of galactic winds .",
    "briefly , thermalised kinetic energy from stellar winds and supernovae from massive stars in the starburst creates a hot ( @xmath7 ) bubble in the ism .",
    "this expands , sweeping up ambient material into a dense shell .",
    "eventually the bubble breaks out of the disk of the galaxy along the minor axis .",
    "the hot wind then escapes freely at several thousand kilometers per second .",
    "the dense shell fragments due to rayleigh - taylor instabilities , and is carried along by the wind at velocities of order hundreds of kilometers per second .",
    "this or ambient clouds overrun by the wind is the source of optical emission line filaments , and possibly the soft emission .",
    "the archetypal starburst m82 presents possibly the best test case , given its proximity ( 3.63 , freedman 1994 ) and the wealth of observational data available .",
    "its high infrared luminosity ( @xmath8 , rieke 1993 ) , disturbed morphology , population of supernova remnants ( muxlow 1994 ) and luminous young super star clusters ( oconnell 1995 ) are all signatures of a strong burst of star formation .",
    "the starburst was probably caused by a close interaction with m82 s nearby ( projected distance @xmath9 ) neighbour m81 about @xmath10 ago ( cottrell 1977 ) , and a tidal bridge of connects the two galaxies ( yun 1993 ) .",
    "a set of emission line filaments along m82 s minor axis show velocities consistent with gas motions along the surface of a cone at @xmath11 ( axon & taylor 1978 ) : cooler material swept out of the galaxy by the much hotter wind .",
    "the @xmath12 emission defines an outflow that has a radius @xmath13 at a distance of @xmath14 above the galactic plane ( gtz 1990 ) , and is approximately cylindrical for @xmath15 . at larger",
    "@xmath16 the blowout flares out to a cone with an opening angle @xmath17 ( see fig .  5 in mckeith 1995 ) . within @xmath18 of the nucleus",
    "the inferred electron density in the filaments decreases with increasing @xmath16 .",
    "mckeith ( 1995 ) claim this is consistent with a @xmath19 model , as would be expected if the @xmath12 filaments were in pressure equilibrium with freely expanding wind such as that proposed by chevalier & clegg ( 1985 ) .",
    "a similar density decrease was also inferred by mccarthy ( 1987 ) .",
    "additional evidence for a galactic wind is the synchrotron emitting radio halo , extended preferentially along the minor axis ( seaquist & odegard 1991 ) , due to relativistic electrons from supernovae swept out from the starburst region by the wind .",
    "this has a maximum extent comparable to the emission ( this paper ) .",
    "a steepening of the spectral index interpreted as arising from energy loss by inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of the electrons off ir photons , allows an estimate of the speed with which the electrons are being convected outwards , assuming re - acceleration in shocks to be negligible .",
    "seaquist and odegard ( 1991 ) claim a conservative estimate of the wind velocity , allowing for the uncertainties , lies in the range 1000 - 3000 @xmath20 , similar to that predicted from theory ( chevalier & clegg 1985 ; heckman 1993 ) .",
    "schaaf s ( 1989 ) suggestion that produced by this ic scattering could be the source of the observed emission is argued against by seaquist ( 1991 ) who predict @xmath21 , in contrast with the value we derive below of @xmath22 in the _ rosat _ band .",
    "observations should provide a direct method of testing the galactic wind paradigm , given that thermalised stellar wind and supernovae ejecta is expected to have a temperature of @xmath7 .",
    "previous x - ray observations of m82 have suffered from poor sensitivity , poor spectral resolution and to a lesser extent poor spatial resolution .",
    "watson ( 1984 ) detected several very luminous ( @xmath23 ) sources along with diffuse emission using the _ einstein _ hri .",
    "the diffuse emission was seen to extend out to @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) to the south - east and @xmath26 to the north - west .",
    "spectral fits using the _ einstein _ ipc and mpc were inconclusive in that they were unable to distinguish between a power law or a thermal origin for the emission . given that they were unable to separate the point sources and the diffuse emission , this is not surprising .",
    "a reanalysis of the _ einstein _ data by fabbiano ( 1988 ) did attempt to separate the different components .",
    "the mpc ( without any imaging capability ) fitted temperature of @xmath27 would be dominated by the nuclear source and hence is not an estimate of the wind temperature .",
    "the ipc gives @xmath28 for the emission within @xmath29 of the nucleus , compared to @xmath30 for the emission between 200 - 300@xmath31 .",
    "the radial surface brightness in the ipc falls off approximately as @xmath32 , consistent with the expectation for a free wind .",
    "schaaf ( 1989 ) use an _ exosat _ observation together with the _ einstein _ data .",
    "the _ exosat _",
    "spectrum is consistent with either a power law or a raymond & smith plasma with temperature @xmath33 , again without any separation of point source and diffuse components .    although the extent of the emission seen within the _ exosat _ and _ einstein _ observations compares well with the higher sensitivity observation of _ rosat _ ( fig .",
    "1 ) , tsuru ( 1990 ) from observations with ginga , claim evidence for a very extended , @xmath34 halo .",
    "two north - south scans of a @xmath35 region centred on m82 show excess flux to the north of m82 , but not to the south .",
    "a spectral fit to this emission is essentially unconstrained , with a temperature in the range 1 - 11 .",
    "tsuru argue that a single point source could not produce the observed feature , as the position of the extra source is inconsistent between the two scans .",
    "they concede this could be due to two or more point sources , but estimate the chance of finding two sources of suitable flux in such a small region as 4 square degrees is @xmath36% .",
    "the dynamical age of such a halo is @xmath37 , hence this might be the remains of a wind from a starburst @xmath37 ago .",
    "the _ rosat _ hri observations of m82 ( bregman 1995 ) show three sources within the nuclear region of m82 , although two of them have very low s / n values above the strong and spatially varying wind emission . a very bright source present in",
    "the _ einstein _ data appears to have faded away completely ( collura 1994 ) , although the main nuclear source is at a position consistent with the _ einstein _ observation .",
    "bregman ( 1995 ) analyse the diffuse emission without the benefit of any spectral information .",
    "they conclude that the extended emission along the minor axis is consistent with an outflow of gas with opening angle that decreases with increasing radius within @xmath38 of the nucleus and at constant opening angle at larger radii .",
    "they model the emission successfully by adiabatically expanding gas of constant mass flux , and predict a decrease in temperature of the gas with increasing radius .",
    "[ fig : wind - grey ]    we report below , an analysis of the _ rosat _ pspc and hri observations of this emission .",
    "the pspc s mixture of good spatial and spectral capabilities compared to any other instrument , allow the best determination yet of the properties of this emission .",
    "in particular , we can separate point source and diffuse emission , and investigate the variation of spectral properties as a function of distance from the nucleus . for the first time , we show that the diffuse emission is thermal in origin , and obtain temperatures , emission measures , metallicities , and , for an assumed geometry , electron densities , gas masses and total energies .",
    "we compare our results with chevalier & clegg s ( 1985 ) analytical model of a galactic wind , and a simple model in which the emission comes from shock heated clouds rather than the wind itself .",
    "our results allow us to reject the possibility that the emission comes from the wind itself , and show that it could be consistent with emission from shock heated clouds .",
    "m82 was observed three times early in the _ rosat _ mission ( trmper 1984 ) by both the pspc and the hri ( table  [ tab : rosobs ] ) . only the pspc and the longer of the two hri observations",
    "are used in the present analysis .",
    "the use of the hri s good spatial resolution ( @xmath39 fwhm ) to complement the spectral information available at moderate resolution ( @xmath40 at 1 ) from the pspc , is advantageous , especially with regard to clarifying source confusion .",

    "a model of the background was constructed using data from an annulus @xmath44 , centred on m82 , with contaminating point sources removed . the particle contribution to the background",
    "was estimated using the master veto rate ( snowden 1992 ) and the remainder was corrected for energy - dependent vignetting , to give a spatial - spectral model of the background covering the entire field .",
    "this model was then adjusted ( by 3% ) as a result of an iterative process of further source searching using the pss programme ( allan 1995 ) , removal of sources from the background annulus , and rescaling of the background to achieve a drop to zero surface brightness away from m82 .",
    "the resulting background subtraction should be accurate to 2% .",
    "the hri s resolution and relative insensitivity to diffuse emission , make it an ideal instrument for investigating point sources in the field , clarifying the pspc analysis .",
    "the data were binned into an image of size @xmath45 centred on the @xmath42 nucleus , with a @xmath46 pixel size to exploit the hri s superior spatial resolution . given the flatness of the hri vignetting function within the region of interest , no vignetting correction was applied .",

    "this affects both the pspc and the hri .",
    "failure to incorporate this additional background leads to the detection of large number of low significance sources within the diffuse emission , whilst simply increasing the threshold significance leads to the non - detection of what are clearly real sources in regions free of diffuse emission .    as a result of this",
    "we employ an iterative procedure which starts by using a smoothed image ( including all sources and diffuse emission ) as the background for the source searching procedure .",
    "sources detected at @xmath140 are then excised from the image , out to the @xmath141 enclosed energy radius ( @xmath142 in the hri , @xmath143 in the pspc ) , and the resulting holes interpolated over .",
    "this dataset is then smoothed to provide a second approximation to the background .",
    "the 80% radius , to which sources are removed , is a compromise between removing so large a radius that the interpolation is unreliable , and too small a radius , leaving significant source contamination in the background .",
    "the above procedure of source searching followed by background estimation , was repeated until there was no further change in the list of detected sources .",

    "the final combined sourcelist is shown in table  [ tab : pspc - srcs ] .",
    "individual exposure - corrected spectra centred on the positions given in table  [ tab : pspc - srcs ] were obtained for each pspc source from the data cube within a radius corresponding to a 95% enclosed energy fraction at an energy of @xmath146 ( an appropriate energy for qso s which form the majority of background sources ) .",

    "[ sec : hri - red ] the presence of strong diffuse emission complicates source searching , which may lead to the detection of spurious sources within the diffuse emission . only five sources were detected independently in both the pspc and the hri .",
    "we have searched for counterparts to these objects at other wavelengths in the simbad database .",
    "one ( source 8) is m82 s nuclear source , another ( source 13 ) a qso .",
    "the other three do not have any counterparts .",
    "for the remaining pspc sources not detected in the hri , we found @xmath148 upper limits for the hri flux due to any point source within a region defined by the pspc positional uncertainty .",
    "these , together with predicted hri count rates from the spectral fits to the pspc sources , are given in table  [ tab : hri_uplim ] .",
    "there is little difference between the predicted fluxes for the power law and models .",
    "for the sources detected in both pspc and hri , the observed hri count rates agree well with those predicted , except for the nucleus , which is discussed below . in most other cases the upper limits are greater than ( i.e. consistent with ) the predicted count rates .",
    "for the two possible sources within the northern wind , sources 3 & 6 , the predicted count rates are higher than the hri @xmath148 upper limits .",
    "this could mean that these are not true point sources , merely bright lumps in the wind .",
    "note , however , that source 6 appears to be significantly cooler than the temperature of the wind emission in region n7 , where it is centred .",
    "alternatively , the predicted count rate could be overestimating the flux , due to the addition of diffuse flux along with real source flux .",
    "variability is another possible explanation for the hri non - detection .      as the hri observations have shown ( collura 1994 ; bregman 1995 ) , the nucleus of m82 contains a very luminous , variable source , along with non - uniform diffuse emission .",
    "it is little surprise that the single component fits to the nuclear source in the pspc data ( source 8 in table  [ tab : pspc - srcs ] ) are of poor quality .",

    "the power law from table  [ tab : pspc - srcs ] has a reduced @xmath147 of 7 with 19 degrees of freedom .",
    "an additional problem is the finite radius of @xmath150 within which the spectrum was extracted .",
    "although the 95% enclosed energy radius at @xmath146 is good for almost all sources , the brightness of the nucleus , coupled with its hardness , means that significant flux is scattered outside this radius . at energies above @xmath151",
    "this radius only encloses @xmath152 of the flux .",
    "given the large number of photons involved , this is likely to have a significant effect on any fit .",

    "the spectrum can also be fitted by a two component power law plus model , however the fit requires the power law to have a _ lower _ column than the hot plasma component .",

    "sec : discuss ] ) apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : wind - grey ] , it is not obvious what geometry to choose . within the wind paradigm , a conical ( suchkov 1994 ) to cylindrical outflow ( tomisaka & ikeuchi 1988 ; tomisaka & bregman 1993 ) along the galaxy s minor axis is expected , and if the emission arises from material a similar geometry would apply .    the azimuthal profile ( fig .  [ fig : azimuth ] ) of the pspc data about the centre of the galaxy can be used to explore the geometry of the diffuse emission .",
    "a biconical outflow would result in a sharp drop in the azimuthal brightness profile at the angles corresponding to the edges of the cone .",

    "the slopes for the re - analysis with a truncated conical geometry confirm this , the southern emission being less isentropic than for the cylindrical analysis .",
    "bearing in mind the geometry issue , we can attempt a more quantitative comparison between the observed temperatures and densities and the cc model , using the forms for @xmath422 and @xmath407 from cc , and the scaling relationships for the mass and energy injection given by heckman ( 1993 ) .",
    "these use the predicted deposition of mass , kinetic energy and momentum from a starburst calculated by leitherer ( 1992 ) . for a constant star formation rate over a period of @xmath434 , solar metallicity and a normal salpeter imf extending up to @xmath435 ,",
    "the various injection rates are related to the starburst bolometric luminosity by : @xmath436    where @xmath437 is the bolometric luminosity in units of @xmath438 . for most starbursts @xmath439 ,",
    "is the dominant contributor to @xmath440 so it is a reasonable approximation to equate @xmath437 with @xmath439 .",
    "how valid are these scaling relations for m82 ?",
    "visual inspection of leitherer s figures show that for all but the lowest metallicities the injection rates are approximately constant after @xmath441 , similar to the age of m82 s starburst ( rieke , 1993 ) .    applying the above scaling relations to chevalier & clegg s model we obtain , for radii large compared to the starburst radius @xmath442 : @xmath443    where @xmath300 is the electron number density number density , @xmath407 the temperature and @xmath425 the total solid angle through which the wind flows out .    note that the temperature is independent of @xmath440 , being a ratio of the energy and mass injection rates . for a bolometric luminosity of @xmath444 ( rieke 1993 ) and a characteristic radius , @xmath442 , for the starburst of @xmath445",
    ", we can predict @xmath422 and @xmath407 at radii corresponding to the regions in fig .",
    "[ fig : wind - reg ]  see table  [ tab : models ] . even for the innermost regions ( n1 and",
    "s1 ) the cc model underestimates the density by an order of magnitude .",
    "although the predicted temperature is almost equal to that observed near the galactic centre , the adiabatically expanding wind cools too quickly to match the pspc data , dropping to @xmath446 in the outermost regions , whereas the observed temperature along the minor axis is almost constant at @xmath447 and even rises in regions @xmath448 and @xmath449 to @xmath450 .    in summary",
    ", the densities and temperatures derived under our assumed cylindrical geometry differ greatly from those predicted under a spherical geometry by the cc model .",
    "given an arbitrary outflow geometry , it is in principle possible for the adiabatic wind model to reproduce the observed shallower trend in density , however the departure of the southern wind from constant entropy is a robust result which is incompatible with the basic assumptions of the cc model .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that the observed emission can not arise from a single phase , expanding wind .",
    "the fact that the entropy actually _ rises _ with @xmath16 in the south , means that the cc model can not be saved by supposing that additional material is entrained into the flow as it proceeds .",
    "although this might raise the density , it would cause the entropy to decline with @xmath16 , accentuating the disagreement with our results .",
    "it has been suggested ( w.  pietsch , private communication ) that the extended emission around ngc 253 may be due not to a wind or shocked cloud emission , but to a static halo .",
    "for m82 the optical emission line velocity data and spectral index variations in the radio halo ( mckeith 1995 ; seaquist & odegard 1991 ) demonstrate conclusively the presence of a galactic wind .",
    "since the synchrotron emission is very similar to the in extent , so it is difficult to argue that the emission is not associated with a wind .    can we rule out a hydrostatic halo on the basis of the observed properties ?",
    "from the observed density and temperature the mass within some radius @xmath400 for a hydrostatic halo , assuming spherical symmetry , is : @xmath451    where the observed temperature @xmath452 and density @xmath453 . for regions n3 and s3 the predicted mass within @xmath454 are @xmath455 and @xmath456 respectively . from gtz ( 1990 )",
    "the mass within this radius , based on velocities measured in , is @xmath457 , an order of magnitude lower .",
    "hence we can rule out any possibility that the x - ray emitting gas is bound to m82 as a static halo .",
    "an alternative to emission from a free wind is emission from shocked material embedded in such a wind .",
    "any clouds of denser material overrun by the wind , be they fragmented remnants of the dense shell swept up by the wind in its `` snow - plough '' phase or clouds in the ism , will be shock - heated . the @xmath12 filamentation seen along the minor axis has line ratios indicative of material shocked to @xmath458 .",
    "less dense material would be heated to even higher temperatures , and could be the source of the soft seen , rather than the emission being due to the wind itself .",
    "the temperature to which these clouds will be heated depends on the speed of the shock driven into them by the wind .",
    "this depends on the relative densities of the cloud and the wind , and the wind velocity . in the case of strong shocks ( mach number m",
    "@xmath459 1 ) we can ignore the thermal pressure of both the wind and the cloud , and equate momentum flux across the shock . given the mass and energy injection rates",
    ", one expects a wind velocity @xmath460 , whereas the sound speed in the emitting gas is @xmath461 .",
    "clouds will be accelerated by the wind to varying extents depending on their column density and individual histories , but only to velocities of order hundreds of @xmath20 , as seen in the @xmath12 filaments .",
    "hence the strong shock approximation is not unreasonable .",
    "the shock driven into the cloud will then have a velocity @xmath462 .",

    "so , in summary , predicted postshock temperatures for a simple model where the wind shock heats clouds are consistent with , if slightly lower than , those observed , given the observed emission measure ( density ) .",
    "tomisaka & ikeuchi ( 1988 ) were the first to explicitly model the wind in m82 using 2d hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "they found a roughly cylindrical bipolar wind formed naturally for a constant mass and energy input rate in the nucleus of 0.1 sn @xmath479 .",
    "however , they modelled the ism as a cold rotationally supported disk in which the angular velocity was independent of the distance from the plane of the disk .",
    "this physically unrealistic configuration creates a strong funnel along the @xmath16- which strongly collimates the wind .",
    "tomisaka & bregman ( 1993 ) allowed the rotational velocity to decrease exponentially away from the cold disk , into a hot low density halo .",
    "this distribution still provides a strong cylindrical funnel for the expansion of the wind at low @xmath16 .",
    "suchkov ( 1994 , hereafter sbhl ) provide a more realistic ism for their modelling of m82 : a two component cold rotating dense disk and non - rotating hot tenuous halo , and a starburst history incorporating the milder mass and energy input from stellar winds before the more energetic supernovae dominated stages .",
    "they find bipolar outflows form easily over a wide range in different halo and disk conditions . shocked halo gas at temperatures @xmath480 provides the majority of the emission in their `` soft '' band ( @xmath481 ) .",
    "the eventual wind geometry depends on the initial gas distribution and the mass and energy input history . for those models with `` mild '' early winds ( models a1 and a2 in sbhl ) biconical outflows of opening angle @xmath482 with",
    "dense disk material entrained along the surface do occur naturally .",
    "initially the mild wind creates a cavity in the disk to the halo for the wind to escape , without substantially damaging the disk .",
    "the wind then propagates outward in the halo , sweeping it up and shocking it . in the later sn - driven stage of the starburst ,",
    "the more vigorous wind does manage to disrupt some of the disk , dragging it out to form a cone within a much larger bubble .",
    "this provides a natural explanation for the difference in distribution between the outflow cone seen in h@xmath68 and the more extended emission . without an early mild wind ( models b1 and b2 ) , the disk is disrupted before the wind has easy access to the halo , and so no obvious cone in the is visible . even when present , the conical wind does not provide appreciable soft flux compared to the shocked halo ( see figs .",
    "4 , 10 and 14 in sbhl ) , so we would not expect to see such structures in the _ rosat _ data . the radial extent of the soft emitting material is much greater than that of the cones , the emission appearing more like a figure - of - eight ( fig . 4 in sbhl ) or a cylinder ( fig . 10 in sbhl ) .",
    "none of the models sbhl present would be seen as more conical than cylindrical when projected along the line of sight and observed by a real instrument . as sbhl",
    "did not provide projected surface brightness plots , it is difficult to assess how limb - brightened the emission would be , but given the brightness of the shocked halo material it should be a detectable effect .",
    "the luminosity varies greatly between the different models , and is not simply proportional to the mass and energy input in the starburst .",
    "model a1 has a time averaged mass and energy input an order of magnitude less than model b1 , but has a soft ( @xmath481 ) luminosity of @xmath483 at @xmath484 myr ( when the starburst luminosity is @xmath485 , very close to m82 s bolometric luminosity ) , well above the @xmath486 wind luminosity of @xmath487 derived above for m82 .",
    "model b1 has a corresponding luminosity of only @xmath488 , despite having a similar initial gas distribution to model a1 .",
    "given the wide range of predicted wind luminosity it would require a deeper investigation of the available parameter space to use m82 s luminosity to constrain the allowable models .",
    "sbhl provide `` effective '' temperatures for the gas in their `` soft '' band which corresponds well to the _ rosat _ band , by comparing fluxes in two energy bands of @xmath489 and @xmath490 , as well as the temperature range for the gas that provides the majority of the soft emission . in all cases",
    "the emission is very soft , typically @xmath491 .",
    "the hottest model ( b1 ) has a characteristic temperature of only @xmath492 .",
    "this is still cooler than m82 s wind , where the temperature varies between @xmath493 .",
    "sbhl stress the lack of appreciable amounts of gas hotter than @xmath494 .",
    "the wind itself is much hotter , but provides very little emission , @xmath495 .",
    "the lower temperatures predicted by sbhl do correspond with observations of some galaxies for which soft emission can be detected .",
    "ngc 891 has a halo with @xmath496 ( bregman & pildis , 1994 ) , and wang ( 1995 ) detect soft @xmath497 emission out to more than @xmath498 from the plane of ngc 4631 .",
    "a survey of _ rosat _ pspc observation of nearby normal and starburst galaxies by read ( 1996 ) shows that many starbursts have diffuse gas with temperatures @xmath499 , more in line with our results .",
    "the density of the gas responsible for the emission in sbhl s models is typically @xmath500 .",
    "this is not inconsistent with our results of @xmath501 .",
    "the filling factor of the emitting gas in their models we can roughly estimate as @xmath502 , which bring their densities close to ours .",
    "the gas mass providing the bulk of the soft emission depends strongly on the model used , but model b1 which has a soft luminosity similar to that observed for m82 s wind has a gas mass of @xmath503 , comparable with the total mass derived from the pspc of @xmath504 for reasonable values of the filling factor .",
    "we have provided a detailed spectral investigation of the extended soft emission associated with the starburst galaxy m82 .",
    "point sources have been located and removed from the diffuse wind emission , and the effects of contamination by the nuclear source allowed for .",
    "the diffuse emission was divided into a set of distinct regions as a function of distance from the galactic plane , allowing temperature , emission measure and absorbing column to be derived as a function of distance along the minor axis .",
    "the metallicity was found to be apparently low ( 0.00@xmath201 ) throughout the wind , in agreement with results from asca .",
    "this work has shown the following :    * the observed soft morphology differs significantly between north and south , and is not well described as a conical outflow .",
    "the emission extends out to @xmath0 from the plane of the galaxy .",
    "there is no evidence for any limb brightening , as would be expected if the soft emission came from the shock heated halo surrounding the hot wind . *",
    "the emission from the wind is thermal .",
    "the temperature drops slowly along the wind , from @xmath2 near the nucleus , to @xmath3 in the outer wind .",
    "numerical models of galactic winds predict the majority of the emission in the _ rosat _ band to be shocked halo , with effective temperatures in the range @xmath480 . *",
    "since the entropy of the gas is not constant , at least in the south , the observed emission can not originate from a free wind itself .",
    "our baseline analysis is based on an assumed cylindrical geometry , but a more divergent geometry only makes the southern wind less isentropic . * the emission can not come from a static halo of gas around m82 , given that the mass required to bind a hydrostatic halo is an order of magnitude higher than that inferred from the rotational velocity in the outer disk . * for reasonable mass and energy input from the starburst ,",
    "a simple model for emission from shock heated clouds using the observed density of the emitting gas to predict post - shock temperatures is consistent with the observed temperatures .",
