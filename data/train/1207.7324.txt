    "in lattice qcd , the finite lattice spacing and finite lattice volume effects on the gluon propagator can be investigated with the help of lattice simulations at several lattice spacings and physical volumes . here",
    "we report on such a calculation . for details on the lattice setup",
    "see @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : gluevol ] , we show the renormalized gluon propagator at @xmath0 gev for all lattice simulations . note that we compare our data with the large volume simulations performed by the berlin - moscow - adelaide collaboration @xcite ",
    "see @xcite for details . in each plot",
    "we show data for a given value of @xmath1 , i.e. data in the same plot has the same lattice spacing .",
    "the plots show that , for a given lattice spacing , the infrared gluon propagator decreases as the lattice volume increases . for larger momenta ,",
    "the lattice data is less dependent on the lattice volume ; indeed , for momenta above @xmath2900 mev the lattice data define a unique curve .",
    "we can also investigate finite volume effects by comparing the renormalized gluon propagator computed using the same physical volume but different @xmath1 values .",
    "we are able to consider 4 different sets with similar physical volumes  see figure [ fig : gluespac ] .",
    "although the physical volumes considered do not match perfectly , one can see in figure [ fig : gluespac ] that for momenta above @xmath2 900 mev the lattice data define a unique curve .",
    "this means that the renormalization procedure has been able to remove all dependence on the ultraviolet cut - off @xmath3 for the mid and high momentum regions .",
    "however , a comparison between figures [ fig : gluevol ] and [ fig : gluespac ] shows that , in the infrared region , the corrections due to the finite lattice spacing seem to be larger than the corrections associated with the finite lattice volume .",
    "in particular , figure [ fig : gluespac ] shows that the simulations performed with @xmath4 , i.e. , with a coarse lattice spacing , underestimate the gluon propagator in the infrared region . in this sense , the large volume simulations performed by the berlin - moscow - adelaide collaboration provide a lower bound for the continuum infrared propagator .",
    "we also aim to study how temperature changes the gluon propagator . at finite temperature ,",
    "the gluon propagator is described by two tensor structures ,    @xmath5    where the transverse and longitudinal projectors are defined by @xmath6 the transverse @xmath7 and longitudinal @xmath8 propagators are given by @xmath9    @xmath10    on the lattice , finite temperature is introduced by reducing the temporal extent of the lattice , i.e. we work with lattices @xmath11 , with @xmath12 . the temperature is defined by @xmath13 .    in table",
    "[ tempsetup ] we show the lattice setup of our simulation .",
    "simulations in this section have been performed with the help of chroma library @xcite . for the determination of the lattice spacing we fit the string tension data in @xcite in order to have a function @xmath14 .",
    "note also that we have been careful in the choice of the parameters , in particular we have only two different spatial physical volumes : @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this allows for a better control of finite size effects .",
    ".lattice setup used for the computation of the gluon propagator at finite temperature .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tempsetup ]    figures [ fig : transtemp ] and [ fig : longtemp ] show the results obtained up to date .",
    "we see that the transverse propagator , in the infrared region , decreases with the temperature .",
    "moreover , this component shows finite volume effects ; in particular , the large volume data exhibits a turnover in the infrared , not seen at the small volume data .",
    "the longitudinal component increases for temperatures below @xmath17 .",
    "then the data exhibits a discontinuity around @xmath18 , and the propagator decreases for @xmath19 .",
    "the behaviour of the gluon propagator as a function of the temperature can also be seen in the 3d plots shown in figure [ fig:3dtemp ] .    as shown above",
    ", data for different physical ( spatial ) volumes exhibits finite volume effects .",
    "this can be seen in more detail in figure [ fig : finvoltemp ] , where we show the propagators for two volumes at t=324 mev .",
    "moreover , we are also able to check for finite lattice spacing effects at t=305 mev , where we worked out two different simulations with similar physical volumes and temperatures , but different lattice spacings . for this case",
    ", it seems that finite lattice spacing effects are under control , with the exception of the zero momentum for the transverse component ",
    "see figure [ fig : lattspactemp ] .",
    "our results show that a better understanding of lattice effects is needed before our ultimate goal , which is the modelling of the propagators as a function of momentum and temperature .",
