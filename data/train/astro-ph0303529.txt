    "the formation of elliptical galaxies by merging disk galaxies has been studied in numerous simulations since it was proposed by @xcite ( see @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "this merging hypothesis has proven very successful in explaining many of the properties of ellipticals .",
    "even though there are still questions which need further investigation , like the origin of peculiar core properties of ellipticals , it is now widely believed that ellipticals formed by mergers of disk galaxies . in the framework of hierarchical structure formation",
    ", merging is the natural way in which structure grows .",
    "indeed , the observed merger fraction of galaxies is in agreement with the predictions of hierarchical models of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "semi - analytical models of galaxy formation , which successfully reproduce many observed properties of galaxies , generally assume that star formation takes place in a galactic disk which formed by gas infall into dark matter halos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "once these disk galaxies merge , depending on the mass ratio of the galaxies , elliptical galaxies form .",
    "n - body simulations suggest a mass ratio of @xmath4 , with @xmath5 to generate ellipticals @xcite .",
    "we refer to these events as major mergers and to events with @xmath6 as minor mergers .",
    "ellipticals can later on build up new disks by accretion of gas and become bulges of spiral galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or merge with other galaxies .",
    "up to now the frequency of elliptical - elliptical mergers ( dry mergers , e - e ) or spiral - elliptical mergers ( mixed mergers , sp - e ) has not been studied in detail despite observational evidence indicating their importance .",
    "@xcite , for example , find mergers of red , bulge dominated galaxies in a rich cluster at intermediate redshifts .    in this letter we investigate the liklihood of dry and mixed mergers .",
    "our semi - analytical model was constructed similar to those described in detail by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "merger trees of dark matter halos with different final masses @xmath7 at @xmath8 were generated using the method described by @xcite , which is based on the extended press - schechter formalism @xcite .",
    "the mass @xmath7 traces different environments .",
    "we adopt @xmath9 which represents a field environment and @xmath10 which is a galactic cluster environment .",
    "present day ellipticals are identified by their b - band bulge - to - disc ratio as in @xcite , which corresponds to roughly more than @xmath11 of the stellar mass in the bulge .",
    "we divide the progenitor morphologies into two distinct classes .",
    "those with dominant bulge component are labeled _ e _ and those with dominant disk component are labeled _",
    "sp_. in what follows our standard model assumes that the stars of accreted satellites in minor mergers contribute to the bulge component of the more massive progenitor and bulge dominated galaxies have more than @xmath12 of their stellar mass in the bulge .",
    "we adopt a @xmath13cdm cosmology with @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 .",
    "we start by analyzing the morphology of progenitors involved in major mergers adopting our standard model . due to continuous interactions ,",
    "the fraction of bulge dominated galaxies increases with decreasing redshift . as a result ,",
    "the probability for them to be involved in a major merging event increases too , which is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ pla ] for a field ( @xmath18 ) and cluster environment ( @xmath10 ) . due to more frequent interactions",
    "the increase of the e - e and sp - sp fraction is faster in more dense environments and at redshifts @xmath19 the sp - e and e - e fraction show clear environmental dependencies .",
    "the fraction of e - e mergers increases faster ( slower ) while the fraction of sp - e mergers increases slower ( faster ) with time in high density ( low ) regions .",
    "the most massive galaxies are mainly bulge dominated ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that the fraction of e - e and sp - e is mass dependent",
    ". the right panel of fig .",
    "[ pla ] illustrates the fraction of present day ellipticals at each magnitude which experienced last major mergers of type e - e , sp - sp or sp - e .",
    "the fraction of e - e and sp - e mergers indeed increases towards brighter luminosities with a tendency to increase faster in more dense environments , due to the higher fraction of bulge dominated galaxies .",
    "one can distinguish between three luminosity regions : for @xmath20 dry , at around @xmath1 , mixed and for @xmath21 sp - sp mergers dominate .",
    "it is important to understand how our results depend on the model assumptions .",
    "we focus on cluster environments with @xmath22 , where the fraction of ellipticals is largest , and investigate the dependence on our definition of a bulge dominated galaxy .",
    "we varied the definition of a bulge dominated galaxy from more than @xmath11 mass in the bulge component to more than @xmath23 mass in the bulge .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ plc ] . the tighter definition of a bulge dominated galaxy reduces ( increases ) the fraction of e - e ( sp - sp ) mergers at all redshifts , which results in a lower ( higher ) fraction of last major mergers being between bulge ( disk ) dominated galaxies",
    ". the right panel of fig .",
    "[ plc ] reveals in which mass range the galaxies are most sensitive to the definition of a bulge dominated galaxy . at the high mass end with @xmath0 ( e - e region )",
    "most of the e - progenitors have a very large fraction of their mass in their bulge component , while in the sp - e and sp - sp region the e - progenitors do not have such dominant bulge components , which explains why the sp - e fraction increases for @xmath24 if a tighter definition of bulge dominated galaxies is assumed .",
    "in our standard model we assumed the stars of a satellite in a minor merger to contribute to the bulge component of the more massive progenitor .",
    "however the fate of the satellite s stars is not that clear , as e.g. @xcite find that in mergers with @xmath25 the stars of the satellite get added in roughly equal parts to the disk and the bulge .",
    "we tested three different models assuming the stars of satellites in minor mergers to contribute to the bulge ( bulge model ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the disk ( disk model ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or half of the stars to the bulge and the other half to the disk ( disk - bulge model ) of the more massive progenitor .",
    "we find that the fraction of sp - e merger does not change significant while the fraction of sp - sp ( e - e ) mergers increases ( decreases ) from bulge to disk model ( fig .",
    "[ pld ] ) .",
    "this demonstrates that minor mergers play an important role between two major merging events of a galaxy .",
    "the stars and the gas contributed from the satellites will affect the morphology of elliptical galaxies and make them look more like lenticular galaxies .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the fraction of present day ellipticals brighter than a given magnitude which experienced last major mergers of e - e , sp - e or sp - sp type .",
    "if bulge dominated galaxies are defined as those with more than @xmath12 of their mass in the bulge .",
    "we find , independent of the fate of the satellite stars , that more than @xmath2 of the ellipticals brighter than @xmath26 have experienced a last major merger which was not a merger between disk dominated galaxies .",
    "we have analyzed the morphologies of progenitors of present day ellipticals based on their stellar mass content in bulge and disk , finding that in contrast to the common assumption of disk dominated progenitors , a large fraction of ellipticals were formed by the merging of a bulge dominated system with a disk galaxy or another bulge dominated system .",
    "@xcite find that the fraction of gas involved in the last major merger of present day ellipticals decreases with stellar mass .",
    "we find the same behavior and show in addition that the fraction of dry and mixed mergers increases with luminosity , suggesting that massive ellipticals mainly formed by nearly dissipationless mergers of ellipticals ( dry mergers ) .",
    "our results combined with those of @xcite provide an explanation for core properties of ellipticals as observed e.g. by @xcite .",
    "progenitors of massive ellipticals should be bulge dominated with massive black holes and very little gas .",
    "their merging leads naturally to flat cores in the remnant .",
    "in contrast , progenitors of low mass ellipticals are gas rich with small bulges and low mass black holes , resulting in dissipative mergers and cuspy remnants . with these assumptions it is possible to reproduce the relation between mass deficit and black hole mass observed by @xcite ( khochfar & burkert in preparation ) .",
    "it is also interesting to note that @xcite and @xcite find that ulirgs have effective radii and velocity dispersions similar to those of intermediate mass disky ellipticals with @xmath27 ( sp - e region ) .",
    "qsos on the other hand have effective radii and velocity dispersions which are similar to giant boxy ellipticals ( e - e region ) .",
    "this suggests that ulirgs should be formed in sp - e mergers whereas qsos formed almost dissipationless through e - e mergers .",
    "we find that many bulge dominated progenitors experienced minor mergers in between two major merger events .",
    "the morphology of these objects is somewhat ambiguous and may depend on several parameters like the impact parameter of the infalling satellites .",
    "however , it is clear that these galaxies will rather look like lenticular galaxies than classical spirals .",
    "if lenticulars make up a large fraction of progenitors of present day ellipticals with @xmath28 , numerical simulations of the formation of giant elliptical galaxies should start with progenitors which were disturbed by minor mergers and should not use relaxed spiral galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "independent of the fate of satellite stars in minor mergers , more than @xmath2 of present day ellipticals",
    "brighter than @xmath29 in clusters had a last major merger which was not a merger between two classical spiral galaxies .",
    "despite all the successes of simulations of merging spirals in explaining elliptical galaxies our results indicate that only low mass ellipticals are represented by such simulations .",
    "more simulations of sp - e ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and e - e mergers are required to address the question of the formation of ellipticals via merging adequately .",
