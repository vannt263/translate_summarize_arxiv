    "these are triangulated categories which should be seen as geometrical instances of homological invariants like ( numerical ) k - groups .",
    "a first hint at this is the fact that to any spherical sheaf @xmath8 one can associate a _",
    "spherical twist _",
    "@xmath280 which is an autoequivalence .",
    "it is defined by distinguished triangles @xmath281 for @xmath282 .",
    "see @xcite or @xcite for details . for a spherical sheaf @xmath8 with support in @xmath83 , the functor @xmath283 induces an autoequivalence of @xmath279 .    to any triangulated category one can associate its k - group . in the case of @xmath278 and @xmath279 , these are @xmath170 and @xmath178 , respectively .",
    "the triangulated category @xmath279 is 2-calabi - yau , i.e.  has the even shift @xmath284 $ ] as serre functor , and this explains why the euler form on @xmath178 is symmetric .",
    "( the serre functor of @xmath278 is @xmath285 $ ] and thus is in general not a shift . )",
    "any autoequivalence @xmath286 induces an automorphism @xmath287 of the k - group , which is an isometry for the euler pairing . in case @xmath288",
    "is a spherical twist , we have @xmath289 as @xmath28 is a surface .",
    "the defining triangles for @xmath283 show that @xmath290 is just the reflection along @xmath291\\in k(s)$ ] .",
    "this allows us to lift lattices and coxeter elements to the categorical level ( the third lines about @xmath292 and @xmath293 only apply in the case of negatively smoothable fuchsian singularities ) : @xmath294 at the top , @xmath295 .",
    "hence @xmath296 and @xmath297 are triangulated subcategories of @xmath278 .",
    "@xmath292 is , by definition , the smallest triangulated subcategory of @xmath298 containing @xmath299 and @xmath235 .",
    "turning to the k - groups , it is clear that @xmath300 and @xmath301^\\perp$ ] and @xmath302 $ ] .",
    "the numerical k - groups are all defined using the radical of the k - group of the surface . for example , @xmath303 is the image of the composition @xmath304 ; similar for the other lattices which are all equipped with the negative of the euler form .    as a side remark",
    ", we want to point out that the three categories can also be described by @xmath305 , @xmath306 , and @xmath307 , i.e.  they coincide with the smallest triangulated subcategories containing the basis sheaves .",
    "for this , one uses that @xmath83 consists of rigid projective lines . , we have @xmath308 as the cokernel of a morphism @xmath309 .",
    "this implies @xmath310 for all @xmath311 since @xmath83 is a tree of rational curves .",
    "hence , if @xmath312 is supported on one component of @xmath83 , then @xmath313 .",
    "note , that there are no non - trivial self - extensions with one - dimensional support as the irreducible components are rigid .",
    "finally , an arbitrary sheaf @xmath312 with support in @xmath83 can be split into pieces with support on different components . for this , use the cones of @xmath314 for the inclusion @xmath315 .",
    "then , @xmath316 immediately implies @xmath317 .",
    "the reasoning for the other categories proceeds along the same lines .",
    "it is worth mentioning that @xmath318 does not have finite generators  it is representation - wild ; see @xcite . ]",
    "each of the three triangulated categories is generated by spherical objects and the autoequivalences @xmath319 , @xmath320 and @xmath293 are given by a concatenation of spherical twist functors .",
    "their traces on the k - groups are precisely the coxeter elements we used before .",
    "they study the triangulated category @xmath321 of graded singularities of the algebra @xmath16 in the hypersurface case .",
    "it is defined as the quotient of the bounded derived category of finitely generated graded @xmath16-modules by the derived category of projective modules .",
    "well known other descriptions for @xmath321 use either graded maximal cohen - macaulay modules or , in the hypersurface case , matrix factorisations .    in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the authors prove , for special cases of @xmath16 , the existence of full , strongly exceptional sequences in @xmath321 .",
    "these yield root bases in the associated grothendieck groups ( with respect to the symmetrised euler form ) and a corresponding coxeter element .",
    "the latter lifts to an autoequivalence of @xmath321 given by the auslander - reiten translation functor .",
    "@xcite addresses regular weight systems with @xmath322 , which correspond precisely to the kleinian singularities ( using the notation from section [ kandf ] , one has @xmath323 ) .",
    "@xcite deals with certain regular weight systems with @xmath324 , which are the hypersurface singularities of fuchsian type with @xmath10 and either @xmath135 ( the 14 unimodal singularities ) or @xmath325 ( six bimodal singularities ) or @xmath326 ( two singularities )",
    ". however , the virtue of the approach presented here seems to be that the coxeter element lifts to an autoequivalence of the derived category of the ambient surfaces ; also , we do nt need to impose any restriction on the fuchsian singularities ( apart from negative smoothability for the categorical interpretation ) ."
