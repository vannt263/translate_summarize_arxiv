    "eprb experiments are performed at two space - like separated locations .",
    "the two particles of an entangled pair emanating from a source are spatially separated and propagate to the space - like separated locations .",
    "the properties of these particles are measured by instruments that are described by a  setting \" such as the direction of a polarizer or magnet which is characterized by a unit vector of three dimensional space denoted by @xmath0 .",
    "measurements of this type have been performed by a number of researchers and have had a checkered history with respect to the results .",
    "these , at first , contradicted and then confirmed quantum theory  @xcite .",
    "there are still significant deviations from quantum theory in current experiments , which are , however , mostly ignored  @xcite .",
    "we proceed here by just stipulating that indeed these experiments showed a violation of the , by now , famous bell inequality and describe in the following only bell s postulates and assumptions , thereby focusing on the simplest case involving only three settings and not four , as used in actual experiments , see also  @xcite .",
    "bell s postulates and assumptions are considered by many researchers to be entirely general and valid for all epr like experiments and gedanken - experiments as long as they can be described by classical physics such as einstein s relativity .",
    "bell s classical - physics model for the system of measurement equipment and entangled pairs of the eprb experiments is constructed as follows  @xcite .",
    "he assumed that all experimental results , all data , can be described by using functions @xmath1 that map the independent measurement results onto @xmath2 or the segment @xmath3 $ ] of the real axis .",
    "the variables in the argument of the function always include the settings @xmath4 and another variable , or set of variables , that bell denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "bell then proceeded to present a proof of his now celebrated inequality : @xmath6 where @xmath7 indicates the average over many measurements .",
    "the left and right factor of each term correspond to the data taken at the two corresponding space like separated measurement stations .",
    "the events of measurements and corresponding data are linked to clock times of two synchronized laboratory clocks .",
    "therefore , the functions @xmath1 as well as the variables @xmath8 and @xmath9 must for each of the products correspond to pairs of clock times @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the measurement number .",
    "note that bell s original paper assigned to @xmath5 only properties of the entangled pair .",
    "it is now generally assumed  @xcite that @xmath5 may stand for a set of arbitrary physical variables including space and time coordinates or even einstein s space - time @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , @xmath5 may also describe some properties of the measurement equipment ( in addition to the magnet or polarizer orientation @xmath13 ) , such as dynamical effects arising from many - body interactions of the entangled pair with the constituent particles and fields of the measurement equipment .",
    "bell agreed with this assumption in his later work @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to show that the postulate of counterfactual definiteness in conjunction with the use of a setting variable @xmath13 does not permit the introduction of general space and time related variables that describe the said many body dynamics . therefore , bell s assumptions are not general enough to describe classical theories of eprb experiments that include dynamic processes involving the measurement equipment .",
    "peres  @xcite gave the following definition of counterfactual realism , which roughly agrees with the definition of leggett @xcite .",
    "peres claims , as does leggett , not to use traditional concepts of mathematics and physics to start with , but only  what could have possibly been the results of unperformed experiments \" and bases his definition of counterfactual realism on the following statement :    we agree that it is possible , as a purely intellectual activity , to imagine hypothetical results for any unperformed tests .",
    "however , without significant additional assumptions , it is not possible  to do calculations where these unknown results are treated as if they were numbers \" .",
    "here we encounter the so often unrecognized gulf between sense impressions , even just imagined ones , and conceptual frame - works such as the axiomatic system of numbers or the probability theory of kolmogorov .",
    "peres , leggett and a majority of quantum information theorists did not and do not recognize that giant gulf , that giant separation , between events of nature , recorded as data , and the axiomatic edifices of human thought .",
    "if one wishes to treat hypothetical  results \" of unperformed tests as if they were numbers , one must be sure that these abstractions at least follow the axioms of numbers .",
    "there are several steps necessary to connect the  events \" of the physical world to numbers .",
    "boole derived ultimate alternatives and a boolean algebra while kolmogorov s axiomatic system introduces an event algebra and probability space .",
    "it is true that mathematicians often describe experimental situations or ideas about them by the kolmogorov framework and just postulate that a probability space and @xmath14-algebra exists .",
    "it is known , however , from the work of boole @xcite and vorobev @xcite that a given particular set of variables may not be able to describe certain correlations in any given set of data .    in more elementary terms",
    ", we have to consider the following facts .",
    "if we perform  calculations where these unknown results are treated as if they were numbers \" , then we must use the mathematical concept of functions or something equivalent in order to link the imagined but possible tests with numbers .",
    "a one to one correspondence of the possible tests and the numbers needs to be established and it needs to be shown that no logical - mathematical contradictions arise from such procedure .",
    "if no such correspondence exists , then the  purely intellectual activity \" is nothing more than child s play and the mathematical abstractions of such activity can certainly not be treated as if they were numbers with some relation to physics .",
    "take any set of data derived from measurements on spin-@xmath15 particles with stern - gerlach magnets , that lists the measured spins as  up \" or  down \" together with magnet settings @xmath16 .",
    "can we replace  up \" with @xmath17 and  down \" with @xmath18 and expect that the so obtained set follows the axioms of integers ?",
    "the  trespass \" to deal with tests as if they were numbers has been committed by several textbook authors , in particular by peres  @xcite and leggett  @xcite .",
    "this point appears in clear relief , if we write down the data according to the way in which they are imagined to be taken in testing e.g. the bell - type inequality .",
    "the data are recorded in pairs corresponding to detector - events that are registered together with equipment settings and the clock times of synchronized laboratory clocks .",
    "thus we obtain data lists of the kind : @xmath19 the @xmath20 representing the randomly chosen setting pair and @xmath21 denoting the times of measurement . the number of times that the setting @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 was chosen is denoted by @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the total number of pairs is then @xmath28 .",
    "one can not do justice to the number of different data - pairs by using models with three pairs of mathematical symbols such as @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 as they are used in bell - type proofs .",
    "one runs into problems even if one regards these mathematical symbols as  variables \" ( such as boolean variables  @xcite ) and not just as numbers ; the reason being that one can not cover all the different possible correlations of the data by such few variables . if we admit the two values @xmath17 and @xmath18 for the variables at different times of the same experiment , then we obtain @xmath32 different values for the sum of the pair product @xmath33 .",
    "if we have three such sums with all independent variables , the number of possibilities is @xmath34 for @xmath35 sufficiently large .",
    "in contrast , we have for the bell type variables @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 only about @xmath36 independent choices of all possible different correlations of possible outcomes of these variables .",
    "this fact arises from bell s description of @xmath37 different * pairs * of measurements ( @xmath38 measurements ) by only 3 different variables and represents another typical trespass that is explicitly made in both the book of peres  @xcite and leggett  @xcite : they use a model with a severe restriction of choices before any physics is introduced and thusoverburden \" their variables in a way which can not do justice to the complexity of the data . in real eprb experiments , one uses four not three different randomly chosen settings  @xcite but the above argument equally holds for this case , with @xmath39 and @xmath40 being replaced by @xmath41 and @xmath42 for @xmath43 different pairs ( @xmath44 measurements ) , respectively .",
    "this more subtle problem , a well known problem in the area of computer simulations , reveals once more the enormous gulf between data and mathematical abstractions that describe the data . in the framework of boole  @xcite",
    ", we need to be sure that the data can be described by ultimate alternatives ( the boolean variables ) and in the framework of kolmogorov we must be sure to deal with random variables ( functions on a kolmogorov probability space ) . but",
    "how can we be sure ? as a minimum requirement we need to introduce functions , with sufficiently many physical variables in their arguments , to enable the description of all the possible correlations and to guarantee a one to one correspondence of mathematical abstractions and the massive amount of data .",
    "to describe eprb experiments in the general way that bell intended and purported to actually have done , we need to introduce functions @xmath1 with variables additional to @xmath13 in their argument ( or indexes , see below ) . we need to have variables such as @xmath45 that are taken out of the realm of einsteinian physics and do indeed guarantee the one to one correspondence to the data .",
    "for example , we may need to include @xmath46 , the time of measurement at one location and @xmath47 representing any property of the objects emanating from the source .",
    "it may also be necessary to include a more general four dimensional space - time vector @xmath48 instead or in addition to the measurement time @xmath46 and we include it here just for completeness . this way we obtain functions @xmath49 . some may ask whether that is not precisely what bell used by introducing his @xmath5 that , as he claimed @xcite , can stand for any set of variables and , therefore , also for the set @xmath50 .",
    "we thus may have @xmath51 .",
    "indeed it is true that this is what bell claimed .",
    "however , as we will see below his claim is incorrect , because he and followers have postulated complete independence of @xmath5 and @xmath13 and thus postulated counterfactual definiteness in conjunction with the setting variable @xmath52 according to the precise definition given in the next section .",
    "einstein locality does not require independence of @xmath5 of the local setting ( see corresponding section ) .",
    "note that quantum mechanics does not use any setting - type of variable as independent variable in the argument of the wave - function .",
    "there , the setting - type variables label the operators . a helpful discussion of explicit and implicit assumptions of bell , with emphasis of the mathematical structure and consistency , was given by khrennikov  @xcite .",
    "counterfactual definiteness requires the following .",
    "we must be able to describe a measurement or test by using a given set of variables in the argument of the function @xmath1 , and thus for example a setting @xmath53 .",
    "then , we must also be able to reason that we could have used instead of setting @xmath54 the setting @xmath55 and would have obtained the outcome corresponding to the value of @xmath1 , now calculated with setting @xmath55 and all other variables in its argument unchanged .",
    "although this type of reasoning is not permitted in the courts of law , its mathematical restatement looks natural and general enough :    this definition means that the outcomes of measurements must be described by functions of a set of independent variables .",
    "the definition applies , of course , to the major theories of classical physics , including einstein s special relativity .",
    "counterfactual definiteness appears , therefore , as a reasonable and even necessary requirement of classical theories .",
    "however , most importantly , counterfactual definiteness restricts the use of variables to those that can be independently picked from their respective domains .",
    "however , a magnet- or polarizer - orientation , mathematically represented by the variable @xmath13 , can not be picked independently of the measurement times , which are mathematically represented by @xmath46 and registered by the clocks of the measurement stations .",
    "once a setting is picked at a certain space - time coordinate , no other setting can be linked to that coordinate , because of the relativistic limitations for the movement of massive bodies and the fact that bell s theory is confined to the realm of einsteinian physics and , therefore , excludes quantum superpositions .",
    "thus any measurement is related to spatio - temporal equipment changes and the mathematical variables that describe the measurement need to represent the possible physical situations .",
    "enter probability theory and we certainly can not use the setting @xmath13 as a random variable and the measurement time @xmath56 as another _ independent _ random variable on the same probability space .",
    "the reason for this fact is rooted in the above explanation and can be further crystallized as follows .",
    "it is possible to define the setting @xmath13 as a random variable on one probability space meaning that we may regard @xmath13 as a function which assigns to each elementary event @xmath57 of a sample space @xmath58 a so called realization of @xmath13 e.g. @xmath59 .",
    "it is also possible , at least under very general circumstances , to formulate the measurement times as another random variable @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is an elementary event of a second sample space @xmath62 . again , given some specific @xmath63 we obtain a realization e.g. @xmath64 .",
    "however , the formation of a product probability space on which both random variables @xmath13 and @xmath56 are defined presents now a problem . that space would necessarily contain impossible events ( such as different settings for the same measurement times ) with a non - zero product probability measure assigned to them .",
    "these facts can actually be formulated as a theorem stating that setting and time variables of eprb experiments can not be defined on one probability space  @xcite .",
    "thus , the postulate of counterfactual definiteness in conjunction with the use of a setting variable restricts the independent variables additional to @xmath13 in the argument of bell s functions @xmath1 to a , physically speaking , narrow subset of variables that we denote by @xmath65 .",
    "this subset permits the physical description of static properties but can not handle dynamic properties expressed by space - time dependencies .    as a consequence ,",
    "the choices that can be made for variables in addition to the setting variable @xmath13 in bell s theory are extremely limited , particularly if these variables are related to space - time ( or space and time ) .",
    "this limitation is so severe that it is impossible to describe general dynamic processes of classical physics with bell s independent variables .",
    "the way to describe general dynamic processes in kolmogorov s framework is by using stochastic processes .    to describe a dynamics of eprb experiments one needs to use two dimensional vector stochastic processes , which involves several subtleties that , if neglected , lead to incorrect conclusions .",
    "a general vector stochastic process is in essence a vector of random variables , such as @xmath66 , whose statistical properties change in time ( we use here discrete time only ) .",
    "a precise mathematical definition can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , pp 1115 . in relation to eprb experiments",
    "we thus consider vectors such as @xmath67 .    a first difficulty that is usually encountered is related to the physics of spin measurements .",
    "according to bohr , the outcomes of measurements on each separate side of the eprb experiment are spin - up or spin down with equal likelihood , which appears to suggest stationarity or time - independence of the random variables @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "bohr s postulate , however , does not necessitate a time - independence of the statistical correlations between the random variables . this fact has been explained on the basis of a mathematical model involving time in ref .",
    "@xcite(pp 5560 ) and demonstrated by actual eprb related computer experiments  @xcite .",
    "a second difficulty arises from the fact , explained in detail above , that the time and setting related variables of eprb experiments can not be treated as independent .",
    "this difficulty can be resolved by use of the following two - dimensional system of functions ( vector stochastic process ) on a probability space @xmath58 : @xmath70 settings and times are now included as indexes that are not independent .",
    "@xmath71 represents the randomly chosen settings at one measurement place and @xmath72 at the second .",
    "@xmath46 as well as @xmath73 are the respective measurement times .",
    "@xmath74 indicates just the number of the experiment .",
    "only one setting can occur at one given time in order to avoid physical contradictions and incorrect assignments of probability measures .",
    "( note that a generalization of the time - indexes to space - time @xmath75 is straightforward . )",
    "bell s inequality then transforms to : @xmath76 where the labels @xmath77 are the appropriate , all different , experiment numbers for which the particular settings have been chosen .",
    "eq  ( [ 6aug15n2 ] ) puts no restrictions on the correlations of eprb experiments , because the actual experiments may now be represented by a countable infinite number of different functions instead of the three or four functions used by bell .",
    "there do exist theorems that appear to prove the validity of bell s inequality for stochastic processes ( the martingales discussed in @xcite are just special forms of stochastic processes ) .",
    "these theorems , however , do not use two - dimensional vector stochastic processes as used in eq  ( [ 6aug15n1 ] ) .",
    "they use , instead , counterfactual definiteness in conjunction with setting variables to arrive at three- , four- or higher dimensional stochastic processes ( martingales ) .",
    "thus these theorems can not encompass dynamic measurement processes  @xcite and time- ( space - time- ) related variables , because they would then imply the existence of events with more than one setting at a given measurement time and , therefore , involve impossible events with non - zero probability measure .",
    "such theorems apply , therefore , only to the set of variables @xmath65 as defined above and do not apply to eprb types of experiments that may involve dynamical processes in the measurement equipment .",
    "it is , therefore , imperative to view eprb experiments in a different light .",
    "a violation of bell - type inequalities need not be seen as crossing the border between the reasoning of classical einstein type of physics and quantum mechanics , but indicating a possible dynamics in the interactions of particles and measurement equipment .",
    "this possible dynamics is what needs to be investigated , particularly as contrasted to the characterization of the measurement equipment by a completely static symbol  @xcite .",
    "experimentalists have up to now not used bell s theorem and its implications to search for a many body dynamics of local equipment , but instead to  uncover \" the instantaneous dynamic influence of remote measurements , the so called quantum non - localities .",
    "some consider these non - localities to be the most profound development of modern physics @xcite .",
    "they maintain that the measurement of the entangled partner causes instantaneous influences over arbitrary distances .",
    "this search for influences due to distant events is based on the conviction , dating back to bell s original paper , that einstein locality is necessary to derive his inequality . however , this is not the case .",
    "bell s assumption that @xmath5 is independent of the setting variable @xmath13 is already contained in the postulate of counterfactual definiteness and einstein locality is not only redundant because of this fact , but does not require at all that @xmath5 be independent of all settings .",
    "variables dependent on the local setting and describing local many body interactions with the incoming particles are entirely permitted and necessary .",
    "it is counterfactual definiteness that requires that all additional variables such as @xmath5 are independent of the setting variable .",
    "but why does our classical theory need to involve the setting variable in the way bell has included it ?",
    "one can use the setting variable as an index together with another index related to or representing space - time .",
    "these indexes are , of course not independent as was pointed out above for stochastic processes .",
    "from these facts we can deduce that einstein locality is not a necessary condition for bell s derivation , rather the opposite .",
    "its correct implementation prevents the derivation of bell to go forward , as shown in eq  ( [ 6aug15n2 ] ) .",
    "the major premise for the derivation of bell s inequality is counterfactual definiteness , which in connection with bell s use of setting variables restricts the domain of the variables in the argument of bell s functions @xmath1 to a subset @xmath65 of general physical independent variables .",
    "@xmath65 does not include the variables necessary to describe a general dynamics describing many body interactions in the measurement equipment . using only the independent variables defined by @xmath65 , it is impossible to find a violation of bell s inequality , which therefore represents a demarcation between possible and impossible experience  @xcite , not between classical and quantum physics . for",
    "a wider parameter space that permits the description of dynamic processes and includes space - time coordinates , the validity of bell - type inequalities can not be and have not been derived .",
    "this situation is reminiscent of that with the last theorem of fermat before 1984 .",
    "there existed only rather trivial proofs of fermat s theorem for subsets of conditions ( e.g. @xmath78 ) , while a general proof was not known until andrew wiles supplied it in 1984 .",
    "such more complicated and general proofs of bell s theorem have not been presented and , in the authors opinion , are not likely to be presented in the future , because they would need to remove the use of the setting variable @xmath13 ."
