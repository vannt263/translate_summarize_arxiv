    "the `` visibilities '' obtained by radio interferometers have to be corrected for the unknown gains of the antennas along the signal path before they can be used to image the sky .",
    "this is a well known problem ( viz .",
    "`` calibration '' ) and calibration routines are available in several different interferometric data reduction packages .",
    "a special case of calibration arises when the array is such that a given antenna spacing is present multiple times .",
    "each baseline in such a `` redundant '' baseline set measures the same fourier component of the sky brightness distribution .",
    "the only differences between the copies are due to the different multiplicative gains and additive noise along the different signal paths . for a sufficiently redundant array ,",
    "this multiplicity of measurements of the same physical quantity allows simultaneous estimation of both the antenna gains as well as the true sky visibilities .",
    "some of the earliest work on `` redundancy calibration '' was done in the context of the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) @xcite .",
    "interest in redundancy calibration has been revived in the recent past because a number of new instruments ( e.g. the low frequency array(lofar)@xcite and the murchison widefield array(mwa)@xcite ) have some degree of redundancy at certain scales , to exploit specific engineering advantages .",
    "the lofar stations , for instance , have a redundant @xmath1 geometry that allows accurate calibration of each of the antennas within the station@xcite .",
    "further , certain astrophysics and cosmology experiments would benefit from redundant configurations for the telescope geometry : the cylinder array@xcite and baobab@xcite are specific examples , while @xcite discuss redundant configurations for redshifted @xmath2 studies such as the epoch of reionization(eor ) .",
    "many of the algorithms in previous work in redundancy calibration largely used linear least squares(lls ) algorithms to solve for the antenna gains and sky visibilities . in this paper , we apply a simple non - linear least squares(nls ) minimization algorithm and compare its performance against that of the lls algorithms .",
    "this is done using simulated data , with the simulations being done in the context of an ongoing upgrade of the ooty radio telescope .",
    "we also compute error estimates on the derived solutions , and compare the accuracy of these estimates against ensemble average errors derived from a monte - carlo simulation and the cram@xmath0r - rao bound(crb ) .",
    "at any instant of time , a two - element interferometer measures a single fourier mode ( called the visibility ) of the incident radiation field .",
    "the ( complex ) gains along each of the signal paths and the additive thermal noise cause the measured visibility to differ from the true visibility .",
    "mathematically :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the complex gains associated with the antennas @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively , @xmath8 is the true visibility of the sky corresponding to the baseline between antennas @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and @xmath9 is the complex - valued additive noise . for the sake of clarity",
    "we ignore other factors such as the primary beam of the ( assumed identical ) antennas and polarization leakage which would also cause the measured visibility to differ from the true one ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we also assume that phase variations arising from the ionosphere can be lumped together with the complex gain of the receiver chain , and that the correlator does not introduce any baseline based gains or errors .",
    "we return to a discussion of these assumptions in sec .",
    "[ ssec : resultsanddiscuss ] .    in order to recover the true visibility , the gains @xmath4 would have to be known , i.e. the interferometer would have to be calibrated .",
    "conceptually , the simplest way to do this would be to observe a region of the sky where the true visibilities @xmath8 are known ( viz .",
    "a _ calibrator _ source ) , and use the observed @xmath10 to solve for the gains . if the gain variation timescale is long compared to the time interval between observations of calibrator sources , the solutions can be interpolated in time to obtain the gains at some intermediate time , for e.g. a time when the _ target _ source , whose true visibilities one would like to estimate , is being observed . for a multi - element interferometer with @xmath11 elements ,",
    "the number of instantaneous visibility measurements go like @xmath12 , while the number of unknown gains are only @xmath11 .",
    "in addition the measured visibilities must obey the amplitude and phase closure constraints .",
    "as is well known , these facts can be used to iteratively refine both the gains and the visibilities , ( viz .",
    "self _ calibration ) provided some reasonable initial guess for the gains and the structure of the source is available(see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "another interesting case arises when the array is redundant , i.e. there are multiple instances of the same antenna separation .",
    "the observed visibilities on these redundant baselines would differ only by the instrumental gains and the additive thermal noise .",
    "if there is sufficient redundancy this would allow solving for the unknown antenna gains , as well as the true visibilities(viz .",
    "_ redundancy _ calibration ) , essentially independent of any assumed model for the sky ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "redundancy calibration algorithms discussed in the literature are broadly based on linear least - squares methods .",
    "one such example is the lls algorithm proposed by @xcite .",
    "we give a brief description below , and direct the interested reader to the longer discussion in the paper cited above and those of @xcite and @xcite .    ignoring the noise term @xmath9 and taking logarithm of equation  ( [ meqn ] ) we get : @xmath13 @xmath14",
    "the above system of equations can be written in the familiar matrix form @xmath15 separately for the amplitude and the phase equations , where @xmath16 is a column vector containing the ( amplitudes or phases of the ) observed visibilities on all the redundant baselines , @xmath17 is a column vector containing the antenna gains and the true visibilities on those baselines ( with the dimension of @xmath17 being significantly smaller than the dimension of @xmath16 ) and @xmath18 is a sparse matrix depending only on the array geometry .",
    "for example , for a uniformly - spaced linear @xmath11-element array , @xmath16 is of length @xmath19 while the length of @xmath17 is @xmath20 .",
    "specifically , for the amplitude equation (  [ eqn : rca ] ) : + @xmath21,\\hskip 0.1 in \\mathbf{x } = \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } \\ln|g_1| \\\\ \\ln|g_2| \\\\ \\ln|g_3| \\\\ \\vdots       \\\\ \\ln|g_n| \\\\ \\ln{m_{|1| } } \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\ln{m_{|n-2| } } \\\\     \\end{array } \\right]\\ ] ]    and0.15 in    @xmath22\\ ] ]    for the phase part of the solution , some elements of the matrix @xmath18 undergo a sign change corresponding to the complex conjugation of one of the gains , without the structure of the matrix itself being altered .",
    "as can be seen , the matrix @xmath18 is highly sparse , leading to fast computation of the solution @xmath23 in a single step separately for the amplitudes and the phases .",
    "we clarify that by @xmath24 we mean the generalized inverse @xmath25 . since the matrix @xmath18 is static , its inverse has to be computed only once , after which it can be used for all time intervals at which the redundancy calibration needs to be done .    while this method is straightforward to implement , it ignores the additive noise , and hence is suitable only in high signal - to - noise ratio(snr ) situations .",
    "liu et al.(2010 ) discuss the problems that arise if this algorithm is used in the low snr regime , and suggest an alternative algorithm .",
    "their method is based on linearizing the equations by considering a taylor series expansion of the complex exponentials in equation  ( [ meqn ] ) .    following a taylor series expansion and approximation to the linear term ,",
    "the complex gains and visibilities can be rewritten as 0.1 in    @xmath26\\ ] ]    @xmath27\\ ] ]    @xmath28\\ ] ]    @xmath29\\ ] ]    @xmath30    where @xmath31    the superscript denotes the fiducial guess for the various quantities that has to be provided at the start of the algorithm .",
    "finally , the reduced expression for the correction term reads as 0.1 in @xmath32 \\label{correqn}\\ ] ]    which can be written in matrix form as 0.1 in    @xmath33    unlike the earlier case the amplitude and phase equations are coupled .",
    "further , unlike the matrix @xmath18 , which depends only on the geometry of the array , the matrix @xmath34 depends on both the geometry of the array and the current estimate of the gains and true visibilities .",
    "it hence has to be updated and a fresh pseudoinverse computed for each iteration .",
    "note also that one has to supply the fiducial solutions @xmath35 and @xmath36 at the start .",
    "both the methods outlined above lend themselves to straightforward implementation using any one of the several available linear algebra libraries .",
    "another recent algorithm of interest is the weighted alternating least squares(wals ) algorithm proposed by @xcite(also see @xcite ) .",
    "the antenna gains and phases are obtained as the solutions that minimize the covariance matched weighted differences between the measured and the estimated visibilities : @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the vector of the antenna gains to be estimated and @xmath39 is the diagonal matrix of the gains .",
    "@xmath40 is the toeplitz matrix of the true visibilities(to be estimated ) of all baselines obtained from the compact set of visibilities @xmath41 from the unique baselines .",
    "@xmath42 is the noise power vector to be estimated and @xmath43 is the diagonal noise covariance matrix . the weighting factor is chosen as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the matrix of the measured visibilities .",
    "a model is assumed initially to estimate the gains @xmath46 from an eigenvalue decomposition . in the next step , these gains are used to estimate the visibilities @xmath47 .",
    "the procedure is repeated iteratively until a suitable convergence criterion is satisfied to obtain the estimates @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the first two methods outlined above estimate the amplitudes and phases of the gains and the visibilities . however the steepest descent algorithm based on non - linear least squares minimization , described below , estimates the gains and the visibilities directly as common numbers on the argand plane .",
    "the phases hence estimated are found to be free from the errors inherent in the logarithmic method or the linearized method of @xcite , where they are dounf to be unreliable when large .",
    "however alignment of the amplitudes and phases would still require external calibration as explained below .",
    "besides , all the above three methods use matrix inversion , resulting in @xmath50 operations . however , the wals method suggested by @xcite is capable of exploiting the redundant structure of the problem thereby achieving @xmath51 complexity , putting it on par with the steepest descent method described below .",
    "in the general case of arrays with arbitrary geometry , equation  ( [ meqn ] ) is routinely solved for the unknown antenna gains using non - linear least squares(nls ) minimization algorithms .",
    "it seems reasonable hence to try a similar method in the redundancy calibration case , with the difference being that one would solve not only for the unknown antenna gains , but also for the unknown true visibilities .",
    "we begin by defining a real - valued objective function    @xmath52    summed over all baselines , where @xmath53 is a real - valued weight .",
    "we aim to minimize the objective function @xmath54 with respect to the complex valued gains @xmath55 _ and _ the true sky visibilities @xmath56 .    for brevity ,",
    "henceforth we call the vector @xmath57 $ ] the parameter vector @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 = \\left         [ \\",
    "g_1,\\ g_2,\\ \\dots\\ g_n,\\ \\   m_{|1|},\\ m_{|2|},\\ \\dots\\ m_{|l|}\\ \\right ] \\ ] ]    corresponding to a redundant array consisting of @xmath11 antennas and @xmath60 redundant baselines .",
    "the solutions @xmath61 , being the estimates of @xmath58 that minimize @xmath54 , are those at which the derivatives of @xmath54 with respect to the elements of @xmath58 vanish uniformly , i.e.    @xmath62    and    @xmath63    0.1 in    these equations yield , upon some algebraic manipulation , the solutions    @xmath64    and    @xmath65    where the sum is taken over the appropriate redundant baseline sets .",
    "note that equations ( [ gainsol ] ) and ( [ vissol ] ) involve the ( unknown ) true gains and visibilities .",
    "this circularity can be circumvented by taking an iterative approach to the solution : one takes small steps in the direction of the true solutions , starting from an arbitrary initial guess .",
    "the corrective steps have to be taken in the direction of the negative gradient for the most rapid convergence .",
    "we redefine quantities in equations ( [ gainsol ] ) and ( [ vissol ] ) as @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively :    @xmath68    @xmath69    we additionally define a step size @xmath70 so that the solutions can be obtained iteratively as    @xmath71    @xmath72    of course , the rate of convergence will depend upon the value chosen for @xmath73 : if it is too small ( i.e. @xmath74 ) , convergence will be slow , on the other hand a large value ( i.e. @xmath75 ) , could lead to a situations where the algorithm fails to converge .",
    "there are well known methods ( such as , for example , the levenberg - marquardt method(see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ) for determining the optimal value for @xmath73 : however these require computation of the hessian matrix at each iteration , and are computationally more expensive . in our simulations below we use a fixed value of @xmath73 ( i.e. @xmath76 ) . while a fixed value for @xmath73 may not be optimal , it more than compensates for the expenditure of computing the hessian even if consuming a few more iterations .",
    "we now enumerate the steps involved in steepest descent method for estimating the antenna gains and the sky visibilities using the non - linear least squares algorithm given above :    1 .",
    "if this is the first time step being solved for , initialize the gains and model visibilities to @xmath77 = \\left [   ( 1 , 0),\\ ( 1 ,          0),\\ ( 1 , 0),\\ \\ldots(1 , 0 ) \\right]$ ] .",
    "otherwise set them to the solutions obtained for the last time step .",

    "the visibilities @xmath84 are known , and hence there is only one equation to work with , viz .",
    "( [ giter ] ) .",
    "we point out in passing a further similarity with the calibration of non - redundant arrays .",
    "consider the fundamental equation ( [ meqn ] ) which we rewrite here for the redundant array , ignoring the additive noise term .",
    "@xmath85    scaling @xmath86 by some complex constant @xmath87 while simultaneously scaling @xmath88 by @xmath89 leaves the equation unchanged .",
    "this is the well - known ambiguity problem of selfcal@xcite .",
    "equivalently , in the redundant calibration solution , the gain amplitudes are determinable only up to an overall scale factor ( and the visibility amplitudes to the inverse square of this scale factor ) .",
    "similarly the gain phases are determinable only up to a linear gradient ( and the visibility phases to the negative of this gradient ) . in this respect ,",
    "redundancy calibration is analogous to self-calibration.in the simulations described below , we use the known input source positions and the known input source fluxes to determine the overall scale factor and phase gradient . in practice these overall scale factors would have to be determined by some external calibration .",
    "other proposed ways to resolve these ambiguities ( see for e.g. the discussion in @xcite ) is to apply the following constraints to the solutions @xmath90    where @xmath91 is some mean gain known apriori , @xmath92 and @xmath93 is the antenna gain amplitude and phase respectively , and @xmath94 is the position vector of the @xmath95 element in the array . in the case of the ort , where the telescope is equatorially mounted , and the baseline lengths do not change with time , resolving these ambiguities by external calibration and the requirement that the gain solutions vary slowly but that the visibility solutions are constant with time is relatively more simple .",
    "the simulations were done in the context of the ongoing upgrade of the ooty radio telescope ( ort ) .",
    "the ort is an offset parabolic cylinder with its long axis parallel to the rotation axis of the earth @xcite .",
    "the cylinder is fed by a linear phased dipole array . as part of the upgrade the signals from these dipoles",
    "are digitized and then fed to a correlation receiver , greatly enhancing the instantaneous field of view and sensitivity of the telescope . more details of the upgrade and the design of the new receiver system can be found in @xcite .",

    "the error bars on the estimated gains have been magnified by a factor of @xmath97 and those on the estimated visibilities by a factor of @xmath98 to enable them to be seen clearly . ]",
    "the redundancy calibration algorithms were checked against simulated data from the upgraded ort .",
    "the simulator forms a part of a suite of programs intended to become an integrated software package for analysis of data from the upgraded telescope .",
    "the simulator generates the expected visibilities from a variety of sources including ( a ) a point source at the phase centre ( b ) a collection of point sources randomly distributed within the field of view and ( c ) a sky source distribution that follows the known source counts at the frequency of operation of the telescope , viz .",
    "325  mhz @xcite .",
    "since the ort is oriented in the north - south direction and is equatorially mounted , the projected baseline lengths between the feed dipole elements do not vary when tracking the source . a suitable co - ordinate system to work in",
    "is hence one in which the @xmath99 axis is oriented east - west , the @xmath100 axis north - south , and the @xmath101 axis chosen appropriately as to complete a right - handed cartesian system . sky positions would , as usual , be expressed in terms of the corresponding direction cosines ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "in such a co - ordinate system , it is easy to show that the visibility corresponding to a pair of feed dipoles separated by a distance @xmath103 for a point source of flux @xmath104 and equatorial co - ordinates ( @xmath105 ) is    @xmath106    we note that although the simulations have been done in the specific context of the ort , the non - linear steepest descent algorithm is generic and applicable to any redundant array . in the figure and results",
    "presented below we use a redundant configuration with upto 40 stations ( as appropriate for phase  i of the ort upgrade - see @xcite ) .",
    "however we have also run the simulations for arrays with as few as 5 stations , and find that the nls algorithm works well even in such situations .",
    "for all the simulations gaussian noise appropriate to the system temperature , rf bandwidth and integration time was added to the model visibilities .",
    "these simulated visibilities then formed the input to the different redundancy calibration algorithms .    the matrices @xmath107 and @xmath108 in the @xcite and @xcite algorithms are sparse and often singular : techniques like qr decomposition or singular value decomposition(svd ) would hence have to be used to solve the corresponding matrix equations .",
    "in our implementation we have used matrix calls from the gnu scientific library(gsl ) . in the non - linear method ,",

    "[ bias - comparison ] shows the antenna gains and phases estimated from a run of the logarithmic redundancy calibration algorithm of @xcite , compared against the same numbers estimated from a run of the nls algorithm , for a signal - to - noise ratio per visibility of @xmath97 .",
    "although the nls algorithm works well and provides unbiased solutions for a realistic sky model , this figure is shown here purposefully for the simplest input model , i.e. a point source at the phase centre , so as to illustrate the bias on the gains and phases at uniform snrs on all baselines .",
    "it can be seen that despite a reasonable signal - to - noise ratio and a simple sky model , the logarithmic method gives biased estimates . as described above",
    ", the principal aim of the @xcite method was to eliminate this bias , and in their paper they show results to validate that their method indeed does avoid the bias . in our implementation",
    "too , we find that the @xcite method gives unbiased results ; however for clarity we have shown only results from the nls method and the @xcite method in fig .",

    "the figure shows the known input parameters to the simulation as well as the mean and rms ( computed over the different runs , i.e. the ensemble rms ) of the estimated parameters .",
    "the rms has been scaled by a factor of 10 for the gains and 5 for the visibilities so that they can be seen clearly in the plot .",
    "as can be seen , the nls algorithm does an excellent job of recovering the parameters .",
    "although the linearized method described in @xcite avoids the bias inherent in the logarithmic methods , it is , as described above , computationally significantly more expensive than the @xcite method . figure  [ runtimes ] shows the time taken by the @xcite and nls algorithms as a function of the total number of antennas .",
    "the run times exclude the time taken for data i / o from the disk .",

    "note that there was no explicit multi - threading in our implementation , and no compiler optimization was used .",
    "the nls algorithm is significantly faster and is very effective in real - time calibration .",
    "since calibration is essentially an estimation problem , it is natural to ask what the errors on the estimated parameters ( i.e. the gains and visibilities in this case ) are , and how the errors obtained via the nls algorithm compare with fundamental bounds on the error , viz .",
    "as is well known ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the covariance matrix @xmath109 of the estimated parameters is related to the hessian matrix @xmath110 as    @xmath111    further , if the measurement errors are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d ) gaussian noise , then the hessian matrix is equal to the fisher information matrix and the variances estimated from the hessian matrix correspond to the cram@xmath0r - rao bound(see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the parameter errors estimated in this way would hence be a lower bound to the true error .",
    "[ crbstats ] shows a comparison between the mean ensemble error obtained from the simulations for runs with different system temperatures ( i.e. signal - to - noise ratio ) .",

    "[ errormatrix ] we show the `` kite plots '' : the hessian and covariance matrices .",
    "these matrices are clearly diagonally dominant . a good approximation to the variance",
    "can hence be obtained quickly by approximating the hessian matrix to be diagonal . in the simulation described above , this approximation leads to a difference of only @xmath113 in the values of the estimated standard deviation .",
    "since the diagonal approximation simplifies the inversion of the hessian , we could adopt this approximation in the levenberg - marquardt algorithm to refine the step size after each iteration .",
    "however , since we find that a constant step - size is adequate we do not pursue this any further here .",
    "the filled squares show the time taken by the nls algorithm for different number of antennas , and the open squares show the corresponding time taken by linearized method of @xcite .",
    "the corresponding solid lines show the empirical curves of the form @xmath114 with @xmath115 and @xmath116 for the @xcite and nls methods respectively , clearly reflecting the structure of the algorithm . ]    as stated in sec .",
    "[ sec : redcal ] we have been assuming that the beamshapes of the individual antenna elements are identical , and that the ionospheric phases can be lumped together with the electronic gains of the elements . in general these assumptions are only approximately true .",
    "further , we have been only dealing with a scalar equation , whereas , in the presence of phenomena which mix the two polarizations ( e.g. differential faraday rotation across the array , receptors whose response is not perfectly orthogonal , ( i.e. suffer from `` leakage '' , `` ellipticity '' , which themselves could in general vary across the field of view ) it is not possible to decouple the calibration of the nominally orthogonal polarizations .",
    "high dynamic range imaging would require one to address all of these issues , and there have been a number of algorithms proposed ( dubbed `` 3gc '' calibration algorithms . see for e.g. @xcite ) to address these issues .",
    "a further issue that is relevant in dealing with dipole arrays ( as is the case of the focal array at the ort ) is that there could be mutual coupling between the elements .",
    "addressing these issues for the ort is beyond the scope of the current paper , but we plan to return to these in future work .",
    "we discuss below some considerations which suggest that the approximations that we have made are reasonable to first order for the problem at hand .",
    "firstly , the ort measures only the polarization along the length of the telescope , i.e. north - south .",
    "the dipoles are hence arranged end - to - end , a configuration that one would intuitively expect to minimize mutual coupling .",
    "indeed measurements of the sensitivity indicate that the sensitivity of the ort increases linearly with the number of dipole signals added , again suggesting that the mutual coupling can be ignored to first order .",
    "further since the ort is equatorially mounted , the beams do not rotate in the sky as it tracks the source , and hence to the extent that the different sections have identical beams , the calibration issues are greatly simplified .",
    "interestingly , this means that the baseline lengths will also be fixed as it tracks the source , meaning that each element pair measures the same sky visibility at all times .",
    "finally since the `` array '' is small ( 530 m ) , phase i of the upgrade ( which breaks the array up into 40 elements ) falls within lonsdale s regime 1@xcite , where the traditional solution to the ionospheric phase suffices .",
    "phase ii , where every 2 m segment of the telescope will be digitized ( i.e. a compact array , wide field of view , although note that even in this case , the e - w field of view is limited to @xmath117 because of the reflector ) would fall into lonsdale s case 3 where each source in the field of view could be shifted by a time variable offset , that would need to be calibrated for .",
    "we note that the nls algorithm suggested above would also be useful to quantify the importance of effects .",
    "residuals ( obtained after calibration as described here ) between the visibilities measured on nominally redundant baselines would be indicative of the importance of the direction dependent effects .    r - rao bound . at lower system temperatures ,",
    "the errors reach the crb upon integration of fewer samples . at @xmath118",
    "= 1500 k , for example , many more samples would have to integrated than at @xmath118 = 150 k to attain the crb . ]",
    "we apply a standard iterative non - linear least squares ( nls ) minimization algorithm ( i.e. steepest descent ) to the problem of redundancy calibration .",
    "we apply this method to simulated data ; the simulations were done in the context of the ongoing upgrade of the ort .",
    "we find that the nls algorithm is fast and accurate compared to the linear least squares methods that has been used in the past .",
    "the linear method works with the logarithm of the antenna gains and the sky visibilities , and hence leads to biased estimates of these parameters even at modest signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "linearization using a taylor expansion of the logarithm in the equations used in the linear method has been proposed to circumvent this problem . in comparison to this , we find that the nls algorithm is fast as well as simple to implement .",
    "we also investigate the accuracy of the estimates obtained by the nls algorithm and find from a monte - carlo simulation that the ensemble parameter errors attain the cram@xmath0r - rao bound at moderate signal - to - noise ratios .",

    "<S> for radio interferometric arrays with a sufficient number of redundant spacings the multiplicity of measurements of the same sky visibility can be used to determine both the antenna gains as well as the true visibilities . </S>",
    "<S> many of the earlier approaches to this problem focused on linearized versions of the relation between the measured and the true visibilities . </S>",
    "<S> here we propose to use a standard non - linear minimization algorithm to solve for both the antenna gains as well as the true visibilities . </S>",
    "<S> we show through simulations done in the context of the ongoing upgrade to the ooty radio telescope that the non - linear minimization algorithm is fast compared to the earlier approaches . </S>",
    "<S> further , unlike the most straightforward linearized approach , which works with the logarithms of the visibilities and the gains , the non - linear minimization algorithm leads to unbiased solutions . </S>",
    "<S> finally we present error estimates for the estimated gains and visibilities . </S>",
    "<S> monte - carlo simulations establish that the estimator is indeed statistically efficient , achieving the cram@xmath0r - rao bound .    </S>",
