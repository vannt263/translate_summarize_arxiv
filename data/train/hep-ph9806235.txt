    "the new generation of ultrarelativistic heavy ion colliders , rhic at brookhaven and lhc at cern will hopefully probe the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) and chiral phase transitions within the next few years .",
    "these colliders will provide the first opportunity to study phase transitions predicted by qcd in controlled experiments .",
    "the main goal of the theoretical program associated with ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions is to provide a thorough understanding of the experimental signatures associated with the formation and evolution of the qgp as well as the chiral phase transition@xcite .",
    "a very important part of this program is to study the dynamical evolution from the initial state corresponding to the highly contracted nuclei through the thermalization stage and the onset of the qgp in local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the initial state after the collision is strongly out of equilibrium and there are very few quantitative models to study its subsequent evolution .",
    "current theoretical predictions for the dynamics of the initial stages of formation of a qgp are based on the hard and semihard aspects which are studied via perturbative parton cascade models .",
    "these assume that at large energy densities the nuclei can be resolved into their partonic constituents and the dynamical evolution can therefore be tracked by following the parton distribution functions through a relativistic transport equation which includes scattering through the perturbative parton - parton interactions which are dressed by medium effects@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the important ingredient in this program is a relativistic kinetic or boltzmann equation for the phase space distribution function of partons ( quarks and gluons ) whose collision terms incorporate the perturbative parton cross sections including screening effects that cut - off the infrared behavior@xcite .",
    "although relativistic kinetic transport equations provide a natural framework to study non - equilibrium phenomena and are based on successes in many different fields ( mostly at the non - relativistic level ) , their validity in the extreme situations envisaged to arise during the early stages of heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc is questionable at best .",
    "detailed microscopic derivations of relativistic transport equations@xcite reveal that several coarse - graining assumptions must be invoked to arrive at the kinetic equations beginning from the microscopic schwinger - dyson equations .",
    "the typical assumptions involve smooth and slow variations over microscopic time scales , which results in a condition that the time scales for relaxation be much longer than the typical microscopic scales .",
    "these assumptions had been discussed by geiger@xcite within the context of parton cascade models of the evolution and thermalization and more recently by bass et .",
    "al.@xcite within the framework of the relativistic quantum molecular dynamics approach . with time scales for thermalization predicted to be of order of @xmath3 ( chemical equilibrium is typically achieved on longer time scales ) the regime of validity of coarse - grained relativistic boltzmann equations may be restricted to hard partons with typical momenta @xmath4 .",
    "however for soft quarks or gluons or collective modes with typical scales determined by the debye ( or magnetic ) screening lengths ( at @xmath5 ) @xmath6 or wide resonances , such as vector mesons , whether this separation of scales is enough to justify the validity of the usual kinetic approach is questionable .",
    "there is a rekindled interest on a deeper understanding of quantum kinetics from microscopic quantum field theory , rather than from a semi - phenomenological approach and critical analysis of transport and kinetic approaches are beginning to emerge@xcite-@xcite .",
    "in particular recently the initial stages of pre - equilibration during which quasiparticle correlations begin to build had been investigated in a many body system@xcite .",
    "the pre - equilibrium stage can not be studied within a boltzmann approach because the early time dynamics depends on the initial preparation of the state and is determined by off - shell ( non - energy conserving ) processes@xcite .    unlike non - relativistic cases in which the validity of kinetic equations can be tested either numerically or experimentally as in condensed matter physics , the reliability of the approximations involved in obtaining relativistic kinetic equations in the high energy and density regimes to be probed at rhic - lhc",
    "can only be speculated at present .",
    "therefore , it is important to obtain insight into the dynamics of thermalization and relaxation and the validity of a kinetic description in simple model theories so as to provide a yardstick to use as a guiding principle .",
    "it is the goal of this article to study the description of thermalization and relaxational dynamics in a simple and _ exactly solvable _ many body theory to obtain a deeper understanding of the off - shell processes involved in thermalization and to provide a yardstick to test different approximations .",
    "the aspects that we seek to study in this article are the following :    * how do off - shell effects modify the dynamics of thermalization and relaxation ?",
    "by off - shell we here refer to processes that do not conserve energy on short time scales and threshold effects that are not incorporated in the usual boltzmann equation . these are responsible for quasiparticle properties such as widths and residues in the quasiparticle propagators . *   a detailed understanding of the relaxation of quasiparticles vs. that of bare and dressed particles and to explore the definition of a quasiparticle distribution function that is valid beyond the narrow width approximation . *   a comparison of the validity of markovian ( coarse grained ) approximations including the boltzmann equation , to the most general non - markovian description of relaxation .",
    "although we anticipate that the answer to these questions will in general depend on the details of the microscopic model , we propose to study a model which bears many properties of realistic quantum field theories and allows us to provide the answers to these ( and other ) questions to build intuition into more complex situations .    in section [ secmodel ]",
    "we introduce the model and analyze the dynamics from the point of view of the time evolution of an initially prepared density matrix and the solution of the heisenberg equations of motion .",
    "this analysis allows us to establish contact with the fluctuation dissipation relation . in section [ secgt ]",
    "we study in detail the time evolution of the distribution function and distinguish between bare particle and dressed particle and quasi - particle distributions .",
    "in section [ secnorm ] we discuss the exact solution in terms of normal modes and analyze the definition of the interpolating number operator that describes the relaxational dynamics . in section [ seckin ]",
    "we analyze the _ approximate _ relaxational dynamics in terms of i ) the boltzmann equation , ii ) the non - markovian quantum kinetic equation and iii ) a markovian approximation to the quantum kinetic equation . in section [ secnum ]",
    "we provide a numerical comparison of the exact and approximate kinetics .",
    "our conclusions and extrapolations to realistic quantum field theories are summarized in section [ seccon ] .",
    "as stated in the introduction , we seek to study aspects of quantum kinetics in a model that allows to compare approximate treatments of the relaxational dynamics to exact solutions .",
    "obviously even a simple interacting quantum field theory would not allow an exact treatment of the dynamics and the validity of the approximations leading to the kinetic description could not be tested .",
    "instead we sacrifice generality and study a model that has already been used in the literature to study aspects of decoherence and dissipation phenomena , and which shares many of the important features of a quantum field theory , such as renormalization and off - shell phenomena .    the physical situation that we have in mind",
    "is that of an initial distribution of bare particles that become in contact with a medium of high energy density which we will take to be in equilibrium at a given temperature @xmath7 and will be denoted by the ` bath ' . before interacting with the medium the particle(s )",
    "has a physical mass and travels freely , which in field theory would correspond to a description in terms of physical _ in _ fields of the physical mass .",
    "these bare particles will mix with the particles in the medium and form dressed states by shifting the mass and residues of the propagators .",
    "we will describe this scenario by a sudden coupling of the bare particle(s ) to the bath at an initial time which is taken to be @xmath8 .",
    "the initial density matrix is then factorized into a tensor product of a density matrix for the bare particles and another for the bath .",
    "the model that we choose to describe this situation is that of an oscillator of bare frequency @xmath9 ( representing the physical mass of the _ in _ particle states before the interaction ) coupled linearly with a bath with an infinite number of degrees of freedom given by harmonic oscillators with frequencies @xmath10 .",
    "although this is a drastic simplification of the theory that we are ultimately interested in describing , this model has already been used in studies of dissipation@xcite-@xcite decoherence@xcite , and also as models for entropy production in heavy ion collisions@xcite and more recently within the context of baryogenesis@xcite .",
    "the lagrangian is given by @xmath11\\,=\\,\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\dot{q}^2\\,-\\,\\omega_0 ^ 2q^2\\right)\\,+ \\,\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_k\\left ( \\dot{q}_k^2\\,-\\,\\omega_k^2~ q_k^2 \\right)\\,-\\,q\\sum_k c_k ~q_k,\\ ] ]    where the different coefficients of @xmath12 ( oscillator masses ) had been absorbed by a canonical transformation into a redefinition of the couplings @xmath13 .",
    "we now refer to the oscillator @xmath14 as the ` system ' i.e. the degree of freedom whose dynamics we are interested in studying , and the oscillators @xmath15 as the ` bath ' , these will be integrated out in the non - equilibrium effective action .",
    "the degree of freedom @xmath14 could be associated with a particle of a particular wave number , for example in the linear relaxation approximation to kinetics in which only one particular mode is displaced from equilibrium , whereas all of the other modes in the field theory remain in equilibrium . in this case",
    "the mode in question could be identified with the variable @xmath14 and the other modes in equilibrium with the bath .",
    "we will eventually take the limit in which the bath oscillators are distributed continuously by introducing the bath spectral density @xmath16 and where appropriate replacing the discrete distribution with a continuum one in the following manner :    @xmath17 in such a way that @xmath18    our main goal is to study the evolution of the number of excitations or ` particle distribution ' associated with the quanta of the system .",
    "anticipating self - energy renormalization effects by the medium , we define a reference frequency @xmath19 and introduce the operator that counts the number of quanta of the system s degrees of freedom associated with this frequency    @xmath20\\,-\\,\\frac{1}{2}\\ ; , \\label{number}\\ ] ]    where @xmath21 is the momentum of the particle .",
    "the reference frequency could either be taken to be the bare frequency @xmath9 , or the ` in - medium ' frequency renormalized by the interaction with the bath and we will leave this choice unspecified for the moment .    since the theory is quadratic we can resort to a number of different ways to study the dynamical evolution :    1 .",
    "given an initial density matrix we can evolve it in time exactly and obtain all of the non - equilibrium correlation functions .",
    "the heisenberg equations of motion for the operators can be solved exactly and again we can obtain any correlation function .",
    "the normal modes can be found exactly , from which we can find the _",
    "exact _ ground state and also obtain the operators that create the particle or quasiparticle states to study the asymptotic evolution of non - equilibrium states .",
    "we compute exactly the expectation value of the proposed number operator in the canonical ensemble of the system plus bath and compare the result to the asymptotic form of the non - equilibrium distribution function .",
    "this allows an unequivocal description of thermalization in terms of the density matrix .",
    "we will pursue all of the above different approaches , since each particular method provides different insights and the main goal is to understand this simpler model in detail to provide intuition into the more complicated case of field theories .      the first method is to calculate the time evolution of the reduced density matrix , @xmath22 , of the particle that has been prepared at some initial time @xmath23",
    ".    this can be achieved by treating the infinite set of harmonic oscillators , @xmath15 , as a ` bath ' and obtaining an influence functional@xcite-@xcite by tracing out the bath degrees of freedom .",
    "we assume that the total density matrix for the particle - bath system decouples at the initial time @xmath23 , i.e. @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the density matrix of the bath which describes infinite set of harmonic oscillators in thermal equilibrium at a temperature @xmath7 and @xmath26 is the density matrix of the particle which is taken to be that of a harmonic oscillator in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath27 .",
    "more complicated initial density matrices , including correlations between system and bath degrees of freedom can be studied by following the methods found in@xcite .",

    "the vanishing of the relaxation rate at the initial time is a consequence of the fact that the initial density matrix is diagonal in the number representation , thus whereas the quantum kinetic equation describes correctly the initial evolution , the boltzmann equation has coarse grained over these time scales and misses the early time behavior .",

    "obviously the time scales for relaxation and the early time dynamics are features not reproduced by the boltzmann equation and clearly a result of off shell effects , since all of the energy conserving detailed balance processes are contemplated by the boltzmann equation .",

    "this case provides for strong renormalization effects because the wave function renormalization departs significantly from one .",
    "the left figure for @xmath70 depicts clearly the dressing time of the particle , with @xmath72 we see that after a short time the asymptotic value @xmath302 is achieved .",
    "this figure thus reveals _ two _ time scales , one associated with the oscillation scale of the dressed particle @xmath303 and the other associated with the decay to the asymptotic form , this time scale determines the dressing time of the particle and for the case under consideration corresponds to just a few oscillations .",
    "this dressing time scale clearly depends on the details of the spectral density since it determines the early time dynamics after the preparation of the initial state . the right figure for @xmath70 presents",
    "_ three different _ time scales : initially there is the time scale of formation of the quasiparticle , very similar to the left figure , the time scale associated with the quasiparticle pole @xmath304 and finally the time scale associated with the exponential decay .",
    "the formation time scale and that of exponential decay can only be resolved in the narrow width approximation , in this particular example @xmath305 and the time scales associated with the quasiparticle formation from the initial state and exponential relaxation can be resolved .",
    "these are clearly displayed in fig.[quasiform ] where the logarithm of the maxima of @xmath70 is plotted versus time . in fig.[nbeab ] we show the expectation value of the number operator eq.([number ] ) for @xmath172 for the same values of the parameters as in fig.[nearth ] ( left figure corresponds to pole below threshold and right figure to the pole above threshold ) and equal particle and bath temperature @xmath306 . whereas the boltzmann equation predicts again no relaxation , in the left figure because the damping rate vanishes and in the right figure",
    "because the on - shell gain and loss processes balance each other , the exact and quantum kinetics description of relaxation both predict non trivial evolution of the dressed particle and quasiparticle distribution functions respectively .",
    "the left figure shows that whereas the quantum kinetic and markovian evolution are not too different from the exact , asymptotically all of them depart significantly from boltzmann .",
    "the early time dynamics predicted by the markovian and quantum kinetics are very close to the exact expression . in the right figure , corresponding to a narrow resonance we see that asymptotically the quantum kinetic and markovian evolution asymptotically approach the boltzmann result but obviously the early and intermediate time dynamics is remarkably different .",

    "this figure clearly shows that the boltzmann approximation coarse grains over the early time behavior and completely misses the formation time scales and the early details of relaxation .",
    "finally , fig.[rholike ] presents the evolution of the quasiparticle distribution for a case of a strong coupling regime resulting in a wide resonance : @xmath310 for a bath temperature @xmath311 and zero initial particle temperature .",
    "the ratio @xmath312 is comparable to that of a realistic vector meson , such as for example the neutral @xmath313 meson .",
    "the inset in the figure displays the early time behavior .",
    "we see in this figure that whereas the early time behavior is similar for the exact and approximate evolutions , which is a consequence of zero initial temperature for the particle , at times of the order of the relaxation time there is a dramatic departure .",
    "furthermore the boltzmann approximation predicts a very different early time evolution because it coarse grains over the formation time of the quasiparticle .    whereas the quantum kinetic evolution and its markovian approximation track very closely the boltzmann , the exact evolution is approximately @xmath314 smaller resulting in a smaller population of resonances asymptotically .",
    "the departures in the exact result are a consequence of off - shell effects associated with a large width of the resonance , since in the narrow resonance approximation and for @xmath156 so close to one , the asymptotic limit of the exact solution coincides with that of the boltzmann equation .",
    "the goal of this article is to study the dynamics of thermalization including off - shell effects that are not incorporated in a boltzmann description of kinetics . in particular",
    "the focus is to assess the validity of the boltzmann approximation as well as non - markovian and markovian quantum kinetic descriptions of relaxation and thermalization in a model that allows an exact treatment .",
    "although the model treated in this article allows an exact solution and therefore provides an arena to test the regime of validity of several approximate descriptions of kinetics and compare to an exact result , it is obviously not a full quantum field theory .",
    "specific field theory models used to obtain a microscopic description of thermalization and relaxation will certainly contain details that are not captured by the model investigated here .",
    "however , from the exhaustive analysis in this article we believe that some of the results obtained here are fairly robust and trascend any particular model .",
    "these are the following :    * * boltzmann vs. quantum kinetics : * a necessary criterion for the validity of a boltzmann approach is that there is a clear and wide separation of time scales between the microscopic time scales and the time scales of relaxation .",
    "this is typically the situation in which quasiparticles correspond to very narrow resonances in the spectral functions and their lifetime is much longer than the typical microscopic scales .",
    "if perturbation theory is applicable _ and _ the quasiparticle resonance is narrow and its position is far away from thresholds , then a boltzmann description is likely to be reliable for time scales longer than the formation time of the quasiparticle . when there is competition of time scales or the early stages are physically relevant a full quantum kinetic equation must be obtained . * * microscopic time scales : * in order to determine the microscopic time scales the first step is to determine the position of the resonances or quasiparticles , i.e. the quasiparticle pole including the medium effects . the bare particle poles _ do not _ determine the microscopic time scales . obviously for weakly interacting theories",
    "the position of the bare and quasiparticle poles will be very close and the microscopic time scales are similar . * * relaxational time scales : * an estimate of the relaxational time scale is determined by the width of the resonance , @xmath130 , a wide separation of time scales that would provide a necessary condition for the validity of a boltzmann approximation would require that @xmath315 . *",
    "* thresholds : * although a wide separation of time scales is a necessary condition for the validity of a boltzmann approach , it is not sufficient . in particular when the position of the resonance is too close to threshold , there will be important corrections to the long and short time dynamics arising from the behavior of the spectral density at threshold .",
    "threshold effects can lead to strong renormalization of the amplitude of the quasiparticle pole ( wave function renormalization ) that results in sizable distortions of the equilibrium distributions as compared to the free particle ones .",
    "in particular we have seen how thermalization is achieved but with large corrections in the quasiparticle distribution functions from the usual bose - einstein form . * * formation times , markovian vs. non - markovian kinetics : * the model that we have studied allowed us to explore the concept of the formation time of a quasiparticle .",
    "this concept is simply unavailable within a boltzmann approach , since the boltzmann equation coarse grains over the formation time scales .",
    "this is clearly revealed in figures [ quasiform ] and [ nearth2 ] .",
    "both the non - markovian quantum kinetics and its markovian approximation include off - shell effects and capture the early time dynamics associated with the formation of the quasiparticle .",
    "the formation time of a quasiparticle becomes relevant if the initial state is very far from equilibrium , since in a non - linear evolution , large initial departures can result in large corrections in the asymptotic region .",
    "an important message learned in this work is that even in strongly coupled cases a non - markovian quantum kinetic description provides a very good approximation to the correct dynamics for most of the relevant time scale .",
    "a markovian approximation that is obtained by extracting the distribution functions from inside the non - local time integrals , but without taking the interval of time to infinity offers a viable description , which is close to the exact evolution and that of the non - markovian quantum kinetics at weak and intermediate couplings . its main advantage is computational because this approximation provides a local update equation . *",
    "* implications for field theory : * the lessons learned in this article allow us to provide some sound implications for realistic field theoretical models . in particular for example in the dynamics of thermalization of the quark - gluon plasma , we are led to the conclusion that a boltzmann description of thermalization could be reliable for _ hard _",
    "partons for which i ) the perturbative ( medium corrected ) scattering cross sections and ii ) the initial parton distribution seem to lead to a separation between the ( short ) microscopic scale ( determined by the inverse of the hard momentum of the parton ) and the relaxation time scale for partons with typical energies larger than say about 1 gev@xcite . + for soft degrees of freedom we envisage strong departures from a boltzmann description and the necessity of a quantum kinetic description .",
    "this view is supported by recent studies of anomalous relaxation of quasiparticles in ultrarelativistic plasmas@xcite in which infrared and threshold effects lead to very different relaxational dynamics as compared to the predictions based on quasiparticle resonances@xcite . in this case , as advocated in ref.@xcite a quantum kinetic description begins by resumming the perturbative expansion for the time evolution of the distribution function for the quasiparticles and keeping memory effects in a full non - markovian description . a markovian approximation that leads to local update equations",
    "can be obtained in weak coupling but without invoking energy conservation in intermediate states .",
    "this markovian approximation has been shown in this article to be very close to the non - markovian quantum kinetics .",
    "unlike a fully coarse grained boltzmann description , this intermediate markovian equation describes rather well the initial stages of quasiparticle formation and offers a local update alternative to non - local kinetics which includes off - shell effects .",
    "+ we expect large corrections to boltzmann relaxation in the case of wide hadronic resonances such as for example vector mesons near the chiral phase transition . for typical vector mesons",
    "both effects that lead to strong corrections are present : the ratio of the width of the resonance to the position of the resonance ( quasiparticle pole ) is not much smaller than one , for example in the case of the @xmath313 vector meson is about @xmath316 in vacuum , furthermore in medium , the position of the resonance is not too far from thresholds . in these cases",
    "we conclude that a non - markovian quantum kinetic description will be needed to understand reliably the abundance of resonances in the medium and their thermalization time scales .",
    "departures from boltzman abundances in medium could lead to experimentally observable effects in dilepton and photon spectra from hadronic resonances for example . +",
    "as presented in this article and advanced in previous work@xcite , a non - markovian , quantum kinetic description can be provided from a microscopic field theory model by beginning with perturbation theory , and resumming the perturbative expansion including off shell effects .",

    "<S> we study the dynamics of relaxation and thermalization in an exactly solvable model with the goal of understanding the effects of off - shell processes . </S>",
    "<S> the focus is to compare the exact evolution of the distribution function with different approximations to the relaxational dynamics : boltzmann , non - markovian and markovian quantum kinetics .    </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution of the occupation number or distribution function is evaluated exactly using two methods : time evolution of an initially prepared density matrix and by solving the heisenberg equations of motion . </S>",
    "<S> the former allows to establish a connection with the stochastic nature of thermalization and the fluctuation dissipation theorem , whereas the latter leads to the interpretation of an interpolating number operator to ` count ' quasiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> there are two different cases that are studied in detail : i ) no stable particle states below threshold of the bath and a quasiparticle resonance above it and ii ) a stable discrete exact ` particle ' state below threshold .    </S>",
    "<S> the exact solution for the evolution allows us to investigate the concept of the formation time of a quasiparticle and to study the difference between the relaxation of the distribution of particles and quasiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we compare the quasiparticle distribution for asymptotic times with the equilibrium canonical distribution . for the case of quasiparticles in the continuum ( resonances ) </S>",
    "<S> the exact quasiparticle distribution asymptotically tends to a statistical equilibrium distribution that differs from a simple bose - einstein form as a result of off - shell processes such as the strength of the quasiparticle poles , the width of the unstable particle and proximity to thresholds . in the case </S>",
    "<S> ii ) , the distribution of particles does not thermalize with the bath .    </S>",
    "<S> we study the kinetics of thermalization and relaxation by deriving a non - markovian quantum kinetic equation which resums the perturbative series and includes off - shell effects . </S>",
    "<S> a markovian approximation that includes off - shell contributions and the usual boltzmann equation are obtained from the quantum kinetic equation in the limit of wide separation of time scales upon different coarse - graining assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> the relaxational dynamics predicted by the non - markovian , markovian and boltzmann approximations are compared to the exact result of the model . </S>",
    "<S> the boltzmann approach is seen to fail in the case of wide resonances and when threshold and renormalization effects are important . </S>",
    "<S> implications for thermalization in field theory models are discussed .    </S>",
