    "the effects of background fields in quantum field theory are extensively analyzed from various perspectives .",
    "recent studies of the influence of a strong background magnetic field on properties of hot dense relativistic quantized matter have drawn the attention of researchers in diverse areas of contemporary physics , ranging from cosmology , astroparticle and high energy physics to condensed matter physics .",
    "relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite , compact astrophysical objects ( neutron stars and magnetars ) @xcite , the early universe @xcite , novel materials known as the dirac and weyl semimetals @xcite are the main physical systems where these studies are relevant .",
    "a source of the background magnetic field can be different , varying from one system to another . for condensed matter systems",
    ", one may simply apply an external magnetic field either to probe their physical properties or to better understand the underlying physics .",
    "in other cases , a generation of the magnetic field is the inherent property of the system . in the case of relativistic heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "very strong magnetic fields are produced during the early stages of the collision as a result of electric currents from the colliding charged ions @xcite ; because of the high electric conductivity of the medium , the appropriate fields may survive for as long as the lifetime of the quark - gluon plasma itself and , thus , have a profound impact on the plasma dynamics . in the case of compact stars ,",
    "the existence of strong magnetic fields is inferred from observational data @xcite ; even though the exact nature of the underlying mechanism responsible for a generation of such fields may still be debated , it is undoubted that such fields exist and play a significant role in the stellar physics . in the case of the early universe ,",
    "several competing mechanisms were proposed , providing for a generation of very strong magnetic fields @xcite ; despite the difference in details , the consensus is that rather strong magnetic fields should have been generated , since this is required by the present - day observation of weak , but nonvanishing , intergalactic magnetic fields .",
    "assuming that temperature and chemical potential , as well as the inverse magnetic length , exceed considerably the mass of a relativistic quantized spinor matter field , a variety of chiral effects emerges in hot dense magnetized matter in thermal equilibrium ; the lowest landau level is primarily responsible for this ; see review in @xcite and references therein .",
    "one of the basic effects is the chiral separation effect that is characterized by the nondissipative axial current along the direction of the magnetic field strength , @xmath0 , @xcite @xmath1 note that the current is linear in chemical potential @xmath2 and spinor particle charge @xmath3 , being independet of temperature @xmath4 .",
    "so far chiral effects were mostly considered in unbounded ( infinite ) matter , which may be relevant for cosmological applications , perhaps . for all other applications ( to astroparticle , high energy and condensed matter physics )",
    ", an account has to be taken of the finiteness of physical systems , and the role of boundaries in chiral effects in bounded matter has to be clearly exposed .",
    "the concept of quantized matter fields which are confined to bounded spatial regions is quite familiar in the context of condensed matter physics : collective excitations ( e.g. , spin waves and phonons ) exist only inside material samples and do not spread outside .",
    "nevertheless , a quest for boundary conditions ensuring the confinement of quantized matter was initiated in particle physics , in the context of a model description of hadrons as bags containing quarks @xcite .",
    "motivations for a concrete form of the boundary condition may differ in detail , but the key point is that the boundary condition has to forbid any flow of quark matter across the boundary , see @xcite .",
    "however , from this point of view , the bag boundary conditions proposed in @xcite are not the most general ones .",
    "it has been rather recently realized that the most general boundary condition ensuring the confinenent of relativistic quantized spinor matter within a simply connected boundary involves four arbitrary parameters @xcite , and the explicit form of such a condition has been given @xcite . to study an impact of the background magnetic field on confined matter , one has to choose the magnetic field configuration with respect to the boundary surface .",
    "the primary interest is to understand the effect of a boundary which is transverse to the magnetic field strength lines .",
    "then the simplest geometry is that of a slab in the uniform magnetic field directed perpendicular .",
    "it should be noted that such a geometry can be realized in condensed matter physics by putting slices of dirac or weyl semimetals in an external transverse magnetic field .",
    "note also that the slab geometry is conventional in a setup for the casimir effect @xcite , see review in @xcite .    as a first step toward the full theory of chiral effects in bounded matter ,",
    "the authors of @xcite considered the chiral effects in dense magnetized ultrarelativistic spinor matter at zero temperature in a slab with the use of the bag boundary condition of @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to extend the consideration to the case of nonzero temperature and the most general boundary condition .    in the next section",
    ", some basics of the formalism of quantum field theory in thermal equilibrium are reviewed .",

    "because of this circumstance , the axial current density is discontinuous at @xmath146 in @xcite .",
    "as well , the chiral separation effect at zero chemical potential disappears in @xcite at zero temperature , instead of ( 60 ) .",
    "however , on theoretical grounds , the involvement of the vacuum fluctuations looks more consistent .",
    "mention at least that , although the range of @xmath137 is restricted to @xmath148 [ see ( 22 ) ] , namely the account for the contribution of the vacuum fluctuations allows one to consider the axial current as a periodic continuous function of @xmath137 on the whole unrestricted range , @xmath149 .    concluding this section ,",
    "let us note that expression ( 1 ) is related to a quantum anomaly , being of topological nature which is revealed in the approach using the effective lagrangian for goldstone bosons of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "although the approach takes no account of temperature , it would be interesting to apply it to systems which are bounded in the direction of a magnetic field and to elucidate the role of the corresponding boundaries by determining the additional boundary terms ( perhaps of the chern - simons type ) to the effective lagrangian .",
    "this will allow one to point at a complementary way for obtaining the chiral effects in a slab at zero temperature .",
    "in the present paper , hot dense ultrarelativistic spinor matter in a slab under an influence of the transverse background magnetic field has been considered .",
    "an issue of boundary conditions plays the key role in this study . in the case of the quantized electromagnetic matter field ,",
    "a choice of boundary conditions is motivated by material properties of bounding plates , and the conventional casimir effect is different for different boundary conditions .",
    "for instance , it is attractive between the ideal - metal plates ( i.e. made of material with an infinitely large magnitude of the dielectric permittivity ) , as well as between the plates made of material with an infinitely large magnitude of the magnetic permeability ; meanwhile , it is repulsive between the ideal - metal plate and the infinitely permeable one ; see , e.g. , @xcite . in the case of the quantized spinor matter field",
    ", nothing can be said about the `` material '' of boundaries , other than to admit that this material is impenetrable for spinor matter .",
    "therefore , rather than attempting to model the microscopic details of the `` material '' of bounding plates , we have encoded the nature of boundaries in the values of parameters of the boundary condition ensuring the confinement of spinor matter inside the slab in the most general way .",
    "mathematically acceptable , i.e. compatible with the self - adjointness of the dirac hamiltonian , is the eight - parametric boundary condition ; see ( 24 ) and ( 25 ) .",
    "the six - parametric boundary condition corresponding to @xmath85 is consistent with the axial charge conservation ; see ( 27 ) .",
    "however , note that , as a massless spinor particle is reflected from an impenetrable boundary , its helicity is flipped . since the chirality equals plus or minus the helicity ,",
    "chiral symmetry has to be necessarily broken by the confining boundary condition .",
    "thus the case of @xmath85 is not acceptable on the physical grounds .",
    "moreover , the requirement of an invariance with respect to rotations around a normal to the slab yields restriction @xmath150 , and the boundary condition becomes a four - parametric one ; see ( 29 ) .",
    "a further physical requirement is that a standing wave inside the slab be unambiguously determined ; this yields restriction ( 30 ) , resulting finally in the two - parametric boundary condition [ see ( 33 ) ] .",
    "it should be noted that this condition breaks the time reversal symmetry , unless @xmath151 .",
    "however , standing waves inside the slab are @xmath152 independent [ their wave number vectors are given by ( 41 ) ] , meaning that the physical effects of hot dense magnetized ultrarelativistic spinor matter in a slab are the same , irrespective of whether the time reversal symmetry is conserved or broken .",
    "we have shown that the vector current and the axial charge are not induced by the background magnetic field in a slab ; see ( 36 ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of the unbounded medium , when such quantities are nonvanishing independently of chemical potential and temperature .",
    "really , owing to chiral symmetry , @xmath153_- = 0,\\label{eq63}\\ ] ] one can introduce the following average [ cf .",
    "( 14 ) ] : @xmath154|{\\bf r}\\right\\rangle , \\label{eq64}\\ ] ] where @xmath155 denotes the chiral chemical potential .",
    "then a straightforward calculation with the use of wave functions of definite chiralities immediately yields @xmath156 and @xmath157 ;   \\label{eq66}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that only the lowest landau level contributes to ( 65 ) which is known as the chiral magnetic effect @xcite . in the case of a bounded medium , although relation ( 63 ) formally holds , one can not determine a calculable version of average ( 64 ) , because , as was already emphasized , the boundary condition breaks chiral symmetry .",
    "for instance , standing waves inside a slab are formed from counterpropagating waves of opposite chiralities .",
    "thus , the chiral magnetic effect in a slab is prohibited by the confining boundary condition ; see ( 26 ) .    as to the chiral separation effect",
    ", we have shown that the axial current in a slab depends on both chemical potential and temperature ; see ( 53 ) and ( 54 ) .",
    "this is a main distinction from the unrealistic case of the unbounded medium , when the chiral separation effect is independent of temperature ; see ( 1 ) . at zero temperature ,",
    "the chiral separation effect in a slab is characterized by a stepwise behaviour with the step width equal to @xmath158 ; see ( 57 ) . as the temperature increases ,",
    "the steps are smoothed out , resulting in a linear behaviour at an infinitely large temperature ; see ( 58 ) .",
    "another distinctive feature is the dependence of the chiral separation effect on the boundary parameter , @xmath137 : all values from range @xmath159 are allowable on an equal footing with value @xmath160 . only at an infinitely large temperature",
    "is the chiral separation effect independent of the boundary parameter , as well as of the slab width , coinciding with the chiral separation effect in the case of the unbounded medium . otherwise , if the temperature is finite , a positive or negative term is added to the value of the chemical potential contributing to the axial current density , and the whole pattern is shifted along the line corresponding to the case of infinite temperature either to the right or to the left ; see ( 54 ) . in particular , the chiral separation effect can persist even at zero chemical potential : the axial current density is nonzero , being of the same ( opposite ) sign as @xmath161 at @xmath162 ( @xmath163 ) ; see ( 59 ) .",
    "perhaps , it is for the first time that such a mathematical entity as the self - adjoint extension parameter , @xmath137 , is to be determined experimentally ( maybe , at least as an event - by - event fluctuation )",
    ". it would be interesting to verify this in tabletop experiments with slabs of dirac or weyl semimetals in a transverse magnetic field .",
