    "two body problems are very classical in celestial mechanics and have been studied thoroughly since kepler discovered the laws of motion of celestial objects ( e.g. , aitken 1964 , goldstein 1980 , danby 1988 , roy 1988 , murray and dermott 1999 , beutler 2004 ) .",
    "the regular orbits of a system of two masses in newtonian mechanics are of three types : ellipse , parabola and hyperbola .",
    "the latter two cases , in which the separation of two bodies will become infinite in the remote future , may be called open orbits .",
    "the singular orbit is a linear one corresponding to a head - on collision , which is extremely special . in this paper",
    ", we consider regular orbits mentioned above : for a binary system , the orbit determination may bring us some informations about its formation and evolution mechanism . in an open orbit , one may infer an impact parameter and an initial relative velocity of two masses , one of which may be ejected by some explosive mechanism such as a supernova or by three body scattering .",
    "for instance , some observations reveal that kicked pulsars move at unusually high speed ( anderson et al .",
    "1975 , hobbs et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the orbit determination of _ visual double stars _ was solved first by savary in 1827 , secondly by encke 1832 , thirdly by herschel 1833 and by many authors including kowalsky , thiele and innes ( aitken 1964 for a review on earlier works ; for the state - of - the - art techniques , e.g , eichhorn and xu 1990 , catovic and olevic 1992 , olevic and cvetkovic 2004 ) . here , a visual binary is a system of two stars both of which can be seen .",
    "the relative vector from the primary star to the secondary is in an elliptic motion with a focus at the primary .",
    "this relative vector is observable because the two stars are seen . on the other hand , an _",
    "astrometric binary _ is a system of two objects where one object can be seen but the other can not like a black hole or a very dim star . in this case , it is impossible to directly measure the relative vector connecting the two objects , because one end of the separation of the binary , namely the secondary , can not be seen .",
    "the measures are made in the position of the primary with respect to unrelated reference objects ( e.g. , a quasar ) whose proper motion is either negligible or known .    as a method to determine the orbital elements of a binary , an analytic solution in an explicit form",
    "has been found by asada , akasaka and kasai ( 2004 , henceforth aak ) .",
    "this solution is given in a closed form by requiring neither iterative nor numerical methods .",
    "one may naturally seek an analytic method of orbit determination for open orbits .",
    "an extension for open orbits done earlier by dommanget ( 1978 ) used the thiele - innes method , namely solved numerically the kepler equation . as a result , the method by dommanget does not provide an explicit solution in a closed form .",
    "therefore , let us extend the explicit solution by aak to open orbits .",
    "then , we would face the following problem .",
    "aak formalism uses a fact that the semimajor and semiminor axes of an ellipse divide it into quarters .",
    "this fact plays a crucial role in determining the position of the common center of mass on a celestial sphere ; we should note here that the projected common center of mass is not necessarily a focus of an apparent ellipse .",
    "the division into quarters is possible for neither a parabola nor a hyperbola .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to generalize aak approach so that we can treat an open orbit .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "sec . 2 presents a generalized aak formalism . in sec .",
    "3 , the generalized approach is employed to obtain the method of orbit determination for a hyperbolic orbit . in sec . 4 , the formula for a parabolic orbit is presented . in sec .",
    "5 , we recover these formulae by making a suitable transformation of that for an elliptic orbit with some limiting procedures .",
    "6 is devoted to conclusion .",
    "we denote by @xmath0 the cartesian coordinates on a celestial sphere that is perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "a general form of an ellipse on a celestial sphere is @xmath1 which is characterized by five parameters ; the position of its center , the length of its semimajor / semiminor axes and the rotational degree of freedom . by at least five measurements of the location of a star , one can determine all the parameters .",
    "henceforth , we adopt the cartesian coordinates @xmath2 such that the apparent ellipse can be reexpressed in the standard form as @xmath3 where we assume @xmath4 without loss of generality .",
    "the ellipticity , @xmath5 , is @xmath6 .",
    "a focus of the original keplerian ellipse is not always that of the apparent one because of the inclination of the orbital plane .",
    "we should note that a focus of the original keplerian orbit is the common center of mass of a binary , around which a component star moves at the constant - areal velocity following the keplerian second law ( the conservation law of the angular momentum in the classical mechanics ) .",
    "this enables us to find out the location of the common center of mass as shown below .",
    "a star is located at @xmath7 on a celestial sphere at each epoch @xmath8 for @xmath9 , where @xmath10 for @xmath11 . here",
    ", @xmath12 denotes the eccentric angle in the apparent ellipse but not the eccentric anomaly in the true one ; the eccentric anomaly of the original keplerian orbit is not observable .",
    "we assume anti - clockwise motion , such that @xmath13 for @xmath11 .",
    "all we must do in the case of the clockwise motion is to change the signature of the area in eq .",
    "( @xmath14 ) in the following .",
    "we define the time interval as @xmath15 .",
    "the common center of mass of the binary is projected onto the celestial sphere at @xmath16 .",
    "even after the projection , the law of constant - areal velocity still holds , where we should note that the area is swept by the line interval between the projected common center and the star .",
    "the area swept during the time interval , @xmath17 , is denoted by @xmath18 .",
    "the total area of the observed ellipse is denoted by @xmath19 .",
    "the law of the constant areal velocity on the celestial sphere becomes @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "\\label{areas}\\ ] ]    equation @xmath22 is rewritten explicitly as @xmath23 they are solved for @xmath24 and @xmath25 as @xmath26 where @xmath27    the periastron is projected onto the observed ellipse at @xmath28 .",
    "the ratio of the semimajor axis to the distance between the center and the focus of the ellipse remains unchanged , even after the projection .",
    "hence , we find @xmath29 the positional vector @xmath30 is still located on the apparent ellipse given by eq .",
    "we thus obtain the ellipticity as @xmath32      in the original derivation of aak formula , the fact that the semimajor and semiminor axes divide the area of the ellipse in quarters .",
    "this still holds even after the projection .",
    "namely the projected semimajor and semiminor axes divide the area of the apparent ellipse in quarters , though the original semimajor and semiminor axes are not always projected onto the apparent semimajor and semiminor ones . this way of the derivation",
    ", however , can be used for neither hyperbolic nor parabolic cases , where there are no counterparts of the semiminor axis .",
    "hence we shall employ another method .    in this paragraph",

    "this line intersects the original ellipse at points @xmath38 and @xmath39 . for later convenience ,",
    "we adopt the coordinates @xmath40 whose origin is located at the focus , by making a translation as @xmath41 .",

    "this area is divided into equal halves by the semimajor axis . even after the projection , the divided areas are still equal halves",
    ". hence one can determine the location of the projected @xmath47 as @xmath51 in the apparent ellipse coordinates , where we defined @xmath52 in this computation , it is useful to stretch the apparent ellipse along its semiminor axis by @xmath53 so that one can consider a circle with radius @xmath54 . in this stretching ,",
    "importantly , the areal division into equal halves still holds .",
