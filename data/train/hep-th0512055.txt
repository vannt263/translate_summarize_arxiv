    "quantum topological field theories , such as the chern - simons and @xmath0 models , are gauge - invariant and metric - independent theories . due to the latter characteristic",
    ", they can be used for the study of knot and link invariants in three dimensional ( @xmath1 ) spaces @xcite , and for the study of generalizations of these invariants appropriated to the dimension of the base manifold .",
    "this relationship between topological theories and knot invariants subsists even at the classical level , as has been shown in the abelian case @xcite , and also in the non - abelian case @xcite by means of a perturbative study of the classical equations of motion of topological theories coupled to external point - particles carrying non - abelian charge ( wong particles @xcite ) .",
    "the method presented in these references rests upon the fact that the classical action of the theory must retain its diffeomorphism - invariant character when it is evaluated on - shell .",
    "hence , the on - shell action of the chern - simons ( or @xmath0 ) theories coupled in a suitable manner to particles should yield link invariants in @xmath1 , just as the vacuum expectation value of the wilson - loop does within the quantum field approach .",
    "this result concerning the classical perturbative treatment can be rigorously proven and generalized to situations where the symmetry group is other than the group of diffeomorphisms of the base manifold @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this article , within the context of the ideas and procedures developed in references @xcite , is to apply the classical perturbative method outlined above to @xmath2 euclidean yang - mills theory , which yields and example of how the method works when the symmetry group is smaller than the full group of diffeomorphism .",
    "as it is well known , @xmath2 yang - mills is invariant under diffeomorphisms that preserve areas @xcite , which reflects in the fact that the wilson loop exhibits an exponential dependence on the areas of the loop @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 yang - mills theories have been studied in many contexts .",
    "for instance , they describe closed topological strings with bounded states , and q - deformed @xmath2 yang mills theories in riemann surfaces give topological invariants in one dimension higher @xcite . furthermore , under certain conditions , euclidean @xmath2 yang - mills theory mimics the confining phase of @xmath3 to a good degree of accuracy @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we apply the general method developed in @xcite to @xmath2 yang - mills theory coupled to external wong - particles .",
    "after presenting the model we discuss a perturbative scheme for solving the classical equations of motion , and calculate the on - shell action to the first two orders in the coupling constant . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we find a geometric interpretation of the invariants .",
    "we also discuss the consistency conditions that gauge invariance imposes over the classical equations of motion , and their relationship with the definition of the surface - invariants .",
    "to this end , we perform a gauge transformation that amounts to attaching a bundle of straight lines to each point of space . in this gauge ,",
    "area - invariants become neatly expressed in terms of the areas formed by the cross product among the tangent vectors to these `` fibers '' and those tangent to the curves .",
    "some final comments close this section .",
    "our starting point will be the action @xmath4 where the last term corresponds to the interaction of @xmath5 non - dynamical wong particles ( i.e. , classical particles with cromo - electrical charge ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath6 is the gauge coupling constant of the yang - mills field .",
    "since we are dealing with the euclidean theory , there is no distinction between `` greek '' ( @xmath7 etc . ) sub or super - scripts , so we shall use both indistinctly .",
    "we will use the following conventions for the @xmath8 generators @xmath9 of the @xmath10 algebra and for the gauge field @xmath11 : @xmath12= f^{abc}t^{c}\\\\ & & a_{\\mu}= a_{\\mu}^{a}t^{a}\\\\ & & a_{i}=a_{\\mu}(z_{i}(\\tau))\\dot{z}^{\\mu}_{i}(\\tau).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as dynamical variables we take the potentials @xmath13 and the @xmath14 matrices in the fundamental representation @xmath15 , associated with the internal degrees of freedom of the wong particles @xcite . instead",

    "the curves @xmath17 drawn by the particles are then taken as closed curves in the euclidean plane , surrounding surfaces @xmath18 whose  area - invariants \" we are going to study .    in equation ( [ 2.1a ] ) we use the covariant derivative along the world - line of the @xmath19-particle : @xmath20 .",
    "also , it appears @xmath21 , which is a constant element of the algebra related to the initial value of the cromo - electric charge @xmath22 through @xmath23 finally , the yang - mills field tensor is defined as usual by @xmath24.\\ ] ]    the first term in the action ( i.e. , the yang - mills one ) is invariant under area - preserving diffeomorphisms .",
    "the second one is invariant against arbitrary diffeomorphisms @xcite .",
    "hence , the whole action is invariant under area - preserving diffeomorphisms .",
    "also , it is invariant under gauge transformations @xmath25    in can be seen that the interaction term of the action ( [ 2.1a ] ) may be put in the form @xmath26+\\int d^{2}x \\delta^{(2)}(x - z_{i}(\\tau ) ) tr[i_{i}(\\tau)a_{\\mu}\\left(z_{i}(\\tau)\\right)]\\right),\\ ] ] hence , varying the action ( [ 2.1a ] ) with respect to the dynamical variable @xmath27 we obtain @xmath28 where we have set @xmath29 .    to write down the equations of motion for the internal variables @xmath15 we follow the procedure given in @xcite .",
    "take a parametrization of the group elements @xmath30 and perform variations of @xmath31 with respect to the @xmath8 independent parameters @xmath32 .",
    "this leads us to the euler - lagrange equations @xmath33 where we have defined @xmath34    it can be seen that equations ( [ euler lagrange ] ) are equivalent to the gauge - covariant conservation of the non - abelian charge of each particle along its world line@xcite ( this conservation - law arises by taking the covariant derivative on both sides of equation ( [ 2.6a ] ) ) @xmath35=0 , \\label{conservacion}\\ ] ] whose solution is @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the time ordered exponential of the gauge field along the curve @xmath17 @xmath38 from ( [ 2.1d ] ) and ( [ solucion i ] ) we obtain @xmath39 , which in turn implies @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , we find that the interaction term @xmath31 of the action vanishes when it is evaluated on - shell .",
    "hence , we only have to consider the yang - mills action evaluated on the equations of motion .    plugging ( [ solucion i ] ) and ( [ tiempo ord ] ) into ( [ 2.6a ] ) yields an equation for the gauge potentials in terms of the curves @xmath17 @xcite . inserting the solution to this equation into the action ( [ 2.1a ] )",
    "one would finally obtain a functional @xmath41;\\lambda)$ ] that only depends on the curves @xmath42 and the coupling constant @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "following the general arguments discussed in the introduction , this on - shell action should retain the invariance under area - preserving diffeomorphisms .",
    "henceforth , the final expression for @xmath41;\\lambda)$ ] , calculated as explained above , constitutes an invariant under area - preserving diffeomorphisms associated to the curves @xmath17 .",
    "since the equations to be solved are non - linear , we will use a perturbative method to deal with them , such as in reference @xcite .",
    "at last , it will result that the action on - shell may be written as a power series in the parameter @xmath43 @xmath44,\\lambda)= \\frac{\\lambda}{2 } \\sum_{p=0}^{\\infty}\\lambda^p\\,\\ , s^{(p)}[\\gamma_i ] .",

    "we need to develop the ordered exponential in the right hand side of ( [ 2.6a ] ) : @xmath48 also , we expand the `` new '' fields @xmath49 in powers of @xmath43 , @xmath50 and introduce them into ( [ 2.10a ] ) to obtain the right hand of ( [ 2.6a ] ) order by order",

    "it is worth noticing that the general structure of the @xmath65-order equation of motion is , indeed , the same as that of the first two ones : the laplacian of the @xmath65-order potential @xmath66 is given in terms of previous orders potentials , which were already solved as functions of the curves @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , the perturbative method can be recursively applied , and the on - shell action can be obtained order by order .    turning back to the first contributions , we see that it remains to solve the @xmath58 and first orders equations ( [ 2.15a ] ) and ( [ 2.16a ] ) , and to substitute these results into ( [ 2.14b ] ) and ( [ 2.17a ] ) . to this end",
    ", we find it convenient to introduce loop - coordinates @xcite @xmath67 that obey the differential constraints @xmath68 where both @xmath69 and @xmath70 are taken as the origin of the loop .",
    "loop - coordinates also obey the algebraic constraints @xmath71 the sum in the right hand side of the last equation is made over all the permutations of the indices @xmath72 that preserve the order on the subset @xmath73 and on the remaining subset @xmath74 .",

    "can be written down as @xmath80 and @xmath81 while the @xmath58 and @xmath82 order currents are given by @xmath83 in turn , equations ( [ 2.15a ] ) and ( [ 2.16a ] ) for the zero and first orders can be written as @xmath84 and @xmath85 the solution of ( [ 2.10 ] ) is given by @xmath86 in this equation , @xmath87 is the green function of the laplacian : @xmath88 .    substituting ( [ 2.11 ] ) in ( [ 2.7d ] ) we obtain the area - invariant corresponding to the @xmath58 order @xmath89 \\left(t_{i}^{\\mu x}\\,\\ln|x - y|\\,t_{j}^{\\mu y}\\right)\\equiv 2\\sum_{i , j}[\\vec{i}_{i}\\cdot\\vec{i}_{j}]\\ ; j(\\gamma_{i},\\gamma_{j}),\\ ] ] where we have defined the quantity @xmath90 .",
    "it is worth noticing that this expression also corresponds to the result that we would obtain if we had considered the maxwell theory coupled with abelian particles . in section [ sec3 ] we shall interpret the meaning of this invariant .",
    "introducing ( [ 2.11 ] ) and ( [ 2.9 ] ) into ( [ 2.8 ] ) we can also obtain the first order yang - mills on - shell action in terms of the curves @xmath17 .",

    "since the isovectors @xmath93 are arbitrary we conclude , from ( [ 2.11d ] ) , that the quantities @xmath94 must be area invariants . in order to interpret them we introduce the @xmath95-form @xmath96 with support on the @xmath97-dimensional surface @xmath98 bounded by @xmath42 .",
    "it can be readily seen that @xmath99 substituting the loop coordinates @xmath100 in ( [ 3.1 ] ) with the help of the previous expression we obtain @xmath101    expression ( [ 3.5 ] ) measures the common area of the surfaces @xmath18 and @xmath102 bounded by the closed curves @xmath17 and @xmath103 respectively . clearly , this quantity is invariant under area - preserving diffeomorphisms , as expected .",
    "it is interesting to notice that @xmath90 is formally analogous to the gauss linking number of two curves in @xmath104 @xcite , which is just the @xmath58 order link invariant obtained when the perturbative procedure discussed here is applied to the classical chern - simons theory @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the `` trick '' of substituting the loop coordinate @xmath100 using ( [ 3.3 ] ) and integrating by parts does not suffice to yield a geometric interpretation of the first order area - invariant ( [ 2.12 ] ) , since it is not possible to get rid of the logarithm functions that appear in the expression for that invariant .",
    "later , in subsection [ c ] , we shall present a different method that provides a geometric interpretation of the first order invariant , and hopefully of the higher order ones too . before",
    ", we study the consistence of the @xmath58 and first orders equations of motion , since that method relies on the existence of their solutions .",
    "the consistency of the @xmath58 order equation of motion ( [ 2.10 ] ) is immediate : taking the divergence of both sides of the equation , and using our gauge condition , we obtain @xmath105 since we are taking the trajectories of the wong particles as closed curves .",
    "regarding the first order equation ( [ 2.16a ] ) , we rewrite it as @xmath106 taking the divergence on both sides of ( [ 2.14 ] ) and using the gauge condition we obtain @xmath107 using expressions ( [ 2.9 ] ) , ( [ 2.10 ] ) and ( [ 2.11 ] ) for @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 respectively , and taking into account the differential constraint ( [ 2.6 ] ) we have , after some calculations @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the starting point of the curve @xmath17 .",
    "if the curves do not intersect each other , and their iso - vectors @xmath113 are independent , equation ( [ 2.16 ] ) leads to the condition @xmath114 for every @xmath115 .",
    "hence , the first order equation of motion is consistent , and consequently the first order contribution to the action is meaningful ( for arbitrary values of the iso - vectors @xmath113 ) just when the @xmath58 order invariant @xmath90 vanishes for every @xmath115 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that this result resembles what occurs in the study of link invariants in @xmath104 through this method @xcite : the next order invariant is meaningful whenever the preceding one vanishes . in turn",
    ", this coincides with what happens with the milnor link invariants @xcite , which suggests that the chain of area invariants that one would obtain following this method could be seen as a kind of  projection \" of the milnor invariants , from links in @xmath104 and diffeomorphisms , to surfaces in @xmath116 and area preserving diffeomorphisms .",
    "let us assign a straight line to every point @xmath117 of space . for definiteness ,",
    "take these lines starting at the spatial infinity , running parallel to the vertical direction from bottom to top until each one reaches its associated point @xmath117 .",
    "the line associated to @xmath117 is denoted by @xmath118 .",
    "the one - index loop - coordinate @xmath119 of @xmath120 is @xmath121    from the very structure of the perturbative equations of motion ( see comment after equation ( [ 2.16a ] ) ) @xmath122 , and the lorentz gauge @xmath123 , it is clear that the green function @xmath87 enters in the solution of these equations only through its gradient @xmath124 .",
    "now , it is easy to see that the substitution @xmath125 induces an abelian gauge transformation on the potential @xmath126 @xmath127 where @xmath128 is a certain function depending on the bundle of curves @xmath129 .",
    "moreover , it can be shown that if @xmath130 is a vector in the direction of @xmath129 , @xmath131 .",
    "hence , the replacement ( [ 3.6a ] ) amounts to changing from lorentz to axial gauge [ actually , since space is euclidean , lorentz and coulomb gauges are identical , as well as axial and temporal gauges ] .",
    "finally , it can be shown that ( at least ) the @xmath58 and first order contributions to the action on shell are invariant under abelian gauge transformations , provided that their respective equations of motion are consistent .",
    "thus we arrive to the following result .",
    "although the calculations are done in the lorentz gauge , we are allowed to perform an abelian gauge transformation whenever the consistence conditions holds ( it seems that this result holds to every order , but we do not have a proof yet ) . changing to the axial gauge will allow us to interpret the @xmath58 and first order invariants .",
    "let us begin with the former .      now , observe that the integration in @xmath117 must be restricted to the area surrounded by curve @xmath19 , due to the factor @xmath133 in the integrand . furthermore , for each @xmath117 , the presence of the factor @xmath134 ensures that there will be contributions only when this point @xmath117 is connected through a vertical line with a point @xmath135 lying in the other curve @xmath136 , in such a manner that the infinitesimal displacements along the vertical path ( @xmath137 ) and along the closed curve @xmath136 ( @xmath138 ) form a non - degenerated parallelogram ( see fig . [ f1 ] ) . under these conditions ,",
    "the contribution associated to the point @xmath117 is just the area of that infinitesimal parallelogram : @xmath139 .    on the other hand , for each @xmath117 belonging to @xmath18 , but not to the intersection ( see @xmath140 in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) , there would be two contributions ( more generally , an even number of them , which could be none as in the case of @xmath141 , shown in fig . [ f1 ] ) because the parallel curves intersect twice the closed trajectory @xmath136 .",
    "but in these cases , the net contribution of the  upper side \" of curve @xmath136 ( i.e. the piece from @xmath142 to @xmath143 in clockwise sense ) plus the `` down side '' ( the part from @xmath143 to @xmath142 in counterclockwise sense ) cancel each other .      [ [ interpretation - of - the-1-st - order - invariant - s1-and - final - remarks . ] ] interpretation of the @xmath82 order invariant @xmath79 and final remarks . ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    our starting point will be expression ( [ 2.12 ] ) for the yang - mills action on - shell up to first order , expressed entirely in terms of the closed curves .",
    "since the coefficient related to the iso - vectors @xmath93 is completely antisymmetric in @xmath144 , and these iso - vectors are arbitrary , we conclude that the following quantity is invariant : @xmath145}^{\\nu y}\\ln|x - x_{1}|\\ln|x - x_{2}|\\partial_{\\mu}\\ln|x - y|   \\nonumber\\right.\\\\&&\\left . - t_{[i}^{\\nu x\\,\\mu y}t_{j}^{\\mu x_{1}}t_{k]}^{\\nu x_{2}}\\ln|y - x_{1}|\\ln|x - x_{2}|\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , square brackets denote anti - symmetrization .",
    "consider the first term in ( [ 3.8 ] ) .",
    "making the substitution ( [ 3.3 ] ) , and after some calculations it results @xmath146 making the substitution ( [ 3.6a ] ) , i.e. , changing to axial gauge , the last line of ( [ 3.9 ] ) can be written down as @xmath147 this quantity vanishes , because the straight lines @xmath118 are parallel , which implies that the cross product of their tangent vectors is zero .",
    "it remains to compute the second term in ( [ 3.8 ] ) .",
    "changing to the axial gauge by means of substitution ( [ 3.6a ] ) , we obtain @xmath148,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath149 $ ] means that the whole expression must be anti - symmetrized in the indices inside the bracket .",
    "this symmetry property of ( [ 3.11 ] ) imply that the minimal number of curves that will produce a non - trivial result is three .    to interpret this expression ,",
    "let us then consider a configuration of three curves as in fig .",
    "this configuration was chosen taking into account that , as we already know , @xmath150 is meaningful whenever ( [ 3.1 ] ) vanishes for every pair of curves . in this configuration , the absolute values of the areas of intersection @xmath151 , @xmath152 are the same , but their signs are such that the above condition is fulfilled .",
    "it should be noticed that , given the configuration of fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , only the first term in ( [ 3.11 ] ) contributes .",
    "the points @xmath153 and @xmath154 must belong to the surfaces @xmath102 and @xmath155 respectively , as indicated by the surface - functions @xmath156 and @xmath157 . also , we have now two bundles of open straight parallel lines : the `` fibers '' of one of them ( that corresponding to @xmath158 ) start at the points @xmath135 of @xmath17 , and end at the points @xmath153 of the surface surrounded by @xmath103 . the other bundle of parallel lines ( corresponding to @xmath159 ) also begins at @xmath17 , but finishes at @xmath154 inside @xmath155 . as before ,",
    "the contributions to expression ( [ 3.11 ] ) are expressed as areas of the infinitesimal parallelograms formed by vertical displacements along both the fiber and the curve where the corresponding fiber ends .    up to this point",
    ", there is nothing specially new in the discussion of the first - order invariant .",
    "the main difference with the previous case , is due to the presence of the loop coordinate with two indices @xmath160 , which introduces an _ intrinsic _ order in curve @xmath19 that affects which contributions must be summed up . in the integration along curve",
    "@xmath19 the areas of the parallelograms coming from curve @xmath161 , which have to be multiplied by those coming from curve @xmath136 , contribute only if the former are `` created '' before the later when one travels along curve @xmath19 starting at an arbitrary marked point ( @xmath162 , in fig.[f2 ] ) .",
    "henceforth , of the four products of areas @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 , that would appear if instead of @xmath167 we had @xmath168 times @xmath169 in ( [ 3.11 ] ) , the last one does not contribute due to the fact that @xmath170 is  drawn \" after @xmath171 was .",
    "then , the result of applying ( [ 3.11 ] ) to the picture in fig . [ f2 ] is minus the square of the area @xmath172 of any of the lobules of intersection .",
    "clearly , this is an area - preserving diffeomorphism invariant , which could not be detected by the previous order one ( which in fact vanishes ) .",
    "summarizing , we have shown that classical @xmath2 yang - mills theory coupled to non - dynamical wong particles in euclidean space can be used to obtain area - invariants through a perturbative scheme .",
    "this fact may be seen as an instance of a general result established in @xcite , which in turn aroused as a formalization of previous results @xcite .",
