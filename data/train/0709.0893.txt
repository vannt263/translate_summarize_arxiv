    "the statistical properties of fully developed , homogeneous , isotropic turbulence are often characterised by velocity structure functions , which are averages of the differences of fluid velocities at two points separated by a distance @xmath0 ( a precise definition is given below ) .",
    "if @xmath0 lies in the _ inertial range _ of scales that lie between the large length scale @xmath1 , at which energy is pumped into a turbulent fluid , and the small dissipation scale @xmath2 , at which viscous dissipation becomes significant , these structure functions scale as a power of @xmath0 , in a manner that is reminiscent of the algebraic behaviour of correlation functions at a critical point in , say , a spin system .",
    "this similarity between the statistical properties of homogeneous , isotropic turbulence and a system at a critical point is well known ; and its elucidation for _ equal - time _ structure functions has been the subject of many papers : it turns out that the simple scaling we are accustomed to at most critical points must be generalised to multiscaling in turbulence ; i.e. , an infinity of exponents is required to characterise the inertial - range behaviours of structure functions of different orders  @xcite .",
    "the scaling behaviour of correlation functions at a critical point  @xcite is associated with the divergence of a correlation length @xmath3 at the critical point ; e.g. , in a spin system @xmath4 if the field @xmath5 , where the reduced temperature @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the temperature , @xmath8 the critical temperature , and @xmath9 is an equal - time critical exponent that is universal ( for systems in a given universality class ) . in the vicinity of a critical point the relaxation time @xmath10 , which can be determined from _ time - dependent _ correlation functions , scales as follows : @xmath11 this is known as the _ dynamic - scaling ansatz _ via which we define @xmath12 , the dynamic - scaling exponent . over the past few years",
    "there has been considerable progress  @xcite in developing the analogue of such a dynamic - scaling _ ansatz _ for _ time - dependent _ structure functions in homogeneous , isotropic turbulence .",
    "we give an overview of this work on _ dynamic mutiscaling _ in turbulence .",
    "we show , in particular , that ( a ) an infinity of dynamic - multiscaling exponents is required here , ( b ) these exponents depend on the precise way in which relaxation times are extracted from time - dependent structure functions , and ( c ) that dynamic - multiscaling exponents are related by _ linear bridge relations _ to equal - time multiscaling exponents .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is organised as follows : section 2 contains an introduction to the multiscaling of equal - time structure functions in fluid turbulence .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the dynamic multiscaling of time - dependent structure functions . in sect .",
    "4 we introduce the goy shell model  @xcite for fluid turbulence and give the details of our numerical studies of this model . section 5 gives representative results from our simulations for time - dependent structure functions for the goy shell model with conventional viscosity ; we also present new results with hyperviscosity and show explicitly that dynamic multiscaling exponents are independent of the type of viscosity we use .",
    "we end with concluding remarks about the possibility of experimental verifications of our predictions and generalizations to other types of turbulence such as passive - scalar turbulence@xcite .",
    "fluid flows are described by the navier - stokes equation for the velocity field @xmath13 at point @xmath14 and time @xmath15 : @xmath16 we consider low - mach number flows that are nearly incompressible and so equation ( [ ns1 ] ) must be augmented by the incompressibility constraint @xmath17 which can be used to eliminate the pressure @xmath18 in equation ( [ ns1 ] ) ; we choose the uniform density @xmath19 ; @xmath20 is the kinematic viscosity ; and for decaying turbulence the external force @xmath21 is zero .",
    "turbulence occurs when the reynolds number @xmath22 is large ; here @xmath23 and @xmath24 are characteristic length and velocity scales of the flow .",
    "the chaotic nature of turbulence has led to a natural statistical description of the velocity field in terms of velocity structure functions .",
    "for instance , we can define the order-@xmath25 , equal - time , structure function for longitudinal velocity increments @xmath26.{\\bf r}/r$ ] as follows : @xmath27^p \\ra \\sim r^{\\zeta_p } ; \\label{sp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the power - law dependence on @xmath0 , which defines the exponent @xmath28 , holds for @xmath29 ; and the angular brackets indicate an average over either the statistical steady state , for forced turbulence , or statistically independent initial conditions , for decaying turbulence .",
    "in contrast with the scaling behaviour of correlation functions at conventional critical points in equilibrium statistical mechanics , in turbulence the structure functions @xmath30 do not exhibit simple scaling forms : experimental and numerical evidence suggests that @xmath30 show multiscaling , with @xmath28 a nonlinear , convex , monotone increasing function of @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "the 1941 theory of kolmogorov ( k41 )  @xcite yields simple scaling with @xmath31 ; the measured values of @xmath28 deviate significantly from @xmath32 for @xmath33 ; and for @xmath34 we have the exact von krmn - howarth  @xcite result @xmath35 .    even though the k41 phenomenology fails to capture the multiscaling of the equal - time structure function @xmath30 , it provides us with important conceptual underpinnings for studies of homogeneous , isotropic turbulence .",
    "in particular , the exponents @xmath32 are _ universal _ in the sense that they do not depend on the details of the dissipation , i.e. , the viscosity .",
    "( of course measurements should be made far away from boundaries so that the flow satisfies the conditions of homogeneity and isotropy . )",
    "this suggestion of power - law scaling with universal scaling exponents was made for turbulence a few decades before it was appreciated fully in the context of critical phenomena .",
    "the universality of the exponents @xmath28 holds even if we go beyond k41 phenomenology .",
    "let us first examine the dependence of these exponents on the dissipation mechanism .",
    "in numerical simulations it is possible to introduce a hyperviscosity @xmath36 by replacing the viscous term @xmath37 in equation ( [ ns1 ] ) by @xmath38 ; here @xmath39 determines the _ degree _ of hyperviscosity ; and @xmath40 yields normal viscous dissipation .",
    "some early shell - model studies  @xcite suggested that the exponents @xmath28 depend on @xmath41 .",
    "but subsequent direct numerical simulations ( dns )  @xcite of equations ( [ ns1]-[ns2 ] ) and numerical studies of a shell model  @xcite for turbulence have argued against this .",
    "our results are consistent with these later studies .",
    "the exponents @xmath28 do not seem to depend on whether they are measured in statistically steady , forced turbulence or in decaying turbulence .",
    "numerical evidence for this _ universality _ has been provided by the shell - model studies of ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "in the remaining sections of this paper we will show how to generalise the dynamic - scaling _ ansatz _ ( [ ds ] ) to account for multiscaling in turbulence .",
    "our discussion will be based on earlier studies  @xcite and the work carried out in our group  @xcite .",
    "we will then examine the universality of the dynamic - multiscaling exponents in fluid turbulence , i.e. , we will explore their dependence on ( a ) the hyperviscosity parameter @xmath41 and ( b ) the type of turbulence ( statistically steady as opposed to decaying ) .",
    "the dynamic scaling of time - dependent correlation functions at a critical point in an equilibrium system was systematised soon after the scaling of equal - time correlation functions . the analogous development for homogeneous ,",
    "isotropic turbulence has been carried out recently  @xcite .",
    "we summarise the essential points here before presenting our new results . a nave extension of k41 phenomenology to time - dependent structure functions",
    "yields a dynamic exponent @xmath42 for all orders @xmath25 .",
    "two improvements are required to go beyond this k41 result : ( a ) we must account for the multiscaling of velocity structure functions .",
    "( b ) we must distinguish between structure functions of eulerian and lagrangian velocities ; the former yield trivial dynamic scaling with @xmath43 , for all @xmath25 , since the mean flow ( or the flow of the largest eddy ) directly advects small eddies and so temporal and spatial separations are related linearly by the mean flow velocity ; nontrivial dynamic multiscaling can be anticipated , therefore , only for lagrangian  @xcite or quasi - lagrangian  @xcite velocity structure functions . the latter",

    "these bridge relations follow from a generalisation  @xcite of the multifractal formalism  @xcite for turbulence . here",
    "we sketch the arguments that lead to equation ( [ zipm ] ) for statistically steady turbulence and refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite for details : we begin by assuming the following multifractal form for the order-@xmath25 time - dependent structure functions : @xmath63 as in the equal - time multifractal formalism  @xcite , the scaling exponents @xmath64 $ ] . corresponding to each exponent @xmath65 there is a set @xmath66 , of fractal dimension @xmath67 and with a measure @xmath68 , such that @xmath69 if @xmath70 , with @xmath71 is such that @xmath72 and that the characteristic decay time @xmath73",
    ". if we substitute for @xmath74 in equation ( [ zi ] ) , do the time integral first by a saddle - point method , we obtain the bridge relation ( [ zipm ] ) .",
    "similar calculations lead to ( [ zdpm ] ) .",
    "a complete discussion of such bridge relations , as well as similar relations for passive - scalar turbulence , can be found in refs .",
    "the last of these references also shows that the bridge relations are the same for decaying and statistically steady turbulence .",
    "given current computational resources , it has not been possible to verify the bridge relations ( [ zipm]-[zdpm ] ) by computing quasi - lagrangian velocities in a direct numerical simulation of the navier - stokes equation ( [ ns1]-[ns2 ] ) for an incompressible fluid .",
    "thus we must turn to numerical studies of simple shell models of turbulence that we describe in the next section .",
    "we have carried out extensive numerical simulations to obtain equal - time and dynamic multiscaling exponents for the goy shell model for fluid turbulence  @xcite .",
    "this shell model is defined on a logarithmically discretized fourier space labelled by scalar wave vectors @xmath75 that are associated with the shells @xmath76 .",

    "we use the standard value @xmath87 .",
    "the second term allows for hyperviscous dissipation with degree @xmath41 ( the case @xmath40 corresponds to conventional viscous dissipation ) ; @xmath88 is a large wavenumber whose inverse is comparable to the dissipation length scale ; we choose @xmath89 and @xmath40 or @xmath90 .",
    "since we concentrate on decaying turbulence here , the forcing term , required to drive the system into a statistically steady state , is absent .",
    "the logarithmic discretization of fourier space allows us to reach very high reynolds numbers in numerical simulations of the goy model even with @xmath91 .",
    "we use a slaved , second - order , adams - bashforth scheme  @xcite to integrate the goy - model equations with @xmath92 shells , and , in some representative cases , @xmath93 ( this requires a fifth - order scheme  @xcite ) , with the boundary conditions @xmath94 for @xmath95 and @xmath96 . in our simulations we use @xmath97 as the integration time step , and the viscosity @xmath98 for @xmath40 and @xmath99 for @xmath90 .",
    "the goy - model equations allow for direct interactions only between nearest- and next - nearest - neighbour shells .",
    "by contrast , in the fourier transform of the navier - stokes equation every fourier mode of the velocity is coupled to every other fourier mode directly .",
    "this direct sweeping , as it is called , leads to the trivial dynamic scaling of eulerian velocity structure functions ( sect .",
    "3 ) . since the goy model does not have direct sweeping in this sense , it is sometimes thought of as a highly simplified quasi - lagrangian version of the navier - stokes equation .",
