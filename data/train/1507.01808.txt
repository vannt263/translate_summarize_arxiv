    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the brightest explosions in the universe .",
    "they release energy up to @xmath2 , which is on the order of @xmath3 , in the form of gamma - rays within a few seconds . from the spectral features and light curves of their prompt and afterglow emission , they are considered to be produced in ultrarelativistic jets .",
    "although the picture of the central engine has not yet been established , several constraints are required from the observations .",
    "it should be able to launch ultrarelativistic jets , meaning that relativistic objects should be involved .",
    "it should have two different characteristic timescales : the variability timescale of their prompt emission ( @xmath4 , e.g. , @xcite ) and the duration timescale of the prompt emission ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the latter timescale is much longer than the dynamical timescale of relativistic objects , but there is a way to explain all the requirements . the most promising model of the grb central engine is a hyperaccretion flow @xcite . in this model",
    "an ultrarelativistic jet would be launched from a massive accretion disk around a stellar - mass black hole whose mass accretion rate is at most @xmath6 .",
    "such a system is expected to form after a cataclysmic event such as the gravitational collapse of a massive star or the merger of a neutron star - neutron star binary or a black hole - neutron star binary @xcite .",
    "since such an accretion flow is extremely optically thick with respect to photons , it can not cool via electromagnetic radiation . instead ,",
    "since the density and temperature of this accretion flow are very high ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , it would cool via neutrinos , and such an accretion flow is often called as `` neutrino - dominated accretion flows '' ( ndaf ; @xcite ; see also section 10.6 of @xcite ) . in this model , the variability timescale can be interpreted as the dynamical ( i.e. , rotation ) timescale of an accretion disk , while the burst duration timescale corresponds to the accretion timescale . as for how a hyperaccretion flow can produce an ultrarelativistic jet , two physical processes",
    "are mainly discussed in the literature : neutrino pair annihilation ( @xmath9 ; @xcite ) and magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) mechanisms such as the blandford - znajek ( bz ) process ( @xcite ) .    in either scenario , it is implied that the energy deposition rate ( corresponding to the jet luminosity ) as a function of mass accretion rate has a step - function - like behavior at a certain critical mass accretion rate .",
    "according to the neutrino pair annihilation scenario , in fact , we expect a big jump in the neutrino emission efficiency across the critical accretion rate , @xmath10 for fiducial parameters ( see @xcite ) .",
    "that is , when the mass accretion rate is above @xmath11 the accretion flow becomes an efficient neutrino emitter ( `` ndaf '' regime ) and the energy deposition via neutrino annihilation is efficient , while when @xmath1 is below @xmath11 the accretion flow is in the `` advection - dominated '' ( adaf ) regime and neutrino pair annihilation emission is not at all efficient . similar behavior is expected in the mhd scenario , as well .",
    "@xcite investigated the mhd jet luminosity predicted from a hyperaccretion flow and found that it shows step - function - like behavior at @xmath12 . in either case , therefore , one can expect a drastic change of jet luminosity from a hyperaccretion flow when its mass accretion rate attains the critical value @xmath13 .",
    "if there is any physical mechanism which can modulate the mass accretion rate around @xmath11 , the jet luminosity would change violently , which may explain to the highly variable grb emission . theoretically , several types of disk instabilities are known @xcite , and the large - amplitude luminosity variations of accreting systems , such as those observed in dwarf novae and x - ray binaries are often ascribed to the accretion disk instabilities ( e.g. , @xcite , see a concise review by @xcite chapter 5 and 10 ) .",
    "however , little was known about the disk instabilities of a hyperaccretion flow , especially that with mass accretion rate around @xmath11 .",
    "recently , @xcite found that the thermal equilibrium curve at the innermost region of a hyperaccretion flow on the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane has the structure like a character `` n '' , which has a negative slope at @xmath12 .",
    "this means the existence of a secular ( or viscous ) instability of the accretion flow .    in our study , we for the first time solve the time evolution of the unstable hyperaccretion flow and show that the luminosity evolution occurs intermittently as a consequence of a local transition which takes place in a narrow region .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in section 2 , we describe the equations for disk evolution and the modeled n - shaped thermal equilibrium curve . in section 3",
    "we show the results of our calculations with an emphasis on the consequence of the instability .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the discussion on the dependence on the n - curve , the observable behavior , the comparison with the case of s - shaped curve , and future issues .",
    "in the present study , we solve the height - averaged basic equations for viscous diffusion of an axisymmetric accretion disk ( see , e.g. , @xcite chapter 3 ) :    @xmath14    and @xmath15 = -2\\pi \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r } \\left(r^{3 } \\nu \\sigma \\frac{d\\omega}{dr } \\right ) .",

    "note that each curve in figure 3(a ) except for the lowest one is vertically offset by the value depending on the elapsed time .    in these plots",
    "the mass accretion rates are taken to be the same everywhere by the assumption that every portion of the disk can immediately adjust to any changes in @xmath75 given at the outer boundary .",

    "we can see in figures 2(a ) and 3(a ) that the surface density rapidly increases at the radius where an upward transition occurs .",
    "after the transition , neutrino cooling is efficient .",
    "hence , neutrino is emitted from the high-@xmath51 regions .",
    "the steady model is simple and easy to calculate , since it requires no numerical technique , however , there exist certainly limitations . for example , it should take time for the influence of varying mass injection rates to prevail over the disk plane , but such a time delay is totally neglected in the steady model .",
    "also an upward transition can not occur in an infinitesimal time but a transition is assumed to be instantaneous in the steady model .",

    "we notice that the time of an upward transition at a certain radius in the time - dependent model is delayed , compared with that at the same radius in the steady model .",
    "this feature can also be confirmed by comparing figures 3(a ) and ( b ) and is obviously the effect of the finite accretion timescale .",
    "we also find that the @xmath51 profile shows fluctuating patterns .",

    "we briefly discuss the observable features of the unstable hyperaccretion flows . the short - term variability of a hyperaccretion flow would be the origin of the highly variable prompt emissions of grbs because the variable energy deposition from an accretion flow would produce a spatially inhomogeneous outflow , and it would result in producing internal shocks , which give rise to the highly variable emission from shock - accelerated electrons .    according to our calculations",
    ", the neutrino luminosity shows abrupt changes with time during the transition of a hyperaccretion flow . in model 1 with slowly increasing mass injection , especially ,",
    "the step - function - like changes in the neutrino luminosity occur repeatedly .",
    "if we adopt the neutrino pair annihilation scenario as the energy deposition process from a hyperaccretion flow , we can expect the intermittent energy ejection from an accretion flow , which can result in the highly variable emission of grbs .",
    "as for model 3 , where the injection rate decreases with time , the mass accretion rate at the inner edge shows strong variability .",
    "this may be related to the short - term variation of the blandford - znajek jet luminosity since it is proportional to the magnetic energy density on the event horizon and is , hence , likely to be proportional to the mass accretion rate ( kawanaka et al .",
    "2013a ) .",
    "we wish to note that the behavior of the secular instability is not always controlled by the variation timescale of the mass injection rate , but that rapid variations can occur on a much shorter timescale , less than @xmath120 s [ see figure 7(b ) and equation ( [ t0 ] ) ] .",
    "we here need to distinguish two timescales : the timescale of variable mass injection rate ( which is roughly the viscous timescale at large radii ) and that of the fluctuations in the @xmath51 and @xmath55 values around the ignition point ( which is much shorter than the former ) .",
    "the variability timescale observed in grbs is the order of @xmath121 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the observed rapid variability of the grbs should be related to the latter process , and so we conclude that the variability timescale in our model can match the observations of grbs .",
    "it is well known that the outbursts of dwarf - novae , a subclass of cataclysmic variables , and probably x - ray nova eruptions are triggered by a disk instability caused by the partial ionization of hydrogen in the disk ( see , e.g. , kato et al .",
    "2008 , chapter 5 and references therein ) .",
    "this is the so - called dwarf - nova type instability ( or hydrogen ionization instability ) and is characterized by the s - shaped equilibrium curve .",
    "it can be easily shown that the middle branch is thermally and secularly unstable , while the other two branches are stable . under the circumstances relaxation oscillations between the bi - modal stable branches spontaneously occur , even if the mass injection rate does not vary in time .",
    "this is the most successful time - dependent theory of the viscous accretion disk .",
    "there are similarities and differences between the dwarf - nova type instability and the present case of hyperaccretion disk instability with the n - shaped equilibrium curve .",
    "the most prominent common feature is bi - modal nature of the equilibrium curve .",
    "there are three states for a given @xmath75 and the middle state being secularly unstable in the present case , while dwarf - nova type disks undergo bi - modal transitions , although only one state is found for a given @xmath75 .",
    "another common feature is global propagation of bi - modal transitions from the ignition point to its neighboring sites .",
    "a big distinction resides in the fact that the solution is only secularly unstable in the present case .",
    "this is a crucial point when discussing the global nature of the instability in the present case , since the thermal timescale is much shorter than the viscous timescale , on which a secular instability grows .",
    "we in fact find non - steady features not so much pronounced , judging from the fact that the transition is restricted in a narrow region and light curves exhibit small - amplitude fluctuations .",
    "this contrasts the case in the dwarf - nova type disks which undergoes coherent oscillation and produce large - amplitude luminosity variations .",
    "to summarize , the big distinction arises from the fact that the @xmath55 value can change with a large amplitude , thereby producing significant non - steady effects in a thermally unstable disk , while it can not in a thermally stable disk",
    ".      it might be important in this respect that we have employed one - dimensional formulation for the basic equations in the present study , assuming that the vertical structure of the disk can immediately respond to changes in @xmath51 .",
    "this is not precisely correct , since it takes about a sound crossing time over the disk height ( @xmath122 ) for the entire vertical structure to adjust to any changes in @xmath51 . in future work , we thus need two - dimensional simulations to see vertical propagation of the instability .",
    "further , discontinuous transitions in the neutrino light curve , which seems to depend on a finite mesh size , can be altered by considering the two - dimensional effects .",
    "this is because changes in the vertical structure take longer time than the propagation time of the instability in the radial direction over a distance of one mesh size .",
    "we naively expect that the region with the width of @xmath123 may simultaneously undergo the branch transition , if we properly consider the two - dimensional effects .    in order to solve the time evolution of a hyperaccretion disk strictly",
