    "averaging principles for stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) have been studied extensively , for example , in liu and vanden - eijnden @xcite , freidlin and wentzell @xcite , khasminskii @xcite , yin and zhang @xcite .",
    "recently , averaging principles for stochastic partial differential equations ( spdes ) have also drawn much attention ; see , for example , kuksin and piatnitski @xcite and maslowski _ et al .",
    "in particular , blmker _",
    "@xcite derived averaging results with explicit error bounds for spdes with quadratic nonlinearities , where the limiting system is an sde ; cerrai and freidlin @xcite investigated the weak convergence for two - time - scale stochastic reaction ",
    "diffusion equations with additive noise by using an approach based on kolmogorov equations and martingale solutions of stochastic equations ; cerrai @xcite generalized cerrai and freidlin @xcite to the case of slow  fast reaction ",
    "diffusion equations driven by multiplicative noise , where the reaction terms appear in both equations ; brhier @xcite gave the strong and weak orders in averaging for stochastic evolution equation of parabolic type with slow and fast time scales .",
    "for the finite - dimensional jump  diffusion case , we refer to givon @xcite .    in view of the development on the aforementioned singularly perturbed spdes ,",
    "the noise processes considered to date are mainly square integrable processes",
    ". however , such requirement rules out the interesting @xmath0-stable processes .",
    "it is well known that both wiener processes and poisson - jump processes have finite moments of any order , whereas an @xmath0-stable process only has finite @xmath2th moment for @xmath4 .",
    "stochastic equations driven by @xmath0-stable processes have proven to have numerous applications in physics because such processes can be used to model systems with heavy tails . as a result ,",
    "such processes have received increasing attentions recently .",
    "for example , priola and zabczyk @xcite gave a proper starting point on the investigation of structural properties of spdes driven by an additive cylindrical stable noise ; dong _ et al .",
    "@xcite studied ergodicity of stochastic burgers equations driven by @xmath5-subordinated cylindrical brownian motions with @xmath1 . for finite - dimensional sdes driven by @xmath0-stable noises , wang @xcite derived gradient estimate for linear sdes , zhang @xcite established the bismut ",
    "elworthy  li derivative formula for nonlinear sdes , and",
    "ouyang @xcite established harnack inequalities for ornstein  uhlenbeck processes by the sharp estimates of density function for rotationally invariant symmetric @xmath0-stable lvy processes .",
    "nevertheless , two - time - scale formulation for stochastic processes driven by @xmath0-stable processes have not yet been considered to date to the best of our knowledge .    motivated by the previous works , in this paper we develop averaging principles for two - time - scale spdes driven by @xmath0-stable noises that admit unique mild solutions .",
    "the time - scale separation is given by introducing a small parameter @xmath6 .",
    "for the case of mean - square integrable noise , the it formula plays an important role in the error analysis between the slow component and the averaging systems ; see , for example , givon @xcite , fu and duan @xcite and fu and liu @xcite .",
    "it has been noted that when the diffusion operators in fu and duan @xcite and fu and liu @xcite are hilbert ",
    "schmidt , the mild solution is indeed a strong solution . nevertheless , in our case , only",
    "_ mild it s formula _",
    "( see , e.g. , da prato _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , theorem  1 ) is available since the stochastic systems considered only admit mild solutions , not strong solutions .",
    "moreover , the technique adopted in brhier @xcite , lemma  3.1 , which is a key ingredient in discussing averaging principle , does not work for the case of spdes driven by @xmath0-stable noises either , although the mild solution is treated there . in our study ,",
    "in addition to the spdes , we assume that the systems are modulated by a continuous - time markov chain .",
    "this markov chain has a finite state space resulting in a system of stochastic differential equations switching back and forth according to the state of the markov chain .",
    "the markov chain can be used to model discrete events that are not representable otherwise .",
    "it is by now widely recognized that such regime - switching formulation is an effective way of modeling many practical situations in which random environment and other random factors have to be taken into consideration .",
    "perhaps , one of the first efforts in modeling random environment using a finite - state markov chain can be traced back to griego and hersh @xcite ( see also the extended survey in hersh @xcite , where multiple time scale was also used ) .",
    "much of the recent modeling and analysis effort stems from the work of hamilton and susmel @xcite , who revealed the feature of the so - called regime - switching systems under which the dynamics of the systems can be quite different under different regimes .",
    "their idea stimulated much of the subsequent study .",
    "for example , in the simplest setting , the successfully used regime - switching models in financial market portraits the random environment with two states bull and bear markets , whose volatilities are drastically different .",
    "our study is divided into two parts . in the first part",
    ", we assume that the switching process is subject to fast variation , either within a weakly irreducible class or within a number of nearly decomposable weakly irreducible classes ( see yin and zhang @xcite , chapter  4 ) .",
    "the idea is that the original system subject to fast switching is more complex , but the limit system is much simpler . for many applications",
    ", it will be desirable to find the structure of the limit system leading substantial reduction of computational complexity for such tasks as control and optimization etc .",
    "we show that under suitable conditions , a limit process that is a solution of either an spde or an spde with switching is obtained .",
    "the key is that in the limit , the coefficients are averaged out with respect to the stationary measure of the switching processes . in the second part",
    ", we assume that there is an additional fast - varying random process .",
    "although the process is fast varying , it does not blow up , but rather has an invariant measure .",
    "the ergodicity of the fast process helps us to get a limit process that is a solution of the spdes with the coefficients being averaged out with respect to the stationary distribution of the fast - varying process .",
    "to summarize , there are several distinct difficulties in our problems .",
    "first , the noise is not square integrable .",
    "second , the underlying spde admits only a unique mild solution and as a result , there is only mild it s formula that can be used .",
    "moreover , another new aspect is the addition of the fast regime switching and the addition of the fast varying jump processes in the formulation , which enlarges the applicability of the underlying systems . to overcome these difficulties , using the mild solutions ,",
    "a semigroup approach is taken . under suitable conditions",
    ", it is proved that the @xmath2th moment convergence takes place with @xmath3 , which is stronger than the usual weak convergence approaches .",
    "we thus term such a convergence as strong convergence .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec:2-sw ] ,",
    "we obtain not only averaging principles for spdes with two - time - scale markov switching with a single weakly recurrent class but also for the case of two - time - scale markov switching with multiple weakly irreducible classes . in section  [ fast - jump ] , we demonstrate the strong convergence for spdes with an additional fast - varying random process driven by cylindrical stable processes .",
    "we first recall some basics on stable processes .",
    "a real - valued random variable @xmath7 is said to have a stable distribution with stability index @xmath8 , scale parameter @xmath9 , skewness parameter @xmath10 $ ] , and location parameter @xmath11 , if its characteristic function has the form : @xmath12 where @xmath13 for @xmath14 and @xmath15 for @xmath16 .",
    "note that the monograph samorodnitsky and taqqu @xcite , pages  210 , also gives three other equivalent definitions of a stable distribution .",
    "we denote the family of stable distributions by @xmath17 and write @xmath18 to indicate that @xmath19 has the stable distribution @xmath17 .",
    "a random variable @xmath20 is said to be strictly stable if @xmath21 for @xmath14 ( if @xmath22 for @xmath16 ) , symmetric if @xmath23 , and standard ( normalized ) if @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath25 be a real separable hilbert space .",
    "let @xmath26 and @xmath27 be a cylindrical @xmath0-stable process and @xmath28-stable process defined by the orthogonal expansion , respectively , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are sequences of i.i.d .",

    "hybrid systems driven by continuous - time markov chains have been used to model many practical scenarios in which abrupt changes may be experienced in the structure and parameters caused by phenomena such as component failures or repairs ; see sethi and zhang @xcite , remark  5.1 , page  94 , for discussions on the modeling of such a system and related optimal control problems . for finite - dimensional cases , there is extensive literature on such topic , for example , mao and yuan @xcite , mariton @xcite , yin and zhu @xcite and the references therein . as an infinite - dimensional example",
    ", we consider a one - dimensional rod of length @xmath46 whose ends are maintained at @xmath47 and whose sides are insulated .",
