    "we introduce a revised idea of the environment analyzer  @xcite and make an attempt to mathematically formalize a complex decision making process that people do choosing their path  while moving their strategies may vary : cooperate , coincide and compete depending on a current position and an environment ; i.e. , depending on a place and time .",
    "at first let us present a probability formula and later we are discussing it in details .",
