    "<S> the standard treatment of gravitational lensing by a point mass lens @xmath0 is based on a weak - field deflection angle @xmath1 , where @xmath2 with @xmath3 the distance of closest approach to the mass of a lensed light ray . </S>",

    "<S> this paper considers these issues analytically taking into account the relativistic images , under three assumptions * a1**a3 * , for a schwarzschild black hole lens with background point and extended sources having arbitrary surface brightness profiles . </S>",
    "<S> the assumptions are * a1 : * the source is close to the line of sight and lies in the asymptotically flat region outside the black hole lens ; * a2 : * the observer - lens and lens - source distances are significantly greater than the impact parameters of the lensed light rays ; and * a3 : * the distance of closest approach of any light ray that does not wind around the black hole on its travel from the source to the observer , lies in the weak - field regime outside the black hole . </S>",
    "<S> we apply our results to the galactic black hole for lensing scenarios where * a1**a3 * hold . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a single factor characterizes the full relativistic correction to the weak - field image centroid and magnification . as the lens - source distance increases , the relativistic correction factor strictly decreases . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find that for point and extended sources about @xmath5 behind the black hole , which is a distance significantly outside the tidal disruption radius of a sun - like source , the relativistic correction factor is minuscule , of order @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for standard lensing configurations , any detectable relativistic corrections to microlensing by the galactic black hole will most likely have to come from sources significantly closer to the black hole .    </S>",
