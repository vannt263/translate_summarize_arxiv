    "the spectral weight in the dynamic structure factor @xmath4 of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) @xmath0 heisenberg antiferromagnet @xmath5 at @xmath1 has long been known to come predominantly from the 2-spinon excitations,@xcite which form a continuum between the lower and upper boundaries ( with energies in units of @xmath6)@xcite @xmath7 however , the exact 2-spinon part of @xmath2 , here named @xmath8 , was determined only very recently,@xcite based on new advances in quantum groups.@xcite    the exact expression of @xmath8 , which had a fairly complex structure in its original form,@xcite was simplified considerably in ref .",
    ", evaluated numerically , and plotted versus @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the spectral - weight distribution was found to diverge at @xmath11 , @xmath12 and to vanish in a square - root cusp at @xmath13 , @xmath14 these singularities differ from those of the approximate expression @xmath15 for the 2-spinon dynamic structure factor , which had been inferred from finite-@xmath16 data , sum rules , and bethe - ansatz calculations.@xcite otherwise , the line shapes of @xmath8 and @xmath17 do not differ all that much.@xcite    the 2-spinon excitations were shown to account for 82.18% of the total intensity in @xmath2 .",
    "where in @xmath18-space is the remaining spectral weight , from which classes of bethe - ansatz solutions does it originate , and how does it affect various quantities that can be derived from the dynamic structure factor ?",
    "a study of the 4-spinon contribution to @xmath2 along the lines of refs . will shed light on the first two questions.@xcite in answer to the third question , we investigate here the effects of the non-2-spinon excitations on four quantities which are related to @xmath2 and which can be computed with high precision from finite-@xmath16 data for the ground - state wave function .",
    "the integrated intensity of @xmath2 , i.e. the static spin structure factor @xmath19 has been determined with high precision for wave numbers @xmath20 from finite-@xmath16 data of cyclic chains with @xmath21 sites.@xcite this result is plotted in fig .  1 for comparison with the exact 2-spinon integrated intensity @xmath22 calculated from @xmath8 via ( [ iq ] ) and the integrated intensity@xcite @xmath23 obtained from the approximate result @xmath17 .",
    "the finite-@xmath16 data indicate that @xmath24 increases linearly from zero for small @xmath9 and diverges logarithmically at @xmath25 .",
    "the initial rise of the finite-@xmath16 data , @xmath26,@xcite is significantly steeper than that of the 2-spinon contribution , @xmath27 and that of the approximate result , @xmath28 .",
    "hence the integrated intensity of the non-2-spinon part of @xmath2 increases linearly in @xmath9 too .",
    "the function @xmath29 approximates the 2-spinon integrated intensity @xmath22 quite well for @xmath30 . at larger @xmath9 ,",
    "this is no longer the case .",
    "the divergence predicted by expression ( [ ia ] ) , @xmath31 , is weaker than the divergence of the exact 2-spinon result , @xmath32^{3/2}$ ] .",
    "the inset of fig .  1 shows the relative non-2-spinon integrated intensity , @xmath33 , and the relative deviation , @xmath34 , of the approximate result ( [ ia ] ) .",
    "if it can be assumed that the leading singularity of @xmath24 at @xmath25 is produced entirely by the 2-spinon part of @xmath2 , then the function @xmath35 must approach zero as @xmath36 .",
    "the dashed line in the inset does not rule out that this assumption is correct .",
    "whether or not the 4-spinon excitations contribute to the leading singularity in @xmath24 remains to be seen.@xcite    it is interesting to compare these results with the exact integrated intensity of the haldane - shastry model,@xcite @xmath37 , where non-2-spinon excitations have zero spectral weight in @xmath2 .",
    "it turns out that for @xmath38 , @xmath39 is a much better approximation of @xmath24 than @xmath22 is.@xcite",
    "the @xmath9-dependent susceptibility at @xmath1 is related to @xmath2 via the sum rule@xcite @xmath40 this quantity , which has been determined with considerable accuracy from finite-@xmath16 data , is plotted in fig .  2 for comparison with the exact 2-spinon susceptibility @xmath41 calculated@xcite from @xmath8 via ( [ chiq ] ) and the approximate result@xcite @xmath42 inferred from ( [ ma ] ) .",
    "the normalization of @xmath17 was chosen such that the exact value of the direct susceptibilty,@xcite @xmath43 , is correctly reproduced . with increasing @xmath9",
    ", @xmath44 deviates in a downward direction from @xmath45 .",
    "its divergence at @xmath46 , is slightly weaker than that of the exact 2-spinon susceptibilty,@xcite @xmath47 , which , presumably coincides with the leading singularity of @xmath45 .",
    "the contribution of the non-2-spinon spectral weight of @xmath2 to @xmath45 in the limit @xmath48 is small but non - negligible as indicated by the result @xmath49 , which falls some 5% short of the exact direct susceptibilty .",
    "the relative non-2-spinon contribution to the susceptibility , @xmath50 , stays smaller for all @xmath9-values than the relative non-2-spinon integrated intensity @xmath51 ( see inset ) .",
    "this indicates that the non-2-spinon spectral weight is located predominatly above the 2-spinon continuum .",
    "yet a different way to assess the non-2-spinon part of @xmath2 employs the frequency moments @xmath52 which are related , via sum rules,@xcite to short - range multi - spin correlations in the ground state .",
    "for @xmath53 we know the exact results,@xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the ground - state energy .",
    "for @xmath56 high - precision results have been calculated from finite-@xmath16 data for the associated ground - state expectation values.@xcite the moments @xmath57 of the exact 2-spinon dynamic structure factor @xmath8 have been determined in ref .   and the moments @xmath58 of @xmath17 in ref .  .    for @xmath53 , both @xmath59 and @xmath60 reproduce the @xmath9-dependence of the exact sum rule ( [ k1q ] ) correctly , but the prefactors are smaller , @xmath61 which again reflects the missing spectral weight of the non-2-spinon excitations .",
    "the @xmath9-dependence of the moment ratios @xmath62 of the full dynamic structure factor as inferred from finite-@xmath16 data are shown in fig .  3 along with the corresponding moment ratios @xmath63 of @xmath8 and the moment ratios @xmath64 of @xmath17 .",
    "the most striking observation is that @xmath65 approaches a nonzero value as @xmath48 , whereas the exact and the approximate 2-spinon moment ratios both go to zero : @xmath66 .",
    "this means that for long wavelengths the frequency moments @xmath67 , are dominated by non-2-spinon excitations , which are necessarily located above the narrow 2-spinon band .",
    "in other words , the 2-spinon dynamic structure factor @xmath8 does not contribute to the leading @xmath68 term of @xmath69 for @xmath70 .    at larger wave numbers , the impact of the non-2-spinon excitations on the moment ratios is more modest but still significant . here",
    "the deviation of @xmath63 from @xmath65 is almost @xmath9-independent , and it grows with increasing @xmath71 .",
    "this again indicates that the non-2-spinon spectral weight comes for the most part from higher frequencies than the 2-spinon spectral weight .",
    "the moment ratios @xmath64 agree very well with @xmath63 at small @xmath9 , but then deviate upwardly . for @xmath72 , they rise even above the ratios @xmath65 . this discrepancy , which becomes more conspicuous with increasing @xmath71 , reflects the fact that @xmath17 underestimates the spectral weight near the lower continuum boundary @xmath11 and overestimates the spectral weight near the upper boundary @xmath13 .",
    "in order to study the significance of the non-2-spinon excitations in a dynamical quantity by the same kind of comparison , it is useful to consider the laplace transform of the dynamic structure factor,@xcite @xmath73 which can be interpreted as a euclidian time representation of @xmath2 . for @xmath74 ,",
    "this is the integrated intensity ( [ iq ] ) . from finite-@xmath16 data for @xmath2",
    "as obtained via recursion method for systems with @xmath21 sites,@xcite this quantity can be accurately extrapolated to @xmath75 if @xmath76 .",
    "for the graphical representation , it is convenient to plot the function @xmath77,\\ ] ] which was used for the finite-@xmath16 extrapolation , instead of @xmath78 itself .",
    "the resulting curves , shown as solid lines in fig .",
    "4 for several @xmath9-values , rise from zero with zero initial slope and then become almost linear in @xmath79 with a @xmath9-dependent slope .",
    "if the threshold singularity were a square - root divergence as predicted by ( [ ma ] ) , then the asymptotic growth of @xmath80 would be exactly linear .",
    "the logarithmic correction in the exact 2-spinon threshold singularity ( [ sqtowl ] ) , however , leads to a slight modification of the asymptotic growth of @xmath80 , @xmath81    the dashed lines in fig .  4",
    "show the function @xmath82 as inferred from the exact 2-spinon dynamic structure factor .",
    "the discrepancies are fairly small over the range of @xmath79 shown . the deviation @xmath83 is shown in the inset .",
    "not surprisingly , the function @xmath84 inferred from ( [ ma ] ) deviates more strongly from @xmath80 .",
