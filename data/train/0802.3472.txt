    "theoretical and computational physical chemists have long sought reliable and accurate means of performing quantum dynamics calculations for molecular systems , as quantum effects such as tunneling and interference often play an important role in such systems .",
    "if `` exact '' methods are required  i.e . , numerical techniques for which the error bars may ( in principle ) be reduced arbitrarily  the traditional approach has been to represent the system hamiltonian using a finite , direct - product basis set .",
    "however , this approach suffers from the drawback that the scaling of computational effort is necessarily exponential with system dimensionality.@xcite    recently , a number of promising new methods have emerged that may spell an end to exponential scaling  or at the very least , drastically reduce the exponent .",
    "the latter category includes various basis set optimization methods,@xcite which have nearly doubled the number of degrees of freedom ( dofs ) that may be tackled on present - day computers , from about 6 to 10 dofs .",
    "very recently , the first basis - set method to defeat exponential scaling ( at least in principle ) was introduced.@xcite this method , which uses wavelets in conjunction with a phase space truncation scheme , has been applied to model problems up to 15 dofs , and is easily extendible to higher dimensionalities  although some technical issues vis - a - vis applicability to real molecular systems must still be resolved .",
    "a completely different approach to the exact quantum dynamics problem may be found in time - dependent trajectory methods .",
    "although trajectory methods are extremely common in molecular dynamics applications , they are almost always classical , quasiclassical , or semiclassical@xcite  i.e . , not exact , in the sense described above .",
    "however , it is possible to perform exact quantum dynamical propagation using trajectory - based methods .",
    "these so - called `` quantum trajectory methods''@xcite ( qtms ) are based on the hydrodynamical picture of quantum mechanics , developed over half a century ago by bohm@xcite and takabayasi,@xcite using even earlier ideas of madelung@xcite and van vleck.@xcite    trajectory methods of all kinds are appealing , because they offer an intuitive , classical - like understanding of the underlying dynamics .",
    "qtms are especially appealing , however  not only because they ultimately yield exact results , but also because they offer a pedagogical understanding of quantum effects such as tunneling.@xcite curiously , qtms thus far have not fared so well as semiclassical methods , vis - a - vis their treatment of another fundamental quantum effect  interference .",
    "this issue is discussed in more detail below , as it is of central concern for the present paper .",
    "an in - depth comparison of interference phenomena is provided in an intriguing article by zhao and makri.@xcite garashchuk and rassolov@xcite discuss the interesting connection between qtm and semiclassical propagators,@xcite in the context of herman - kluk initial value representations.@xcite    perhaps the greatest attraction of qtms , however , has been the promise that they may be able to defeat exponential scaling . in any event ,",
    "qtms have undergone tremendous development since their introduction in 1999most notably within the last year or two .",
    "much of the early development centered around accurate evaluation of spatial derivatives of the wavefunction,@xcite but with the introduction of local least - squares fit adaptive and unstructured grid techniques,@xcite this difficulty is now essentially resolved .",
    "this has paved the way for a number of interesting applications of qtms , including barrier transmission,@xcite non - adiabatic dynamics,@xcite and mode relaxation.@xcite several intriguing phase space generalizations have also emerged,@xcite of particular relevance for dissipative systems.@xcite    on the other hand , qtms still suffer from one major drawback  they are numerically highly unstable in the vicinity of nodes .",
    "this `` node problem '' manifests in several different ways:@xcite ( 1 ) infinite forces , giving rise to kinky , erratic trajectories ; ( 2 ) compression / inflation of trajectories near wavefunction local extrema / nodes , leading to ; ( 3 ) insufficient sampling for accurate derivative evaluations . in the best case , this can result in substantially more trajectories and time steps than the corresponding classical calculation ; in the worst case , the calculation may fail altogether , beyond a certain point in time .    for many molecular applications ( though certainly not all )",
    ", the initial wavepacket is nodeless ; however , it may develop nodes at some later point in time .",
    "moreover , from a practical standpoint , nodes per se are not the only source of numerical difficulty ; in general , any large or rapid oscillations in the wavefunction  termed `` quasinodes''@xcite  can be sufficient to cause the problems described above . such oscillations are very easily formed in molecular systems , particularly during barrier reflection . accordingly",
    ", several numerical techniques are being developed to address the node problem , including the arbitrary lagrangian - eulerian frame method,@xcite and the artifical viscosity method.@xcite in this paper , we take a different approach to the node problem , based on a thorough understanding of the differences and similarities between bohmian and semiclassical mechanics .",
    "formally , these two theories share many similarities , as was known from the earliest days@xcite  yet in practical terms , semiclassical and quantum trajectories often behave very differently .",
    "for instance , the former may cross in position space , but not in phase space ; the latter do exactly the opposite . for the special case of stationary eigenstates in 1 dof ( the focus of the present paper ) , semiclassical trajectories evolve in phase space along the contours of the classical hamiltonian , whereas quantum trajectories _ do not move at all_. for well - behaved potentials , classical trajectories are always smooth and well - behaved , but quantum trajectories may be kinky and erratic .    as noted by zhao and makri,@xcite nowhere",
    "are the differences between the two methods more profound than in the treatment of nodes and interference phenomena  which is not even _ qualitatively _ similar . in the semiclassical treatment ,",
    "the approximate wavefunction is expressed in terms of simple functions that are generally as smooth and well - behaved as the potential itself .",
    "oscillations and nodes are obtained when different lobes or `` sheets '' of the semiclassical wavefunction come to occupy the same region of space  thus giving rise naturally to interference .",
    "in contrast , the bohmian representation of the wavefunction is single - valued , and therefore incapable of self - interference .",
    "consequently , all of the undesirable  even `` unphysical''aspects of quantum trajectories , as described in the previous paragraph , are necessary in order to represent nodes and quasinodes explicitly .    from a dynamical perspective",
    ", the only difference between semiclassical and quantum trajectories is the quantum potential , @xmath0 , and it is a remarkable fact that @xmath0 alone is responsible for all of the very fundamental differences described above . on the other hand",
    ", this situation is also cause for alarm , for @xmath0 turns out to be the order @xmath1 correction that is ignored in semiclassical treatments  being regarded as `` insignificant '' in the large action limit , in accord with the correspondence principle . from the previous discussion , it is clearly incorrect to regard @xmath0 as insignificant , which seems to place the semiclassical approximation  and indeed , the correspondence principle itself  in jeopardy .",
    "moreover , there are certain unappealing aspects of the semiclassical approach ",
    "multivaluedness , caustics , phase discontinuities , etc.@xcite  that simply do not arise in a bohmian treatment . on the other hand ,",
    "the semiclassical approximation is known to be valid in the large action limit  which together with the undesirable features of the bohmian approach as discussed in the previous paragraph , seems to call into question the physical correctness of the latter .",
    "this paradox has been a source of concern for some researchers , notably einstein.@xcite    the primary goal of the present paper is to reconcile the semiclassical and bohmian theories , in a manner that preserves the best features of both , and also satisfies the correspondence principle . at least within the context of stationary eigenstates in 1 dof",
    ", the above paradox turns out to be remarkably easy to resolve .",
    "it can be shown that the disturbing dissimilarities described above stem not from the theoretical methodologies themselves , but from the simple fact that each method uses a different ansatz to represent the wavefunction  thus giving rise to a rather unfair comparison .",
    "in particular , since the semiclassical functions are double - valued in the classically allowed region of space , the stationary wavefunction is represented as the sum of two terms  essentially a pair of `` traveling waves , '' headed in opposite directions . in contrast",
    ", the standard bohmian approach uses a single term to represent the wavefunction .",
    "virtually all of the disparities described above arise from this simple fact .",
    "it is therefore natural to consider what would happen if the bohmian formalism were applied to a _ two - term _ wavefunction  thus placing it on a proper par with the semiclassical method . as will be shown in this paper , this results in everything `` falling into place . '' in particular , the quantum potential  far from being singular in the vicinity of nodes  is well - behaved everywhere , and in fact , becomes vanishingly small in the large action limit , exactly in accord with the correspondence principle .",
    "the same can be said for the quantum trajectories , which are no longer stationary , and approach the corresponding semiclassical trajectories in the large action limit ( within the classically allowed region of space ) .",
    "this implies the somewhat counterintuitive result that quantum trajectories must be well - behaved when the number of nodes is _ large _ , for this signifies the large - action limit . in any event ,",
    "the two - term bohmian approach provides us with the `` best of both worlds , '' i.e. the well - behaved trajectories of semiclassical mechanics , together with the singlevaluedness and lack of caustics and phase discontinuities that characterize bohmian mechanics .",
    "more generally than for just the stationary states in 1 dof considered here , it is anticipated that a multi - term bohmian implementation will go a long way towards alleviating the node problem .",
    "let @xmath2 be any normalized wavefunction in the single dof , @xmath3 .",
    "being a complex function , @xmath2 can be decomposed into two real functions , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , representing the amplitude and phase , respectively , as follows : ( x ) = r_b(x ) e^i s_b(x)/ [ onelmb ] equation  ( [ onelmb ] ) is the celebrated madelung - bohm ansatz,@xcite which we term the `` unipolar ansatz,''@xcite as it consists of a single term only .",
    "the function @xmath6 has units and interpretation of action . if time evolution is considered , then @xmath6 plays the role of hamilton s principle function in classical mechanics,@xcite which therefore properly depends on @xmath7 as well as on @xmath3 .",
    "however , for stationary states in a time - independent context , @xmath6 is analogous to hamilton s characteristic function , @xmath8 , which is time - independent .",
    "both interpretations will be found to be important for the present approach .",
    "the above decomposition is essentially unique if @xmath4 is nonnegative throughout ; however , it leads to discontinuities in @xmath6 , and cusps in @xmath4 , if @xmath2 has nodes . despite these drawbacks ,",
    "is the decomposition generally utilized in standard bohmian treatments,@xcite thus motivating use of the `` @xmath9 '' subscript .",
    "it will be shown in this paper  evidently for the first time  that this convention in and of itself gives rise to certain node - related numerical difficulties that would otherwise not arise ( sec .  [ nodeissues ] ) .",
    "accordingly , for the present work , we presume amplitude functions that change sign when passing through nodes . to avoid confusion with the standard bohmian decomposition",
    ", we use unsubscripted quantities to represent the present unipolar ansatz decomposition , i.e. ( x ) = r(x ) e^i s(x)/ , [ onelm ] where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and the new decomposition functions , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , are smooth and continuous throughout the entire coordinate range ; for the latter reason , @xmath13 is deemed a better analog for hamilton s functions than is @xmath6 . in any event , throughout this work , when discussing the unipolar ansatz , we are referring to , unless explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "although the function @xmath13 is unique modulo @xmath14 , physically , it is well - defined only up to the addition of an arbitrary constant , which introduces an arbitrary but immaterial phase factor into @xmath2 .",
    "equation  ( [ onelm ] ) is the starting point of both quantum trajectory _ and _ semiclassical methods . presuming a quantum hamiltonian of the form = ^2 2 m + v ( ) , [ ham ] the general time evolution equations for the unipolar decomposition functions are where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , etc . , and",
    "the coordinate dependences have been suppressed to save space .",
    "equation  ( [ rdotuni ] ) is the continuity equation , essentially stating that probability is conserved .",
    "note that this equation is independent of the particular system potential , @xmath17 .",
    "equation  ( [ sdotuni ] ) is the quantum analog of the hamilton - jacobi equation,@xcite which does depend on the particular @xmath17 .",
    "it is in the treatment of this equation that the semiclassical and bohmian theories part company .",
    "the former ignores the first term in the square brackets , giving rise to the standard classical hamilton - jacobi equation .",
    "the latter regards the first term as the `` quantum potential , '' q(x ) = - ^2 2 m , [ qex ] which is added to the true potential , to form the modified potential , @xmath18 .",
    "apart from the substitution @xmath19 , the dynamical laws for the two approaches are identical .    in particular , in both cases ,",
    "the momentum @xmath20 is related to the action via p(x ) = s(x ) [ peeeq ] the set of points @xmath21 constitute a one - dimensional subspace of the 1 dof phase space known as a `` lagrangian manifold '' ( lm).@xcite this terminology is generally used in a classical or semiclassical context only ; however , we find it convenient to apply it in the exact quantum case as well .      if @xmath2 is presumed to be a stationary state ",
    ", an eigenstate of the hamiltonian , @xmath22 , with energy @xmath23then @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "the first result , together with , is consistent with the well - known property that for standing waves , the phase is constant over @xmath3 . without loss of generality , we may take @xmath2 to be real , so that @xmath26 and @xmath27 . the second result , together with , yields the quantum stationary hamilton - jacobi equation ( qshje ) . by rearranging , and making use of , we obtain : an important connection between the semiclassical and bohmian theories is suggested by namely , _ the semiclassical approximation is accurate when the quantum potential is small_.    let us now consider the semiclassical approximation proper  i.e . , with no @xmath28 term .",
    "the resultant algebraic equation has two solutions for @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath30}$]where lower case ` @xmath31 ' is now used , for reasons that will be explained shortly .",
    "these two solutions correspond to the positive and negative momentum `` sheets '' of the lm in phase space .",
    "the two sheets are joined together at the classical turning points , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , to form a single lm in phase space , along the classical hamiltonian contour , @xmath34 .",
    "( turning points are the caustics for stationary states ) .",
    "thus , the function @xmath29 is double - valued over the classically allowed region , @xmath35 , and zero - valued everywhere else .",
    "it is illuminating to compare the semiclassical situation , as described above , with the bohm prescription . from the correspondence principle ,",
    "one expects @xmath28 to be small in the large action limit  i.e . ,",
    "the limit in which the excitation numbers , @xmath36 , become large .",
    "this in turn would imply , via , that the semiclassical and exact quantum lms would resemble each other in the large action limit .",
    "the actual situation is completely different , however .",
    "firstly , imply that the quantum @xmath20 is single - valued everywhere  rather than zero- or double - valued , like the semiclassical @xmath29 .",
    "secondly , for stationary states , @xmath37 , implying that the quantum lm is the real axis of the phase space plane , which in no way resembles the semiclassical , hamiltonian - contour lm .",
    "thirdly , quantum trajectories are stationary over time , whereas semiclassical trajectories evolve around their lms ( sec .  [ trajectories ] ) .",
    "the origin of these seemingly profound qualitative differences is deceptively simple : it is due to the fact that the semiclassical approximation does not actually incorporate the unipolar ansatz of . instead ,",
    "a _ bipolar _ ansatz is used for the total wavefunction , consisting of two terms rather than one : in above , the constant @xmath38 specifies the relative phase between the two components , @xmath39 .",
    "it has been singled out from @xmath40 in order to clarify certain issues pertaining to square - integrability ( sec .",
    "[ quantization ] ) .",
    "although @xmath2 itself is real , the @xmath39 are both complex , and conjugate to each other .",
    "the stationary `` standing wave '' is therefore obtained in practice as the linear superposition of two `` traveling waves , '' moving in opposite directions .",
    "the standard bohmian prescription , being unipolar , completely misses out on this elegant and useful aspect of the semiclassical approach , which gives rise to a qualitatively very different kind of amplitude / action decomposition . on the other hand ,",
    "if the bipolar ansatz of is incorporated into the bohmian theory , rather than , then it is indeed possible to reconcile these two approaches , in a manner consistent with the correspondence principle , as will be shown in sec .",
    "[ decomposition ] .",
    "note , however , that an important difference between semiclassical and bipolar quantum lms is already evident in ; namely that the bipolar momentum function @xmath41 is double - valued throughout the entire coordinate range .",
    "thus , the two exact quantum lm sheets never join , but extend into the classically forbidden regions all the way to @xmath42 .    throughout this paper , we use lower case to denote the bipolar ansatz functions , so as to distinguish these from the unipolar ansatz functions , for which upper case is used . for convenience , all bipolar functions are hereafter defined to be single - valued everywhere , by referring to the positive - momentum lm sheet only ",
    ", @xmath43 .",
    "the increased flexibility of the bipolar ansatz is extremely useful vis - a - vis the treatment of nodes , for it allows for the direct representation of nodes as _ interference fringes arising naturally between the two traveling waves_. this possibility is exploited to great effect in semiclassical methods , which manage to contrive ( approximate ) bipolar amplitude functions @xmath44 that are completely _ nodeless_no matter how many nodes are present in @xmath2 itself .",
    "thus , apart from discontinuities near turning points ( associated with maslov indices@xcite ) , the semiclassical @xmath44 is smooth and positive , and the semiclassical @xmath40 is smooth and monotonically increasing .",
    "moreover , these decomposition functions tend to be very slowly varying , in relation to @xmath2 itself , particularly when the latter has many nodes .",
    "the above properties would of course also be beneficial for exact qtms  which from a practical standpoint , is a primary reason why the bipolar ansatz ought to be considered within a bohmian context .",
    "one difficulty is that the exact quantum bipolar decomposition of is _ not unique _ , in the sense that the qshje of has a two - parameter family of solutions.@xcite in particular , one trivial solution is @xmath45 , which simply reproduces the unipolar result .",
    "clearly , this is not the solution that we want , i.e. , one that exhibits semiclassical correspondence in the large action limit ; obtaining the latter will be the focus of sec .",
    "[ decomposition ] .    for the unipolar ansatz",
    ", it has been stated that nodes always give rise to infinities in @xmath28 , owing to the singular denominator in . however , this is only strictly true if the standard bohmian ansatz of is used , for which the @xmath46 convention is employed .",
    "if instead , one adopts the convention , so that @xmath12 smoothly changes sign as a node is traversed , then need not always be singular at a node .",
    "in particular , @xmath28 is _ never _ singular when @xmath2 is a stationary eigenstate of @xmath22 , provided @xmath17 is well - behaved everywhere .",
    "this is because the time - independent  equation guarantees that the nodes of @xmath2 also happen to be inflection points .",
    "using moreover , it can be shown that @xmath47 .",
    "thus , for the stationary states considered in this paper , even the unipolar ansatz is not singular , contrary to what previously has been widely considered to be the case .",
    "even if the standard bohmian ansatz is used , @xmath48 at a node does not exhibit a singularity per se , but is rather ill - defined , owing to the cusp in @xmath4 ; away from the nodal point , @xmath49 .    in any event , we find it useful and convenient to distinguish between two types of nodes , depending on whether @xmath28 is formally well - behaved ( `` type one '' nodes ) or singular ( `` type two '' nodes ) . from a numerical perspective , even type one nodes will cause difficulties for standard quantum trajectory calculations performed using the unipolar bohmian ansatz .",
    "this is because the slightest numerical error in the evaluation of the ratio will result in instability near the nodes  even though formally , @xmath28 does not diverge .",
    "in contrast , due to the smoothness and lack of nodes of the @xmath44 functions that arise in the bipolar decomposition , numerical evaluation of the corresponding bipolar quantum potentials , @xmath50 , causes no such instabilities for type one nodes .",
    "more general nodal implications of the bipolar ansatz will be discussed in greater detail in future publications .",
    "in this section , we derive a unique bipolar decomposition of the form , for any given stationary wavepacket , @xmath2 , which satisfies semiclassical correspondence in the large action limit .",
    "in general , the decomposition is nonunique .",
    "the semiclassical solution , however , is essentially unique ( sec ,  [ stationarybipolar ] ) .",
    "we will therefore use the latter as a guide , for selecting the particular quantum bipolar decomposition which most closely resembles the semiclassical solution .",
    "note that certain assumptions have already entered into the form of , which is clearly more constrained than a completely general bipolar decomposition of @xmath2 into two arbitrary components . in particular , we have presumed @xmath2 to be a superposition of equal and opposite traveling waves  a natural assumption , completely analogous to the semiclassical situation .",
    "be that as it may , there is still an enormous number of ways in which may be be realized for a given real wavepacket @xmath2 , and so the decomposition is still far from being unique .    to help narrow the field ,",
    "we first summarize some of the additional properties of semiclassical eigenstates in 1 dof , which we will attempt to emulate in the exact quantum decomposition :    1 .",
    "the lm itself _ does not change _ over time",
    "the classical probability distribution _ does not change _ over time .",
    "the classical flow for either lm sheet maintains _ invariant flux _ over all @xmath3 , with the flux value for the two sheets being equal and opposite .",
    "the area enclosed within the lm , i.e. the enclosed action , @xmath51 , is given by @xmath52 , where @xmath36 is the number of nodes .",
    "5 .   for a normalized distribution",
    ", the absolute value of the invariant flux equals the inverse of the period of the trajectory , i.e. @xmath53 .",
    "6 .   the median of the enclosed action , @xmath54 , satisfies @xmath55 .",
    "all trajectories move _ along _ the lm .    by `` translating '' these properties appropriately into the exact quantum context",
    ", we will be able to define an essentially unique bipolar decomposition of the form .",
    "properties ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) above are the most fundamental , and will be considered first . for a particular decomposition , the corresponding positive - momentum lm sheet is given by @xmath43 .",
    "property  ( 1 ) states that @xmath56 , which in turn implies @xmath57 .",
    "property ( 2 ) implies @xmath58 .",
    "together , these properties imply that the @xmath39 _ components _ of @xmath2 must be stationary eigenstates of @xmath22 in their own right .",
    "equation  ( [ twolm ] ) then implies that the eigenvalues for the two components must both be equal to @xmath23 .",
    "since the @xmath39 are stationary , the quantum mechanical flux associated with each of these components , i.e. is independent of @xmath3 , with equal and opposite constant values , @xmath59 .",
    "note that demonstrates that the quantum analog of property ( 3 ) is also satisfied  a necessary consequence of properties ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "we call this the `` invariant flux '' property .    for @xmath60 , @xmath61 , which reproduces the unipolar ansatz",
    ". we shall therefore hereafter restrict consideration to the @xmath62 case , for which the invariant flux property , and , provide a specification for @xmath63 , in terms of @xmath64 , and the constant , @xmath65 : r(x ) = [ rfeq ] note that if @xmath66 for all @xmath3 , then implies that @xmath67 for all @xmath3a desirable property for the positive momentum solution , also satisfied by the semiclassical solution .",

    "the two @xmath39 components are linearly independent .",
    "this implies that at least one of the two must be non-@xmath68 .",
    "in fact , being complex conjugates of each other , _ both _",
    "solutions must be non-@xmath68 .",

    "[ quantization ] ) ; but this implies via that @xmath44 diverges .",
    "it is instructive to rederive the invariant flux property in another manner . by the superposition principle",
    ", the time evolution of @xmath2 can be obtained by propagating each of the @xmath39 components separately in time . since",

    ", there is no distinction between classically allowed and forbidden regions ; one travels smoothly from one to the other , over the entire position space . since the two lm sheets are symmetrically placed in phase space about the real axis ( fig .",

    "the @xmath72 equation was seen to yield the same invariant flux relation , for each @xmath39 component ",
    "the @xmath101 equation , as applied separately to the two components , also yields identical results .",
    "one of the important ramifications of this is that the ansatz is preserved over time , at least for stationary eigenstates .    in any event , since @xmath39 are solutions to the equation , the @xmath102 equation must result in a lower - case version of the qshje [ ] , for which the bipolar quantum potential , @xmath50 , is defined via lower - case .",
    "we shall rewrite this qshje by expressing @xmath50 directly in terms of @xmath29 , using lower - case , and : @xcite p^2 = 2m(e - v ) - ^2 [ p2eq ] whereas the semiclassical approximation [ obtained by ignoring the @xmath50 term in brackets ] has a unique @xmath103 solution , is a second - order differential equation in @xmath29 , with a two - parameter _ family _ of different solutions to choose from .",
    "note that applies to _ all _  equation solutions , i.e. the @xmath68 and the non-@xmath68 solutions , both .",
    "since we are interested only in the former , and since there is a one - parameter family of  solutions in all , one might expect that the specification of the @xmath68 solution would determine the value of one of the two parameters .",

    "[ quantization ] ) .",
    "thus , even for the @xmath68 solution alone , bipolar decomposition gives rise to two variable parameters via .",

    "semiclassically , the flux for a normalized distribution is given by @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the classical angular frequency for the appropriate semiclassical trajectory ",

    "the normalization convention allows us to determine a unique flux value for the quantum trajectory , which is all that is required . by setting the quantum flux value equal to the semiclassical value",

    "consequently , we expect the greatest agreement of semiclassical and quantum lms ",
    "i.e . the smallest @xmath50 values  in the vicinity of the semiclassical @xmath54 .",
    "this can be achieved by allowing the quantum @xmath54 to coincide with the semiclassical value ",
    ", the latter is chosen to be the location where @xmath110 .    in the quantum bipolar decomposition scheme  even for fixed @xmath65one is otherwise free to place the action median , @xmath54 , essentially anywhere along the position axis .",
    "the ramifications are particularly illuminating when @xmath17 is even .",
    "for such potentials , _ only _ the choice @xmath81 gives rise to quantum bipolar decomposition functions that are even or odd in @xmath3 , thereby respecting the physical symmetry of the system , and of @xmath2 itself .",
    "this choice for @xmath54 is also consistent with the median action criterion . presumably , it would be unphysical to consider any of the asymmetrical decompositions ; nevertheless , it is interesting to note that one can generate _ asymmetrical _ bipolar decompositions that give rise to the _ symmetrical _",
    "@xmath2 , simply by shifting @xmath54 away from the origin .",
    "this has been verified via explicit construction for the harmonic oscillator ground state .",
    "we now address the issue of the quantum trajectories themselves , related to property ( 7 ) .",
    "semiclassically , over the course of time , the bound state trajectories simply move around and around the hamiltonian contour lms , which do not themselves change [ property ( 1 ) ] . in a conventional unipolar quantum treatment ,",
    "the initial lm  specifying the initial conditions for the ensemble of trajectories  is just the real axis , i.e. the `` curve '' @xmath111 , since @xmath2 is real .",
    "the quantum trajectories evolve under the unipolar modified potential , @xmath112 , which by , must be the constant function @xmath113 [ even if there are nodes ( sec .",
    "[ nodeissues ] ) ] .",
    "consequently , @xmath114 , and so the unipolar quantum trajectories _ do not move at all _ over time .",
    "in contrast , the bipolar quantum trajectories are _ not _ stationary , but move along the positive and negative momentum lm sheets .",
    "this is true because @xmath67 , and because the bipolar lms themselves do not change over time , thus verifying property ( 7 ) .",
    "moreover , provided the bipolar quantum potential @xmath50 is small in the classically allowed region , then the bipolar quantum trajectories must resemble the semiclassical trajectories within this region , since the lms are similar , and @xmath115 .",
    "of course , the bipolar quantum trajectories do _ not _ change their direction at the classical turning points , moving between positive and negative - momentum lm sheets , like classical trajectories .",
    "instead , all quantum trajectories on say , the positive momentum lm sheet , continue to head to the right for all time .",
    "once these trajectories enter the classically forbidden region , however , their speed decreases very suddenly .",
    "it is worth discussing the very different role played by the quantum potential in the unipolar ansatz , versus that of the bipolar ansatz with the specific decomposition suggested here ( i.e. , parameter choices of sec .",
    "[ paramchoice ] ) . in the unipolar case",
    ", @xmath28 serves to counteract the true potential everywhere ; thus , @xmath28 is not generally small .",
    "in contrast , the bipolar quantum potential , @xmath50 , can be regarded as the @xmath116 correction to the semiclassical approximation  in the truest correspondence - principle sense of lower - case .",
    "the value of @xmath50 is therefore small in the appropriate semiclassical limits ",
    ", in the classically allowed region far from turning points , and in the limit of large action , when @xmath36 becomes large .",
    "near the turning points , @xmath117 increases substantially , so as to ensure that all trajectories keep moving past the classical turning point without changing direction .",
    "this increase continues well into the classically forbidden region , where curiously , @xmath50 approaches @xmath28i.e .",
    "it effectively cancels out the true potential .",
    "consequently , the bipolar modified potential , @xmath118 , resembles the true potential in the classically allowed region , and the unipolar modified potential , @xmath113 , in the asymptotic regions .",
    "the above discussion hinges on the assumption that the semiclassical and bipolar quantum lms become arbitrarily close in the appropriate semiclassical limits described above .",
    "we can justify this expectation as follows .",
    "first , the semiclassical approximation is known to become arbitrarily accurate in these limits ; each of the two semiclassical traveling wave components must therefore approach some particular corresponding pair of exact quantum solutions , @xmath39 , arbitrarily closely .",
    "the latter must therefore have the same characteristics , vis - a - vis action , trajectories , and flux , as do the semiclassical approximations , in the appropriate limits .",
    "therefore , by choosing the available parameters for the quantum solutions ( i.e. @xmath65 and @xmath54 ) so as to match the semiclassical approximations , the correspondence principle must be satisfied .",
    "although the primary interest of this paper is bound , stationary eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath22 of , our ultimate interest is wavepackets that evolve dynamically over time . as a first step in this direction , we generalize the previous discussion to include wavepackets that are only momentarily `` stationary .

    "this results in @xmath72 , but only instantaneously , at the initial time .",
    "we shall call such a wavepacket a `` stationary non - eigenstate . ''",
    "to what extent can the bipolar decomposition scheme be applied to stationary non - eigenstate wavepackets ?",
    "the question is relevant , because it is only necessary to specify the bipolar decomposition at a single point in time , in order to propagate the two @xmath39 components independently , over all time .",

    "as does the present approach , it is clear that _ all three utilize essentially the same bipolar functions _",
    ", @xmath40 , @xmath44 , @xmath29 , and @xmath50 . however , there are some important differences .",
    "floyd uses a different convention , for which both the normalization of @xmath2 , and the flux , change simultaneously , so that his @xmath44 is proportional to ours .",
    "neither of the other methods identifies the two parameters associated with in the way that we have done , and they certainly do not provide a means of selecting preferred values for these parameters , as per sec .",
    "[ paramchoice ] .",
    "indeed , floyd considers each of the two - parameter family of solutions to , which he terms `` microstates , '' to constitute an equally valid decomposition of @xmath2 .",
    "he further asserts that since the  equation per se provides no means of distinguishing microstates , that the qshje must be regarded as the more fundamental equation , in some sense .",
    "floyd also acknowledges the fundamental differences between @xmath50 and @xmath28 , and the advantages of the former vis - a - vis nodes , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ nodeissues ] ( although he incorrectly claims that the latter is singular at the origin for the first excited harmonic oscillator eigenstate@xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", the lack of a criterion for selecting a prefered microstate implies that the quantum trajectories associated with his approach  termed `` floydian trajectories''will not in general approach classical trajectories in the correspondence principle limits .",
    "actually , there is another , more fundamental reason why floydian trajectories do not satisfy the correspondence principle .",
    "this is because the underlying dynamical law governing their evolution is radically different from that of the bohmian quantum trajectories utilized here .",
    "the trajectories are different , _ even though _ the bipolar decompositions are identical  a very curious situation that bears further analysis . in particular , the period of floydian trajectories is finite , necessitating a speed that approaches infinity as @xmath166 .",
    "in contrast , bohmian trajectories _",
    "rapidly slow down _ in the forbidden regions , never reaching the coordinate asymptotes , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ hoground ] .",
    "whereas floyd finds implications for hidden variables and the copenhagen interpretation , we adopt a decidedly less philosophically ambitious perspective",
    ".    the floydian dynamical law is obtained from the qshje by applying a classical procedure,@xcite wherein trajectory evolution is related to the quantity @xmath167 to yield x = ^-1 1 m s(x ) , [ floyd ] where @xmath118 is the bipolar modified potential .",
    "various interpretations may be provided for the @xmath168 factor in .",
    "fm adopt a relativistic interpretation which lumps it together with @xmath169 to form the `` effective quantum mass , '' whereas brown ( in essence ) uses it to define an `` effective time . '' in the bohmian approach , @xmath135 is regarded as independent of @xmath23 , thus giving rise to the usual @xmath170 relation . in the floydian approach",
    "however , @xmath135 is considered to depend on @xmath23 , giving rise to the more complicated expression above , for which the canonically conjugate momentum , @xmath29 , is not necessarily equal to mechanical momentum , @xmath171 .    how can the same @xmath135 be regarded as energy - independent in one theory and energy - dependent in another ?",
    "it has to do with different interpretations of the energy .",
    "one can make a distinction between the quantum energy , @xmath172 , and the classical energy , @xmath173 .",
    "the quantum energy is that of the eigenstate @xmath174 , which determines @xmath50 , @xmath135 , and @xmath175 .",
    "the contours of @xmath176 define the classical energies @xmath173 , with @xmath177 corresponding to the bipolar quantum lm .",
    "the function @xmath135 clearly depends on @xmath178 , but does not depend on @xmath179 .",
    "the meaning of therefore depends on whether @xmath180 ( floydian approach ) , or @xmath181 ( bohmian approach ) .",
    "floydian dynamics , therefore , represents a different philosophical outlook than that of bohmian dynamics .",
    "both approaches are correct , and ultimately yield mathematically identical results . the main point",
    "we wish to make here is simply that this difference does not appear to have anything to do with the bipolar ansatz per se .",
    "indeed , one could easily apply the floydian dynamical law to the _ unipolar _ ansatz  although for stationary eigenstates , this would yield the same results as bohmian propagation .",
    "we close this section with a few final comparisons between the floyd / fm and present approaches .",
    "first , we comment that quantum energies are discrete for bound states , and so any derivative with respect to @xmath172 requires careful consideration , as has been previously noted.@xcite this is relevant for floydian trajectories , but is essentially a non - issue for bohmian trajectories .",
    "second , although floyd has certainly considered the 1 dof harmonic oscillator system , he appears not to have derived analytic expressions for the relevant bipolar functions , as we have done in sec .",
    "[ horesults ] .",
    "we have , moreover , verified that floyd s closed form expression for the bipolar modified potential,@xcite u(x ) = e - 1/^2 , [ floydclosed ] is consistent with , by substituting @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 , and @xmath136 into .",
    "finally , we comment that the floyd / fm approach , being based on the qshje , does not appear to generalize to the non - stationary - case , whereas the present approach does  at least in certain situations .",
    "the  equation is linear , yet the equivalent obtained via substitution of the ansatz into the  equation  are not . quite apart from the philosophically intriguing issues which this raises ,",
    "a primary conclusion of the present work is that this situation may also be exploited for practical purposes . in particular ,",
    "the superposition principle allows us to divide up the initial wavepacket @xmath2 into pieces @xmath186 , evolve each of these separately over time , and then recombine them to construct the time - evolved @xmath2 itself .",
    "so far as the  equation is concerned , the division into @xmath186 pieces is arbitrary .",
    "however , if the evolution of the @xmath186 is performed using , nonlinearity implies that the division is _ not _ arbitrary , but has a large impact on the time - dependent behavior of the resultant @xmath187 and @xmath188 .    in principle ,",
    "therefore , one may improve the numerical performance of quantum trajectory calculations simply by judiciously dividing up the initial wavepacket into several pieces .",
    "it remains to be seen the extent to which such a procedure will prove beneficial for actual numerical calculations of real molecular systems  to be sure , much depends on the manner in which @xmath2 is decomposed .",
    "nevertheless , the particular bipolar scheme explored in this paper , already appears to exhibit much promise  at least with regard to ameliorating the infamous node problem , which has thus far severely limited the effectiveness of qtms in the molecular arena .",
    "the basic idea is to decompose a wavepacket , @xmath2 , that _ has _ nodes , into a linear combination of two components , @xmath39 , that do not . in practice , it is not only nodes per se that cause problems for numerical qtms , but more generally , any large or rapid oscillations in @xmath2 . thus , @xmath39 should ideally be not only nodeless , but also smooth and slowly varying .",
    "for the special case where @xmath2 is a stationary hamiltonian eigenstate , the semiclassical method is well - known to yield approximate @xmath39 functions with the requisite properties  even when @xmath2 itself is highly oscillatory .",
    "it is for this reason that the semiclassical solutions were used as a guide for determining the corresponding exact quantum @xmath39 s .",
    "not only have we provided an explicit recipe for obtaining the latter , we have also shown that these satisfy the correspondence principle in the appropriate semiclassical limits .",
    "thus , the bipolar quantum potential , @xmath50 , obtained here  now understood to represent the quantum correction to the semiclassical approximation  is not only well - behaved in the vicinity of nodes , but actually approaches zero , in the large action limit .",
    "the bipolar quantum trajectories also behave very much like classical / semiclassical trajectories ; indeed , the two are nearly identical in the classically allowed region , in the large action limit .",
    "this may seem paradoxical , as both bipolar and unipolar quantum trajectories conform to the same dynamical law , and the latter are known to behave very non - classically .",
    "unipolar trajectories do not cross in position space , for instance  which can cause kinky trajectories and other node - related difficulties , especially when the wavepacket undergoes reflection .",
    "the bipolar trajectories get around this difficulty as follows : whereas the trajectories _ on a single lm sheet _",
    "never cross each other , they are all headed in the same direction anyway , and so they do nt get in each other s way . on the other hand , trajectories on one lm sheet",
    "are free to cross those on the other sheet  just like the corresponding semiclassical trajectories . from a philosophical standpoint",
    ", one might thus regard the present bipolar decomposition to be more compelling than the standard unipolar approach ",
    "although curiously , this stance would require one to abandon bohm s original pilot wave interpretation .",
    "the above discussion anticipates future application of the present ideas to arbitrary time - evolving wavepackets ; but it must be borne in mind that thus far , only stationary wavepackets have been considered .",
    "it is encouraging that the bipolar decomposition scheme outlined here was found to be preserved over time for stationary states ( sec .",
    "[ qshjeintro ] ) . on the other hand , for the more general time - evolving case",
    ", the lms themselves will change over time , and the bipolar decomposition scheme itself need not be preserved .",
    "it is therefore possible that the initially nodeless @xmath39 s may develop nodes over the course of time .",
    "this need not cause difficulties in practice however , because at any desired time , one is free to redecompose @xmath2 into new @xmath39 s that _ are _ nodeless .",
    "one of the most appealing aspects of the excited harmonic oscillator results of sec .",
    "[ hoexcited ] is the fact that the bipolar functions remain smooth and slowly varying for all values of @xmath36 .",
    "indeed , the lms for all @xmath36 values resemble each other , apart from a change of scale .",
    "this is very advantageous from a numerical perspective , as it suggests that very few trajectories would be needed to accurately compute @xmath149 derivatives , if a completely numerical propagation scheme were adopted .",
    "more to the point : the number of trajectories required should be essentially _ independent _ of the number of nodes . for sufficiently large @xmath36 , it should even be possible to perform an accurate calculation with _ fewer than @xmath36 trajectories_a prospect that would be virtually unheard of in a unipolar context .",
    "note that since the bipolar trajectories themselves are also much smoother than the unipolar trajectories , far fewer time steps should be required in the bipolar case .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion of the prospects for multidimensional systems . at present , it is not entirely clear how best to apply bipolar decomposition to an arbitrary , real , multidimensional wavepacket , @xmath189 . for regular systems ,",
    "semiclassical theory suggests an essentially direct - product decomposition , via pairs of action - angle coordinates .",
    "generally speaking , however , it is difficult to find these coordinates  unless the wavepacket is initially separable , which is very often the case in molecular applications . on the other hand",
    ", the factor - of - two bifurcation applies to each degree of freedom separately , resulting in @xmath190 components total , where @xmath191 is the number of dofs .",
    "this is clearly undesirable for large @xmath191 .",
    "a more effective strategy may be to bifurcate @xmath2 along the _ reaction coordinate only_. these and other ideas will be explored in future publications .",
