    "historically the casimir effect is known as the small force acting between two parallel uncharged perfect conducting plates .",
    "the attractive force per unit area is @xcite    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is plank s constant divided by @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the velocity of light and @xmath5 is the separation between the two conducting plates .",
    "though the force can be thought of as a limiting case of the van der waals interaction when retardation is included @xcite , it does not depend on the electric charge .",
    "this encourages one to look for a new interpretation of the force .",
    "it is known that the phenomena stems from the quantum aspect of the electromagnetic field , since the force tends to zero when we try to find the classical limit .",
    "the force can , therefore , be considered as the reaction of the vacuum of the quantum field against the presence of the boundary surface or surfaces @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the effect is simply the stress on the boundary surfaces due to the confinement of a quantum field in a finite volume of space .",
    "the restriction on the modes of the quantum field gives rise to the force acting on the macroscopic bodies @xcite .",
    "great variety of problems of practical and theoretical interests are intimately connected to various quantum fields having mass or massless , quanta of different spin .",
    "the later interpretation of the casimir force signifies that the effect can not be merely for the electromagnetic field , and all the other quantum fields must display the same effect @xcite .",
    "it is , in fact , the most important characteristic of the casimir effect in all instances that it depends neither on electric charge nor on any other coupling constants , but it does build on the quantum nature of the fields @xcite . the effect can be displayed in @xmath0 space - time dimensions for a variety of boundary surfaces and boundary conditions , and manifested on all scales , from the substructure of quarks @xcite to the large scale structure of the universe @xcite .",
    "there are different approaches to calculate the casimir force @xcite .",
    "perhaps , the most usual one is to calculate the casimir energy @xcite .",
    "this is simply the difference between the zero point energy in the presence and the absence of the boundaries .",
    "the casimir energy is apparently a function of the position of the boundaries .",
    "once the casimir energy is evaluated , the force is obtained easily by differentiation .",
    "this approach can be cast into a more technical framework based upon the use of green function .",
    "the green function is related to the vacuum expectation value of the time ordered products of the field .",
    "it is , therefore , possible to calculate the casimir energy in terms of the green function at coincident arguments @xcite .",
    "the equivalence of the sum of the zero point energy of the modes and the vacuum expectation value of the field is straightforward . in an alternative approach",
    "one may obtain the variation in the electromagnetic energy when the dielectric function is varied .",
    "the vacuum force between two semi - infinite parallel dielectrics can be obtained in this way @xcite .",
    "the wide application of the effect on the one hand and the recent growth on the experimental verification of the phenomena @xcite on the other hand , demands some more illuminative and simpler derivation of this effect for different quantum fields .",
    "the vacuum force is an indication of the momentum inherent in a quantized field when the field is in its vacuum state .",
    "we are thus led to quantize the field for the particular geometry in question , and thereafter , calculate the casimir force using the energy momentum tensor .",
    "this is the most straightforward and clear treatment which provides both the force and the interpretation of the effect .",
    "apart from a few simple configurations @xcite , considerable difficulties arise in practice when the field is to be quantized .",
    "any simplification in this formalism is therefore of value whenever more complicated geometries are involved .",
    "this is achieved by using the fluctuation dissipation theorem and kubo s formula @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to develop this approach into the massive scalar field .",
    "this may be a step forward to make a simple unified , yet comprehensive treatment of the casimir force in a wide variety of domains and variously shaped configurations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we begin with the quantization of the massive scalar field in 1 + 1 space - time dimensions in the presence of two nonpenetrating plates .",
    "the attractive force between the two plates is obtained by the use of the latter field operators .",
    "the formalism is developed to 3 + 1 space - time dimensions in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv , we calculate the vacuum force in both 1 + 1 and 3 + 1 space - time dimensions by using the fluctuation dissipation theorem and kubo s formula .",
