    "methods of physics and modern computer science have been used successfully for the investigation of vehicular traffic problems for a long time @xcite . also pedestrian dynamics",
    "has attracted some attention in recent years @xcite and many interesting collective effects and self - organisation phenomena have been observed ( for an overview see @xcite ) .",
    "one topic which has not been studied intensively up to now ( see , however , @xcite ) is the relevance of local conflicts in pedestrian traffic .",
    "a conflict indicates a situation in which two or more people try to enter the same space in one timestep . obviously this is a real two - dimensional effect which has no counterpart in ( directed ) one - dimensional vehicular traffic .",
    "these conflicts are local phenomena which can have a strong influence on global quantities like evacuation times and flows in the presence of bottlenecks",
    ". typical examples where conflicts become important are situations with clogging and stucking encountered in crowds of panicing pedestrians , e.g.  near intersections and bottlenecks . in real life",
    "this often leads to very dangerous situations and injuries or even fatalities during evacuations . from a physics point of view",
    "these phenomena are related to flow properties of granular materials @xcite .",
    "depending on the choice of parameters , the cellular automaton ( ca ) model introduced in @xcite is able to reproduce many of the observed collective effects of pedestrian dynamics , i.e.  panicing and herding behaviour @xcite . in this paper the model",
    "is extended by a friction parameter @xmath0 , which allows an improved description of clogging and stucking phenomena of pedestrians .",
    "it will be shown that conflicts and friction are responsible for several interesting effects which become especially relevant in high density situations , e.g.  during evacuation processes , and that they are important for a correct reproduction of the dynamics .",
    "we start with a short summary of the model s basic concepts and its update rules .",
    "the model considered here is a ca where the space is discretized into small cells which can either be empty or occupied by exactly one pedestrian .",
    "each of these pedestrians can move to one of its unoccupied neighbour cells ( see fig .",
    "[ trans ] ) at each discrete time step @xmath1 according to certain transition probabilities .    .",
    "]    the probabilities are given by the interaction with two discrete _ floor fields _ , @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the field strengths @xmath4 and @xmath5 at site @xmath6 are interpreted as number of @xmath2- and @xmath3-particles , respectively , present at that site .",
    "the two fields determine the transition probability in such a way that a particle movement in the direction of higher fields becomes more likely .    the dynamic floor field @xmath2 represents a virtual trace left by _ moving _ pedestrians . similar to the process of chemotaxis @xcite used by some insects for communication",
    ", this trace has its own dynamics , namely diffusion and decay .",
    "two parameters , @xmath7 @xmath8 $ ] and @xmath9 @xmath8 $ ] , control the broadening and dilution of the trace .",
    "every moving pedestrian creates a @xmath2-particle at its origin cell .",
    "since there is no restriction of the maximal number of @xmath2-particles at a site , @xmath2 can be regarded as a _",
    "bosonic field_.    the static floor field @xmath3 , on the other hand , does not change in time .",
    "it reflects the surrounding geometry and e.g.  specifying attractive space regions . in the case of the evacuation processes considered here ,",
    "the static floor field describes the shortest distance to an exit door .",
    "@xmath3 is calculated for each lattice site using some distance metric .",
    "the field value increases in the direction of the exit such that it is largest for door cells .",
    "an explicit construction of @xmath3 can be found in @xcite .",
    "the floor fields are used to translate a long - ranged spatial interaction into a local interaction , but with memory , similar to the phenomenon of chemotaxis in biology .",
    "the only other model which so far reproduces all observed collective effects of pedestrian flow , the social - force model @xcite , uses exponentially decaying repulsive forces between pedestrians .",
    "in contrast , in our approach the interaction is local and attractive .",
    "however , pedestrians do not interact with the density , but with the velocity density created by the other particles .",
    "the update rules of the full model , including the interaction with the two floor fields , have the following structure :    1 .",
    "the dynamic floor field @xmath2 is modified according to its diffusion and decay rules @xcite , controlled by the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath9 . in each time step of the simulation",
    "each single boson of the whole dynamic field @xmath2 decays with the probability @xmath9 and diffuses with the probability @xmath7 to one of its neighbouring cells . 2 .   for each pedestrian ,",
    "the transition probabilities @xmath10 for a move to an unoccupied neighbour cell @xmath6 ( fig .",
    "[ trans ] ) are determined by the local dynamics and the two floor fields .",
    "the values of the fields @xmath2 and @xmath3 are weighted with two sensitivity parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this yields @xmath13 with the occupation number @xmath14 , the obstacle number @xmath15 and the normalization @xmath16^{-1}\\,.\\ ] ] 3 .",
    "each pedestrian chooses randomly a target cell based on the transition probabilities @xmath10 determined by ( [ formula ] ) .",
    "conflicts arising by any two or more pedestrians attempting to move to the same target cell are resolved by a probabilistic method .",
    "the pedestrians which are allowed to move execute their step .",
    "the explicit procedure of conflict resolution will be described in detail in section [ conflicts ] .",
    "@xmath2 at the origin cell @xmath6 of each _ moving _ particle is increased by one : @xmath17 .",
    "the above rules are applied to all pedestrians at the same time ( parallel update ) .",
    "this introduces a timescale of about @xmath18sec / timestep @xcite .",
    "due to the use of parallel dynamics it is possible that two or more particles choose the same destination cell in step 3 of the update procedure .",
    "such situations will be called _",
    "conflicts_. at first it appears that conflicts are undesirable effects which reduce the efficiency of simulations and should therefore be avoided by choosing a different update scheme .",
    "we will show in the following that this is not the case and that conflicts are important for a correct description of the physics of crowd dynamics .      in @xcite conflicts between pedestrians",
    "were solved in the following way : whenever @xmath19 particles share the same target cell , one ( @xmath20 ) is chosen to move while its rivals for the same target keep their position .",
    "there are two main ways to decide which particle @xmath21 is allowed to move :    1 .",
    "according to the relative probabilities with which each particle chooses its target cell , i.e.  the probability for particle @xmath21 to move is @xmath22 .",
    "2 .   all particles move with the same probability @xmath23 .",
    "the observed behaviour has been shown to be quite robust and does not depend on the details of the conflict resolution @xcite .",
    "we now extend the basic model by a new friction parameter @xmath24 $ ] , in order to describe clogging and stucking effects between the pedestrians .",
    "whenever two or more pedestrians try to attempt to move to the same target cell , the movement of _ all _ involved particles is denied with the probability @xmath0 , i.e.  all pedestrians remain at their site ( see fig .",
    "[ plot_0 ] ) .",
    "this means that with probability @xmath25 one of the individuals moves to the desired cell . which particle actually moves",

    "the friction parameter might be interpreted as the effect of a moment of hesitation : pedestrians in conflict situations slow down or hesitate for a short moment when trying to resolve the conflict .",
    "this reduces on average the velocities of all involved particles .    with the above definition of @xmath0 and the extended update rule",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath0 works as some kind of local pressure between the pedestrians .",
    "if @xmath0 is high , the pedestrians handicap each other trying to reach their desired target sites .",
    "as we will see , this local effect can have enormous influence on macroscopic quantities like flow and evacuation time .",
    "we like to point out that friction as introduced here does not reduce the velocity of a freely moving particle .",
    "its effects only show up in local _",
    "interactions_.    as one can see it is necessary for such kind of investigations to use a parallel update in the model .",
    "any other form of random or ordered sequential update will disguise the real number of arising conflicts between the pedestrians in the system .",
    "in the following we describe results of simulations for a typical situation , i.e.  the evacuation of a large room ( e.g.  in case of fire ) . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that by variation of the sensitivity parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( see sec .",
    "[ update ] ) three main regimes for the behaviour of the particles can be distinguished . for strong coupling @xmath27 and very small coupling @xmath28",

    "as we will see the influence of @xmath0 is strongest in the ordered regime .",
    "this will lead to a new interpretation of this regime .",
    "we consider a grid of size @xmath30 sites with a small exit of one cell in the middle of one wall .",

    "furthermore the number of dangerous conflicts close to the door  which have a direct influence on @xmath29 ( see the discussion in sec .  [ sec_number ] )  is reduced .    comparing the cases 2 and 3",
    ", the existence of the column reduces the evacuation time in both cases due to the above reason .",
    "however , for case  2 of a central column evacuation times are larger than for the shifted one of case  3 . in case  2 ,",
    "_ all _ the people in the room have to avoid the column and take a detour , while for a slightly shifted column some still can reach the exit directly .",
    "thus a central column has a stronger screening effect which leads to the increase of the evacuation time compared to the slightly shifted case . in case  4",
    ", the column does not contribute so much to the subdivision of the flow , but acts more like an obstacle .",
    "for larger shifts the results will approach those of case 1 .",
    "we have extended a recently introduced stochastic cellular automaton for pedestrian dynamics by incorporating friction effects .",
    "these are closely related to the occurance of conflicts , i.e.  situations where several people try to occupy the same space .",
    "such conflicts are only resolved with probability @xmath25 , where @xmath0 is called friction parameter .",
    "this implies that friction as introduced here does not influence the motion of a single pedestrian ( e.g.  by reducing her average speed ) , but appears only through interactions .",
    "friction effects become important in situations where locally high density regions occur .",
    "it therefore can have a strong impact on global quantities like evacuation times although it acts only locally .    to elucidate friction effects and the role of conflicts we have investigated a simple evacuation scenario , especially the evacuation time and the time evolution of the process . without friction three different regimes with different behaviour",
    "can be distinguished , as shown in @xcite .",
    "introducing @xmath68 affects these regimes in a different way .    in general , the ordered regime , characterized by strong coupling to the static field and weak coupling to the dynamic field ,",
    "is affected most .",
    "this is not surprising since for sufficiently large initial densities large queues are formed at exits and clogging becomes relevant .",
    "the introduction of friction leads to a strong increase of the evacuation time ( fig .",
    "[ plot_1b ] ) due to a strong increase of conflicts ( figs .",
    "[ plot_11 ] , [ plot_11b ] ) . here",
    "it is important that the conflicts occur mainly very close to the exit and thus have an immediate influence on the outflow .",
    "in contrast , in the other regimes conflicts typically occur everywhere in the system and have therefore a weaker influence on the outflow properties .    apart",
    "form evacuation times we have also investigated the time evolution of an evacuation process . after the introduction of friction",
    "the outflow is irregular with periods of stucking .",
    "this leads to plateaus in the number @xmath57 of evacuated persons after time @xmath48 very similar to the behaviour observed in granular flow @xcite . here",
    "the formation and breaking of arches is responsible for the irregular flow .",
    "similar in our case friction is responsible for the formation of arch - like structures that block the flow close to the door . the plateaus occur randomly and",
    "can therefore not be seen after averaging over different samples .",
    "the averaged @xmath49-curves typically show a linear behaviour . using simple combinatorial arguments we found @xmath69 for the @xmath0-dependence of the asymptotic behaviour of the number of evacutated persons .",
    "this expression agrees quite well with the numerical data for densities not too small up to intermediate values of @xmath0 .",
    "finally we have shown in sec .",
    "[ sub_column ] that the introduction of friction is essential to reproduce the surprising effects observed in @xcite when placing an additional column in front of the exit . as in @xcite this column does not necessarily act as an obstacle , but can  under certain conditions , e.g.  a slightly asymmetric position  improve evacuation times considerably .",
    "the fact that the model used here differs in many respects from the social - force model @xcite ( e.g.  sign and type of interactions ) used in @xcite implies a certain robustness of this phenomenon .        defining the function @xmath70 }",
