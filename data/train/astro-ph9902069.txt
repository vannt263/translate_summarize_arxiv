    "ionized gas deforms the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) via inverse compton scattering , the resulting spectral distortion being known as the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1980 ; see for a recent review birkenshaw , 1998 ) .",
    "the most popular source of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect is hot x - ray emitting gas in a cluster of galaxies .",
    "the effects of the intracluster gas have been estimated theoretically by many authors ( see e.g. , makino & suto 1993;aghanim et al .",
    "1997 ) , and there exist observations of the temperature decrement towards rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "recently aghanim et al.(1996 ) studied the effects of the partial ionization of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) by quasar uv radiation .",
    "they showed that the kinematical effect due to the peculiar motions of the ionized bubbles is much larger than the thermal effect and can be detected by future generations of cmb observations .",
    "natarajan & sigurdsson ( 1999 ) exmanied the sunyaev - zeldovich effect in the region formed by the quasar outflows .",
    "we examine here another source of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect which is associated with radio galaxies .",
    "it has been suggested that a standard model for a typical strong double radio source comprises twin jets advancing into the intergalactic medium and surrounded by a hot region ` cocoon ' that consists of jet - supplied matter and shocked igm ( scheuer 1974 ; blandford & rees 1974 ) .",
    "begelman & cioffi ( 1989 ) and nath ( 1995 ) constructed a model of the evolution of a cocoon in which the cocoon is overpressured against the igm during its initial evolution . in their model ,",
    "the expansion along the jet axis is determined by the balance of the thrust of the jet and the ram pressure , and the thermal pressure of the cocoon drives the expansion along the direction perpendicular to the jet axis .",
    "it has been demonstrated that some numerical simulations agree with this scenario ( loken et al .",
    "1992 ; cioffi & blondin 1992 ) .",
    "the energy density of the cocoon is higher than that of the intergalactic medium , and therefore it works as a local hot region that induces the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich effect much as is observed for the hot intracluster gas in galaxy clusters . when we consider the lifetime of the jet(@xmath1 year ) , which is considered to be shorter than the hubble time at the redshift where radio galaxies reside , cocoons may not play a significant role in the deformation of the cmb spectrum .",
    "however , even after the jet energy supply stops , cocoons can remain hot ; the cocoon expands due to its own thermal pressure , and the thermal energy of the cocoon is consumed by expansion and radiative cooling by the cocoon gas .",
    "thus the cocoon remains a possible source of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect for an effective lifetime that can be much longer than the jet lifetime .",
    "we estimate the sunyaev - zeldovich effect due to the cocoons by taking into account their evolution both while the jet is on and after the jet is off .",
    "we make use of the simple model of nath ( 1995 ) for the evolution while the jet is on , and first estimate a rough order of @xmath0 for a single cocoon .",
    "we construct a model for the evolution after the jet is off , and evaluate the average compton @xmath0 parameter for a uniform distribution of cocoons . comparing our result with the _ cobe _ constraint",
    ", we discuss the possibility of detection of the effect of cocoons in the cmb observations .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we summarize our basic calculation and list the parameters we need to estimate in order to apply evolutionary models for the cocoons . in  3 and  4",
    "we describe models of cocoon evolution during the period while , and after , the jet is on . in  5 we calculate the sunyaev - zeldovich effect and give our results .",
    "discussion and conclusions are given in  6 .",
    "first we represent the formal expression of the compton @xmath0 parameter and clarify what parameters we need to estimate . for a single cocoon ,",
    "@xmath2    where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 are the thomson scattering cross section , electron number density , electron temperature , pressure , and distance element along the line of sight , respectively . in the second equation , we set the length scale along the line of sight @xmath8 as averaged for directions over a randomly oriented distribution of cocoons .",
    "the total @xmath0 in a line of sight with a solid angle element @xmath9 is the integral of the product of @xmath10 , the formation rate of cocoons , the volume element @xmath11 , and the crossing probability , as    @xmath12    here , @xmath13 is the cosmological scale factor , @xmath14 is the comoving radial coordinate , @xmath15 is the angular diameter distance , @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the number density of radio galaxies with mass @xmath18 at @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the probability for the line of sight to traverse the cocoon , respectively .",
    "the angular diameter distance @xmath15 is given by @xmath21.\\ ] ] strictly speaking , other than their mass scales , the epoch of the collapse of objects depends on various factors such as the amplitude or density distribution within each object .",
    "however , in the second and third equations , we assume for simplicity that the objects which have the same mass collapse at almost the same epoch , and replace @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "thus in order to evaluate @xmath0 , we only need the value of @xmath24 for each cocoon . in  3 and 4",
    "we examine the evolution of @xmath24 within a cocoon with the jet on and off .",
    "in this section we consider an evolutionary model of a strong double radio source with jets ( scheuer , 1974 ; blandford & rees 1974 ; begelman & cioffi 1989 ; nath 1995 ) and make a rough estimate of @xmath0 for a single cocoon .",
    "we follow the model proposed by nath ( 1995 ) , in which the jets are enveloped in a hot cocoon consisting of shock - compressed jet matter and intergalactic medium ( igm ) . in this model ,",
    "the jets are confined by the pressure of the cocoon , i.e. , we do not take confinement by magnetic pressure into account .",
    "highly collimated , ` light ' ( the density of the jet matter is smaller than the ambient igm ) jets interact with the igm and form bow shocks . at the shock , some of the electrons are accelerated to high energy and radiate synchrotron emission .",
    "the thermalization efficiency is one of the unknown parameters in this model ; however , because in many lobes of radio galaxies , magnetic fields have been observed , we expect that the effective mean free path of the particles should be short and the thermalization efficiency should be high because of the interaction with the magnetic field .",
    "therefore in this paper , the relativistic jet matter is assumed to be completely thermalized at the interaction interface with the igm .",
    "the thermalized jet matter forms a high temperature region around the jet together with the shock - compressed intergalactic medium .",
    "the shock - compressed intergalactic medium surrounds the thermalized jet matter separated by a contact discontinuity ( see figure [ image ] ) .",
    "at least initially , the thermal pressure of this hot region is higher than the igm pressure .",
    "when the hot region pressure is higher than that of the igm , the hot region also expands in the direction perpendicular to the jet axis and is accompanied by shocks .",
    "we make use of the term ` cocoon ' for the hot region surrounded by the shock surface . as the cocoon expands the pressure decreases .",
    "nath ( 1995 ) estimated the equilibrium timescale , i.e. , the time required until the cocoon pressure decreases sufficiently with time to be equal to the ambient pressure :    =    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the kinetic power of the jet , @xmath27 is the shock advance speed into the igm , @xmath28 is the jet speed , @xmath29 is the effective cross section of the bow shock , @xmath30 is the volume factor ( which depends on the shape of the cocoon ) , @xmath31 is the density of the igm in unit of the critical density , @xmath32km / sec / mpc , respectively , and the suffix @xmath13 denotes igm value .",
    "it is found with observed values of cygnus a that @xmath33 is longer than the jet lifetime as long as @xmath34k : i.e. , cocoons remain overpressured while the jet is on .",
    "hereafter we consider two collimated steady jets advancing into the ambient igm .",
    "the thermalized jet matter and the shock - compressed igm matter form a cocoon around the jets and the cocoon expands with shocks advancing in directions both parallel and perpendicular to the jet axis .",
    "below we will derive some relations between the various variables in order to obtain @xmath35 during this stage of evolution .    at the shock ,",
    "the jet thrust is balanced by the ram pressure of the igm at the shock that works on the effective area @xmath29 ,    @xmath36    the kinetic power @xmath26 is written as follows with jet speed @xmath37 . from observations and theory of the superluminal motions of the quasars , @xmath37 is considered to be approximately equal to the speed of light .",
    "therefore ,    @xmath38    here @xmath39 is the cross section of the jet . at the interaction of the jet and igm",
    ", a bow shock is formed . following nath ( 1995 ) , we approximate the bow shock as two oblique shocks",
    ". then the jump condition at the oblique shocks is @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the angle between two oblique shocks , and @xmath42 is the sound velocity of the ambient medium .",
    "as we mentioned above , because the cocoon is overpressured against the igm , the shock also advances into the igm in the direction perpendicular to the jet . the jump condition there is @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the shock advance speed .",
    "finally , we assume that the internal energy within the cocoon is supplied by the jet matter , and that jet kinetic energy is transformed into the thermal energy of the cocoon gas and the kinetic energy to expand the cocoon .",
    "we also assumed the fraction of input energy that is converted to other forms of energy ( magnetic fields or high energy cosmic rays : see discussion in  6 ) can be neglected . from strong shock conditions , @xmath45 is the same order as the random velocity of the cocoon gas , and therefore the fraction of the thermal energy to the total input energy @xmath46 is @xmath47 , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the adiabatic index and @xmath50 is the time elapsed since the jet is on .",
    "the final equation comes from the assumption that @xmath27 is constant @xmath51 .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that @xmath27 decreases and @xmath29 increases with time ( loken et al .",
    "1992 ; cioffi & blondin , 1992 ) . however , the time - dependence is relatively small ( @xmath52 with @xmath53 in their simulations ) , and therefore we assume @xmath27 is constant for the estimate of @xmath10 . note that for the estimate of total @xmath0 , as described in  2 , we only need @xmath35 , and therefore do not need the detailed evolutionary scenario ( see eq.[[lj ] ] ) .    in order to estimate the compton @xmath0 parameter value , we need the number density @xmath23 and @xmath35 of objects with mass @xmath18 and redshift @xmath54 .",
    "as we show in  5 , we use the press - schechter formalism for @xmath23 .",
    "therefore we need to write the product of the pressure of the cocoon @xmath55 and @xmath56 as function of @xmath50 , mass of the host galaxy @xmath18 , and the parameters of the ambient medium .",
    "we make additional assumptions about the jet kinetic luminosity .",
    "we assume that @xmath26 is equal to the eddington luminosity of the black hole @xmath57 ergs / sec . for the mass of the black hole",
    "some recent observations showed that there is a rough proportionality between the mass of the black hole and the host galaxy , @xmath58 ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; ford et al . 1997",
    "; van der marel 1997 ) . using these assumptions",
    "we can write @xmath26 in terms of the mass of the host galaxy . integrating equation ( [ vc ] ) , we obtain the relation    @xmath59    using the above equations we obtain the following expressions for @xmath55 and @xmath56 ,    @xmath60 ^{1/5 } , \\label{pc } \\\\ v & = & \\frac{(\\gamma-1)}{p_c}l_jt ~ . \\label{v}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    according to the usual discussions of synchrotron spectral aging , the minimum age of the jet is typically about @xmath61 years ( liu , pooley , & riley 1992 ) .",
    "so if we take cosmological values for the ambient medium with @xmath62 ,    @xmath63    and @xmath0 ,    @xmath64    thus we expect that the deformation of cmb caused by cocoons is possibly relevant to observations .",
    "after the relatively short lifetime @xmath65 years , the jet turns off .",
    "however , after the jet is off , cocoons may retain a high temperature and remain a source of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect for a long time .",
    "a cocoon cools radiatively and expands due to its own thermal overpressure .",
    "we need to estimate the effective lifetime of the cocoon with the jets off , as a ` relic ' of the radio galaxy .",
    "a cocoon can be considered as an energy input into the intergalactic medium .",
    "thus the evolution of a cocoon after the jet is off resembles the evolution of a supernova remnant in the interstellar medium .",
    "we may therefore adopt the analogy with the evolution of a supernova remnant .",
    "it is a well - known result that there are three stages in the evolution of a supernova remnant in the interstellar medium ( spitzer 1978 ) .",
    "first , the remnant expands freely at nearly constant speed into the surrounding medium . in this phase",
    ", the deceleration due to the swept - up interstellar matter in front of the shock does not intervene in the expansion .",
    "as the shock plows into the interstellar matter , it begins to decelerate .",
    "when the mass of the swept - up matter @xmath66 becomes nearly equal to the mass of the ejecta @xmath67 , one needs to take into account the deceleration of the shock front .",
    "thereafter the evolution goes into the next stage , the sedov ( adiabatic ) phase . in this sedov phase ,",
    "the temperature behind the shock front is so high that deceleration due to cooling behind the shock front can be ignored compared with the expansion .",
    "there is a well - known similarity solution for the evolution of the shock front ,    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the initial energy input and @xmath70 with @xmath49=5/3 ( shu 1992 ) . as the shock decelerates and the temperature behind the front decreases , cooling begins to affect the expansion and a dense shell is formed behind the shock front .",
    "almost all the mass of the ejecta and plowed - up interstellar medium are in the shell , and the thermal energy of the remnant is radiated away by the shell .",
    "the condition to be satisfied at the transition from the sedov phase to the radiative phase is @xmath71 .",
    "when this condition is satisfied , i.e. , the cooling time subsequently becomes shorter than expansion time of the shell , the thermal energy of the remnant is radiated very rapidly ( chevalier 1974 ) .",
    "we will examine the evolution of the cocoon after the jet turns off by analogy with the evolution of the supernova remnant described above .",
    "cocoons should have three evolutionary stages as do supernova remnants .",
    "let the cocoon evolve into the sedov phase at @xmath72 and into the radiative phase at @xmath73 with @xmath50=0 at the time when the jet stops .",
    "first , the cocoon expands with nearly constant speed .",
    "the shock surrounding the cocoon engulfs the intergalactic medium .",
    "accordingly the kinetic energy is turned into the thermal energy , and the fraction of the thermal energy of the shock - compressed igm to the total energy input by the jet , @xmath74 , increases with time .",
    "let us consider similarly as the case of supernova remnant further .",
    "the deceleration by the piled - up igm can not be ignored when the fraction of kinetic energy , @xmath75 , which is transformed into thermal energy , approaches unity . at this epoch",
    "we can consider that the sedov phase sets in .",
    "as we wrote in  3 , while the jet is on , @xmath76 is the same order as @xmath77 , and therefore one can regard that the sedov phase begins when @xmath78 . in other words , @xmath79 is about the same as the time required to double the thermal energy of the cocoon at the time when the jet stops ( @xmath80 ) . remembering that the cocoon expands almost constantly before the sedov phase because of lack of swept material which decelerates the expansion ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath81 , we can consider that the cocoon evolves into the sedov phase at @xmath82 , since @xmath83 .",
    "the radiative phase begins when the cooling time behind the shock front @xmath84 catches up with the expansion time of the sedov phase @xmath85 .",
    "because the thermal energy of the cocoon is radiated away very rapidly once cooling sets in , we expect that the cocoon remains hot enough to be the source of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect only during the first two phases .",
    "therefore in effect the lifetime of the cocoon can be taken as @xmath86 .    in order to know @xmath87",
    ", we need to evaluate @xmath88 and hence we need to know the cooling processes of the cocoon .",
    "first we examine the content of the cocoon after the jet is off .",
    "the total thermal energy of the cocoon is the sum of that of the jet - supplied matter and of the shock - compressed intergalactic matter . within the model described in the previous sections , the jet - supplied matter and the compressed intergalactic matter",
    "are in pressure equilibrium , and we therefore can not distinguish the former from the latter .",
    "thus we do not know the ratio of the thermal energy of the jet - supplied matter to the total energy .",
    "hereafter we assume that the thermal energy of the shock - compressed matter already dominates that of the jet - supplied matter at the time when the jet stops .",
    "we need to include various cooling processes that affect the temperature behind the shock front , @xmath89 from the discussion of synchrotron spectral aging , the shock speed @xmath45 is estimated to be @xmath90 ( liu et al . 1992 ) .",
    "this result means that @xmath91 is lower than @xmath92 k from equation ( [ tc ] ) .",
    "we can thus ignore pair creation ( @xmath93 ) within the cocoon .",
    "we regard the cocoon matter as a hydrogen plasma ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "the dominant cooling processes within this plasma are thermal bremsstrahlung and inverse compton cooling , and hereafter we take account of these processes for the estimate of @xmath84 .    in figure",
    "[ tr ] , we plot @xmath87 versus redshift . at",
    "higher redshift , inverse compton cooling is more efficient and the cooling time is shorter . as noted above , @xmath79 is about the same order as the jet lifetime @xmath95 years .",
    "this means that when @xmath96 , @xmath97 and no sedov phase would exist . in this case",
    "we set @xmath98 years ( the final result is hardly affected by this value ) . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath99 , @xmath100 and the sedov phase exists .",
    "we make a fitting formula for @xmath87 as a function of redshift :    @xmath101    the thermal energy of the cocoon is expected to decrease rapidly at @xmath102 so we assume    @xmath103    after the jet stops .",
    "in the previous sections , we have obtained all the building blocks for a single cocoon in order to calculate the total @xmath0 .",
    "one remaining parameter is the cocoon number density @xmath23 .",
    "we employ the press - schechter formalism , assuming @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the fraction of radio galaxies among the objects which have mass @xmath18 at @xmath54 . in the next subsection we will model @xmath106 .",
    "as we described in  4 , cocoons can remain hot for a long time . therefore in order to calculate @xmath0 , we should count the `` relics '' of radio galaxies . however",
    ", we do not have any theoretical model of @xmath106 : instead we make a rough estimate of @xmath106 from the present - day luminosity functions of radio galaxies and field galaxies . and",
    "@xmath108 in order to use the results in the literature . ]",
    "first , for radio galaxies , we make use of the local luminosity function of radio sources of condon ( 1989 ) .",
    "his sample contains both the active galaxies with massive black hole ( `` monsters '' ) and starburst galaxies .",
    "but these two types of galaxies cover quite a different range of radio power : most of the extragalactic radio sources with @xmath109w hz@xmath110 are starburst galaxies and most of the sources with @xmath111w hz@xmath110 are `` monsters''(see his figure 9 ; see also sopp & alexander 1991 ) .    next , in order to compare the numbers of radio galaxies with ordinary galaxies , we examine the ( optical luminosity)-(radio power ) relation for radio galaxies .",
    "we employ the data of zirbel & baum ( 1995 ) and plot the @xmath112-absolute @xmath56 magnitude relation . in the table of zirbel & baum ( 1995 ) to calculate @xmath112 from @xmath113 , and when @xmath114 is not displayed in the table , we set @xmath115 . ] from figure [ vradio ] , we can see that there is an upper limit of absolute magnitude @xmath11622 mag though there is a large scatter .",
    "this means that there is a small number of radio galaxies fainter than @xmath11722 mag .",
    "finally , for the luminosity function of field galaxies we adopt the schechter function .",
    "note that usually the schechter function is a function of @xmath118 , not of @xmath119 .",
    "therefore we have to obtain the @xmath119-schechter function .",
    "we include 4 hubble types of galaxies , e / s0 , s@xmath120 , s@xmath121,and s@xmath122 , and adopt the luminosity - averaged local fraction of each types from yosii & takahara ( 1988 ) .",
    "we adopt the value @xmath123 mpc@xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 from yosii & takahara ( 1988 ) , and the averaged @xmath127 colors for each morphological type of galaxies are taken from babul & ferguson ( 1996 ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath119-schechter function is displayed in figure [ vshechter ] .",
    "therefore we obtain a model of the fraction of radio galaxies in terms of    luminosity ,    @xmath128    where @xmath41 is a luminosity function of radio galaxies and @xmath129 is the @xmath119-schechter function .    because we use the mass function of galaxies to count the cocoons , we need @xmath107 as a function of mass . from our observation of figure [ vradio ] that radio galaxies have a lower bound to their optical luminosity",
    ", we further assume that radio galaxies have a lower mass limit corresponding to @xmath11622 mag .",
    "the critical magnitude @xmath130 mag is about the same as @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) , and the lower mass limit to the total ( baryons+dark matter ) mass of a radio galaxy can be taken to be @xmath133 .",
    "it is natural to consider that @xmath107 depends only on masses greater than @xmath134 but moreover we assume that for simplicity @xmath107 is independent of @xmath18 in this mass range .",
    "then we can model @xmath106 as    @xmath135    from the popular idea that the host galaxy of a radio galaxy is a giant elliptical , we set the upper limit on the mass to be @xmath136 .",
    "the physical number density of cocoons is proportional to    @xmath137   \\exp\\left [ -\\frac{\\delta_c^2}{2\\sigma^2d(z)^2}\\right]dm,\\ ] ]    where @xmath138 is the proper density at @xmath54 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 is the growth of the perturbation ( @xmath141 for the einstein - de sitter universe ) , and @xmath142 is the variance with a gaussian filter ,    @xmath143    here @xmath144 is the smoothing radius of the gaussian filter with present critical density @xmath145 , and @xmath146 is the power spectrum of density perturbations . in calculating @xmath146",

    "@xmath150 we use the _",
    "cobe_-normalized value ( sugiyama 1995 ) and approximate @xmath151 with @xmath152 within the range of mass of a radio galaxy . with @xmath153 ,",
    "@xmath154 so we set @xmath155 throughout .",
    "thus the total averaged @xmath0 is given by @xmath156    therefore , @xmath157 if we use equations ( [ pc ] ) and ( [ v ] ) , @xmath158 applying equation ( [ ff ] ) .",
    "we integrate equation ( [ ytot ] ) with @xmath159 and @xmath160 . for the lifetime of the jet we take @xmath161 years regardless of mass .",
    "we obtain ,    @xmath162    as we discussed in  4 , cocoons serve as the source of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect after the jet is off , and the number of the cocoons can be greater than the number of the luminous radio galaxies .",
    "our estimate of @xmath0 should be compared with the _ cobe _ firas constraint @xmath163 ( fixen et al . 1996 ) .",
    "discussions about our result and this constraint are presented in the final section .",
    "we have investigated the sunyaev - zeldovich effect produced by cocoons of radio galaxies .",
    "we have employed a simple model of nath ( 1995 ) while the jet is on .",
    "we have also examined the evolution of a cocoon after the jet turns off , adopting the analogy to the evolution of a supernova remnant in the interstellar medium .",
    "the cocoon remains at high temperature after the jet turns off for over @xmath164 years to low redshift @xmath165 , remaining overpressured against the pressure of the igm .",
    "because of the short lifetime of the jet ( @xmath166 years ) , the main contribution to @xmath0 comes from the cocoons with the jet off . comparing our result with the _ cobe _ constraint we find that hot cocoons could be significant foreground sources of the cmb .",
    "we discuss the assumptions and the implications of the models below .",
    "we have made a model for @xmath106 which is a step function with a cut - off on the upper end of the mass range .",
    "we assumed the lower limit on the mass of a radio galaxy to be @xmath134 from the optical magnitude distribution for radio galaxies , but this value has some ambiguity .",
    "we performed calculations changing the lower mass limit @xmath167 , and found that @xmath0 increases very rapidly with decreasing @xmath167 to exceed the @xmath168 constraint by far .",
    "this might support the view that there exists a low mass limit for jet activity .",
    "in  4 we have presumed that the cocoon remains overpressured against the intergalactic medium .",
    "however , we must investigate the possibility that the pressure of the cocoon decreases to be in pressure equilibrium with the surrounding medium within the effective lifetime of the cocoon @xmath86 .",
    "once in pressure balance with the igm , the internal energy of the cocoon is consumed by @xmath169 work .",
    "we calculate the timescale to be in pressure equilibrium with igm @xmath170 as a function of redshift",
    ". there has not been any direct observational means for obtaining the pressure of the igm . as for the temperature @xmath171 , one can expect @xmath172 k from the previous studies of the reionization of the universe ( see e.g. , fukugita & kawasaki 1994;tegmark , silk , & blanchard 1994 ) . however , radio galaxies or radio loud quasars are likely to be found in high density regions ( jones et al . 1997 ) .",
    "pressure in such an environment is higher than in an ordinary region .",
    "thus we take the temperature of the intergalactic medium @xmath173 to be @xmath174 k , on the order of the present value of the temperature of the intracluster gas . for the number density of igm @xmath175 , as an extreme case",
    ", we equate @xmath175 with the critical density @xmath176 , which is much larger than the average baryon density by a factor of @xmath177 . on the other hand , we make use of the similarity solution for the sedov phase to calculate the pressure behind the shock front . in figure [ tp ]",
    "we plot @xmath170 against redshift @xmath54 . from this figure",
    "we see that the lifetime of a cocoon in a rich cluster of galaxy is shorter than @xmath87 . for the most extreme case , with the electron number density @xmath178cm@xmath124 and the temperature @xmath180k",
    ", @xmath170 is about @xmath181years .",
    "we find that when @xmath182years for @xmath183 , @xmath184 , which is still observable .    for radio luminous galaxies , the radio emission itself may affect the sunyaev - zeldovich decrement . in order to estimate this effect we should take into account the integrated spectrum in a line of sight from cocoons at different redshift . from equations ( 17 ) and ( 33 ) , however , we see that there is marginally one cocoon in one line of sight , which means that the contamination by radio emission from other radio galaxies is not a severe problem .",
    "thus we only have to consider the radio emission accompanying the cocoon itself .",
    "detailed spectrum evolution requires a specific model of radio lobes , though , we just present simple discussions in this paper .    the sunyaev - zeldovich decrement of flux is ( zeldovich & sunyaev , 1969 ) @xmath185 \\cdot y,\\ ] ] with the nondimensional frequency @xmath186 . in the rayleigh - jeans region(@xmath187 ) , @xmath188 which is independent of @xmath189 , and the cmb flux containing sunyaev - zeldovich signal has also black body spectrum . at @xmath190ghz , the spectrum of radio galaxy is @xmath191typically @xmath192 for bright sources ; see sokasian et al .",
    "1998 ) , which is quite different from the cmb spectrum ( @xmath193 ) . as sokasian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) pointed out , bight radio galaxies can be major sources of the anisotropy of cmb especially on subdegree scales at 10ghz@xmath194200ghz , and the sunyaev - zeldovich singal can be completely overcome by the radio emission in this waveband and angular scale while lobes are bright . in the wien region ,",
    "radio emission from radio galaxies becomes increasingly fainter with @xmath195 , and the influence on the deformation of cmb is far weaker than in the rayleigh - jeans region .",
    "thus , one coule consider that the observational prediction of the integrated @xmath0 of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect is significantly contaminated by emission from the lobes in low frequencies .",
    "in such a case , the multiwavelength observation covering a wade range including both rayleigh - jeans and wien region , which planck satellite will carry out , is required in order to detect the sunyaev - zeldovich effect .",
    "however , the effect of radio emission from the lobes depends on the ratio of the timescale of energy loss of the high energy electrons by synchrotron emission and the cocoon effective lifetime(@xmath196 ) .",
    "synchrotron emission from lobes may not fade away immediately after the jet stops , while cocoons can survive for a relatively long period .",
    "if the lifetime of synchrotron emission is significantly shorter than the effective cocoon lifetime , we expect little contamination from radio emission to measure the sunyaev - zeldovich signal in the rayleigh - jeans region .",
    "the loss timescale can be estimated if we know the magnetic field strength and the density of high energy electrons at the lobes .",
    "note that mckinnon , owen , & eilek ( 1991 ) reported the detection of sunyaev - zeldovich decrement from radio jet lobes with nrao 12 m telescope .",
    "the lobe decay time is also closely related to the fraction of high energy electrons @xmath197 ( see below ) .",
    "however , the estimate of the lobe decay time requires a detailed model of radio emitting lobes , and this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in addition to the evolution of the spectrum , the estimate of lobe emission decay time should be regarded as a future work .",
    "radio galaxies have one or two lobes that emit synchrotron radiation from high energy electrons , which are accelerated via fermi acceleration at the shock .",
    "we assumed in the cocoon model that almost all of the jet matter is completely thermalized at the shock , but more realistically speaking , only a fraction @xmath198 of the jet - supplied energy can become the thermal pressure of the cocoon .",
    "therefore @xmath26 in equation ( [ tot ] ) is replaced by @xmath199 and @xmath0 is @xmath200 .",
    "as expressed in  3 , when the jet is stopped by the shock , a large fraction of jet matter would be thermalized ( @xmath201 ) with the magnetic field .",
    "the thermalization efficiency @xmath197 can be estimated if we know the species of the jet particles ( whether they are neutral particles or electron - positron plasma as expected by the central engine of a massive black hole ) and the acceleration mechanism at the shock .",
    "x - ray emission from the lobes , which is considered to be inverse compton scattered synchrotron photons , will provide important information about @xmath197 .",
    "jones et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found the decrement of cmb temperature towards the @xmath202 radio - quiet quasar pair pc1643 + 4631 a and b. there is no detected optical or x - ray source in this direction , and they consider that a low surface brightness cluster of galaxies may be present at relatively high ( @xmath203 ) redshift .",
    "another explanation is suggested by natarajan & sigurdsson ( 1999 ) , who consider that the decrement is the kinematical sunyaev - zeldovich effect produced by quasar winds .",
    "neither explanations seems particularly plausible .",
    "we suggest that the so - called `` black cloud '' phenomenon ( see also richards et al .",
    "1997 ) may be related to the relics of radio galaxies , with the lobes already vanished and with the cocoon still hot enough to give a sizable sunyaev - zeldovich decrement .",
