    "with the discovery of a 125  gev boson at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite , one which behaves uncannily like the massive scalar of the standard model s ( sm ) singular su(2 ) doublet , the question turns to whether an additional scale of physics can be found in a collider environment . a generic way to accommodate",
    "another scale of symmetry breaking is to add an additional scalar field , creating a two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm )  @xcite .",
    "2hdms are commonly associated with supersymmetry ( susy )  @xcite , but they also show up in axion models masking strong cp violation @xcite and baryogenesis @xcite .",
    "2hdm are primarily characterized by @xmath1 ( the ratio of the two vacuum expectation values ) and @xmath3 ( the doublet mixing angle ) .",
    "symmetry breaking produces four scalar higgs bosons ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath2 ) and a pseudo - scalar boson ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "if the fine tuning of the various parameters is minimal , then @xmath4 is the lightest physical particle  @xcite . given that a wide range of measurements have effectively ruled out flavor changing neutral currents at tree - level , realistic 2hdm are restricted to four general models  @xcite , of which two are worth noting here : type - i , where all quarks couple to only one of the doublets , and type - ii , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 couple to opposite doublets ( a requirement of susy ) .",
    "we restrict our attention to type - ii higgs theories .",
    "the sm - like nature of the recently discovered scalar boson ( especially in its per - channel signal strength  @xcite ) , constrains many type - ii 2hdm rather tightly to the alignment limit  @xcite . here , @xmath9 , forcing @xmath10 .",
    ", non - aligned 2hdm are still allowed on a thin trajectory . ]",
    "if there is also a near - degeneracy in the masses of @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath2 , a natural consequence of susy in the decoupling limit  @xcite , then the bosons are kinematically forbidden from decaying to each other .",
    "this mass degeneracy also occurs in more generic 2hdm models which favor natural sm alignment without decoupling ( e.g.  softly broken so(5 )  @xcite ) . as such",
    ", we explore the degenerate mass sector , where the coupling of the heavy charged higgs boson to the standard model is dominated by the heavy third generation .",
    "detecting @xmath11 is difficult as both the signal and background have identical initial and final states ( @xmath12 ) , and the resulting interference gives @xmath13 resonances an unusual shape  @xcite that is easy to mimic with pure qcd .",
    "measuring @xmath13 in association with an additional heavy quark pair eliminates this interference . for a charged higgs boson ,",
    "associated production is the leading order production mode ( @xmath14 ) , where the associated @xmath15 can be resummed into the beam fragments .",
    "this study focuses on the cleaner @xmath16 production channel , as a limit on @xmath17 is effectively a limit on all four 2hdm scalars .",
    "assuming quasi - degeneracy of the heavy higgs masses , one finds  @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 use running quark masses , and @xmath21 are the chiral projection operators .",
    "appealing to naturalness , while simultaneously keeping @xmath22 perturbative ( @xmath23 ) , leads to the expectation that @xmath24 which corresponds to @xmath25 at @xmath26 . at the center of this region @xmath27",
    "lies a `` wedge '' of low production cross section , where the coupling transitions from top - dominated at low @xmath1 to a bottom - dominated at large @xmath1 .",
    "the wedge obfuscates the investigation of a large swath of interesting parameter space , as is quite evident in recent experimental searches for @xmath2 using 8 tev lhc data  @xcite .",
    "the situation should improve in lhc run 2 , but the predictions range from slightly pessimistic for @xmath28@xmath29  @xcite to quite optimistic for @xmath28@xmath30  @xcite .",
    "it is our assessment that the variations in previous estimates are primarily due to choices made when simulating a standard `` track - vertex '' @xmath15 tag to suppress qcd background .",
    "this becomes more difficult as the mass of the charged higgs moves above a tev , as the bottom quark become significantly boosted , making theoretical predictions sensitive to careful modeling of real - world tagging efficiencies .    in this work",
    ", we predict the experimental reach for @xmath31 through its associated production with a top quark , and its decay to boosted top and boosted bottom jets , in both a generic two higgs double model and in susy . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cuts ] we describe our selection cuts and tagging efficiencies in the boosted regime . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we present our numerical results for the lhc at 14  tev .",
    "we find that the lhc has limited reach to observe a charged higgs boson , and so extend our examination to show the reach of a 100  tev future circular collider ( fcc ) .",
    "given the disparity between previous predictions for the reconstruction of @xmath32 at large charged higgs boson mass , this study concentrates on careful modeling of boosted bottom jets at the lhc and at a fcc . in this section , we address improvements to our existing @xmath33 boosted - bottom - jet tag , and detail improvements to signal selection over previous studies .",
    "track - vertex tags use multivariate information from charged particle tracks to detect a @xmath34 hadron decay vertex displaced from the interaction point . for jet @xmath35 ,",
    "such tags have high @xmath15-jet efficiency ( @xmath36 ) and excellent light jet fake rates ( @xmath37 )  @xcite , making them the primary method for @xmath15 jet tagging at the lhc .",
    "this performance deteriorates as jets approach the tev regime .",
    "a highly boosted @xmath15 jet has tracks which are relatively straight and very collimated , degrading their individual reconstruction efficiency .",
    "additionally , the average number of tracks from the bottom hadron itself is fixed by branching ratios ; it does not depend on jet @xmath38 .",
    "thus , as tracking performance degrades for tev jets , it becomes easier to miss the limited number of @xmath15 hadron tracks .",
    "conversely , the average number of tracks inside a jet increases with @xmath38 , since more fragmentation produces more particles .",
    "so as light jets ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) become harder , it is easier to find some combination of tracks which _ fake _ a displaced vertex  @xcite .",
    "this exacerbates the falling signal efficiency with a rising fake rate , driving @xmath43 even lower .",
    "hence , a common scheme in phenomenological studies  treating the nominal @xmath15-tag efficiency and fake rate as constant across all @xmath44  can lead to over - optimistic predictions for tev - scale physics .",
    "these realities spurred the development of the @xmath0 boosted - bottom - jet tag @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 tag is essentially an angular cut between a muon ( from semi - leptonic @xmath15 hadron decay ) and the highly collimated jet `` core '' ( the boosted remnants of the @xmath45 hadron , along with collinear fragmentation from the @xmath15 quark ) .",
    "the @xmath33 tag has been implemented in a public code for use with fast detector simulators  @xcite . while the maximum @xmath15-tagging efficiency of @xmath0 is limited by the overall branching ratio of semi - muonic @xmath15-hadron decay ( @xmath46 ) ,",
    "its main virtue is that its signal efficiency ( @xmath47 ) and fake rate ( @xmath48 ) are flat as a function of jet @xmath38 once boosted kinematics turn on ( @xmath49 above 500  gev ) .",
    "previously , we implemented the @xmath0 tag by utilizing the resolution of the electromagnetic calorimeter and avoided using tracks  @xcite . in the present study",
    ", we improve upon our prior implementation by allowing @xmath0 to access high - resolution angular information in tracks to locate the jet core , then calculate the muon opening angle . while we find that combining tracking with normal - resolution calorimetry does not change the tagging efficiency at 14  tev , tracking becomes absolutely essential at 100  tev . the large radius  ( 6  m ) and strong magnetic field  ( 6  t ) of the hypothetical fcc tracking system  @xcite smears the charged constituents in  @xmath50 , reducing the correlation between charged tracks and multi - tev tower jets .",
    "there are two major production modes for @xmath51 at a proton collider : the `` @xmath52 '' final state @xmath53 ( with @xmath54 ) , and the `` @xmath55 '' final state @xmath56 . since the @xmath55 final state is the dominant mode , accounting for at least 60% of the total cross section for all masses , the inclusive ( @xmath55 + @xmath52 ) final state is a natural starting point .",
    "this requires tagging a boosted bottom jet and two tops : a boosted top jet from the @xmath17 decay , and a much softer , resolvable , associated top .    using the @xmath0 tag to identify the boosted-@xmath15 jet unavoidably selects events containing hard neutrinos from semi - leptonic @xmath57 hadron decay .",
    "this smears the missing energy of any leptonically decaying tops , reducing the effectiveness of @xmath58 for top identification or reconstruction , and limiting @xmath17 mass resolution if the boosted top decays leptonically .",
    "these limitations are easily side - stepped by using only the fully hadronic decay of the boosted top , tagging the unique shape of @xmath59 merged into a single `` fat '' jet  @xcite .",
    "conversely , the associated top is slow enough to be resolved into isolated daughters , so its fully hadronic final state is quite susceptible to qcd background .",
    "it is safer to resolve the associated top into an isolated lepton ( @xmath60 ) and a @xmath15 jet ( which is soft enough that high - efficiency track tags remain robust ) .",
    "the @xmath61 portion of the inclusive final state provides multiple handles to suppress pure multijet background , leaving @xmath62 the dominant background ( where @xmath63 ) .",
    "here , the light flavored jet is both hard and `` mis - tagged '' as a primary boosted-@xmath15 jet .",
    "this usually occurs when the jet showers @xmath64 , creating a real @xmath57-hadron inside a jet of light - flavor origin .",
    "the sub - dominant background is @xmath65  effectively the same final state , but with the gluon splitting at a much higher scale .",
    "other final states ( e.g.  @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) are found to be negligible .",
    "event reconstruction begins with jet reconstruction .",
    "first , `` narrow '' jets are clustered using an anti-@xmath68 algorithm with @xmath69 @xcite , and `` fat '' jets are clustered using a cambridge - aachen algorithm with @xmath70 @xcite . both boosted jets must have @xmath71 , and all jets must have @xmath72 for 14(100 ) tev collisions . additionally , all jets must have @xmath73 , so that the edge of the tracker lies outside the clustering radius of narrow jets .",
    "we require exactly one isolated lepton with @xmath74  gev .",
    "the lepton is considered isolated if @xmath75 for all tracks and towers within a cone of @xmath76 , as prescribed in a recent experimental search  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the lepton can not fall within a @xmath77 cone surrounding any of the candidate jets .",
    "narrow jets are sorted by @xmath38 ( high to low ) , and the first narrow jet which is @xmath0 tagged becomes the boosted @xmath15 candidate .",
    "to exclude the situation where the boosted top decays leptonically ( and the associated top hadronically ) , we require that the boosted-@xmath15 plus lepton system has a mass inconsistent with a top quark ( @xmath78 ) . this cut is primarily used to properly model the @xmath62 background , but is redundant in other systems because it effectively overlaps the requirement that the lepton reside outside of the boosted-@xmath15 jet .",
    "next , fat jets are sorted by @xmath38 , and the first one which has a boosted hadronic top tag is the boosted top candidate .",
    "we then require that @xmath79 and @xmath80 for the two boosted candidates .",
    "the latter cut is used to restrict @xmath81-channel background from hardening the tail of the @xmath82 distribution , although it removes about a fifth of all @xmath17 ( whose isotropic decay is minimally boosted in the transverse direction , due to its large mass ) .",
    "we do not impose any constraints on the mass of the boosted top jet , as these are already built into the boosted top tag efficiency .",
    "we then attempt to reconstruct the associated top by finding a @xmath15 jet compatible with the isolated lepton . from the set of narrow jets whose",
    "@xmath38 is smaller than the boosted @xmath15 , we take at most two jets which are @xmath15-tagged and reside outside an @xmath83 cone around the boosted top ( which should contain its own @xmath15 jet ) .",
    "we then attempt to find a @xmath15-lepton system with @xmath38 less than the boosted top , and an invariant mass consistent with a top quark missing its neutrino ( @xmath84 , where the slightly elevated ceiling permits detector smearing ) .",
    "if two @xmath15 candidates pass these cuts , the one whose @xmath85 is above 110  gev is selected ; if both are above 110  gev , the one which is closer to 110  gev is selected .",
    "the total branching ratio of the hadronic / leptonic @xmath61 decay ( 14% ) , combined with the efficiency of the two boosted flavor tags ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) and the event shape cuts for the inclusive final state , produce an overall @xmath17 acceptance of @xmath88 .",
    "the qcd background acceptance is an order of magnitude lower , though a more important consideration is the ratio of @xmath89 to @xmath65 . for the inclusive cuts , the ratio is consistently about 5:1 , which is small enough that there is no clear benefit to independently reconstructing the @xmath52 final state , as was previously done @xcite , since the process is already signal constrained at the lhc",
    "we calculate all cross sections using a generic 2hdm from feynrules  @xcite with madgraph  5  v2.3.3  @xcite and the ct14llo parton distribution functions  @xcite .",
    "events are showered and hadronized using pythia 8.210 @xcite , and reconstructed using ` fastjet `  3.1.3  @xcite and the delphes  3  @xcite detector simulation .",
    "for the 14  tev analysis , we modify the atlas card supplied with delphes to simulate the @xmath0 boosted @xmath15 tag ( using the ` muxboostedbtag ` module available on github  @xcite ) . both the track - based @xmath15 tag and the boosted top tag are applied using a functional form of the tagging efficiency based upon jet @xmath38 . for the track - vertex @xmath15 tag , we use the run  2 efficiency from the atlas card ( based upon ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and for the top tag , we use the efficiencies depicted in ref .",
    "@xcite , which closely match those given in more recent publications  @xcite . at 100  tev",
    ", we use the fcc card supplied with delphes ( again modified to simulated @xmath0 ) , with two major changes : ( i )  we use the same track - vertex @xmath15 tagging efficiency formula used for 14  tev and ( ii )  we use a more conservative tracking domain ( @xmath90 ) .    at both collider energies",
    ", we use delphes `` eflow '' objects ( which subtracts track energy from the calorimeter towers they strike , after both tracks and towers have their energy smeared ) .",
    "we then cluster jets from tracks ( minus isolated leptons ) and track - subtracted towers . to estimate the neutrino @xmath58 inherent to the @xmath0 tag , we simply double the momentum of the tagging muon  @xcite .",
    "this does a reasonably effective job of reconstructing the @xmath17 peak , allowing us to use a mass window of @xmath91\\times m_{h^{\\pm}}$ ] at both 14 and 100  tev to capture the majority of the signal . without neutrino estimation ,",
    "the @xmath17 peak has a noticeably longer low - mass tail .",
    "we first explore the reach for a charged higgs boson produced in association with a top quark for a generic 2hdm .",
    "we convert the leading order @xmath93 used by madgraph to a next - to - leading order @xmath93 by using the running quark masses at one - loop in qcd @xcite , which shifts the center of the @xmath1 wedge upwards . in fig .",
    "[ fig : exclusion-14 ] , we show the 95% confidence level ( c.l . ) limit for @xmath17 exclusion at a 14  tev lhc with 300 or 3000  @xmath94 of data . in order to compare directly with refs .",
    "@xcite , we show ( a ) the limit obtainable on the effective yukawa coupling @xmath95 , and ( b ) the corresponding region of @xmath1 probed .",
    "it turns out that the only yukawa couplings @xmath95 or values of @xmath1 that can be probed at the lhc are on the border of the non - perturbative regions of parameter space .",
    "the accessible region of parameter space at the lhc is entirely limited by the production cross section , as @xmath96 across the entire mass range . because the @xmath97 cross section at 14  tev is quite small",
    ", the reach in @xmath1 is poor at the lhc .",
    "once @xmath98 surpasses 2  tev , the @xmath17 begins to grow noticeably off - shell , which weakens the narrow width approximation we use to extrapolate from our working value of @xmath1 to the 95% limit .",
    "the loss of reach approaching 1  tev is due to signal / background attenuation ; a combination of the 350  gev minimum @xmath38 cut imposed on both boosted jets and the swiftly diminishing efficiency of both boosted flavor tags below 500  gev . given the presence of this feature , our results are consistent with extending the predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite into the tev regime .",
    "charged higgs bosons are unlikely to be observed at the lhc .",
    "the @xmath99 cross section is strongly dependent on collider energy .",
    "a 100 tev collider , such as a fcc , promises significantly more reach for charged higgs bosons . at 100  tev ,",
    "the reach becomes background limited , with @xmath43 rising from @xmath100 at 1  tev to @xmath101 at 6  tev . in fig .",
    "[ fig : exclusion-100 ] we observed that the reach in effective yukawa coupling is an order - of - magnitude better than at the lhc .",
    "this allows the wedge region to close as the integrated luminosity rises above 3  @xmath102 up to a charged higgs mass of 2  tev . while this analysis is robust , more sophisticated techniques",
    " boosted decision trees ( bdt ) or neural nets ( nn )  might improve the reach .",
    "however , since bdt / nn techniques are highly dependent on the quality of the observables with which they train , it is difficult to make accurate predictions this far from a realized 100  tev detector system , especially using a fast detector simulator .",
    "regardless , our results suggest that search for tev - scale charged higgs bosons is the domain of future colliders .",
    "one - loop corrections in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) modify the fermionic couplings to @xmath17 bosons .",
    "the effect is most significant for the bottom quark  @xcite , and can be absorbed into the yukawa coupling as @xmath103 ( here we ignore supersymmetric electroweak corrections , using only those from supersymmetric qcd ) .",
    "@xmath104 explicitly depends on the the gluino mass , the mass of the two bottom squark eigenstates and @xmath105 , the mass parameter coefficient of the @xmath106 term in the superpotential . in the quasi - degenerate limit , where all these mass parameters are of equal size , only the sign of @xmath105 survives  @xcite . at large @xmath1 ( @xmath107 @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the heavy susy scale ( which we take to be 10  tev , although the result is not heavily dependent upon the choice of @xmath109 , since @xmath110 runs slowly above a few tev ) .    comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : exclusion - susy-14 ] to fig .",
    "[ fig : exclusion-14 ] , it is readily apparent that the @xmath111 correction has a significant impact on the reach at 14  tev , where the production cross section is so small that only very large @xmath1 are accessible . for a positive @xmath105 ,",
    "the @xmath104 correction counteracts the cross section enhancement of large @xmath1 , shifting high @xmath1 parameter space completely out of reach .",
    "conversely , the negative @xmath105 correction enhances the cross section beyond the generic 2hdm in a small region of @xmath112 , but decreases it at larger values of @xmath1 . at small values of @xmath113 ,",
    "the top - quark yukawa becomes so large the theory is non - perturbative . if charged higgs boson searches are difficult at the lhc in a generic 2hdm , in susy they are nearly impossible .",
    "in stark contrast , fig .",
    "[ fig : exclusion - susy-100 ] shows that the effect of @xmath104 is noticeable at a 100  tev collider , but it manifests only as a moderate shift in the upper bound of the wedge , without a dramatic change in shape .",
    "this serves to underline the nature of the @xmath104 effect ; for a _ signal limited _ search ( 14  tev ) , it is very important , while for a _ background limited _ search ( 100  tev ) it is more - or - less negligible .",
    "the lack of sensitivity to susy corrections at 100  tev demonstrates the low model dependence in the reach for charged higgs bosons at a future collider .",
    "we examine the predicted experimental reach for charged higgs bosons in @xmath114 at both the lhc and at a 100  tev future collider , using a type - ii two higgs doublet model with mass degenerate heavy higgs bosons . in the limit where @xmath2 couples mostly to @xmath115 , we find that the lhc has access only to relatively large effective yukawa couplings @xmath93 when @xmath116  confirming and extending the expectations from ref .",
    "@xcite . additionally , we find that supersymmetric corrections to the bottom yukawa coupling are large , and further reduce sensitivity to a mssm charged higgs boson at the lhc .",
    "these findings indicate that a next - generation collider will probably be necessary to examine tev - scale charged higgs bosons that couple strongly to the third generation of quarks . in comparison to more optimistic predictions  @xcite ,",
    "we stress the importance of using realistic @xmath15-tagging efficiencies @xcite in phenomenological predictions covering tev - scale physics .",
    "our particular choice of 2hdm ( type - ii with degenerate masses ) ensures that @xmath117 is the only pertinent coupling .",
    "a less restrictive model ( e.g.  where @xmath2 couples to charm @xcite ) , or one with alternate decay channels , such as @xmath118 , may still be visible at the lhc given sufficient integrated luminosity . in those cases",
    ", one can convert our limit on @xmath93 to a limit on cross - section times branching fraction for the channel @xmath114 in those models .",
    "finally , we find a 100  tev proton collider has the potential to close the moderate @xmath1 `` wedge '' region below 2  tev .",
    "while the charged higgs - top associated channel will be background limited at such a machine , charged higgs bosons with masses up to 6  tev can be probed with very little dependence on model parameters ( such as the sign of the @xmath105-parameter in susy ) .",

    "<S> two higgs doublet extensions of the standard model , such as supersymmetry , predict the existence of charged higgs bosons . we explore the reach for tev - scale charged higgs bosons through their associated production with top quarks , and their decay to boosted top jets and @xmath0-tagged boosted bottom jets , at a 14  tev cern large hadron collider and at a 100  tev future circular collider . in particular , we show the moderate @xmath1 `` wedge '' region of parameter space can not be probed at the large hadron collider for tev - scale @xmath2 because the cross section is too small . however </S>",
