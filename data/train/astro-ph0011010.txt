    "it is widely accepted nowadays that cosmic rays ( crs ) with energies per particle up to about @xmath3  ev are protons and nuclei of galactic origin .",
    "furthermore , it is well established that the full cr energy spectrum has a power - law behavior with a steepening taking place at the so - called knee , corresponding to an energy @xmath4  ev .",
    "although it is well known that the cr composition below the knee has a significant heavy component , its behavior beyond the knee remains somewhat controversial .",
    "indeed , above @xmath5  ev / nucleus the information about the cr mass composition has to be drawn from extensive air shower observations at ground level with the results from different experiments not always being compatible .",
    "moreover , the theoretical predictions depend on the hadronic model adopted and this can introduce further uncertainties on the inferred composition .",
    "the model dependence in certain observables can however be useful to discriminate among the hadronic models using the experimental data , and in this comparison qgsjet and venus turn indeed to be favoured against other models such as sibyll @xcite .",
    "thus , the cr mass composition beyond the knee is not definitively established yet , with some observations @xcite suggesting that it turns lighter and others instead suggesting that the heavier components become dominant @xcite .",
    "the attempts made so far to explain the physical origin of the knee of the cosmic ray spectrum can be roughly classified into three kind of models .",
    "one of them exploits the possibility that the acceleration mechanisms could be less effective above the knee @xcite , while a second one assumes that leakage from the galaxy plays the dominant role in suppressing crs above the knee @xcite .",
    "the third scenario , originally proposed by hillas @xcite , considers nuclear photodisintegration processes ( and proton energy losses by photomeson production ) , in the presence of a background of optical and soft uv photons in the source region , as the main responsible for the change in the cr spectrum .",
    "the first two scenarios are based on a rigidity dependent effect which consequently produces a change in the spectral slope of each nuclear component with charge @xmath6 at an energy @xmath7 .",
    "hence , it removes first the protons and the lighter nuclei and only at larger energies affects the heavier nuclei , predicting that the cr mass composition should become heavier beyond the knee . on the contrary ,",
    "the third scenario predicts a lighter cr composition above the knee due to the disintegration of the propagating nuclei .",
    "the predictions of this last scenario have been worked out by karakula and tkaczyk @xcite some years ago .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to re - evaluate in detail the propagation of nuclei and protons in the source region following their approach , but taking into account some additional features that turn out to be important for the determination of the source parameters required for the scenario to work . in particular",
    ", we re - evaluate the nuclear photodisintegration rates taking into account multinucleon emission processes , we introduce more accurate threshold energies in the giant dipole resonance for every stable nucleus ( according to recent remarks by stecker and salamon @xcite ) , and discuss the impact of the neutron mechanism @xcite which would allow the escape of neutrons from the source without further energy losses .",
    "moreover , we show that by introducing a non negligible lower cutoff to the power - law photon distribution , the abrupt suppression of the all - particle cr spectrum above @xmath8  ev previously obtained @xcite is prevented , and hence the underlying reason for that effect is identified .",
    "let us also mention that although we focus our study here on the scenario proposed to explain the observed steepening at the knee , we expect that our general considerations about the treatment of photodisintegration processes should also be relevant in other contexts .",
    "as already mentioned , we deal with a model that considers that the cr nuclei are accelerated inside discrete sources which are surrounded by a very strong background of optical and soft uv photons . if the typical energy of the photons is in the optical range ( @xmath9 ev ) , the photodisintegration of cr nuclei will start to be efficient at cr energies @xmath10  ev .",
    "this is so because in the cr rest frame the optical photon ( which is boosted by a relativistic factor @xmath11 ) appears as an energetic gamma ray with @xmath12  mev , i.e. capable of photodisintegrating the nucleus .",
    "hence , the basic assumption is that the cr spectrum emitted by the source is a featureless extrapolation of the spectra measured below the knee and that the observed change in slope is actually due to the cr interactions ( i.e. the process of nuclear photodisintegration and the photopion production by protons ) with the surrounding photon background .",
    "we then assume that the source emits nuclei with mass number @xmath13 ( with @xmath13 ranging from 1 to 56 ) .",
    "since there is only one stable isotope for a nucleus of a given mass @xmath13 along most of the decay chain from @xmath14fe to @xmath15h , we take for definiteness a unique charge @xmath6 associated to any given value of @xmath13 .",
    "the differential fluxes emitted by the source are assumed to be given by power - law distributions    @xmath16    ( where @xmath17 throughout ) .",
    "the intensities @xmath18 and spectral indices @xmath19 were taken from the detailed knowledge about cr mass composition below the knee ( for energies per particle above @xmath20  ev ) @xcite .",
    "for the photon background that surrounds the source we consider that its spectrum follows either a ( thermal ) planckian - type distribution given by    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the boltzmann",
    "constant , @xmath23 the absolute temperature and @xmath24 the riemann zeta function ( such that @xmath25 ) , or a power - law distribution given by    @xmath26    where @xmath27 , @xmath28 are the lower and upper energy cutoffs and @xmath29 the assumed spectral index . for both distributions",
    ", @xmath30 represents the total number density and @xmath31 the differential number density corresponding to a photon energy @xmath32 . defining @xmath33 as the total energy density ,",
    "one has for the planckian spectrum    @xmath34    while the analogous expression for the power - law spectrum is    @xmath35    we adopt @xmath36 as in ref .",
    "@xcite , but the introduction of a non negligible lower cutoff @xmath27 in the power - law spectrum excludes the presence of an abundant number of low energy ( infrared ) photons that would otherwise play the dominant role in the photodisintegration above @xmath8  ev , as was the case in ref .",
    "regarding the spatial dependence of the radiation background we do not make any particular assumption , but the results will depend only on the integrated photon column density along the trajectory of the cr since its production at the source until it leaves the region filled with radiation .",
    "the main mechanism of energy loss for nuclei with energy per particle below @xmath3  ev propagating through these photon backgrounds is the process of photodisintegration .",
    "in fact , a nucleus of mass @xmath37 and lorentz factor @xmath38 that propagates through a photon distribution @xmath31 ( as , for example , those of eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) ) has a probability of fission with emission of @xmath39 nucleons given by    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the corresponding photodisintegration cross section , @xmath32 the photon energy in the observer s system and @xmath42 its energy in the rest frame of the nucleus . in order to calculate @xmath43 we fitted @xmath41 with the parameters given in tables i and ii of ref .",
    "@xcite , while the reaction thresholds @xmath44 were taken from table  i of ref .",
    "a useful quantity to take into account all reaction channels is the effective emission rate given by    @xmath45    at low energies ( @xmath46 mev ) , the cross section @xmath47 is dominated by the giant dipole resonance and the photodisintegration proceeds chiefly by the emission of one or two nucleons .",
    "note that , according to recent remarks pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , we employ threshold energies that depend both on the nucleus and on the number of emitted nucleons .",
    "the improvement consists in shifting the threshold energy , that was previously assumed to be @xmath48  mev for all reaction channels and all nuclei @xcite , to higher energies , such that single - nucleon emission has now a typical threshold of @xmath49  mev , while the double - nucleon emission energy threshold becomes typically @xmath50  mev . although the appearance of the knee in this scenario is ultimately a threshold effect , the improved calculation including the change in the specific threshold energies has however a minor impact on the resulting emission rates when compared with those obtained with a fixed threshold energy @xmath51 mev .",
    "this can be appreciated in figure 1 , where plots of @xmath52 vs energy per nucleon @xmath53 are shown for a @xmath14fe nucleus ( @xmath54 ) propagating through a thermal photon spectrum ( with @xmath55 ev ) .",
    "the emission rate @xmath56 ( calculated with the specific threshold energies ) shows a small shift towards higher energies with respect to that obtained by means of the fixed threshold energy ( labeled @xmath57 ) .",
    "the reason for this reduced effect of the threshold shifts is that the dominant photodisintegration effects are due anyhow to the energies around the giant resonance peak , which for single - nucleon emission are typically peaked around @xmath50  mev and for double - nucleon emission around @xmath58  mev , and hence clearly well above the threshold energies .",
    "= 3.0 in    at higher energies , @xmath47 is approximately flat and the multinucleon emission acquires a higher probability , becoming actually dominant for heavy nuclei , for which the probability for single nucleon emission is of only @xmath59 . to estimate the relevance of multinucleon emission processes , we compare the effective rate from eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) with the emission rate that neglects multinucleon processes ( as calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . figure 2(a ) shows plots of @xmath52 versus energy per nucleon @xmath53 for a @xmath14fe nucleus ( @xmath54 ) propagating through a thermal photon spectrum ( with @xmath60  ev ) . from the figure it becomes evident that multinucleon processes play an important role , increasing the emission rate at high energies by a factor of @xmath61 with respect to the single nucleon emission results .",
    "analogously , figure 2(b ) shows the corresponding plots for a power - law photon spectrum with upper energy cutoff @xmath62  ev and spectral index @xmath63 . from this figure",
    "we can also see the effect of introducing a non negligible lower cutoff in the spectrum .",
    "in fact , we observe that with a negligible cutoff ( e.g. @xmath64  ev ) the emission rate grows steadily , because increasingly abundant low energy ( infrared ) photons give in this case the dominant contribution to the rates .",
    "they also keep the influence of the giant resonance dominant even at high particle energies , and hence in this case the multinucleon emission has little impact .",
    "however , if we take a non negligible cutoff into account ( for instance , @xmath65 ev ) , we find that the flat high energy regime of @xmath66 now dominates beyond a given value of @xmath53 and hence the emission rate saturates at high energies . comparing the two emission rate curves with non negligible cutoff , we observe again that multinucleon emission processes lead to a significant increase ( by the same factor of @xmath61 we already encountered ) in the emission rate .",
    "thus , introducing a non negligible lower cutoff energy in the power - law photon spectrum the results should not differ much from those with the thermal photon spectrum and , being the rates with multinucleon emission larger , they should also require smaller photon densities than those previously estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite to produce similar overall effects .",
    "= 3.0 in    = 3.0 in    it should be noticed that in figures 1 and 2 we have chosen to plot the emission rates as functions of the energy per nucleon @xmath53 , instead of energy per nucleus @xmath67 , because it is @xmath53 that remains constant during photodisintegration and also because for different nuclei the shapes of the cross section are similar with the maxima occurring approximately at the same values of @xmath53 .",
    "the equations that describe the propagation of nuclei are :    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the differential flux of a nucleus of mass @xmath37 ( for @xmath70 ) with an energy per nucleon @xmath71 at propagation distance @xmath72 from the source , @xmath73 is the above defined emission rate and @xmath74 is the kronecker delta .",
    "the exact solution of these equations ( i.e. , the differential fluxes at propagation distance @xmath75 ) is given by :    @xmath76    where    @xmath77    and    @xmath78    recalling that the emission rates @xmath43 are linear in the photon energy density @xmath33 , it should be noted that , as expected , the fluxes only depend on the column density @xmath79 .",
    "it also should be pointed out that , since the equations describing the cr propagation only depend on the energies per nucleon @xmath71 , the final cr spectra require the re - calculation of the solution ( eqs.(9)-(11 ) ) in terms of energy per nucleus .",
    "the main energy loss mechanism that must be taken into account for the propagation of protons is the photomeson production process .",
    "we have to distinguish between the primary protons produced at the source with an initial flux @xmath80 ( as given by eq.(1 ) ) and the nucleons released as by - products of the nuclear photodisintegration . the fluxes corresponding to these ( secondary ) protons and neutrons ( @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively )",
    "can be easily determined from the solution for the nuclear fluxes , as we will see in the following .",
    "let @xmath83 be the differential flux of nucleons of energy @xmath67 produced within a distance @xmath72 away from the source by the photodisintegration of nuclei of mass number @xmath37 and energy per nucleon @xmath84 .",
    "then , the equation governing the evolution of the fluxes is    @xmath85    ( with the initial condition @xmath86 ) and its solution reads    @xmath87 \\ \\ .\\ ] ]    thus , the total fluxes of secondary protons and neutrons are found by performing the weighted sums over index @xmath88 :    @xmath89    @xmath90    where @xmath91 is the charge of the @xmath88-nucleus .",
    "we will also discuss the possible impact of the so - called neutron mechanism@xcite , which could take place in the presence of a magnetic field in the source region .",
    "indeed , a magnetic field would retain the charged particles within that region for some period of time , while non - charged particles would be able to escape rapidly . in that case",
    ", we will consider that the flux of neutrons @xmath82 adds to the final all - particle cr flux neglecting any energy losses , while the flux of secondary protons @xmath81 , combined with the initial flux of primary protons @xmath80 , will undergo energy losses due to the well studied process of photopion production . indeed , since a background photon looks like a high - energy gamma ray in the proton rest frame , the photopion reactions    @xmath92    @xmath93    proceed with an interaction probability given by    @xmath94    where , analogously to eq .",

    "the energy threshold for photopion production is @xmath99 mev .",
    "then , if we call @xmath100 and @xmath101 the differential fluxes of protons and neutrons of energy @xmath67 ( produced by the reactions given by eqs.(16 ) and ( 17 ) , respectively ) after tarversing a distance @xmath72 from the source , the corresponding propagation equations are    @xmath102    and ( neglecting neutron energy losses )    @xmath103    where the factors @xmath104 arise from the relative probability of occurrence of reactions ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) .",
    "the coefficient of inelasticity @xmath98 was given a typical value @xmath105 , irrespective of proton energy @xcite .",
    "the initial conditions to solve these differential equations are    @xmath106    and    @xmath107    respectively . in the first one we assumed for simplicity that the secondary protons produced by photodisintegration of nuclei add directly to the initial proton spectrum .",
    "this is justified since whenever the photopion processes are relevant , the photodisintegration is very efficient and hence nuclei are rapidly disintegrated .",

    "so far , we wrote down the appropriate equations governing the propagation of cr particles , and we found their exact solutions : eqs.(9)-(11 ) for nuclei , eqs.(13),(15 ) and ( 26)-(28 ) for neutrons ( that eventually decay into protons outside the source region ) , and eqs.(23)-(25 ) for protons ( that undergo energy losses due to photopion production ) , the sum of all these contributions being the total cr flux @xmath118 . we can now investigate how @xmath118 depends on the assumed photon distributions around the source , namely on the column density @xmath79 and on the parameters involved in the photon spectral distributions ( eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) ) .",
    "figure 3(a ) shows the total cr differential flux as a function of the energy per particle for a planckian spectrum with @xmath60 ev and several values for the column density @xmath79 .",
    "analogously , figure 3(b ) shows the results corresponding to a planckian spectrum with @xmath55 ev . to compare our results with experimental data ,",
    "the figures also show the observed spectra measured by different experiments ( casablanca , dice , tibet , proton satellite and akeno ) @xcite .",
    "= 3.0 in    = 3.0 in    the effect of increasing the temperature is clearly that of shifting the knee towards lower energies , while the effect of increasing @xmath79 is that of intensifying the steepening at the knee .",
    "this behavior is easily explained by the fact that it is the nuclear photodisintegration the responsible for the occurrence of the knee ( since photopion production processes show up at higher energies ) .",
    "then , if the photon temperature ( and thus , the mean photon energy ) is larger , the particle energy required for the nuclei to disintegrate decreases .",
    "furthermore , cr propagation can not be affected by @xmath79 below the knee , where the photodisintegration has not set up yet , but above the knee the disintegration rates have a linear dependence on @xmath33 .",
    "hence , we should expect @xmath79 to control the steepening in the knee region , in agreement with the results shown in the figures .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the best fit to observations for the planckian spectrum was that corresponding to @xmath60  ev and @xmath119  ev/@xmath1 .",
    "for the sake of comparison , figure 3(a ) shows our results for the same temperature .",
    "it is clearly observed that the new results are compatible with the akeno experimental data for low column density values @xmath120",
    "ev/@xmath1 , i.e. @xmath121 times lower than the previous result .",
    "figure 3(b ) shows that the corresponding results for @xmath55  ev are in somewhat better agreement with casablanca observations for column densities in the range @xmath122  ev/@xmath1 .",
    "one has to keep in mind however that the model discussed is oversimplified in many respects : we assume that the same photon column density is traversed by all nuclear species and for all cr energies , we neglect additional effects due to change in diffusion properties at these energies , which in alternative scenarios @xcite are actually the responsible for the appearance of the knee , we assume that cr interactions in the interstellar medium are negligible , etc .. hence , an accurate agreement with observational data is not to be expected , although it is reassuring to see that the results have the right tendency to account for the main qualitative features of the data in the knee region .    figures 4(a ) and 4(b ) show plots of mean mass composition @xmath123 versus @xmath67 corresponding to the planckian photon spectra with @xmath124  ev and @xmath125  ev , respectively . for comparison , we also show the cr mass composition measured by different experiments @xcite",
    ". one can observe that solutions corresponding to the largest plotted values of column density @xmath79 imply that crs above the knee are chiefly constituted by protons , in disagreement with experimental data ; the non - negligible contribution of heavier cr components beyond the knee imposes an upper limit on the column density around @xmath126  ev/@xmath1 .",
    "this result stresses again the fact that multinucleon emission processes play a significant role in cr propagation within this scenario .",
    "we also see that , although the solutions with lower column density ( @xmath127 ) are in reasonable agreement with some data sets within error bars , the composition beyond the knee seems to be somewhat suppressed .",
    "nevertheless , we should bear in mind that we have employed just one source with a fixed column density , and that in a realistic situation there would be many sources , each with a different environment of radiation . avoiding any detailed calculations , we may think about the contribution of one additional source . if it happens to have a column density @xmath79 somewhat smaller , it would lead to a flatter flux ; then , whereas the first source would be responsible for the occurrence of the knee , the second one would keep a non - vanishing nuclear component beyond the knee .",
    "furthermore , in the computations we assumed that all nuclei traverse the same distance @xmath75 , thus disregarding the fact that the magnetic field present in the source region should retain more effectively the heavier nuclei at any given cr energy . taking this into account ( for instance , assuming that a nucleus traverses a distance in the photon background proportional to its charge ) we would find that , while the disintegration would be very effective for heavy nuclei ( and would be , in fact , responsible for forming the knee ) , it would be less effective for the lighter nuclei ( since the column density for them would be much smaller ) and they could then survive beyond the knee .",
    "hence , we see that this scenario can easily account for a change in the composition towards lighter nuclei above the knee , which is apparent in some of the existing data . on the contrary ,",
    "rigidity dependent scenarios predict the opposite trend , and may have difficulties to account for some measurements .",
    "it has indeed been pointed out that they would require the introduction of an ad - hoc additional light component above the knee to reproduce the observations @xcite .",
    "= 3.0 in    = 3.0 in    the results for the power - law photon spectrum ( with a lower cutoff energy in the infrared range ) should not differ much from the ones obtained for the planckian spectrum , and this behavior was in fact corroborated .",
    "let us fix the spectral index and the upper cutoff energy at the values found in ref .",
    "@xcite to correspond to the best fit to experimental data , namely @xmath128 and @xmath129  ev .",
    "figure 5 shows @xmath118 versus @xmath67 for power - law distributions with column density @xmath130  ev/@xmath131 and several values for the lower cutoff energy ( @xmath132  ev ) .",
    "it is clear that the overall spectrum displays a steepening which has the right qualitative features to explain the knee although it does not provide an accurate fit to neither akeno nor casablanca data individually . turning now to discuss the dependence of the results on the lower cutoff energy",
    ", it is found that , apart from minor differences arising from spectrum normalization , lower values of @xmath133 yield lower fluxes in the high energy end .",
    "the explanation for this is that from the expression for the photodisintegration emission rate ( eq.(6 ) ) it turns out that the role of @xmath133 is that of determining a value of the particle energy @xmath67 , such that below @xmath67 the giant dipole resonance dominates , while above @xmath67 the flat high energy regime of @xmath134 prevails .",
    "as we lower @xmath133 , more photons with lower energy become available so that the flux suppression imposed by the giant resonance extends to higher particle energies .",
    "= 3.0 in    this analysis provides a suitable explanation of the results shown in figure 5 , as well as those of figure 2(b ) .",
    "the results previously obtained for power - law spectra @xcite show an extremely abrupt flux suppression that seems to be in contrast with experimental data ( cr energy spectra and , especially , cr mass composition ) above @xmath135  ev , and can be attributed to the negligible value for @xmath133 adopted there .",
    "the use of a non negligible cutoff prevents the flux suppression and provides a better fit to observations in this energy region .",
    "it should also be remarked that a solution yielding an excessive cr flux at energies above @xmath8 ev is by no means troublesome since it is clear that at these high energies efficient leakage of crs from the galaxy can not be disregarded , and that a less effective acceleration could also be playing a role .",
    "these mechanisms would clearly contribute to lower the cr flux , so that it does not seem reasonable to expect a reliable explanation of the cr spectrum by photodisintegration processes alone beyond @xmath136  ev .",
    "= 3.0 in    figure 6 shows plots of the proton and neutron components ( @xmath137 and @xmath138 , respectively ) as well as the total cr flux @xmath118 for the planckian photon spectrum with @xmath124  ev and @xmath139  ev/@xmath1 . in order to estimate the possible effects of the neutron mechanism",
    ", we also plotted the total cr flux that is obtained ignoring the escape of neutrons , labelled @xmath140 . from the figure",
    "it is seen that the neutron mechanism raises the cr total flux by @xmath141 for @xmath142  ev .",
    "had we adopted a column density @xmath143  ev/@xmath1 , the corresponding flux increment would be only @xmath144 .",
    "nevertheless , it should be noted that these results correspond to very high column densities ( actually inconsistent with the observed cr composition ) , and that effects arising from the neutron escape mechanism turn out to be negligible for lower values of the column density @xmath145 , for which also the photopion losses of protons can be altogether ignored .    to see what are the implications for the sources in order to produce the required photon densities for this scenario to work ,",
    "let us make the following simple estimate .",
    "an isotropic source with photon energy density @xmath146 at its surface ( with radius @xmath147 ) will have around it a photon energy density given by @xmath148 .",
    "this means that the photon column density measured radially from the surface is @xmath149 .",
    "on the other hand , if the crs are magnetically confined near the source , the path they travel across the dense photon field will be larger , i.e. @xmath150 , with the parameter @xmath151 . if to obtain an estimate of the maximum achievable densities we assume that the source radiates with a luminosity @xmath152 smaller than the eddington limit , i.e. @xmath153  erg / s , with @xmath154 the mass of the source , @xmath155 the proton mass and @xmath156 thomson s cross section , we find that the radius of the source needs to satisfy @xmath157 and hence the photon source",
    "must be compact ( like a pulsar ) and in general smaller than the typical size of a white dwarf .",
    "it has to be mentioned however that in non - steady - state situations like in supernova explosions , luminosities larger than @xmath158 are possible .",
    "another consideration is that if the source has a black - body spectrum with temperature @xmath23 and it is radiating at the eddington limit , the relation @xmath159 implies that @xmath160 ev@xmath161  km/@xmath162 , and hence for the photon energies to be in the optical / uv region , radii somewhat larger than those of neutron stars would be favored ( or the luminosity should be smaller than @xmath158 ) .    as a summary ,",
    "we have considered in more detail the photodisintegration of cr nuclei in the scenario in which their interaction with optical and soft uv photons around the source is responsible for the steepening of the spectrum and for the change in composition above the knee .",
    "the more accurate treatment of the nuclear processes , in particular the inclusion of the multinucleon emission , implies that the required photon column densities are lower ( by an order of magnitude ) than previously obtained . the main difference between this scenario and other ( rigidity dependent ) explanations proposed for the knee is the resulting cr composition , which here becomes lighter above @xmath2  ev .",
