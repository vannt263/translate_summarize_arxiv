    "soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) sporadically emit brief ( @xmath4s ) intense bursts of soft gamma - rays .",
    "three of the five known sgrs have produced rare `` giant flare '' events with initial bright , short ( @xmath5s ) pulses with peak electromagnetic ( em ) luminosities between @xmath6 and @xmath7erg  s@xmath8 , placing them among the most em luminous events in the universe . according to the `` magnetar '' model sgrs are galactic neutron stars with extreme magnetic fields @xmath9g@xcite .",
    "bursts may result from the interaction of the star s magnetic field with its solid crust , leading to crustal deformations and occasional catastrophic cracking@xcite with subsequent excitation of nonradial neutron star @xmath10-modes@xcite and the emission of gws@xcite . for reviews ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "occasionally sgrs produce many soft - gamma bursts in a brief period of time ; such intense emissions are referred to as `` storms . ''",
    "we present a search for short - duration gw signals ( @xmath110.3s ) associated with _ multiple _",
    "bursts in the 2006 march 29 sgr 1900 + 14 storm@xcite using data collected by the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo ) @xcite .",
    "the storm light curve , obtained from the burst alert telescope ( bat ) aboard the swift satellite@xcite , is shown in fig.[fig : lc_rises ] .",
    "it consists of more than 40 bursts in @xmath1230s , including common sgr bursts and some intermediate flares with durations @xmath13s .",
    "the total fluence for the storm event was estimated by the konus - wind team to be @xmath14erg@xmath15 in the ( 20200)kev range@xcite , implying an isotropic em energy @xmath16erg at a nominal distance to sgr 1900 + 14 of 10kpc ( source location and distance is discussed in@xcite ) . at the time of the storm both of the 4 km ligo detectors ( located at hanford , wa and livingston , la )",
    "were taking science quality data .",
    "we attempt to improve sensitivity to multiple weak gw burst signals associated with the storm s multiple em bursts by adding together gw signal power over multiple bursts . in doing",
    "so we assume particular gw emission models , which we describe in the next section .",
    "[ fig : lc_stack ] illustrates the stacking procedure using the four most energetic bursts in the storm .",
    "the analysis is performed by the stack - a - flare pipeline@xcite , which extends the method used in a recent ligo search for transient gw associated with individual sgr bursts@xcite and relies on an excess power detection statistic  @xcite . to `` stack '' @xmath17 bursts in the storm , we first generate @xmath17 excess power time - frequency tilings .",
    "these are 2-dimensional matrices in time and frequency generated from the two detectors data streams .",
    "each tiling element gives an excess power estimate in the gw detector data stream in a small period of time @xmath18 and a small range of frequency @xmath19 .",
    "the time range of each tiling is chosen to be centered on the time of one of the target em bursts in the storm .",
    "we then align these @xmath17 tilings along the time dimension so that times of the target em bursts coincide , and perform a weighted addition .",
    "stacking significantly improves sensitivity to gw emission under a given model .",
    "however , improving detection probability depends upon stacking according to gw emission models that correctly describe nature .",
    "the storm light curve motivated two stacking models : a flat - weighted model which includes the 11 most energetic em bursts with unity weighting factors ; and an em - fluence - weighted model comprised of the 18 most energetic em bursts .",
    "the @xmath20 cutoff in the flat model is motivated by a clear separation in em fluence of the 11 most energetic bursts in the storm .",
    "including the 18 most energetic bursts in the fluence - weighted model accounts for 95% of the total em fluence of the more than 40 bursts in the light curve . in the fluence - weighted model , time - frequency excess power tilings",
    "are weighted according to burst - integrated bat counts before stacking .",
    "further details are in@xcite .",
    "to obtain estimates of the times of em bursts in the storm , we measure the intersections of the rapid rising edges of each burst with the light curve noise floor measured in a quiescent period of data in the 50s bat sequence before the start of the storm ( fig . [",
    "fig : lc_rises ] ) .",
    "we correct these times for satellite - to - geocenter times - of - flight using the known sgr 1900 + 14 sky position and swift ephemeris , which vary from ( 17.1217.48)ms over the @xmath1230s duration of the storm .",
    "the stack - a - flare analysis method is robust to relative timing errors smaller than gw signal durations@xcite .",
    "em fluences are estimated by integrating detector counts under each burst in the light curve .",
    "we conservatively converted counts to fluences using the lower bound of the konus - wind total fluence range given above .",
    "we divide the gw data into an on - source time region , in which gws associated with the storm could be expected , and a background region , with statistically similar noise in which we do not expect a gw .",
    "this is done after applying category 1 and category 2 data quality cuts described in@xcite .",
    "the on - source region consists of 4s of stacked data .",
    "each 4s region comprising the stack is centered on the time of one of the em bursts included in the gw emission stacking model .",
    "background regions consist of 1000s of data on either side of the storm . on - source and background segments",
    "are analyzed and stacked identically , and the stacked time - frequency tilings are passed through a clustering algorithm resulting in lists of `` analysis events . '' background analysis events due to fluctuating detector noise are used to estimate the significance of on - source events ; significant events , if any , are subject to vetoes@xcite .",
    "using @xmath212s regions around bursts in the storm accounts for uncertainties in the em burst times and a possible systematic delay between gw and em emission .",
    "although gw emission in sgrs is expected to occur almost simultaneously with the em burst@xcite , a common bias in trigger times shared by all bursts in the stacking set of @xmath111s can be handled with a @xmath212s on - source region .",
    "as in@xcite , this search targets neutron star fundamental mode ringdowns ( rds ) predicted in@xcite as well as short - duration gw signals of unknown waveform .",
    "rds are targeted because @xmath10-modes are the most efficient gw emitters@xcite .",
    "we assume that given a neutron star , @xmath10-mode frequencies and damping timescales would be similar from event to event , and that unknown signals would at least have similar central frequencies and durations from event to event .    as in @xcite",
    ", we thus focus on two distinct regions in the target signal time - frequency parameter space . the first region targets @xmath12100 - 400ms duration signals in the ( 13)khz band , which includes @xmath10-mode rd signals predicted in@xcite for ten realistic neutron star equations of state .",
    "we choose a search band of ( 13)khz for rd searches , with a 250ms time window which was found to give optimal search sensitivity@xcite .",
    "the second region targets @xmath12(5200)ms duration signals in the ( 1001000)hz band .",
    "the target durations are set by prompt sgr burst timescales ( 5ms to 200ms ) and the target frequencies are set by the detector s sensitive region .",
    "we search in two bands : ( 100200)hz ( probing the region in which the detectors are most sensitive ) and ( 1001000)hz ( for full spectral coverage below the rd search band ) using a 125ms time window . in all , we search in three frequency bands and two gw emission models ( flat and fluence - weighted ) .",
    "this amounts to a total of six 4s - long stacked on - source regions .",
    "we estimate loudest - event upper limits@xcite on gw root - sum - squared strain @xmath22 incident at the detector . we can construct simulations of impinging gw with a given @xmath22 . following @xcite h_^2 = h_^2 + h_^2 , where e.g. h_^2 =",
    "_ -^ | h_+ |^2 dt and @xmath23 are the two gw polarizations .",
    "the relationship between the gw polarizations and the detector response @xmath24 to an impinging gw from a polar angle and azimuth @xmath25 and with polarization angle @xmath26 is : h(t ) = f_+ ( , , ) h_+(t ) + f _ ( , , ) h_(t ) [ eq : hsim ] where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the antenna functions for the source at @xmath25@xcite . at the time of the storm ,",
    "the polarization - independent rms antenna response @xmath29 , which indicates the average sensitivity to a given sky location , was 0.39 for ligo hanford observatory and 0.46 for the ligo livingston observatory .",
    "we can also set upper limits on the emitted isotropic gw emission energy @xmath0 at a source distance @xmath30 associated with @xmath31 and @xmath32 via@xcite e _",
    "= 4r^2 _ -^((_+)^2 + ( _ )",
    "^2 ) dt .    the procedure for estimating loudest - event upper limits in the individual burst search is detailed in@xcite . in brief , the upper limit is computed in a frequentist framework by injecting artificial signals into the background data and recovering them with the search pipeline(see for example @xcite ) . an analysis event is associated with each injection , and compared to the loudest on - source analysis event . the gw strain or isotropic energy at 90% detection efficiency is the strain or isotropic energy at which 90% of injections have associated events louder than the loudest on - source event .",
    "we use the twelve waveform types described in@xcite to establish detector sensitivity and thereby set upper limits : linearly and circularly polarized rds with @xmath33ms and frequencies in the range ( 13)khz ; and band- and time - limited white noise bursts ( wnbs ) with durations of 11ms and 100ms and frequency bands matched to the two lower frequency search bands .",
    "these waveforms are used to construct compound injections determined by the emission model . in the flat model ,",
    "11 gw bursts comprise a compound injection , each is identical , and our stated @xmath22 and @xmath0 are for one such gw burst in the compound injection . in the fluence - weighted model ,",
    "18 gw bursts comprise a compound injection , they are weighted ( in amplitude ) with the square root of integrated counts , and our stated @xmath22 and @xmath0 are for the loudest gw burst in the compound injection .",
    "a single polarization angle is chosen randomly for every compound injection . in assuming that the bursts emitted are identical up to an amplitude scale factor",
    ", we implicitly assume the star s gw emission mechanism and symmetry axis are constant over bursts in the storm .",
    "[ cols=\"<,>,<,>,^,^,>,<,>,^,^ \" , ]     we find no statistically significant gw signal associated with the sgr 1900 + 14 storm .",
    "the significance of on - source analysis events is inferred by noting the rate at which background analysis events of equal or greater loudness occur .",
    "we examined 4s stacked on - source regions in the flat and fluence - weighted models in the three search bands .",
    "the most significant on - source analysis event from these six searches was from the flat model in the ( 1001000)hz band and had a corresponding background rate of @xmath34hz ( 1 per 20s ) in that search .",

    "[ fig : bestresultsegw ] give model - dependent loudest - event upper limits at 90% detection efficiency computed for the gw signal associated with the single loudest em burst .",
    "we give strain upper limits ( @xmath35 ) and isotropic emission energy upper limits at a nominal sgr 1900 + 14 distance of 10kpc ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "we also give upper limits @xmath37 , a source - distance - independent measure of the extent to which an energy upper limit probes the gw emission efficiency , calculated using a conservative estimate of @xmath38erg @xmath15 for the total fluence of the storm to estimate fluences for individual peaks . in the fluence - weighted model , @xmath39 is the same for each individual burst . in the flat model",
    "we report the mean value of @xmath39 for the 11 bursts .",
    "superscripts in table[table : bestresults ] give a systematic error and uncertainties at 90% confidence .",
    "( similar estimates were made for the @xmath36 but are not shown in the table . )",
    "the first and second superscripts account for the systematic error and statistical uncertainty , respectively , in the detector calibrations .",
    "the third is the statistical uncertainty from using a finite number of trials ( 200 ) in the monte carlos , estimated with the bootstrap method using 200 ensembles@xcite .",
    "the systematic error and the quadrature sum of the statistical uncertainties are added to the final sensitivity estimates .",
    "one - sigma burst timing uncertainties from fits of burst rising edges are accounted for in the monte carlo simulations .",
    "estimating uncertainties is further described in@xcite .",
    "the stacked search described here extends the recent ligo search for gw associated with the 2004 sgr 180620 giant flare and 190 lesser events from sgr 180620 and sgr 1900 + 14@xcite .",
    "that search was the first search sensitive to neutron star @xmath40-modes , and it set individual burst upper limits @xmath36 ranging from @xmath41erg to @xmath42erg ( depending on waveform type and detector antenna factors and noise characteristics at the time of the burst ) , but did not detect any gws .",
    "the best values of @xmath43 in @xcite , for the giant flare , were in the range @xmath44@xmath45 depending on waveform type .",
    "the upper limits obtained here are a factor of 12 more sensitive in energy than the sgr 1900 + 14 storm upper limits in @xcite , which analyzed the storm in a single @xmath46s on - source region .",
    "those previous limits already overlapped the range of em energies seen in the loudest flares as well as the range of gw energies predicted by the most extreme models  @xcite .",
    "the flat model gives isotropic energy upper limits on average a factor of 4 lower than a reference @xmath47 ( non - stacked ) scenario ( with a @xmath48s on - source region ) and a factor of 2 lower than the fluence - weighted model .",
    "however , our storm @xmath49 upper limits are still a few hundred times the sgr 180620 giant flare @xmath39 upper limits , due to the tremendous em energy released by the giant flare .",
    "there is very little discussion of @xmath39 in the theory literature with which to compare .",
    "the advanced ligo detectors promise an improvement in energy sensitivity of more than a factor of 100 .",
    "furthermore , on 2008 august 22 , sgr 0501 + 4516 was discovered@xcite and may be located only 1.5kpc away @xcite .",
    "sgr 0501 + 4516 searches will thus gain an additional 2 orders of magnitude in energy and @xmath39 upper limits compared to sgrs at 10kpc . a stacking analysis of sgr 0501 + 4516 bursts with advanced ligo ( a gain of 4 orders of magnitude in energy sensitivity ) could therefore reach @xmath39 values below unity , even without another giant flare .",
    "in the future we plan to carry out stacking searches on isolated sgr bursts , and eventually to perform searches using advanced ligo data .",
    "our stacked upper limits depend on theoretical guidance as to what weightings and time delays are possible , and the significance of our results depends on predictions of the range of @xmath0 and @xmath39 ; yet all of these things are scarce . we hope that our continued efforts to search for gw associated with sgr and anomalous x - ray pulsar bursts encourage further modeling of gw emission from these intriguing objects",
