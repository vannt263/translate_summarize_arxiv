    "nonabelian far - from - equilibrium plasmas occur in many cosmological pre / reheating scenarios @xcite or due to possible cosmological phase transitions @xcite , as well as in the early stages of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "these far - from - equilibrium systems may be overoccupied , such that the energy is spread out in longer wave - length modes than in thermal equilibrium but with stronger fields .",
    "this is the case , _",
    "e.g. _ , for fields generated through parametric resonance , and in heavy - ion collisions , at least in the limit of asymptotically large centre of mass energies , where the initial condition may be described using the color - glass - condensate framework @xcite .",
    "alternately , far - from equilibrium systems may be underoccupied , such that the system consists of fewer , but more energetic , quasiparticles than the corresponding thermal system .",
    "this is the case in , _",
    "e.g. _ , planck suppressed decay of inflatons @xcite .",
    "also , even though the initial condition of heavy - ion collisions is overoccupied , it has been demonstrated by baier , mueller , schiff and son @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that the longitudinal expansion renders the prethermal fireball underoccupied before it reaches local thermal equilibrium .",
    "this has motivated several numerical @xcite and analytical @xcite works to study simple far - from - equilibrium model systems , in particular that of a single species of gauge bosons in a flat space - time with statistically isotropic initial conditions at weak coupling , which we investigate in this letter with both over- and underoccupied initial conditions . in both cases , we follow the time evolution of the system from the initial far - from - equilibrium state to thermal equilibrium and extract the thermalization time , which we define as the exponent governing relaxation of the deviation of the first moment of the distribution function from its equilibrium value @xmath5 at late times @xmath6    in the overoccupied case , early dynamics fall onto a non - thermal attractor solution : if the initial momentum scale characterised by @xmath7 is much smaller than the momentum scale of the target thermal system , then the scattering time of the initial system @xmath8 @xcite is faster than that of the thermalized system @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the final equilibrium temperature and @xmath11 the thooft coupling .",
    "while it takes the system at least @xmath12 to reach thermal equilibrium , it only takes @xmath13 to lose detailed information of its initial condition .",
    "therefore , at times @xmath14 the system will reside in a state that is almost independent of the initial condition but time - varying ; this is the non - thermal fixed point .",
    "the fixed point is described by a scaling form of the occupation function @xmath15 , where the scaling function @xmath16 is proportional to @xmath17 at small momenta and decays exponentially above an evolving scale @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "there have been several numerical studies demonstrating the approach to and details of the fixed point using classical yang - mills theory @xcite and the effective kinetic theory ( ekt ) of arnold , moore and yaffe @xcite .",
    "the simulations have so far been limited to the classical limit ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) , and therefore the transition from the non - thermal fixed point to thermal equilibrium ( with @xmath21 ) has not been addressed and current estimates of the thermalization time are purely parametric . in this letter",
    "we demonstrate using numerical simulations of ekt that the fixed point solution  and any initial condition that falls to the basin of attraction of the fixed point  reaches thermal equilibrium in time proportional to @xmath22    in the underoccupied case , the scattering time of the initial state is much longer than that of the target thermal system , and therefore the system only loses information about the initial conditions on final thermalization .",
    "but we demonstrate that some features of the intermediate state do exhibit partial insensitivity to the details of the initial condition .",
    "the equilibration of the underoccupied system proceeds via  bottom - up ",
    "thermalization @xcite ( see in the case on expanding background @xcite ) : the initial hard particles radiate soft radiation , which forms a thermal background through which the hard particles propagate .",
    "interaction with the thermal background eventually causes the hard particles to undergo a radiational breakup releasing their energy to the thermal bath .",
    "parametrically , the breakup takes place in the same timescale that it takes for a jet of momentum @xmath2 to be quenched in a thermal bath of temperature @xmath10 , @xmath23 .",
    "the dominant interaction is between the hard particles and the thermal bath , not among the hard particles themselves @xcite , and therefore the equilibration depends only on a few averaged features of the initial condition .",
    "we find that the creation of the soft thermal bath is mainly sensitive to the number of particles in the initial condition @xmath24 , whereas the final thermalization time @xmath25 shows sensitivity to the initial momentum scale @xmath2 .",
    "in the weak coupling limit @xmath26 , the evolution of modes with perturbative occupancies @xmath27 and whose momenta are larger the screening scale @xmath28 can be described to leading order in @xmath29 by an effective kinetic equation for the color averaged gauge boson distribution function @xcite _",

    "the daughters undergo successive resplittings until they have deposited their energy into the thermal bath ( dashed lines in figure [ creation of soft particles ] ) .",
    "parametrically , the rate for the first hard splitting and therefore for the cascade is @xmath79 up to logarithmic corrections @xcite . as in the case of the overoccupied system , we observe that the dependence of the various moments of distribution function on @xmath40 can be accounted for by a multiplicative rescaling of the time variable , including a logarithm @xmath80 with @xmath81 .",
    "we furthermore find that most of the dependence on the initial condition can be accounted for by rescaling the time by @xmath82 as expected from the parametric estimate for the thermalization time .",
