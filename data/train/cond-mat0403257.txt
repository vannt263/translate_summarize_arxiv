    "there is , currently , a substantial activity in the research into the physics of josephson qubits . in particular many groups  @xcite became interested in studying the systems composed of josephson qubits and harmonic oscillators , e.g. , microwave cavities , mechanical resonators etc .",
    "thus the field starts to resemble quantum optics where atoms in cavities have been investigated for many years . on one hand",
    "there are many results which can be simply `` translated '' from the `` language '' of quantum optics to the `` language '' of solid state physics . on the other hand",
    "there are specific properties of the solid state devices that might require further research .",
    "in this paper we study the dynamics of a two - level system ( qubit ) and a cavity at resonance . in quantum optics",
    "this regime is the most studied and interesting one .",
    "the corresponding jaynes - cummings model ( for a review see ref .  )",
    "has been widely investigated in the literature .",
    "experimentally , however , the strong coupling regime is difficult to achieve and it is also a challenge to keep the atom in the cavity for a long time . in optical cavities",
    "the strong coupling regime was achieved only a decade ago  @xcite .",
    "rydberg atoms in superconducting cavities  @xcite provide the strong coupling regime and one can even perform quantum gates during the time of flight of the atom through the cavity .    in solid state devices , e.g. , a josephson qubit resonantly coupled to a damped strip - line superconducting cavity  @xcite , the `` atom '' is permanently placed in the cavity .",
    "this should simplify the time constraints .",
    "also , the strong coupling limit seems to be possible .",
    "thus these circuits constitute very promising setups for exploring the strong coupling limit of cavity qed .",
    "compared to optical cavities , one of the differences is the finite temperature of solid state devices . moreover , even if the nominal temperature of the refrigerator is much lower than the cavity s energy splitting , the hot photons can arrive via the leads connecting to the controlling circuits .",
    "thus the elevated temperature regime is of substantial interest .",
    "we are aware of only one article addressing the finite temperature case , namely  ref .  .",
    "in this paper we expand the domain of parameters as compared with ref .  .",
    "namely we consider the case when both the qubit s and the cavity s dissipative rates are much smaller than the cavity - qubit coupling ( rabi - frequency ) and both the cavity and the qubit are coupled to the finite temperature baths .",
    "moreover we focus on the correlation functions of the cavity , e.g. , cavity susceptibility . in solid state systems",
    "this quantity is particularly convenient to measure as it is related to the impedance of the strip - line cavity .",
    "the temperature - dependence of this impedance constitutes a direct tool for probing the number of photons in the cavity .    at low temperatures the dynamics",
    "is very simple .",
    "only a few states are occupied and the susceptibility may be presented as a sum of lorentzians , corresponding to a few transitions allowed from these states .",
    "e.g. , at zero temperature only two transitions are relevant and the resonant peak of the uncoupled cavity is rabi split by the qubit to two peaks . at high temperatures",
    "the frequencies of different allowed transitions are densely packed near the oscillator s frequency .",
    "this situation is called liouvillian degeneracy as , formally , different modes of the liouville evolution operator are almost degenerate  @xcite .",
    "we show that the secular approximation , widely used within the bloch - redfield formalism , fails due to the liouvillian degeneracy .",
    "the insufficiency of the secular approximation was already noticed in , e.g. , ref .  .",
    "in this situation one has to take more elements of the redfield tensor into account than required by the secular approximation .",
    "on the other hand the optical master equation takes all the necessary elements into account and thus produces correct results .",
    "we follow the recent proposal , presented in ref .  ,",
    "in which a superconducting charge qubit , coupled capacitatively to a cavity formed in a coplanar waveguide , is shown to be a favorable system for reaching the strong coupling regime of cavity qed .",
    "typical parameters are cavity resonance / atom transition frequency of @xmath0 ghz , a vacuum rabi - frequency of @xmath1 mhz , a cavity lifetime of @xmath2 ns ( quality factor @xmath3 ) , and an atom lifetime @xmath4s . the system is measured by detecting absorption and phase shift of microwaves sent through the waveguide . in this paper",
    "we calculate the linear response absorption of the system .",
    "motivated by the experimental parameters we focus on the regime of strong coupling @xmath5 , and also assume that cavity dissipation dominates over atom dissipation @xmath6 .",
    "we note that the photon temperature in the cavity may be much higher than the base temperature of the cryostat , due to coupling to room temperature sources through the waveguide . by measuring the absorption spectra",
    "one may determine the photon temperature of the cavity .",
    "assuming the qubit to be at the degeneracy point @xcite , and for the moment neglecting dissipation , we arrive at the jaynes - cummings model , described by the following hamiltonian @xmath7 where @xmath8 operates on atom / qubit while @xmath9 are ladder operators of the cavity / oscillator .",
    "we consider the resonant regime when @xmath10 .",
    "the system s spectrum for @xmath11 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "it is obtained by , first , analyzing the spectrum for @xmath12 ( left side ) and , then , lifting the degeneracies by the coupling @xmath13 ( right side ) .",
    "assuming @xmath14 we can take into account the coupling term only when it lifts the degeneracies in the spectrum .",
    "the ground state of the uncoupled system is @xmath15 , which is non - degenerate .",
    "all other states are doubly degenerate , i.e. the states @xmath16 and @xmath17 form degenerate doublets for each @xmath18 .",
    "every such doublet is split by the interaction .",
    "we can thus define the `` bonding '' and the `` anti - bonding '' states @xmath19 .",
    "the energies of these states are @xmath20 .",
    "in ordinary cavity qed the atom susceptibility is usually probed . for the qubit - oscillator system",
    "the susceptibility of the oscillator ( cavity ) is the most easily measured quantity .",
    "it is defined as @xmath21_{-}\\rangle \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath22 .",
    "the fourier transform is @xmath23 .",
    "the imaginary part of the susceptibility is proportional to the dissipative real part of the impedance , i.e. , @xmath24 . for a closed system with quantum levels @xmath25 , with stationary occupation probabilities",
    "@xmath26 , it can be presented as @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "thus it is a series of delta - peaks , corresponding to the allowed transitions .    at @xmath29",
    "only the ground state is occupied and the two allowed transitions have frequencies @xmath30 and @xmath31 and the matrix elements @xmath32 .",
    "thus the uncoupled oscillator s peak at @xmath33 is split as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rabisplit ] .",
    "this is called rabi - splitting .    at @xmath34",
    "higher energy states are occupied .",
    "the transitions are allowed only between neighboring doublets .",
    "there are two classes of allowed transitions .",
    "the `` bonding - bonding '' or `` anti - bonding - anti - bonding '' transitions correspond to the transition frequencies @xmath35 with the matrix elements @xmath36 they form the first class of transitions which all are positioned inside of the zero temperature rabi - splitting .",
    "analogously , the `` bonding - anti - bonding '' transitions with frequencies @xmath37 and matrix elements @xmath38 are all positioned outside the rabi - splitting . both classes of transitions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : finitetimp ] .",
    "due to the dissipation the delta functions should be widened to lorentzians . at zero temperature",
    "the widths of the peaks are estimated as @xmath39 ( the factor @xmath40 is due to the reduced matrix element for each transition as compared to the original oscillator s transition ) .",
    "the problem is getting the line - shape at finite ( relatively high ) temperatures and high values of @xmath41 .",
    "indeed , when temperature becomes of order @xmath42 more transitions become available . to estimate the heights of the peaks we note that the occupation probabilities of the doublets are estimated as @xmath43 .",
    "the matrix elements for the `` bonding - bonding '' or `` anti - bonding - anti - bonding '' transitions grow as @xmath44 , while those for `` bonding - anti - bonding '' transitions decay as @xmath45 .",
    "thus we obtain a `` poisson '' distribution for the `` bonding - bonding '' or `` anti - bonding - anti - bonding '' peaks heights with the maximum at @xmath46 .",
    "the heights of the `` bonding - anti - bonding '' peaks decay with @xmath47 .",
    "therefore the highest peaks are situated at @xmath48 .",
    "the spacing between the dominant peaks ( @xmath49 ) thus decrease with temperature , while their width ( @xmath50 ) increase with temperature . around the cross - over temperature @xmath51 the peaks start to overlap .    thus , as the temperature grows , we have a transition from a quite `` un - harmonic '' spectrum without liouvillian symmetry , where all transition frequencies are different , to a spectrum which resembles that of two uncoupled linear oscillators , see fig .",
    "[ fig : hightempspec ] .",
    "the widths of the peaks in these two cases behave qualitatively different . in the first ( un - harmonic ) case",
    "the widths grow with temperature , while in the second ( harmonic oscillator ) case they do not .",
    "the qubit / atom is also subjected to dissipation , which will add to the peak widths in the susceptibility . at the degeneracy point of the qubit the longitudinal noise ( coupled to @xmath52 )",
    "is suppressed to first order  @xcite .",
    "the transverse noise ( coupled to @xmath53 ) will induce transitions in the qubit , characterized by the rate @xmath54 . in terms of the jaynes - cummings",
    "eigenstates the qubit dissipation cause similar transitions as the cavity dissipation .",
    "a major difference is that the matrix elements for these transitions are independent of the oscillator state @xmath47 .",
    "thus , as long as the two sources of dissipation are of the same order of magnitude , the high temperature susceptibility will be determined by the cavity dissipation .",
    "we model the cavity / atom dissipation by coupling an observable @xmath55 of a thermal bath to the @xmath56-coordinate of the cavity / atom : @xmath57 one popular choice of a bath is the harmonic oscillator one  @xcite . in this case @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "however , as we are assuming weak dissipation and doing the lowest order calculation , the precise nature of the bath is unimportant and only the bath correlator @xmath60 matters .",
    "the bloch - redfield equation  @xcite is a kinetic equation for the reduced ( qubit+cavity ) density matrix : @xmath61 where the bloch - redfield tensor is given by @xmath62 and @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the laplace transform of the cavity bath correlator @xmath65 introducing the fourier image of the unsymmetrized correlator @xmath66 , we obtain @xmath67 thus for the real part of @xmath68 which determines the transition rates we obtain @xmath69 .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath68 is responsible for the energy shifts ( lamb shift ) .",
    "@xmath70 of the qubit bath is defined and treated analogously .    considering a high quality cavity ( @xmath71 ) , and low qubit dissipation ( @xmath72 ) , we limit ourselves to single photon exchange with the baths .",
    "the possible transition energies in eq .",
    "( [ lambda_def ] ) are @xmath73 , ( see eqs .",
    "( [ bb_freq])-([ba_mat_elements ] ) ) .",
    "furthermore we assume that the baths have no structure on the scale of the qubit - oscillator coupling @xmath13 , leaving only one relevant parameter for relaxation @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and one for excitation @xmath76 , @xmath77 , for each bath .",
    "looking for the slow dynamics of our system , on the time - scale given by the dissipation ( @xmath78 ) , we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ breq ] ) in the rotating frame @xmath79 where @xmath80 evolves slowly in time .    when there are no liouvillian degeneracies the phase @xmath81 in the above expression rotates with a frequency of the order of @xmath82 , except when @xmath83 and @xmath84 , or @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "secular _ approximation is a random - phase type of approximation , keeping _ only _ the corresponding elements of redfield tensor , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .    within the secular approximation the bloch - redfield equation separates into a master equation governing the occupation numbers : @xmath87 , and a simple exponential decay of all off - diagonal elements of the density matrix : @xmath88 .",
    "in the susceptibility we find that the weights of the peaks are given by the steady - state occupation numbers , determined by the transition rates ( @xmath89 ) , while the peak widths are given by the dephasing rates ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "when difference between two transition frequencies @xmath90 ( @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) becomes smaller than the transitions widths @xmath93 the peaks start to overlap . in this case",
    "there is no justification for the secular approximation , and more elements of the redfield tensor must be retained .    in the lowest order ( single - photon transitions )",
    "the allowed transition ( photon ) frequencies are @xmath94 , giving two possible values for @xmath95 .",
    "looking for slow dynamics we neglect the elements @xmath96 corresponding to the liouvillian modes with @xmath97 .",
    "this is equivalent to a rotating - wave - approximation in the coupling to the bath .",
    "we keep , however , the elements @xmath96 corresponding to the liouvillian modes with @xmath98 .",
    "that is , grouping the elements of the density matrix @xmath99 according to the energy difference @xmath100 , we now couple only the elements with similar @xmath101 , but leave the elements with different @xmath101 uncoupled .",
    "we also note that the bloch - redfield equation with this choise of the elements @xmath96 is equivalent to the `` quantum optics '' master equation : @xmath102 +   \\kappa n_\\kappa ( 2a^\\dag\\rho a - a a^\\dag\\rho-\\rho a a^\\dag)\\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\kappa ( n_\\kappa+1)(2a\\rho a^\\dag - a^\\dag a\\rho-\\rho a^\\dag a)\\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\gamma n_\\gamma ( 2\\sigma^+\\rho \\sigma^-   -\\sigma^-\\sigma^+",

    "in our numerical studies we take into account the lowest @xmath104 states of the harmonic oscillator , and then check for convergence by increasing @xmath104 .",
    "we work in the eigenbasis of the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian ( eq .  [ jcham ] ) , which we obtain by numerical diagonalization .",
    "we then rewrite the bloch - redfield equation ( eq .",

    "the solution can then be written @xmath111 which we evaluate by exact diagonalization of @xmath112 , which is the bottleneck of the calculation since the size of this matrix grows with @xmath113 .",
    "fortunately the property of the redfield tensor to couple only elements of the density matrix @xmath99 with similar energy difference @xmath114 , makes the matrix @xmath115 block - diagonal .",
    "the size of each block is only @xmath116 , which makes the problem tractable up to hundreds of states in the cavity .",
    "the cavity susceptibility is defined as @xmath117 where the system is in its steady - state at @xmath118 . in our case",
    "the steady state density matrix is diagonal with occupation numbers , determined by the temperatures of the baths , on the diagonal ( @xmath119 ) .    using the quantum fluctuation regression theorem we find @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the solution to the bloch - redfield equation with initial condition @xmath122 .    using the solution in eq .",
    "( [ brsol ] ) we can perform the laplace transform in eq .",
    "( [ cavsusdef ] ) analytically .",
    "we now note that the main contribution to the susceptibility around @xmath123 , which is the main topic of this paper , comes from the block of @xmath115 connecting elements @xmath99 with energy difference @xmath124 .",
