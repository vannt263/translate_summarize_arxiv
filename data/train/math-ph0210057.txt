    "having produced an euler angle parameterization for @xmath0 we now turn our attention to explicitly writing down the euler parameterization for the unitary group , @xmath1 ( which was hinted at in the @xmath0 work of @xcite ) .",
    "recall that @xmath1 is a subgroup of @xmath4 , the group of all complex @xmath5 matrices with non - vanishing determinant and requiring @xmath6 parameters to represent . in this manner",
    "we can define @xmath0 to be a subgroup of @xmath1 , requiring @xmath7 parameters to represent , by adding the extra condition that any element of @xmath0 has unit determinant .",
    "we can therefore expect that not only will the euler parameterization of @xmath1 be easy to produce but also the group volume , once we exploit some simple group relationships between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the importance of such a parameterization and its corresponding volume equation , beyond that discussed in @xcite , is that it gives us the ability to calculate the measures and volumes for general @xmath3-dimensional pure and mixed state density matrices , as well as the volumes of the manifolds of operations on pure and mixed states which produce entangled and separable states ( which are directly related to the volume of separable and entangled states ) without having to resort to extensive numerical computations as in @xcite .",
    "the idea behind the parameterization of @xmath1 is straightforward . referring to our previous work @xcite , for notations and details , as well as to nakahara @xcite , sattinger @xcite , and others we know the following relationship holds between @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 : @xmath8 the @xmath9 in the denominator of the second equality is the @xmath9 element from the @xmath10 group in the numerator , which we know from @xcite to be : @xmath11 using the @xmath0 parameterization work done previously @xcite , we can write down the euler parameterization of @xmath1 quite easily . recall from @xcite we know we can write down a semi - direct sum for the lie algebra for @xmath0 as @xmath12 which yields a decomposition of the group , @xmath13 where @xmath14 . from this work , we also know that @xmath15 is comprised of the generators of the @xmath16 subalgebra of @xmath0 , and therefore @xmath17 will be the @xmath18 subgroup obtained by exponentiating this subalgebra , @xmath19 , combined with @xmath20 and thus can be written as ( see @xcite for examples ) @xmath21\\cdot e^{i\\lambda_{n^2 - 1 } \\phi}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 $ ] represents the @xmath23 term euler angle parameterization of the @xmath16 subgroup .    we are now ready to look at the @xmath1 group in general . for a @xmath24 we have from equations and as well as from @xcite @xmath25\\cdot e^{i\\lambda_{(n+1)^2 - 1 } \\beta},\\ ] ] where @xmath26=&\\;\\biggl(\\prod_{2 \\leq k \\leq n}a(k",

    "from @xcite the volume of @xmath0 is known to be @xmath27 if we use equation then from @xcite we can define the following volume for @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 from equation we can write @xmath30 and thus using equations and we have @xmath31 for @xmath32 .",
    "note that when @xmath33 we generate the volume for the @xmath34 group element . since there can be many different @xmath9 s with different volumes , the fact that @xmath1 , when @xmath33 gives the @xmath35 group element volume demands that we limit the use of equation ( [ eq : unvol ] ) to @xmath36 .    with this information in hand",
    ", we can now look at the differential volume elements , and corresponding volumes of the full range of @xmath0 and @xmath1 cosets that are of interest in physics , beginning with the fundamental manifolds which define pure and mixed states .",
    "now that we have an euler angle parameterization for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 , for @xmath36 , we are now in a position to look at the group representations of pure and mixed states in terms of our parameterizations .    in general ,",
    "the manifold of pure states is given by the sequence of maps : @xmath37 these are related to the `` grassmannian '' manifolds , which are defined as @xmath38 on the other hand , the manifold for mixed states ( here for rank @xmath3 density matrices with non - degenerate and non - singular eigenvalues ) is given by @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 can be seen as the @xmath41-dimensional solid angle ( with appropriate ranges ) derived from the eigenvalues of a suitably parameterized @xmath41-dimensional sphere ( see @xcite ) , and the factor @xmath42 is the maximal torus spanned by the exponentiation of the cartan subalgebra of the group @xmath43 one may also notice that @xmath44 is stratified by noting that @xmath45 where the @xmath46 , denotes the ( possibly ) non - trivial topological product of the spaces .",
    "these cosets are called flag manifolds and the given topological product follows from the fact that the @xmath0 groups are products of odd - dimensional spheres ( see @xcite and references within ) .",
    "now , in order to do any `` physically '' meaningful calculation on either manifold we require their measures ; measures that can be derived by using the euler angle parameterizations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "it is to this question that we now turn our attention to .",
    "we know that pure states are in @xmath2 and from the previous sections that @xmath47 using the differential volume element for @xmath0 from @xcite we can immediately write down the pure state measure as @xmath48 where from @xcite @xmath49 with the following ranges @xmath50 note that these ranges are from the _ covering _ ranges for @xmath10 and not from @xmath51 which are used to calculate the invariant volume for @xmath10 ( see the appendices in @xcite for more details ) . on the other hand , one _ could _ use the @xmath52 ranges @xmath53 but then one would need to add a normalization factor of @xmath54 in front of the product in equation ( [ eq : dvpurestates ] ) in order to generate the correct volume for @xmath2 .",
    "it is interesting to note that equation ( [ eq : dvpurestates ] ) for @xmath55 is _ equivalent _ to the `` natural '' measure ( referred to in @xcite ) derived from the hurwitz parameterization ( see @xcite and references within ) . to begin , we define a general vector of a random 4-dimensional unitary matrix @xmath56 as @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) , and @xmath61 . from this vector",
    "one can calculate the corresponding fubini - study metric ( here given as in @xcite ) @xmath62 where in this case @xmath63 the square root of the determinant of which yields the invariant measure for @xmath64 _ under this representation _ :",

    "2})}^3 \\cos({{\\theta } _ 3}){\\sin({{\\theta } _ 3})}^5 d\\theta_3 d\\phi_3 \\ldots d\\theta_1 d\\phi_1.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the _ equivalent _ aspect of our statement comes in when one explicitly evaluates equation ( [ eq : dvpurestates ] ) for @xmath55 : @xmath66 where the ranges on the @xmath67 s are from equation ( [ eq : cpnranges1 ] ) .",
    "obviously there s some contradiction between this measure and the one given in equation but any concern it may raise should be eliminated in the following work .    to begin we note that equation ( [ eq : dvpurestatesforcp3 ] )",
    "can also be derived in the following manner that follows the arguments found in @xcite .",
    "first we define a pure state as @xmath68 and then apply a @xmath69 to yield @xmath70 recalling that a general two qubit density matrix has the form @xmath71 we can therefore solve for the components of @xmath72 and in turn @xmath73 , via evaluating @xmath74 for @xmath75 . doing these calculations yields ( dropping an overall multiplicative phase term dependent on the @xmath76 element of the cartan subalgebra found in @xmath77 ) @xmath78 calculating and taking the determinant of the fubini - study metric as before but now _ under this representation _ yields the following invariant measure for @xmath64 @xmath79    one can see that @xmath80 is similar to @xmath81 but not equal . therefore in comparing the two measures we can only note the following :    1 .",
    "the factor of 2 in equation ( [ eq : dvpurestatesforcp3 ] ) equates to having the range of @xmath82 run from @xmath83 to @xmath84 rather than its original range set @xmath85 given in equation ( [ eq : cpnranges1 ] ) thus allowing one to _ conceptually _ equate @xmath86 with @xmath87 and @xmath88 with a functional form of the @xmath89s .",
    "2 .   equation can be generalized to @xmath2 ( see @xcite ) @xmath90 which obviously _ does not _ have the same form as equation ( [ eq : dvpurestates ] ) , but due to the invariance of the integral @xmath91 _ does _ yield the same invariant volume ( see the next section and @xcite ) .",
    "thus the difference between the two pure state measures is just in the way one initially chooses the distribution of the angles @xmath92 and @xmath93 in the space @xmath64 ( and in @xmath2 in general ) .",
    "since we are most concerned with unitary operators in @xmath0 acting upon pure state density matrices and not within the more general @xmath1 group , we feel that our representation of the pure state measure is more useful with regards to the overall euler parameterization of @xmath0 and @xmath1 than the one given in equation .",
    "from equation we can see that , in general , one can write down the mixed - state product measure for @xmath94 as @xmath95 where @xmath96 defines a measure in the ( @xmath97)-dimensional symplex of eigenvalues of @xmath98 and @xmath99 , where @xmath100 and @xmath101 , defines a `` truncated '' haar measure which is responsible for the choice of eigenvectors of @xmath102 that ensures @xmath96 is `` rotational invariant . ''",
    "now as @xcite and others have noted , @xmath96 is defined via the probability distribution induced on the ( @xmath97)-dimensional symplex but there can be more than one possible @xmath96 that is applicable for a given system since there can be more than one usable probability distribution . as hall noted :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ... [ i]f [ mixed states ] described by density operators are allowed , the requirement of unitary invariance ( thus there is no preferred measurement basis for extracting information ) only implies that the probability measure over the set of possible states is a function of the density operator eigenvalue spectrum alone .",
    "hence a unique probability measure can be specified only via some further principle or restriction , to be motivated on physical or conceptual grounds @xcite . _",

    "since there are multiple choices for distance measures between two density matrices , and therefore @xmath96 , and since we want to keep our discussion as general as possible , we shall defer further discussion on @xmath96 to other papers ( for example those previously cited ) and just use the most general form of @xmath96 in the spirit equation and given in @xcite and references within ; the dirichlet distribution : @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are just the eigenvalues of @xmath98 .",
    "the dirichlet distribution provides a means of expressing quantities that vary randomly , independent of each other , yet obeying the condition that there sum remains fixed . in our case , @xmath106 thus @xmath107 where the ranges for the @xmath108 , we conjecture , are equal to @xmath109 these ranges disagree with those given by slater in @xcite for @xmath110 but under integration , the difference between those in @xcite and ours is a multiplicative factor of @xmath3 upon the kernel .",
    "the benefit of the ranges given here is that they are easily generalized , while those in @xcite are not .    with @xmath96",
    "so defined , we are now free to look at the flag manifold @xmath111 . by using equations and ( [ eq : sun ] ) we can see that the coset @xmath111 can be expressed as @xmath112 where @xmath113 is defined in equation ( [ eq : sun ] ) .",
    "this coset representation comes from the following observation ; it allows us to write down the `` truncated '' haar measure @xmath114 as @xmath115 where from @xcite @xmath116 and @xmath117 is from equation ( [ eq : sun ] ) .",
    "now the ranges for the @xmath118 s can again be either the _ covering _ ranges defined for the first @xmath119 @xmath118 s of the euler parameterization of @xmath0 ( see @xcite ) _ or _ the @xmath120 ranges @xmath121 which would necessitate adding a normalization factor of @xmath122 to @xmath123 in equation ( [ eq : dghmeasure ] ) .    depending on which set of ranges",
    "are used , a general mixed - state product measure can thus be written as @xmath124 where the @xmath125 are the _ non - zero _ eigenvalues of the corresponding @xmath3-dimensional diagonal density matrix @xmath98 ( see @xcite for more details ) and @xmath126 is the necessary normalization constant ( equal to 1 if one uses the covering ranges for @xmath0 and equal to @xmath122 if one uses the generic @xmath127 coset ranges used in calculating the group volume @xcite .      for two qubits , equations , ( [ eq : dmu ] ) , and ( [ eq : dghmeasure ] )",
    "yield @xmath128 where we have used the @xmath129 differential volume element from @xcite in the last step .",
    "the ranges of integration for the @xmath67 parameters has already been discussed ; ideally they should be the _ covering _ ranges for @xmath129 from @xcite so that @xmath130 . as for the ranges on @xmath96 , recall that for two qubits , @xmath98 is given by @xcite @xmath131 where @xmath132 thus we have @xmath133 for the ranges of integration on @xmath96 .",
    "notice that one could have also used equation with @xmath110 to achieve these ranges , but it is instructive to see their explicit derivation .",
    "now we are in a position to give two different methods for calculating the volume for the pure and mixed state manifolds of general @xmath3-dimensional quantum systems .",
    "the pure state manifold volume is quite simple and already well known ; it is the volume of @xmath2 , while the mixed state manifold volume , as we have seen in the previous section , is the product of two different measures - one of which is dependent on the initial distribution of states on the ( @xmath97)-dimensional symplex .",
    "therefore in the mixed state case we shall only worry about calculating the volume contribution from the second measure ; the `` truncated '' haar measure , since the volume from the @xmath97 symplex measure can be equated to a general multiplicative constant determined by the initial distribution of states on the @xmath97 symplex ( see for example @xcite ) : @xmath135 for example , for the two qubit case described previously , a naive calculation of @xmath136 can be seen to be equal to : @xmath137 for when @xmath138 ( note that the integration ranges on @xmath139 were reversed in order to keep @xmath136 positive ) .      using the results for @xmath1 we can immediately write down the general volume for @xmath2 . using equations , and ( [ eq : unvol ] )",
    "we have @xmath140 we see that this result also comes from the integration of equation ( [ eq : dvpurestates ] ) over the ranges given in equation ( [ eq : cpnranges1 ] ) or equation ( [ eq : cpnranges2 ] ) @xmath141 where @xmath142 is , from @xcite , @xmath143 expansion of this product yields @xmath144 which when multiplied by the @xmath145 factor gives the volume for @xmath2 as previously calculated .",
    "one can also see that integration of equation using the ranges given for @xmath92 in equation will also generate equation ( [ eq : cpnvol ] ) ( see @xcite for example ) .",
    "we should also note the remarkable results : @xmath146 thus , in terms of our pure state manifold discussion , we can conclude that as one increases the dimensionality of the system , there will always be a non - zero pure state volume . in the spirit of this result",
    "we should also note an interesting introduction to the importance of the pure state manifold @xmath2 for large @xmath3 , especially with regard to quantum entanglement , can be found in @xcite .",
    "recall that the action of a group in the adjoint representation produces interesting orbits ; the manifolds of which are called _ generalized flag manifolds _ , and appear very often in geometric quantization , density matrices , entangled states , etc .",
    "these manifolds can be represented by the coset @xmath147 ; obviously then the volume of such manifolds are quite important to our work . by using equations and ( [ eq : msflagdef ] ) we can write down the general volume for such a coset , @xmath148 , as @xmath149 but we know @xmath150 thus we can see that @xmath151 which is in agreement with @xcite .",
    "this volume can also be generated via integrating the `` truncated '' haar measure , using the appropriate ranges and normalization conditions , given in equation ( [ eq : dghmeasure ] ) ( done in detail in @xcite ) .",
    "for completeness , and with equation in mind , we should note the following : @xmath152 thus equation has the following , equivalent representation @xmath153 so the volume of our flag manifold is nothing more than the product of the volumes of the complex projective space @xmath154 where @xmath155 @xcite .",
    "notice also that as @xmath3 increases the volume of the flag manifold approaches , but _ never equals _ , zero ( see equation ( [ eq : cpnobs ] ) ) .",
    "it is an asymptotic limit which converges to zero from the left on @xmath156 .",
    "thus , since one _ usually _ chooses a non - zero probability distribution on the @xmath97 symplex defining @xmath96 ( see equation ( [ eq : dmu ] ) ) , we can conclude that , as in the pure state case , the mixed state volume measure will never equal zero _ unless @xmath157 does _ !",
    "beyond the full pure and mixed state manifolds there are numerous other sub - manifolds that are of interest in physics ; the volumes of which have already been calculated ( see , for example , @xcite and references within ) . these sub - manifolds and their volumes give us both a way to confirm our methodology , as well as offering a systematic , rather than numeric , way of computing such quantities . from this work",
    "we will then be able to calculate the manifolds that contain the set of entangled and mixed states ( either pure or mixed ) for specific quantum systems @xcite .",
    "it should be understood though that the following volume calculations are specific to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 euler angle parameterization that we have developed and its corresponding normalizations via the cartan subalgebra being used .",
    "the general question of volume normalization of a manifold , especially when one begins to talk about coset manifolds with specific elements of the cartan subalgebra being removed will be the subject of a future paper .      to begin , we would like to be able to write down the general volume of the @xmath160 coset where @xmath161 and @xmath162 . to do this we can use equation to generate @xmath163 when @xmath164 we have @xmath165      defining @xmath110 , and @xmath167 , we get from equation ( [ eq : volsunsupsuq ] ) the volume of the coset @xmath166 @xmath168 which is equivalent to the volume of @xmath129 , @xmath169 , divided by the square of the volume of @xmath35 , @xmath170 , as expected .",
    "it should also be noted that this is the volume of the manifold that is comprised of all _ non - local _ transformations which can be implemented on a two qubit system .      beyond the general volume of @xmath2 , general flag manifold , and the previous @xmath0 coset , we would like to be able to write down the general volume of the @xmath171 coset where @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "to do this we can use equations and ( [ eq : unvol ] ) as follows @xmath174 the problem we now face is how to define @xmath9 .",
    "if we use equation , here now defined for @xmath0 , we would generate @xmath175 if we demand that @xmath176 , we can simplify the product terms @xmath177 as well as the powers and other factors . therefore , for this case we have @xmath178 depending on which parameter is used .",
    "now , if in using equation , we now define @xmath9 for @xmath179 , @xmath180 , we would generate @xmath181 and if we demand @xmath176 , we can simplify , yielding @xmath182 which reduces to equation ( [ eq : firstcosetvol ] ) when @xmath183 .",
    "therefore , depending on which @xmath9 we use , we will generate a different volume ; the ratio between any two being equal to @xmath184      defining @xmath110 and @xmath187 ( thus satisfying @xmath188 we get from equation ( [ eq : secondcosetvol ] ) the volume of the coset @xmath189 when @xmath190 @xmath191 when @xmath192 @xmath193 and when @xmath194 the volume of the coset @xmath195 , using equation ( [ eq : firstcosetvol ] ) now , is @xmath196      now we would like to be able to write down the general volume of the @xmath197 coset for @xmath198 and @xmath162 . to do this",
    "we can use equations and ( [ eq : unvol ] ) as follows @xmath199 simplification yields @xmath200 for the special case when @xmath201 we can go further and eliminate the @xmath3 dependence in the above volume , thus yielding ( in one possible representation ) @xmath202      defining @xmath204 , and @xmath205 , thus satisfying @xmath206 , we get from equation ( [ eq : sunupuqcoset ] ) the volume of the coset @xmath207 to be equal to @xmath208 which is what one would get if they used equations and ( [ eq : unvol ] ) separately .",
    "we are now ready to write down the volume for the most general of cosets that we are interested in , @xmath209 , where @xmath210 and @xmath211 where there is no necessary order in the sequential choice of @xmath212 .",
    "to begin we note the following using equation ( [ eq : unvol ] ) @xmath213 we also can simplify the second volume of the three we need via generalizing equation @xmath214 we are now in a position to write down the volume for @xmath209 . using equations , , ( [ eq : denom1 ] ) , and ( [ eq : denom2 ] ) we have @xmath215 for the special case when",
    "the `` @xmath216 '' in equation is replaced by `` @xmath217 '' we have @xmath218 one could continue simplifying equation but it would be only worthwhile if additional knowledge concerning @xmath219 and @xmath220 was available .",
    "the general grassmann manifolds , of which @xmath2 is a special case ( see equation ) , have the following definition for @xmath221 @xmath222 using equation ( [ eq : unvol ] ) we can write down the general expression for the volume of _ almost _ any grassmann manifold : @xmath223 the reason for the `` almost '' above is that for @xmath224 we regain the volume for @xmath225 that we originally calculated in equation ( [ eq : cpnvol ] ) : @xmath226 we are `` off '' by a factor of @xmath227 which occurs because of the following reason : equation ( [ eq : unvol ] ) , for @xmath33 , yields @xmath84 which is correct _ if _ one is looking for the volume of the @xmath35 variant of @xmath9 ( see equation for @xmath33 ) , but that is _ not _ the case for the @xmath9 components of greater @xmath0 groups ( again see equation for @xmath228 ) , which is the case here . in equation ( [ eq : cpnwrongvol ] )",
    "we get the factor of @xmath84 from the @xmath9 component , but without the additional contraction term due to the @xmath20 cartan subalgebra component of @xmath1 from which the @xmath9 term is defined !    the flaw in equation ( [ eq : cpnwrongvol ] ) can also be seen from equation : @xmath229 the @xmath9 term in the numerator is the same as the @xmath9 term in the denominator and as such , in any representation , cancels out , thus leaving the standard coset relationship for @xmath230 which , from equation ( [ eq : cpnvol ] ) , does yield the correct volume for @xmath230 . therefore , if we use equation for the @xmath9 term in equation ( [ eq : grassvol ] ) ( combined with equation ( [ eq : unvol ] ) for the other two terms ) when @xmath224 , we will generate the correct volume for @xmath230 @xmath231 therefore , in general , if we demand that @xmath232 then equation ( [ eq : grassvol ] ) will correctly produce the grassmann manifold volumes ( see @xcite and references within ) .",
    "using the volume equations given herein , we are now in a position to explicitly write down the measures and volumes for the whole range of manifolds which occur in discussions concerning separability and entanglement of multi - particle systems .",
    "therefore , this work allows us to explicitly write down the volumes of the manifolds of the local orbits of a given state @xmath233 with respect to some transformation @xmath234 ( or more generally @xmath1 ) , in a manner that we hypothesize also elucidates the topology of the manifolds as well @xcite .",
    "applications beyond quantum information theory are also possible @xcite .",
