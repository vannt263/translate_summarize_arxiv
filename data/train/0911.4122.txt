    "from the theoretical point of view the baryogenesis via leptogenesis scenario @xcite is a very attractive explanation of the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "one of its key ingredients is heavy majorana neutrinos , whose _",
    "cp_violating decays are responsible for the generation of a lepton asymmetry , i.e.  for leptogenesis .",
    "cp_-violating parameter receives contributions from the vertex @xcite and self - energy @xcite diagrams . if the masses of the heavy neutrinos are strongly hierarchical , then the two contributions are comparable . however ,",
    "if the mass spectrum is quasidegenerate then the self - energy contribution is resonantly enhanced and becomes considerably larger than the one from the vertex diagram .",
    "the resonant enhancement of the _ cp_-violating parameter allows one to bring the scale of leptogenesis down to @xmath0 tev @xcite .",
    "this scenario is very interesting from the experimental point of view since it is potentially accessible in accelerator experiments @xcite .    in state - of - the - art calculations",
    "the self - energy _ cp_-violating parameter is evaluated in _ vacuum _ and then used to calculate the asymmetry generated by the decays of the heavy neutrinos in the _ hot and dense medium_. in this approximation the possibly important medium effects are neglected from the very beginning .",
    "one can take them into account systematically by using the schwinger ",
    "keldysh / kadanoff  baym formalism @xcite or approximate self - consistent equations derived from the kadanoff  baym equations ( see @xcite for related work ) .    the kadanoff ",
    "baym formalism provides a powerful framework for studying nonequilibrium processes within quantum field theory .",
    "however , it is technically considerably more involved than the canonical boltzmann approach . for this reason",
    ", we apply it here to a simple toy model which we have already used in @xcite to investigate the vertex contribution .",
    "the lagrangian contains one complex and two real scalar fields : @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath3 . here and",
    "in the following we assume summation over repeating indices , unless otherwise specified .",
    "despite its simplicity , the model incorporates all features relevant for leptogenesis .",
    "the real scalar fields imitate the ( two lightest ) heavy right - handed neutrinos , whereas the complex scalar field models the baryons . the @xmath4 symmetry , which we use to define `` baryon '' number , is explicitly broken by the presence of the last two terms , just as the @xmath5 symmetry is explicitly broken by majorana mass terms in phenomenological models .",
    "thus the first sakharov condition @xcite is fulfilled .",
    "the couplings @xmath6 model the complex yukawa couplings of the right - handed neutrinos to leptons and the higgs . by rephasing the complex scalar field at least one of the couplings",
    "@xmath6 can be made real .",
    "if @xmath7 the other one remains complex and there is _ cp_-violation , as is required by the second sakharov condition . in vacuum the self - energy contribution to the _ cp_-violating parameter is given by : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the decay width of the heavy scalar @xmath10 .",

    "the formalism employed in @xcite leads to a slightly different expression for the _ cp_-violating parameter ( see appendix [ cpclassic ] for more details ) .",
    "the required deviation from thermal equilibrium is caused by the rapid expansion of the universe .",
    "thus the third sakharov condition is fulfilled as well .",
    "finally , the quartic self - interaction term in plays the role of the yukawa and gauge interactions in established models ",
    "it brings the `` baryons '' to equilibrium .",
    "the renormalizability of the theory requires the presence of some additional terms , which are accounted for by @xmath11 .    here , we study the self - energy contribution to the _ cp_-violating parameter in the hierarchical and quasidegenerate cases using the schwinger  keldysh / kadanoff  baym formalism as starting point . to make the discussion less technical we give the details of the calculation in the appendixes , whereas in the main body of the paper we sketch the derivation and present the results .    * as we argue in sec.[cpviol ] , the formalism is free of the double - counting problem typical for the canonical boltzmann approach . in other words",
    "the structure of the equations automatically ensures that the asymmetry vanishes in thermal equilibrium and no need for the real intermediate state ( ris ) subtraction arises .",
    "this property has already been observed in case of the vertex contribution . *",
    "the medium corrections to the _ cp_-violating parameter are only linear in the particle number densities .",
    "that is , our result differs from that obtained previously in the framework of equilibrium thermal field theory by replacing the zero temperature propagators with finite temperature propagators in the matrix elements used in the boltzmann equation .",
    "* for scalars the medium effects always increase the _",
    "cp_-violating parameter , which in turn leads to an enhancement of the generated asymmetry . *",
    "the canonical expression for the _ cp_-violating parameter is only applicable in the hierarchical case even though it does not diverge in the limit of equal masses .",
    "for quasidegenerate masses one has to take into account quantum corrections to the effective masses and decay widths of the heavy particles in medium , which leads to a modified expression for the _ cp_-violating parameter . * in the resonant regime quantum corrections also lead to an enhancement of the total _ in - medium _ decay widths .",
    "this results in a faster decay of the heavy particles and can increase the importance of the washout process . * in the maximal resonant regime the boltzmann picture breaks down and we argue that an analysis in the full kadanoff ",

    "if the distance between the peaks of the spectral function is considerably larger than the decay widths , the integration reduces to two independent integrations in the vicinities of the corresponding mass shells .",
    "thus , we can identify two independent quasiparticle excitations with the corresponding distribution functions @xmath226 and @xmath227 and the _ cp_-violating parameters @xmath157 and @xmath228 which contribute to the generation of the asymmetry . on the other hand , if the decay width is comparable to the difference of the masses , then the peaks of the spectral functions overlap and neither the distribution functions , nor the _ cp_-violating parameters , are well - defined .",

    "the shape of the diagonal components deviates from the breit - wigner one , and the positions of the peaks of @xmath232 are shifted as compared to those for the diagonal spectral function @xmath225 . in other words , using the boltzmann equation for the diagonal propagators @xmath233 to calculate the generated asymmetry is no longer a good approximation because of the off - shell effects .",
    "moreover , since the microscopic time scales @xmath234 and the macroscopic time scales @xmath235 can be of the same order of magnitude in the `` maximal resonant '' regime , the memory effects can play an important role .",

    "thus , in the vacuum limit the _ cp_-violating parameter is approximately given by @xmath249 compared to the conventional result the width in the denominator is effectively changed according to @xmath250 .",
    "since @xmath251 , this means that for fixed values of @xmath252 and @xmath253 the result above is always larger compared to the conventional one .",
    "this property may be attributed to the fact that the kadanoff ",

    "in general , the thermal corrections could also be larger than the mass - splitting of the vacuum masses .",

    "this treatment , based on nonequilibrium quantum field theory techniques , is motivated by the fact that it allows a unified description of two key ingredients of leptogenesis , namely deviation from thermal equilibrium and loop - induced _ cp_-violation .",
    "we find that the structure of the kinetic equations automatically ensures that no asymmetry is produced in thermal equilibrium .",
    "in other words there is no need for the real intermediate state subtraction , i.e.  the formalism is free of the double - counting problem typical for the canonical approach .",
    "one of the key quantities in leptogenesis is the _ cp_-violating parameter .",
    "earlier studies have shown that there are two sources of _ cp_-violation , the vertex and the self - energy contribution . in this work ,",
    "we have concentrated on the latter .",
    "we have found that for scalar fields medium effects increase the self - energy contribution to the _ cp_-violating parameter .",
    "contrary to the results obtained earlier in the framework of thermal field theory by replacing the zero temperature propagators with finite temperature propagators in the matrix elements of the boltzmann equation , the medium corrections depend only linearly on the particle number densities .",
    "although the formal description of the self - energy and vertex contributions to the _ cp_-violating parameter is technically quite different , the results for both are very similar qualitatively and , in the hierarchical case , even quantitatively . in this work",
    ", we additionally studied the quasidegenerate case , for which the self - energy contribution is essential .",
    "we have shown that the canonical expression for the self - energy _ cp_-violating parameter is only applicable in the hierarchical case , even though it does not diverge in the limit of equal masses . in the resonant regime",
    "the interactions modify the mass spectrum of the quasiparticle excitations .",
    "furthermore , using the kadanoff ",
    "baym formalism , it is possible to take a resummation of resonant contributions into account .",
    "both effects lead to changes in the expression for the _ cp_-violating parameter . for moderate values of the degeneracy parameter",
    "@xmath252 the resonance corrections can enhance the _ cp_-violating parameter by a factor of two .",
    "therefore , it is important to take these corrections into account in numerical simulations .",
    "another important effect is the resonant and medium enhancement of the total decay widths .",
    "it leads to a faster decay of the heavy particles and more efficient washout of the generated asymmetry .",
    "therefore , the increase in the generated asymmetry due to the enhancement of the _ cp_-violating parameter can be partially compensated by the increase of the in - medium decay widths .    in the `` maximal resonant '' regime",
    "the boltzmann picture is no longer applicable .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact , that in this regime the peaks of the spectral functions of the heavy ( toy-)neutrino fields overlap and it is no longer possible to unambiguously define quasiparticles and one - particle distribution functions . furthermore , the off - diagonal components of the correlation functions no longer have two pronounced peaks and therefore it is not possible to describe the mixing effects in terms of the corresponding on - shell _ cp_-violating parameters . consequently , in this regime the calculation of the generated asymmetry requires us to use at least two - by - two matrix equations for the diagonal and off - diagonal components of the propagators of the heavy fields with ( in general ) off - shell momenta",
    ". these can be obtained from the quantum kinetic equations by dropping the poisson brackets on the right - hand side .",
    "furthermore , since the microscopic time scales @xmath234 and the macroscopic time scales @xmath235 can be of the same order of magnitude in the maximal resonant regime , memory effects can play an important role . taking both off - shell _ and",
    "_ memory effects into account consistently requires the use of the full system of kadanoff  baym equations .",
    "the formalism developed in this paper also provides a powerful tool for analyzing quantum nonequilibrium effects induced by the expansion of the early universe . in particular",
    ", there is a small additional `` spontaneous '' contribution to the _ cp_-violation in the system similar to that encountered in electroweak baryogenesis @xcite this effect will be investigated in a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "this work was supported by the `` sonderforschungsbereich '' tr27 and by the `` cluster of excellence origin and structure of the universe '' .",
    "we would like to thank j.berges , j-s.gagnon , a.ibarra and m.m.mller for helpful comments and discussions .",
    "in this appendix , we review the calculation of the self - energy contribution to the _ cp_-violating parameter in vacuum , @xmath347 , in the conventional in - out formalism .    since the toy - majoranas are unstable , they can not appear as in- or out - states of s - matrix elements . instead",
    ", their properties are defined by s - matrix elements for scattering of stable particles mediated by the unstable neutrino @xcite . resumming the propagator of the intermediate heavy state , we can separate two - body scattering processes in resonance contributions and the rest .",
    "the _ cp_-violating part of the resonance contribution can then be interpreted as a characteristic of the on - shell intermediate toy - majorana @xcite .",

    "this implies that the renormalized self - energy is given by @xmath363 in the on - shell renormalization scheme the _ dispersive _ parts of the components of the renormalized self - energy must satisfy the conditions        [ pirenvacexpl ] @xmath365\\,,\\\\ \\pi_{ren}^{ij}&=\\frac{{{\\rm re}}(g_ig_j^*)}{16\\pi^2}\\left [ \\frac{p^2-m_i^2}{m_j^2-m_i^2}\\ln\\frac{|p^2|}{m_j^2}\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & \\hspace{1.2cm}+\\left.\\frac{p^2-m_j^2}{m_i^2-m_j^2}\\ln \\frac{|p^2|}{m_i^2 } -i\\pi\\theta(p^2 ) \\right]\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]        because of the presence of absorptive terms in the determinant of the inverse propagator in has two poles in the complex plane at @xmath367 where @xmath368 is the tree - level decay width of @xmath24 . expanding around the poles and substituting the leading expansion terms",
