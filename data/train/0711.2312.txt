    "the interpretation of existing and future observations is complicated by the fact that ly@xmath0 photons are typically scattered both in the interstellar medium ( ism , e.g. hansen & oh 2006 ) as well as in the intergalactic medium ( igm , loeb & rybicki 1999 ; santos 2004 ; dijkstra et al 2007b ) .",
    "the impact of scattering on the observed ly@xmath0 flux and spectrum may be derived by careful modeling of the observed ly@xmath0 line profile , combined with constraints on the galaxy s stellar population derived from its broad band colors @xcite .",

    "of course , it is not obvious whether local starburst galaxies are representative of high - redshift ly@xmath0 emitters ( laes ) , and detailed modeling of the line profile may be hampered by the quality of the data of high - redshift laes .    in this paper",

    "the goal of this paper is to demonstrate that ly@xmath0 radiation may be highly polarized around high - redshift galaxies in a broad range of cosmological circumstances .",
    "we will show that ly@xmath0 polarimetry may place constraints on the kinematics of the gas through which the photons propagate .",
    "this is important : understanding the impact of scattering in both the ism and igm on the observed ly@xmath0 properties is required to fully exploit ly@xmath0 observations as a probe of the high - redshift universe .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the possibility of separating ly@xmath0 sources from low - redshift line emitters ( such as [ oii ] , [ oiii ] , h@xmath0 , h@xmath6 emitters , and oh - skylines ) based on polarimetry .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in   [ sec : lya ] we describe the basic principles of ly@xmath0 radiative transfer and polarization , and how polarization is incorporated in our radiative transfer calculations . in   [",
    "sec : result ] we present our main numerical results . in ",
    "[ sec : discuss ] we discuss our results and their implications , before presenting our final conclusions in   [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the parameters for the background cosmology used throughout this paper are @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "we start by summarizing the basic principles of ly@xmath0 scattering .",
    "we express photon frequency @xmath8 in terms of a dimensionless variable @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the thermal velocity of the hydrogen atoms in the gas , given by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath14 k the gas temperature , @xmath15 the proton mass and @xmath16 hz is the ly@xmath0 resonance frequency . for reference ,",
    "the optical depth through a column of hydrogen , @xmath17 , for a photon in the line center , @xmath18 , is given by @xmath19 the optical depth for a photon at a frequency @xmath20 reduces to @xmath21 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where @xmath22 is the voigt parameter given by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 s@xmath25 is the einstein a - coefficient for the transition .",
    "the transition between ` wing ' and ` core ' occurs at @xmath26 for @xmath14 k.    under most astrophysical conditions , absorption of a ly@xmath0 photon is followed be re  emission of a photon of the same energy in the frame of the atom .",
    "however , in the observer s frame the ly@xmath0 photon s energy before and after scattering is modified by doppler shift due to the thermal motion of the atom , and scattering is only partially coherent in the observer s frame .",
    "these doppler shifts are important as they cause the photon s frequency to change by an _",
    "rms _ shift of @xmath27 per scattering event @xcite .",
    "therefore , ly@xmath0 scattering through an optically thick medium can be described as a sequence of random walks in both frequency and real space ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "frequency diffusion is very efficient and spatial diffusion occurs predominantly when photons are in the wing of the line profile ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hence , the last scattering event occurs in the wing of the line profile for the majority of ly@xmath0 photons emerging from an optically thick medium .",
    "photons typically scatter only @xmath28 times before emerging from a medium of optical depth @xmath18 , as opposed to the @xmath29-scaling , that is expected in the absence of frequency diffusion . for scattering events that occur in the wing ,",
    "a so called restoring force pushes the photon back towards the core by an average amount of @xmath30 @xcite . ]    other quantities of relevance to our discussion are : ( _ i _ ) the scattering phase function ( also known as the anisotropy function ) which gives the probability @xmath31 that the scattered photon is re  emitted at an angle @xmath32 relative to the incoming photon ; and ( _ ii _ ) the degree of polarization @xmath33 caused by scattering which is defined as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the intensities parallel and perpendicular to the plane of scattering ( defined by the wave vectors of the ingoing and outgoing photons ) , as a function scattering angle @xmath32 .",

    "+ @xcite assigned 100% linear polarization to individual photons by endowing each ly@xmath0 photon with a polarization vector @xmath51 , which is perpendicular to the photon s propagation direction @xmath52 , i.e. @xmath53 . in this formulation",

    "the actual weight of each process is angle dependent ( see appendix  [ app : super ] ) . in other words , in the case of resonant scattering the intensities in radial and azimuthal directions are obtained by scaling down the intensities obtained from rayleigh scattering by a factor of @xmath77 , and by adding an unpolarized intensity of magnitude @xmath78 .",

    "monte - carlo calculations of ly@xmath0 transfer can be accelerated by skipping scattering events that occur in the line core ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "one has to be somewhat careful when applying this technique in calculations of polarization , as it reduces the number of scattering events that a ly@xmath0 photon encounters and hence distorts its resulting polarization state .",
    "however , we have verified explicitly that the polarization properties of ly@xmath0 emerging from optically thick clouds are correctly calculated by the accelerated scheme .",
    "generally speaking , the accelerated monte - carlo scheme yields the correct polarization whenever this scheme reliably computes other observable quantities such as the spectrum and surface brightness profile .",
    "lastly , we point out that the expressions for @xmath31 and @xmath33 in   [ sec : rt2 ] were derived under the assumption that the radiation field prior to the scattering event was unpolarized .",
    "the precise functional forms of @xmath31 and @xmath33 are different when the radiation field prior to scattering is polarized ( see appendix a1 ) .",
    "the procedure of propagating the polarization vector in a single rayleigh scattering event that was outlined above , naturally accounts for the polarization dependence of @xmath33 and @xmath31 ( see appendix a3 ) . for resonantly scattered ly@xmath0",
    "the situation is more complex and the density matrix formalism should be used ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the precise dependence of @xmath31 and @xmath33 on initial polarization does not affect the calculations regarding resonant scattering .",
    "the maximum fractional polarization we find for resonantly scattered ly@xmath0 is @xmath86 ( see   [ sec : igm ] ) .",
    "the typical polarization of the ly@xmath0 radiation field seen by atoms involved in the scattering process is even lower .",
    "this only introduces changes in the phase function at the level of a few per cent , and we have verified that our results regarding resonantly scattered ly@xmath0 are insensitive to the precise form of the phase function .",
    "next we calculate the expected polarization of the ly@xmath0 line in a set of models which span the likely environments of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we assume the redshift of ly@xmath0 sources to be @xmath87 in all cases .",
    "the monte - carlo radiative transfer calculations rely on stacking individual photons into bins , and the errorbars shown in some figures were calculated assuming poisson fluctuations in the number of photons within a given bin .",
    "a major fraction of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at high redshifts show evidence of being surrounded by outflowing enriched gas @xcite .",
    "scattering of ly@xmath0 photons by neutral hydrogen atoms in these outflows may cause the observed ly@xmath0 line to be redshifted systematically relative to the systemic velocity of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "this redshift is attributed to the doppler boost that ly@xmath0 photons experience when they scatter off the outflow on the far side of the galaxy back towards the observer ( hence the term backscattering ) .",
    "this redshifted ly@xmath0 flux is less prone to resonant scattering in the igm , and is therefore more easily observable than ly@xmath0 photons that were not backscattered .",
    "the impact of the outflow on the observable properties of the ly@xmath0 line depends on various parameters including the outflow speed , @xmath88 , the total column density of neutral hydrogen atoms in the outflow , @xmath17 , and the dust content and distribution inside the outflow @xcite .",
    "we show results for a single expanding thin shell of gas with @xmath89 @xmath90 and @xmath91 @xmath90 , based on column densities that are observed in ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies @xcite .",
    "we discuss the choice of our model in more detail after presenting our results below .",
    "the outflow speed is typically of order the circular velocity of the host dark matter halo , @xmath92 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we assume the galaxy to be embedded in a halo of total mass @xmath93 , which corresponds to @xmath94 km s@xmath25 .",
    "the emitted ly@xmath0 spectrum prior to scattering is assumed to be a gaussian with a velocity width @xmath95 @xcite and is denoted by the _ dotted line _ in the _ left panel _ of figure  [ fig : back ] .",
    "the _ dashed ( solid ) lines _ represent the observed spectrum for an outflow with @xmath89 @xmath90 ( @xmath96 @xmath90 ) .",
    "the figure shows that backscattering off the expanding outflow results in a systematic redshift of the ly@xmath0 line ( as mentioned above ) , with an increase in redshift as @xmath17 increases .",
    "the _ top right panel _ shows that the surface brightness profile remains flat out to some value of @xmath97 after which it drops to zero ( as there is no scattering outside the shell ) .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath98 and the surface brightness @xmath99 are determined by the radius of the expanding shell .",
    "for example , if the outflow is located at a distance @xmath100 kpc from the central galaxy ( and its thickness @xmath101 ) , then the surface brightness profile drops to zero at @xmath102 for a galaxy at @xmath87 .",
    "the mean surface brightness scales approximately shows that the surface brightness remains almost constant out to @xmath103 . the mean surface brightness , @xmath104 ,",
    "was therefore estimated by dividing the total scattered flux by @xmath105 . ] as @xmath106 erg s@xmath25 @xmath90 arcsec@xmath107 , where @xmath108 for @xmath89 @xmath90 , and @xmath109 for @xmath91@xmath90 .",
    "the _ bottom right panel _ shows that the fractional polarization , @xmath110 , increases towards larger values of @xmath0 and reaches a maximum near @xmath98 .",
    "the polarization amplitude obtains values as high as @xmath1 for @xmath89 @xmath90 , and @xmath111 for @xmath91 @xmath90 .",
    "the reason for the overall large values of the polarization is easy to understand .",
    "although the line center optical depth through the outflow is very large for both models , @xmath112 ( see eq  [ eq : tau0 ] ) , most photons reside in the wings of the line profile when they reach the expanding shell . for example , in the model with @xmath89 @xmath90 , the optical depth is less than unity for @xmath113 of the photons when they enter the outflow for the first time",
    ". therefore , most photons scatter only once in the wing of the line profile before escaping to the observer .",
    "the above interpretation is quantified by figure  [ fig : nscat ] , in which the _ thick solid line _ shows the probability distribution for the number of scattering events encountered by the ly@xmath0 photons , @xmath114 .",
    "the function @xmath114 peaks at @xmath115 and rapidly decreases for increasing @xmath116 .",
    "also shown as the _ histogram _ is the angle - averaged polarization of the photons as a function of @xmath116 .",
    "the polarization is largest for photons that scatter only once ( @xmath117 ) , and nearly vanishes for @xmath118 .",
    "the decrease in the polarization amplitude with increasing @xmath116 reflects that the radiation field becomes increasingly isotropic as the number of scattering events increases . as @xmath17 increases , the fraction of photons that escape after a single scatter decreases , and the overall polarization declines .",
    "figure  [ fig : impact ] shows the frequency dependence of the polarization at three different impact parameters , namely @xmath119 ( _ thin black histogram _ ) , @xmath120 ( _ red dashed histogram _ ) , and @xmath98 ( _ blue dotted histogram _ ) .",
    "as already illustrated in figure  [ fig : back ] , the polarization increases with increasing impact parameter .",
    "the _ thick solid line _ shows the observed spectrum which was previously shown in fig  [ fig : back ] .",
    "the bulk of photons have frequencies @xmath121 . within this frequency range",
    ", the polarization increases towards the red .",
    "this is because the redder ly@xmath0 photons appear farther from resonance in the frame of the gas ; they therefore scatter less and achieve a higher polarization amplitude ( see fig  [ fig : nscat ] ) .",
    "this frequency dependence of the polarization can be used as a fingerprint to distinguish outflows from infall ( see   [ sec : cool ] ) .",
    "one may wonder whether the above results depend sensitively on the assumed model : e.g. do the result change for a continuous , dusty , wind with a radial dependence of its outflow speed ?",
    "a wind for which the outflow speed increases linearly with radius would resemble the igm with a hubble flow as discussed in @xcite , who found even higher levels of polarization .",
    "furthermore , scattering through an optically thick _ collapsing _ gas cloud also results in a comparable polarization ( @xmath122 , see   [ sec : cool ] ) .",
    "changing the sign of the velocity of the gas only affects the frequency dependence of the polarization ( see   [ sec : cool ] ) .",
    "the column density of neutral hydrogen in both these models is @xmath123 @xmath90 , which implies that polarized ly@xmath0 is also expected for outflow models with larger column densities and non - zero velocity gradients .",
    "furthermore , the presence of dust in the expanding wind can boost the polarization .",
    "the reason is that photons that scatter only once obtain the highest level of polarization , while it decreases for photons that scatter multiple times ( fig  [ fig : nscat ] ) .",
    "however , photons that scatter multiple times traverse a longer path through the wind , which enhances the probability for absorption by dust .",
    "hence , dust can preferentially quench the low polarization photons , which would strengthen our results .",
    "even after reionization , residual neutral hydrogen in the igm can scatter up to @xmath124 of the ly@xmath0 emitted by galaxies out of our line of sight @xcite .",
    "this scattered ly@xmath0 radiation would appear as a faint ly@xmath0 halo surrounding the central ly@xmath0 emitting galaxy @xcite .",
    "we note that back - scattered ly@xmath0 radiation is much less prone to resonant scattering in the igm .",
    "therefore we now consider galaxies that are not surrounded by wind - driven outflows , and examine examples that complement the cases discussed previously .",
    "we adopt the fiducial model described by @xcite to examine the impact of the igm on the observed ly@xmath0 line profile of a @xmath87 galaxy embedded in a dark matter halo with a total mass of @xmath125 .",
    "the halo has a virial radius @xmath126 kpc and a circular velocity @xmath127 km s@xmath25 .",
    "the galaxy is assumed to form stars at a rate of @xmath128 , and the escape fraction of its ionizing photons is taken to be @xmath129 .",
    "the resulting ly@xmath0 luminosity of the galaxy is @xmath130@xmath131 erg s@xmath25 for a gas metallicity of @xmath132 .",
    "gas within the virial radius is assumed to be fully ionized ( @xmath133 ) and no scattering occurs here . just outside the virial radius the igm density , @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the mean baryon density of the universe .",
    "the density decreases as @xmath136 until it approaches @xmath135 . just outside the virial radius",
    ", the igm is assumed to be collapsing at @xmath137 . only at sufficiently large radii ( @xmath138 )",
    "the igm is comoving with the hubble flow ( see barkana 2004 and dijkstra et al 2007b for a more detailed description and a motivation of this model ) photons is lower in a clumpy igm at a fixed value of the ionizing background ( dijkstra et al 2007b ) .",
    "because clumps are not included in the radiative transfer code , we increased the ionizing background ( compared to the clumpy case ) in order to match the observed mean transmission of the igm at a redshift @xmath69 , @xmath139 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we also examine a case where we artificially boost the photoionization rate in the igm .",
    "this boost may represent : ( _ i _ ) an enhanced local ionizing background due to clustering of undetected surrounding sources @xcite ; ( _ ii _ ) an enhanced ionizing background due to the presence of a nearby quasar ; ( _ iii _ ) a galaxy at a lower redshift where the residual neutral hydrogen fraction in the igm is lower ; ( _ iv _ ) an enhanced local photoionization rate due to vigorous star formation in the galaxy itself , or due to an enhanced escape fraction of ionizing photons ; ( _ v _ ) a lower neutral fraction because of a lower overall density of hydrogen nuclei along the line of sight ( e.g. for a galaxy on the edge of a void . )      in the _ top left panel _ of figure  [ fig : igm1 ] we show the spectrum of ly@xmath0 radiation that was transmitted without scattering once ( _ dashed line _ ) , which represents the ly@xmath0 spectrum observed from the galaxy .",
    "this spectrum was the focus of the analysis of e.g santos ( 2004 ) and @xcite .",
    "the plot shows that the blue side of the ly@xmath0 line observed from the galaxy ( @xmath140 ) is eliminated by the igm .",
    "the suppression extends into the red part of the line because of resonant scattering by residual neutral hydrogen gas that is falling onto the galaxy .",
    "therefore , the peak of the observed spectrum is redshifted relative to the true line center by an amount which is set by the gas infall velocity .",
    "the redshift in velocity is @xmath141 .",
    "the spectrum of the resonantly scattered ly@xmath0 halo is shown as the _",
    "solid line_.    the _ top right panel _ of figure  [ fig : igm1 ] shows the surface brightness profile of the scattered ly@xmath0 halo as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the observed surface brightness of the scattered ly@xmath0 photons is @xmath142 erg s@xmath25 @xmath90 arcsec@xmath107 near the center , and decreases with increasing angular separation from the galaxy .",
    "overall , the fractional polarization is small , @xmath143 .",
    "besides the fact that resonantly scattered ly@xmath0 radiation is always less polarized than the radiation in the line wings ( see   [ sec : rt2 ] ) , there is the fact that when the ly@xmath0 enters resonance , it typically scatters multiple times before escaping towards the observer .",
    "this is shown by the _ dotted line _ which gives the mean number of scattering events for the ly@xmath0 photons , @xmath144 , as a function of impact parameter @xmath0 . in this model @xmath145 .",
    "hence , the ly@xmath0 radiation field of resonantly scattered ly@xmath0 photons will locally be close to isotropic , resulting in a low polarization .",
    "the _ lower panels _ in figure  [ fig : igm1 ] show the results for the model in which the ionizing background was boosted .",

    "the _ lower right panels _ show that the surface brightness profile falls slightly faster with a slight peak in the surface brightness profile near the virial radius .",
    "the reason for this peak is that in our model the igm is densest right outside the virial radius , which results in the largest effective optical depth here ( this also produces the dip in the spectrum ) . in this model",
    "each ly@xmath0 photon scatters on average only a few times which causes the scattered ly@xmath0 to be polarized up to @xmath146 .",
    "the mean polarization decreases at @xmath147 .",
    "this is because in our model no scattering occurs inside the virial radius , which extends out to @xmath148 .",
    "therefore , the relative number of photons that was scattered at almost - right - angles decreases at @xmath149 , which in turn decreases the polarization .",
    "for example , scattered photons emerging from @xmath150 were all scattered by @xmath151 and are therefore unpolarized ( @xmath152 ) .",
    "our radiative transfer code does not account for gas clumping in the igm ( in our simulation the gas density is a smooth function of radius @xmath153 ) .",
    "gas clumping affects the predicted polarization : ly@xmath0 photons that resonate with gas inside denser clumps scatter more than calculated in our model , and are therefore polarized at lower levels ( see fig  [ fig : nscat ] ) . on the other hand , photons that resonate with gas in the interclump medium scatter less and",
    "are expected to me more strongly polarized . since this interclump medium has the largest volume filling factor , gas clumping results in net higher level of polarization . the impact of gas clumping on the predicted polarization properties - at a fixed level of the ionizing background - can therefore be mimicked by increasing the level of the ionizing background somewhat .    in summary ,",
    "the polarization of resonantly scattered ly@xmath0 photons in the igm is low compared to the values derived in ",
    "[ sec : wind ] , with the maximum polarization level reaching values of @xmath154 .",
    "the polarization amplitude depends strongly on the local level of the ionizing background .",
    "this is because the polarization decreases with increasing effective optical depth , @xmath155 , which in turn increases with a decreasing local photoionization rate .",
    "@xcite performed monte - carlo calculations of ly@xmath0 radiative transfer through optically thick , spherically symmetric , collapsing gas clouds , which represent simplified models of protogalaxies in the process of their assembly . here",
    "we compute the ly@xmath0 polarization properties for one of the fiducial models presented by @xcite , in which a dark matter halo of mass @xmath156 collapses at @xmath157 while it continuously emits ly@xmath0 over a spatially extended region ( see model * 1.* of dijkstra et al 2006 ) .",
    "the _ left panel _ of figure  [ fig : cool ] shows that the ly@xmath0 emerges with a systematic blueshift , which is due to energy transfer from the gas to the photons , combined with a reduced escape probability for photons in the red wing of the line profile ( see * ? ? ? * for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "right panels _ of figure  [ fig : cool ] show the surface brightness profile ( _ top _ ) , and the fractional polarization @xmath110 ( _ bottom _ ) as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the fractional polarization again reaches values as high as @xmath158 .",
    "this may be surprising given the fact that each photon scatters numerous times before emerging from the cloud .",
    "as mentioned in   [ sec : rt1 ] , ly@xmath0 photons generally escape from an optically thick medium in the line wing , where they acquire larger polarizations than in the line core . furthermore ,",
    "each spherical shell inside the cloud must see a net outward flow of ly@xmath0 photons , or else the cloud would not cool .",
    "this is quantified in figure  [ fig : dir ] which shows the radial dependence of the average value of @xmath159 . here",
    "@xmath52 denotes a photon s propagation direction prior to the last scattering event ( as in fig  [ fig : scheme ] ) , and @xmath160 denotes a unit - vector that is pointing radially outward from the center of the cloud . in this convention @xmath161 ( @xmath162 ) for a photon that is moving radially outward ( inward ) . for an isotropic radiation field @xmath163",
    "clearly , @xmath164 is positive at all radii , and increases with radius . in other words , photons that are scattered towards",
    "the observer were preferentially moving radially outward prior to the scattering event .",
    "furthermore , this anisotropy in the radiation field radiation field that is seen by each atom in the cloud is dominated by photons that are resonantly scattering , and is almost completely isotropic . however , these photons have a negligible probability of escaping towards the observer and do not affect the observable ly@xmath0 polarization properties of the cloud .",
    "] increases with radius , which results in an increasingly large fractional polarization with impact parameter ( fig  [ fig : cool ] ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : impactcool ] we show the frequency dependence of the polarization at 3 different angular separations : @xmath165 , @xmath166 , and @xmath167 arcseconds .",
    "the _ thick solid line _ is the spectrum shown previously in figure  [ fig : cool ] , indicating that the bulk of the photons emerge with frequencies @xmath168 . within this frequency range",
    ", the polarization increases towards the blue .",
    "the reason for this wavelength dependent polarization is that ly@xmath0 photons that are far in the blue wing of the line profile , appear even farther in the wing in the frame of the infalling gas . therefore , the escape probability of ly@xmath0 photons increases , and the radiation field becomes increasingly anisotropic towards higher photon frequencies .",
    "this in turn increases the polarization towards higher frequencies .",
    "lastly , it should be pointed out that the frequency dependence of the polarization applies mostly to the case @xmath169 arcseconds , and similarly to the case @xmath170 that was shown in figure  [ fig : impact ] .",
    "hence , the frequency dependence of the polarization is evident only where the overall ( frequency averaged ) polarization is significant ( @xmath171 ) .",
    "the ly@xmath0 emission needs to be spatially resolved in order for its polarization to be measured . over the past decade , a large number of spatially extended ly@xmath0 emitters , also known as ly@xmath0 blobs , were discovered @xcite .",
    "in fact , the size distribution of ly@xmath0 sources is continuous and ly@xmath0 blobs simply represent the largest and rarest objects in this distribution @xcite .",
    "this implies that there is no shortage of spatially extended ly@xmath0 sources in the universe .    as was shown in ",
    "[ sec : result ] , the polarization properties of spatially resolved ly@xmath0 emission encode information about the medium through which the ly@xmath0 photons propagate , especially in combination with spectral information ( fig  [ fig : impact ] and fig  [ fig : impactcool ] ) .",
    "for example , large fractional polarizations ( tens of percent ) are expected for rayleigh scattering .",
    "an increase in the polarization towards longer wavelengths would be indicative of backscattering off an expanding outflow .",
    "such an inference could be particularly important because ( _ i _ ) it provides evidence that the extended ly@xmath0 emission results from scattering ( _ ii _ ) it allows to better gauge the impact of resonant scattering in the igm on the observed ly@xmath0 line profile , since back - scattered ly@xmath0 radiation is much less prone to resonant scattering in the igm .",
    "understanding the impact of resonant scattering on the ly@xmath0 line profiles is essential for ( _ iia _ ) deriving constraints on the ionization state of the igm @xcite , and ( _ iib _ ) interpreting ly@xmath0 emitters with large equivalent widths @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we have shown numerical examples for the polarization properties of ly@xmath0 radiation that is either _ ( i ) _ resonantly scattered in the igm ; _ ( ii ) _ backscattered in an outflow ; or _ ( iii ) _ associated with cooling radiation from a collapsing protogalaxy .",
    "there are other classes of spatially extended ly@xmath0 sources that have not been discussed :    * gas in close proximity to a bright source of ionizing radiation ( e.g. a quasar ) may glow in fluorescent ly@xmath0 emission @xcite . if the recombining ly@xmath0",
    "emitting gas is sufficiently close to the quasar or the quasar is particularly bright , then this gas is optically thin to ly@xmath0 photons and the emergent ly@xmath0 radiation is not expected to be polarized .",
    "however , fluorescent ly@xmath0 emission is also expected from lyman limit systems and damped ly@xmath0 systems @xcite , which are optically thick to ly@xmath0 . especially in cases",
    "where the gas is illuminated anisotropically , scattering could lead to a detectable polarization .",
    "* spatially extended ly@xmath0 emission may be generated by gas that was shock heated by a superwind - driven outflow ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "little is known about the source of the ly@xmath0 emission and to what degree the ly@xmath0 is scattered by residual neutral gas .",
    "polarimetry may provide new insights on the nature of these sources .",
    "we have focused on spatially extended ly@xmath0 sources , as the polarization averages out to zero for a symmetric unresolved source . however , as was shown by @xcite , anisotropic outflows ( e.g biconical outflows ) may still result in observable polarization , even if the ly@xmath0 source is completely unresolved .",
    "hence , a measurable polarization may not be restricted to spatially resolved ly@xmath0 sources .",
    "lastly , we point out that accurate polarization measurements of faint high - redshift sources is difficult",
    ". it would therefore be prudent to obtain polarimetry of the brightest sources first .",
    "polarization measurements of one of the brightest known ly@xmath0 blobs ( at @xmath172 , dey et al .",
    "2005 ) have already been attempted ( prescott et al . 2008 ) .",
    "this approach will likely lead to insights about the processes that regulate the transfer of ly@xmath0 in and around high - redshift galaxies .",
    "the dominant foregrounds in the infrared sky ( at wavelengths @xmath173 m ) , are rayleigh scattered moonlight and starlight ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and are therefore polarized .",
    "however , line emitters can easily be extracted from this scattered foreground for which the spectrum is continuous . here",
    ", we investigate whether ly@xmath0 emitters can be distinguished from _ foreground line emitters _ , such as [ oii ] , [ oiii ] , h@xmath0 , and h@xmath6 emitters , based on their polarization properties .",
    "in practice it has been possible to effectively discriminate between these low - redshift interlopers and actual high - redshift ly@xmath0 emitters based on broad - band colors and on the shape of the ly@xmath0 line ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the continuum spectrum of some ly@xmath0 emitters with a large equivalent width is difficult to detect , and in some cases the ly@xmath0 line is not asymmetric ( see e.g the _ lower left panel _ of fig  [ fig : igm1 ] )",
    ".    the possibility that high - redshift ly@xmath0 emitters are highly polarized may provide another diagnostic that distinguishes them from low - redshift interlopers . a low level of polarization ( @xmath174 ) is expected for any extragalactic line emitter due to scattering by dust in the milky - way @xcite .",
    "furthermore , spatially resolved [ oiii ] line emission at higher levels of polarization ( @xmath175 ) has been observed in a small fraction of seyfert 2 galaxies @xcite .",
    "this polarization arises when the narrow line region is obscured . in this case , the only [ oiii ] photons that are observed are scattered towards the observer , either by dust or by electrons .",
    "this same mechanism could produce polarized [ oii ] , h@xmath0 and h@xmath6 line emission .",
    "this suggests it is risky to distinguish high - redshift ly@xmath0 emitters from low - redshift interlopers on the basis of polarimetry . on the other hand , the observed levels of polarization in low - redshift interlopers",
    "are small compared to the values we find in our models , which suggests that high levels of polarization ( @xmath176 ) are indicative of scattered ly@xmath0 .",

    "* their fig  4 - 8 ) ; these features clearly distinguish them from ly@xmath0 line emitters .",
    "ground - based searches for high - redshift ly@xmath0 emitters are complicated by the presence of bright oh emission lines , which are produced by the excited radical oh@xmath180 in the ionosphere , following the reaction h+o@xmath181 oh@xmath182+o@xmath183 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the high - redshift universe is known to contain luminous ly@xmath0 emitting sources such as galaxies and quasars .",
    "the ly@xmath0 photons that are emitted by these sources are typically scattered both in the interstellar medium and in the intergalactic medium . in this paper",
    "we have calculated polarization properties of this scattered ly@xmath0 radiation .",

    "we differentiated between resonant and wing scattering , as these are described by different scattering matrices ( see appendix  [ app : super ] ) .",
    "wing scattering is described by classical rayleigh scattering and in this case we advanced the photon s polarization vector in a scattering event following the well - tested approach of rybicki & loeb ( 1999 ) .",
    "however , resonant scattering is described by a superposition of rayleigh scattering and isotropic scattering with corresponding weights of @xmath42 and @xmath43 (   [ sec : rt2 ] ) . in this case , minor modifications to the approach of @xcite are required when advancing the photon s polarization vector (   [ sec : rt3 ] ) .",
    "we have applied our code to three classes of models which represent the diverse sets of environments around high - redshift galaxies :    * first , we computed the polarization of the back - scattered ly@xmath0 radiation observed from galaxies surrounded by a superwind - driven outflow .",
    "we have found that the fractional polarization may reach values as high as @xmath191 , where the maximum polarization depends on parameters such as the speed of the outflow , @xmath192 , and the column density of neutral hydrogen atoms , @xmath17 (   [ sec : wind ] ) . in this case",
    "we have found the polarization to increase towards longer wavelengths . *",
    "second , we considered resonant scattering in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) _",

    "( [ eq : phasecore ] ) reveals that ly@xmath0 resonant scattering of unpolarized light corresponds to the case @xmath206 and @xmath207 .    as was mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : rt2 ] , the non - zero degree of polarization arises fully level does not result in any polarization is that the angular part of the wavefunction describing the electron in the @xmath208-state is a constant ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "hence an atom that is excited into the @xmath208-state has lost any memory of the direction and/or polarization of the photon that excited the atom .",

    "hence , scattering by 90@xmath213 via the h - transition results in @xmath214 , as was already mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : rt2 ] .",
    "because scattering is twice as likely to occur via the h transition , the scattering averaged value becomes @xmath215 .",
    "lastly , we point out that rayleigh and isotropic scattering by @xmath216 results in @xmath217 and @xmath218 polarization , respectively .",
    "since resonant scattering may be viewed as a superposition of rayleigh scattering and isotropic scattering with corresponding weights of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , one might expect @xmath216 resonant scattering to result in a fractional polarization of @xmath219 , while the actual number is @xmath220 .",
    "the main reason for this difference is that isotropic and rayleigh scattering have different phase functions , and that _ if _ scattering by @xmath216 occurs , then the probability that this was due to isotropic scattering is larger than @xmath221 .",
    "quantitatively , the angular dependence of the fractional contribution of rayleigh scattering to the phase - function is given by @xmath222 , which was used in ",
    "[ sec : rt3 ] .      in   [ sec : rt2 ] the phase function and the degree of polarization caused by resonant and wing scattering were given . here",
    "we discuss the transition between these two regimes .",
    "@xcite has calculated the value of @xmath197 as a function of frequency ( but note that @xmath223 in the notation of stenflo 1980 , eq .",
    "we have plotted @xmath197 as a function of wavelength ( bottom label ) and frequency ( top label ) in figure  [ fig : app ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : app ] shows that @xmath224 at the h resonance frequency and @xmath225 at the k resonance frequency , which correspond exactly to the values quoted above .",
    "the figure also shows that at sufficiently large separations from both resonances , @xmath226 . in dimensionless frequency units ,",
    "this asymptotic value is practically reached when @xmath227 .",
    "this was the motivation for using the threshold @xmath49 to separate core from wing scattering in ",
    "[ sec : rt3 ] .",
    "interestingly , @xmath228 for a range of frequencies between the h and k resonance frequencies .",
    "however , scattering at these frequencies does not occur often enough to leave an observable imprint .",
    "the reason for this is simple : the natural width of the line for both the h and k transitions is much smaller than their separation , i.e @xmath229 hz @xmath230 hz . since the absorption cross  section in the atom s rest - frame scales as , @xmath231^{-1}$ ] , a ly@xmath0 photon is much more likely absorbed by an atom for which the photon appears exactly at resonance , than by an atom for which the photon has an energy corresponding to a negative @xmath232 .",
    "quantitatively , the maxwellian probability @xmath233 that a photon of frequency @xmath20 is scattered at frequency @xmath234 in the atom s rest - frame is given by @xmath235 where @xmath236 is the voigt function ( @xmath237 , see eq  [ eq : phi ] ) .",

    "@xmath238 ( _ solid line _ ) and @xmath239 ( _ dashed line _ ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : app2 ] shows that for @xmath238 , photons are scattered either when they are exactly at resonance or when they appear @xmath240 doppler widths away from resonance .",
    "the inset of figure  [ fig : app2 ] zooms on the region near @xmath241 .",
    "clearly , if a photon is resonantly scattered , then it is more likely to be scattered when it is _ exactly _ at resonance then when it is , say , @xmath242 doppler widths away from resonance . for frequencies @xmath243 there are not enough atoms moving at velocities such that the ly@xmath0 photon appears at resonance in the frame of the atom . instead",
    ", the photon is scattered while it is in the wing of the absorption profile .",
    "this is illustrated by the _ dashed line _ which shows the case @xmath239 , for which resonant scattering is less likely by orders of magnitude .    from the above we",
    "conclude that ( _ i _ ) when a photon is scattered in the wing of the line profile , then @xmath244 and ( _ ii _ ) when a photon is scattered resonantly , then it is scattered almost exactly at resonance , and therefore @xmath206 ( the scattering - averaged value ) .      in this section",
    "we show that the procedure for propagating the wave and polarizations vector in a single rayleigh scattering event that was outlined in   [ sec : rt3 ] , naturally accounts for the polarization dependence of @xmath31 and @xmath33 .",
    "we introduce a rectangular coordinate system in which a ly@xmath0 photon propagates along the @xmath245axis prior to scattering , and in the @xmath246 plane after scattering ( see fig  [ fig : app3 ] ) . in this coordinate system , @xmath247 , @xmath248 , and @xmath249 , where the notation of ",

    "the components of the intensity parallel and perpendicular to the plane of scattering -prior to scattering- are given by @xmath251 and @xmath252 , respectively .",
    "from the scattering matrix it follows that the phase function for this polarized radiation is given by @xmath253 using that @xmath254 we obtain      hence , the probability that a photon is emitted into solid angle @xmath256 scales simply as @xmath257 ( where @xmath258 ) .",
    "this phase - function was used in this paper for rayleigh scattering ( @xmath259 ) .",
    "hence , this method naturally incorporates the polarization dependence of scattering phase function .",
    "furthermore , the intensity parallel and perpendicular to the plane of scattering after scattering are given by @xmath260 and @xmath261 , respectively .",
