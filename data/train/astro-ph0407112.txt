    "grb030329/sn2003dh @xcite and grb980425/sn1998bw @xcite show that type ib / c supernovae are the parent population of long grbs .",
    "type ib / c sne are believed to represent core - collapse events of massive stars in compact binaries @xcite .",
    "they are probably part of a continuous sequence adjacent to type ii sne , ordered by increasing compactness of the binary in which the hydrogen ( ib / c ) and the helium ( ic ) envelope are removed in a common envelope phase @xcite .",
    "the remaining naked star rotates rapidly at the orbital period by tidal spin - up . as the inactive iron - core succumbs to its own weight and that of the surrounding he - envelope , a rotating black hole nucleates during core - collapse @xcite .",
    "some of the binding energy liberated during gravitational collapse will be channeled to eject matter , producing an accompanying hydrogen ( and helium ) deficient type ib ( type ic ) supernova @xcite .",
    "the branching ratio of type ib / c sne to grb - sne can be calculated from the ratio @xmath2 of observed grbs - to - type ii supernovae @xcite , a beaming factor of 450 @xcite to 500 @xcite and a rate of about 0.2 of type ib / c - to - type ii supernovae @xcite , giving @xmath3=\\frac{n(\\mbox{grb - sne})}{n(\\mbox{type~ib / c } ) } \\simeq ( 2 - 4)\\times 10^{-3}. \\label{branch}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this ratio is remarkably small , suggesting a higher - order down - selection process .",
    "the small branching ratio ( [ branch ] ) can be attributed to various factors in the process of creating grbs in type ib / c supernovae @xcite , e.g , not all baryon poor jets successfully punch through the remnant stellar envelope @xcite , and not all massive progenitors making type ib / c supernovae nucleate rapidly rotating black holes .",
    "it is unlikely that either one of these down - selection processes by itself accounts for the smallness of @xmath1 .",
    "rather , a combination of these might effectively contribute to a small branching ratio .    by tidal interaction with the companion star ,",
    "the naked star is not spherical prior to collapse .",
    "black holes nucleated in nonspherical collapse possess recoil by bekenstein s gravitational radiation recoil mechanism @xcite .",
    "tidal deformation produces a systematic recoil velocity , which may combine with random multipole mass - moments to produce a distribution in recoil velocities . some of the black holes will leave the central high - density core prematurely , before completion of the stellar collapse process .",
    "these events are _ decentered_. other holes will remain centered and surge into a high - mass object surrounded by a high - density accretion disk or torus .",
    "these events are _",
    "centered black holes becomes luminous in a state of suspended accretion , if they rotate rapidly .",
    "they spin down against emissions in gravitational radiation and other radiation channels @xcite .",
    "the latter includes a burst in high - energy radiation from torus winds which radiatively drives a supernova @xcite , closely related to @xcite .    here",
    ", we quantify the various stages in the nucleation of black holes in stellar collapse .",
    "we favor an association with binaries @xcite based on the type ii / ib event sn1993j @xcite and the proposed association of grb - supernovae remnants with soft x - ray transients @xcite .",
    "we shall identify a branching ratio of core - collapse events producing centered nucleation of black holes with the probability of low kick velocities based on the bekenstein recoil mechanism .    a related but different mechanism for explaining the small branching ratio based on kick velocities in core - collapse",
    "poses fragmentation into two or more objects @xcite . in this scenario , grbs are associated with the formation of a fireball in the merger of binaries possessing small kick velocities .",
    "it is motivated , in part , in the search for delay mechanisms in creating a grb , after the onset of the supernova on the basis of x - ray line - emissions in grb011211 . however",
    ", x - ray line - emissions produced in radiatively powered supernovae allow the same time - of - onset of the grb and the supernova , obviating the need for any delay mechanism @xcite .",
    "rotating black holes are described by kerr @xcite . in core - collapse of massive stars , rotating black holes nucleate by accumulation of mass and angular momentum from infalling matter .",
    "the kerr solution describes the constraint @xmath4 for a black hole of mass @xmath5 and angular momentum @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is newton s constant and @xmath8 is the velocity of light .",
    "table i summarizes the key quantities of kerr black holes .",
    "quite generally , initial collapse of a rotating core produces a torus @xcite , which initially satisfies @xmath9 thus , the nucleation of black holes takes place through a _ first - order _ phase - transition : a torus forms of increasing mass by accumulation of matter , diluting its angular momentum until it satisfies ( [ eqn_jm ] ) and collapses into an extremal black hole .",
    "the alternative of a second - order phase transition which initially forms a sub - solar mass black hole , requires rapid shedding of excess angular momentum by gravitational radiation .",
    "however , limited mass - densities in core - collapse probably render this mechanism ineffective in competition with mixing on the free - fall timescale of the core . nevertheless , gravitational radiation emitted from a non - axisymmetric torus prior to the nucleation of the black hole is potentially interesting @xcite .",
    "gravitational radiation in the formation of black holes through a first - order phase transition is important in non - spherical collapse , even when its energy emissions are small relative to the initial mass of the black hole .",
    "the bekenstein gravitational radiation - recoil mechanism operates already in the presence of initial asphericities of about @xmath10 , producing a recoil of 300km / s or less .",
    "the radius of the accretion disk or torus around a newly formed stellar mass black hole is @xmath11 cm .",
    "a torus of a few tenths of a solar mass forms by accumulation of matter spiralling in , compressed by a factor @xmath12 as it stalls against the angular momentum barrier outside the inner most stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "the time - of - collapse of stellar matter from a radius @xmath13 is about the free - fall timescale , @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the mass of the progenitor he - star .",
    "the newly formed low - mass black hole is typically kicked out of the central high - density region into surrounding lower - density regions _ before _ core - collapse is completed .",
    "it continues to grow off - center by accretion of relatively low - density matter  a high - density accretion disk never forms . with low but non - zero probability , the black hole has small",
    "recoil , remains centered and surges into a high mass black hole surrounded by a high - density torus .",
    "after nucleation of the black hole , an accretion disk may form provided that the specific angular momentum @xmath16 of infalling matter exceeds that of the inner most stable circular orbit ( isco ) , @xmath17 on the angular momentum @xmath6 of a black hole of mass @xmath5 . here",
    ", @xmath18 denotes the dimensionless specific angular momentum of matter in circular orbits on the isco , where @xmath19 denotes the specific angular momentum of the black hole .",

    "the evolution of the newly nucleated black hole continues to be governed by angular momentum loss of the surrounding matter , until the inequality in ( [ eqn_jl ] ) is reversed .",
    "the black hole rapidly grows uninhibited , while the inequality ( [ eqn_jl ] ) is reversed ( @xmath27 . this _ surge _ continues until once again ( [ eqn_jl ] ) holds . in dimensionless form , ( [ eqn_jl ] ) becomes @xmath28 where @xmath29 in terms of the dimensionless integrals @xmath30 and @xmath31 of the normalized lane - emden density distribution with @xmath32 at the origin and the zero @xmath33 at @xmath34 . here , @xmath35 in cylindrical geometry",
    "for which @xmath36 , and @xmath37 in spherical geometry for which @xmath38 ; @xmath39 denotes the binary period in days , @xmath40 denotes the radius in units of the solar radius @xmath41 cm @xcite , and @xmath15 the mass of the progenitor he - star .",
    "1 shows the solutions as a function of dimensionless period @xmath42 .",
    "the upper branch shows that rapidly spinning black holes plus accretion disk form in small - period binaries @xcite , following a surge for periods beyond the bifurcation points @xmath43 @xmath44 the resulting mass and energy fractions as a function of @xmath42 are shown in fig .",
    "these two geometries serve to bound the range of values in more detailed calculations , e.g. , through multi - dimensional numerical simulations .    _ the bardeen trajectory _ corresponds to continuing accretion beyond surge , wherein matter remaining in the remnant envelope forms an accretion disk outside the isco . at this point ,",
    "magnetohydrodynamical stresses within the disk as well as disk winds may drive continuing accretion .",
    "accretion from the isco onto the black hole further increases the black hole mass and spin according to @xmath45 @xcite , generally causing spin - up towards an extremal state of the black hole . in fig . 1",
    "this is indicated by accretion _",
    "upwards _ beyond the upper isco - branch .",
    "_ radiative spin - down _ corresponds to a long - duration burst of gravitational radiation emitted by a non - axisymmetric torus @xcite , described by a frequency and energy @xmath46 where @xmath47 , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 denote the relative mass and angular velocity of the torus .",
    "this takes place if the torus is uniformly magnetized with the remnant magnetic field of the progenitor star . in fig .",
    "1 , this radiative spin - down is indicated by a transition _ downwards _ from the upper isco branch to the branch on which the angular velocities of the black hole and of matter at the isco match ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) .",
    "this radiative transition lasts for the lifetime of rapid spin of the black hole  a dissipative timescale of tens of seconds @xcite .",
    "additional matter accreted is either blown off the torus in its winds , or accumulates and accretes onto the black hole after spin - down .",
    "in what follows , we shall consider a two - dimensional gaussian distribution of kick velocities in the equatorial plane associated with the the tidal deformation of the progenitor star by its companion , assuming a velocity dispersion @xmath52km / s in bekenstein s recoil mechanism .",
    "the probability of centered nucleation during @xmath53 s is that of a kick velocity @xmath5410km / s , i.e. : @xmath55 while the numerical value has some uncertainties , the selection mechanism by gravitational radiation - recoil effectively creates a small probability of centered nucleation .",
    "we identify the branching ratio of type ib / c sne into grbs with the probability of centered nucleation , @xmath3=p_{c}\\simeq 0.5\\%,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] effectively creating a small , higher - order branching ratio .",
    "the proposed centered and decentered core - collapse events predicts a differentiation in gravitational wave - signatures .",
    "these signatures are of interest to the newly commissioned gravitational wave - detectors ligo , virgo and tama , both as burst sources and through their collective contributions to the stochastic background in gravitational radiation @xcite .",
    "the black hole nucleation process is accompanied by a short burst in gravitational radiation , specifically in response to non - axisymmetric toroidal structures and fragmentation @xcite .",
    "its gravitational radiation signature depends on details of the hydrodynamical collapse .",
    "centered nucleation is followed by a long burst in gravitational radiation .",
    "a short burst in gravitational radiation is hereby common to all type ib / c supernovae .",
    "this may apply to type ii events as well .",
    "type ii events are possibly associated with low spin - rates and could represent delayed core - collapse via an intermediate  nucleon \" star ( sn1987a , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "their gravitational wave - emissions are thereby essentially limited to that produced by kick ( if any ) and collapse of this nucleon star . for a recent review of the short - duration ( @xmath56s ) bursts of gravitational waves in core - bounce , more closely related to type ii supernovae ,",
    "see @xcite and references therein .    on account of ( [ eqn_aa1]-[eqn_aa2 ] ) ,",
    "core - collapse compact can produce high - mass , rapidly spinning black holes in centered nucleation , whose rotational energy can reach about one - half the maximal spin - energy of a kerr black hole . in a suspended accretion state , these black holes spin - down in the process of emitting a long - duration burst of tens of seconds in gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "this long duration burst comes as a second burst , after the short burst of gravitational radiation in centered nucleation .",
    "to conclude , type ib / c supernovae produce a short , single burst of gravitational radiation at birth of a low - mass black hole .",
    "the sub - population of grb - supernovae produce a subsequent long burst of gravitational radiation representing spin - down of the black hole .",
    "the second burst takes place after a quiescent or subluminous @xcite surge of the black hole into a high - mass object .",
