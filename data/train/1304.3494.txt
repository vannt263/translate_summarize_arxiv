    "quark masses are free parameters of the qcd lagrangian that parametrize explicit breaking of the chiral symmetry . for quarks heavier than 1 gev ,",
    "quark masses arise as independent hard scales @xmath3 in perturbative qcd calculations for particle cross sections .",
    "quarks are not observed freely because of color confinement , hence their properties and masses are established indirectly by comparing theory calculations against experimental data on hadronic reactions . in a global analysis of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the proton , the method by which the heavy - quark masses are included in experiments at energies comparable to @xmath3 has non - negligible impact on the extracted pdfs @xcite .",
    "variations in the pdfs associated with the treatment of heavy quarks have phenomenological consequences for electroweak precision measurements at the large hadron collider @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we explore constraints on the charm quark mass from the global hadronic data in the cteq nnlo pdf analysis .",
    "the study is motivated by publications of combined cross sections on inclusive deep - inclusive scattering ( dis ) and semi - inclusive dis charm production at the @xmath4 collider hera @xcite . among all experimental data sets included in the global fit ,",
    "the dis experiments have the best potential to constrain the charm mass . on the theory side , pqcd calculations for neutral - current deep inelastic scattering have been extended to the 2-loop level in the qcd coupling strength @xmath5 both for massless @xcite and massive @xcite quarks , while massless @xcite and some massive @xcite coefficient functions were also obtained at the 3-loop level . with such accuracy ,",
    "it becomes possible to determine the charm quark mass and its uncertainty from the dis data .",
    "the current world average of the charm mass in the @xmath6 renormalization scheme is @xmath7 gev  @xcite .",
    "this value is derived primarily from measurements in timelike scattering processes and lattice simulations , using analyses that include up to four orders in perturbative qcd .",
    "the precise dis data from hera in principle allows us to extract @xmath8 from a spacelike scattering process and compare to other determinations .",
    "in many previous pdf analyses , the heavy - quark masses have been treated as effective parameters rather than fundamental constants .",
    "they were anticipated to deviate from the @xmath0 masses or even be fully independent . besides entering the exact matrix elements , the heavy - quark masses control various approximations in dis calculations , as will be reviewed below .",
    "the approximations affect extraction of the mass values from the hadronic data , but their effect is of a higher order in the qcd coupling strength according to the qcd factorization theorem .",
    "thus , although the bias due to the approximations can be important at low orders , it is expected to subside as more loops are included in pqcd calculations . at high enough order of @xmath9 , such as the nnlo ,",
    "a comparison to the world - average @xmath0 quark mass becomes feasible .",
    "there exist several theoretical approaches , or heavy - quark schemes , for computations involving massive quarks @xcite .",
    "the extracted @xmath2 value depends on the heavy - quark scheme as well as the order of the pqcd calculation . in this work",
    ", we adopt a two - loop implementation @xcite of the general - mass scheme s - acot-@xmath1 @xcite employed in the ct10 nnlo analysis @xcite .",
    "we discuss physics assumptions affecting the extracted value of @xmath10 and comparisons to other recent extractions of @xmath2 @xcite . within this scheme ,",
    "we find the range of input @xmath8 values providing the best description of the ct10 fitted data and compare it to the world - average value .",
    "finally , we analyze the impact of the uncertainty in the charm mass on benchmark lhc predictions .",
    "quantum field theory operates with two common definitions of the quark mass , the pole mass and the @xmath6 mass .",
    "the pole mass is defined as the position of the pole in the renormalized quark propagator .",
    "the pole mass is infrared - safe , gauge - invariant , and is derived in the on - shell renormalization scheme .",
    "it is often close to the experimental mass definition @xcite , but , as the pole charm mass value of 1.3 - 1.8 gev borders the nonperturbative region , accuracy of its determination is limited by significant radiative contributions associated with renormalons @xcite . because of large perturbative coefficients arising even at three or four loops in the qcd coupling @xmath5",
    ", the pole @xmath2 value can not be determined to better than a few hundred mev .",
    "the @xmath6 mass @xmath11 , on the other hand , is the renormalized quark mass in the modified - minimal - subtraction scheme , defined as a short - distance mass that is not affected by nonperturbative ambiguities .",
    "it is evaluated at a momentum scale @xmath12 typical for the hard process , frequently taken to be the mass @xmath2 itself .",
    "precise determinations of @xmath8 achieve a smaller uncertainty of order 30 mev or less .",
    "the @xmath6 mass starts to differ from the pole mass beginning at order @xmath13 .",
    "the conversion between the @xmath6 mass to the pole mass is required in the pdf analysis , as the massive 2-loop wilson coefficients and operator matrix elements in dis are available in terms of the pole mass .",
    "the conversion procedure will be reviewed in the next section .    in parton - level diagrams for deep - inelastic scattering ,",
    "external massive quarks may arise both as the final and initial states .",
    "for the quarks that are heavier than the proton , some factorization schemes introduce an effective pdf to describe their quasi - collinear production at high energy .",
    "the heavy - quark pdf can contribute to the hadronic cross section through a convolution with a hard - scattering matrix element with the heavy quark(s ) in the initial state , also called a `` flavor - excitation '' matrix element .",
    "in contrast , the `` flavor - creation '' matrix elements include only light quarks and gluons in the initial state , while the heavy quarks are only in the final state .",
    "the `` flavor - excitation '' contributions commonly arise in the variable flavor number ( vfn ) schemes , such as the general - mass vfn ( gm vfn ) scheme .",
    "the alternative fixed - flavor number ( ffn ) scheme does not introduce a heavy - quark pdf operates with `` flavor - creation '' terms only .    for this study",
    "we employ the s - acot-@xmath1 general - mass scheme @xcite implemented to the 2-loop ( nnlo ) accuracy @xcite .",
    "this scheme includes exact massive flavor - creation contributions that dominate at low boson virtualities @xmath14 , as well as the approximate flavor - excitation terms that are important at high @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the s - acot-@xmath1 scheme reduces to the ffn scheme at @xmath15 and to the zero - mass vfn scheme at @xmath16 .    in a comprehensive factorization scheme such as gm - vfn ,",
    "the charm mass plays several roles .",
    "first , the _ exact _ charm mass enters feynman diagrams for charm particle creation in the final state , such as @xmath17 in nc dis .",
    "second , auxiliary scales are introduced that are of order of the fundamental charm mass ( either the pole mass or @xmath0 mass ) , but need not to coincide with it .",
    "one such scale sets the energy for switching from the 3-flavor to 4-flavor evolution in the running @xmath18 , which is utilized by both ffn and vfn computations .",
    "a similar switching scale from 3-flavor evolution to 4-flavor evolution arises in the pdfs @xmath19 .",
    "the charm mass also defines characteristic energy scales in the flavor - excitation contributions , cf .",
    "[ sec : details - of - implementation ] .",
    "finally , there can be auxiliary scales associated with the final - state quark fragmentation into hadrons , present both in the ffn and gm - vfn schemes .",
    "the dependence on these auxiliary scales is reduced with each successive order of perturbation theory .    when the input mass is varied in the global fit ,",
    "the response of the dis cross sections reflects coordinated variations of all such scales .",
    "an important question arises when interpreting the outcome of the fit : which mass parameter controls the agreement with the data , the exact charm mass or the approximate mass in the auxiliary scales ?",
    "we have found that the global fit is sensitive to the exact charm mass , despite the introduced approximations . in one exercise",
    ", we have varied the input charm mass in the exact dis coefficient functions for flavor - creation processes , while keeping it fixed in the above auxiliary mass scales . in a complementary exercise , we varied the input mass in all auxiliary scales , while keeping it fixed in the exact flavor - creation coefficient functions . in both cases , we examined the agreement with the data as a function of the varied mass parameter .",
    "we followed the fitting procedure outlined in the next section and assumed fixed pdf parametrizations for the best - fit @xmath10 found in the main analysis .",
    "the dependence of the figure - of - merit function @xmath20 on the varied @xmath8 in these exercises is shown for all fitted experiments , the combined hera inclusive dis data @xcite , and the combined hera semi - inclusive charm production data @xcite in the upper left , upper right , and lower panels of fig .",
