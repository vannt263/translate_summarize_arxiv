    "it is therefore of interest to quantify the entanglement produced by quantum algorithms and examine its correlation with their efficiency .",
    "this requires to develop entanglement measures for the quantum states of multiple qubits that appear in quantum algorithms .",

    "the special case of bi - partite entanglement has been studied extensively in recent years and suitable entanglement measures were introduced .",
    "it was established that bi - partite entanglement can be considered as a resource for teleportation @xcite .",
    "the entanglement of bi - partite pure states can be evaluated by the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix , traced over one of the parties .",
    "for bi - partite mixed states , several measures were proposed @xcite and for the special case of states of two qubits an exact formula for the entanglement of formation was obtained @xcite . for mixed states of multiple qubits , entanglement measures based on distance measures in hilbert space were proposed @xcite .",

    "that the given state @xmath2 is a pure state , @xmath18 coincides with the groverian measure for pure states , introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it might seem surprising that in order to evaluate the entanglement of an @xmath0-qubit system one needs a search space of @xmath1 qubits .",
    "this can be explained by considering mixed states as open systems , where , in some cases , the mixture represents an effective entanglement with external qubits .",
    "purification of the mixed state @xmath2 to @xmath1 qubits enables us to create a closed system with no entanglement to any external qubits , in which all the relevant information is maintained .",
    "the groverian measure for mixed states enables to fully capture the entanglement in @xmath2 .",
    "mathematically , this measure satisfies the conditions required from an entanglement measure .",

    "quantum algorithms are designed to start with a well defined initial state .",
    "the final state , just before the measurement is taken , can be either a basis state or a superposition of basis states .",
    "for example , in grover s algorithm with a single marked state , the desired final state ( namely the marked state ) is a basis state . in grover s algorithm with several marked states , as well as in shor s factoring algorithm ,",
    "the desired final state is a superposition .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper can be generalized by replacing grover s algorithm by some other quantum algorithm .",
    "if in the replacement algorithm the desired final state is a basis state , @xmath18 will not depend on the specific algorithm .",
    "however , for algorithms such as shor s algorithm , the maximal success probability may not coincide with the expression used in the groverian measure . yet , in the special case of grover s algorithm with several marked states , the groverian measure still holds @xcite .",
    "recently , the groverian measure was applied in order to evaluate the entanglement in certain pure quantum states of multiple qubits @xcite .",
    "a convenient parametrization was developed that enables analytical calculations of @xmath14 for some pure states of high symmetry . in order to evaluate it for arbitrary states ,",
    "a numerical minimization procedure , based on the steepest descent algorithm was developed . using this procedure ,",
    "the entanglement of intermediate states , generated during the evolution of grover s algorithm , was calculated .",
    "it was found that even if the initial state and the target state are product states , in intermediate stages of the algorithm , highly entangled states are generated , in agreement with earlier studies in which other measures were used @xcite .",
    "this result is interesting in the context of attempts to examine the role of entanglement in quantum algorithms and specifically in grover s search algorithm . in particular",
    ", recent studies have shown that an implementation of grover s algorithm using classical media , namely , in which quantum entanglement does not play a role , would require an exponentially larger overhead compared to the quantum case @xcite .",
    "unlike the case of pure states of two qubits , in which the von neumann entropy provides a complete characterization of the entanglement , multiple qubit states support a large number of different measures @xcite .",
    "it seems that the issue of what measure is relevant depends on the specific physical or operational context in which it is used . in particular , the groverian entanglement measure is motivated by a quantum algorithm .",
    "it thus appears to be a suitable measure for the evaluation of the entanglement that is produced during the evolution of quantum algorithms .",
    "the actual evaluation of entanglement measures turns out to be a difficult computational problem .",
    "this is due to the fact that these measures are typically defined as an extremum of some multi - variable function .",
