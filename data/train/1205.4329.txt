    "a theory of the pseudogap phase in high temperature superconducting cuprates , proposed by varma@xcite , introduced intra - unit cell orbital currents within cuo@xmath0 planes as a key feature characterizing the physical properties of this phase .",
    "varma s theory is based on a mean - field solution of a three band hubbard model , and predicted two possible orbital current patterns , with their resulting orbital moments pointing out of the plane .",
    "photoemission dichroism @xcite and neutron scattering experiments @xcite are consistent with one of these patterns , depicted in fig .  [ twoloopa ]",
    ". this current pattern can be characterized by an in - plane vector order parameter , the toroidal moment ( or anapole ) @xcite .",
    "this vector , odd under inversion and time - reversal , has the same symmetry properties as the magnetoelectric susceptibility , which it is usually @xcite identified with .",
    "for the cuo@xmath0 case , the anapole has two possible in - plane orientations @xcite , forming an e@xmath1 representation .",
    "but the neutron experiments @xcite in addition show that the observed magnetic moments have an in - plane component , which is not consistent with solely in - plane currents if they have an orbital origin .",
    "very recently , a resonant x - ray diffraction ( rxd ) measurement performed at the cu l@xmath2 edge also claimed the detection of orbital currents in the commensurate antiferromagnetic phase of monoclinic cuo , where the inferred anapole vector does not lie in the cuo@xmath0 planes @xcite .",
    "the aims of the present article are the following : ( a ) for a proper characterization of the orbital currents , a second order parameter , the magnetic quadrupole , is needed ; ( b ) the direction of the inferred toroidal moment in cuo is actually 90@xmath3 rotated from that illustrated in ref .  ;",
    "( c ) a toroidal origin for the observed rxd signal at the cu l@xmath2 edge in cuo is unlikely since the e1-m1 matrix elements are extremely small - rather , such effects would be more visible at the cu k edge through e1-e2 interference .",
    "and although symmetry allowed , we believe anapoles are more likely in the higher temperature multiferroic @xcite phase of cuo , where the moments form a helix @xcite .",
    "regardless , we emphasize the presence of a second , independent , order parameter , the magnetic quadrupole , that is time - reversal and parity odd , and has in principle the same order of magnitude as the toroidal dipole , and therefore should play a role in any description of orbital currents . though the presence of the magnetic quadrupole does not change the theory of ref .",
    "qualitatively , some details have to be reconsidered .",
    "we conclude by highlighting some general ambiguities in the detection of the orbital currents by means of resonant x - ray diffraction .",
    "the toroidal dipole and magnetic quadrupole are intimately connected , being , respectively , the antisymmetric and the traceless symmetric parts of the bilinear form @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the position vector of the magnetic moment @xmath6 , with @xmath7 the bohr magneton in si units and @xmath8 .",
    "they can be defined from the expansion of the magnetic energy @xmath9 up to second order in the field ( here @xmath10 is the current density and @xmath11 the vector potential at position @xmath5 ) .",
    "this can be written as @xcite @xmath12 .",
    "besides the magnetic moment @xmath13 , we defined the magnetic quadrupole @xmath14 $ ] and the magnetic ( polar ) toroidal moment : @xmath15 @xcite .    from this , it is possible to identify the toroidal dipole @xmath16 as the second order term ( equivalent order as the magnetic quadrupole ) that couples to the curl of the magnetic field ( i.e. , to currents and displacement currents ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to underline this result in the light of recent literature @xcite : the presence of toroidal dipoles @xmath16 does not necessarily imply a magnetoelectric coupling of the kind @xmath17 .",
    "a symmetry analysis alone does not allow one to decide whether the @xmath16-dipole is rather coupled to @xmath18 , which is clearly not magnetoelectric .",
    "this means that in a magnetoelectric material with an antisymmetric magnetoelectric tensor @xmath19 , one is not allowed to identify the 3 components of this latter with the 3 components of @xmath16 .",
    "in fact , though @xmath20 couples with @xmath16 , we are not guaranteed that @xmath21 couples with the same vector , i.e. , with a current loop around a torus . therefore , a material characterized by both a parity odd and a time - reversal odd symmetry does not necessarily couple to the vector @xmath21 in its free - energy expansion . a coupling with @xmath20 respects these symmetries as well , without showing magnetoelectricity . as such , orbital currents , that can be described through @xmath16 and @xmath22 , are not necessarily associated with magnetoelectricity .    in general",
