    "recently , the development of dilute gas bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) [ 1,2,3 ] has opened up the study of atom laser [ 4 - 7 ] , which is the matter wave analogs of optical lasers .",
    "the ideal atom laser beam is a single frequency de broglie wave with well - defined intensity and phase .",
    "the first realization of a pulsed atom laser was achieved with sodium atoms at mit by coupling a bec from a magnetically trapped state to an untrapped state using a rf pulse [ 8 ] .",
    "then , it was repeated with long rf pulses [ 9 ] and raman transitions [ 10 ] .",
    "+ in recent years , much attention has been focused on the problem of nonlinear atomic optics .",
    "the four matter - wave mixing was realized in the remarkable experiment [ 11 ] by making use of the optical technique of bragg diffraction to the condensate .",
    "the possibility of optical control on the quantum statistics of the output matter wave was pointed out in the framework of nonlinear atomic optical optics [ 12 ] .",
    "several dynamical analysis concerning the nonclassical properties of the output of the trapped condensed atoms have been presented in refs.[13,14,15 ] .",
    "+ on the other hand , there has been increased interest in the problem about decoherence of bec and atom laser [ 16 - 19 ] .",
    "one fact causing decoherence comes from the nonlinear interaction between atoms . for a single - mode condensate",
    "the significant effect of atomic collisions is to cause fluctuations in the energy and hence fluctuations in the frequency , thus causing increased phase uncertainty , eventually lead to decoherence [ 16 ] . in ref.[19 ] , the influence of the decoherence on quantum coherent atomic tunneling between two condensates is studied .",
    "it is shown that the decoherence leads to the decay of the population difference and the suppression of the coherent atomic tunneling . in this paper",
    ", we would like to investigate the influence of decoherence on the nonclassical properties of the output of a bose - einstein condensate by adopting milburn s model of intrinsic decoherence [ 20 ] .",
    "the influence of decoherence on the nonclassical properties , such as sub - poisson distribution and quadrature squeezing of the atom laser beam is investigated .",
    "it is shown that , under very special conditions , the atom laser beam may exhibit stationary quadrature squeezing in such a decoherence model .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii we briefly outline the simple model describing the output coupling of the trapped dilute condensed atoms , in which the nonlinear interaction between the atoms and the quantized motion of atom center of mass in the inhomogeneous magnetic field has been ignored .",
    "then , the quantum dynamical behavior of this system in the intrinsic decoherence model is discussed by making use of bogoliubov approximation . in sec.iii ,",
    "the influence of decoherence on the nonclassical properties , such as sub - poisson distribution , quadrature squeezing effect is investigated . in sec.iv , there are some discussions .",
    "in this section , we consider the output coupling of the trapped dilute condensed atoms . for simplicity , the atoms are assumed to have two states , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with the initial condensation occurring in the trapped state @xmath0 .",
    "state @xmath1 , which is typically unconfined by the magnetic trap , is coupled to @xmath0 by a one - mode squeezed optical field tuned near resonance with the @xmath2 transition .",
    "the hamiltonian of this system is given as [ 14,15 ] ( @xmath3 ) @xmath4 where @xmath5(@xmath6 ) and @xmath7(@xmath8 ) are the annihilation ( creation ) operators of bosonic atoms for the untrapped state @xmath1 and the trapped state @xmath0 with transition frequency @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "@xmath10(@xmath11 ) are the annihilation ( creation ) operators of the optical field with frequency @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 is the coupling constant , and @xmath14 is the effective mode volume and @xmath15 the vacuum permittivity . in the system ( 1 ) , the atom - atom coupling and the nonlinear interaction between the atoms and the quantization motion of atomic center of mass in the trapped state by an inhomogeneous magnetic field has been ignored . it was shown that the above system leads to an oscillation behavior of the quantum statistics between the optical field and the output atomic laser beam [ 15 ] . + in what follows , we outline the basic content of the milburn model of decoherence . based on an assumption that on sufficiently short time steps the quantum system does not evolves continuously under unitary evolution but rather in a stochastic sequence of identical unitary transformations , milburn has derived the equation for the time evolution density operator @xmath16 of the quantum system [ 20 ] , @xmath17 , \\eqno{(2)}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the mean frequency of the unitary time step . in the limit @xmath19 ,",
    "eq.(2 ) reduces to the ordinary von neuman equation for the density operator .",
    "it is easy to obtain the formal solution of eq.(2 ) as follows , @xmath20 where the kraus operator @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 obviously , @xmath23 . + we assume that the initial state of system ( 1 ) is described by @xmath24 . here ,",
    "@xmath25 with @xmath26 the glauber coherent state of the operator @xmath7 characterizing the condensed atoms in the trapped state @xmath0 ; @xmath27 , @xmath28 represents that there is initially no occupying atoms in the untrapped state @xmath1 , and the optical field is in the squeezed vacuum state @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 is the squeezed operator . +",
    "substituting the @xmath31 into eq.(3 ) , we obtain @xmath32 where @xmath33 , \\eqno{(6)}\\ ] ] @xmath34 @xmath35 if @xmath36 , we can adopt the bogoliubov approximation [ 21 ] , i.e. , neglect @xmath37 in eq.(5 ) .",
    "then in the bogoliubov approximation , the density operator @xmath16 can be reexpressed as follows , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the reduced density operator describing the subsystem of the untrapped atoms and optical field .",
    "+ now , we confine ourselves in the resonance case , i.e. , @xmath40 .",
    "we define the operators @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) and @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) as @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 it is easy to obtain that @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 . by making use of eq.(12 ) , we can express average values of arbitrary operator functionals @xmath55 as following @xmath56=e^{-\\gamma{t}}\\sum^{\\infty}_{k=0}\\frac{(\\gamma{t})^k}{k!}\\textrm{tr}[g(a(k),a^{\\dagger}(k);b(k),b^{\\dagger}(k))|0\\rangle_{ff}\\langle0|\\otimes|\\xi\\rangle\\langle\\xi| ] .",
    "\\eqno{(13)}\\ ] ]",
    "in this paper , we investigate nonclassical properties of the output of a bose - einstein condensate in milburn s model of intrinsic decoherence by making use of bogoliubov approximation .",
    "it is shown that the squeezing properties of the atom laser field can be destroyed by the decoherence under most conditions . however , under some very special conditions , the squeezing properties of atom laser is robust against the decoherence .",
    "this phenomenon is highly dependent on the particular modelling of decoherence .",
    "+ in what follows , we briefly discuss the relevance of our theoretical results to the realistic experimental conditions . by making use of the preliminary atom laser experiments [ 8 ] , as a guide to realistic parameter values , we choose @xmath122khz , @xmath123khz , the initial trapped atom number @xmath124 , the mean frequency of the unitary time step @xmath125mhz , and @xmath126 as a example to illustrate our theoretical results . in such a condition ,",
    "the rabi - like oscillation behaviors of the numbers of both the output atom and output photon become frozen after @xmath127 .",
    "however , the atom laser persists in exhibiting oscillation of squeezing coefficient and its squeezing property is finally destroyed by decoherence till about @xmath128 .",
    "+ milburn s model of intrinsic decoherence is currently a very active field of research .",
    "nevertheless , so far little attention has been paid to its study in the context of ultracold quantum gases . however , due to their high sensitivity to decoherence , such systems could provide an interesting testing ground for the milburn model . in this paper , we provide a first step in this direction by studying the influence of intrinsic decoherence on the output properties of a simple atom laser model .",
    "a thorough discussion of all other sources of decoherence that could be present in an experiment and comparison with the results presented in this work should be interesting and necessary in the future study .",
    "it is also very interesting to investigate the entanglement between output atoms and output photons and discuss the influence of intrinsic decoherence on entanglement [ 25 - 28 ] .",
    "moreover , it is worth to discuss the possible quantum chaotic dynamical behavior of atom laser and the quantum - classical corresponding by fully taking account of the atom - atom interaction .",
