    "-.075 in    noise - induced escape from a locally stable state governs a wide range of physical phenomena  @xcite . in spatially extended classical systems , where the noise is typically , but not necessarily , of thermal origin",
    ", these phenomena include homogeneous nucleation of one phase inside another  @xcite , micromagnetic domain reversal  @xcite , pattern formation in non - equilibrium systems  @xcite , and many others .",
    "the concepts and techniques employed are formally identical to those used in tunneling problems in quantum field theories , including among others the ` decay of the false vacuum '  @xcite , anomalous particle production  @xcite , and macroscopic quantum tunneling in a dc squid  @xcite .",
    "recently a new kind of ` phase transition ' , in the classical activation behavior of spatially extended systems perturbed by weak spatiotemporal noise , has been uncovered and analyzed  @xcite .",
    "the existence of a similar crossover , from thermal activation to quantum tunneling in systems as simple as a single degree of freedom , has long been known  @xcite . here",
    "we will review the stochastic escape behaviors of both types of systems , explore the depth of the analogy between them , discuss to what extent the crossover can be thought of as a type of second - order phase transition , and show how the purely classical transition , occurring as system length is varied , can shed light on the crossover from classical activation to quantum tunneling as temperature is lowered . but let s begin with a purely classical problem .",
    "-.05 in    consider an extended system described by a classical field @xmath0 defined on the spatial interval @xmath1 $ ] , subject to the potential @xmath2 and perturbed by spatiotemporal white noise .",
    "its time evolution is governed by the stochastic ginzburg - landau equation @xmath3 where all dimensional quantities have been scaled out . the first term on the rhs arises from a field ` stiffness ' , i.e. , an energy penalty for spatial variation of the field .",
    "the system is stochastically perturbed by additive white noise @xmath4 , satisfying @xmath5 .",
    "we consider only weak noise , i.e. , the noise magnitude @xmath6 is small compared to all other energy scales in the problem ( formally , our analysis will be asymptotically valid in the @xmath7 limit ) .",
    "the frictional coefficient has been set to one , so when @xmath6 is temperature eq .",
    "( [ eq : gl ] ) obeys the fluctuation - dissipation relation .",
    "the deterministic , or zero - noise , dynamics can be written as the variation of an action @xmath8 with the field @xmath9 : @xmath10 and because the dynamics is gradient , the action @xmath8 is simply an energy functional @xmath11\\equiv \\int_{-l/2}^{l/2}dz\\ \\left[{1\\over 2}(\\partial_z\\phi)^2 + v(\\phi)\\right ] \\ , .\\ ] ]    we will mostly consider relatively simple potentials , in particular the symmetric bistable quartic potential @xmath12 and the asymmetric monostable cubic potential @xmath13 both potentials are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : potentials ] .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     here we chose a stochastic ginzburg - landau @xmath14 model for specificity , but one can substitute any of the other classical field theories discussed . for the noisy magnetization dynamics discussed in sec .  [",
    "subsec : nanomagnets ] , it should be remembered that the transition can occur as either length or field is varied .",
    "one also need not choose periodic boundary conditions for classical ginzburg - landau field theories ; the transition will occur in similar fashion ( but with fairly minor differences as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : finite ] ) with other types of boundary conditions . on the other hand ,",
    "one is constrained to use boundary conditions periodic in @xmath15 in the quantum  @xmath16  classical problem .",
    "this mapping is realized when the quantum  @xmath16  classical transition problem is set up using a euclidean imaginary - time functional integral formulation , in a potential where incoherent tunneling dominates .",
    "the classical problem is approached similarly as a real - space path integral in the limit of weak spatiotemporal noise .",
    "but there is a significant physical difference ( leaving aside the obvious ones ) between the two classes of problems . in the previous section",
    ", we were able to consider  for the classical problem  either holding @xmath17 fixed and lowering @xmath6 , or holding @xmath6 fixed and moving @xmath17 through @xmath18 . in the first case one can , in principle , recover the prefactor divergence shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : prefactor ] , while in the second one should observe a sequence of arrhenius @xmath19 non - arrhenius @xmath19 arrhenius transition behaviors , with the width of the non - arrhenius region vanishing as @xmath7 . `",
    "non - arrhenius ' means , as usual , a prefactor @xmath20 not determined by  ( [ eq : gamma0 ] ) , and thereby usually aquiring a temperature dependence . in order to see this dependence",
    ", one would need to repeat the procedure ( fix @xmath6 , move @xmath17 through the transition ) at several different temperatures .",
    "but in the quantum case , there is no such freedom : here the small parameter , @xmath21 , can not be varied .",
    "so a prefactor divergence such as fig .  ( [ fig : prefactor ] ) can not be observed even in principle .    in a similar vein",
    ", the zero mode arising from the use of periodic boundary conditions will differ in the two cases .",
    "this mode arises on the nonconstant ( ` bounce ' ) side of the transition due to translational symmetry  the instanton ( or domain wall ) separating the two stable solutions can arise anywhere in space ( or imaginary time , in the quantum  @xmath16  classical case ) .",
    "this leads in turn to a @xmath6-dependent ( respectively , @xmath21-dependent ) prefactor for _ all _ @xmath22 ( respectively , @xmath23 ) .",
    "it should be kept in mind that we have made the implicit assumption in the classical field case that temperature can be lowered to arbitrarily small values . for many systems",
    "this may not be the case : either transition rates will become immeasurably low , or the system itself might undergo a ( real ) phase change , or new physics may enter in some other way . nevertheless , the ability to vary temperature does distinguish the classical field transition from the quantum  @xmath16  classical one . in particular , the magnetic reversal problem ( cf .  sec .",
    "[ subsec : nanomagnets ] ) presents us with the exciting possibility of continuously tuning through the transition by varying an external magnetic field . with the possibility this presents of experimentally studying activation closer to the transition than",
    "might otherwise be achieved , we might in this way not only advance our understanding of stochastic reversal in nanoscale magnets , but also uncover new information about the quantum  @xmath16  classical transition that the constancy of @xmath21 would otherwise prevent us from obtaining .",
