    "a big challenge of modern astrophysics is the detection of gravitational waves ( gws ) , which would provide a new window to observe the universe . in the same way we use electromagnetic radiation such as x - rays , @xmath0-rays ,",
    "infrared or visible light to study the astrophysical objects , we could well use the observation of gravitational radiation as an efficient tool in the search of the properties of the several kinds of astronomical objects . specifically , we are concerned with the stochastic background of gws generated by double neutron star ( dns ) systems .",
    "the study of this kind of signal is important because it is among the most probable sources to be detected in the near future or , putting in other words , these signals could form a foreground for the planned gw interferometers elisa , bbo , decigo , einstein telescope ( et ) and advanced ligo ( aligo ) .    therefore ,",
    "given the importance of the stochastic background generated by dns , we use it as an example of application of a new method , described in the present paper , to calculate such spectra .",
    "the starting point is the equation@xcite    @xmath1    where @xmath2 represents the dimensionless amplitude of the spectrum , @xmath3 is the observed frequency , @xmath4 is the differential rate of generation of gravitational radiation and @xmath5 is the amplitude of the emitted radiation by a single source , namely@xcite    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the reduced mass of the system , @xmath8 is the total mass and @xmath9 is the luminosity distance .",
    "it is worth mentioning that eq .",
    "( [ bg ] ) was obtained from an energy - flux equation .",
    "this equation was first derived in a paper by de araujo et al@xcite and was used in their various papers . in particular , in a subsequent paper@xcite they gave a more detailed derivation of this equation , showing its robustness . also , although apparently simple it contains the correct and necessary ingredients to calculate the background of gws for a given type of source .",
    "given eq .",
    "( [ bg ] ) and once @xmath5 is known , we are focused on the calculation of the rate @xmath4 .",
    "first , we write this rate in the form    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the comoving volume element and @xmath12 is the redshift . the element @xmath13 is known from cosmology ( see subsection [ cosmology ] ) and @xmath14 will be calculated by means of the new method considered in this paper .",
    "so , in order to describe the process to obtain the stochastic background , we organized this paper as follows : in section [ sec2 ] we show the population characteristics of dns and the elements of cosmology necessary to the calculation of the spectra ; in section [ sec3 ] we explain the method itself ; the results are shown and discussed in section [ sec4 ] ; and in section [ sec5 ] we present the conclusions and perspectives .",
    "for the initial mass function ( imf ) , which is one of the ingredients of our calculations , we adopt the salpeter distribution , namely@xcite    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the normalization constant and @xmath17 .",
    "the normalization of this imf is obtained by means of    @xmath18    where we are considering @xmath19 and @xmath20@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we consider that neutron stars are generated by progenitors with masses ranging from @xmath21 to @xmath22 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that , although the choice of the values for these minimum and maximum masses of the progenitors are subject of discussion , the range @xmath23 is usual in the literature ( see , for example , ferrari et al.@xcite , where the authors used these values ) .",
    "further , discussions on this issue can also be found , for example , in smartt@xcite and carrol & ostlie@xcite .    besides the imf",
    ", we need to adopt a star formation rate density ( sfrd ) , which is another ingredient that appears in the calculation of the background .",
    "there are , in the literature , many alternatives for such ingredient . in particular",
    ", we adopt the sfrd derived by springel & hernquist@xcite , namely    @xmath24    where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and with @xmath28 fixing the normalization .",
    "it is worth mentioning that eq .",
    "( [ starfor ] ) was obtained considering a @xmath29cdm cosmology in a structure formation scenario , where the density parameters have the values @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ; where the subscripts @xmath8 , @xmath33 and @xmath29 referes to matter , baryonic matter and cosmological constant , respectively . besides , the authors used for hubble s constant the value of @xmath34 with @xmath35 and it was considered a scale invariant power spectrum with index @xmath36 , normalized to the abundance of rich galaxy clusters at present day ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that one could argue that a different choice for the sfrd would modify significantly our results and conclusions .",
    "since we are here mainly concerned with a new method to calculate the stochastic background of gws , we leave the discussion concerning how different sfrds affect the spectrum of the background of gws , among other issues , to another paper to appear elsewhere .    with the imf and the sfrd at hand",
    ", it is possible to determine the formation rate of dns .",
    "first , we consider the mass fraction @xmath38 that is converted into double neutron star systems@xcite , namely    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the fraction of binary systems that survive to the second supernova event , @xmath41 gives us the fraction of massive binaries ( that is , binary systems where both components could generate a supernova event ) formed from the whole population of stars and @xmath42 is the mass fraction of neutron star progenitors that , in our case and using eq .  ( [ salpeter1 ] ) , is given by    @xmath43    numerically , one obtains @xmath44 . following a paper by regimbau and de freitas pacheco@xcite",
    ", one has @xmath45 and @xmath46 . using these results , the binary formation rate for dns",
    "is given by    @xmath47    concerning the orbital parameters of the dns , for the sake of simplicity , we consider a uniform period distribution given by@xcite    @xmath48    where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the maximum and minimum periods , respectively .    since",
    "our main aim here is to present an alternative method to calculate stochastic background , the choice above is suitable for this purpose .",
    "however , in order to be used in the calculation of the spectra , eq .",
    "( [ distr1 ] ) should be rewritten in terms of the frequency .",
    "this is achieved by changing variables via @xmath51 , where the period @xmath52 and the orbital frequency @xmath53 are related to each other by @xmath54 .",
    "algebraic manipulations yield    @xmath55    now , note that the frequency @xmath53 undergoes time evolution . following the paper by peters@xcite one obtains    @xmath56^{-3/8 } \\label{freqev}\\ ] ]    where @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the masses of the components of the system and @xmath60",
    "is the initial frequency .",
    "therefore , we should carry out a further change of variables in eq .",
    "( [ distr2 ] ) in order to include the time dependence given by eq .",
    "( [ freqev ] ) .",
    "this is obtained by means of @xmath61 where @xmath60 is the initial frequency , which was associated with the variable @xmath53 in ( [ distr2 ] ) and @xmath62 is the new distribution which , after some algebra , is written as    @xmath63    notice that it would be necessary to perform a further coordinate transformation in @xmath62 in order to put it as a function of the emitted frequency @xmath64 instead of @xmath53 .",
    "such a transformation , given by @xmath65 , is trivial and all the equations will be written as functions of @xmath64 from now on . still concerning @xmath64 , it is related to the observed frequency @xmath3 by means of @xmath66 .      to perform the calculation of the background of gws it is necessary to specify the cosmology and its corresponding parameters .",
    "here we consider a flat universe .",
    "an essential quantity is the comoving volume element , which is given by    @xmath67    where    @xmath68    and the comoving distance @xmath69 for a flat universe reads    @xmath70    where the density parameters obey the following relations :    @xmath71    the values of these parameters are those presented in the previous section .",
    "since we are considering the time evolution of the orbital frequency of the systems , we need to take this issue into account in the derivation of the rate @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ dr ] ) .",
    "we will see that the derivation of this rate comes down to count systems that reach a given frequency at a given moment of time .",
    "we derive this rate by means of an analogy with a problem of statistical mechanics . in this problem ,",
    "the aim is to calculate the number of particles that reach a given area @xmath72 in a time interval @xmath73 , that is , the objective is to calculate the flux @xmath74 of particles .",
    "basically , this flux is calculated by summing all the particles inside the volume @xmath75 adjacent to the area @xmath72 and that move towards @xmath72 with velocity @xmath76 , where @xmath77 obeys a distribution function @xmath78 ( see fig .  [ volel ] ) .",
    "hence , the sum is obtained by integrating over all the positive values of @xmath77 .",
    "adjacent to @xmath72.[volel],width=288 ]    with some modifications , the method to calculate the flux @xmath74 can be used to determine @xmath14 .",
    "first , we substituted the spatial coordinate @xmath79 by the frequency @xmath64 and the velocity @xmath77 by the time variation of the frequency , which is defined by @xmath80 .",
    "so , the number of systems in the interval @xmath81 adjacent to a particular frequency @xmath64 is given by    @xmath82    where @xmath83 is the non - normalized distribution of frequencies .",
    "considering that the distribution @xmath84 gives the number of systems which have @xmath85 in the interval @xmath86 , the number of systems in @xmath81 and with values of @xmath85 in the interval @xmath86 is given by    @xmath87    now , the next step is to determine the forms of @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "first , the distribution @xmath83 is written in the form    @xmath88    where @xmath89 is the instant of birth of the systems , @xmath90 is the formation rate density of the dns and @xmath91 is given by eq .",
    "( [ dist1 ] ) .    in the deduction of eq .",
    "( [ inte ] ) we consider initially @xmath91 , from which we have    @xmath92    which is the fraction of systems originated at the time @xmath89 and that have frequencies in the interval @xmath81 . now , using @xmath90 , we can write explicitly    @xmath93    now , integrating over @xmath94 , we get    @xmath95d\\nu , \\label{app1}\\ ] ]    where the expression in brackets is the number of systems per unit frequency interval and per comoving volume at given time ( or redshift ) , which is the desired distribution function @xmath83 .    in eq .",
    "( [ app1 ] ) , the limits @xmath96 and @xmath97 of the integral are related to the redshifts @xmath12 and @xmath98 , respectively , with the usual expression found in any textbook on cosmology ; further , @xmath98 ( see , e.g. , regimbau and mandic 2008@xcite ) is given by @xmath99 it is worth mentioning that we are considering @xmath100hz ( see next section ) and @xmath101 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath84 will have a peculiar form .",
    "first , note that the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ freqev ] ) yields    @xmath102    after some algebraic manipulations .",
    "then , we conclude that there will be just one value of @xmath85 for each value of @xmath64 , which allows us to write @xmath84 as a dirac delta function : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the total number of systems and @xmath105 is the particular value of @xmath85 corresponding to each frequency @xmath64 .    now , noting that the denominator of the term between parenthesis in eq .",
    "( [ back2 ] ) is the total number of systems , using the function given by eq .",
    "( [ xi ] ) and changing the differential @xmath81 by means of the chain rule , eq .",
    "( [ dmu ] ) assumes the form    @xmath106    integrating over @xmath85 and rearranging the result , we obtain    @xmath107    where @xmath108 is the number of systems per time interval @xmath73 . recalling that the rate @xmath108 is per comoving volume , we may write    @xmath109    and eq .",
    "( [ bg ] ) assumes the form    @xmath110    where we included the term @xmath111 in order to consider the time dilation due to the expansion of the universe .",
    "further , using this amplitude we can obtain the spectral amplitude , which is given by : @xmath112",
    "recall that the main aim here is to see how the time evolution of the orbital frequency affect the spectra of the gw background .",
    "then we considered two cases : first , we used @xmath113 and @xmath114hz as the minimum and the maximum frequencies ( corresponding to periods of @xmath115sec and @xmath116sec , respectively ) ; in the second case we considered @xmath117 and @xmath118hz ( which give us @xmath119sec and @xmath120sec ) . note that here @xmath49 and @xmath50 refer to the period of the waves , while in eq .",
    "[ dist1 ] such parameters refer to the orbital period .",
    "the transformation is trivial in this case .",
    "figure ( [ espectro1 ] ) shows the spectra we generated using the distribution given by eq .",
    "( [ dist1 ] ) .",
    "further , in order to point out the effects of the time evolution of the frequency on the results , we plotted in the same figure the curves corresponding to the case where the evolution is not considered .    ) . note that in each case , in the regions of lower frequencies , there is superposition between the curves generated with ( w.e . ) and without evolution ( n.e . ) .",
    "also shown for comparison the sensitivity curves for lisa , elisa , bbo , decigo , et and aligo .",
    "[ espectro1],width=288 ]    in both cases , we can observe the influence of the evolution of the frequencies on the form of the spectra .",
    "particularly , if the evolution is taken into account , there will be a reduction in the amplitude of the spectra at the region of maximum initial frequency and a spread towards higher frequencies .",
    "concerning the maximum frequency of the radiation emitted by the systems , we are assuming the value @xmath100hz@xcite .",
    "( [ espectro1 ] ) also shows for comparison the sensitivity curves for lisa , elisa@xcite , bbo@xcite , decigo@xcite , et@xcite and aligo@xcite .",
    "the sensitivity curve for lisa may be found at http://www.srl.caltech.edu/`~`shane / sensitivity/.    although the spectra shown in fig .",
    "( [ espectro1 ] ) do not form foregrounds and therefore can not be detected by single interferometric detectors , a suitable correlation of two or more of such detectors could , in principle , detect this background.@xcite in fact , the analysis of the detectability by cross - correlation , among other issues , are discussed in our other paper@xcite to appear elsewhere .",
    "in this paper we shown an alternative method to calculate the background generated by cosmological dns during their periodic or quasi - periodic phases .",
    "we used an analogy with a problem of statistical mechanics in order to perform such a calculation , as well as taking into account the temporal variation of the orbital parameters of the systems . in this method",
    "we can easily change the distribution functions and the parameters without the need of modifying the formalism .",
    "we adopted here a plane period distribution to study the influence of the time evolution of the orbital frequency on the spectrum of gws generated by dns .    in subsequent papers to appear elsewhere we will use the formalism developed here to : ( a ) calculate the background of gws generated by black hole ( bh ) binaries and ns - bh binaries .",
    "moreover , it will discussed , among other issues , how different sfrds affect the spectrum of the background of gws ; ( b ) consider the gw spectra generated by compact systems in eccentric orbits ; and ( c ) calculate the background of gws generated by the coalescence of compact binary systems . in all these papers",
    "we will also discuss the detectability of the corresponding spectra by the present and forthcoming gw detectors .",
