    "the vast energy budget required by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is probably provided by the accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole ( bh ) . evidence that such objects can be found in agn is provided by the keplerian motions of the mega - masers observed in some sources ( e.g. miyoshi et al .",
    "1995 ) , the broad fek@xmath4 emission line observed in the x - ray spectrum of some sources ( e.g. mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ; see tanaka et al .",
    "1995 ; wilms et al .",
    "2001 ) and the reverberation mapping experiments ( e.g. blanford & mckee 1982 ; netzer & peterson 1997 ; wandel , peterson & malkan 1999 ; kaspi et al .",
    "2000 , hereafter k00 ; peterson et al .",
    "the gas in the broad line region ( blr ) resides close to the central continuum source and can therefore be used as a probe of the central mass . in particular ,",
    "if the blr is gravitationally bound and in near - keplerian orbits , it should be possible to estimate the central mass , @xmath5 , from the mean radius , @xmath6 , and the velocity dispersion , @xmath7 , of the emitting gas .",
    "evidence that the velocity dispersions of several emission lines , in particular , are indeed dominated by keplerian motions is presented by peterson & wandel ( 1999 ) and onken & peterson ( 2002 ) .",
    "velocity widths measured either from the rms spectra or the mean spectrum , combined with reverberation mapping measurements of the blr radius , are now available for more than 34 sources ( k00 , and references therein ; onken & peterson 2002 ; woo & urry 2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "although there are some problems with this method ( see krolick 2001 for a detailed discussion ) , comparison of masses obtained in this way with those obtained from the bulge stellar velocity dispersion have been found to be in good agreement ( ferrarese et al .",
    "2001 , gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 , woo & urry 2002 ) .",
    "reverberation mapping is extremely time consuming , requiring that source light curves are well sampled over a number of years and that the sources themselves are variable . as a result of these constraints ,",
    "reverberation mapping has only been used to estimate the virial mass in a small number ( @xmath840 ) of relatively low redshift objects .",
    "it is not practical to expand these studies to obtain masses for a larger number of sources spanning a larger range in redshift and luminosity .",
    "the available reverberation mapping results show a clear correlation between the radius of the  emitting region , @xmath9 , and the monochromatic luminosity at 5100  such that @xmath10 @xcite where @xmath11 .",
    "the uncertainty on the slope @xmath12 reflects the large scatter in the data as well as the statistical method used for the linear regression .",
    "these issues have been discussed , in detail , by vestergaard ( 2002 ) , mclure and jarvis ( 2002 ) , maoz ( 2002 ) and others .",
    "the most recent paper on this topic , by netzer ( 2003 ) , also addresses these issues and comments on the use of the so called `` photoionization radius '' ( see wandel et al .",
    "regardless of the exact value of @xmath12 , such a relationship can be used to estimate @xmath9 in _ every source _ of known luminosity and to obtain the bh mass by combining this size with the observed  line width .",
    "this method has been referred to as the _ single epoch mass estimate_.    reverberation mapping experiments have concentrated on the emission line .",
    "this has restricted the use of the `` photionization method '' to the measurement of bh mass in relatively low redshifts ( @xmath130.9 ) and low luminosity objects , although there are some cases of high - z quasars where the  line has been observed in the infrared ( shields et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) .",
    "the obvious extension to high redshift sources is to use the uv luminosity as an estimate of @xmath6 and the width of a certain uv line ( e.g. ,  or ) as a measure of the gas velocity .",
    "unlike the case of , where the location of the line emission ( @xmath9 ) is known , there is no direct measure of the location of the uv lines except in a handful of sources .",
    "thus , the only solution is to calibrate the known relationship for  against other lines assuming the two must result in the same derived bh mass .",
    "this must be done for sources where @xmath9 is known and where the velocity width of the uv line and the uv continuum luminosity can be measured .",
    "such intercalibration has been performed , successfully , for  by vestergaard ( 2002 ) and for  by mclure & jarvis ( 2002 ) .",
    "thus , both  and  can be used to obtain single - epoch bh masses .",
    "although the results from both vestergaard ( 2002 ) and mclure & jarvis ( 2002 ) are encouraging , their correlations display a large amount of scatter .",
    "this may well be intrinsic , rather than due to poor signal to noise .",
    "one possibility ( young et al . 1999 ; mclure & dunlop 2002 ; smith et al .",
    "2002 ) is that some ( or even most ) blrs display a flattened disc - like geometry . in this case",
    ", the emission line widths would be a function of the viewing angle , with larger widths observed at larger inclinations , resulting in the velocity dispersion ( and hence mass ) of a face - on system being underestimated .",
    "in addition , the k00 original relationship which is the basis of all further work , is limited to @xmath14 ergs  s@xmath15 . thus , mass estimates for the highest luminosity sources are uncertain because of the necessary extrapolation .    in this paper , we make use of high signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath16 ) composite spectra from the 2df qso redshift survey 2qz ( 2qz ; see croom et al .",
    "2002 ) to test the velocity - luminosity relationship in qsos and to obtain new bh mass estimates .",
    "the use of composite spectra minimizes the scatter in the relation between luminosity and velocity width caused by effects such as inclination angle .",
    "it also minimizes the influence of objects with extremely small or extremely large line widths .",
    "the broad range in luminosity and redshift allows us to investigate correlations of velocity width and bh mass with redshift and luminosity .    in section 2",
    "we briefly describe the primary spectral database and outline the procedure used to obtain the composite spectra .",
    "we discuss the method used to measure the emission line widths in section 3 and derive relations between velocity width and luminosity for a number of emission lines in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we extend the work to estimate black hole masses from the uv broad emission line widths and the qso luminosity , calibrating them against the reverberation mapping results for , and discuss the implications of these results for both qso evolution and blr structure .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section 6 .",
    "the data used in our analysis is taken from the 2df and 6df qso redshift surveys ( 2qz , croom et al .  2001 ; 6qz croom et al .",
    "2003 , in preparation ) .",
    "qso candidates were selected from uk schmidt photographic material over the range @xmath17 using their @xmath18 colours .",
    "photometric errors in the @xmath19 band were typically 0.1 mag .",
    "objects brighter than @xmath20 were observed with the 6df facility on the uk schmidt over the range 39007600  with a spectral resolution of 11 .",
    "those fainter than @xmath20 were observed with 2df on the aat with a spectral range of 37007900and a spectral resolution of 9 .",
    "typical redshift errors are @xmath21 .",
    "the median snr was 15 for the 6df spectra and 5 for the 2df spectra .",
    "in total 22041 independent qso spectra from the 2df and 6df observations were included in the dataset .",
    "absolute magnitudes ( @xmath22 ) were computed from the observed photographic @xmath19 magnitude , after correction for galactic extinction @xcite , using the k - corrections found by cristiani & vio ( 1990 ) . throughout",
    "we assume a flat cosmological world model with @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25  mpc@xmath15 .",
    "full details of the creation of the composite spectra and line profile fitting is given by croom et al .",
    "briefly , composite qso spectra ( excluding bal qsos ) were created in discrete absolute magnitude ( @xmath26mag ) and redshift ( @xmath27 ) bins .",
    "a further series of composite spectra were obtained from the qsos binned in absolute magnitude only , as well as a composite contained all qsos .",
    "the numbers of qsos contributing to each composite are given in table 1 in croom et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , typically ranging from 100 to 1000 objects .",
    "the individual spectra were not flux calibrated and each individual spectrum was normalised by a continuum fitted between known emission features . due to the limited wavelength coverage of these spectra it was necessary to treat the large  features underlying the  2798 emission line as continuum .",
    "after continuum normalization the spectra were shifted to the rest frame , interpolating linearly onto a uniform scale of 1bin@xmath15 .",
    "finally the composite spectrum in each @xmath28 bin was produced by taking the median value in each wavelength element .",
    "the median @xmath29 and @xmath22 of the contributing qsos was also determined for each wavelength element    the composite formed from all 22041 qsos is shown in figure 1 .",
    "a number of emission features can be clearly identified , including 3 narrow ( forbidden ) lines , 9 broad ( permitted ) emission lines and one semi - forbidden line (  1909 ) .",
    "the features identified in figure 1 with solid lines are suitable for detailed study because they exhibit large equivalent widths ( e.g. ,  1909 ) , are relatively free from contamination by other emission lines and are visible over a large redshift range .  or  ( fig.1 ; dotted lines ) were not included in our study as , due to the redshift distribution of the sample , too few spectra contain these emission lines for meaningful conclusions to be drawn .",
    "although the use of composite spectra provides a good picture of the ensemble average properities of the qso population , there may be small subsamples of the population e.g. weak - lined qsos for which the any general trends identified below do not apply .",
    "the use of composite spectra may also hide magnitude - dependent biases against qsos with , in particular , weak broad emission lines which would prove more difficult to identify in the original low snr spectra .",
    "fortunately , although the spectroscopic identification of qsos in the 2qz is a function of apparent magnitude , the identification rate is generally high .",
    "croom et al . ( 2003 ) provide an empirical fit to the overall spectroscopic identification rate ( @xmath30 ) as a function of apparent @xmath19 magnitude : @xmath31 for the 6qz survey , the spectroscopic identification rate is more - or - less constant at @xmath32 .",
    "thus the identification rate for the survey remains above 90 per cent for all but the faintest @xmath33mag range of the combined sample .",
    "even for the faintest magnitude , the identification rate does not go below 80 per cent .",
    "finally , we note that as redshift increases , the observed spectrum corresponds to a different portion of the rest - frame spectrum .",
    "the continuum normalization of the individual spectra that make up the composite will therefore be defined by different regions of rest - wavelength .",
    "this has been largely circumvented by fixing continuum bands in rest - wavelength near the lines of interest and interpolating between them to define the continuum beneath emission lines .",
    "comparison of composite spectra generated for different redshift bins within the same luminosity range do not reveal any obvious evidence of such systematic redshift effects .",
    "it is possible , however , that low level systematic redshift biases are present in our data , but we do not believe that they would be sufficiently strong to alter our main conclusions .",
    "the majority of the strong emission lines in the composite spectra used in this study are blended with other weaker emission lines , usually from different elements .",
    "additionally , permitted emission lines such as  and  often exhibit both a broad and a narrow component which are emitted from physically distinct regions and we therefore attempted to separate these components .    to measure line widths , the local `` pseudo - continuum '' on either side of each feature was fitted with a straight line and subtracted .",
    "we modeled the overlapping lines contributing to each spectral feature using multi - component gaussian fits .",
    "we note , however , that assuming a gaussian form for the features in our spectra is a gross over - simplification , and thus the gaussian fits were only used to remove contaminating emission ( which represented only a fraction of the flux in the main line ) with non - parametric methods used to determine the line equivalent width , central wavelength and velocity widths . for the purposes of this fitting process",
    "the narrow emission lines and the broad balmer lines ( ,  and ) were modeled as single gaussians . when possible the number of independent parameters in the model was reduced by linking some together . for example , since the  5007,4959 and narrow  emission arises from the same region of the qso ( the narrow line region , nlr ) it seems reasonable to assume that the emitting gas will have similar velocity shifts and dispersions .",
    "the broad ultra - violet lines , i.e. from  2798 blue - ward , display emission line profiles with very broad bases which can not be adequately modeled by a single gaussian ( figure 1 ) .",
    "they were therefore fitted with two components ; a very broad gaussian ( full width at half maximum , fwhm@xmath34 ) and a narrower component ( fwhm @xmath35 ) .",
    "these components were constrained to have the same central wavelength , with the exception of  as absorption to the blue side of the line results in an asymmetric profile and it was therefore necessary to allow a velocity shift between the two components to fit the line profile . in all cases the best fit to the spectral feature",
    "was found using @xmath36 minimization techniques .",
    "see croom et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for further details on the line fitting procedure .",
    "no attempt was made to model and remove the broad  emission underlying the  feature .",
    "our normalisation procedure treats much of this feature as continuum emission , since there is no true continuum region close to the  line , and it is therefore not possible to model and remove it from the normalised spectrum . the small  feature at @xmath37  just to the red of  line , was modeled and removed .",
    "it was also not possible to deblend the  emission lines underlying the  spectral feature , the ] 1402 emission lines from the  1398 emission line and the ]  1892 emission from the  1909 feature ( although the  1857 emission was modeled and removed from ) .",
    "finally , the broad balmer emission line  proved difficult to deblend as it is contaminated by emission from both [ ] 4358 and  4364 as well as narrow  emission .",
    "since the [ ] and  emission are within 6  of each other they are not resolved in the 2df spectra and were therefore modeled as single narrow component centered between the two lines .",
    "the fit was further constrained by fixing the velocity width of the narrow  and the combined [ ] and  lines to that obtained for the 5007 emission .",
    "once we had modeled a spectral feature , the fits to the contaminating line emission were subtracted , leaving only the line of interest .",
    "non - parametric methods ( rather than the gaussian fit ) were used to measure the flux , velocity widths and central wavelengths of the emission line .",
    "these measurements were obtained for each feature both before and after the contaminating emission was subtracted in order to check for consistency .",
    "the emission lines widths were measured for the composites binned by magnitude and redshift ( 76 spectra in total ; @xmath38 composites hereinafter ) .",
    "line widths have been measured using several different methods .",
    "these methods can be divided into two broad categories .",
    "the most common method ( e.g. boroson & green 1992 ) is based on the full width of the line at some fraction of its maximum flux , e.g. the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) or full width at zero intensity ( fwzi ) , whereas the second method measures the velocity width outside which some fraction of the line flux falls , e.g.inter-percentile velocity widths ( ipvs , e.g. whittle 1985 ; stirpe 1991 ; stirpe , robinson & axon 1999 ) .",
    "the most obvious difference between these two methods is that in the former method the emphasis is placed on the velocity width of the gas contributing to the core of the line emission whereas the latter method takes into account the total flux in the line .",
    "the relative merits of the two methods are discussed elsewhere ( see , e.g. robinson 1995 ; stirpe 1991 ) and it is not clear which gives the most consistent estimate of the emitting gas velocity . for this study we measured the emission line width of our sample using both methods and",
    "comparison of the velocity widths measured for the same line using the two sytems shows they give consistent results .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]      we derived the spearman rank correlation coefficients for the correlation of line width ( as measured by each method ) with the source luminosity for each line ( table 1a and b ) .",
    "the emission lines widths were corrected for the instrumental resolution ( @xmath39=9for @xmath40=5500  in the observed spectrum ) by assuming that both the emission line and the instrumental resolution were gaussians .",
    "the small number of measurements with widths narrower than the instrumental resolution were excluded as were velocity measurements with fractional errors of more than 20 per cent .",
    "we measured the correlation of the line width both before and after the contaminating emission was subtracted in order to determine whether our fitting procedure could be introducing spurious correlations into the data .    _ a priori _ we chose a significant correlation to be one with a formal probability @xmath41 per cent of being due to chance . for the @xmath38 spectra",
    "significant correlations of line width with luminosity were found for the broad emission lines , ,  and the balmer lines  and  ( table 1 ) . with the exception of the emission line ,",
    "these correlations were independent of the method used to measure the line width and whether the contaminating emission had been subtracted . for  only the ipv of the whole feature ( plus the two  lines ) failed to show a significant correlation between luminosity and line width , most likely due to the contribution of the  lines to the red side of the line .",
    "a highly significant correlation ( @xmath42 per cent ) was also found between the width of the combined  feature and the source luminosity but not in the -subtracted  line .",
    "this probably reflects the difficulties of accurately fitting the components in the  feature rather than a lack of a correlation between the width of  and luminosity .",
    "the blue side of  emission line is subject to a considerable amount of absorption and it is probable that  is not well modeled using a combination of symmetrical line profiles , such as a gaussians .",
    "any errors in the fit to the component would also cause errors in the fit to the  component and the -subtracted  is therefore probably not a good representation of the true line .",
    "additionally , any variation in the relative strength of the  and  lines , for example if became relatively stronger with luminosity , would also alter the fwhm of the feature .    aside from , the only broad lines which do not exhibit a significant correlation between line width and source luminosity in the @xmath38 spectra are  and .",
    "is a relatively weak emission line and it is difficult to measure its width accurately . on the other hand",
    "does not appear to vary significantly at all , either in flux or velocity ( croom et al . 2002 )",

    "significant positive correlations between redshift and velocity were found for some methods of measuring the velocity of the emission lines ( e.g. the fwhm velocity of , , and ; the ipv of ) but unlike the luminosity correlations , no line showed a significant correlation between redshift and velocity for every method .",
    "a rank spearman correlation test of our data reveals highly significant correlations ( @xmath53 ; generally @xmath54 ) between luminosity and redshift for all the emission lines except  and  and it is entirely possible that the handful of significant correlations we find between redshift and velocity are due to a combination of the redshift - luminosity ( @xmath55 ) correlation and that seen between luminosity and velocity ( @xmath56 correlation ) .",
    "we therefore derived the partial spearman correlation coefficients ( see croom et al .",
    "2002 for a detailed discussion of this analysis method ) for the data . in this analysis",

    "we find that while the velocity is clearly correlated most strongly with luminosity for the ,  and  emission lines , there is some evidence for a weak anti - correlation between velocity and redshift , significant only for the  emission line . if there is a weak trend for the emission lines to become narrower as redshift increases , this could easily be masked by the strong positive @xmath56 and @xmath58 correlations , particularly as the range of redshifts over which the different emission lines are observed is limited .",
    "the possible dependence of line velocity with redshift is discussed further in section 5.2 . none of the narrow emission lines exhibit any evidence for a correlation between redshift and velocity .",
    "we note that neither the  or  lines exhibit a significant @xmath56 correlation in the partial spearman correlation analysis although both lines show strong positive correlations using the standard spearman correlation .",
    "they are also the only lines which exhibit a weak positive @xmath57 correlation .",

    "it is clear from figure 2 and the regression line analysis ( section 4.3 ) that both line widths of both  and  are correlated positively with luminosity .",

    "our results indicate the  line exhibits a weak correlation between the fwhm velocity width and luminosity and a much stronger correlation between the ipv width and luminosity .",
    "the ipv widths also show a significant correlation with redshift .",
    "we have been unable to correct for the  emission underlying the  line and if the relative strength of the  features is a function of luminosity or redshift , this could cause the behaviour seen below in the line .",
    "for example , an increase in qso metallicity with redshift would increase the strength of the  emission relative to that of the  line and hence increase the width of the broad base ( see figure 1 and section 3.1 ) .      for our composite spectra",

    "the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath45 fitted to each line are given in table 3 and a representative data - set is shown in figure 2 ( the fwhm velocity width of the contamination subtracted data ) .",
    "it is likely that the errors in the velocity widths have been underestimated in our analysis due to the method used to normalize the spectra , underlying  features errors in the subtraction of the contaminating emission .",
    "the estimated errors on the emission line widths do not take these factors into account and hence the errors on @xmath43 and @xmath45 derived using the standard method are probably an underestimate of the true error on the fit .",
    "we therefore used @xmath36 from the fit to rescale the errors on the velocity so that @xmath36 is equal to the number of degrees of freedom and hence achieve a more realistic estimate of the errors on @xmath43 and @xmath45 .",
    "as a further check of the correlation analysis performed above , we refit the data , this time fitting a line of the form @xmath61 . for",
    "a perfect correlation between velocity width and luminosity ( and no errors in either parameter ) the best fit lines of @xmath62 upon @xmath63 will coincide with those of @xmath63 upon @xmath62 . for",

    "the best fit slopes to ,  and  lie in the range @xmath64 whereas the slope of the hydrogen lines is in the range @xmath65 .",
    "previous investigations into a possible correlation between velocity width and qso luminosity have produced ambiguous results . from observations of the  emission line in individual sources",
    "k00 report an anticorrelation between velocity and luminosity with a slope ( in log - log space ) of -0.27 . on the other hand , several authors ( e.g. wandel & yahil 1985 ; joly et al .",
    "1985 ; boroson & green 1992 ; stirpe , robinson & axon 1999 ) have found the width of the balmer lines ( either fwhm , full width at zero intensity or full widths at some percentile of the maximum flux ) to be weakly correlated luminosity .",
    "these studies were all based on samples containing @xmath8150 sources and it is possible that the inconclusive results may be due to the intrinsic scatter in the @xmath56 relationship as well as selection effects .",
    "in reverberation mapping studies ( e.g. wandel et al . 1999 , onken & peterson 2002 ) the rms spectrum of the  emission line is often used to estimate the velocity dispersion of the gas .",
    "the rms spectra , formed from the rms difference between the individual spectra obtained during the monitoring programme and the mean spectrum , measures only the components which vary and , since the emission from the nlr does not vary significantly on short time scales it should not be present in the rms spectrum . at first sight it therefore seems reasonable that the velocity dispersion of the blr gas would be best represented by the  velocity width measured from the line after subtraction of the narrow emission line component .",
    "however , k00 found that there was little difference between the  line width obtained from the rms spectrum and that measured from the mean spectrum without correcting for the narrow line emission .",
    "vestergaard ( 2002 ) also found that the width of the line in the rms spectrum was more similar to that of a single - epoch observation before any correction for nlr emission .",
    "this implies that much of the narrow core of the  emission line ( figure 1 ) is from gas associated with the blr ( rather than the nlr ) and we therefore use the  line width from the composite spectra before correction for any narrow line emission in the analysis which follows .",
    "for the non - balmer lines , we use the fwhm line widths measured after contaminating emission has been subtracted .",
    "a secondary issue is the underlying  emission . as discussed in section 3.1 , many of the  emission features have been treated as continuum , particularly the large feature underlying , and it is therefore not possible for us to correct the emission lines for the underlying .",
    "this may impact on our measurement of the fwhm . in their study ,",
    "mclure & jarvis ( 2002 ) used  fwhm measurements from spectra taken with the international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) which had been corrected for the underlying emission .",
    "they found a linear almost one - to - one , correlation between the fwhm measured for the  and  lines whereas we find that the  emission is generally broader than the  emission . on the other hand ,",
    "some of the  fwhm measurements used by mclure & jarvis ( 2002 ) have been corrected for narrow  emission and in these cases it is reasonable to asume that their  fwhm would be broader than ours .",
    "there is also an  emission line to the red of  ( @xmath66 4930  , see e.g. vanden berk et al .",
    "2002 ) which we have not removed before measuring the  fwhm .",
    "vestergaard ( 2002 ) found that it was not necessary to correct for the feii emission unless the feii emission from the object was unusually strong , and as there is no evidence for strong  emission in our composite spectra , we do not believe this feature will have a significant impact on the fwhm . in any case , we note that k00 did not correct for emission when measuring the  fwhm from their mean spectra .    having determined which measurements of the line widths most accurately represent the velocity dispersion of the gas , we need to obtain an estimate of the radius of the blr . from reverberation mapping experiments , k00 found the blr radius , @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the continuum luminosity at 5100  ( defined as @xmath70 in k00 and @xmath71 for our data ) .",
    "this result depends on the cosmology assumed and the analytic method used to determine the fit .",
    "k00 assumed @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74  mpc@xmath15 and used the _ fitexy _ linear regression method ( press et al .",

    "here we have adopted @xmath79 ( equation [ eq : rl ] ) but we note that a flatter @xmath80 relationship will yield smaller black hole masses at higher luminosities .",
    "the black hole mass is then given by ( k00 ) : @xmath81    where @xmath7 is the fwhm of the  emission line .",
    "the blr clouds are assumed to be in random orbits about the black hole and thus in equation [ eq : bhmass ] the velocity dispersion is assumed to be @xmath82 ( netzer 1990 ) . if the orbits of the blr clouds are not random but confined to disks , as suggested by e.g. , young et al .",
    "1999 , mclure & dunlop ( 2002 ) , the velocity dispersion is @xmath83 , and the black hole masses are a factor of 3 larger than we derive .",

    "however , because our estimates of black hole mass are based on the underlying assumption that the k00 radius - luminosity relation @xmath95 holds for all emission lines , we chose not to adjust the slopes of the observed mass - luminosity relation for each emission line",
    ". the mass - luminosity relationships were therefore normalised by the addition of a constant offset , @xmath50 ( table 4 ) .",
    "assuming that this offset is due to the emission lines being emitted from gas situated at different radii , @xmath50 can be converted to provide an estimate of the radius at which the uv lines are emitted relative to that of the  emission ( radius = @xmath96 ) .",
    "we find that the @xmath97 ( table 4 ) which is consistent with that found by vestergaard ( 2002 ) . from their reverberation mapping study of ngc 3783 ,",
    "onken & peterson ( 2002 ) also find that the emission line lag is approximately half that of the  line although the errors on this measurement are also large .",
    "the calibration factor @xmath50 does not address the variation in the slopes of the mass  luminosity relationships for the different lines , which , if significant , must result from a difference in the measured line width - luminosity relation for different species . since it is difficult to see how different emission lines could give rise to a different mass  luminosity relations ( a line - independent quantity ) based on the same set of qso composite spectra ,",
    "the most straightforward interpretation of this observation is that the different slopes are caused by the contaminating emission blended with the lines .",
    "as we have already discussed in this and previous sections , the  and  emission lines are blended with emission from other elements (  and  respectively ) which would effectively broaden the measured fwhm of the lines , making our calculation of @xmath50 unreliable .",

    "however , mindful the problems associated with contaminating emission , we also fit a mass - luminosity relation to the  and  emission lines only ( fig.5 ; dotted line ) since these lines are the least affected by contaminating emission and should therefore give the most reliable estimate .",
    "for the  and  lines alone , we find    @xmath101    which is slightly steeper than that found for all the emission lines combined .",

    "the error in the fit to the  and  lines is larger than that obtained for all the emission lines as we have fewer data points .",

    "is that throughout our analysis we have used the relationship @xmath105 discovered by k00 and later refined by mclure & jarvis ( 2002 ) and netzer ( 2003 ) . as discussed previously ,",

    "a number of studies have found that the stellar velocity dispersion of the host galaxy bulge is related to the bulge luminosity which is , in turn , related to the mass of the black hole ( e.g. magorrian et al .",

    "this raises the intriguing possibility first , that the nlr in qsos is sufficiently close to the black hole for its motion to be dominated by the gravitational potential of the black hole , and secondly , that the narrow emission lines may be used to derive the black hole mass .",

    "figure [ vel_bm_noscal ] shows the mass  luminosity relation for the individual broad lines separated into redshift bins and appears to demonstrate a lack of evolution in the relation between black hole mass and luminosity with redshift .",

    "it is possible that the fwhm measurements of several of the emission lines are overestimated as they are blended with weaker lines from different elements which are difficult to remove reliably .",
    "we have therefore also derived the mass  luminosity relationship for the  and  emission lines only , as these are the lines least effected by contaminating emission , and find @xmath162 .",
    "our@xmath102 relationships depend heavily on the slope of the @xmath163 relationship which is currently known to an accuracy of only @xmath111 . using the midpoint of the derived @xmath102 powerlaws and taking into account the error in the slope of the @xmath163 relationship , we conclude that @xmath164 .",
    "we find only weak evidence of evolution in the velocity - luminosity correlation , which places strong constraints on the evolution of black hole masses for a fixed qso luminosity ; @xmath165 , @xmath166 .",
    "this is much smaller than that required for the luminosity ( mass ) function of qsos to be due to a single population of long - lived sources .",
    "the 2df qso redshift survey was based on observations made with the anglo - australian telescope and the uk schmidt telescope .",
