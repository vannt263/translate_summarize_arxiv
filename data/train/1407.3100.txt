    "superconductivity in iron arsenides emerges from antiferromagnetic metallic parent compounds in the course of suppressing the magnetic ordering by chemical doping or pressure @xcite , resulting critical temperatures ( @xmath6 ) up to 55 k in sm(o@xmath3f@xmath4)feas @xcite .",
    "relationships between the magneto - structural phase transition and superconductivity in iron arsenides have intensively been studied @xcite . in 2011 the new superconductors ca@xmath0(fe@xmath3pt@xmath4as)@xmath0(pt@xmath1as@xmath2 )  ( 1038 phase , space group @xmath7 ) and polymorphic ca@xmath0(feas)@xmath0(pt@xmath8as@xmath2 )  ( 1048-phases , space groups @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath7 ) with critical temperatures up to 35 k were discovered @xcite .",
    "this new class recently expanded by analogous compounds with iridium ( ir1048 ) @xcite and palladium ( pd1038 ) @xcite instead of platinum . due to the presence of the second metal pnictide layer pt@xmath11as@xmath2 ( @xmath12 = 3 , 4 ) next to feas , as well as the low symmetry of these compounds ( space group @xmath7 ) they were initially considered as rather peculiar representatives of the iron arsenide family .",
    "recent low temperature x - ray structural data together with @xmath13sr spectra @xcite as well as neutron diffraction @xcite revealed a lattice distortion and magnetic phase transition at 120 k , proving that ca@xmath0(feas)@xmath0(pt@xmath1as@xmath2 )  is the parent compound of this branch of the iron arsenide family . thereby closely related superconductors like ca@xmath0(fe@xmath3pt@xmath4as)@xmath0(pt@xmath1as@xmath2 )  ( @xmath14 = 14 k ) , ca@xmath0(feas)@xmath0(pt@xmath8as@xmath2 )  ( @xmath14 = 35 k ) and ( ca@xmath15)@xmath0(feas)@xmath0(pt@xmath1as@xmath2 )  ( @xmath14 = 35 k ) can be derived from this common parent by direct , indirect , and electronic doping , respectively @xcite .",

    "polycrystalline samples of co- , ni- , and cu - doped calcium platinum iron - arsenides were synthesized from the elements as described in @xcite , and characterized by x - ray powder diffraction using the rietveld method with topas @xcite .",
    "compositions were determined within errors of 10% by x - ray spectroscopy ( edx ) .",
    "superconducting properties were determined using an @xmath18-susceptometer at 1333 hz in the temperature range of 3.5 k to 300 k at 3 oe .",
    "magnetic measurements were additionally performed on a quantum design mpms xl5 squid magnetometer which allowed for measurements with fields up to 50 koe at temperatures between 1.8 k and 300 k. temperature dependent resistivity measurements between 3.5 k and 300 k were carried out using a standard four - probe method .",

    "the high sample quality implies smooth incorporation of cobalt , nickel , and copper into the 1038 structure .",
    "the amount of impurity phases increase at higher doping levels , which indicates solubility limits of @xmath21 0.25 for co and ni , as well as @xmath22 0.12 for cu , respectively , in the 1038-type structure .",

    "[ fig : lattice ] illustrates the dependency of the lattice parameters on co- or ni - substitution from x - ray powder data refinement , revealing similar behaviour of both co- and ni-1038 to the 122-type compounds ba(fe@xmath3co@xmath4)@xmath20as@xmath20 @xcite and ba(fe@xmath3ni@xmath4)@xmath20as@xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the in - plane axes @xmath23 and @xmath24 , as well as the unit cell angles ( not shown ) remain nearly constant within experimental accuracy , whereas @xmath25 decreases by about 0.8% in the range @xmath26 , accompanied with shrinking of the cell volume by approximately 0.8% . at this point",
    "it should be noted , that , even if small , the analogous effects of co- and ni - doping to the 1038-structure may be indicative for a similar 3@xmath27 electron count localized at co and ni when doped to feas layers .",
    "an interesting aspect arises from the chemical similarity of platinum and nickel .",
    "although the targeted position of co when doped into the 1038 structure is the feas layer , the situation is more complicated in the case of ni . in this system",
    "fe / ni mixing is expected , but ni substitution to the pt sites is as well imaginable as ni occupancy at the pt vacancies in the pt@xmath28a@xmath2 layer .",
    "however , modifications of the pt@xmath28a@xmath2 layers by additional ni incorporation were supposed to produce 1048-type impurity phases , or at least changes of the @xmath23,@xmath24 lattice parameters .",
    "susceptibility measurements would be a sensitive probe to detect even minimal traces of the 1048 phase due to its high @xmath6 well above 30 k. however , none of these phenomena have been observed .",
    "moreover , additional edx measurements gave no indication for pt / ni mixing .",
    "all these results clearly indicate that no modifications of the pt@xmath1as@xmath2 layers occur , tantamount with co- , ni- or cu - doping taking place only in the feas layers .",

    "superconducting volume fractions indicate bulk superconductivity .",
    "in contrast to this finding no superconductivity was detected in ca@xmath0(fe@xmath3cu@xmath4as)@xmath0(pt@xmath1as@xmath2 ) , except of traces at the lowest doping level sythesized of @xmath19 = 0.02 .",

    "a steep drop to zero resistance is observed for both samples which coincide with critical temperatures from susceptibility measurements , respectively .",
    "the absolute values of the specific resistivity are in the range of poor metals as typical for iron arsenides in the normal state . remarkably , in our case the normal state resistivity increases with decreasing temperature resembling a semiconductor like behaviour .",
    "this temperature dependence of the specific resistivity is different from 1111- and 122-type iron arsenide superconductors , but was also found for the parent compound ca@xmath0(feas)@xmath0(pt@xmath1as@xmath2 ) .",

    "the critical temperature distinctly drops if @xmath19 exceeds 0.075 .",
    "however , full suppression of superconductivity upon high co concentrations could not be archived within the solubility limit of co. samples with a nominal composition of @xmath19 = 0.2 and @xmath19 = 0.3 show only traces of superconductivity which may come from inhomogeneously distributed cobalt . therewith the superconducting dome of co-1038 is remarkably similar to the co - doped 122-compounds ba(fe@xmath3co@xmath4)@xmath20as@xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the ni-1038 compounds reveal narrower dependency of the critical temperatures from the substitution level , featuring a maximum @xmath6 of 13.4 k at @xmath19 = 0.05 .",
    "this finding is in line with the additional electron of ni with respect to co , giving rise of an increased electron doping at same transition metal substitution @xcite .",
    "@xmath6 rapidly decreases at higher ni concentrations until superconductivity is completely suppressed at 17 % ni .",
