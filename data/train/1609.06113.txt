    "the discovery of neutrino oscillations , showing the non - zero neutrino masses , has opened the door to physics beyond the standard model  ( sm ) .",
    "the oscillation experiments so far have provided the rather precise values of mass squared differences and mixing angles of active neutrinos  @xcite . there are , however , unknown properties of active neutrinos , _",
    "i.e. _ , the ordering and the absolute values of neutrino masses , the violation of cp symmetry in the leptonic sector and the driac or majorana property of neutrinos .",
    "in addition , we do not know whether an additional particle is present associated with the origin of neutrino masses .",
    "heavy neutrino is an well - motivated particle in the models of neutrino masses .",
    "one of the most attractive examples is the model with the canonical seesaw mechanism  @xcite where right - handed neutrinos are introduced with majorana masses . in this case",
    "the mass eigenstates are three active neutrinos and heavy neutrinos , and both neutrinos are majorana particles .",
    "usually , heavy neutrinos are considered to be much heavier than @xmath7 and even close to the unification scale @xmath8  gev .",
    "such heavy particles are attractive since they can also account for the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) via leptogenesis  @xcite",
    ".    on the other hand , heavy neutrinos with masses below @xmath7 are also attractive . even in this case",
    "the seesaw mechanism is still effective by requiring the suppressed yukawa coupling constants of neutrinos .",
    "furthermore , the bau can be explained by using the different mechanism  @xcite .",
    "heavy neutrinos with @xmath9 mev are interesting for the supernova explosion  @xcite . if its mass is around kev scale , it can be a candidate for the dark matter  @xcite .",
    "futher it may explain the origin of pulsar velocities  @xcite .",
    "( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite for astrophysics of heavy neutrinos . )",
    "therefore , heavy neutrinos which are lighter than the electroweak scale are also well - motivated particles beyond the sm .",
    "interestingly , such particles can be tested in terrestrial experiments  @xcite .    if neutrinos are majorana particles , the lepton number of the sm lagrangian is broken . in this case there appear various phenomena which are absent in the sm .",
    "the contribution from heavy majorana neutrino can be significant depending on its mass and mixing .",
    "the well - known example is the neutrinoless double beta decay @xmath10 .",
    "see , for example , a recent review  @xcite and references therein .",
    "when the mass is of the order of 0.11  gev , the contribution from heavy majorana neutrino can be significant to alter the prediction of the rate solely from active neutrinos .",
    "the lnv process @xmath11 ( called as the inverse neutrinoless double beta decay  @xcite ) is another interesting possibility to test the majorana property of heavy neutrino .",
    "various aspects of this process have been investigated so far .",
    "see , for example , the recent analyses in refs .",
    "@xcite and the references therein .",
    "it is a good target of the future lepton colliders such as the international linear collider ( ilc )  @xcite and the compact linear collider ( clic )  @xcite .",
    "another example is the rare decay of meson like @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are mesons and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are charged leptons with the same charge  @xcite .",
    "see the current experimental limits on these processes in refs .",
    "heavy majorana neutrino with an appropriate mass gives a sizable contribution to these processes , and its mixing receives the upper bounds from the experimental data .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the lnv decay of @xmath0 mesons induced by heavy majorana neutrino with gev - scale mass .",
    "in particular , we study the testability of the mode @xmath17 by the future experiments .",
    "the expected limits on the mixing of heavy neutrino by belle ii  @xcite and the @xmath4 collisions on @xmath18-pole at the future circular collider ( fcc - ee )  @xcite will be presented .",
    "we consider a heavy majorana neutrino @xmath1 with mass @xmath19 gev which mixes with ordinary left - handed neutrinos @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the pmns mixing matrix of active neutrinos @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) . in this case",
    "@xmath1 have the weak gauge interactions which are suppressed by the mixing @xmath26 . here",
    "we discuss only one heavy neutrino for simplicity , but the extension to the case with more heavy neutrinos is straightforward by replacing @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "if heavy neutrinos provide the tiny neutrino masses through the seesaw mechanism , the masses and mixings of heavy neutrinos must satisfy a certain relation to explain the experimental results of the neutrino oscillations .",
    "however , we do not specify the origin of @xmath1 to make a general argument and consider @xmath29 and @xmath26 as free parameters in this analysis .",
    "it is possible to test directly heavy neutrino @xmath1 by various experiments because of the smallness of its mass .",
    "since there is no signal of this particle , the upper bounds on the mixing @xmath30 are imposed from various experiments depending on its mass  @xcite .",
