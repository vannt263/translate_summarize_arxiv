    "hedge funds are considered as one of the portfolio management sectors which shows a fastest growing for the past few years  @xcite .",
    "these funds have been in existence for several decades but they do not have become popular until the 1990 s .",
    "it is said that the hedge funds are capable of making huge profits but sometimes also suffer spectacular losses . due to their at least apparent high and unpredictable fluctuations ,",
    "it is necessary to keep the risks we take when we trade with hedge funds under rigorous control  @xcite .",
    "the capital asset pricing model ( capm ) is the classic method for quantifying the risk of a certain portfolio  @xcite .",
    "basically , the so - called ratio sharpe  @xcite evaluates the quality of a certain asset by normalizing the asset growth expectation with its volatility , that is its standard deviation .",
    "thus , based on the fact that the asset growth expectation must be large and volatility low , a _ good _ hedge fund holds a high ratio sharpe . and the better the hedge fund the more attractive and advisable is to invest in this fund .",
    "typically , hedge fund managers begin to trade with an specific hedge fund only when this fund gets an annual ratio sharpe greater than 1  @xcite .",
    "it is considered that only if ratio sharpe crosses this threshold the fund can provide benefits after the trading costs removal .",
    "however , the capm theory is sustained under the hypothesis that underlying asset is gaussian distributed . in this case",
    ", investor only needs to know the mean and the variance of the return .",
    "as it has been observed  @xcite , this appears to be an unrealistic scenario in financial markets with important implications in the risk analysis within the mean - variance framework ( see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "the situation is much more dramatic in the hedge fund universe since these funds are clearly non - gaussian having wild fluctuations and strong asymmetries in price changes .",
    "these funds are characterized by their big sensitivity to the market crashes and by trading with products such as derivatives that show a pronounced skewness in their price distribution .",
    "for instance , a very well - known commodity trader adviser ( cta ) hedge fund had a poor ratio sharpe ( 0.19 ) but , despite this mediocre mark , their earnings during the 2000 raised beyond the 40%  @xcite .",
    "conversely , after 31 months of trading , the famous fund long - term capital management ( ltcm ) had an appealing ratio ( 4.35 ) and nothing seemed to forecast its posterior debacle  @xcite .",
    "these two examples are not exceptional cases , and they make us reexamine the validity of the capm theory .",
    "there is evidence that the capm method is not complete enough for evaluating the risks involved in the hedge fund management .",
    "our aim here is to explore some alternatives in the context of the so - called downside risk analysis  @xcite .",
    "the main contributions of the current paper are the following .",
    "we introduce some of the most popular downside risk indicators sparse in the literature .",
    "we also provide new analytical results related to these risk measures and finally make a large set of empirical measurements to the credit suisse / tremont investable hedge fund index data .",
    "the application of all these downside risk indicators to the same data set has thus allowed to revisit them in a transversal way which is quite unusual in the literature .",
    "we have finally found that representing the indicators in terms of a modified ratio sharpe ( see below ) is more appropriate than doing it as a function of the investor s goal .",
    "this replacement with respect what is typically done in the literature makes possible a better data collapse and it in turn enables to compare easily the performance between different hedge fund trading styles .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section  [ data ] briefly describes the data set used for the downside risk indicators .",
    "the following section is devoted to present the backgrounds of the downside risk approach .",
    "afterwards , we present the adjusted ratio sharpe in section  [ adjusted ] , the sortino ratios in section  [ sortino ] , and the gain - loss ratio is left to section  [ g - lsec ] .",
    "the equivalence between the omega function and the gain - loss ratio under specific circumstances is given in section  [ omega - sec ] while a discussion about the error behind the risk measures we use is left to section  [ errors ] .",
    "finally , section  [ conc ] provides some conclusions .",
    "there are several third - party agencies that collect and distribute data in hedge fund performance  @xcite . for this paper",
    ", we have used the data supplied by the credit suisse / tremont ( cst ) index  @xcite .",
    "this company is a joint venture between credit suisse and tremont advisers inc which combines their resources to set several benchmarks for a large collection of hedge fund strategies .",
    "they provide a master index and series of sub - indices that represent the historical returns for different hedge fund trading styles  @xcite .",
    "the weight of each fund in an index is given by the relative size of its assets under management .",
    "this makes the cst index the first asset - weighted indices in the industry .",
    "asset - weighting , as opposed to equal - weighting , provides a more accurate depiction of an investment in the asset class .",
    "in addition , cst has a web site  @xcite that provides an up - to - date and historical data and allows the user to select and download data .",
    "information available is public .",
    "the selection of funds for the cst indices is done every quarter .",
    "the process starts by considering all 2,600 us and offshore hedge funds contained in the tass database , with the exception of funds of funds and managed accounts .    in the present case ,",
    "we have analyzed the monthly data for these indices during the period between 31st december of 1993 until the 31st january of 2006 .",
    "this period corresponds to 145 data points for each hedge fund style .",
    "this is not a very large data set but it is enough to perform a reasonably fair and reliable statistical estimation of the quantities we here deal with .    in fig .",
    "[ prices ] we show the indices dynamics that were all normalized to 100 at the beginning of 1994 .",
    "we also show the monthly logarithmic return change @xmath0 $ ] where @xmath1 is current price index and @xmath2 is fixed and equals to one month . in what follows the return change is always over one month and this is the reason why we avoid to specify the value @xmath2 .",
    "table  [ tab ] shows how the mean - variance framework fails to explain the statistics of the majority of hedge fund styles monthly returns .",

    "for the reasons mentioned above , the so - called downside risk analysis has been gaining wide acceptance in recent years  @xcite . one important benefit of the downside risk lies in distinguishing between _ good _ and _ bad _ returns : good returns are greater than the goal , while bad returns are the ones below the goal .",
    "the downside risk measures incorporate an investor s goal explicitly and define risk as not achieving the goal . in this way ,",

    "this is certainly a different perspective but we here show that the omega function is equivalent to the gl under quite general conditions . as to the case of the gain - loss ratio , we do not look at the fundamentals of the economic theory that lies behind but simply focuss on the statistical properties of the downside averages we take .",

    "for the edd case , the calculation is a bit longer but one can also obtain @xmath120=(\\lambda^4 + 6\\lambda^2 + 3)n(-\\lambda)-(\\lambda^3 + 4\\lambda ) n'(\\lambda ) .",

    "[ theoretical - fig1 ] .",
    "we can observe that the relative error is again below 15% in almost the whole regime of lambda where we get the empirical observations , that is : @xmath121 .",
    "in absolute values the error increases as lambda becomes more negative but its relative value might be quite high for @xmath122 .",
    "the moderate values for this relative errors certainly let us believe that the risk measures provided in the previous sections are reliable enough .",
    "we must however take these bars to the assignation of the errors of these magnitudes with real care since these estimators are strongly biassed as one can see from the definitions in section  [ dr ] .",
    "the standard deviation would solely provide the order of magnitude of that error .",
    "a more accurate analysis of the empirical probability density we have behind each hedge fund style would be required to get a more reliable estimation of the degree of confidence of our observations .",
    "we can go a bit further in this discussion and also check the convergence of these estimators .",
    "we have simulated a bownian realization for the monthly returns with the empirical mean and volatility of the cst index shown in table  [ tab ] .",
    "having 20 , 100 and 200 simulated timesteps , we have computed the excess downside deviation in the same way as in previous sections .",
    "figure  [ simulation ] shows that the convergence to the theoretical curve is quite fast . with 100 steps we already have a reasonable estimation of the edd and with a larger data set what we mainly achieve",
    "is a reduction of the error bars of our estimation .",
    "we have done the same procedure with the upside and downside averages obtaining similar conclusions .",
    "therefore , this experiment also seems to confirm that the results provided in previous sections are quite reliable . at least under the gaussian assumption ,",
    "the convergence of our estimators is fairly reached for the number of points empirically available .",
    "hedge funds have enjoyed increasing levels of popularity coupled with opacity and some myths  @xcite .",
    "we here have followed this recent interest in studying the hedge funds for an academic purpose ( see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite published in this journal ) .",
    "this is possible since data such as the credit suisse / tremont investable hedge fund index is now easily available .",
    "the strong non gaussian character of financial markets have led to consider risk measures alternatives to capm theory in the context of the downside risk  @xcite .",
    "the measures are able to distinguish between good and bad returns compared to our own personal target @xmath35 in a very simple manner .",
    "while the capm theory takes the average return growth and the return variance , the downside risk framework uses another two statistical measures which indeed keep folded some information of higher order moments .",
    "in particular , we have focused on the following risk measures : the adjusted ratio sharpe , the sortino ratios and the gain - loss ratio from both a theoretical and empirical points of view .",
    "we have seen that the downside risk framework provides quite robust measurements and it appears to be the most natural extension to the capm theory and its mean - variance framework .",
    "the hedge funds is a field where these risk measures have most promising future .",
    "there are mainly two reasons .",
    "the first reason is the existence of wild fluctuations and pronounced negative skewness in data . and",
    "secondly is that there are few empirical data points available ( of the order of hundreds of points ) .",
    "this last reason makes impossible to work with other more sophisticated risk metrics which are more sensitive to the wildest fluctuations .",
    "however , we have also seen that the gaussian results for the studied downside risk measures are still important .",
    "we have shown that they work very well as a benchmark if we represent the empirical risk measures in terms of a modified ratio sharpe @xmath42 . perhaps quite surprisingly",
    ", we can also see in figs .",
    "[ sortino - fig ] ,  [ upr - fig ] , and  [ gl - fig ] that the gaussian trading investment behavior works better than most of the sophisticated trading style indices .",
    "the main reason lies on the fact that a hedge fund provides high benefits with the cost of having in most cases a negative skewness .",
    "downside risk measures take into account this asymmetry and include it to the risk perception .",
    "this is therefore another argument for using the downside framework since ratio sharpe might wrongly overvalue the quality of a hedge fund by ignoring the skewness ( and the kurtosis ) effects in risk analysis .    to summarize , let us point out the main new contributions of the current paper .",
    "we have aimed to revisit some of the most popular downside risk indicators and have gone further on their application to the hedge fund universe in two different aspects .",
    "firstly , the use of the same data set has enabled to get a reliable comparison between these risk indicators which is certainly difficult to get through the existing literature . and",
    "secondly , we have derived new analytical expressions for these risk indicators in terms of @xmath42 that allow to get a closer idea on the exact meaning of each indicator . in the same lines ,",
    "we want to stress the fact that the modified ratio sharpe @xmath48 appears to be a more useful parameter to work with instead of the target return @xmath35 .",
    "it becomes very helpful to put the results in a broader context and in reference to a benchmark distribution such as the gaussian one or even to compare different trading styles indices .",
    "thanks to this fact , we have detected several indices with quite similar behaviour for the sortino ratios and in the quotient @xmath41 .",
    "however , the gain - loss ratio is blind to this structure and unable to untangle these trading styles .",
    "for all these reasons and others discussed above , we can conclude that among the sortino ratios the upr is the best risk indicator for the hedge fund universe .",
    "we should however take all these conclusions with real care due to the small data set available .",
    "there is a strong presence of noise that we have here quantified with the standard error and the subsequent error bars computed with error propagation . to check the soundness of our conclusions we have discussed the error in the downside risk metrics when underlying is gaussian distributed .",
    "we have observed that the relative error based on our empirical data set length is quite reasonable being below the 15% .",
    "we have also shown via simulations that the convergence of our estimators is quite fast since a hundred points is enough to get a reliable estimation of the gaussian theoretical values involved in the downside risk metrics .",
    "there are many other interesting aspects to study under the current perspective .",
    "one possibility is to deeper study these risk indicators when returns follow another return distribution like a laplace  @xcite or for instance a power law distribution .",
    "we could also compute the here presented risk measures when target return is another asset .",
    "another possibility is to study the effect of these analysis in the multi - factor market modeling  @xcite . in any case",
    ", all these topics should be left for future investigations .",
    "the author acknowledges support from direccin general de investigacin under contract fis2006 - 05204 .",
    "the authors  @xcite also define the omega risk as @xmath123 this variable wants to measure the sensitivity of the omega function to the changes in the target return @xmath35 .",
