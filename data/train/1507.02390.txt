    "in nature there does not exist a completely closed quantum system .",
    "any quantum system must interact with environment , and the environment in most cases is very complex and often not precisely specified , which makes it extremely difficult to study such an open system .",
    "one obvious reason for us to study an open system is that the knowledge on the system s state can not be obtained without the interaction between the measurement apparatus and the system .",
    "in addition , to control a quantum system to implement some quantum computing and information processes , we have to fight against the decoherence and dissipation induced by the environment  @xcite .",
    "our aim is to study the effect of an environment with finite size .",
    "we model an environment with a one - dimensional coupling cavity array , which may be realized in experiments by coupled superconducting transmission line resonators or defect resonators in photonic crystals  @xcite . in literature , a one - dimensional coupling cavity array with a two - level atom in is first introduced to study single photon scattering problem  @xcite",
    ". then many variants of this model are studied in recent years , for example , a super cavity can be formed by embedding two atoms to control the tunneling or directly decreasing two tunneling strengths  @xcite . in addition ,",
    "when putting an excited atom in the middle cavity of the cca , the atom finally will evolve into two bound states and illustrate the oscillation behavior  @xcite .    here",
    "we study the spontaneous decay of a two - level atom located in one node of a one dimensional ( 1d ) coupling cavity array ( cca ) .",
    "for the atom , the 1d cca can be regarded as a 1d electromagnetic environment . because the length of the cavity array can be controlled in experiments",
    ", we have the opportunity to study the effect of an environment with finite size .",
    "for an environment with finite size , we may expect the spontaneous decay of the atom will not be exponential one  @xcite .",
    "we find that there is a sudden deviation of the exponential decay at some turning time .",
    "we theoretically explain this phenomena as the transition from a naked atom decay to a dressed atom decay , and numerical results confirm this underlying mechanism .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , the theoretical model of a two - level atom in a 1d cca is introduced as a microscopic model of an open quantum system . in sec . 3",
    ", we analyze the condition for the exponential decay in our system , and gives the analytical result on the decay rate . in sec .",
    "4 , we give the numerical results on the atom decay for the cca with finite length , and find that the deviation of the exponential decay is a sudden transition at some turning time .",
    "we give a physical explanation why this happens and predict the turning time . in sec .",
    "5 , after the turning time , we gives the results based on the dressed atom decay , which is confirmed by the numerical results .",
    "finally we will give some discussions and a brief summary .",
    "we consider a two - level atom located in the @xmath0-th cavity of a 1d cca with length @xmath1 as shown in fig .",

    "hereafter , we set @xmath10 and @xmath11 ; the hamiltonian for the free two - level atom @xmath12 is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the energy of the excited state , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is the excited ( ground ) state of the atom . the interaction between the atom",
    "the cavity @xmath17 is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the coupling the atom and the cavity , and @xmath20(@xmath21 ) is the atomic lowering ( raising ) operator .",
    "notice that the total photon number @xmath22 in @xmath3 is conserved for the cca . in the subspace of @xmath23 ,",
    "the eigenstate and eigenvalue of the cca is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is integer with @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) the the photon creation ( annihilation ) operator for the @xmath25-th mode and @xmath30 is the vacuum state of the cavity array .    using eqs .   and",
    ", we can rewrite the hamiltonian as @xmath31 with @xmath32 being the coupling between the atom and the @xmath25-th mode and .",
    "notice that this is a typical spin - boson model to study quantum open system , and here the energy spectrum @xmath33 of the bosonic environment and the coupling strength @xmath34 are specified .",
    "now we study the spontaneous decay of the two - level atom in our system . in other words , when the atom is initially prepared in the excited state and the cca stays in its vacuum state , what is dynamics of the excitation probability of the atom ? in this section , we will focus on studying the conditions for the exponential decay of the excited atom , and theoretically predict the decay rate .    due to the excitation number is conserved in our system , the state at any time @xmath35 can be expanded as @xmath36|vac\\rangle|g\\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath37 and @xmath38 represent the excitation probability amplitude for the atom state and the @xmath25-th mode at time @xmath35 respectively .    through the schrdinger equation",

    ", we can use a cavity array with length long enough and put the atom in a selected location .",

    "figure  [ fig:1](a ) shows the modes condition around the resonant frequency . with the atom set in the @xmath54-th cavity ( the antinode of the resonant mode ) , the above mentioned requirements",
    "are satisfied .",
    "furthermore , in a short time the behavior of the atom state is a truly well - defined exponential decay and with its decay rate well predicated by eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) ( see figure  [ fig:1](b ) ) .",
    "but when time passes a specific point , the evolution dramatically deviates from the exponential line , and the change can be postponed by lengthening the cavity array .",
    "next , we will explain the appearance of the turning point , and show that after the point a new physical process starts .",
    "the key point for understanding the deviation is to clarify the behavior of the modes around the resonant frequency .",
    "we pick out the @xmath48 condition for example , fig  [ fig:2](a ) reveals the evolution of the modes alongside with the atom state . around the turning point , except the resonant mode other near - resonance modes almost all together oscillate to near zero .",
    "fig  [ fig:2](b ) gives a more clear view about this pattern .",

    ", we only show some blue tuned near - resonance modes while not including the red tuned ones , their behavior actually are very much alike .",

    "( [ e8 ] ) is predominant .",
    "then minimums appear near @xmath65 as @xmath66 is positive integer .    with eq .",
    "( [ e9 ] ) we can see when the excitation of the nearest mode ( mode @xmath67 ) reach the first minimum , the other near - resonance modes also reach its minimum ( though they have already oscillated several times ) .",
    "then the time of the turning point @xmath68 is totally dependent on the energy difference between the resonant and nearest near - resonance mode @xmath69 and this is well consistent with the numerical results .",
    "when lengthening the cavity array , @xmath70 decreases and leads to the postpone the turning point as we mentioned before . for the extreme case , a 1d cca with infinite length @xmath71 leads to @xmath72 .",
    "so this deviation phenomenon is actually due to the finite size of the environment .",
    "around the turning point , the effect of the resonant mode will be predominant since the other near - resonance modes are almost empty without any photon .",
    "we conclude that the atom and the resonant mode will be strongly coupled to form a subsystem , the dressed atom  @xcite .",

    "fig  [ fig:3 ] shows that after turning point , the dressed atom decay theory can describe the system evolution quite accurately .",
    "but after the time point when the atom state is empty , the dressed atom system no longer exists , the evolution becomes quite chaotic and unpredictable .",
    "0.5 cm in conclusion , we study the atom decay within the 1d cca frame . by selecting appropriate parameters",
    ", we achieve the well - known exponential decay of the atom state , and theoretically give the decay rate . meanwhile the exponential decay only last a limited time in this model , the evolution deviates after a time point we name @xmath68 .",
    "this is due to the near - resonance modes almost become empty together around @xmath68 , and we theoretically prove the existence of @xmath68 in our model .",
    "after @xmath68 , the resonant mode is strongly coupled with the atom to form the dressed atom subsystem , and the dressed atom decay theory can describe the evolution quite accurately .",
    "finally when the atom evolves into its ground state , the dressed atom subsystem no longer exists , and the evolution after is quite chaotic and beyond our understanding now .",

    "throughout the paper , we emphases that only modes around the resonant frequency are important in the system evolution while the far off - resonance modes can be ignored ( this is also the key point in the weisskopf - wigner approximation )",
