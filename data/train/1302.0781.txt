    "<S> our aim in this work is to study the nonequilibrium behavior of the topological quantum phase transition in the transverse wen - plaquette model . we show that under the effect of a nonadiabatic driving the system exhibits a new topological phase and a rich phase diagram . we define generalized topological order parameters by considering cycle - averaged expectation values of string operators in a floquet state . </S>"
