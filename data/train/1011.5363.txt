    "the state - of - the - art particle detectors and very - high energies reached at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) opened a new window to create and investigate high momentum particle showers in hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "these showers originate from color partons and they are identified as _",
    "jets_. jets were discovered in electron - positron ( @xmath3 ) collisions , where it was assumed : partons are travelling in qcd vacuum .",
    "however , in proton - proton and heavy - ion collisions partons are propagating in a color medium .",
    "the deconfined medium modifies the parton properties e.g. induces gluon radiation and parton energy loss  @xcite .",
    "this phenomena has been seen and investigated in details in heavy - ion collisions at rhic energies  @xcite .",
    "high - multiplicity proton - proton events may behave similarly displaying intense interaction between jets and the surrounding matter. thus , study of jet energy loss and jet - matter interaction can be accomplished with the proper determination of the jets and the remaining background , the so called _ underlying events_.    generally speaking , underlying events ( ue ) contain particles originating from partons outside identified jet(s ) . the first standard definition of ue was given by the cdf collaboration at fermilab  @xcite . in an earlier work we introduced _ surrounding belts _ ( sb ) around the cones of identified jets  @xcite .",
    "here , we focused on properties of near and away side jets , and their surrounding regimes , especially hadron contents and correlations .",
    "we display our recent results on the generalized definition of the underlying event .",
    "we analyzed mean-@xmath4 vs. multiplicity for the newly defined areas in case of @xmath0 tev proton - proton collisions .",
    "we performed pythia simulations for @xmath2 tev @xmath1 collisions .",
    "we used pythia 6.4  @xcite with atlas - csc tune  @xcite for both cases and generated @xmath5 m minimum bias events .",
    "furthermore , we have studied proton - triggered correlations in surrounding belts characterized by various radii and thicknesses at @xmath2 tev .",
    "transition area between jet cones and underlying event carries information about jet - matter interaction .",
    "the investigation of this area demands proper definitions and solid basis for quantitative analysis .",

    "results from cdf - set , indicated by _ full and open squares _ are close to be unity ( no effect ) in all correlations .",
    "this means we are testing homogeneous ue region far from correlation peaks .",
    "results from @xmath18-set , indicated by _ full and open circles _ go below unity for most of the hadrons ( except antiprotons ) , because of the expected momentum conservation for leading hadrons .",
    "antiprotons behave differently due to a strong correlation in baryon - antibaryon production closer to the correlation peaks .",
    "this effect is based on baryon number conservation .",
    "a slight difference can be already seen between the ratios from inner belt and outer belt .    in the case of @xmath21-set ( _ full and open triangles _ ) we are closer to the correlational peaks , but the results are very similar to the @xmath18-set , except the deviation in proton - antiprotons correlation is even more strong .",
