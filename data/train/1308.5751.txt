    "a comic ray reference system ( corars ) making use of the cosmic muons as radioactive source was developed to study the performances of charged particle sensitive detectors .",
    "the system provides the information of arriving time and position of the cosmic muons , which are used to be compared with the measurement of tested detectors , to find out the performance of the tested detectors , such as , time resolution , detection efficiency and so on .    the large high altitude atmosphere shower observation ( lhaaso )  @xcite is about to be constructed in yunnan provence , china .",
    "an array consists of 5137 electron detectors ( ed ) is an essential part of this experiment . to test the eds time resolution , detection efficiency , and photoyield of single particle",
    "is the first application after corars was built .",
    "each ed consists of 16 @xmath0 scintillator blocks , with @xmath1 light fibers to collect light to one pmt .    in section 2",
    "we describe the detector system , the electronics setup , and the daq ( data acquisition ) of corars .",
    "section 3 is devoted to its implementation and obtained resolution .",
    "results of the first testing of ed prototype are given in section 4 , followed by a summary .",
    "corars is @xmath2 high and @xmath3 square meters in cross section as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : detectors ] .",
    "both the top and bottom most layer consist of four scintillator detectors used for system trigger generation and time measurement , and a thin gap chamber ( tgc )  @xcite is placed in the inner side of each scintillator layer for position measurement of cosmic muons with a resolution of around @xmath4 . between the two tgc layers ,",
    "the large space is for tested detectors . by design",
    ", maximum eight eds can be inserted into the detector system to be tested simultaneously .",
    "each of the two tgcs is isosceles trapezium , with bases of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and height of @xmath7 .",
    "the 8 scintillator detectors are plastic ones in rectangular shape , with length of @xmath7 , width of @xmath8 , and thickness of @xmath9 , placed in parallel with small gaps of approximately @xmath10 between them to obtain a @xmath11 areal coverage of corars .",
    "when a cosmic muon enters corars , if the two scintillator layers are both fired , the event will be recorded . the time and spacial information of the cosmic muons entering corars",
    "are measured by scintillator layers and tgc layers , assuming the muon track is straight , which build the basis for the test of detectors .",
    "the analog signals from the photo multiplier tubes ( pmt ) of scintillator detectors are discriminated in n843 , which is a 16-channels constant fraction discriminator ( cfd ) produced by caen company .",
    "if the amplitude of the input signal is larger than the threshold voltage set for the corresponding n843 channel , then a nim signal is generated at @xmath12 of the leading edge of input signal .",
    "the nim signal is then fed to caen v1290n , which is a 16-channel time digital convertor ( tdc ) , with lsb ( least significant bit ) of @xmath13 . and this nim signal is also sent to logical modules caen v965 ( `` or '' logic ) and caen n455 ( `` and '' logic ) to participate in the trigger generation , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : detectors ] . by setting the widths of the output nim signals of n843 to @xmath14 ,",
    "a trigger is generated only when the time difference between the two scintillator layers signals is smaller than @xmath14 .",
    "this can effectively reduce the spurious triggers from noises .",
    "two - dimensional spacial information of the detected muon is given by tgc layers .",
    "there are 64 channels in one tgc layer , 32 of which are responsible for one dimension and the other 32 for the other dimension .",
    "the lvds signals from the two tgcs frond - end electronic boards are recognized and recorded by caen v1190a , a 128-channel tdc module . by then",
    ", the crossing points on the two tgc layers are recognized , and a straight muon track is reconstructed .    as the detectors to be tested , the time and charge of ed s signals are measured .",
    "each signal is firstly fanned out into two identical signals .",
    "then one is sent to caen v792n , which is a 16-channels charge - to - digital convertor ( qdc ) , with lsb of @xmath15 , and another is sent to n843 and then v1290n for time measurement .",
    "a software has been developed using ` c # ` to collect raw data from the vme modules , decode the data and then save it as root files .",
    "this software also does some rudimentary data analysis on line to monitor the operational status of the system .    in order to eliminate the scintillating light propagation offset effect caused by the hitting position on the four scintillator detectors in the same layer ,",
    "a timing calibration of the scintillator detectors was implemented .",
    "each of the scintillator detectors was divided into many pixels of size @xmath16 , thanks to the spacial sensitivity of the two tgcs of the system .",
    "the mean time delay of every pixel relative to a global time reference was obtained . as a result of one - sided readout of the scintillator detector ,",
    "the time delay increases along with the distance between the hit position and the pmt .",
    "the width @xmath17 of the distribution of the time delay of each pixel serves as a figure - of - merit for the time resolution of that scintillator pixel .",
    "the @xmath17 of most of the pixels , @xmath18 to be precise , are smaller than @xmath19 . and among those whose @xmath17 are larger than @xmath19 , most are around the end side where the pmt is mounted . in order to keep a better time resolution ,",
    "these pixels were not used .",
    "a test was done to find out the final time resolution of each layer of scintillator detectors after the calibration . for a muon that passes through the entire detector system",
    ", the time of flight of that muon can be obtained using @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the time when the muon hits the bottom scintillator layer , and @xmath22 for the top scintillator layer . and",
    "a time of flight can also be obtained using @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the distance that the muon travels between the top and bottom scintillator layers , and @xmath25 is the velocity of the muon , which is assumed to be the same as the speed of light .",
    "[ fig : syssigma ] shows the distribution of @xmath26 and the width @xmath27 of this distribution is @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath29 is mainly due to the resolutions of the two scintillator layers .",
    "the resolutions of the two scintillator layers are supposed to be the same , so the time resolution of each scintillator layer after calibration is @xmath30",
    "the performances of the first ed prototype was studied using this system , and the method and the results are presented .      using the time @xmath31 given by the top scintillator layer , @xmath32 given by the bottom scintillator , and",
    "the calibration constants of the scintillator detectors , the corrected hitting time @xmath33 and @xmath34 can be obtained .",
    "then the time when the ed is hit can be reconstructed using the formula @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the vertical distance between the top and the bottom scintillator layers , and @xmath37 is the vertical distance between the top scintillator layer and the layer where the prototype ed is placed . on the other hand , ed also gives the time @xmath38 when it is hit by the muon . and",
    "the time resolution of this ed can be obtained from the width @xmath39 of the distribution of the time difference @xmath40 the histogram of this distribution is showed in fig .",
    "[ fig : syssigma ] , and a sigma @xmath41 is obtained , where the contribution is from both the time resolutions of the ed and corars measurement . according to eq .",
    "[ equ : timereconstructed ] , the time resolution @xmath42 of reconstructed time @xmath43 can be given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 ( refer to eq .  [ equ : sigmascin ] ) is the time resolution of both @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "then a time resolution @xmath48 of the ed is obtained using @xmath49 this value is roughly consistent with the designed time resolution of @xmath50 .    in order to study the time resolution uniformity of the ed",
    ", it is divided into @xmath51 pixels .",
    "the mean value and the width @xmath39 of the distribution of @xmath52 of each pixel was calculated , and the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : timeresuniformity ] .              the charges of the signals from ed were measured . in",
    "the charge spectrum showed in the left part of fig .",
    "[ fig : q ] , three peaks can be seen .",
    "the first peak is the electronic pedestal .",
    "the second peak is the charges of single - photon signals , and the last one is the charges of single - muon signals .",
    "the mean charge of pedestal is @xmath53 , the mean charge of single - photon signals is @xmath54 , and the single - muon signals @xmath55 .",
    "it can be calculated that @xmath56 photon - electrons on average are collected by pmt when one cosmic muon passes through ed , i.e. , the average photoyield is @xmath57 .",
    "the photoyield of each @xmath51 pixel of ed was calculated and is shown in the right part of fig .",
    "[ fig : q ] .",
    "the detection efficiency of the ed was studied as well . when a cosmic muon is confirmed by corars to have hit the ed , the signal from ed",
    "is checked .",
    "if ed signal presents , this muon is considered as being detected by ed , otherwise it is considered as being missed by ed .",
    "the radio of the number of events being detected by ed to the number of total events is the detection efficiency of the ed .",
    "a average detection efficiency of about @xmath58 was obtained for the entire ed .",
    "the detection efficiency of each @xmath51 pixel was also calculated , and the result is showed in fig .  [",
    "fig : timeresuniformity ] .",
    "this `` lower '' efficiency is partially due to threshold definition of the electronic system , and can be adjusted later .",

    "the first ed prototype for lhaaso is tested , showing it has reached the designed level .",
    "a time resolution @xmath59 of ed is obtained . and",
