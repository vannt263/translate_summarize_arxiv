    "brane - world scenarios introduced by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali add and randall and sundrum ( rs ) @xcite are motivated by string theory , where open strings end on branes . in the generalized rs scenario our 4-dimensional friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe is a hypersurface of codimension one ( the brane ) embedded into a 5-dimensional charged vaidya - anti de sitter or reissner - nordstrm - anti de sitter space - time ( the bulk ) .",
    "the radiation in the bulk , the charge and mass of the central bulk black hole can be switched off independently ( for a detailed discussion see @xcite ) , however the bulk will always have a negative cosmological constant , which balances the brane tension in such a way that the 4-dimensional ( 4d ) cosmological constant can be fine - tuned .",
    "branes with various other symmetries were also examined , like the einstein brane einbrane , a kantowski - sachs type brane @xcite and the gdel brane @xcite .",
    "all these cases bear in common unusual properties or exotic matter .",
    "there were also various attemps to find black hole solutions on the brane ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "for example in @xcite the charge term of the 4d reissner - nordstrm black hole solution was interpreted as arising from a tidal charge of the bulk weyl tensor ( and having arbitrary sign ) , rather than from electric charge .",
    "the bulk containing this black hole however remains unknown .",
    "gravitational lensing @xcite and galactic rotation curves @xcite were also studied in brane - world models .",
    "black holes are not isolated objects . in any realistic model",
    "they should be embedded in cosmological background .",
    "the simplest _ general relativistic _",
    "cosmological scenario admitting local inhomogeneities is the einstein - straus swiss - cheese model @xcite , in which schwarzschild black holes and surrounding vacuum regions are immersed into a flrw background .",
    "this model was employed to show that cosmic expansion has no influence on planetary orbits and also to give corrections to the luminosity - redshift relation @xcite .",
    "the einstein - straus model however is unstable against perturbations .",
    "( it is also unsuitable for other type of symmetry then spherical , like cylindrical @xcite or axial @xcite . ) a more realistic model suitable for encompassing ( spherically symmetric ) inhomogeneities would be the mcvittie solution @xcite , which allows for both the flrw and the schwarzschild limits . according to this model",
    ", the cosmic expansion drives the planetary orbits into an outward spiraling and galactic clusters into expansion , which however happen more slowly than the expansion of the cosmic background and consequently these effects are undetectable .",
    "an excellent review of these topics can be found in the book of krasiski @xcite .",
    "recently , the mcvittie solution was generalized both to arbitrary dimensions @xcite and to include charge in 4d @xcite .",
    "such cosmological models with local inhomogeneities were not studied before in the context of the generalized rs scenario .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to study the simplest such model , the swiss - cheese on the brane .",
    "the difficulty in such an approach is threefold .",
    "first , one has to join ( according to the lanczos - sen - darmois - israel junction conditions lanczos-@xcite ) black hole solutions with the cosmological background on the brane , both being solutions of a _ modified _",
    "einstein equation @xcite , such that there is no distributional matter on the junction surface ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "second , one has to extend somehow these black hole solutions into the bulk , which is far from trivial .",
    "indeed , the simplest 4d schwarzschild solution could be embedded in the bulk only by extending the singularity into the fifth dimension @xcite , obtaining a _ black string_. in order to obtain a schwarzschild brane black hole with regular ads horizon , exotic matter has to be introduced in the bulk @xcite .",
    "if the horizon is not compactified through the fifth dimension , gravitons from the black hole will escape into the fifth dimension even if there is an event horizon surrounding the hole on the brane .",
    "the third task is to interpret _ geometrically _ such an inhomogeneous brane as a junction hypersurface .",
    "obviously , for different matter content @xmath0 in the voids and outside them ( where @xmath1 is the brane tension , @xmath2 the brane metric and @xmath3 represents the energy - momentum tensor of ordinary matter on the brane ) , the lanczos equation @xmath4(with @xmath5 for @xmath6-symmetric embedding ) gives rise to different extrinsic curvatures @xmath7 for the voids and for the rest of the brane .",
    "although the embedding ( given by the 1-form @xmath8 , the brane being at @xmath9 ) and the extrinsic curvature @xmath10 are closely interrelated , the latter also depends on the bulk metric @xmath11 and the associated connection @xmath12 . some of the difference in @xmath13 at voids and expanding background can be explained by the difference in @xmath14 due to how near or far the voids are , however the rest should be interpreted as humps and bumps in the brane embedding ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "-0.5 cm     in the simplest swiss - cheese model on the brane we will see that fulfilling the first task is restrictive enough to make the second and third ones redundant .",
    "we suppose the bulk contains nothing but a cosmological constant and its weyl curvature is such that it has no electric part .",
    "the embedding is @xmath6-symmetric . under these assumptions",
    "the modified einstein equation is @xmath15where @xmath16 denotes a quadratic expression in @xmath17 : @xmath18the brane gravitational constant @xmath19 and the brane cosmological constant  @xmath20 are related to the bulk gravitational constant @xmath21 , bulk cosmological constant @xmath22 and the ( positive ) brane tension @xmath1 through @xmath23    the brane is a 4-dimensional flrw space - time ( characterized by scale factor @xmath24 ) .",
    "it contains perfect fluid ( characterized by energy density @xmath25 and pressure @xmath26 , both depending only on cosmological time @xmath27 ) .",
    "the inhomogeneities on the brane are introduced as nonintersecting schwarzschild voids with arbitrary radii .",
    "let us study the junction of one of these voids to the rest of the brane .",
    "the interior solution in curvature coordinates @xmath28 is@xmath29this is a pure vacuum solution ( with @xmath30 ) of the modified einstein equation ( [ mode ] ) in the void regions .",

    "the corresponding general relativistic equations are recovered .",
    "we have identified the angular coordinates @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the two regions , as in principle the comoving coordinate systems can be centered on any chosen schwarzschild hole .",
    "the junction conditions require the continuity of both the first and second fundamental forms ( induced metric and extrinsic curvature ) of the junction hypersurface . in the swiss - cheese model",
    "the junction is made at some constant comoving @xmath38 .",
    "therefore it is obvious to introduce @xmath39 as coordinates on the junction hypersurface .",

    "continuity of the induced metric implies@xmath43these equations characterize the motion of the boundary region of the schwarzschild void and formally they are the same as in the einstein - straus model .",
    "however due to the modified cosmological evolution eqs .",
    "( [ fried])-([raych ] ) , _ the motion of the boundary is changed _ accordingly .",

    "\\label{pp}\\end{aligned}\\]]due to cosmological symmetries , these equations derived on the boundary are valid everywhere in the flrw brane .",
    "therefore eq .",
    "( [ m ] ) can be also regarded as a relation between the mass and the comoving radius of the schwarzschild void .",
    "there are two major differences in comparison to the general relativistic model .",
    "the first is , that the cosmological perfect fluid is _ not _ dust . in the general relativistic limit @xmath53 . if the cosmological constant is chosen to vanish , similarly as in the interior region , the fluid is dust .",
    "by contrast , in the brane - world scenario the nonlinear source term of eq .",
    "( [ mode ] ) implies a @xmath54-dependent pressure ( or tension ) .",
    "this agrees with the general relativistic limit in the low density regime ( @xmath55 ) , however differs considerably in the high energy limit ( @xmath56 ) , where @xmath57 .",
    "while in this later limit the classical condition for dark energy @xmath58 is obeyed , still the perfect fluid with equation of state ( pp ) can not drive inflation .",
    "indeed , the cosmic acceleration is given by the _ modified _ raychaudhuri equation ( [ raych ] ) , which becomes:@xmath59giving deceleration for any positive @xmath20 .",
    "the second crucial difference is the evolution of the fluid energy density , which differs from the general relativistic case . to see this",
    ", we integrate the continuity equation : @xmath60(which is an integrability condition of the system of eqs .",

    "( [ pp ] ) we obtain by integration @xmath61 ^{-1}\\ ,   \\label{rhoaa}\\]]with @xmath62 an integration constant .",
    "( [ m ] ) gives then the mass of the black holes @xmath63 in the voids of the einstein - straus type swiss - cheese branes .",

    "( [ pp ] ) gives @xmath68const as well .",
    "moreover eq . ( [ raych1 ] ) implies @xmath69 and then eq . ( [ pp ] ) gives @xmath70 , thus the flrw region must be empty .",
    "further , eq . ( [ c4 ] ) gives @xmath71 and then eq .",
    "( [ c3 ] ) @xmath72 , thus the whole brane becomes trivial , a _ flat _ hypersurface .",

    "( [ rhoaa ] ) in a different way as compared to general relativity .",
    "a static swiss - cheese universe can not exist neither on the brane , nor in general relativity , apart from the trivial empty and flat universe .",
    "our no - go theorem for static swiss - cheese branes adds to various results concerning the staticity of brane stellar models @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in particular , in @xcite it was shown that for an oppenheimer - sneider collapse on the brane the exterior space - time ( on the brane ) can not be static .",

    "the condition of vanishing pressure at the junction surface was lifted , as in our discussion .",
    "it remains to see what type of inhomogeneous brane cosmological model can be found by lifting some of the original assumptions of the swiss - cheese model . an obvious way to do",
    "this is by allowing a non - vanishing electric part of the bulk weyl curvature , which would contribute as source of the modified einstein equation .",
