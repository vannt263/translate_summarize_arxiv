    "observations by several recently launched spacecrafts have revealed the ubiquitous presence of oscillations in the solar atmosphere , which can be interpreted as magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) waves or specifically as alfvn waves whose signatures were observed in prominences , spicules and x - ray jets by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , respectively . moreover ,",
    "observational evidence for the existence of torsional alfvn waves in the solar atmosphere was given by @xcite , see however @xcite and @xcite who reported the presence of propagating alfvn waves in solar spicules .",
    "alfvn waves have been of a particular interest because they can carry energy and momentum along magnetic field lines to the solar corona , where the wave energy can heat the corona and the wave momentum may accelerate the solar wind .",
    "there is a large body of literature devoted to alfvn waves and their propagation in the solar atmosphere @xcite .",
    "there are two main problems considered in these papers , namely , the propagation conditions for alfvn waves and the dissipation of energy and momentum carried by these waves .",
    "the first problem involves the concept of cutoff frequency whose existence is caused by the presence of strong gradients of physical parameters in the solar atmosphere , and it has been explored for linear alfvn waves by @xcite and @xcite , and for torsional alfvn waves in thin magnetic flux tubes by @xcite and @xcite . the second problem deals with the coronal heating @xcite and it involves different mechanisms of alfvn wave dissipation , like phase - mixing @xcite or nonlinear mode coupling @xcite , and wave momentum deposition @xcite ; however , a realistic modeling of both alfvn wave propagation and dissipation is difficult to perform @xcite .",
    "@xcite considered impulsively generated alfvn waves in the one - dimensional solar atmosphere with a smoothed step - wise temperature profile and a vertical magnetic field .",
    "@xcite studied analytically and numerically the case of periodically driven alfvn waves and their propagation in an isothermal solar atmosphere . @xcite and @xcite investigated torsional alfvn waves propagating in thin magnetic flux tubes embedded in the isothermal and non - isothermal solar atmosphere , respectively .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to extend the work of @xcite and @xcite to an axi - symmetric solar magnetic flux tube embedded in the solar atmosphere with a realistic temperature profile of @xcite and curved magnetic field lines @xcite , perform numerical simulations of the propagation of torsional alfvn waves , and to compare the obtained numerical results to the analytical ones obtained by @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the numerical model of the solar atmosphere is described in section 2 .",
    "the numerical and analytical results are presented and discussed in sections 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "our discussion of the analytical and numerical result is given in section 5 , and a short summary of the results and some concluding remarks are presented in section 6 .",
    "we consider a magnetically structured and gravitationally stratified solar atmosphere , which is described by the following set of ideal mhd equations : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is mass density , @xmath2 is gas pressure , @xmath3 is the plasma velocity , @xmath4 the magnetic field , and @xmath5 is the gravitational acceleration of magnitude @xmath6 .",
    "the symbol @xmath7 denotes temperature , @xmath8 is particle mass , specified by a mean molecular weight of @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the boltzmann s constant , @xmath11 is the adiabatic index , and @xmath12 the magnetic permeability of plasma .",
    "we consider the axisymmetric case in which all plasma variables are invariant in the azimuthal direction @xmath13 , but the @xmath13-components of the perturbed magnetic field @xmath14 and velocity @xmath15 are not identically zero .",
    "we assume that the equilibrium magnetic field is current - free , @xmath16 , and its components along the radial ( @xmath17 ) , azimuthal ( @xmath13 ) , and vertical ( @xmath18 ) , directions are specified by the following expressions : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are free parameters which denote the vertical location of the magnetic moment and the vertical magnetic field strength , respectively .",
    "equations ( 5)(7 ) comprise a special ( potential and axisymmetric ) case of the three - dimensional model which was developed by @xcite .",
    "we set @xmath22 choose @xmath21 such that at @xmath23 and @xmath24 the magnetic field is @xmath25 .",
    "here , @xmath26 denotes the reference level .",
    "the magnetic field vectors resulting from these equations are drawn in figure  [ fig : equilibrium ] .",
    "the magnetic field lines are curved and the curvature decays with height @xmath18 , it grows with the radial distance @xmath17 , and the magnitude of @xmath27 decays with @xmath18 and @xmath17 .    as the equilibrium magnetic field , specified by equations ( 5)(7 ) is current - free , the equilibrium gas pressure and mass density are hydrostatic and they are given as ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",

    "the solar photosphere occupies the region @xmath33 , the chromosphere resides in @xmath34 , and the solar corona is represented by higher atmospheric layers , which start from the transition region that is located at @xmath35 .",
    "note that in equilibrium the gas pressure and mass density do not vary with the radial distance @xmath17 , while they fall off with the height @xmath18 ( not shown ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : ca ] shows the vertical profile of the alfvn speed @xmath36 along the central axis , @xmath23 , with @xmath37 at @xmath38 .",
    "higher up @xmath39 grows with @xmath18 , reaching maximal value of @xmath40 at @xmath41 , and then @xmath39 falls off with height .",
    "this characteristic shape of the alfvn velocity profile will have a prominent effect on the wave behavior in our model as shown and discussed in section 3 .",
    "numerical simulations are performed using the pluto code , which is based on a finite - volume / finite - difference method @xcite , designed to solve a system of conservation laws on structured meshes .",
    "for all considered cases we set the simulation box as 0 to @xmath42 in the @xmath17 direction and @xmath43 to @xmath44 in the @xmath18 direction .",
    "we impose the boundary conditions by fixing at the top and bottom of the simulation region all plasma quantities to their equilibrium values , while at the right boundary , outflow boundary conditions are implemented .",
    "these outflow boundary conditions do no lead to any incoming signal reflection as we use the background magnetic field splitting @xcite . at @xmath23",
    "axisymmetrical boundaries are implemented . along the @xmath17-direction",
    "this simulation box is divided into @xmath45 cells and along the @xmath18-direction into @xmath46 cells for @xmath47 and into @xmath48 cells in the range of @xmath49 .",
    "for our problem the courant - friedrichs - lewy number is set to @xmath50 and the harten - lax - van leer discontinuities ( hlld ) approximate riemann solver + @xcite is adopted . at the bottom boundary",
    "the periodic driver is additionally set as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the period of the driver , @xmath53 is the amplitude of the driver and @xmath54 is its spatial width .",
    "we set and hold fixed @xmath55 and @xmath56 , while allowing @xmath52 to vary .",
    "figure  [ fig : spat_prof_v ] illustrates the @xmath17-@xmath18 spatial profiles of @xmath57 ( left ) and @xmath58 ( right ) for @xmath59 which corresponds to an effective amplitude of the driver of about @xmath60 .",
    "it is seen in @xmath61 that this driver excites alfvn waves which penetrate the chromosphere , and at @xmath62 reach the transition region and the solar corona . as a result of the alfvn speed profile , displayed in figure  [ fig : ca ] ,",
    "the alfvn waves accelerate up to the altitude where @xmath39 attains its maximal value , and higher up the alfvn waves decelerate .",
    "note that as a consequence of the divergence of the magnetic field with height ( figure  [ fig : equilibrium ] ) , the wave front spreads with height and magnetic shells develop in time @xcite and a standing wave pattern is present in the low photosphere , below @xmath63 .",
    "a qualitatively similar scenario can be seen in the low atmospheric layers in profiles of @xmath64 ( figure  [ fig : spat_prof_v ] , right ) . however , the perturbations in @xmath58 decay with altitude , remaining largest in low atmospheric regions .",
    "this conclusion confirms the former findings of @xcite .",

    "the penetration of alfvn waves into the solar corona is seen in the @xmath57 profiles ( left ) .",
    "the presented results clearly show that the wave variables behave differently , namely the gradients in physical parameters have stronger effects on @xmath58 than on @xmath57 because the former decays rapidly with height while the latter reaches the solar corona ; the fact that the alfvn wave variables behave differently is a well - known phenomenon ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of gradients is the main physical reason for such a different behavior of @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and it also leads to wave reflection , which occurs below @xmath68 and decays with time ; the waves that undergo reflection become trapped and this trapping dominates in the upper parts of the solar chromosphere . similar to @xmath69 , the profiles of @xmath58 reveal the transient phase , which occurs for @xmath70 but later on the oscillations in @xmath58 reach a quasi - stationary stage ( bottom ) .",
    "the above numerical results have important physical implications , namely , they show that alfvn waves do lose their identity because their wave velocity and magnetic field variables behave differently .",
    "since the wave velocity variable reaches the corona and the wave magnetic field variable can not , the alfvn wave in the solar corona does not obey any more its equipartition of energy between the two wave variables .",
    "this means that the physical nature of the alfvn wave in the solar corona is different than in the solar chromosphere .",
    "the problem is out of the scope of this paper but it does require future studies .",
    "to compare the results of our numerical simulations to the analytically determined conditions for the propagation of torsional alfvn waves in a solar magnetic flux tube , we follow @xcite and @xcite . with the wave variables",
    "@xmath71 = @xmath72 and @xmath73 = @xmath74 , we follow @xcite and write the @xmath13-components of the linearized induction equation of motion and induction as @xmath75(r b_\\theta ) = 0\\ ,        \\label{moment1}\\ ] ] and @xmath76   ( v_\\theta / r ) = 0\\ .       \\label{induc1}\\ ] ]    according to @xcite , the thin flux tube approximation gives the following relationship : @xmath77 which allows writing equations ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) as @xmath78 and @xmath79 assuming the tube being in temperature equilibrium with its surroundings , @xcite used horizontal pressure balance and obtained the following wave equations for torsional alfvn waves : @xmath80 and @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the pressure scale height with @xmath83 being the sound speed , and @xmath84 is the alfvn velocity .",

    "\\label{cutoff}\\ ] ] having obtained the turning - point frequencies and the cutoff frequency , we may define the turning - point periods as @xmath93 and the cutoff period is @xmath94",
    "figure  [ fig : cutoff_theory ] displays the cutoff period , @xmath95 , _ vs _ height @xmath18 . at @xmath96 , which is the bottom of the photosphere , @xmath97 s. higher up it grows , reaching its maximum value of about @xmath98 s at @xmath99 mm , and subsequently it falls off with height to its global minimum of about @xmath100 s , which occurs at the solar transition region . in the solar corona @xmath101 increases again with @xmath18 but its values",
    "are lower than @xmath102 s. this general trend of @xmath103 is consistent with that found by @xcite , however , the exact values of @xmath104 are different in the two cases . in particular , @xcite found that for the straight vertical equilibrium magnetic field @xmath101 was higher than @xmath105 s , while figure  [ fig : cutoff_theory ] reveals the corresponding values being a fraction of @xmath102 s. this clearly shows how strongly the cutoff depends on the geometry and strength of the background magnetic field .",
    "our numerical results show that alfvn waves - or at least their wave velocity perturbation - penetrate the transition region , whereas the magnetic field perturbation does not , as shown in figures  [ fig : vert_prof_v ] and [ fig : spat_prof_v ] .",
    "the analytical results imply the same as they also show that the two wave variables behave differently",
    ". however , there are some discrepancies between the analytical and numerical results because the thin flux tube approximation , which is the basis for obtaining the cutoff frequency , does not apply to our model of the solar corona because the tube becomes thick and the condition given by equation ( 13 ) is not satisfied any longer .",
    "the agreement between the analytical theory and our numerical model is better in the solar chromosphere where the tube remains thin .    because of the different behavior of the two wave variables , one may look directly at the values of the turning - point frequencies given by equations ( 20 ) and ( 21 ) for each wave variable . since in the photosphere for @xmath106 , @xmath107 ,",
    "a signal in magnetic field is not able to penetrate this region , which explains why @xmath108 is absent in the solar corona ( figure  [ fig : vert_prof_v ] , right ) ; this is an important result , which clearly shows the connections between the turning - point frequencies and the different behavior of the two wave variables .",
    "however , a signal can be seen in this region in @xmath109 ( figure  [ fig : vert_prof_v ] , left ) .",
    "indeed , for @xmath110 the condition of @xmath111 is satisfied only up to @xmath112 , while for @xmath113 @xmath114 . for larger values of y",
    ", we have @xmath115 and the alfvn waves become evanescent .",
    "figure  [ fig : power_of_wave ] illustrates spectral power corresponding to @xmath116 for @xmath109 ( left ) and @xmath108 ( right ) .",
    "a sudden fall - off of power at @xmath117 corresponds to energy being spent on excitation of a non - zero signal in @xmath108 .",
    "thus energy goes from @xmath109 , in which it was originally generated , into @xmath108 .",
    "we point out that for linear alfvn waves propagating in homogeneous media , there is a perfect equipartition of the wave kinetic energy associated with @xmath109 and the wave magnetic energy associated with @xmath108 ; our results show that this perfect equipartition of wave energy is strongly violated in inhomogeneous media ( see our comments at the end of section 3 ) .    in the solar corona",
    "the value of the @xmath118 is larger then a local value of @xmath119 and @xmath120 so the waves are evanescent in this region .",
    "however , our numerical results show a tunneling of @xmath109 ( left ) to the solar corona with the signal in @xmath108 ( right ) falling off with height more strongly , with and @xmath108 being practically zero above @xmath121 .    * *    * *    * *    * *    figure  [ fig : waves_vx ] shows the vertical profiles of @xmath122 for several values of @xmath52 .",
    "location of the last zero of @xmath57 is assumed as the @xmath18-position of a turning point .",
    "similar profiles are drawn for @xmath123 , ( see figure  [ fig : waves_bx ] ) .",
    "note that oscillations take place until the zero of @xmath57 and higher up @xmath57 becomes evanescent as it falls off with altitude above its local maximum .",
    "the oscillatory behavior of @xmath58 until the last zero and its subsequent strong fall - off are clearly seen .",
    "the turning points for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , which separate oscillatory behavior of the wave variables from non - oscillatory behavior , are illustrated in figure  [ fig : pd_vs_t_tp ] .",
    "note that the turning points are located at lower heights for larger values of @xmath118 with the falling - off trend confirming the numerical findings of @xcite , and that the turning points for @xmath58 are located at lower altitudes ( see figure  [ fig : pd_vs_t_tp ] ) .",
    "there is strong consistency between our conclusions based on the cutoff and on the concept of turning points , and the reason is that all these two concepts are related to each other ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper , we simulate numerically alfvn waves which are driven by a periodic driver operating in the solar photosphere 100 km below the solar surface .",
    "our findings can be summarized as follows      it is shown that the azimuthal component of velocity @xmath109 and the azimuthal component of @xmath108 behave very differently in the solar atmosphere ; @xmath109 propagates in the solar corona , while @xmath108 exhibits a strong fall - off trend with height .",
    "this different behavior of the two wave variables can be explained by the fact that the variables for alfvn waves have different turning point frequencies , and that these frequencies are used to define the cutoff frequency ( or period ) , which sets up the conditions for the wave propagation in the solar atmosphere .",
    "the presence of the cutoff for alfvn waves implies that the waves with periods close to the cutoff are being reflected and that interaction between incoming and reflected waves leads to the formation of standing wave patterns .",
    "our numerical and analytical results demonstrate that the alfvn wave loses its identity while traveling in the solar atmosphere because the wave velocity perturbation reaches the solar corona but the wave magnetic field perturbation does not ; as a result , the wave variables do not satisfy equipartition of energy and thus the alfvn wave has a different nature in the upper atmospheric layers .",
    "the obtained results extend the previous work of @xcite and @xcite to describe torsional alfvn waves propagating along solar magnetic flux tubes . from a mathematical point of view",
    ", the previous and current work is different , namely , our study is mathematically more complex .",
    "however , from a physical point of view , there are some differences and similarities between alfvn waves studied in the previous work and the torsional alfvn waves investigated here . in particular , the previous work by @xcite and @xcite was used to obtain the cutoff frequency for torsional alfvn waves propagating along a thin and non - isothermal solar magnetic flux tube .",
    "the approach formally takes into account both @xmath124 and @xmath125 , however , only within the thin flux tube approximation .",
    "our analytical results in section 4 show that the turning - point frequencies are the same as those obtained by @xcite , who considered regular alfvn waves propagating along a uniform background magnetic field , however , the cutoff wave periods are different .",
    "the results presented here clearly show that the wave variables behave differently and that the atmospheric inhomogeneities have stronger effects on the wave magnetic variable than on the wave velocity variable ; again , this result is consistent with that obtained previously by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "moreover , we demonstrate that one of the best ways to account for these differences is to use the turning point frequencies because their values uniquely determine the behavior of each wave variable in the solar atmosphere , and because they are used to define the cutoff frequency ( or period ) for alfvn waves .",
    "it is also important to emphasize that the different behavior of the alfvn wave variables in inhomogeneous media leads to violation of the equipartition of the wave kinetic and magnetic energies in alfvn waves and that this fact makes a clear distinction between alfvn waves propagating in homogeneous and inhomogeneous media .",
