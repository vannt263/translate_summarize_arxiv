    "all cosmic processes like the big bang , the formation and evolution of galaxies , the creation and the growth of massive black holes and the heating of the universe due to large - scale clustering will imprint characteristic radiation patterns on the electromagnetic spectrum of the universe .",
    "the structure of the universe at the epoch of decoupling is frozen into the 2.7 k cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "star and galaxy light , produced after the dark ages by thermonuclear fusion , is mainly confined to the near - infrared , optical and ultraviolet spectral bands .",
    "active black holes in galactic nuclei ( agn ) , which accrete matter and efficiently convert gravitational energy into radiation , typically shine in a very broad energy band , from radio to gamma wavelengths . the role of dust is also very important : it absorbs optical , uv and x - ray light , is warmed up and re - radiates the energy in the far - infrared band .",
    "the extragalactic background radiation , i.e. the total cosmic energy density spectrum , therefore gives a fossil record of all radiation processes in the universe , integrated over cosmic time .",
    "in the recent years , the extragalactic background spectrum has been determined with relatively high precision over a very broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum , apart from some inaccessible regions .",
    "figure [ echos ] shows a compilation of most recent determinations of the cosmic energy density spectrum from radio waves to high - energy gamma rays  the `` echos from the past '' .",
    "apart from the cmb peak , which clearly dominates the energy budget of the universe , three distinct components can be identified in the spectral energy distribution : the cosmic far - infrared background ( cib ) , the cosmic optical / uv background ( cob ) and the cosmic x - ray / gamma - ray background ( cxb ) .",
    "the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) radiation was the first extragalactic background emission to be announced@xcite .",
    "in the seventies , x  ray satellites like _ uhuru _ , _",
    "ariel v _ and _ heao1 _ , which were able to scan the whole sky , produced high - quality xrb maps revealing a large degree of isotropy which immediately led to the conclusion that the origin of the xrb has to be mainly extragalactic and might therefore be of cosmological interest .",
    "gamma - ray satellites like _ sas-3 _ , _ cos - b _ and finally the compton gamma ray observatory extended the background measurements to the highest - energy gamma rays ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the energy spectrum of the cxb has a characteristic hump at about 30 kev and a long tail towards higher energies . at energies below 1 kev diffuse galactic emission",
    "starts to dominate the sky . at 1/4 kev a large fraction of the background determined by shadowing",
    "experiments has been resolved by deep _ rosat _ surveys@xcite .    in the sub - mm to uv range the extragalactic background light",
    "is completely swamped by other background components , i.e. the cmb , the interplanetary dust emission , the interstellar dust emission , scattering from the interplanetary dust ( zodiacal light ) , galactic starlight and scattering by interstellar dust . in the far - infrared range",
    "different groups have recently detected the long - sought residual cosmic far - infrared background ( cib ) signal@xcite by carefully modelling the other components in the high - frequency tail of the cosmic microwave background ( see fig .",
    "[ echos ] ) .    in the near - infrared to uv band , on the other hand ,",
    "the hubble space telescope deep field images are so sensitive , that one can safely assume that most of the cosmic optical background ( cob ) has been resolved into discrete sources@xcite . in the mid - infrared range the bright zodiacal light does not allow a direct detection of the extragalactic background light and one has to resort to galaxy population synthesis models and relatively uncertain upper limits@xcite . at higher frequencies , in the extreme ultraviolet range",
    ", the interstellar absorption basically inhibits the detection of the extragalactic light and the background level can only be estimated by interpolating between the uv and the soft x - ray measurements .",
    "the extragalactic background light seems to be dominated by two distinct humps , one in the optical / near - infrared range ( cob ) , which could very well be produced by the red - shifted star light in all of the distant galaxies , and another one in the fir / sub - mm range ( cib ) , which is very likely produced by dust emission in distant galaxies .",
    "the fact that the dust peak contains at least as much or even more energy than the stellar peak indicates that a large amount of light in the early universe had to be absorbed by dust .",
    "however , what fraction of the dust is heated by starlight or by agn accretion power remains to be determined .",
    "the x - ray range is one of the few regions of the electromagnetic spectrum , where on one hand the sky emission is dominated by the extragalactic background and on the other hand modern imaging telescopes are sensitive enough to resolve a substantial fraction of the background into discrete sources .",
    "the aim of deep x - ray surveys is to resolve as much of the background as possible , then to obtain reliable optical identifications and redshifts of the x - ray sources and finally for all classes of objects to determine luminosity functions and their cosmological evolution ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "since the emitted light , integrated over cosmic time can be compared directly to the total x - ray background , important constraints on the cosmological evolution and possible residual diffuse intergalactic emission can be obtained .    a large number of deep",
    ", medium - deep and shallower surveys have been performed with _ rosat _ ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "deep surveys in the lockman hole ( see [ hri]a ) have so far been the deepest x - ray observations ever performed ( until the deep _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ surveys will be completed ) .",
    "they reach a source density of @xmath0 at the faintest flux limit , where 7080% of the soft x ",
    "ray background has been resolved into discrete sources@xcite .",
    "deep r - band images have been obtained at the keck telescope . in the lockman hole",
    "deep survey most optical counterparts have magnitudes in the range r=1823 . with the excellent hri positions typically only one or two counterparts are within the x  ray error circle .",
    "spectra of the optical counterparts of the x - ray sources were mostly obtained with the keck telescope .",
    "currently 85 out of 91 x  ray sources are spectroscopically identified . about 80% of those turned out to be active galactic nuclei@xcite , among them the highest redshift x",
    " ray selected qso at z=4.45@xcite .",
    "most agn are luminous qsos and sy1 galaxies with broad emission lines .",
    "however about 16% show only narrow emission lines and are classified as seyfert 2 galaxies@xcite .",
    "there is a group of x - ray sources in the lockman hole , which have optical counterparts fainter than r=24 , for which optical spectroscopy was not possible , even with the keck telescope . for these one",
    "has to resort to nir photometry and photometric redshifts .",
    "it turns out that the spectroscopically unidentified objects typically have very red r - k colours@xcite .",
    "figure [ hri]b shows a correlation diagram between the r - k colours and redshifts for different types of objects identified in the lockman hole in comparison with normal galaxy colours predicted from evolutionary models .",
    "the colours of type-1 agn are relatively blue and scatter widely , while type-2 agn and cluster galaxies show on average much redder colours , correlating well with redshift in the region expected for normal galaxies .",
    "this indicates that the optical colours of type-2 agn are dominated by the light from the host galaxy , probably because the optical nucleus is obscured .",
    "a population of heavily obscured agn is thus already showing up in the soft x - ray band . based on r - k colours and photometric redshifts",
    "it is likely that the as yet unidentified sources are dust shrouded agn in the redshift range 1 - 2 .",
    "there is , however , an interesting dichotomy in the redshift distribution of the sources .",
    "unobscured objects ( solid circles ) are found to @xmath1 , while the obscured objects ( open circles , pluses ) are restricted to @xmath2 . there is a  negative k - correction effect  for obscured objects at soft x - rays : at higher redshifts it is easier to detect obscured x - ray sources , because their unobscured rest - frame hard x - ray emission is shifted into the observed soft x - ray band .",
    "the fact that we do not find obscured objects at high redshifts could indicate a dependence of obscuration on intrisic source luminosity .",
    "high luminosity x - ray sources to some degree could be able to  clean out  their environment from obscuring material .",
    "the x  ray background has a significantly harder spectrum than that of local unobscured agn .",
    "this led to the assumption that a large fraction of the background flux is due to obscured agn , as originally proposed by setti and woltjer @xcite .",
    "models following the unified agn schemes , assuming an appropriate mixture of absorbed and unabsorbed agn spectra folded with cosmological agn evolution models , can in principle explain the shape of the background spectrum over the whole x  ray band ( e.g. @xcite ) , but gave problems with a number of new observational constraints@xcite .",
    "apart from the agn cosmological evolution@xcite , the distribution of absorption column densities among different types of agn and as a function of redshift is one of the major uncertainties .",
    "the standard x  ray background population synthesis models ( e.g. @xcite ) assume that the absorption distribution , which has been determined observationally only for local seyfert galaxies , is independent of x  ray luminosity and redshift .",
    "in particular , the fraction of type-2 qsos , obscured high - luminosity x - ray sources , should be as high as that of seyfert-2 galaxies .",
    "this assumption , however , has been proven wrong by recent observations ( see e.g. fig . [ hri]b , @xcite ) .",
    "the current x - ray background models therefore still have rather limited predictive power .    a significant improvement in our understanding of the hard x - ray background is to be expected from optical identifications of complete samples of sources selected at faint fluxes in the hard x  ray band .",
    "deep surveys performed with _ asca_@xcite and _ bepposax_@xcite have recently resolved about 30% of the harder x - ray background , but due to very limited angular resolution their optical identification is tedious and in the case of faint optical counterparts almost impossible . upcoming deep surveys with the _ chandra _ observatory ( _ axafi _ ) and _ xmm _ with very high sensitivity and good positional accuracy in the hard band together with optical identifications from the vlt and the keck telescopes are expected to yield a solid statistical basis to disentangle these various effects and lead to a new , unambiguous population synthesis for the x  ray background .",
    "an immediate consequence of the obscured background models is that the radiation produced by accretion processes in agn emerges completely unabsorbed only at energies well above 10 kev , thus producing the observed maximum of the xrb energy density at @xmath3 kev .",
    "comparison between the background energy density at 30 kev and at 1 kev leads to the suggestion that most ( 8090% ) of the accretion power in the universe might be absorbed , implying a very large solid angle of the obscuring material as seen from the central source .",
    "fabian et al .",
    "@xcite suggest that circumnuclear starburst regions are responsible for the large covering factor",
    ". they may be both triggering and obscuring most of the nuclear activity .",
    "recently fabian and iwasawa @xcite have shown that these agn background synthesis models can explain the mass distribution of dark remnant black holes in the centers of nearby galaxies by conventional accretion which is largely hidden by obscuration .",
    "the obscured background synthesis models has important consequences for the current attempts to understand black hole and galaxy formation and evolution",
    ". the absorbed agn will suffer severe extinction and therefore , unlike classical qsos , would not be prominent at optical wavelengths .",
    "the light of the optical counterparts of distant absorbed x - ray sources should therefore be dominated by the host galaxy , which indeed seems to be the case for a significant number of faint x - ray sources ( see fig [ hri]b ) .",
    "if most of the accretion power is being absorbed by gas and dust , it will have to be reradiated in the fir range and be redshifted into the sub ",
    "agn could therefore contribute a substantial fraction to the cosmic fir / sub  mm background which has already partly been resolved by deep scuba surveys .",
    "the background population synthesis models have recently been used by almaini et al .",
    "@xcite to predict the agn contribution to the sub ",
    "mm background and source counts . depending on the assumptions about cosmology and agn space density at high redshifts",
    "they predict that a substantial fraction of the sub  mm source counts at the current scuba flux limit could be associated with active galactic nuclei .",
    "interestingly , the first optical identifications of scuba sources indicate a significant agn contribution@xcite .",
    "another , largely independent line of arguments leads to the conclusion that accretion processes may produce an important contribution to the extragalactic background light .",
    "dynamical studies@xcite come to the conclusion that massive dark objects , most likely dormant black holes , are ubiquitous in nearby galaxies .",
    "there is a correlation between the black hole mass and the bulge mass of a galaxy : @xmath4 .",
    "since gravitational energy release through standard accretion of matter onto a black hole is producing radiation about 100 times more efficiently than the thermonuclear fusion processes in stars , the total amount of light produced by accretion in the universe should be of the same order of magnitude as that produced by stars . a more detailed treatment following this argument comes to the conclusion that the bolometric agn contribution should be about 1/5 of the stellar light in the universe@xcite .",
    "the ultraluminous iras galaxy ngc 6420 is a starburst galaxy with a double nucleus@xcite with some evidence for a weak active nucleus .",
    "its position in the mid - infrared diagnostic diagram based on iso spectroscopy @xcite indicates that its bolometric luminosity , which is dominated by the far - infrared dust emission , should be mainly heated by star formation processes .",
    "recently , however , _ bepposax _",
    "hard x - ray spectroscopy revealed an underlying very luminous , though heavily obscured active galactic nucleus , which could well be responsible for the major fraction of the bolometric luminosity .",
    "figure [ sed ] shows the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of ngc 6240 in a @xmath5 representation from the radio to the hard x - ray band .",
    "the sed peaks in the far - infrared dust band and shows the mid - infrared policyclic aromatic hydrocarbonic emission bands as well as the synchrotron radio emission typical for starburst galaxies .",
    "the optical starlight peak is lower than the dust emission peak - similar to the overall extragalactic energy distribution . in the hard x - ray range",
    "the nonthermal agn continuum emission is severely absorbed below 15 kev and strong reprocessed iron line is seen .",
    "the uv to soft x - ray nuclear continuum is completely obscured .",
    "the seds of three agn from the _ rosat _ deep survey in the lockman hole , which have been observed over a broad wavelength range from radio to x - rays have been superposed on this diagram .",
    "these are ( see @xcite ) : 32a , a qso / sy1 at @xmath6=1.33 ( crosses ) , 12a a sy2 at @xmath6=0.99 ( filled circles ) and 14z , a very red object , probably a sy2 galaxy , with @xmath7@xcite .",
    "the radio detections and upper limits at 20 cm and 6 cm are from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the upper limit in the millimeter - range for 14z has been obtained with iram@xcite . in the x - ray range",
    "the _ rosat pspc _ spectra of these three sources have been fitted with a power law with galactic or intrinsic absorption . for a comparison on the same absolute scale the lockman seds",
    "have been shifted to the redshift of ngc 6240 and scaled by the square of their luminosity distances .",
    "the two absorbed _ rosat _ sources ( 12a and 14z ) have seds surprisingly similar to ngc 6240 .",
    "the galaxy 12a may have a relatively stronger starburst component , indicated by its higher radio luminosity .",
    "the main difference lies in the x - ray range , where the luminosity at hard x - ray energies is very similar for all 3 sources , while the intrinsic absorption is clearly different : @xmath8 is about @xmath9 for ngc6420 , @xmath10 for 14z and @xmath11 for 12a .",
    "in contrast , the sed for the radio - quiet qso 32a , while fitting relatively well to the other sources in the radio band , is clearly dominated by the unobscured light of the active nucleus in the optical and x - ray range .",
    "this figure is a nice illustration of the obscured agn model for the x - ray background and its potential relevance to the fir / sub - mm background , since it shows that x - ray - selected high - redshift agn can indeed have seds similar to local ulirgs .",
    "unfortunately there are no observations yet , which are sensitive enough both in the x - ray band and in the sub - mm band to obtain a better quantitative estimate of the fraction of the far - infrared background produced by agn .",
    "future joint sub ",
    "mm / x  ray deep surveys will therefore be a very powerful tool to disentangle the different processes dominating the universe at high redshift .",
