    "choptuik s discovery of critical phenomena in gravitational collapse of a scalar field @xcite sparkled a surge of interest in gravitational collapse just at the threshold of black hole formation .",
    "discovery of critical behavior in several other matter models quickly followed . while perhaps the presence of critical behavior in gravitational collapse is not in itself surprising , some of its features are , in particular the conclusion that black holes of arbitrary small mass can be formed in the process .",
    "moreover , the critical solution often displays additional peculiar symmetry  the so - called self - similarity , and serves as an intermediate attractor for near - critical solutions .",
    "study of critical phenomena also throws new light on the cosmic censorship conjecture . the formation of strong curvature singularity in critical collapse from regular initial data offers a new counterexample to the cosmic censorship conjecture .",
    "much work has been done , and general features of critical behavior are now understood . however , there is a distinct and uncomfortable lack of analytical solutions . due to the obvious difficulties in obtaining solutions of einstein equations in closed form , most of the work seems to be done numerically .",
    "one of the few known closed form solutions related to critical phenomena is roberts solution , originally constructed as a counterexample to the cosmic censorship conjecture @xcite , and later rediscovered in the context of critical gravitational collapse .",
    "it is a continuously self - similar solution of a spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of a minimally coupled massless scalar field in four dimensional spacetime . for review of the role self - similarity",

    "this paper searches for continuously self - similar , spherically symmetric scalar field solutions in @xmath0 dimensions",
    ". they might be relevant in context of the superstring theory , which is often said to be the next `` theory of everything '' , as well as for understanding how critical behavior depends on the dimensionality of the spacetime .",
    "roberts solution would be a particular case of the solutions discussed here .",
    "these solutions provide reasonably simple toy models of critical collapse , although they are not attractors @xcite .",
    "some qualitative properties of the self - similar critical collapse of scalar field in higher dimensions have been discussed in . here",
    "we aim at finding explicit closed - form solutions .",
    "second part of this paper deals with extension of minimally coupled scalar field solutions to a wider class of couplings .",
    "it is shown how different couplings of scalar field are equivalent , and several particular models are examined in details .",
    "procedure discussed here can be applied to any solution of einstein - scalar field equations .",
    "evolution of the minimally coupled scalar field in @xmath0 dimensions is described by action @xmath1\\ ] ] plus surface terms .",
    "field equations are obtained by varying this action with respect to field variables @xmath2 and @xmath3 . however ,",

    "we are interested in generalization of roberts solution to @xmath0 dimensions . to find it , we write the metric in double null coordinates @xmath17 the dependence of metric coefficients and @xmath3 on @xmath18 only reflects the fact that we are looking for continuously self - similar solution , with @xmath19 being scale - invariant variable .",
    "we turn on the influx of the scalar field at the advanced time @xmath20 , so that the spacetime is minkowskian to the past of this surface , and the initial conditions are specified by continuity",

    "initial conditions imply that initially @xmath46 comes from infinity towards zero , i.e.  its derivative is negative , and so we must pick the branch of the solution which started out with a minus sign .",
    "constant @xmath56 corresponds to a coordinate freedom in choice of origin of @xmath42 , while constant @xmath57 is a real parameter of the solution .",
    "unfortunately , the integral can not be evaluated in a closed form for arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "but if the integral is evaluated , and we can invert it to get @xmath46 as a function of @xmath42 , the solution for @xmath8 is obtained by using definitions ( [ eq : soln : subst ] ) and ( [ eq : soln : metric ] ) . the solution for @xmath3 is obtained by integrating relations ( [ eq : soln : phi ] ) or ( [ eq : soln : int : phi ] ) .",
    "one - parameter family of self - similar scalar field solutions in @xmath0 dimensions we constructed above exhibits critical behavior as the parameter @xmath57 is tuned , much as roberts family does in four dimensions . in this section",
    "we investigate black hole formation in the collapse .    in spherical symmetry , existence and position of the apparent horizon",
    "are given by vanishing of @xmath58 , which translates to @xmath59 , or @xmath60 in our notation .",

    "this case is subcritical evolution of the field . if @xmath68 , the value of @xmath46 reaches point where apparent horizon is formed , and proceeds to go to zero , at which place there is a singularity inside the black hole .",

    "[ fig : supercritical ] .",
    "the mass of the black hole formed in the supercritical collapse is @xmath69 it grows infinitely if we wait long enough , and will absorb all the field influx coming from past infinity .",
    "this happens because the solution is self - similar , and creates a problem for discussing mass scaling in the near - critical collapse .",
    "cut and glue schemes avoiding infinite black hole mass are temporary means to lift this problem .",
    "however , the real answer to determining if the critical solution is intermediate attractor and calculating mass - scaling exponent is to make a perturbative analysis of critical solution .",
    "similarity to roberts solution suggests that the results for four dimensional spacetime @xcite can be applied to higher dimensions as well .",
    "in this section we consider several particular cases for which the general solution ( [ eq : soln ] ) is simplified . particularly important is @xmath70 case , which is the already familiar roberts solution .",
    "as we have already mentioned , for @xmath36 the only self - similar scalar field solution of the form ( [ eq : soln : metric ] ) is trivial . to see it , note that equation ( [ eq : soln : eqn : r ] ) implies that @xmath71 if @xmath36 , and so @xmath72 and @xmath73 . from equation ( [ eq : soln : eqn : r ] )",

    "however , integrals corresponding to critical solutions simplify , and can be taken in terms of elementary functions for @xmath90 .",
    "it happens because potential factors since it has second order zero , therefore reducing the power of @xmath46 in the radical by two .",
    "the results of integration for critical solutions are @xmath91 the dependence @xmath89 is still given implicitly .",
    "the critical value of the parameter @xmath92 is @xmath93 for @xmath94 , and @xmath95 for @xmath96 .      for higher dimensions , integral ( [ eq : soln ] )",
    "can not be taken in terms of elementary functions , so one has to be content with the solution in the integral - implicit form , or do numerical calculations .",
    "in this section we discuss in detail how solutions of minimally coupled scalar field model can be generalized to much wider class of couplings . the fact that essentially all couplings of a free scalar field to its kinetic term and scalar curvature are equivalent has been used in the past @xcite to study scalar field models with non - minimal coupling .",
    "in particular , this idea has been applied to extend four - dimensional roberts solution to conformal coupling and brans - dicke theory @xcite .",
