    "minimal surfaces in the euclidean space @xmath4 are fundamental forms in nature , mathematics and physics in particular  @xcite . their elegant shape is due to the local minimum area property which yields zero mean curvature everywhere .",
    "one special class of surfaces arises by experimenting with the soap bubbles framed between two or more jordan curves  @xcite .",
    "for example , the minimal surface joining two coaxial circles in parallel planes has the shape of a catenoid , a configuration that is extremal for numerous problems  @xcite .",
    "theorem  [ mods ] in the present paper shows that catenoid has also the largest conformal modulus among minimal graphs over a given annulus .",
    "an open doubly - connected surface @xmath5 in @xmath4 is a conformal image of either    * punctured complex plane @xmath6 * punctured disk @xmath7 * or an annulus @xmath8 , @xmath9    in this latter case the _ conformal modulus _ of @xmath10 is defined by @xmath11    note that the ratio @xmath12 is independent of the choice of the conformal mapping , say @xmath13 .",
    "this is immediate from the classical result of schottky  @xcite , 1877 .",
    "let us first establish the notation of two circular annuli in the complex plane that will remain standard throughout this paper    @xmath14     + a theorem of schottky asserts that :    [ schottky ] there exists a conformal homeomorphism @xmath15 if and only if the annuli have the same modulus ; that is , @xmath16 moreover , up to the rotation of the annuli , every such map takes the form + @xmath17    we shall later devote section  [ sec3.1 ] to a fresh proof of schottky s theorem .",
    "it is this proof that reveals the novelty of our approach and , to some extent , leads to computational advances needed for harmonic mappings of annuli .",
    "the coordinate functions @xmath18 in the conformal representation of a surface , called _ isothermal parameters _ , satisfy the cauchy - riemann system :    @xmath19    throughout this paper we take advantage of the complex variable @xmath20 and the two wirtinger differential operators @xmath21 in this notation the cauchy - riemann system takes the form of one complex equation @xmath22 now , the surface is minimal if and only if the isothermal parameters are harmonic or , equivalently , the complex vector field @xmath23 is holomorphic ; that is , @xmath24 let us factor the ambience of the surface into the complex plane and the real line @xmath25",
    ". thus @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a complex harmonic map .",
    "a simple direct computation shows that @xmath28 hence , all zeros of the holomorphic function @xmath29 must have even order .",
    "this allows us to determine the third isothermal parameter in terms of @xmath30 @xmath31 it is evident that every complex harmonic map @xmath32 , for which @xmath29 admits a continuous branch of square root , can be lifted to the isothermal parameters of a minimal surface .",
    "the surface is flat ; that is , @xmath33 , if and only if @xmath30 is holomorphic ( orientation preserving ) or antiholomorphic ( orientation reversing ) .",
    "let us consider now the case in which @xmath34 is a minimal graph over an annulus @xmath35 .",
    "thus @xmath36 is a harmonic homeomorphism . without losing any generality",
    "we can assume that @xmath30 preserves the orientation .",
    "this yields an elliptic beltrami type equation for @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 exists as a single valued analytic branch in @xmath40 .",
    "our basic example of this is an upper slab of a catenoid furnished by the parameters : @xmath41 this is a minimal graph over the annulus",
    "@xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 note that the width of the slab @xmath45 , distance from the base circle to the top one , equals its conformal modulus , @xmath46 suppose we are now given two frames ( jordan curves ) to be used to create a soap bubble of a doubly connected minimal surface . generally speaking , when these frames are moved farther apart , the conformal modulus of a surface increases and there is a moment when the bubble brakes down .",
    "the critical upper bound of the conformal modulus for which the minimal graph exists is the essence of the nitsche conjecture , which is now one of our results .",
    "[ mods ] let @xmath10 be a minimal graph over the annulus @xmath47 , then @xmath48 equality occurs if and only if @xmath49 is the upper slab of a catenoid .        in 1962 j.c.c .",
    "nitsche announced , in a short article  @xcite , that the existence of a harmonic homeomorphism @xmath50 , whether or not it comes from a minimal graph , yields a lower bound on @xmath51 in terms of @xmath52 .",
    "he conjectured that the necessary and sufficient condition for such a mapping to exist is the following inequality , now known as the _ nitsche bound _",
    "@xmath53 subsequently , his conjecture appeared in monographs  @xcite , @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "21.3.2 ) and surveys  @xcite .",
    "various lower bounds for @xmath54 have been obtained by lyzzaik  @xcite , weitsman  @xcite , kalaj  @xcite , and by nitsche himself ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "worth noting is lyzzaik s bound in  @xcite that exhibits linear growth of @xmath55 as the ratio @xmath56 approaches infinity .",
    "however , none of these results came close to  . here",
    "we prove this inequality , in somewhat greater generality , which obviously implies theorem  [ mods ] .",
    "one should note in advance that whenever @xmath50 is a homeomorphism , the function @xmath57 extends continuously up to the boundary of  @xmath58 .",
    "moreover , there are two possibilities ; either @xmath59 or the other way round @xmath60 in the former case , we say that @xmath30 is consistent with the order of boundary components .",
    "we also have two additional possibilities depending on whether @xmath30 preserves or reverses the orientation .",
    "accordingly , there are four homotopy classes of homeomorphisms between annuli . without loss of generality",
    "we shall confine ourselves to studying the class @xmath61 the following notation will represent harmonic mappings in this class , @xmath62    our preeminent result , though not the most general , is :    [ th1](existence of harmonic maps ) the annuli @xmath63 and @xmath47 admit a harmonic homeomorphism @xmath64 if and only if @xmath3 when equality occurs , then every @xmath65 takes the form @xmath66    various geometric and analytic properties of harmonic mappings are discussed , e.g. , in the books  @xcite and articles  @xcite .",
    "there are notable recent studies  @xcite that also concluded with the nitsche bound in  , though from a slightly different framework .",
    "this is the framework of the dirichlet energy @xmath67=",
    "\\iint_{\\mathbb{a}}{\\lvertdh\\rvert}^2 = 2 \\iint_{\\mathbb{a}}\\left({\\lverth_z\\rvert}^2 + { \\lverth_{\\bar z}\\rvert}^2\\right)\\ ] ] in general , minimizing the energy among homeomorphisms need not lead to the laplace equation .",
    "the reason is that passing to the weak limit of a minimizing sequence of homeomorphisms in @xmath68 may result in a noninjective mapping .",
    "harmonicity is lost exactly at the branch points near which the extremal mapping fails to be injective . outside the branch",
    "set the extremal mappings are indeed harmonic .",
    "this latter fact follows from rad - kneser - choquet theorem @xcite .",
    "the above recent studies of the minima of the dirichlet energy can be encapsulated as :    the class @xmath69 of homeomorphisms @xmath64 admits an energy minimizer if and only if @xmath3 all minimizers are harmonic , in symbols : @xmath70 moreover , modulo rotation , they take the form @xmath71    note that the necessary condition is immediate from theorem  [ th1 ] , though it was first established in  @xcite by completely different idea ( the method of free lagrangians ) .",
    "indeed , beyond the nitsche bound there is no homeomorphism minimizing the energy because otherwise it would be a harmonic map , by rad - kneser - choquet theorem @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to know what happens beyond the inner boundary of @xmath72 . for simplicity",
    ", suppose that @xmath73 so in the critical configuration we have @xmath74 .",
    "the nitsche map @xmath75 , so extended to the annulus @xmath76 , becomes a harmonic double cover of @xmath77 .",
    "folding takes place along the unit circle where the jacobian vanishes . on the other hand ,",
    "passing to a weak limit of a minimizing sequence of homeomorphisms @xmath78 results in squeezing the inner portion @xmath79 of the annulus @xmath80 onto the unit circle .",
    "the minimizer , found in  @xcite , is unique modulo rotation and takes the form :    @xmath81    the critical nitsche map @xmath75 , extended harmonically beyond the unit circle and furnished with the vertical isothermal coordinate @xmath82 for @xmath83 , gives rise to a symmetric slab of the catenoid .",
    "this result strongly suggests nonexistence of any harmonic homeomorphism @xmath78 .",
    "but _  priori _ , there might exist harmonic homeomorphisms which do not minimize the energy . to show that this is not the case we found that the integral means @xmath84 over the circles @xmath85 are better suited than the energy integrals .",
    "it should be observed that harmonicity of a function @xmath86 is invariant under conformal change of the @xmath87-variable .",
    "therefore , the nitsche bound remains valid for harmonic homeomorphisms defined on any doubly connected domain whose conformal modulus coincides with that of @xmath58 .",
    "it is therefore of interest to look at the role of the boundary curves in the target annulus as well .",
    "although we need the inner boundary of the target to be a circle , the circular shape of the outer boundary turns out to be inessential , there remains a substitute of the nitsche bound in terms of the integral means @xmath88 . in our generalized form of the nitsche bound",
    "the target will be a half circular annulus ; that is , a doubly connected domain , denoted by @xmath89 , whose inner boundary is a circle @xmath90 .",
    "we do not specify the outer boundary of @xmath89 as it can be arbitrary .",
    "let @xmath91 denote the class of orientation preserving harmonic homeomorphisms @xmath92 which preserve the order of the boundary components .",
    "in particular , @xmath93 .        [ th2 ]",
    "( generalized nitsche bound ) for every @xmath94 we have @xmath95^\\frac{1}{2 } \\ge \\frac{1}{2 } \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}+ \\frac{r}{\\sigma}\\right)r_\\ast\\ ; , \\quad r \\le",
    "\\sigma < r\\ ] ] if equality occurs at some radius @xmath96 , then it holds for every @xmath97 and @xmath98 for some @xmath99 .",
    "such a more general statement not only strengthens the nitsche conjecture , but also is the key to the proof .",
    "theorem  [ th2 ] should be viewed as a sharp lower estimate for the growth of integral means of harmonic mappings under certain initial constraints .",
    "these constraints concern topological behavior of @xmath30 near the inner boundary @xmath100 rather than its boundary values .",
    "it causes no loss of generality to assume that @xmath30 is smooth up to the inner boundary ; we shall reduce ourselves to smooth mappings via lemma  [ lemappr ] .",
    "what one really needs for smooth mapping @xmath101 is its harmonicity in @xmath102 and the following three initial conditions : +    a.   [ in1 ] @xmath103 is a homeomorphism homotopic to the identity ; b.   [ in2 ] @xmath104 at @xmath105 ; c.   [ in3 ] @xmath106 .",
    "in fact these three conditions yield inequality  .",
    "even more , it turns out that condition   is redundant when @xmath107 .",
    "the proof of this case of theorem  [ th2 ] is based upon the ideas from our earlier paper  @xcite .",
    "however , example  [ ex ] demonstrates that constraints   are insufficient to deduce inequality   when @xmath52 is large .",
    "a new approach is required in which we make use of the jacobian bound  .",
    "the key ingredient is the following result concerning harmonic self - mappings of the unit disk , which is interesting in its own right .",
    "[ th3 ] let a harmonic homeomorphism @xmath108 be @xmath109-smooth in the closed unit disk @xmath110 . then @xmath111 the first inequality is strict unless @xmath112 is an isometry .",
    "we end this overview by stating an analogue of nitsche s conjecture for noninjective harmonic maps , which has geometric interpretation for more general doubly connected minimal surfaces , not necessarily graphs .",
    "let @xmath113 be a harmonic map ( not necessarily injective ) with nonzero winding number ; that is , @xmath114 then @xmath115 equality occurs for the double cover nitsche map : @xmath116    the solution of the nitsche conjecture and the methods presented here open new questions yet to be answered .",
    "the annuli @xmath58 and @xmath117 as well as the half circular annulus @xmath89 will henceforth be rescaled so their inner boundaries are the unit circles , still denoted by @xmath118 whenever the target of @xmath119 need not be specified we abbreviate this notation to @xmath120 .",
    "thus , from now on @xmath121    the complex derivatives @xmath122 and @xmath123 in polar coordinates are : @xmath124 hence one finds the hilbert - schmidt norm of the differential matrix @xmath125 the laplacian @xmath126 and the jacobian determinant @xmath127 we shall work with a number of circular means to which the following commutation rule will apply @xmath128 the main objects are the circular means of @xmath129 for mappings @xmath120 , @xmath130 we shall also discuss so - called mean radius of @xmath131 defined by the rule : @xmath132 here , as usual , dot over @xmath133 and @xmath134 stands for the @xmath135-derivative .",
    "thus , we aim to prove the inequality @xmath136 next observe that away from the outer boundary of @xmath137 the energy of @xmath120 is always finite .",
    "the proof is an exercise with green s formula ; first we have for @xmath138 @xmath139 hence we infer that @xmath140 is strictly increasing and then @xmath141 now the following limit is easily seen to exist for @xmath142 : @xmath143    the so defined quantity @xmath144 is called the _ initial speed _ , it represents the initial data of _ harmonic evolution of circles _ under the mapping @xmath101 .",
    "we just found that the initial speed is always nonnegative for @xmath145 ; later in proposition [ schii ] we shall see that it equals 1 for conformal mappings .",

    "<S> the nitsche conjecture is deeply rooted in the theory of doubly connected minimal surfaces . however , it is commonly formulated in slightly greater generality as a question of existence of a harmonic homeomorphism between circular annuli @xmath0 in the early 1960s , while attempting to describe all doubly connected minimal graphs over a given annulus @xmath1 , j.c.c . </S>",
    "<S> nitsche observed that their conformal modulus can not be too large . </S>",
