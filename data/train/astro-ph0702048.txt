    "there is wide consensus that active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , x - ray binaries , etc . , are powered by accretion flows on to compact relativistic objects , most often a black hole ( bh ) .",
    "a well - known model of such accretion flows is the standard - disk model proposed by shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) , which has been used to explain a variety of observations of agns and x - ray binaries .",
    "recently , it has been recognized that observations of many objects can not be explained by the standard - disk model .",
    "for instance , this model can not produce the very high temperature ( @xmath0 k ) and broad - band spectrum ( extending from @xmath1 to @xmath2 hz ) observed in the galactic center source sgr a@xmath3 and in x - ray binaries in the hard state .",
    "this has led to the idea of an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf , narayan & yi 1995 , abramowicz et al .",
    "1995  ) , which is also called a radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) .",

    "the disk becomes optically very thick and as a result photons are partially trapped inside the accreting gas .",
    "this is the regime of interest to us .",
    "photon - trapping is important at any radius where the accretion time scale is longer than the photon diffusion time scale from the disk midplane to the surface ( begelman 1978 ) .",
    "the photons produced in this region of the disk are advected into the central bh and are unable to escape from the flow .",
    "begelman considered only spherically symmetric accretion , but it is recognized that photon - trapping is important even for systems with a disk geometry .",
    "photon - trapping has been included approximately in the so - called `` slim disk model '' proposed by abramowicz , igumenshchev & lasota ( 1998 ) , and in recent calculations by szuszkiewicz et al .",

    "however , these studies do not model the effect fully since they consider vertically integrated quantities in the disk and reduce the problem to a one - dimensional model . full two - dimensional radiation - hydrodynamical simulations ( 2d - rhd ) were done for the first time by one of the current authors in ohsuga et al .",

    "a realistic model of supercritical accretion must include the following two effects : i ) even at disk radii inside the trapping radius , photons that are emitted near the surface of the disk can escape , though most of the photons emitted deeper inside are advected into the bh .",
    "ii ) the vertical profiles of various quantities in the disk such as density , optical depth , etc . , play a critical role in determining what fraction of the photons escape , and thereby influence the total luminosity of the disk .",
