    "stochastic search problems occur in many fields of science as well as in daily life . the quest for an optimal strategy for locating a target whether inanimate ( such as a binding site for a protein at the molecular level @xcite or an element in a list ) or living ( such as a prey for a predator @xcite ) has been the source of a large number of different algorithms that combine observation , physical mechanisms and computation .",
    "depending on the context , search strategies can be very different , leading to a variety of interesting models ( see the special issue @xcite devoted to this field of research ) .",
    "one robust class of models called _ intermittent target search strategies _ combine phases of slow motion , that allow target detection , and phases of fast motion , during which the searcher relocates but is not reactive ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "such strategies have been observed at different scales : foraging animals , such as humming birds or bumblebees , display intermittent search patterns @xcite .",
    "the e. coli bacteria alternates ballistic moves ( or ` runs ' ) with random changes of direction ( ` tumbles ' ) in order to reach regions with high concentration of a chemo - attractant ( chemotactic search ) @xcite .",
    "a protein efficiently localizes a specific dna sequence by alternating 1d sliding phases with free 3d diffusion ( ` relocation phases ' ) : this mechanism of ` facilitated diffusion ' , first proposed by adam and delbrck @xcite , enhances the association rate by two orders of magnitude as compared to the diffusion limit and leads to numerical values that agree quantitatively with experimental results @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "a simple model of diffusion with stochastic resetting , in which a brownian particle is stochastically reset to its initial position with a constant rate @xmath0 was defined and studied in @xcite .",
    "the stationary state of this process is a non - gaussian distribution and violates detailed - balance : a non - vanishing steady - state current is directed towards the resetting position .",
    "this process can be viewed as an elementary model of an intermittent strategy in which the searcher , having explored its environment unsuccessfully for a while , returns to its initial position and begins a new search .",
    "it was also shown in @xcite that there exists an optimal resetting rate @xmath1 that minimizes the average hitting time to the target .",
    "extensions to space depending rate , resetting to an random position with a given distribution and to a spatial distribution of the target were considered in  @xcite .",
    "the effect of resetting was previously studied in a stochastic multiplicative model of population growth where stochastic resetting events of the population size was shown to lead to a stationary power - law distributed population size distribution  @xcite .",
    "a continuous - time random walk model in the presence of a drift and resetting has also been studied recently  @xcite . finally , in the context of search process , a related model has been studied by gelenbe  @xcite where searchers are introduced stochastically into the system : there is a single searcher present at a given time with a random lifetime and when the searcher dies , a new searcher is introduced into the system at the initial starting point .    in the mathematics literature , mean first - passage time for a class of random walks with stochastic restarting events has been studied recently from an algorithmic point of view  @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we focus on the simple continuous - time brownian diffusion model with a nonzero resetting rate introduced in  @xcite and compare quantitatively the reset dynamics with the equilibrium langevin process that leads to the same stationary distribution .",
    "we prove analytically that the non - equilibrium process is more efficient than the equilibrium one by showing that the optimal mean - first passage time is smaller in the former case .",
    "we extend our study to the multiparticle problem by considering a team of searchers uniformly distributed on the line and looking for an immobile target .",
    "we show that both the average survival probability and the typical survival probability of the non - equilibrium process are smaller than the corresponding quantities for the equilibrium dynamics .",
    "this shows that , at least for this model for which exact analytical calculations can be performed , the non - equilibrium strategy systematically defeats the equilibrium behaviour .",
    "the outline of this work is as follows . in section  [ sec : rv ] , we review the diffusion model with resetting and some of its basic properties , including survival probability and first - passage time .",
    "an effective equilibrium dynamics with the same stationary distribution is defined in section  [ sec : langevin ] and it is shown that the optimal mean first - passage time associated with that dynamics is always larger than the optimal time if resetting is allowed . in section  [ sec : multipart ] , we investigate the survival probability of a single target in presence of a team of independent searchers .",
    "average and typical survival probabilities display drastically different behaviours ( algebraic vs exponential decay with time ) both for the nonequilibrium and equilibrium processes .",
    "nevertheless , it is shown that nonequilibrium dynamics is systematically more efficient .",
    "the last section is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , we recall the definition of the model of diffusion with stochastic resetting and briefly review some basic results , derived in @xcite .    we consider a single particle on an infinite line starting at the initial position @xmath2 at @xmath3 . the position of the particle at time @xmath4 is updated in a small time interval @xmath5 by the following stochastic rule  @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a gaussian white noise with mean @xmath8 and the two point correlator @xmath9 .",
    "the dynamics thus consists of a stochastic mixture of resetting to the initial position with rate @xmath0 ( long range move ) and ordinary diffusion ( short range move ) with diffusion constant @xmath10 ( see fig .",

    "we emphasize that the dynamics violates detailed balance manifestly : the current from a position @xmath15 to @xmath2 via the resetting move is not compensated by a current from @xmath2 to @xmath15 .",
    "the fokker - planck equation  ( [ fp1 ] ) admits a stationary solution in the @xmath16 limit , given by @xmath17\\quad { \\rm where}\\,\\ , \\alpha_0= \\sqrt{r / d}\\;. \\label{st.1}\\ ] ] even though the stationary solution can be expressed as an effective boltzmann weight : @xmath18 $ ] with the effective potential @xmath19 , one should keep in mind that this is actually a _ nonequilibrium stationary state _ , and not an equilibrium stationary state .",
    "indeed , in this stationary state detailed balance is violated by a nonzero current in the configuration space . had the stationary state been an equilibrium one , the current would have exactly vanished .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the additional resetting parameter @xmath0 allows us to tune the target search process to make it more efficient .",
