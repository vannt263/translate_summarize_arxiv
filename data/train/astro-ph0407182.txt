    "it has long been recognized that direct imaging of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) can provide important constraints on their physical parameters @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the characteristic size of a grb image is only of order a micro - arcsecond about a day after the grb at the hubble distance , and so it can not be resolved by existing telescopes .",
    "nevertheless , indirect constraints on the image size of grb afterglows were derived based on the transition between diffractive and refractive scintillations @xcite in the radio afterglow of grb 970508 @xcite , and based on microlensing by a star in a foreground galaxy @xcite for the optical lightcurve of grb 000301c @xcite .",
    "obviously the challenge of imaging a grb is made easier for nearby sources where the late radio afterglow extends over a wide , possibly resolvable angle @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite have used a vlbi campaign to measure , for the first time , the angular size and proper motion of the radio afterglow image of the bright , nearby ( @xmath0 ) grb 030329 .",
    "the diameter of the afterglow image was observed to be @xmath1mas ( 0.2 pc ) after 25 days and @xmath2mas ( @xmath3pc ) after 83 days , indicating an average velocity of @xmath4c .",
    "this superluminal expansion is consistent with expectations of the standard relativistic jet model @xcite .",
    "the projected proper motion of grb 030329 was measured to be smaller than 0.3 mas for 80 days following the grb .",
    "here we use the data of @xcite to constrain the physical parameters of grb 030329 based on detailed modelling of the collimated relativistic hydrodynamics of grb afterglows . since the current state - of - the - art modelling of afterglow jets is still flawed with uncertainties @xcite , we use this data to critically assess some classes of models that were proposed in the literature .",
    "an important difference between relativistic radio jets of grbs and the better - studied relativistic radio jets of quasars @xcite or micro - quasars @xcite is that active quasars often inject energy over extended periods of time into the jet while grb sources are impulsive .",
    "although quasar jets remain highly collimated throughout their lifetimes , grb jets decelerate and expand significantly once they become non - relativistic , @xmath5yr after the explosion .",
    "the hydrodynamic remnant of a grb eventually becomes nearly spherical only after @xmath6yr @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in  [ self_abs ] , we discuss the expected image size of radio afterglows and its relation to the observed flux density below the self absorption frequency . in  [ temp_ev ] , we analyze the expected temporal evolution of the afterglow image size .",
    "the expected linear polarization is discussed in  [ pol ] , while the surface brightness profile across the image and its effects on the estimated source size are considered in  [ sb ] .",
    "finally , we apply these derivations to the radio data of grb 030329 (  [ application ] ) and infer the physical parameters from the measured spectrum (  [ phys_par ] ) .",
    "we conclude in  [ dis ] with a discussion of our primary results and their implications .",

    "is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the fraction of the internal energy behind the shock in relativistic electrons , and @xmath12 is the bulk lorentz factor of the shocked fluid . there is a spectral break at @xmath13 , the synchrotron frequency of electrons with @xmath14 .",
    "another break in the spectrum occurs at @xmath15 , the synchrotron frequency of an electron that cools on the dynamical time .    at sufficiently low frequencies , below the self absorption frequency @xmath16 ,",
    "the optical depth to synchrotron self absorption @xmath17 becomes larger than unity , causing an additional break in the spectrum . in this spectral range ,",
    "the emitted intensity is given by the rayleigh - jeans part of a black body spectrum , where the black body temperature is taken as the effective temperature @xmath18 of the electrons that are emitting the radiation at the observed frequency @xmath19 .",
    "in the local rest frame of the emitting fluid this may be written as @xmath20 where primed quantities are measured in the local rest frame of the emitting fluid while un - primed quantities are measured in the observer frame ( the rest frame of the central source ) . when @xmath21 , the emission at @xmath22 is dominated by electrons for which @xmath23 , giving @xmath24 and @xmath25 . for @xmath26",
    "there is rapid cooling and all the electrons cool significantly within a dynamical time @xcite .",

    "an electron with an initial lorentz factor @xmath34 does not have enough time to cool significantly after crossing the shock .",

    "@xmath49 is the radius of the observed image ( its apparent size on the plane of the sky ) and @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the angular , proper and luminosity distances to the source , respectively .",

    "this is equivalent to choosing an effective value of @xmath12 .",

    "the equal arrival time surface is the surface from where photons that are emitted at the shock front arrive to the the observer simultaneously .",
    "since the emission originates only from behind the shock front , the projection of the equal arrival time surface onto the plane of the sky ( i.e. the plane perpendicular to the line - of - sight ) determines the boundaries of the observed image , and its apparent size ( see figure [ image_size ] ) . for a spherical shock front with any @xmath67 , @xmath66 is located at an angle @xmath68 which satisfies @xmath69 ( see appendix [ theta _ * ] ) , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the velocity ( in units of @xmath72 ) and the lorentz factor of the shock front or @xmath73 for the location of the emitting fluid , which is always just behind the shock .",

    "this changes the overall normalization of the polarization light curve , and hardly affects its shape @xcite .",
    "since the overall normalization is the most pronounced difference between slow and fast lateral expansion , and it is very similar to the effect of the degree of anisotropy of the magnetic field behind the shock , it would be very hard to constrain the degree of lateral expansion from the polarization light curves .",
