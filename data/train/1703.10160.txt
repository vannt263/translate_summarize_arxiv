    "furthermore , there is a cp - violating rate asymmetry which is generated through the interference between @xmath18@xmath23 mixing and decay processes @xcite .",
    "it would be very interesting to measure this observable .",
    "however , such an analysis requires tagging information on the decaying @xmath22 meson , thereby making it more challenging than the untagged effective lifetime measurement .    in the sm ,",
    "the key difference of @xmath17 with respect to @xmath2 and @xmath3 is due to the different lepton masses . in the case of the former decay",
