    "the perturbation theory ( pth ) expansion in qcd is an extremely useful tool , which has provided numerous links between theory and experiment [ 1 ] .",
    "the physical foundation of pth in qcd is the celebrated asymptotic freedom phenomenon [ 2 ] , ensuring the smallness of the physical coupling constant @xmath1 at large momenta ( small distances ) .",
    "a formal extrapolation of the lowest order ( one - loop ) expressions for the renormalized @xmath1 to large distances ( small momenta ) is known to be plagued by the ghost pole , which signals an uncontrolled growth of the strength of interaction at large distances .",
    "it is believed that pth expansion breaks down even before the landau ghost pole is reached , so that the latter has no physical meaning , similarly to the case of qed [ 3,4 ] .",
    "the impossibility of treating large distances in pth of qcd strongly limits applications of qcd and from the formal point of view signifies the incompleteness of the theory .",
    "the logarithmic growth of the renormalized @xmath1 at large distances leads also to a basic difficulty , which is known as the infrared ( ir ) renormalon problem [ 5 ] .",
    "the ir renormalons appear as singularities on the positive real axis of the borel parameter and destroy an attempt to sum up the pht series .",
    "thus the consistency of the pht approach is seriously in doubt , when one expands around the free unperturbed vacuum .",
    "alternatively it was understood during the last decades , that nonperturbative ( np ) contributions are very important at large distances . in the framework of the qcd sum rules [ 6 ]",
    "the np contributions haven been parametrized as local field vacuum averages using the operator product expansion ( ope ) [ 7 ] .",
    "the phenomenologically found characteristics of the qcd vacuum clearly demonstrate that the np fields in the vacuum are large ( as compared to @xmath2 ) .",
    "e.g. the gluonic condensate @xmath3 [ 6 ] ; lattice calculations yield even larger values [ 8 ] .    the np effects coded as power corrections in ope [ 6 ] crucially change the behavior of the ope series ( as compared to the pth series ) when one is leaving the asymptotic freedom region and approaching large distances . to quote the seminal paper [ 6 ] : `` the basic idea behind all applications is that it is the power terms ( not higher orders in the @xmath1 series ) that limit asymptotic freedom , if one tries to extend the short - distance approach to larger distances '' .",
    "it is specific to the local ope , that power terms explode at large distances , demonstrating the importance of the np effects but also the difficulty of the method to penetrate the region beyond the confinement radius .    in this paper",
    "we propose to make a step forward in our strategy and instead of expansion in local condensates to consider from the beginning the pth in the np background of a general form .",
    "the framework for this exists for a long time [ 9 - 11 ] .",
    "gluonic field is split into the background @xmath4 and perturbative gluon field @xmath5 and the new pth is roughly an expansion in powers of @xmath6 .",
    "the propagators of @xmath5 are exact green s functions @xmath7 in the background field @xmath4 .",
    "a new element , crucial for the method , is that we are using a closed form for @xmath7 based on the so - called feynman - schwinger representation ( fsr ) [ 12 ] .",
    "this allows to display explicit dependence on @xmath4 , which enters through the parallel transporters @xmath8 . in the limit of large @xmath9 any term of",
    "the new perturbative series contains @xmath4 through the wilson loops @xmath10 . averaging over an ensemble of background fields",
    "@xmath11 then reduces the graph to a product of averaged wilson loops if @xmath12 , and all the nonperturbative series is unambigiously defined by the expression for the averaged wilson loop @xmath13 . at large distances",
    "the latter obeys the area law [ 13 ] , and one obtains therefore a one - parameter description of np dynamics in the new perturbation series .    as a result one obtains a gauge - invariant pth ,",
    "even though the background gauge fixing term is used in the lagrangian together with faddeev - popov ghosts [ 14 ] .",
    "it is not a purpose of this paper to formulate feynman rules for diagrams of the new pth and to study systematically the renormalization procedure in the case of the np background .",
    "instead we concentrate here on the lowest one - loop contribution to the charge renormalization . in this way we attempt to answer the question : how the asymptotic freedom ( af ) behaviour of @xmath1 , which is generated by the lowest gluon and ghost corrections in the background field , is maintained and how background parameters enter into the final expression for @xmath1 .    to do that one first",
    "must define the charge renormalization in a gauge - invariant and np nonlocal formulation .",
    "we propose 3 definitions and two of them study quantitatively .",
    "we find that the np background fields change the renormalized charge in a drastic way for small momenta ( large distances ) .",
    "the usual logarithmic growth of @xmath14 at large distances in the one - loop approximation disappears and @xmath14 saturates instead at rather moderate values . the mass scale @xmath15 ( or distance @xmath16 ) which governs this change of asymptotics is large , @xmath17 , and physically is connected to the hybrid mass  or in the string terms  to the excitation mass of the transverse string vibration , @xmath18 .    as a result",
    "the asymptotic freedom can be kept at any distances in the euclidean space and expresses itself as a saturation of @xmath1 at @xmath19 .",
    "we always use eucledian metrics and do not analytically continue perturbative expansions into the minkowskian region , where physical thresholds appears .",
    "this will be a topic of separate publication .",
    "this property drastically changes the problem of the summation of the pth series .",
    "we show that the ir renormalons do not appear in the background field , and the corresponding set of graphs has a finite sum .",
    "hence the only obstacle left is instantons ( instanton - antiinstanton pairs ) , which require an explicit treatment .",
    "we stress that it not the purpose of our method to suggest an explicit way of splitting the fields into the background and perturbative ones .",
    "instead we choose from the beginning the np background fields , they are considered as given and this input is parametrized , e.g. by the full set of correlators @xmath20 .",
    "the problem one has to solve in this case is how to find the perturbative series in this background , and we attempt to do it in the paper .",
    "happily it appears that at large distances the only characteristics of the background which enters the answer is the string tension , and we take it to have the known phenomenological value .    the plan of the paper is as follows in section 2 we introduce background field lagrangian , gauge - fixing and ghost terms following the usual prescriptions [ 9 - 11 ] and write explicitly the gluon propagator . in section 3 three definitions of the running coupling are compared , and in section 4 one of it  defined through the energy of static quarks , is studied in detail .",
    "another definition , yielding the running coupling @xmath21 in the momentum space , is discussed in section 5 .",
    "section 6 is devoted to the renormalons and the problem of summation of the perturbative series .    in the conclusion",
    "we summarize results of the paper anl outline possible future developments .",
    "three appendices devoted to the explicit derivations of formulas used or discussed in the text . in appendix 1",
    "we consider the contribution of the term @xmath22 , which directly connects np background and the perturbative field @xmath5 , to the propagator of @xmath23 .",
    "appendix 2 contains some detailes of derivation of the renormalization @xmath14 using the wilson - loop approach .",
    "appendix 3 contains a detailed disscussion of the one - loop graph in presence of the confining background ; most of the results used in the main text are based on the formulas explicitly derived there .    in appendix 4",
    "we treat the gluon spin part of the gluon propagator in the background field .",

    "we split the gluonic field @xmath23 into the background @xmath4 and perturbative part @xmath5 @xmath24    as we stressed in the introduction we do not specify any principle of this division . for the purposes of the paper the exact properties of separation are immaterial , and we shall only assume that the np fields @xmath4 ensure the area low of the wilson loop @xmath25 with roughly the same string tension @xmath26 as known phenomenologically , @xmath27 .",
    "to develope the pth in the background field @xmath4 we use the well established background field formalism [ 9 - 11 ] , specifically we extensively use method and notations of the paper [ 11 ] , adjusted to the euclidean space - time .",

    "we again stress at this point , that in our approach there is no problem of separation of a given @xmath45 into @xmath48 and a pth piece ( which is of course not well defined ) .",
    "instead we assume that an ensemble of fields @xmath68 is given to us , it is characterized by correlators @xmath69 and in particular by the string tension @xmath26 , which can be expressed through the correlators .",

    "one can approximate @xmath225 as @xmath226 which after renormalization yields the fourier - transform @xmath227    a comparison of ( 59 ) and ( 63 ) shows that up to power corrections two expressions have the same @xmath59 dependence , and hence the same @xmath136 factors .",
    "actually all the change from ( 59 ) to ( 63 ) can be described as introduction of a new ( fifth ) external momentum component @xmath228 , so that the total momentum squared is in case of nonperturbative background equal to @xmath229 .",

    "this logarithm is still large for @xmath240 if one chooses a low normalization parameter @xmath235,@xmath241 .",
    "thus the @xmath239 phenomenon can be maintained down to very low @xmath43 in the euclidean region .",

    "currents @xmath246 as in [ 29 , 30 ] and shall write it as in [ 30 ] in a form exhibiting the contribution of the renormalon [ 5 ] @xmath247 where we have separated out of the pth series the contribution of the set of diagrams shown in fig .",

    "we shall first discuss the infrared ( @xmath245 ) renormalon , [ 5 ] , i.e. the contribution from the graphs of fig.17 from the domain of integration over @xmath249 with @xmath250 .",
    "if the coupling constant @xmath1 is normalized at @xmath251 ( we shall take it at @xmath252 and ( 66 ) is used for @xmath1 , we have @xmath253    the analysis of the integral ( 68 ) made in the appendix 5 , yields    @xmath254    with the notation @xmath255 .    as a result",
    "we obtain the following contribution of the graphs in fig.17 @xmath256 where @xmath257    we remind that the estimate ( 71 ) is an upper limit for @xmath258 .",
    "first we discuss a connection with the previous results [ 29,30 ] on the ir renormalons . in this case",
    "@xmath259 ( no background field ) and @xmath260 is defined as in ( 71 ) for any @xmath107 and the borel transform of @xmath261 is as in [ 29,30 ] @xmath262 the borel integral ( 72 ) exibits ir renormalon pole at @xmath263 which makes the borel summation of the pth series prohibitive .    in our case , when @xmath264 is finite , the situation is drastically changed .",
    "namely , having in mind that the estimate ( 71 ) is an upper limit of @xmath258 both for @xmath265 and for @xmath266 , we can take the sum in ( 70 ) which does not diverge and even does not need borelization . leaving details for the appendix 5 we quote only the final result @xmath267 there are no poles in the plane of the borel variable , as can be easily seen from the absense of the factorial growth of the coefficient @xmath258 at arbitrarily large @xmath107 .",
    "we thus conclude that the convergence of pth series is radically improved when the strong nonperturbative background is taken into account , and in particular the ir renormalons disappear .",
    "we now turn to the ultraviolet ( uv ) renormalons [ 5 ] .",
    "those come from the same series of graphs , fig.17 , but from the integration region with @xmath268 .",
    "it is easy to understand that the uv renormalons do not change due to the modified af logarithm ( 66 ) , since in this kinematical region @xmath269 and the change is immaterial .",
    "hence we have as in [ 30 ] the estimate @xmath270 which brings a pole at negative value of the borel parameter , @xmath271 , and hence the borel sum of the pth series is well defined .",
    "we have introduced in this paper a new perturbation theory , based on the explicit separation of @xmath49 and perturbative fields , eq.(1 ) .",
    "two different @xmath49 definitions of the running coupling constant are used , eqs.(9,13 ) and ( 19 ) , and in both cases the one - loop contribution is shown to be bounded at large distances , in contrast to the logarithmic growth of the free one - loop result .",
    "it is important that gell - mann - low equations are not changed and the resulting behaviour of @xmath21 is characterized by only one new parameter , @xmath272 as in ( 65 - 66 ) , which is rg invariant .",
    "the mass @xmath15 depends on the process and in the typical situation of a gluon exchange in the @xmath273 annihilation , is of the order of one gev . as a result",
    "the magnitude of @xmath21 everywhere in the euclidean region of @xmath237 is limited and the landau ghost pole is not inevitable .",
    "rough estimates show that @xmath21 is less than unity in the euclidean region ; enabling one to use perturbation expansion at all distances .    as a consequence",
    "there appears a solution of the long standing problem of ir renormalons .",
    "it is shown in section 6 , that ir renormalons are absent when the running coupling has the form ( 66 ) .",
    "hence the borel summation of the new perturbative series is not prohibited by the ir renormalons , and one encounters in the right borel - parameter half - plane only the distant singularities due to instanton - antiinstanton @xmath274 pairs .",
