    "this figure suggests that the detection bias in this data set is likely to be small ; all of the precise - doppler planets in our data set could have been detected out to the period limit ( roughly 10 years ) , except for 55 cancri c , which could have been detected only out to a period of 6 years .",
    "however , other biases might lurk in the process of reporting and publishing the exoplanet data , and naturally , detecting planets via disk perturbations suffers from a special set of biases .",
    "our analysis bears repeating when more data become available .",
    "constructing a mmen from these data requires associating a surface density with each extrasolar planet . to derive these surface densities , we first must estimate an augmented mass for each planet  the mass each planet would have if it accreted just enough additional gas with the right chemistry so that it attained solar composition .",
    "we can convert the augmented mass to a surface density based on the spacings of the planets in multiple - planet systems .",
    "jupiter has a mass of 318  m@xmath41 and roughly 24 times solar abundances of c , n and s @xcite , suggesting that its augmented mass should be roughly 1000  m@xmath41 .",
    "estimates for the augmented masses of saturn , uranus and neptune are all consistent with this value , even though their actual masses span a factor of @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "this trend supports a planet formation scenario in which the observed range of planet masses arises mainly from variations in volatile depletion .",
    "we chose 1000  m@xmath41 for the augmented masses of most of the extrasolar planets .",
    "if we try to construct the minimum mass solar nebular from the orbits of jupiter , saturn , uranus and neptune under this approximation , we get @xmath43 , in rough agreement with the mmsn of @xcite .",

    "we used the measured minimum masses , @xmath49 , as the augmented masses for these planets . using @xmath49 for all the augmented masses would substantially increase the dispersion in the surface densities .    to derive surface densities , we divided each planet s augmented mass by the area of an appropriate annulus .",
    "here we harnessed the multiple planet systems ; we used the separation of the planets in log semimajor axis space as the full width of each annulus .",
    "in other words , we chose the boundaries of the annuli to be the geometric means of the adjacent semimajor axes .",
    "@xcite found that using an arithmetic mean or a geometric mean generated indistinguishable results for the solar system .",
    "however , the larger separations of the extrasolar planets seem to call for the use of the geometric mean , given the usual picture of feeding zones for planetary accretion that span widths measured in units of the local hill radius ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the extrasolar planets exhibit a much larger range of orbital eccentricities than the solar planets @xcite ; we do not attempt to take this factor into account .",

    "it lists the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 for minimum - mass nebulae fitted separately to each system .",
    "the table shows that @xmath50 for any two - planet system where both planets have the same mass ; this limitation of the algorithm prevents us from taking the separately - fitted nebulae too seriously or subdividing the data set in too much detail .",
    "the table also shows that the metallicities of the host stars range over 0.67 dex . at first",
    ", one might wonder how this spread in metallicity should affect the augmented masses .",
    "however , it turns out that for power - law models fit without any attempt to take account of stellar metallicity , @xmath13 shows no correlation with stellar metallicity , only scatter .",
    "this lack of a discernible trend suggests that metallicity corrections are beneath the fidelity of our method .",
    "table  [ tab : power ] shows @xmath13 and @xmath14 for power laws fit to the data taken as a whole and to subsets of the data .",
    "the power law best fit to the whole data set has the form @xmath51 .",
    "this form for the mmen has a total mass of 8 jupiter masses in the region 0.3 - 30 au , compared to 31 for the mmsn .",
    "this difference may result from the present inability of radial velocity techniques to measure orbital periods longer than @xmath52 years ; we may have only found 1/3 of the mass we will eventually find .",
    "figure  [ fig : mmen ] compares the above form for the mmen ( solid line ) with the standard mmsn , @xmath53 ( dashed line ) . assuming the logarithms of the surface densities have uncertainties of @xmath54 , the uncertainty in the exponent of the power - law fit to the entire data set is @xmath55 .",
    "given these assumptions , the standard mmsn is consistent with the exoplanet data .",
    ".best fit surface - density profiles . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : power ]",
    "by combining the data from several exoplanet systems , we have implicitly assumed that protoplanetary disks have a common surface - density distribution .",
    "such a common profile might stem from a steady - state model of the protoplanetary accretion disk , like the uniform-@xmath4 accretion disk model @xcite .",
    "however , the uniform-@xmath4 accretion disk model ( @xmath5 ) is not consistent with the mmen power law , and perhaps we should not expect it to be . this primary justification for this model is that a uniform @xmath4 is the simplest assumption one can make about anomalous disk viscosity .",
    "however , the reason for angular moment transport in disks is highly debated ; models of disk turbulence driven by magneto - rotational instability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that the angular momentum transport is highly non - uniform , and may not even be characterized by a viscosity .",
    "an alternative steady - state disk model is a massive circumstellar disk bordering on gravitational instability .",
    "spiral density waves may form in these disks that tend to redistribute angular momentum to maintain toomre s @xmath56 at @xmath57 throughout the disk @xcite . or else , planets could conceivably form via direct gravitational collapse of such disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , depending on the thermodynamic assumptions @xcite . for a disk with uniform @xmath56 , the surface density profile is determined by the square root of the local disk temperature , so a variety of disk thermal models would yield similar surface - density distributions .",
    "these disks are at least an order of magnitude more massive than the minimum mass nebulae we are considering .",
    "for example , a @xmath58 disk where the midplane temperature is @xmath59 @xcite has surface density @xmath60 .",
    "of course , the real solar nebula may seldom have been near a steady state ; t tauri stars are highly variable , and at any given stellar age , one can find stars both with and without accretion disks in the same cluster ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "one - dimensional models of protoplanetary disk accretion more sophisticated than the uniform-@xmath4 model @xcite generate time - variable surface density profiles .",
    "ironically , these models often use the mmsn as a starting point . in general , a non - steady - state picture of the protoplanetary disk stretches our interpretation of the mmsn and mmen ; all of the minimum mass need not have been available as free gas in the disk at the same time !      though taken as a whole , the extrasolar planet data agree with the mmsn , figure  [ fig : mmen ] and table  [ tab : power ] show that some extrasolar planetary systems themselves do not .",
    "the @xmath14 exponents for the three - exoplanet systems and for the solar system differ substantially ; the minimum - mass nebula constructed from the three - exoplanet systems has more mass concentrated in the center , like the uniform - q model mentioned above .",
    "these three - exoplanet systems are the ones for which our algorithm works the best .",
    "conventional wisdom holds that giant planets form at 25  au from the star , perhaps at the snow line , and that the close - in extrasolar planets migrated inward from where they formed @xcite . according to this picture",
    ", one might might expect the mmen to be more centrally peaked than the mmsn .",
    "perhaps the reason for the steep power law among the three - exoplanet systems is that these planets are more widely separated in semimajor axis than planets in the solar system ; with our prescription , increasing planet separations steepens the power law .",
    "the planet - disk interactions that cause the planets to migrate to small @xmath1 could create the wider separations ; massive planets can clear out the region between them in a protoplanetary disk via slowly damped spiral density waves @xcite , preventing more planets for growing in these regions .",
    "however , looking at things another way , the steeper nebular surface density distributions consistent with the mmen could have dramatic implications for where planets are formed .",
    "let us briefly indulge this alternative viewpoint .",
    "an annulus of the protoplanetary disk with width @xmath61 has mass @xmath62 . if this annulus is a feeding zone with @xmath63 and if @xmath64 , then @xmath65 . for the minimum - mass solar nebula ( @xmath3 ) and uniform-@xmath4 disk model ( @xmath5 ) , @xmath66 increases with radius , suggesting that more mass is available for planet - formation at larger distances from the star",
    "this tale  an exercise in circular reasoning  has been a standard argument for why giant planets ought not to form predominantly at the center of the disk",
    ".    however , for @xmath67 , @xmath66 decreases with radius , suggesting that the center of the disk is the most natural site for planet formation .",
    "perhaps giant planets predominantly form in the center of their disks and migrate outwards .    indeed ,",
    "suitable outward migration mechanisms for giant planets exist : type iii migration @xcite and planet - planet scattering @xcite .",
    "type iii migration begins when the planet grows larger than a threshold mass sufficient to begin opening a gap in the disk @xcite .",
    "some planet - planet interactions may also be required to produce the observed range of extrasolar - planet orbital eccentricities .",
    "outward type iii migration will halt at the outer boundary of the disk .",
    "@xcite have suggested that the disk may develop an edge or a gap at @xmath68 au when the photoevaporation time scale matches the viscous spreading time scale .",
    "the exact nature and location of this edge remain uncertain . however , the disk probably photoevaporates first outside @xmath68  au , providing a natural stopping place for outward planet migration .",
    "this inside - out planet - formation scenario has several attractive features .",
    "while no direct observational evidence has yet been found for a special structure at the snow line in protoplanetary disks , abundant new evidence from near infrared spectroscopy @xcite and interferometry @xcite implies that t tauri disks have dramatic opacity jumps at @xmath69 au .",
    "models of layered accretion disks @xcite suggest that even while most of the disk has @xmath70 , the center of the disk could become gravitationally unstable , fostering planet formation by disk instability .",
    "moreover , formation of the planets in the center of the disk could potentially solve two problems in the core accretion picture :    * type i migration of giant planet cores *    conventional simulations of the semimajor axis distribution of the extrasolar planets @xcite neglect type i migration @xcite on the grounds that no planets could form at the snow line if this mechanism operated .",
    "although present calculations of the migration of the small bodies do not accurately include torques added in the coorbital region @xcite , these torques are likely to dominate the net lindblad torque , not compensate for it , exacerbating the problem . however , several mechanisms have been suggested that could stop migration of cores in the center of the disk @xcite .    * the missing short - period pile - up *    @xcite and @xcite pointed out that the distribution of planet orbital periods shorter than @xmath71 days is consistent with a power law , and that scenarios where planets migrate inwards and stop migrating at a special small orbital period should produce a much larger pile - up of planets at short periods than observed . @xcite invoked tidal - driven roche - lobe overflow to remove this exaggerated pile - up of planets in 3-day orbits expected from monte - carlo migration models .",
    "however , most of the stopping mechanisms cited above are not specific to precisely three - day periods , and since tidal forces decay as @xmath72 , tide - induced roche - lobe overflow can probably not help prevent pile - ups at say , a 6-day period .",
    "if planets mostly migrated outwards when they grew beyond a threshold mass as type iii accretion models suggest , this missing pile - up problem would not arise .",
    "two effects make the very center of the disk ( 0.05 - 0.1 au ) problematic for core acretion : heating of the planet by tidal interaction with the star @xcite and the large critical core radius for gas accretion at high nebular temperatures @xcite . however , the region at @xmath73  au could be fertile ground for planet formation by either core accretion or disk instability .",
    "the disk temperature there is potentially low enough that the critial core radius shrinks to where it is consistent with the inferred core mass of jupiter and saturn @xcite particularly if this region is shadowed by a puffed - up inner wall of the disk @xcite .",
    "conceivably , the observed extrasolar planets all could have formed at 0.10.2  au and migrated outwards to their current orbits .",
    "the solar system giants might also have formed via this process , though this possibility raises the question of the origin of the abundant low - temperature condensates in the envelopes of these planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a question still inadequately answered by any planet - formation model .",
    "by analogy with the minimum mass solar nebula , we constructed the surface density distribution for a minimum - mass extrasolar nebula based on the orbits of the extrasolar planets in two- and three - planet systems : @xmath74 .",
    "the standard mmsn is consistent with the exoplanet data taken as a whole , though the uniform-@xmath4 accretion disk @xcite is not .    in general",
    ", though the mmsn is consistent with the mmen , our analysis illustrates that the logic that led to the mmsn supports a wide range of disk surface - density profiles , none of which can serve as a complete picture .",
    "the mmsn was based on laplace s concept of the solar nebula as a smooth disk that broke up into rings that condensed into planets .",
    "in contrast , true protoplanetary disks are likely actively accreting and time variable",
    ".    our analysis led us to consider the ramifications of alternative surface - density distributions .",
    "we pointed out that in the centrally - concentrated nebular model suggested by the three - exoplanet systems , the center of the disk is the preferred site for planet formation .",
    "the extrasolar giant planets  and possibly the giant planets of the solar - system  could have formed at @xmath75  au and migrated outwards to their present orbits via type iii migration and planet - planet scattering .",
    "our simple model is not intended to replace the mmsn , but to illuminate its shortcomings and to expose our solar - centrism .",
