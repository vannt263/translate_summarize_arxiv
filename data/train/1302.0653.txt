    "the year 2012 represents a milestone in neutrino physics . thanks to the measurement of the last mixing angle of the standard neutrino oscillation scenario , @xmath0 , by the reactor experiments double - chooz  @xcite , daya - bay@xcite and reno  @xcite , after the first positive evidence from accelerators  @xcite , the mixing in the leptonic sector is starting to shape up .",
    "the impact of a rather unexpectedly large mixing angle @xmath0 is two fold : it promotes the discovery of cp violation in the neutrino sector to a yet daunting but conceivable task , and at the same time it proves that the description of neutrino oscillation data must involve all three standard model neutrino flavors .",
    "hints of the sensitivity to cp phases are already showing their first signs when we combine accelerator @xmath1 with reactor @xmath2 data  @xcite or when we perform global fits  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the combined fit of neutrino oscillation data shows for the first time a very precise and almost complete determination of the parameters that enter the standard neutrino oscillation scheme .",
    "in fact , in spite of the unknowns ( neutrino mass hierarchy , absolute neutrino mass scale , cp phases and the correct octant for @xmath3 ) all measured parameters are now so well determined that it is enough to quote them by giving the best fit value with the 1 @xmath4 uncertainty .    however , not all neutrino data can be explained by this standard scenario of three flavor neutrinos .",
    "in fact , along the years a number of so - called _ anomalies _ have crept into the picture .",
    "first , the excess of @xmath5 events in the @xmath6 mode observed by the short baseline lsnd  @xcite experiment , now also supported by miniboone data  @xcite , gave rise to the long - standing _",
    "lsnd anomaly_. second , the deficit of @xmath7 compared to expectations observed by the source calibration experiments performed in the gallium radiochemical solar neutrino detectors gallex  @xcite and sage  @xcite .",
    "this is the so - called _",
    "gallium anomaly_. third , and more recently , a re - evaluation of the reactor @xmath8 flux  @xcite resulted in an increase of the total flux by 3.5% . while this increase has essentially no impact on the results of long baseline experiments , it induces a deficit of about 5.7% in the observed event rates for short baseline ( @xmath9 m ) reactor neutrino experiments .",
    "this problem has been referred to as the _ reactor antineutrino anomaly _",
    "@xcite .",
    "there are attempts in the literature that try to explain some or all of these anomalies by extending the standard picture to include one or more sterile neutrinos  @xcite",
    ". these extensions , as a rule , can not make appearance and disappearance experiments compatible .",
    "however , if one disregards the anomaly connected with the appearance experiments lsnd / miniboone ( for instance , assuming it is not due to oscillations ) , it is possible to construct a coherent picture of all solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator neutrino oscillation data adding one extra sterile neutrino to the standard framework .",
    "this constitutes what has been known as the 3 + 1 scenario .",
    "given the current status of the mixing parameters measurements , and in view of the progress expected in the near future , we think it is timely to analyze the possible structures and correlations among the neutrino mass matrix elements that are compatible with data . in this sense , we update refs .",
    "@xcite using the most recent available data . however , our analysis will be probabilistic , since we will construct probability distribution functions for each element of the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "we also discuss how this might change with better determination of the presently known oscillation parameters , as well as , the dirac cp - phase @xmath10 .",
    "we hope this can be helpful to understand better the patterns statistically preferred by data , and serve as a guide for model builders .",
    "we organize our paper as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : general - method ] we describe how we will proceed for the construction of probability density functions ( pdf ) for each element of the neutrino mass matrix and what are the assumptions in each case . in sec .",
    "[ sec : standard ] we analyze the possible textures of the mass matrix in the standard scenario , discussing the correlations among matrix elements in the hierarchical and almost degenerate cases .",
    "we also discuss the future prospects for better determining these matrix elements with neutrino oscillation and non - oscillation data , and the possible impact on the theory . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 + 1 ] we extend our analysis to include the possibility of a sterile neutrino with mass and mixings allowed by the reactor and gallium anomalies .",
    "we discuss what is the mass matrix pattern in this scenario and how different it will be from the standard case . finally , in sec.[sec : conclusions ]",
    ", we make our last comments and draw our conclusions .",
    "to access the impact of the progress on the determination of the neutrino oscillation parameters in the last year on the knowledge of the low energy effective neutrino mass matrix , in a probabilistic way , we will construct a pdf for each element of the mass matrix in the gauge basis ,    @xmath11    with @xmath12 , @xmath13 being the elements of the mixing matrix , @xmath14 the neutrino masses and @xmath15 the majorana - type cp phases , using the most recent available information from the combination of neutrino oscillation data . without loss of generality we will take @xmath16 in our parametrization .",
    "we will use the following best fit points for the standard mixing parameters  @xcite @xmath17 and assume these parameters to follow a normal distribution with mean at the best fit point and standard deviation equal to the 1 @xmath4 uncertainty .",
    "we will take the unknown dirac - type and majorana - type cp phases to be flat distributed between 0 and @xmath18 .",
    "for the 3 + 1 scenario we will fix the squared mass difference between the sterile and the lightest state to two different experimentally allowed values , @xmath19 ev@xmath20 and @xmath21 ev@xmath20 , allowing the corresponding mixing to vary with a flat distribution inside the ranges @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .    to construct the pdf of each @xmath24 we use a monte carlo method .",
    "for all the mixing parameters , we generate random numbers according to their assumed distribution , and compute all the elements of @xmath25 in each case . in this manner",
    "their distribution will be naturally correlated .    since we do not know the neutrino mass hierarchy , the correct octant for @xmath3 and the absolute neutrino mass scale",
    ", we will have to analyze each case separately .",
    "in the standard scenario we use the standard parametrization for the mixing matrix , @xmath26 with @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath10 the dirac - type cp phase .",
    "the two additional majorana - type cp phases are denoted by @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and the three neutrino mass eigenstates are ordered either as @xmath31 ( normal ordering ) or as @xmath32 ( inverted ordering ) .",
    "we will study six different cases : hierarchical with @xmath33 and @xmath3 both in the first and second octant ; hierarchical with @xmath34 and @xmath3 in the first and second octant ; quasi - degenerate with @xmath35 ev and @xmath3 in the first and second octant .",
    "there are two possible ordering also in the quasi - degenerate case ; however , we have checked that the results are very similar .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mee - s13 ] we illustrate , for the case @xmath36 , the impact of the determination of @xmath37 on the pdf of @xmath38 . the distribution labeled `` before '' ( magenta )",
    "is obtained assuming @xmath37 to be flat distributed between 0 and 0.04 ( chooz limit @xcite ) , while the one labeled `` after '' ( blue ) shows the current situation .",
    "the two peaks in the `` after '' distribution are due to the interference between the real @xmath39 term and the complex @xmath40 term ( see appendix  [ appendixa ] for detailed expressions ) , which depends on the cosine of the randomly distributed cp - phases .",
    "this term depends on @xmath0 which is not compatible with zero anymore and thus gives a sizable contribution .",
    "the distance between the peaks depends on @xmath41 : a larger @xmath41 would place the peaks further apart .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mmm - s23 ] we illustrate , again for the case @xmath33 , the effect of the determination of the @xmath3 octant on the pdf of @xmath42 .",
    "on the left ( right ) panel we show the current distribution of @xmath43 for the best fit value of @xmath44 in the first ( second ) octant .",
    "the asymmetric two peaks structure is due to the fact that @xmath45 is not maximal .",
    "a larger @xmath41 would shift the right endpoint of the distribution to higher values of @xmath42 , while a larger @xmath46 would separate the two peaks .",
    "we observe that the distribution on the right panel is thinner than the one on the left panel , but this is simply because the uncertainty on @xmath47 is smaller in the second octant . for comparison , in both panels",
    "we also show the pdf taking the minos result @xmath48  @xcite .     when @xmath36 . the `` before '' ( `` after '' ) distribution corresponds to the situation before ( after ) the determination of @xmath37 by the reactor experiments.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]     when @xmath36 .",

    "the pdfs for the solution in the first @xmath3 octant are basically the same as for the solution in the second octant ( apart from the uncertainty in the determination of @xmath44 , which is smaller for the second octant ) as long as we replace : @xmath54 , @xmath55 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : nh1st ] we show the correlations among the absolute values of some of the matrix elements @xmath24 for @xmath33 and @xmath3 in the first octant . in appendix [ appendixb ]",
    "we present a complete set of those plots , as well as the corresponding plots for @xmath3 taken to be in the second octant .",
    "this was done by constructing a two - dimensional pdf for each pair of elements .",
    "we also present in each case on the top and to the right of each two - dimensional distribution the projected pdfs . in these plots we use blue , green and red for the allowed region at 68.27% , 95.45% and 99.73%",
