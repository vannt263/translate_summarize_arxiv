    "being able to simulate indirect illumination at an extremely fast rate is crucial to the overall system performance , since each object tracking step requires multiple simulation runs .",
    "like all prior work , we assume that the wall is planar and known , and so is the position of the laser spot . the object is represented as a collection of lambertian surface elements ( _ surfels _ ) , each characterized by its position , normal direction and area .",
    "as the object is moved or rotated , all its surfels undergo the same rigid transformation .",
    "we represent this transformation by the _ scene parameter _ @xmath0 , which is a three - dimensional vector for pure translation , or a six - dimensional vector for translation and rotation .",
    "the irradiance received by a given camera pixel is computed by summing the light that reflects off the surfels .",
    "the individual contributions , in turn , are obtained independently of each other as detailed in the methods section , by calculating the radiative transfer from the laser spot via a surfel to the location on the wall observed by a pixel .",
    "note that by following this procedure , like all prior work , we neglect self - occlusion , occlusion of ambient light , and interreflections . to efficiently obtain a full - frame image , represented by the vector of pixel values @xmath1 , we parallelized the simulation to compute each pixel in a separate thread on the graphics card .",
    "the rendering time is approximately linear in the number of pixels and the number of surfels . on an nvidia geforce gtx",

    "intensity difference images . to investigate the effect of changes in object position and orientation on the intensity distribution observed on the wall",
    ", we performed a simplified synthetic experiment with an orthographic view of a 2m@xmath22 m wall , and laser spot and object centered with respect to the wall .",
    "the reference distribution ( bottom left ) was produced by a 10cm@xmath210 cm square - shaped object , located at 50 cm from the wall .",
    "six difference images ( top row ) , obtained by translating ( @xmath42.5 cm ) and rotating ( @xmath47.5@xmath5 ) the object about the x , y and z axes , illustrate the distribution and magnitude of the respective change in the signal .",
    "the images shown in the bottom row visualize the difference caused by a change in shape . for display , each difference image has been amplified by the indicated factor ( 2 to 100,000 ) that also reflects the relative significance of the effect : translations and rotations ( except around the y axis ) caused the signal to change by roughly 1% per centimeter or per angular degree . a change in the object shape led to a peak difference around 12% , and rotation around the y axis had a much smaller effect . ]    to estimate the magnitude of changes in the intensity distribution that are caused by motion or a change in shape , we performed a numerical experiment using this simulation . in this experiment",
    ", we used a fronto - parallel view on a 2m@xmath22 m wall , with a small planar object ( a 10cm@xmath210 cm white square ) located at 50 cm from the wall .",
    "object and laser spot were centered on the wall , but not rendered into the image .",
    "[ fig : differenceimages ] shows the simulated response thus obtained . by varying position and location of the object",
    ", we obtained difference images that can be interpreted as partial derivatives with respect to the components of the scene parameter @xmath6 . since the overall light throughput drops with the fourth power of the object - wall distance , translation in y direction caused the strongest change .",
    "translation in all directions and rotation about the x and z axes affected the signal more strongly than the other variations . with differences amounting to several percent of the overall intensity , these changes were significant enough to be detected using a standard digital camera with 8- to 12-bit a / d converter .",

    "due to practical constraints , some of the idealizing assumptions made during the synthetic experiment had to be relaxed .",
    "in particular , only an off - peak portion of the intensity pattern could be observed , and we had to shield the camera from the laser spot to avoid lens flare .",
    "the actual reflectance distribution of the wall and object surfaces was not perfectly lambertian , and additional light emitters and reflectors , not accounted for by the simulation , were present in the scene . to obtain a measured image @xmath7 containing only light from the laser , we took the difference of images captured with and without laser illumination . additionally , we subtracted a calibration measurement @xmath8 containing light reflected by the background .",

    "derivatives are computed by numerical differentiation .",

    "the physical object used in all experiments was a car silhouette cut from plywood and coated with white wall paint , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : objectshape](a ) . while our setup is able to handle arbitrary three - dimensional objects ( as long as the convexity assumption is reasonable ) , this shape was two - dimensional for manufacturing and handling reasons .    for",

    "[ fig : objectshape](b ) shows a slice of the function for translation in the xy - plane , with all other parameters fixed .",
    "although the global minimum is located in an elongated , curved trough , only four to five iterations of the levenberg - marquardt algorithm are required for convergence from a random location in the tracking volume . in real - time applications , since position and rotation can be expected to change slowly over time , the optimization effort can be reduced to two to three iterations per frame by using the latest tracking result to initialize the solution for the next frame .     tracking a known object .",
    "* a , * result of three tracking sessions where the object was translated along the x , y and z axes ( experiment 1 ) .",

    "the higher uncertainty reflects the fact that rotation in general has a smaller effect on the signal , and the ambiguity between translational and rotational motion ( also see fig .  2 . ) . ]    in * experiment 1 * , we kept the object s orientation constant .",
    "we manually placed the object at various known locations in an 60cm@xmath250cm@xmath260 cm working volume , and recorded 100 camera frames at each location .",
    "these frames differ in the amount of ambient light ( mains flicker ) and in the photon noise . for each frame , we initialized the estimated position to a random starting point in a cube of dimensions ( 30cm)@xmath17 centered in the tracking volume , and refined the position estimate by minimizing the cost function ( equation  1 ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",

    ", we found positional tracking to be repeatable and robust to noise , with a sub - cm standard deviation for each position estimate .",
    "the root - mean - square distance to ground truth was measured at 4.8 cm , 2.9 cm and 2.4 cm for movement along the x , y and z axis , respectively .",
    "this small systematic bias was likely caused by a known shortcoming of the image formation model , which does not account for occlusion of ambient light by the object .    in * experiment 2 * , we kept the object at a ( roughly ) fixed location and rotated it by a range of @xmath430@xmath5 around the three coordinate axes using a pan - tilt - roll tripod with goniometers on all joints .",

    "[ fig : knownobjecttracking](b ) .",
    "as expected , the rotation angles were tracked with higher uncertainty than the translational parameters .",
    "we identify two main sources for this uncertainty : the increased number of degrees of freedom and the pairwise ambiguity between x translation and z rotation , and between z translation and x rotation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : differenceimages ] ) .",
    "we recall that in the synthetic experiment , the effect of y rotation was vanishingly small ; here , the system tracked rotation around the y axis about as robustly as the other axes .",
    "this unexpectedly positive result was probably owed to the strongly asymmetric shape of the car object .",
    "tracking of an unknown object , or in an unknown room . * a , * result of experiment 3 : positional tracking as in experiment 1 , but with no knowledge about the object shape .",
    "we used a single oriented surface element for the light transport simulation .",
    "* b , * result of experiment 4 : positional tracking as in experiment 1 , but without subtracting the pre - calibrated room response .",
    "the estimated absolute position greatly deviated from the ground - truth position ( shaded areas ) .",
    "* c , * subtraction of a linear fit significantly reduced the tracking error and makes the tracking task feasible even in the absence of a background measurement . in all cases ,",
    "the standard deviation ( error bars ) remained small , indicating that changes in position could still be robustly detected . ]     approximating the background term by a linear model . from left to right : background term @xmath8 obtained through calibration , linear approximation of @xmath8 , residual background term after subtraction of linear component . ]    so far , we assumed that the object s shape was known .",
    "since this requirement can not always be met , we dropped it in * experiment 3*. we used the data already captured using the car object for the first experiment , but performed the light transport simulation using a single oriented surface element instead of the detailed object model . except for this simplification , we followed the exact same procedure as in experiment 1 to track the now unknown object s position .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : unknownobjecttracking](a ) .",
    "despite a significant systematic shift introduced by the use of the simplified object model , the position recovery remained robust to noise and relative movement was still detected reliably .",
    "the need for a measured background term @xmath8 can hinder the practical applicability of our approach as pursued so far . in * experiment 4 * , we lifted this requirement . when omitting the term without any compensation , the tracking performance degraded significantly ( fig .",
    "[ fig : unknownobjecttracking](b ) ) .",
    "however , we observed that the background image , caused by distant scattering , was typically smooth and well approximated by a linear function @xmath18 in the image coordinates @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : backgroundlinearity ] ) .",
    "we extended the tracking algorithm to fit such linear models to both input images @xmath7 and @xmath1 , and subtract the linear portions prior to evaluating the cost function ( eq .  2 ) .",
    "this simple pre - processing step greatly reduced the bias in the tracking outcome and enabled robust tracking of object motion ( fig .",

    "the supplementary material to this paper contains two videos , each showing a real - time tracking session ( session 1 : translation only ; session 2 : translation and rotation ) using the described setup .",
    "a live view of the hidden scene is shown alongside screen output from the tracking software .",
    "the average reconstruction rate during these tracking sessions was 10.2 frames per second ( limited by the maximum capture rate of our camera - laser setup ) for session 1 , and 3.7 frames per second ( limited by computation ) for session 2 .",
    "the 2-dimensional car model was represented by 502 surfels ; the total compute time required for a single tracking step was 72.9ms for translation only , and 226.1ms for translation and rotation .",
    "[ [ discussion . ] ] discussion .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + +    in this work , we showed that the popular challenge of tracking an object around a corner does not inherently necessitate the use of time - of - flight technology .",
    "rather , by formulating an optimization problem based on a simplistic image formation model , we demonstrated parametric object tracking in a room - sized scene with sub - cm repeatability , only using 2d images with a laser pointer as the light source .",
    "as our technique , in its current form , does not rely on temporally resolved measurements of any kind , it has the unique property of being scalable to very small scenes ( down to the diffraction limit ) as well as large scenes ( sufficient laser power provided ) .",
    "we identify two main limiting factors to the performance of our technique : a systematic bias caused by shortcomings in the scene and light transport models , and high sensitivity to image noise when tracking object rotation .",
    "the adoption of advanced light transport models and noise reduction techniques will further improve the tracking quality .",
    "we note that the analysis - by - synthesis approach _ per se _ is not limited to intensity imaging , but may form a valuable complement to other sensing modalities as well .",
    "for instance , a simple extension to the light transport model would enable it to accommodate time - of - flight imaging .",
    "like in all prior work , we assumed knowledge about the geometry and reflectance of a wall that receives light scattered by the unknown object .",
    "thanks to recent progress in mobile mapping@xcite , such data is already widely available for many application scenarios .",
    "we imagine a potential application of our technique to be in urban traffic safety , where the motion of vehicles and pedestrians is constrained to the ground plane and hence described by a small number of degrees of freedom .",
