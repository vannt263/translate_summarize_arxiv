    "since the discovery of the colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) effect , mn oxides with a perovskite structure and their derivatives have been intensively investigated . in particular ,",
    "two - dimensional ferromagnetic ( fm ) metal ( la , sr)@xmath2mn@xmath13o@xmath14 has been attracting much attention because such metals are rarely reported .",
    "sr@xmath2fe@xmath3co@xmath4o@xmath5 can be expected as one of such rare materials[1 ,  2 ] .",
    "the end material sr@xmath2fe@xmath13o@xmath5 is an antiferromagnet below @xmath15 = 120 k , and changes from a semiconductor to a metal at 350 k[3 ] . with increasing co - concentration",
    ", this system approaches an fm metal and negative magnetoresistance ( mr ) is observed .",
    "ghosh @xmath16 @xmath17",
    ".  suggest that the ferromagnetism is driven by spin - dependent electron transfer processes between fe@xmath18 and co@xmath18[4 ] .",
    "since highly oxidized states of both fe@xmath18 and co@xmath18 are unstable , the crystal structure of sr@xmath2fe@xmath3co@xmath4o@xmath5 has a large amount of oxygen vacancies .",
    "the oxygen deficiency @xmath19 of sr@xmath2fe@xmath20co@xmath21o@xmath5 treated under high oxygen pressure of 600 bar at 1173 k is 0.20 @xmath22 0.01[4 ] .",
    "a decrease in the average valence of @xmath23-site cations weakens the spin - dependent electron transfer process , which probably leads to coexistence of fm and afm ( or pm ) phases .",
    "such phase coexistence can be expected to enhance the mr of sr@xmath2fe@xmath3co@xmath4o@xmath5 , as is often the case with cmr manganites . in  this study , in order to enhance the mr , we have prepared @xmath1-substituted sr@xmath2fe@xmath11co@xmath12o@xmath5 and have investigated the physical properties .",
    "sr@xmath24fe@xmath11co@xmath12o@xmath5 was prepared in a polycrystalline form by a solid - state reaction method .",
    "mixed powders of srco@xmath2 , @xmath25o@xmath2 ( @xmath1 = la , nd , and gd ) , fe@xmath2o@xmath26 , and coo were heated at 1173 k in air and sintered at 1673 k in o@xmath13 .",
    "the sample was then annealed under high oxygen pressure of 240 bar at 773  k for 10 h , and cooled down to about 300 k at a rate of 40 k / h .",
    "crystallographic analysis of the obtained samples was performed by x - ray diffraction method at room temperature .",
    "the oxygen content of the synthesized samples was estimated using iodometric titration with an accuracy of @xmath22 0.02 .",
    "the magnetic properties were measured using a quantum design , physical property measurement system ( ppms - 9 t ) .",
    "the resistivity was measured using a standard four - probe method .",
    "figures 1 ( a ) and ( b ) show the temperature dependence of the magnetization ( @xmath27-@xmath28 ) and magnetization curves ( @xmath27-@xmath29 ) of sr@xmath30fe@xmath11co@xmath12o@xmath5 ( @xmath1 = la and gd ) .",
    "the @xmath27-@xmath28 of sr@xmath2fe@xmath11co@xmath12o@xmath5 shows an increase below 250 k. the zero field cooling ( zfc ) process deviates from field cooling ( fc ) below 80 k. the magnetization is fm below 250 k , and the magnetization value reaches about 2.8 @xmath31/@xmath23-site at 50 k , as seen from the @xmath27-@xmath29 curve .",
    "these magnetic behaviors result from the emergence of the cluster glass state , as previously reported[1 ] .",
    "this cluster glass - like behavior is prominent below 80 k. in  sr@xmath9la@xmath10fe@xmath11co@xmath12o@xmath5 , the onset temperature of the fm transition shifts to lower temperatures , and the fm moment is slightly suppressed ( fig .",
    "1(b ) ) . in the case of gd@xmath32-substitution , the fm moment is close to that of sr@xmath9la@xmath10fe@xmath11co@xmath12o@xmath5 , but the fm transition temperature is further lower to around 150 k.    figures 1 ( c ) and ( d ) show the temperature dependence of the resistivity and mr of sr@xmath30fe@xmath11co@xmath12o@xmath5 . here",
    "the mr value is defined as mr = ( @xmath33(80 koe ) @xmath34 @xmath33(0 koe ) ) / @xmath33(0  koe ) .",
    "the resistivity of sr@xmath2fe@xmath11co@xmath12o@xmath5 is semiconducting , and the negative mr is observed below the onset temperature of ferromagnetism .",
    "the absolute value of mr ,  @xmath35mr@xmath36 , increases gradually up to @xmath37 % at 5  k with decreasing temperature .",
    "la@xmath32-substitution makes this system insulating , while the mr of @xmath1 = la is slightly enhanced compared with that of sr@xmath2fe@xmath11co@xmath12o@xmath5 at low temperatures . with decreasing the ionic radius of @xmath0 , the resistivity is increasing and the @xmath35mr@xmath36 is further enhanced from @xmath38 % ( nondoped ) to @xmath39 % ( @xmath1  =  gd ) .",
    "figures 2 ( a ) and ( b ) show the @xmath27-@xmath29 curve and isothermal mr of sr@xmath9la@xmath10fe@xmath11co@xmath12o@xmath5 at 5  k. a significant difference between la@xmath32-doped and nondoped samples is that a metamagnetic transition is found in the la@xmath32-doped sample around 16  koe .",
    "the metamagnetic transition accompanies an abrupt decrease in the resistivity and is reversibly observed by applying magnetic fields .",
    "similar metamagnetic behavior is observed in all the @xmath0-substituted samples , but not in the nondoped sample .",
    "we discuss the origin of the enhancement of the mr of sr@xmath30fe@xmath11co@xmath12o@xmath5 .",
    "we confirmed that the @xmath19 of the @xmath0-substituted sample almost coincides with that of sr@xmath2fe@xmath11co@xmath12o@xmath5 by iodometric titration .",
    "in other words , @xmath0-substitution merely decreases the average valence of the @xmath23-site cation .",
    "an oxygen - vacancy ordered structure ( or oxygen stoichiometry ) might exist in the vicinity of @xmath19 = 0.20 .",
    "such a decrease in the average valence of the @xmath23-site cation probably creates antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ( or non - fm ) clusters around @xmath0 .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to conclude that the suppression of ferromagnetism by @xmath0-substitution is due to the creation of these afm ( or non - fm ) clusters .",
    "the volume reduction of the fm clusters and randomness due to @xmath0-substitution cause the resistivity to be insulating .",
    "the fm clusters are aligned parallel to applied magnetic fields . as a result , the large negative mr is observed .",
    "in addition , metamagnetism accompanying a  reduction in the resistivity also contributes to the enhancement of the mr at low temperatures .",
    "we have investigated a quasi two - dimensional ferromagnet sr@xmath2fe@xmath11co@xmath12o@xmath5 partially substituted by @xmath0 .",
    "this substitution of @xmath0 suppresses ferromagnetism and causes the system to be more insulating , which are attributed to an increase in afm clusters created around @xmath0 . in sr@xmath9gd@xmath10fe@xmath11co@xmath12o@xmath5 ,",
    "the mr value is enhanced by about 20 % compared with that of sr@xmath2fe@xmath11co@xmath12o@xmath5 .",
    "competition between fm and afm ( or non - fm ) clusters is essential for the enhancement of the mr .",
    "one of the plausible explanations for the origin of this enhanced mr is as follows . when applying magnetic fields to sr@xmath9gd@xmath10fe@xmath11co@xmath12o@xmath5 , the fm clusters are aligned in the same direction , resulting in a reduction in resistivity .",
    "in addition , in the @xmath0-doped samples , a metamagnetic transition accompanying an abrupt decrease in the resistivity occurs at low temperatures , which also contributes to the enhancement of the mr of sr@xmath30fe@xmath11co@xmath12o@xmath5 .",
    "this work was partly supported by the asahi glass foundation , and grant - in - aid for scientific research ( c ) from the japan society for promotion of science ."
