    "disorder plays a crucial role in the static and dynamic properties of the mixed state of high - tc cuprates @xcite .",
    "a main feature of the diagram phase is the phase transition separating a high temperature vortex liquid - like state from a low temperature vortex solid - like state . in particular , the nature of the latter depends on the strength and the dimensionality of disorder . in the presence of an unidimensional disorder ,",
    "nelson and vinokur predict a bose - glass @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we shall concern ourselves with the variable - range vortex hopping transport predicted in a bose - glass .",
    "we studied two bi@xmath0sr@xmath0ca@xmath1y@xmath2cu@xmath0o@xmath3 crystals with @xmath4 ( sample a ) and @xmath5 ( sample b ) whose the zero - field critical temperature t@xmath6 are 89.1k and 91k respectively . both samples approximately had dimensions 1@xmath71@xmath70.030 mm@xmath8 and",
    "were together irradiated with 5.8 gev pb ions at the _ grand acclrateur national dions lourds ( ganil ) _ at caen , france .",
    "irradiation doses expressed in terms of a matching field b@xmath9 were 1.5 t ( sample a ) and 0.75 t ( sample b ) . in both cases",
    "the incident beam was parallel to the c - axis of the crystal .",
    "the resulting damage consists of parallel columnar defects of radius @xmath10   throughout the thickness of the sample .",
    "isothermal current - voltage ( i - v ) curves were recorded by using a dc four probe method with a sensitivity better than 10@xmath11v and a temperature stability better than 5mk .",
    "the magnetic field was aligned parallel to the columnar defects .",
    "we have examined in some detail the behaviour of i - v curves in magnetic fields less than b@xmath9 .",
    "a detailed discussion of data in the framework of the bose - glass melting theory @xcite will be published in a separate paper . at low temperature ,",
    "we find in the limit of weak currents a non - linear thermally actived flux - creep resistivity @xmath12 where the glassy exponent @xmath13 is independent of b and takes the value @xmath14 . we have determined @xmath13 as was shown in a former paper @xcite .",
    "such barrier energies at low current is indeed the very signature of variable - range vortex hopping@xcite . to test the accuracy of the above view , we estimate from the theory @xcite the energy scale and the characteristic current in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "the energy scale @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 with @xmath17 the mean distance between columns , @xmath18 the tilt modulus where @xmath19 is the anisotropic parameter , @xmath20 is the line tension and @xmath21 is the vortice - lattice constant , and @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the mean pinning energy , @xmath24 is the energy scale for the pinning and @xmath25 accounts for thermal effects . in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the density of pinning energies at the chemical potential .",
    "note that @xmath28 is normalized such that @xmath29 .",
    "although a form of @xmath28 is not yet available , an estimate of @xmath27 can be done in terms of @xmath30 the energy dispersion of pinning energies .",
    "such an intrinsic dispersion originates from the intervortex repulsion and the presence of disorder .",
    "the field independent value of the glass exponent @xmath31 suggests that @xmath30 is dominated by the disorder effect , and thus we can consider @xmath28 as a smooth function near @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "then , @xmath33 , wherefrom we obtain @xmath34 in this case , one expects @xmath30 to be given by the combination of the energy dispersion arising from the structural disorder and the one , @xmath35 , which results from some on - site disorder @xcite , @xmath36 an estimate for the energy dispersion due to the structural disorder , i.e. , the randomness in the distance between the irradiation tracks , has been made in terms of the hopping matrix element connecting sites separated by the typical distance d @xcite , @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "on the other hand , assuming the variations in the defect diameters induced by the dispersion of the ion beam as the first cause for random on - site energies , we approximate @xmath35 to the width of the distribution of pinning energies @xmath39 where the pinning energies @xmath40 and the defect radius @xmath41 are related to one another through the formula @xcite @xmath42   \\label{eq:7}\\ ] ] and @xmath43 define a distribution of defects , such that @xmath44 is the number of columns per unit area with radius less than @xmath41 and @xmath43 is normalized such that @xmath45 .     vs @xmath46    the solid lines shown in fig .",
    "[ fg:1 ] are a fit of @xmath47 to data .",
    "the exponent 1/3 accounts for the value of the glassy exponent @xmath13 .",
    "we have used the temperature dependence as predicted in the two - fluid model for the in - plane penetration depth i.e. , @xmath48^{-1/2}$ ] , and we have chosen a gaussian distribution for @xmath43 centered at @xmath49 , with a width @xmath50 . indeed , fig .",
    "[ fg:1 ] shows that the theoretical curves and experimental data quantitatively agree .",
    "it should be noted that the model fits above @xmath51 fail .",
    "such a fit results in realistic values for fitting parameters as shown on the table [ tb:1 ] where @xmath52 denotes the in - plane coherence length at @xmath53 .",
    ".fitting parameters [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tb:1 ]    table [ tb:1 ] shows two significant points .",
    "first , the mean value of defect diameters @xmath54  with a dispersion of @xmath55 % is typical of damage track diameters produced in bi - based compounds with 5.8 gev pb ions @xcite .",
    "second , the only superconducting parameter variable is the penetration depth @xmath56 .",
    "if one assumes that @xmath56 is independent of @xmath57 , it clearly appears that @xmath56 increases with @xmath58 as expected for an underdoped sample @xcite .",
    "finally , we make a comparison between @xmath35 and @xmath59 .",
    "we obtain temperature dependent ratios of @xmath35 to @xmath59 of order 100 . according to the eq .",
    "[ eq:4 ] , this means that the energy dispersion mainly arises from the on - site disorder .",
    "we find striking evidence ( for @xmath60 ) for a variable - range vortex hopping mechanism originating in the random pinning energies induced by the energy dispersion of the ion beam ."
