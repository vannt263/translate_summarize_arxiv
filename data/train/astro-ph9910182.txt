    "@xmath1-body simulations with power - law initial power spectra ( navarro , frenk , & white 1997 , hereafter nfw ) suggest that density profiles of dark halos in large range of masses are well fitted by a simple universal formula that steepens from @xmath2 near the center of the halo to @xmath3 at large distances .",
    "the shape of the profile can be described by the concentration parameter @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the virial radius and @xmath6 is the scale radius at which the slope is @xmath7 .",
    "the concentration parameter was observed to decrease with the mass of the halo for a wide range of cosmological models , that is in general the smaller the halo mass the steeper its profile .",
    "the improved spherical infall model ( hereafter sim ) of okas ( 1999 ) reproduces this behaviour in the case of @xmath8 universe and scale - free power spectra .",
    "the improved version of the model involves the generalized form of the initial density distribution and introduces a cut - off in this distribution at the distance equal to half the separation between typical density peaks .",
    "recently bullock et al . ( 1999 ) observed in their @xmath1-body simulations of @xmath9cdm model that the dependence of concentration parameter of a halo of given mass on redshift @xmath10 , at which the halo profiles are measured , is @xmath11 .",
    "as shown in the next section , the same behaviour follows from the model proposed by nfw to describe their results in the case of scale - free spectrum .",
    "my purpose here was to check whether such dependence on redshift can be reproduced by sim .",
    "the improved sim can be generalized to obtain the dependence on @xmath10 in a straighforward way by asuming that the collapse time of the halo is not the present epoch , but is equal to the age of universe at @xmath10 .",
    "other quantities , like the critical density , the proper virial radius or the mass of the halo , have to be changed accordingly to incorporate the dependence on redshift .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ koncz ] shows the dependence of @xmath12 on the mass of the halo expressed in units of the present nonlinear mass @xmath13 for the present epoch , @xmath14 , and at @xmath15 .",
    "all results were obtained for @xmath8 and scale - free power spectrum of index @xmath16 .",
    "the lines bending at larger masses show the sim results for initial redshifts between @xmath17 and @xmath18 while the almost straight ones correspond to the nfw results or the toy model proposed by them to describe the dependence on @xmath10 .",
    "the nfw results are shown in the same range of masses as obtained in sim .",
    "the right panel of the figure repeats the @xmath15 results and shows also predictions for @xmath12 at @xmath15 calculated with assumptions that @xmath19 ( thinner dotted lines ) or @xmath20 ( thicker dotter line only for sim results ) , where @xmath21 .",
    "the figure shows that the nfw results indeed behave as observed by bullock et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ( the dashed and dotted straight lines overlap ) while the sim results are reproduced better by the @xmath22 behaviour of the concentration parameter .",
    "similar dependence on redshift is found for other values of @xmath10 .",
    "therefore sim reproduces only qualitatively the redshift dependence of the shape of the profiles found in @xmath1-body simulations .",
