    "fragmentation of quarks and gluons into hadrons is an important subject for which qcd , in both the soft and hard regions , should be applicable .",
    "because of the entanglement of both of these regions , it is difficult to calculate fragmentation functions @xmath4 .",
    "however , when fragmentation involves heavy flavor quarks and hadrons the situation is clearer  factorization of the soft and hard parts can obtain .",
    "heavy quark physics lends itself to perturbative qcd .",
    "the calculations are considerably simplified by the peculiar feature of heavy physics just as in atomic physics , where the presence of the heavy nucleus , with a mass much larger than the average momentum transfer inside of the system , effectively reduces the number of the degrees of freedom .",
    "a heavy quark or a heavy atomic nucleus can be considered effectively immobile . of course",
    ", such a description is vitiated as soon as the momentum transfers become of the order of the heavy mass , but then an expansion in powers of the inverse mass works well  @xcite .    until recent years",
    ", heavy quark fragmentation functions have been outside the scope of experimental verification .",
    "theoretical predictions for fragmentation into light flavor baryons have been based on a range of phenomenological models  @xcite and monte - carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , spin dependent fragmentation functions were put on a firm foundation employing light - cone field theory  @xcite and the theoretical implications of the heavy quark effective theory were incorporated  @xcite . as these developments occurred it",
    "was realized that the masses of the heavy flavor quarks allow for perturbative calculations in the case of the doubly heavy mesons  @xcite .",
    "later we extended these calculations to include the heavy quark fragmentation of baryons  @xcite .",
    "( at the same time a russian group  @xcite made a similar extension to baryons .",
    "more recently the light cone expansion of the fragmentation functions was used by the amsterdam group  @xcite with an algebraic model to generate predictions similar to ours . )",
    "the results of our phenomenological approach were interesting for several reasons .",
    "working in the rather general parameter space we obtained the result that the direct production rate of the spin excited baryons is on the order of or higher than that of the ground state baryons of the same flavor  @xcite .",
    "we also found a functional dependence quite distinct from the simple peterson parameterization  @xcite .",
    "that excited baryon result may turn out to be a sensible way to explain the tendency seen throughout the scarce experimental data to indicate the high depolarization of the heavy flavor baryons .",
    "if most of the singly heavy baryons are produced in the ground state , then fragmentation can be seen as the heavy quark picking up a couple of light sea quarks .",
    "since the momentum transfers associated with the quark fragmentation are not large enough to make the heavy quark flip its spin , the expected depolarization is minimal , i.e. the spin of the heavy baryon is expected to be nearly the same as that of the heavy quark . however",
    ", if we include spin excited baryons into consideration , the resulting polarization of the final baryon is less clear .",
    "the excited states will decay strongly into the ground state almost entirely via pion emission ( with the exception of one radiative decay for the @xmath5 ) and mix with the directly fragmented sample .",
    "it is our purpose herein to explore the fragmentation into excited heavy baryons which then decay and populate the observable ground state fragmentation .",
    "since we are interested in the spin dependent fragmentation functions for ground state heavy baryons , the intermediate state resonance production will have a significant effect . in the next section we present the particulars of the model calculation , incorporating qcd , heavy quark approximations and the quark - diquark model of the baryons .",
    "the spin dependent functions are developed and discussed in the following section , including the relevant baryon wave functions in the quark - diquark model , along with the comparison with data , where available .",
    "the final section discusses the implications of these results in a broader context .",
    "an appendix presents the many scalar products that arise in the final sum over states .",
    "the indirect fragmentation process is shown in the fig .  [",
    "fig : diagram ] .",
    "the heavy quark emits a hard gluon that splits into the diquark pair .",
    "diquarks can be either scalar or vector , with the vector diquark having the larger mass ( as suggested by the nucleon-@xmath6 mass difference ) .",
    "if the diquark is scalar , the heavy quark forms a ground state spin @xmath7 baryon with it . since the scalar diquark is spinless and the ground state has no orbital angular momentum , the heavy baryon has nearly the same helicity as the heavy quark .",
    "vector diquarks have spin 1 and the resulting helicity of the baryon is not the same as that of the single heavy quark , but naturally depends on the helicity of the diquark .",
    "that does not produce any depolarization of the heavy quark by itself - the heavy quark inside of the baryon does not change its helicity .",
    "however , depolarization may occur during the `` relaxation '' of the baryon into the ground state .",
    "the depolarizing features of the spin excited baryon decay into the ground state were discussed by falk and peskin @xcite .",
    "two parameters are crucial in determining the amount of depolarization relaxation .",
    "let @xmath8 be the mass splitting between the @xmath9 and @xmath10 excited states of the heavy baryon .",
    "so @xmath8 will be related to the spin - dependent part of the qcd interaction ( which has a scale determined by @xmath11 ) that , in turn , is responsible for flipping the quark spin .",
    "the excited baryon states lifetimes will be nearly the same , @xmath12 .",
    "the longer this lifetime is , in comparison to the time required for heavy quark spin flipping , the more likely it is for the diquark and quark to mix together forming a randomized quantum spin state .",
    "the time it would take for the heavy quark to flip its helicity is proportional to @xmath13 .",
    "the relative magnitude of these two parameters determines the nature of the decay .",
    "three distinct regions in the parameter space can be identified :    \\1 ) @xmath14 . in this case",
    "the heavy quark would not have enough time to `` mix '' with the diquark or light degrees of freedom and the ground state baryon helicity would be the same as the initial helicity of the heavy quark .",
    "\\2 ) @xmath15 .",
    "the decay proceeds very slowly , so the resulting ground state baryon is completely depolarized ..    3)@xmath16 .",
    "this is the case of partial decoherence , the borderline between cases 1 and 2 .",
    "it is important to note that the decay width @xmath17 is independent of the heavy quark mass .",
    "indeed , in a simplified model the decay may be due to the diquark and light degrees of freedom only .",
    "on the other hand the mass splitting @xmath18 is inversely proportional to the mass of the heavy quark .",
    "this shows that in the limit of an infinitely heavy quark mass there is no depolarization .",
    "however , for any given finite mass of the heavy quark all of the above possibilities may occur .",
    "there is very little experimental data on the absolute magnitude of the decay widths for the heavy flavor excited baryons , but theoretical predictions based on the heavy quark effective theory and potential models ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and the summary of falk and peskin  @xcite ) indicate that the decay width is of the same order of magnitude as the mass splitting for @xmath19 and smaller than the mass splitting for @xmath20 . that supports baryon relaxation as the source for the spin depolarization .",
    "we will return to this issue after presenting an outline of the calculation .",
    "we now proceed with the perturbative calculation of the fragmentation functions . for simplicity",
    "we will first consider the spin independent fragmentation function @xmath3 ( we use the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite but without the carat in @xmath21 ) .",
    "once the formalism is established and the calculations are made , it will be easier to turn to the case of the spin dependent @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the next section .",
    "the partial width  @xcite for the inclusive decay process @xmath24 can be written in general for any hadron @xmath25 as @xmath26 where @xmath25 is the hadron of energy @xmath27 and longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath28 relative to the parton _",
    "i _ , while @xmath29 is the arbitrary renormalization scale whose value will be chosen to avoid large logarithms .",
    "the function @xmath30 is the fragmentation probability in a paricular channel .",

    ", the high energy limit produces the same result . the expression , eqn .",
    "[ eq : general ] will be simplified if we restrict ourselves to the fragmentation channel shown in fig .",

    "then , while @xmath28 is kept fixed , the limit of large mass of the @xmath37 along with large energy of the heavy quark , @xmath38 , and the baryon , @xmath39 , yields @xmath40 and @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the decay width of @xmath37 into the ground state baryon and appropriate remnants - antiquark , spectator diquark and pion , while @xmath43 is the total decay width of the @xmath37 into the heavy quark pair  @xcite .",

    "the square of the denominator for each excited state propagator that enters the squared amplitude can be factored out for each decay channel and is proportional to @xmath62 .",
    "hence , in the limit of the small decay width to mass ratio , that factor can be approximated by @xmath63 , effectively putting the excited baryon back on the mass shell .",

    "may provide for corrections to our calculations , but the main features of the fragmentation should remain unaltered .    in our model the spin dependent fragmentation functions can be obtained directly , using the modified eq.[eq : ratio ] : @xmath124 with new indices specifying the spin alignment ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "angular integration is especially complicated for @xmath22 , because matrix elements involve spin projections that make them no longer azimuthally symmetric .",
    "naturally , the transverse spin vector would set a preferred azimuthal direction that manifests itself in the scalar products of the transverse spin vectors with other vectors that have transverse components .",

    "the longitudinal spin vectors are defined unambiguously by defining the four - vector in the rest frame of the particle with time component equal to zero and space component equal to the unit vector pointed in the direction of the lorentz boost that would take the particle back into the lab frame .",
    "the transverse spin vector ( transversity  @xcite ) has to be perpendicular to the direction of the lorentz boost and has zero energy component .",
    "it will not be affected by the lorentz boost , so it will still be perpendicular to the three - momentum of the particle even in the lab frame",
    ". the tip of the spin vector could be anywhere on the unit circle that has its origin at the base of the spin vector and is perpendicular to the three - momentum of the particle .",
    "the ambiguity is resolved by choosing the positive direction of the transverse spin of the final baryon to `` align '' ( or anti - align ) with the arbitrarily chosen positive direction of the initial quark s transversity . by taking the three - momentum of the quark to be along the z - axis and transverse spin direction to be along the x - axis",
    "the transverse momentum will be defined to be in the xz plane with it s x component positive .",

    "caution is advised in interpreting the cleo @xmath1 production data as a leading twist fragmentation function , given that the c - quark is being produced at half the @xmath162 mass .",
    "this is far from a large energy compared to the fragmenting @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath163 which is quite sizeable .",
    "the 45 gev spin dependent functions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : c_ev ] for completeness .",
    "corresponding results for the b - quark are shown for @xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ fig : b_no ] and  [ fig : b_ev ] .",
    "the @xmath2 fragmentation functions are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : xi_c_no],[fig : xi_c_5 ] and [ fig : xi_c_45 ] , for the unevolved , 5.5 gev / c ( for comparing with cesr data ) and 45 gev / c ( for comparing with lep data ) .",
    "it is clear from these figures that the unevolved functions are all sharply peaked at high @xmath28 and get spread out and smoothed out with evolution .",
    "the double peak structure noted for the direct production of the ground state heavy baryons in our previous work  @xcite has been moderated by the contributions from the excited states .",
    "the bound @xmath164 is satisfied  @xcite and nearly saturated , as expected in the heavy quark limit .    the overall rate for a heavy baryon state to be a fragment of the corresponding heavy quark",
    "is obtained by integrating @xmath3 over @xmath28 .",

    "the total fragmentation probability for @xmath2 is not given , although the fractional rates for different states are known  @xcite and were stated in our previous work  @xcite .",
    "the predicted overall net polarization transfer from quark to baryon is the integral of @xmath166 .",
    "for these we obtain @xmath167 for @xmath168 , respectively .",
    "the averaged value of the polarization measurements for @xmath0 produced at lep  @xcite are @xmath169 compared to the standard model expectation of @xmath170 for the b - quark polarization .",
    "so the value of net polarization transfer for @xmath171 is @xmath172 , consistent with our prediction of @xmath173 .",
    "note that our prediction is based on integrating over all @xmath28 , whereas the experiment necessarily emphasizes a narrower range of @xmath28 centered on the peak production region and there is some fluctuation of the value of @xmath166 in that region .",
    "it is known that heavy quark fragmentation into _ excited _ charmonium and bottomonium states contributes significantly to the high energy hadronic production of @xmath174 states  @xcite .",
    "the excited intermediate states do not make up completely for the overall theoretical underestimate of the cross sections for heavy quarkonium production ( color octet  @xcite schemes or alternatives are needed ) , but they are quite significant .",
    "the situation in the production of heavy baryons is less clear at this time .",
    "however , the observation of the depolarization of the heavy quark provides an opportunity to pin down the contribution of excited states and to compare the theoretical model predictions based on qcd with the experimental data .",
    "such an effect for the @xmath175 was first estimated by falk and peskin  @xcite .",
    "the heavy c and b baryons fall into their second or third category .",
    "the decay of the excited @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 or @xmath179 baryons is primarily due to pion emission ( with the exception of the radiative decay of @xmath180 as we discussed above ) .",
    "the experimental data on the decay widths are either unavailable or come with large margins of error .",
    "they can be theoretically estimated for the heavy baryons  @xcite .",
    "the results clearly indicate that the decay of the excited heavy baryons should exhibit at least partial depolarization .",
    "such depolarization is more important in the light of the results obtained in the direct fragmentation model  @xcite . since the number of the excited states that can contribute is large",
    ", they may very well pollute the final sample of the ground state baryons and result in an overall depolarization .",
    "based on general , model independent reasoning falk and peskin  @xcite estimated the amount of depolarization : @xmath181 with all heavy quarks initially taken to be in @xmath182 state .",
    "the parameter @xmath83 is the probability of producing the vector diquark ( versus the scalar ) ; @xmath183 is the probability that the vector is in the helicity + 1 or - 1 state .",
    "note that when direct production of @xmath175 is much bigger than the direct production of the excited states , as naively may be assumed to be the case , the depolarization is minimal . on the other hand ,",
    "the signature of our direct quark - diquark fragmentation model is the high ratio of the excited state production , which leads to a sizeable depolarization .",
    "the original investigation of excited state contributions by falk and peskin  @xcite was made without any dynamical details .",
    "what we have done here is to go a step further , with an eye toward future high statistics experiments , and to look at the dynamics of the indirect fragmentation .",
    "we used a perturbative calculation of excited baryon fragmentation and decay .",
    "the idea was simply to incorporate pion decay into the direct quark - diquark model .",
    "the basic premise of the model still involves a heavy fast quark originating from any high energy source , such as the @xmath37 decay . following that the quark shakes off the gluon that breaks into a diquark antidiquark pair . if the diquark has velocity similar to that of the heavy quark they fragment into the baryon .",
    "the diquark could be either scalar , and then the baryon produced is in the ground state ( i.e. @xmath175 ) , or vector , so that the baryon is in one of the spin excited states .",
    "now note that in falk and peskin the final net polarization of @xmath184 ( including @xmath7 and @xmath9 excited state contributions ) , obtained from eq .",
    "[ eq : lambdaratio ] is : @xmath185 that corresponds to the integral of @xmath186 over all values of @xmath28 . obviously that integrated value is not enough to pinpoint both of the parameters ( @xmath83 and @xmath187 )",
    "however , the net polarization of @xmath121 produced purely via decays of excited states ( direct fragmentation excluded ) is : @xmath188 using this expression to obtain @xmath183 we find :    for @xmath175 : @xmath189 .",
    "total polarization @xmath190    for @xmath191 : @xmath192 .",
    "total polarization @xmath193    in our previous paper we had @xmath194 for @xmath175 using the direct fragmentation function of @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "the results here are very close to this value although we used different techniques to obtain it .",
    "also , these results assume that @xmath187 and @xmath83 are independent of @xmath28 , which generally is not correct ( production rates may depend on the energies of the gluon and that can be translated into @xmath28 dependence ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath83 has not changed much from the last paper .    for @xmath175",
    ": @xmath195 .    for @xmath191",
    ": @xmath196 .",
    "the various fragmentation functions that have been obtained in our model have yet to be tested experimentally .",
    "the important features of those functions that should appear in the data include their overall normalizations , the resulting longitudianl polarizations , the ratios of the three spin dependent functions and the characteristic double hump dependence on @xmath28 .",
    "the functional dependence on @xmath28 distinguishes this model from the qualitative parameterization of the peterson model .",
    "the departure from a single sharp peak structure is a measure of the departure from the heavy quark limit .",
    "so careful measurements of the @xmath28 dependence of any of the functions , @xmath197 will be very revealing .",
    "in this appendix we list all relevant scalar products of two 4-vectors beginning with all combinations not involving spin . in each case",
    "we show the limiting value as the fragmenting quark s energy @xmath38 and 3-momentum @xmath198 become large .",
    "note that the intermediate quark ( momentum @xmath208 ) is taken as on - shell and the mass of the hadron ( momentum @xmath94 ) @xmath209 is approximately @xmath210 .",
    "hence @xmath211 .",
    "the quantity @xmath212 .",
    "hence :                evaluating this expression requires careful definitions of coordinate systems .",

    "let ( @xmath226 ) be the polar and azimuthal angles for @xmath227 .",

    "we can express @xmath49 in the primed coordinates as @xmath231 .",
    "the azimuth of @xmath232 in the primed coordinates is approximately @xmath233 .",
