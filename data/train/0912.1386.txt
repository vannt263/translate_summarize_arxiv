    "a photonic crystal , also called photonic band - gap ( pbg ) material , is a periodic medium which plays the role of an optical analog of a semi - conductor .",
    "such a medium has a gap in the frequency spectrum of electromagnetic ( em ) waves .",
    "the idea of a photonic crystal was first suggested in 1987 @xcite , and has since been intensively studied experimentally and theoretically ( see , e.g. , the recent books @xcite , the mathematical survey @xcite , the on - line bibliography @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "this interest has been triggered by the numerous promising applications of pbg materials , one of which is using photonic crystal for manufacturing highly efficient optical waveguides .",
    "the idea is to introduce a linear `` defect '' into a pbg material , and to guide through it em waves of a frequency prohibited in the bulk .",
    "numerical and experimental studies have shown that such superior guides can be efficiently created , e.g. @xcite .    in order to create such a guide",
    ", one needs to establish several facts .",
    "the first , and foremost , is existence of guided waves of frequencies in the band gap . the second , and",
    "an easier one , is confinement of these modes .",
    "this paper addresses both issues , by finding some sufficient conditions of existence of guided modes , and showing their confinement to the guide , in the sense of being evanescent in the balk .",
    "similar results were previously obtained by the authors in @xcite for scalar models ( i.e. , for acoustic analogs of pbg waveguides ) . in this paper",
    ", we will address the above questions for the full maxwell case .",
    "there is another important question to be resolved .",
    "namely , one needs to show that the impurity spectrum that arises in the spectral gaps due to the presence of a linear defect does not correspond to bound states .",
    "this difficult issue is not addressed here ( see some relevant remarks and references in section [ s : remarks ] ) .    in section [ s : prelim ]",
    "we introduce the main model to be investigated .",
    "the next section [ s : results ] contains formulation of the main results , with the proofs provided in section [ s : proofs ] .",
    "the paper ends with the sections devoted to final remarks and acknowledgments , as well as the bibliography .",
    "we start by describing the mathematical model studied in this paper .",
    "let @xmath0 be a bounded positive measurable functions in @xmath1 separated from zero :    @xmath2    it is usually assumed in photonic crystal theory that @xmath3 is periodic with respect to a lattice @xmath4 , but this is not required for our results .",
    "the function @xmath3 represents the dielectric properties of the bulk material . in other words",
    ", one can think of the space @xmath1 filled with a dielectric material with the dielectric function @xmath3 .    the unperturbed maxwell operator @xmath5 is the self - adjoint realization of @xmath6 in @xmath7 defined by means of its quadratic form @xmath8 with the domain @xmath9 .",
    "we use here the shorthand notation @xmath10    a cylindrical domain @xmath11 ( see fig . [",
    "f : strip ] ) will represent a linear `` defect strip '' : @xmath12 here the cross - section @xmath13 of the strip is a domain @xmath14 in @xmath15 ( e.g. , the unit ball centered at the origin ) , scaled with factor @xmath16 .",
    "we now introduce the perturbed medium with homogeneous dielectric properties inside the defect strip @xmath17 : @xmath18    the perturbed maxwell operator @xmath19 corresponds to the medium with the linear defect .",
    "it is defined , analogously to @xmath5 , as a self - adjoint operator in @xmath20 .",
    "the reader has probably noticed that we disregard the standard restriction of the maxwell operator to divergence - free fields @xcite .",
    "the difference is essentially in acquiring a huge eigenspace corresponding to the zero frequency , with all other parts of the spectral decomposition staying intact . since the problem of guided waves concerns the situation inside the spectral gaps of the operator @xmath5 , this difference is irrelevant in this case . on the other hand ,",
    "abandoning the zero divergence condition will simplify the techniques considerably .",
    "our goal is the same as in the paper @xcite devoted to the scalar ( acoustic ) case , i.e. to show that for any gap @xmath21 in the spectrum @xmath22 of the unperturbed medium , under appropriate conditions on the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath23 of the line defect , additional spectrum arises inside the gap , with the corresponding ( generalized ) eigenmodes being confined to the defect ( evanescent in the bulk ) .",
    "in order to formulate our first main result , we need to introduce the following quantity :    we denote by @xmath24 the lowest eigenvalue of the laplace operator @xmath25 acting on divergence free @xmath26-valued vector fields on @xmath14 with dirichlet boundary conditions on @xmath27 .",
    "i.e. , @xmath24 is the smallest number for each a non - trivial solution of the following problem exists : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the external normal derivative on @xmath27 .",
    "our main results are given in the following theorems .",
    "[ tm : existence ] let @xmath30 be a non - empty finite interval , such that @xmath31 ( we will be especially interested in the case when @xmath32 is a gap in the spectrum of the `` background medium '' operator @xmath5 ) . let the following inequality be satisfied : @xmath33 then the interval @xmath32 contains at least one point of the spectrum @xmath34 of the perturbed operator .",
    "this theorem guarantees that when ( [ em : condition ] ) is satisfied , eigenmodes of the perturbed medium do arise in the spectral gaps of the background medium .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath35 is such @xmath36 , the corresponding spectrum forms a @xmath37-net in the gap .    before one can fully associate these modes with the guided waves , one needs to establish their confinement to the waveguide ( i.e. , their evanescent nature in the bulk of the material ) .",
    "in order to describe the corresponding result , we need to remind the reader some notions and results about generalized eigenfunction expansions . here by generalized eigenfunctions one understands solutions of the eigenvalue problem , which do not decay sufficiently fast ( or do not decay at all ) to belong to the ambient hilbert space @xmath38 .",
    "one can find detailed discussions of generalized eigenfunction expansions , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "namely , as it is shown in @xcite , for the operator @xmath39 that we consider , for almost any ( with respect to the spectral measure ) @xmath40 in the spectrum @xmath34 , there is a generalized eigenfunction @xmath41 with the growth estimates @xmath42 for some @xmath43 .",
    "this system of generalized functions is complete in the whole space .",
    "for elliptic operators with smooth coefficients , this is a well known fact @xcite .",
    "we refer to the following growth condition as _ polynomial boundedness of order @xmath44 _ : for any compact set @xmath45 and @xmath46 , @xmath47    in the next result we will use the following notation : for @xmath48 , we denote by @xmath49 the _",
    "_ c__haracteristic function of the cube @xmath50 centered at @xmath51 .",
    "i.e. , @xmath49 is equal to @xmath52 when @xmath53 is in this cube , and @xmath54 otherwise .",
    "[ tm : decay ] let @xmath32 be a finite spectral gap of @xmath5 and @xmath55 be a polynomially bounded generalized eigenfunction of @xmath39 corresponding to @xmath56 . then there exist positive constants @xmath57 and @xmath58 such that @xmath59 where @xmath44 is the order of polynomial boundedness of @xmath55 .",
    "when the bulk medium is periodic in the @xmath60-direction , the polynomial growth in ( [ em : decay ] ) disappears :    [ tm : periodic_decay ] if @xmath61 is periodic in the @xmath60-direction , then one can find a complete family of generalized eigenfunctions that satisfies @xmath62 for any compact set @xmath45 , @xmath46 . in this case",
    ", for @xmath63 , one has the estimate @xmath64",
    "in what follows , the norm and inner product in @xmath65 will be denoted by @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively .",
    "we will show that if @xmath68 and @xmath35 is such that @xmath69 , there is spectrum of the operator @xmath39 in the @xmath37-vicinity of @xmath70 .",
    "then , taking @xmath71 and @xmath72 , one gets the statement of the theorem .    in order to show this , due to self - adjointness of @xmath39 , it is sufficient to find a vector function @xmath73 of unit norm , such that @xmath74    let @xmath75 be a smooth , unit @xmath38-norm , divergence free real vector field on @xmath76 with compact support in @xmath14 and unit @xmath38-norm , i.e , @xmath77 where @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "we define @xmath81 then @xmath82 is also a unit @xmath38-norm divergence free field .",
    "let @xmath83 have unit @xmath84-norm and @xmath85 for @xmath86 .",
    "clearly @xmath87 also has unit @xmath88-norm .    denoting @xmath89",
    ", we introduce the following candidate for an approximate eigenfunction : @xmath90 the function @xmath91 clearly has unit norm in @xmath92 .    instead of estimating the left hand side of ( [ em : approx ] ) , we will estimate + @xmath93 .",
    "taking into account that the function @xmath94 is supported inside the defect , the needed inequality ( [ em : approx ] ) can be also rewritten as @xmath95    using the identity @xmath96 and that @xmath82 is divergence free , we obtain @xmath97 where the norms are in @xmath20 .",
    "since the functions @xmath78 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 are real valued , their assumed normalization shows that the above expression is equal to @xmath100 since @xmath101 can be chosen arbitrarily large , the terms with the factors that are negative powers of @xmath101 can be made arbitrarily small ( uniformly with respect to @xmath102 on any finite interval ) .",
    "hence , one needs to control only the remaining terms by an appropriate choice of a divergence free vector field @xmath75 . in other words ,",
    "one is interested in making @xmath103 smaller than @xmath104 , i.e. @xmath105 while keeping @xmath106 under control .",
    "since @xmath107 where the _ infimum _ is taken over real , unit @xmath38-norm , divergence free vector fields @xmath108 , this condition boils down to @xmath109 which proves the statement of the theorem .",
    "we assume here that @xmath40 belongs to a finite gap @xmath32 of the spectrum of @xmath5 and @xmath110 is the corresponding generalized eigenfunction of @xmath39 satisfying ( [ em : growth ] ) .",
    "let us also introduce the resolvent @xmath111 .",
    "we will also use the function @xmath112 introduced before theorem [ tm : decay ] .",
    "we will need the following auxiliary statement concerning the exponential decay of the resolvent , which is a result of @xcite :    @xcite[l : resolvent_est ] there exists a positive number @xmath113 that depends only on the distance of the point @xmath40 from the gap edges , such that for a positive constant @xmath57 , the following estimates hold for the local @xmath114-norm of the resolvent @xmath115 : @xmath116 for any @xmath117 . here",
    "the norms in the left hand side are the operator norms in @xmath7 .",
    "we now consider the sesqui - linear form @xmath118:= \\langle \\nabla^\\times \\varphi , \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_0}\\nabla^\\times w \\rangle -\\lambda \\langle\\varphi , w\\rangle\\ ] ] with the domain @xmath9 .",
