    "low oi(63@xmath1)/oi(145.6@xmath1 ) ratios have been observed towards other pdrs and interpreted as the consequence of the self - absorption of the 63 @xmath1 line by the foreground gas ( lorenzetti et al .",

    "the emission of the [ siii ] 34.8 @xmath1 line is considered to arise mainly in the neutral part of the cloud , i.e. , in the pdr .",
    "silicon has a first ionization potential of 8.15 ev and remains singly ionized until an optical depth of a@xmath2@xmath6 5 , a value which is fairly independent of n and g@xmath11 . with a critical density of n = 3.4 10@xmath19 @xmath8 , the intensity of the [ siii ] 34.8 @xmath1 line is strongly dependent on the uncertain si abundance in gas phase .",
    "silicon is heavily depleted in the ism with logarithmic depletion values ( @xmath27 = log(x@xmath28/x@xmath29 ) ) ranging from -1.30 to -0.18 .",

    "the [ siii ] 34.8 @xmath1 line is usually compared with the [ oi ] 63 @xmath1 line because both lines have similar excitation conditions and their total column densities are fairly independent of n and g@xmath11 .",

    "all the pdr tracers peak towards the vibrationally excited h@xmath0 filaments located in the walls of the cavity in which the star is immersed ( the nw and sw pdrs ) while the siii emission fills this cavity and peaks towards the star .",
    "the intense h@xmath0 filaments observed towards the nw and sw pdrs show that the extinction from the star to these positions is lower than 2 mag .",
    "then , the siii emission is arising in the gas located at an extinction of @xmath3 2 mag from the star .",

    "this value is in agreement with pdr models if the assumed si elemental abundance is @xmath6 1.5 10@xmath30 ( @xmath27= -1.3 ) , i.e. , silicon is heavily depleted with only the 5% in gas phase .",

    "taking into account the dust and gas distribution around the star ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , this value can be considered an upper limit to the actual oi emission and we can conclude that the siii ( 34.8@xmath1)/oi ( 63@xmath1 ) line ratio is @xmath13 0.14 towards the star , i.e. a factor of 4 larger than towards the nw pdr . if the siii emission arise mainly in neutral gas , the si abundance in gas phase must be larger by more than a factor of 4 towards the star than towards the nw pdr , i.e. at least 20% of the silicon is in gas phase towards the star .",
    "even more suggestive is to compare the siii with hi emission .",
    "the siii / hi ratio presents a symmetric distribution around the star , in which the siii / hi ratio increases towards the star and is a factor of 7 larger towards the star than towards the nw and sw pdrs .",
    "if the siii arise in the mainly neutral layer traced by hi , more than 30% of the si is in gas phase towards the star .",
    "other possibility is that an important fraction of the siii emission arise in ionized gas which is not traced by the hi emission .",
    "the contribution of the ionized wind to the intensity of the siii line is expected to be negligible .",
    "we have carried out some model calculations using the code cloudy(ferland , 1996 ) assuming the kurucz stellar atmosphere for a star with t@xmath34 = 17000 k , log g=4 @xmath24 ( kurucz 1979 ) and the wind parameters derived by nisini et al .",
    "these calculations show that even assuming the solar abundance for silicon , the siii intensity in the ionized wind is expected to be a factor of 10@xmath35 lower than the intensity of the br@xmath20 line .",
    "alternatively , the siii emission could arise in a small hii region created by the star .",
    "the siii intensity in an ionized sphere around the star with constant density , n = 10@xmath36 @xmath8 , could be as high as 3.2 10@xmath22 erg s@xmath23 @xmath24 sr@xmath23 if all the silicon is in gas phase , i.e. , @xmath16 40% of the siii emission towards the star . in this case",
    "only the 60% of the emission observed towards the star would arise in the neutral layer traced by hi .",
    "but even in this case the si abundance in the neutral gas must increase by a factor of 4 to explain the siii / hi ratio .",
    "then we can conclude that silicon is heavily depleted for a@xmath2@xmath4 2 mag ( @xmath27= -1.3 ) and its abundance increases progressively towards the star where at least 20%  30% of the silicon must be in gas phase .    at this point",
    ", it is interesting to consider the case of the [ feii ] 26.0@xmath1 line .",
    "we have not detected the emission of the [ feii ] 26.0@xmath1 line towards any position .",
    "this lack of emission can be explained by excitation effects and a different depletion of fe and si on grains .",
    "the critical density of the [ feii ] 26.0@xmath1 line is an order of magnitude larger than that of the [ siii ] 34.8@xmath1 line ( hollenbach & mc kee 1979 ) .",
    "on the other hand , si is more easily released to the gas phase than fe .",
    "fe is expected to be significantly depleted in the hii region and the pdr although the si has been released to the gas phase ( sofia et al .",
    "1994 ) . in standard pdr models ,",
    "the depletion of fe is assumed to be a factor of 10 larger than that of si ( @xmath37= -2.0 ) and the intensity of the feii(26.0@xmath1 ) lines is then an order of magnitude lower than the intensity of the siii ( 34.8@xmath1 ) line ( burton et al . 1992 ) .",
    "it is well known that the abundance of gas phase silicon in the interstellar medium increases by grain - grain collisions and/or sputtering in shocks ( martin - pintado et al .",
    "1992 , caselli et al .",
    "1997 , bachiller & prez - gutierrez 1997 ) .",
    "photodesorption of si in grain mantles by uv radiation has recently been proposed as a mechanism to explain the large sio abundance in some pdrs ( walmsley et al .",
    "our data put some constraints on the efficiency of photodesorption to release si to the gas phase . in ngc 7023 ,",
    "si is heavily depleted ( @xmath27= -1.3 ) in gas at an extinction of 2 mag , i.e. , silicon is mainly in solid form in the molecular gas where the emission of sio is expected to arise .",

    "5 we show the rotational diagram of the h@xmath0 lines towards the sw pdr .",
    "note that the errors in fig .",
    "5 are entirely dominated by the calibration uncertainties ( 15% at 6.909 @xmath1 , 25% at 8.025 @xmath1 , 25% at 9.665 @xmath1 , 25% at 12.279 % , 20% at 17.035 @xmath1 and 30% at 28.219 @xmath1 ) .",
    "the data have been corrected for dust attenuation using the value for the dust opacity derived from the lws01 spectra ( a@xmath2 = 0.3 mag ) and the extinction curve of draine & lee ( 1984 ) .",
    "the extinction for the s(0 ) , s(1 ) , s(2 ) , s(3 ) , s(4 ) and s(5 ) lines amounts to 0.006,0.013 , 0.013 , 0.027,0.013 and 0.006 . like in the case of the nw pdr ( see fuente et al .",
    "1999 ) , the rotational diagram of the sw pdr shows that the ortho - h@xmath0 levels have systematically lower @xmath38 values ( where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the column densities and degeneracies of the upper levels of the transitions ) than the adjacent j-1 and j+1 para - h@xmath0 levels producing a `` zig - zag `` distribution .",
    "in fact , the ortho - levels seem to define a curve which is offset from that of the para - levels by more than a factor of 2 ( see fig .",
    "this offset can not be explained by calibration uncertainties and extinction effects .",
    "the calibration uncertainties are at most 30% .",
    "since the values of the extinction at 17.03 @xmath1 , 12.3 @xmath1 and 8.025 @xmath1 are very similar ( draine & lee 1984 ) , a correction for dust attenuation can not push the s(1 ) , s(2 ) and s(4 ) points to the same curve .",
    "this ' ' zig - zag '' distribution can not be due to the different apertures of the instrument for the different lines . in the case of a point - like source , the s(1 ) and s(2 ) lines should be corrected by a factor 1.35 relative to the s(3 ) line and the offset between ortho- and para- curve would increase .",
    "the \" zig - zag  distribution observed in the rotational diagram can only be fitted by assuming a non - equilibrium otp ratio , i.e. , different from the otp equilibrium value at the gas kinetic temperature . in this case , only the rotation temperature between the levels of the same symmetry constitute an estimate of the gas kinetic temperature . using the ortho - levels ,",
    "we have derived a rotation temperature of @xmath6 450 k between the s(1 ) and s(3 ) lines and of @xmath6 630 k between the s(3 ) and s(5 ) lines .",
    "for the para - levels we have derived a rotation temperature of @xmath6 430 k using the s(2 ) and s(4 ) lines .",
    "then we can conclude that the h@xmath0 rotational lines are arising in gas with kinetic temperatures ranging from @xmath6 400 to 700 k. these kinetic temperatures are similar to those obtained in the nw pdr , but the intensities of the lines are about a factor of 2 lower .",
    "a change in the incident uv field and/or the density would imply a variation of both the line ratios ( rotation temperatures ) and the line intensities .",
    "since the line ratios are similar to those of the nw pdr and the line intensities are significantly lower , we conclude that the sw pdr has the same excitation conditions as the nw pdr ( g@xmath11 = 10@xmath9 , n = 10@xmath7 @xmath8 ) but a beam filling factor of @xmath6 0.5 .",
    "all pdr models which include both , chemical and thermal balance in the gas , assume a fixed value of 3 for the otp ratio , which is the equilibrium value for gas kinetic temperatures @xmath13 100 k. in order to determine the value of the otp ratio in the sw pdr , we have corrected the intensities predicted by the model of burton et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for the effect of different values of the otp ratio assuming that the total amount of h@xmath0 molecules at each temperature and the line ratios between the levels of the same symmetry remain unchanged .",
    "this correction is only valid if the excitation of the h@xmath0 lines is mainly collisional which is the expected case for the low rotational transitions . in fig .",
    "6 , we compare the observational data for the s(0 ) , s(1 ) , s(2 ) and s(3 ) transitions with the model for g@xmath11 = 10@xmath9 , n = 10@xmath7 @xmath8 and a fixed otp ratio of 3 , and the same model corrected for otp ratios of 1.5 and 2 .",

    "because of the optical depth effects in the excitation of the ortho- and para- h@xmath0 vibrational lines , this value is just a lower limit to the actual value of the otp ratio ( draine & bertoldi 1996 , sternberg & neufeld 1999 ) . then we can conclude that the otp ratio is larger than 2.3@xmath260.5 in the less shielded layers of the pdr ( a@xmath2 @xmath3 0.7 mag ) where the vibrational lines arises .",
    "the gas kinetic temperature in these layers ranges from several hundreds to 2000 k. comparing the otp ratio derived from the rotational lines with that derived from the vibrational lines , we conclude that the otp ratio increases across the pdr .",
    "it takes values @xmath6 1.5 at temperatures of @xmath6 400 - 700 k and values close to 3 at temperatures @xmath41 700 k.    the same behavior , a non - equilibrium otp ratio for the gas with kinetic temperatures @xmath6 400 k and a gradient of the otp ratio across the pdr was found in the nw pdr by fuente et al .",
    "they discussed that the most likely explanation for this behavior is the existence of an advancing photodissociation front .",
    "an important problem remains in this explanation , the velocity of the photodissociation front required to have a non - equilibrium otp ratio is too large ( @xmath42 kms@xmath23 ) .",
    "however , since the expected behavior of the otp ratio in an advancing photodissociation front is in agreement with that observed in our data ( the cooler gas is further from the otp equilibrium value than the warm gas ) and there are many uncertainties in this estimate ( it is not known the otp ratio at which the h@xmath0 is formed within the pdr , the gas is clumpy and small dense clumps can be evaporating into the pdr , ... ) , we considered that this was the most likely explanation .",
    "later , lemaire et al . ( 1999 ) have obtained a very high spectral resolution spectrum of the h@xmath0 s(1 ) v=1@xmath100 line at 2.121 @xmath1 towards the nw pdr .",
    "the h@xmath0 line is seen shifted in velocity relative to that of the hi and the co rotational lines .",
    "they argue that this velocity difference is a clear proof of the presence of dynamical effects in this pdr and estimated a ( projected ) velocity of 1 kms@xmath23 for the photodissociation front .",
    "so far , very few models have been developed for non - equilibrium pdrs ( bertoldi & draine 1996 , strzer & hollenbach 1998 ) .",
    "these models consider regions illuminated by o stars in which a ionization front is combined with a photodissociation front and assume a fixed value for the otp ratio of 3 .",
    "they do not give any information about the effect of an advancing photodissociation on the ortho - to - para- h@xmath0 ratio .",
    "but they predict how the existence of a photodissociation front affects the thermal structure of the region .",
    "following the model by strzer & hollenbach ( 1998 ) , because of the advection of molecular gas through the pdr , the intensities of the h@xmath0 rotational lines and vibrational lines can be enhanced by a factor of 3 . assuming a velocity of 1 kms@xmath23 for the photodissociation front",
    ", the intensities of the h@xmath0 rotational lines observed in the nw pdr can be well fitted with a density of n@xmath6 10@xmath19 cm@xmath23 and a uv field of g@xmath11 = 10@xmath9 .",
    "a non - equilibrium otp ratio has to be assumed to explain the \" zig - zag  distribution .      towards nw pdr",
    "we have tentatively detected a weak line centered at 153.927 @xmath1 with a s / n ratio of @xmath6 3 .",
    "a weak line centered at 153.637 @xmath1 appears also in the lws spectrum towards the star position with a s / n ratio of 5 .",
    "taking into account that the spectral resolution of the lws at these frequencies is 0.6@xmath1 , both lines can be identified with the co j = 17@xmath1016 line ( 153.267 @xmath1 ) . however , since other co lines have not been detected towards these positions , we can not discard the possibility of a misidentification or a spurious detection . if confirmed , this line would implied the existence of a gas with t@xmath44@xmath13 200 k and n@xmath13 10@xmath19 @xmath8 in the vicinity of the star",
    ". however the density of the bulk of the molecular gas in the pdr must be at least an order of magnitude lower .",
    "federman et al . (",
    "1997 ) estimated based on the ultraviolet absorption lines of ch , ch@xmath18 , c@xmath0 and cn that the density of the pdr in front of the star is @xmath6 200 @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , the oi(63@xmath1)/cii(157.7@xmath1 ) ratio is consistent with densities of 10@xmath9 @xmath8 .",
    "we have not detected any oh , ch and ch@xmath0 line towards the observed positions .",
    "emission of the oh lines have been detected in several sources ( ngc 7027 : liu et al .",
    "1996 ; r cra and lkh@xmath20 234 : giannini et al .",
    "iso - lws observations towards a sample of 11 herbig ae / be stars shows that the oh lines are only detected towards the stars associated with with the largest mean densities ( n@xmath13 10@xmath19 @xmath8 ) as derived from the oi(63 @xmath1)/cii(157@xmath1 ) ratio .",
    "the non - detection of oh in this nebula is consistent with the idea that the bulk of the molecular gas is formed by the low density component traced by the oi(63@xmath1)/cii(157.7@xmath1 ) ratio .",
    "a similar situation is found for ch and ch@xmath0 .",
    "large ch column densities have been detected in absorption .",

    "( 1997 ) shows that the ch column density in front of hd 200775 is 3.2@xmath260.2 10@xmath15 @xmath24 .",
    "even if we assume excitation temperatures as low as t@xmath45 = 20 k , we should have detected intensities of the order of 10@xmath46 erg s@xmath23 @xmath24 for the 180.93 and 149.09 @xmath1 lines .",
    "the non - detection of these lines can only be explained invoking the excitation conditions .",
    "the beam filling factor of the dense gas ( n@xmath13 10@xmath19 @xmath8 ) is very low .",
    "another possibility is that the ch abundance decreases for high densities .",
    "this would also explain the lack of ch emission in other sources .",
    "in fact , far to our knowledge , emission of ch has not been detected towards any source ( just a tentative detection towards ngc 7027 ) .",
    "in this paper we present the iso - sws and lws observations towards a strip crossing the star and the most intense pdrs in the reflection nebula ngc 7023 .",
    "these observations altogether with previous maps in molecular lines and the [ hi ] 21 cm line have allowed to figure out a model of the nebula .",
    "we can consider the nebula as composed by three different regions .",
    "the first one is formed by the star , the small hii region around it and the low density gas filling the cavity .",
    "federman et al . ( 1997 ) based on studies of absorption lines derived that the density of the gas in front of the star is of a few 10@xmath47 @xmath8 . a slightly larger value , n = 10@xmath48 @xmath8 , was found by gerin et al .",
    "( 1998 ) based on observations of the co rotational lines towards the star .",
    "the br@xmath20 and [ siii ] 34.8 @xmath49 m lines peak in this region but the [ hi ] 21 cm and h@xmath0 rotational lines have a minimum in emission .",
    "the br@xmath20 emission is well explained as arising in the stellar ionized wind modeled by nisini et al .",
    "however , the contribution of the stellar wind to the intensity of the [ siii ] 34.8 @xmath49 m line is expected to be negligible .",
    "the [ siii ] 34.8 @xmath49 m line is better explained as arising in the diffuse gas filling the cavity in which at least 20%  30% of the silicon is in gas phase .",
    "the second region is formed by the walls of the cavity in which the star is immersed .",
    "clumpy pdrs have been formed in these walls with high density filaments ( n @xmath6 10@xmath50 ",
    "10@xmath51 @xmath8 ) immersed in a more diffuse medium ( n @xmath6 10@xmath52 @xmath8 ) .",
    "these high density filaments are located almost symmetrically @xmath6 50@xmath17 nw and @xmath6 70@xmath17 sw ( nw pdr and sw pdr ) from the star and constitute the peaks of the [ cii ] 157.7 @xmath49 m , [ oi ] 63.2 and 145.6 @xmath49 m , [ hi ] 21 cm and h@xmath0 rotational lines emission .",
    "the nw and sw pdrs have very similar excitation conditions although the sw pdr is a factor of 2 weaker than the nw pdr .",
    "this difference in intensity is very likely due to a different beam filling factor . in both",
    ", the nw and sw pdrs , the intensities of the h@xmath0 rotational lines can only be fitted assuming an ortho - to - para - h@xmath0 ratio lower than 3 .",
    "since the rotation temperatures of the h@xmath0 lines ranges from 400 to 700 k , this implies the existence of a non - equilibrium otp ratio in the region .",
    "the comparison between the vibrational and pure rotational h@xmath0 lines suggests that the otp ratio increases across the pdr from values as low as @xmath6 1.5 for gas with temperatures @xmath6 400  700 k to values close to 3 in the gas located at a visual extinction a@xmath2 @xmath3 0.7 mag ( t@xmath44 @xmath41 700 k ) .",
    "this non - equilibrium otp ratio has been interpreted in terms of an advancing photodissociation front .",
    "the intensity of the [ siii ] 34.8 @xmath49 m line observed towards the nw pdr is consistent with the predictions of pdr models with a standard silicon depletion of @xmath5 si = -1.3 , i.e. , only 5% of the silicon is in gas phase in these pdrs .",
    "the third region is the molecular gas .",
    "we have not detected the oh , ch and ch@xmath0 molecular lines towards this source .",
