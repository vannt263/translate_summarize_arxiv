    "consider a finite volume containing interacting particles and that is coupled at opposite boundaries to particle reservoirs held at _ different _ chemical potentials , as shown in figure  [ fig : chempotgrad ] .",
    "in this situation one anticipates a net flux of particles from the reservoir with the greater chemical potential through the system and into the opposite reservoir . after some initial transients we expect a state to arise",
    "in which there is a nonzero mean flux that is constant over space and time .",
    "this flux reveals the system to be in a _",
    "nonequilibrium steady state_. more generally , we have in mind any physical system all of whose observables do not change with time , but nevertheless exhibits an irreversible exchange of heat , particles , volume or some other physical quantity with its environment .     a channel held out of equilibrium through the application of a chemical potential gradient .",
    "it is anticipated that a nonequilibrium steady state will be reached in which particles flow from one reservoir to another at a constant rate . ]",
    "when heat , particle or volume exchanges are reversible , the system is at equilibrium with its environment and , as is well established , its microstates have a gibbs - boltzmann distribution .",
    "this knowledge allows one then to predict the macroscopic physics of a many - body system given a microscopic model couched in terms of energetic interactions .",
    "furthermore , these gibbs - boltzmann statistics emerge from the application of a very simple principle , namely that of equal _ a priori _ probabilities for the system combined with its environment .    by contrast ,",
    "when a system is out of equilibrium , very little is known about the statistics of the microstates , not even in the steady state .",
    "this is despite a wide range of approaches aimed at addressing this deficiency in our understanding of nonequilibrium physics .",
    "these approaches fall roughly into two broad categories .",
    "first , one has macroscopic theories , such as onsager and machlup s pioneering work on near - equilibrium fluctuations @xcite . in this regime , it is assumed that the thermodynamic forces that restore an equilibrium are linear , and it is possible to determine the probability of witnessing certain fluctuations in the equilibrium steady state , the most probable trajectory given by a principle of minimum energy dissipation . in this work ,",
    "we are interested in steady states that are far from equilibrium , i.e. , where the system is driven beyond the linear response regime .",
    "recently there has been some success in extending the onsager - machlup theory of equilibrium fluctuations to such nonequilibrium steady states , as long as one has been able to derive macroscopic ( hydrodynamic ) equations of motion for the system @xcite .",
    "furthermore , over the past few years fluctuation theorems have been derived under a wide range of conditions . typically , these relate the probabilities of entropy changes of equal magnitude but opposite sign occurring in a system driven arbitrarily far from equilibrium ( see @xcite for a brief introductory overview ) .",
    "although some connections between these various topics have been established ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , it is fair to say that a complete coherent picture of the macroscopic properties of nonequilibrium steady states is still lacking .",
    "somewhere between this macroscopic approach and a truly microscopic approach ( i.e. , one that would follow directly from some microscopic equations of motion ) lie a range of mesoscopic models that are intended to capture the essential features of nonequilibrium dynamics ",
    "irreversibility , currents , dissipation of heat and so on  but are nevertheless simple enough that analytical treatment is possible . in particular , it is possible to explore the macroscopic consequences of the underlying dynamics , in the process identifying both similarities with equilibrium states of matter and the novel features peculiar to nonequilibrium systems .",
    "it is this approach that is the focus of this review article .",
    "specifically , we will discuss a set of models that have a steady - state distribution of microstates that can be expressed mathematically in the form of a matrix product .",
    "we will explain in detail how these expressions can be used to calculate macroscopic steady - state properties exactly .",
    "these will include particle currents , density profiles , correlation functions , the distribution of macroscopic fluctuations and so on .",
    "these calculations will reveal phenomena that occur purely because of the far - from - equilibrium conditions : for example , boundary induced phase transitions and shock fronts . meanwhile ,",
    "we will also find conceptual connections with equilibrium statistical physics : in some of the models we discuss , for example , it is possible to construct partition functions and free - energy - like quantities that are meaningful both for equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems .",
    "we begin by explaining this modelling approach in more detail .      in figure",
    "[ fig : microtubule ] we have sketched some molecular motors ( kinesins ) that are attached to a microtubule .",
    "this is essentially a track along which the motors can walk by using packets of energy carried by atp molecules present in the surroundings .",
    "clearly , at the most microscopic level , there are a number chemical processes at play that combine to give rise to the motor s progress along the track . at a more",
    "coarse - grained , mesoscopic level , we can simply observe that the motor takes steps of a well - defined size ( approximately 8 nm for a kinesin @xcite ) at a time , and thus model the system as a set of particles that hop _ stochastically _ between sites of a lattice .",
    "this stochastic prescription is in part intended to reflect the fact that the internal degrees of freedom that govern when a particle hops are not explicitly included in the model .",
    "kinesins attached to a microtubule that move in a preferred direction by extracting chemical energy from the environment . at a mesoscopic level , this can be modelled as a stochastic process in which particles hop along a one - dimensional lattice as shown . ]",
    "the simplest such stochastic model for the particle hops is a poisson process that occurs at some prescribed rate .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be two configurations of the lattice that differ by a single particle hop .",
    "we then define @xmath2 as the rate at which this hop occurs , such that in an infinitesimal time interval @xmath3 the probability that that hop takes place is @xmath4 .",
    "the rate of change of the probability @xmath5 for the system to be in configuration @xmath0 at time @xmath6 is then the solution of the master equation @xmath7 subject to some initial condition @xmath8 .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side of this equation gives contributions from all possible hops ( transitions ) into the configuration @xmath0 from other configurations @xmath1 ; the second term gives contributions from hops out of @xmath0 into other configuration @xmath1 .",
    "we are concerned here with steady states , where these gain and loss terms exactly balance causing the time derivative to vanish .",
    "such solutions of the master equation we denote @xmath9 . in this work ,",
    "nearly all the models we discuss have the property that a single steady state is reached from any initial condition : i.e. , they are ergodic @xcite . given then that the distribution @xmath9 is unique for these models , we concentrate almost exclusively on how it is obtained analytically , and how expectation values of observables are calculated",
    ". the remaining models that are not ergodic over the full space of configurations turn out to have a unique steady - state distribution over some subspace of configurations .",
    "we will see that such a distributions of this type can also be handled using the methods described in this work .",
    "solutions of the master equation ( [ int : me ] ) can assume a number of structures .",
    "some general classes of steady state  not intended to be mutually exclusive  can be summarised as follows :    [ [ equilibrium - gibbs - boltzmann - steady - state ] ] equilibrium ( gibbs - boltzmann ) steady state + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    if the internal energy of a microstate @xmath0 is @xmath10 and the system as a whole is in equilibrium with a heat bath with inverse temperature @xmath11 , the microstates have a gibbs - boltzmann distribution @xmath12 .",
    "the dynamics is reversible in that the probability of witnessing any particular trajectory through phase space is equal to that of its time reversal .",
    "this then implies that stochastic dynamics expressed in terms of transition rates @xmath2 must satisfy the detailed balance condition @xcite @xmath13 where here @xmath9 is the gibbs - boltzmann distribution .",
    "a simple consequence of ( [ int : db ] ) is that there are no fluxes in the steady state .",
    "hence any system that does exhibit currents in the steady state , i.e. , nonequilibrium systems , generally do not have a stationary distribution that satisfies detailed balance .    [",
    "[ factorised - steady - state ] ] factorised steady state + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    sometimes , whether in or out of equilibrium , one has a factorised steady state .",
    "typically one has in mind a lattice ( or graph ) with @xmath14 sites with configurations specified by occupancy variables @xmath15 ( i.e. , site @xmath16 contains @xmath15 particles ) . a factorised steady state",
    "then takes the form @xmath17 .",
    "for such a structure to arise , certain constraints on the transition rates @xmath2 must be satisfied .",
    "for example , in an equilibrium system , one would need the energy of the system to be the sum of single - site energies .",
    "out of equilibrium , one finds factorised steady states in zero - range processes , in which particles hop at a rate that depends only on the occupation number at the departure site .",
    "moreover , necessary and sufficient conditions for factorisation in a broad class of models which includes the zrp have been established @xcite .",
    "zero - range processes and various generalisations have been reviewed recently in a companion paper @xcite and so we do not discuss them further here .",
    "[ [ matrix - product - steady - state ] ] matrix product steady state + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    a matrix product steady state is an extension to a factorised steady state that is of particular utility for one - dimensional models .",
    "the rough idea is to replace the scalar factors @xmath18 with matrices @xmath19 , the steady state probability then being given by an element of the resulting matrix product @xmath20 . since the matrices @xmath21 for different occupancy numbers @xmath22 need not commute , one opens up the possibility for correlations between the occupancy of different sites ( above those that emerge from global constraints , such as a fixed particle number , that one sees in factorised states ) .",
    "it turns out that quite a number of nonequilibrium models have a matrix product steady state , and we will encounter them all in the course of this review .    [ [ most - general - steady - state ] ] most general steady state + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in principle , the ( assumed unique ) stationary solution of the master equation ( [ int : me ] ) can always be found if the number of configurations is finite , since ( [ int : me ] ) is a system of linear equations in the probabilities @xmath9 .",
    "one way to express this solution is in terms of _ statistical weights _",
    "@xmath23 , each of which is given by the determinant of the matrix of transition rates obtained by removing the row and column corresponding to the configuration @xmath0 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "to arrive at the probability distribution @xmath9 one requires the _ normalisation _ @xmath24 , so that then @xmath25 .",
    "this normalisation has some interesting properties : it is uniquely defined for any ergodic markov process with a finite number of configurations ; it can be shown to be equal to the product of all nonzero eigenvalues of the matrix of transition rates ; and it is a partition function of a set of trees on the graph of transitions between different microscopic configurations . in this latter case ,",
    "the densities of particular edges in the ensemble of trees are controlled by tuning the transition rates corresponding to those edges , so in this interpretation these transition rates are equivalent to equilibrium fugacities .",
    "although this interpretation of the normalisation is rather abstract , concrete connections between transition rates in certain nonequilibrium models that have a matrix product steady state and fugacities in an equilibrium ensemble have been made , and these we shall discuss later in this review .",
    "we also remark that the equilibrium theory of partition function zeros to characterise phase transitions also carries over to the normalisation as just defined , at least for those models that have been tested @xcite .",
    "we have three principal aims in this work .",
    "first , we wish to illustrate the insights into nonequilibrium statistical mechanics that have been gained from exactly solvable models , particularly those that have a steady state of the matrix product form .",
    "secondly , we seek to provide a self - contained pedagogical account of the various analytical methods and calculational tools that can be used to go from the matrix product expressions to predictions for the macroscopic physics .",
    "finally , we wish to present a thorough review of the progress that has been made using the matrix product approach over the last few years .",
    "as far as we are aware , the matrix product approach has not been the focus of a review for nearly a decade @xcite , and we feel that it is high time that the significant developments that have occurred in the meantime should be collected together in one place . in order to prevent this review from becoming unmanageably long , we focus purely on static physical properties exhibited in the steady states of models solvable by the matrix product method .",
    "this means we have unfortunately had to omit discussion of some very interesting topics , for example how some dynamical properties , such as fluctuation phenomena , have been elucidated through the use of the bethe ansatz @xcite , determinental solutions and their connection to random matrix theory @xcite and dynamical matrix products@xcite .",
    "some of these topics , however , have recently been reviewed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we also direct the reader to established reviews , such as @xcite , for any other background that we have been forced to leave out here .    to realise the aims stated above , we provide in the next section a general account of",
    "the physics one expects to see in nonequilibrium dynamical systems , and outline the essential ideas underlying the matrix product approach .",
    "thereafter , we go into the details of how the simplest models are solved , and show a number of contrasting ( but equivalent ) approaches that have found application to more complex problems .",
    "these cases then form the material of the remainder of the review , which we round off by posing some open problems for future research .",
    "the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) is a very simple model of a driven system in one dimension that has biased diffusion of hard - core particles .",
    "we shall discuss two versions : the periodic system and the open system .",
    "the latter is coupled to particle reservoirs at either end so that , as described in the previous section , there is a steady state with a constant particle flux .",
    "the open system has a long history , having first appeared in the literature to our knowledge as a model of biopolymerisation @xcite and transport across membranes @xcite . in the mathematical literature",
    "meanwhile diffusion with collisions between particles was first studied by harris @xcite and the terminology simple exclusion was first defined by spitzer @xcite . over the years , applications to other transport processes have appeared , e.g. , as a general model for traffic flow @xcite and various other theoretical and experimental studies of biophysical transport @xcite .",
    "whilst interesting and important , these many applications are not our primary concern here . also we shall not do justice to the many rigorous mathematical results which have been summarised in the books by liggett@xcite . rather , our interest in the asep lies in its having acquired the status of a fundamental model of nonequilibrium statistical physics in its own right in much the same way that the ising model has become a paradigm for equilibrium critical phenomena .",
    "in particular , the asep and related models show  despite their superficial simplicity  a range of nontrivial macroscopic phenomena , such as phase transitions , spontaneous symmetry breaking , shock fronts , condensation and jamming .    in common with the vast majority of the models we discuss in this review , the asep is defined as a stochastic process taking place in continuous time on a discrete one - dimensional lattice of @xmath14 sites .",
    "hopping is totally asymmetric : a particle sitting to the left of an occupied site hops forwards one site ( as in figure  [ fig : microtubule ] ) , each hop being a poisson process with rate @xmath26 .",
    "that is , in an infinitesimal time interval @xmath3 , there is a probability @xmath27 that one of the particles that can hop , does hop , the identity of that particle being chosen at random . in simulation terms",
    ", this type of dynamics corresponds to a _ random - sequential _ updating scheme , in which bonds between particles are chosen at random and then , if there is a particle at the left - hand end of the bond and a vacancy at the right , the particle is moved forwards . in this scheme ,",
    "each update corresponds ( on average ) to @xmath28 units of time ; in the following we take @xmath29 without loss of generality . the definition of the model is completed by specifying the boundary conditions .     asymmetric exclusion process with ( a ) periodic and ( b ) open boundary conditions .",
    "the labels indicate the rates at which the various particle moves can occur . ]",
    "the simplest version of the model has a ring of @xmath14 sites as depicted in figure  [ fig : asep](a ) : a particle hopping to the right on site @xmath14 lands on site @xmath30 if the receiving site is empty . under these dynamics",
    ", the total particle number @xmath31 is conserved .",
    "furthermore , as we will show in section  [ rrproof ] , the steady state is very simple : all configurations ( with the allowed number of particles ) are equally likely .",
    "as there are @xmath32 allowed configurations the probability of any one is @xmath33 .",
    "the steady - state current of particles , @xmath34 , through a bond @xmath35 is given by @xmath26 ( here equal to 1 ) multiplied by the probability that there is a particle at site @xmath16 and site @xmath36 is vacant .",
    "one finds @xmath37 in the thermodynamic limit where @xmath38 at a constant ratio @xmath39 .",
    "one may also ask , starting from a known configuration , how long the system takes to relax to the steady state .",
    "it turns out that this timescale @xmath40 depends on the system size @xmath14 via the relation @xmath41 which defines a _ dynamic exponent _ @xmath42 .",
    "one can show using the bethe ansatz ( not covered here , but see , e.g. , @xcite ) that for the asep on a ring , @xmath43 .",
    "also in the symmetric case where particles hop both to the left and to the right with equal rates , but still with exclusion , one obtains @xmath44 which is the value one would find for a purely diffusive process .      to model the interaction of an open system with reservoirs at different densities , poisson processes acting at the boundary sites are added .",
    "specifically , a particle may be inserted onto the leftmost site with rate @xmath45 ( if it is vacant ) , and may leave the system from the rightmost site at rate @xmath11 : see figure  [ fig : asep](b ) . here",
    "we will consider only @xmath45 , @xmath46 although there is no problem in considering rates outwith this range",
    ". then we may think of reservoirs at site 0 with density @xmath45 and a reservoir at site @xmath47 with density @xmath48 . to include these moves in the simulation scheme described above",
    ", one would additionally allow the bonds between the system and the reservoirs to be chosen , and perform the particle updates with probability @xmath45 ( entry ) or @xmath11 ( exit ) according to the bond chosen ( assuming @xmath45 and @xmath11 both less than @xmath30 ) .",
    "these moves admit the possibility of a nonzero current in the steady state .",
    "the open system is more interesting in that phase transitions may occur in the steady state . in the following",
    "we shall explore the origins of these phase transitions , both through approximate treatments and an exact solution . in this context",
    "we recognise  by direct analogy with equilibrium phase transitions  a phase transition as a sudden change in form of macroscopic quantities such as the particle current across a bond , or the density at a site .",
    "it turns out that the particle current plays a central role , analogous to the free energy of an equilibrium system , in determining the nature of the phase transition i.e. the order of the transition is determined by which derivative of the current with respect to some external parameter exhibits a discontinuity .",
    "we remark that other types of updating scheme can also be considered .",
    "for example , in applications to traffic flow or pedestrian dynamics",
    "@xcite , it is more natural to consider parallel dynamics where many particles can hop in concert . the asep remains solvable under certain classes of parallel updating schemes which will be discussed towards the end of this review ( section  [ discretetime ] ) .",
    "we begin by reviewing a classical phenomenological theory , first applied to traffic flow @xcite , which serves as a first recourse in our understanding of the phase diagrams of driven diffusive systems .",
    "the idea is to postulate a continuity equation for the local density @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath34 is the current of particles .",
    "( note we use here a different nomenclature and notation to @xcite which discusses concentration and flow rather density and current . )",
    "the analysis rests on the key assumption that there is a unique relation , @xmath51 , between the current and local density .",
    "also , it is assumed that there is a maximum current @xmath52 ( the capacity of the road ) at density @xmath53 .",
    "the first assumption implies that ( [ cty ] ) becomes @xmath54 where @xmath55 now , an implicit solution of ( [ cty2 ] ) is of travelling - wave form @xmath56 as can readily be checked by substitution into ( [ cty2 ] ) .",
    "the arbitrary function @xmath57 is determined by the initial density profile @xmath58 .",
    "the interpretation of the solution is that a patch with local density @xmath49 propagates with velocity @xmath59 .",
    "the propagation of such a patch is known as a collective phenomenon known as a _",
    "kinematic wave _ and @xmath60 is a group velocity .",
    "the velocity @xmath61 of a single particle in an environment of density @xmath49 , on the other hand , is defined through @xmath62 one sees that @xmath63 thus , if the single particle velocity is a decreasing function of density , which is what we expect , we find @xmath64 and kinematic waves travel backwards in the frame of a moving particle .",
    "kinematic waves and sharpening of a shock : the figure sketches the evolution of a density profile @xmath65 from an initial profile @xmath66 according to ( [ cty ] ) and illustrates how sharp discontinuities in the profile may develop ( see text for discussion ) . ]",
    "if @xmath60 is a decreasing function of @xmath49 we have the phenomenon of shock formation ( see figure  [ fig : kinematic ] ) .",
    "that is , since the patches of an initial density profile travel with different speeds , the low - density regions catch up with higher density regions and discontinuities in the density profile , known as shocks , develop .",
    "strictly , after the formation of a shock the description of the density profile by the first order equation ( [ cty ] ) breaks downs and one has to supplement ( [ cty ] ) with second - order spatial derivatives to describe the shock profile .    to deduce the velocity of a shock consider two regions of density @xmath67 to the left and @xmath68 to the right separated by a shock .",
    "mass conservation implies that the velocity ( positive to the right ) of the shock is given by @xmath69 note that if the current density relation has a maximum then one can have a stationary shock , @xmath70 .",
    "a particular form for the current density relationship studied in @xcite and which is relevant to the asep is @xmath71 in this case",
    "@xmath72 at @xmath73 and @xmath34 is symmetric about the maximum . expression ( [ jasep ] ) may be easily understood for the asep by noting that in order for a particle to hop across a bond , the site to the left must be occupied and that to the right empty . for a bond at position @xmath74 ,",
    "the probability of the former is @xmath75 and that of the latter is @xmath76 . assuming these events",
    "are uncorrelated ( which they are not  but we shall come to this later ) , we have @xmath77 .    in the case ( [ jasep ] ) one can compute the kinematic wave and shock velocities from ( [ vg],[vs ] ) @xmath78 where , as above , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the densities on either side of the shock .",
    "thus the kinematic wave velocity is negative when @xmath79 and the shock velocity is negative when @xmath80 .",
    "the kinematic wave theory can be used to predict the phase diagram of the open boundary asep , in which distinct steady - state behaviours are demarcated ( figure  [ fig : asepmfpd ] ) . the left hand boundary @xmath81 is considered as a reservoir of particle of density @xmath82 and the right hand boundary ( @xmath83 ) as a reservoir of density @xmath84 . associated with these boundary densities",
    "are kinematic waves with velocities @xmath85 in the case where @xmath86 and @xmath87 both kinematic waves propagate into the system .",
    "so , for example , from an initially empty system the kinematic waves of densities @xmath45 and @xmath48 will enter from the left and right of the system and meet somewhere in the middle forming a shock which then moves with velocity @xmath88 if @xmath89 the shock moves to the right hand boundary and density associated with the left hand boundary , @xmath82 , is adopted throughout the bulk of the system . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath90 the shock moves to the left hand boundary and density associated with the right hand boundary , @xmath84 , is adopted throughout the bulk of the system .    in the case",
    "@xmath91 , @xmath70 and the shock is stationary . in the stochastic system",
    "the shock , although on average stationary , diffuses around the system and effectively reflects off the boundaries .",
    "the result is that the shock is equally likely to be anywhere in the system .    in the case where one of @xmath45 or @xmath92 , the kinematic wave associated with that boundary does not propagate into the system and the kinematic wave which does propagate from the other boundary controls the bulk density .",
    "thus , the boundary with @xmath45 or @xmath93 controls the bulk density    finally if both @xmath45 , @xmath94 .",
    "the kinematic waves from both boundaries do not penetrate . to describe this phase one needs to add a diffusive contribution to the current ( [ jasep ] ) i.e. to consider second - order spatial derivative of @xmath49 which we shall do in the next section .",
    "the result is that steady state of the system has density @xmath95 ; the system adopts the maximal current density @xmath73 which is the density associated with kinematic wave velocity zero .",
    "the resulting bulk densities and currents are then as shown in table  [ tab : asepmf ] which corresponds to the phase diagram given in figure  [ fig : asepmfpd ] .",

    "as we previously noted , the case where @xmath146 is of interest since then the particles in the bulk prefer to hop to the left , even though the boundary conditions enforce a current that flows in the opposite direction .",
    "although the @xmath96-hermite polynomials have an extension to @xmath146 @xcite it is unclear how to handle the resulting integral representation of the normalisation and other matrix product expressions @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach , followed in @xcite , is to note that , if one were actually to evaluate the integral ( [ pasep : zint ] ) by performing , say , a laurent expansion , one would end up with a sum containing a finite number of terms .",
    "this is because this integral is another way to express the result of a direct reordering using the reduction relations ( [ pasep : de])([pasep : ew ] ) , a procedure that is known to terminate .",
    "such an expression is then valid for any @xmath96 , not just @xmath145 as was required to derive the integral representation in the first place . in other words",
    ", we can access the asymptotics for @xmath146 by first fixing @xmath14 at some finite value with @xmath145 , put @xmath146 in the result and only then at the very end take @xmath147 .",
    "it is possible , using a clutch of identities from the theory of @xmath96-series , to find the finite sum implied by ( [ pasep : zint ] ) @xcite .",
    "we do not quote this formula  a complicated mixture of ordinary and @xmath96-combinatorial factors  here .",
    "rather , we simply state that the leading term in the normalisation for @xmath146 is , for large @xmath14 @xcite , @xmath148 where @xmath149 is a function that is independent of @xmath14 .",
    "note that this result holds for all values of @xmath45 and @xmath11 : there is only one reverse - bias phase . for ( [ pasep : j ] )",
    "we see that in this phase , the current vanishes asymptotically as @xmath150    although the density profile in the reverse bias phase has not been calculated explicitly , one can conjecture its form using a simple argument .",
    "first we expect most of the particles to be in a domain by the left boundary , and most of the vacant sites by the right .",
    "now , if the interface between these particle- and hole - rich regions were closer to the right boundary than the left , a particle at the interface will escape from the right boundary in a shorter time than a hole from the left .",
    "therefore , in this instance the interface will tend to drift to the left . on the other hand , if the interface were closer to the left boundary it would , by the same argument , drift to the right .",
    "therefore , the lattice will typically be half full in the steady state , a feature noticed in computer simulations for small systems .",
    "we finally briefly mention the case of the pasep where particles may enter and leave the system at both boundaries , as shown in figure  [ fig : pasep ] .",
    "a representation similar to that used in subsection  [ alsalam ] was established in @xcite , where it was also shown that the functions appearing in the eigenvector of the matrix @xmath151 are a complete set of askey - wilson polynomials @xcite .",
    "these are a set of very general polynomials that contain both the al - salam - chihara and @xmath96-hermite polynomials encountered above as special cases .",

    "when @xmath146 the same three phases are manifested as the model is invariant under the exchanges @xmath163 , at least when all four boundary rates are nonzero .",
    "since the physical properties of these phases are very similar to their counterparts in the asep with open boundaries , we do not discuss them further here .",
    "further details , including an analysis of the bulk densities through the introduction of a fugacity as described in subsection  ( [ gce ] ) , are given in @xcite .",
    "as further shown in @xcite , the eigenvalue spectrum of the matrix @xmath151 can be used to determine density profiles and correlation functions .",
    "these show once again the universal power - law decay in the maximal current phase , and various exponential decays in the high- and low - density phases .",
    "in this review we have so far mostly concentrated on how the current and density profiles in driven diffusive systems are calculated from the matrix product expressions for the steady state . since one has to hand the entire stationary distribution of microstates , it is in principle possible to calculate any macroscopic quantity of interest .",
    "for example , the existence of a matrix product solution has recently admitted the calculation of the gibbs - shannon entropy in the symmetric exclusion process with open boundaries @xcite . in this section",
    "we take a closer look at a quantity that has received a great deal of recent attention in the context of open driven - diffusive systems , namely free energy functionals which characterise the probability that a deviation from the most likely density profile is seen in a macroscopically large ( but finite ) system .    to be more precise , we consider macrostates corresponding to a density profile @xmath75 where @xmath74 lies in the ( one - dimensional ) interval @xmath164 $ ] which contains some large number @xmath14 of lattice sites .",
    "as we shall see explicitly below , each macroscopic profile @xmath75 can be realised in number of ways that grows exponentially with the number of microscopic degrees of freedom @xmath14 .",
    "this exponential growth leads to the key property of statistical mechanical systems that in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath147 , one particular macrostate ",
    "let us call this @xmath165is very much more likely to be realised than any other ( except possibly at a phase transition ) .",
    "that is , the probability @xmath166 $ ] of seeing a particular macrostate behaves for large @xmath14 as @xmath167 \\sim \\exp\\left ( - n { \\cal f}[\\rho ] \\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath168 $ ] is a functional of the density profile that vanishes when @xmath169 . in an equilibrium system , @xmath168 $ ] is essentially the free energy of the macrostate , relative to the most likely profile .",
    "of course , in a nonequilibrium steady state , the probability of seeing a deviation from the most like profile can be measured , and so by analogy with the equilibrium case , we refer to the object @xmath168 $ ] that results as a free energy functional .",
    "progress in calculating such free energy functionals and related quantities has been summarised in the lecture notes of derrida @xcite .      in this subsection",
    ", we will sketch the derivation of the free energy functional for the nonequilibrium symmetric simple exclusion process ( ssep ) with open boundaries that has been achieved through the matrix product solution for the steady - state distribution @xcite .",
    "this version of the model has symmetric hopping of a single species at unit rate in the bulk , entry at the left and right boundaries at rate @xmath45 and @xmath153 respectively , and exit at the left and right boundaries at rate @xmath11 and @xmath152 .",
    "in other words , we have the dynamics illustrated in figure  [ fig : pasep ] of section  [ pasep ] with the bias @xmath170 .    in order to illustrate the procedure by which the free energy functional was first calculated in @xcite from the matrix product expressions",
    ", we shall follow it here for the much simpler case in which the model parameters are chosen so as to give rise to an _ equilibrium _ steady state . to find this set of parameters",
    ", we employ a kolmogorov criterion @xcite .",
    "this states that if , for every loop @xmath171 in configuration space , the equality @xmath172 holds , the steady state of the system is an equilibrium state for which the detailed balance relation @xmath173 also holds for every pair of configurations @xmath0 and @xmath1 between which transitions occur at nonzero rate .",
    "here we find that ( [ free : kol ] ) is automatically satisfied unless , in total , some nonzero number @xmath174 particles exits at one boundary and re - enters at the other to return to the starting configuration going one way round the loop .",
    "then , the ratio of the two products in ( [ free : kol ] ) is @xmath175 .",
    "therefore , to realise an equilibrium steady state one must have @xmath176 .    since the bulk hopping occurs at the same rate in both directions , the detailed balance relation ( [ free : db ] ) implies that all configurations that have @xmath31 particles on the lattice are equally likely in the steady state . by considering a pair of configurations that differ by the addition or removal of a single particle at the left boundary",

    "the reason for this is that when the system is divided into boxes , the joint distribution of box sizes and occupancy does not factorise as in ( [ free : boxes ] ) .",
    "that is , there are long - range correlations in the density profiles that are implied by the matrix - product structure of the steady - state weights .",
    "this makes evaluating the free energy functional by taking the appropriate combination of thermodynamic and continuum limits a much more complicated exercise .",
    "we therefore omit the technical details of the calculation here , referring the reader to @xcite for a full account .",

    "this procedure is similar to the use of the grand canonical ensemble described in section  [ gce ] , albeit with a much larger number of fugacities , and yields the generating function of the joint distribution that extends to the nonequilibrium case the expression ( [ free : boxes ] ) .",

    ", this implies that @xmath237 in this limit , yielding the desired equilibrium free energy functional , with @xmath218 equal to both boundary reservoir densities .",

    "the differential equation ( [ free : comp ] ) then implies that the second derivative of @xmath205 must vanish , which ( along with the boundary conditions ) results in the optimal @xmath205 and @xmath75 coinciding with the linear stationary profile .",
    "it is easy to see that then ( [ free : ssep ] ) is zero , indicating that this profile appears with probability @xmath30 in the thermodynamic limit ; it can also be shown @xcite that any other macroscopic profile appears with a probability exponentially small in the number of lattice sites .",
    "it is interesting to compare the magnitude of the free energy functional for a given profile @xmath75 with that for an equilibrium system that has the same stationary profile .",
    "this can be realised by coupling a one - dimensional chain of sites along its length to a series of particle reservoirs that have their chemical potentials tuned in such a way that the desired equilibrium density @xmath165 in a small interval @xmath211 $ ] is attained . since the equilibrium free energy density is local , the free energy functional for the whole system is obtained by summing ( [ free : eqmg ] ) over all these small intervals .",

    "this is not always the case however : a similar analysis for the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( see below ) shows that fluctuations can also be enhanced relative to the equilibrium state .",
    "a final further application of the free energy functional is to explore the optimal profiles in the nonequilibrium system after imposing additional global constraints .",
    "for example , one can ask for the most likely profile given that the overall density @xmath245 is fixed .",
    "it turns out @xcite that the the most likely profile has an exponential form and , unless the overall imposed density happens to be equal to the equilibrium density ( in which limit the linear profile is recovered ) , the density is discontinuous at the boundaries @xmath246 .",
    "free energy functionals have also been derived for the partially asymmetric exclusion process ( pasep ) in the case where entry and exit of particles occurs at the left and right boundaries respectively , and the bulk bias is to the right ( i.e. , the forward - bias regime , @xmath145 ) @xcite . in principle , one could follow through the procedure outlined above in subsection  [ hardway ] , where one starts with the full stationary distribution of microstates and takes the continuum limit .",
    "it turns out to be more straightforward instead to use the microscopic distribution to extend the additivity principle discussed in subsection  [ easyway ] .",
    "then , by the effective local equilibrium property , one can construct the full free energy functional as before .",
    "when the bulk dynamics are asymmetric , it turns out that two versions of the additivity principle come into play .",
    "one applies when the left boundary reservoir density @xmath232 is less than that at the right ; the other when the reverse is true . in both cases",

    "the fact that in one case , the additivity principle involves a maximum and in another a minimum has its origins in the nature of the saddle - point which provides the relevant asymptotics @xcite .",
    "we also note that the bias parameter @xmath96 does not enter explicitly into these equations , only implicitly through the relationship between the boundary reservoir densities @xmath217 and @xmath222 , and the microscopic transition rates @xmath257 and @xmath96 . specifically @xmath258 and so @xmath96 affects phase boundaries in the @xmath45-@xmath11 plane , as was seen in section  [ pasep ] .",
    "the @xmath96-independence of the free energy functionals does not contradict the rich structure seen in the density profiles in section  [ pasep ] , since the deviations from the bulk density at the boundaries vanish under rescaling in the @xmath147 limit .",
    "this lack of @xmath96-dependence also implies that ( [ free : ssep ] ) is not obtained as @xmath259 : in other words , the limits @xmath147 and @xmath259 do not commute ( as we have already seen ) .",
    "the free energy functional in the weakly asymmetric limit @xmath260 has been computed explicitly using the matrix product approach and on this scale a @xmath96 ( or @xmath261 ) dependence is apparent @xcite .",
    "closer scrutiny of these free energy functionals for the pasep @xcite shows similar properties to those seen for the ssep above in subsection  [ ssepprops ] .",
    "for example , one finds that the stationary profile ( here , a constant profile after rescaling in the thermodynamical limit ) is also the most likely profile , except along the boundary between the high- and low - density phases along which  as has been discussed before  there is a superposition of shocks with the shock location distributed uniformly across the system .",
    "then , any one of these shock profiles is found to minimise the free energy functional .",
    "again , one can compare the relative size of a fluctuation away from the most likely profile in the nonequilibrium system , and an equilibrium system coupled to a reservoir with a spatially - varying chemical potential .",
    "in the case where @xmath262 , it is found that ( as for the ssep ) , such fluctuations are suppressed ; however when @xmath263 the opposition between the boundary densities and the bulk bias results in these fluctuations being enhanced .",
    "a final interesting feature of the pasep is that density fluctuations in the maximal current phase are non - gaussian .",
    "evidence for this is provided by the existence of a discontinuity at a density of @xmath264 in the probability of witnessing a density @xmath49 in a box located somewhere in the bulk of the system . that the distribution is indeed non - gaussian is confirmed by explicit calculations for the totally asymmetric case ( @xmath137 ) @xcite that exploit the relationship to equilibrium surface models outlined in subsection  [ surf ] .      in this section",
    "we have seen that once one has found a function that is additive when two subsystems are connected together via a reservoir with an appropriate density , the distribution of density profile macrostates can be constructed given the existence of a local equilibrium property .",
    "this is an appealing approach , and one hopes that it can be applied to a much wider range of systems than exclusion processes .",
    "the difficulty is , however , that one does not know _ a priori _ what form the additivity principle should take : here , we have relied on the complete knowledge of the underlying distribution of microstates to construct it .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth remarking that the free energy functional for the symmetric exclusion process ( [ free : ssep ] ) has been obtained in a purely macroscopic formalism @xcite . in this approach",
    "it is assumed that , in the combined thermodynamic and continuum limit , the macroscopic density profile evolves deterministically as a consequence of the law of large numbers .",
    "then , it can be shown that the probability of witnessing a deviation @xmath75 from the most likely profile @xmath165 in the steady state is given by a functional of the most likely trajectory through phase space that begins at time @xmath265 at stationarity @xmath165 and is constrained to reach @xmath75 at @xmath266 @xcite .",

    "we are going to search for @xmath267-species exclusion models that can be solved using the matrix product approach . for clarity",
    ", we reiterate that in this work the number of species @xmath22 relates to the number of particle species , excluding vacancies .",
    "it is not known how to perform an exhaustive search of _ all _ possible matrix product steady states , but it is possible to search a restricted subset where the matrix products involved can be systematically _ reduced _ using expressions like ( [ int : de])([int : ew ] )  and ( [ ring : de])([ring : da ] ) . to this end , let us recall the proof of the reduction relations that applied for exclusion models on the ring geometry given in subsection  [ rrrproof ] .",
    "this proof concerned stationary weights that were given by a trace of matrices @xmath268 where the variable @xmath269 indicates the species of particle occupying site @xmath16 ( @xmath270 denotes a vacancy ) and @xmath271 is the corresponding matrix whose forms is to be determined .",
    "we showed that when @xmath272 is the rate at which particles on sites @xmath16 and @xmath36 exchange places , if one can find auxiliary matrices @xmath273 such that @xmath274 is satisfied , the weights given by ( [ 2s : f ] ) are stationary .",
    "if we are to obtain matrix reduction relations , we require that the auxiliaries @xmath273 are scalars ( rather than matrices ) .",
    "we must also insist that these reduction relations describe an associative algebra , i.e. , that no matter what order the reduction relations are applied , one always ends up with the same sum of irreducible strings .",
    "the various ways in which this can be be achieved were formalised , classified and catalogued by isaev , pyatov and rittenberg @xcite . in this section , we briefly outline the classification scheme for the the case of two particle species , @xmath275 , and show what physical dynamics the various possibilities correspond to .",
    "we then move on to discuss geometries other than the ring .      in this section",
    "we will mostly use the notation established above , where vacancies are denoted by @xmath276 and particles by @xmath30 and @xmath267 .",
    "occasionally , it will be helpful to state model dynamics using a natural `` charge representation '' , where particles of species 1 and vacancies are relabelled as positive and negative charges and particles of species 2 as vacancies : @xmath277 note that our notation differs from that used by @xcite .",
    "we will also use a shorthand for the transition rates @xmath278 and , since we are assuming the auxiliary matrices are scalars , we will write them as @xmath279 .",
    "we first restrict ourselves to the case @xmath280 , @xmath281 and @xmath282 , i.e. there are exchanges in at least one direction between particles and vacancies and between the two species of particles .",

    "as we have just described , the aim is to construct some dynamics such that the statistical weight of a configuration with @xmath31 particles ( one a designated species ) on an @xmath14-site ring is @xmath420 where @xmath421 are the matrices that give the steady state for some conservative process , and @xmath422 is a fugacity that controls the mean particle number @xmath31 . let us denote transition rates for this conservative process as @xmath423 , and the additional rates that serve to increase or decrease @xmath31 by one as @xmath424 .",

    "the second and third summations can be made to vanish if we choose @xmath427 where @xmath428 and @xmath429 are the site occupation variables specifying to configurations @xmath0 and @xmath1 that have @xmath31 and @xmath430 particles respectively . as we can see",
    ", this takes the form of a detailed balance relation ( [ free : db ] ) .",
    "the two examples that follow serve to demonstrate .",
    "recall that in section  [ ring ] we considered a version of the asep with a second - class particle , i.e. , a model with dynamics @xmath431 this falls within the family of solutions denoted bii above . in the analysis of this model we introduced a fugacity @xmath422 as a trick to expediate calculation of statistical weights , tuning its value to yield the desired mean particle density on the ring in the canonical ensemble .",
    "this ensemble can also be generated using physical dynamics as we have just described .",
    "this is achieved by noting that the algebra let @xmath31 count the number of positive charges ( species @xmath30 particles ) .",
    "we note that the algebra ( [ biialg ] ) implies @xmath432 hence from ( [ dbens ] ) , we see that the grand canonical ensemble is realised physically if we introduce two non - conserving processes @xmath433 where the rates satisfy @xmath434 we remark that @xmath153 and @xmath152 as free parameters that enforce a particular fugacity @xmath422 in the grand canonical ensemble generated by these non - conservative dynamics .",
    "this particular implementation of a model with non - conserving dynamics was used in @xcite to generate a grand canonical ensemble dynamically .",
    "a second non - conserving generalisation of the asep on a ring with a second - class particle is best described using the charge representation . for simplicity , we take the dynamics of bii with @xmath29 and @xmath137 and take @xmath435 .",
    "the case @xmath107 was studied in @xcite .",
    "thus , the conserving dynamics are @xmath436 to these dynamics we seek to add the following non - conserving moves @xmath437 in such a way that the bii matrix algebra ( [ biialg ] ) can be exploited . to achieve this , we require matrices such that ( [ dbens ] ) is satisfied for the non - conserving moves",
    ". that is , @xmath438 where @xmath422 is a fugacity counting the total number of positive and negative charges . to make contact with more familiar problems ,",

    "we see that the previous equation is satisfied if @xmath442 i.e. , we require @xmath372 to be a projector .",
    "this is achieved using the matrices for the second - class particle problem of section  [ ring ] , ( [ ring : de][ring : a ] ) i.e. @xmath443 , where @xmath444 , @xmath445 and @xmath446 .",
    "the statistical weight of a configuration is then given by @xmath447 where @xmath31 is the number of vacancies in the configuration .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that an interesting phase transition arises as @xmath448 is varied .",
    "for @xmath449 there is a tendency to create positive and negative particles and this ultimately leads to a vanishing steady - state density of vacancies . on the other hand for @xmath450",
    "there is a tendency to eliminate positive and negative charges at the left and right boundaries respectively of domains of vacancies .",
    "thus domains of vacancies tend to grow and in the steady state this results in a finite density of vacancies .",
    "the transition is remarkable in that it is a phase transition in a periodic one dimensional system with local dynamics without an absorbing state . here",
    ", we shall use the generating function technique of section  [ gfa ] to quickly obtain the asymptotics of the partition function and hence demonstrate the phase transition .",
    "first , notice from ( [ noncon2 ] ) that configurations with no vacancies are dynamically inaccessible .",
    "therefore all configurations have at least one vacancy and we write the partition function as @xmath451 = w { \\langle w | } ( d + e + w a)^{n-1}{| v \\rangle}\\ ] ] ( an unimportant subtlety is that we have ignored the degeneracy factor in placing a given configuration of particles on the periodic lattice ; this factor is bounded from above by @xmath14 and hence does not contribute to the exponential part of @xmath452 which controls the macroscopic physics , as will be seen below . )    we introduce the generating function @xmath453 where we define @xmath454 .",
    "now , we may write @xmath455 where @xmath456 then using the generating function technique and ( [ znu ] ) we obtain @xmath457    the singularities of @xmath458 are a square root singularity at @xmath459 ( coming from @xmath460 ) and a pole at @xmath461 which only exists if @xmath462 . using the results of appendix  [ gf ] one quickly obtains the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath452 @xmath463    due to the form ( [ wweight ] ) of the weights , @xmath464 , the density of vacancies , is given by @xmath465 where @xmath466 is the average number of vacancies in the system .",
    "therefore we obtain @xmath467 demonstrating the phase transition in the density of vacancies at @xmath468 .",
    "in the previous section we identified all possible two - species dynamics that have a steady state of matrix product form with a quadratic algebra i.e. obeying relations of the type given by ( [ sqa ] ) .",
    "we deferred the discussion of two families of dynamics , as both can be generalised in a straightforward way to arbitrarily many species of particles .",
    "we now examine these cases in more detail .",
    "further discussions of multi - species quadratic algebras are given in @xcite .",

    "there are @xmath31 particles and @xmath469 vacancies on the ring of size @xmath14 .",
    "we give each of the @xmath31 particles an index @xmath470 , and introduce for each @xmath470 a pair of rates @xmath471 and @xmath472 so that the dynamics of particle @xmath470 are @xmath473 the corresponding matrix algebra is a generalisation of class cii of section  [ 2species ] to @xmath31 particle species .",

    "one possible representation of these matrices is given in appendix  [ appreps ] as equation  ( [ dmuealg ] ) .",

    "let the steady state weight of a configuration specified by @xmath477 where @xmath478 is the number of empty sites in front of particle @xmath470 , be @xmath479 .",

    "@xmath487 implies that the weights are @xmath488 \\",

    "an interesting phenomenon that may occur in this system is that of condensation . in that case",
    "the steady state is dominated by configurations where one particle has an extensive value for @xmath478 @xcite .",
    "this is easiest to understand when @xmath490 i.e. we consider only forward hops",
    ". then ( [ diss ] ) reduces to @xmath491 and we may write @xmath492 the weight ( [ bef ] ) clearly has the form of the weight of an ideal bose gas with @xmath493 . here",
    "the ` bosons ' are vacancies and the bose states correspond to particles with the energy of the state determined by the hop rate of the particle .",
    "the equivalent of the density of states for the bose system is the distribution of particle hop rates which we denote @xmath494 .",
    "if there is a minimum hop rate @xmath495 this will correspond to the ground state of the bose system . then",
    ", if for low hop rates the distribution of particle hop rates follows @xmath496 bose condensation will occur for high enough vacancy density or equivalently _ low _ enough particle density . when condensation occurs the slowest particle ( the one with the minimum hop rate @xmath497 ) has an extensive number of vacancies in front of it whereas the rest of the particles will have gaps in front of them comprising some finite number of vacancies .",
    "thus a ` traffic jam ' forms behind the slowest particle . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that the asep on a periodic system may be mapped onto a zero range process and the condensation transition is fully discussed in the context of the zero range process .",
    "recently , further progress has been made in understanding the case where @xmath498 by using extreme values statistics and renormalisation arguments @xcite .",
    "this is the generalisation of the two - species case aii , which had the two particle species hopping with different speeds , and the faster ones overtaking the slower .",
    "the many - species generalisation allows an arbitrary number of particle species labelled @xmath499 .",
    "a particle of species @xmath470 has a forward hop rate or ` velocity ' @xmath500 , and adjacent particles @xmath470 and @xmath501 exchange places with rate @xmath502 if @xmath503 , i.e. , @xmath504 the model provides an elegant generalisation of the open boundary tasep and its algebra .",
    "the generalisation of ( [ aiialg ] ) to the multispecies case is @xmath505 writing @xmath506 , @xmath507 and making the convenient choice @xmath331 , @xmath508 for @xmath509 yields @xmath510 on a periodic lattice the relations ( [ kalg ] ) are the only ones which need be satisfied and this can be done by choosing a scalar representation @xmath511 and @xmath512 where @xmath513 is chosen to be less than the lowest hop rate",
    ". thus on a ring all allowed configurations are equally likely .",
    "more interestingly , the relations ( [ msalg1 ] ) may be used for an open system with suitable boundary conditions . as discussed in section  [ sec : extop ] we require @xmath514 which with the above choice of @xmath411 and @xmath515 implies @xmath516 at the left hand boundary a particle of species @xmath470 is injected with rate @xmath517 if the first site is empty",
    ". the choice @xmath518 reduces ( [ alphaij ] ) to @xmath519 at the left hand boundary a particle of species @xmath470 leaves the system with rate @xmath520 .",

    "is needed to satisfy the boundary conditions ( [ kb ] ) ; see , for example , ( [ karimrep ] ) in appendix  [ appreps ] .",

    "therefore we can think of a reservoir of particles with velocities distributed according to @xmath524 each attempting to enter with rate @xmath531 . a particle reaching site @xmath14 exits with rate @xmath532 .",

    "recall that in section  [ algproof ] we set out a general cancellation scheme for matrices that guarantees a stationary solution of a master equation for a process on the ring .",
    "this involved a set of ordinary matrices @xmath421 and their auxiliaries @xmath542 . by restricting to the case of scalar auxiliaries",
    ", we showed , in the case of two particle species in section  [ 2species ] , that it was possible to determine all possible sets of dynamics that give rise to a matrix product steady state . in this section",
    ", we shall consider the more complicated case where the auxiliaries are matrices or more complicated operators .",
    "here it is not possible  as far as we are aware  to perform an exhaustive search for solutions .",
    "however , it has been shown that if one has a one - dimensional lattice with @xmath22 particle species , open boundary conditions and arbitrary nearest - neighbour dynamics in the bulk , there does exist a matrix product solution , involving auxiliaries that in general will not be scalars , obeying the algebraic relations set out in section  [ algproof ] . in the next subsection we review this existence proof which is due to krebs and sandow @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this proof does not lead to any convenient reduction relations , like ( [ int : de])([int : ew ] )  for the asep , that might be in operation , also , the proof is not constructive in that it requires the steady state to already be known in order to construct explicit matrices .",
    "rather , the proof demonstrates that there are no internal inconsistencies in the cancellation mechanism of section  [ algproof ] .    in the last two subsections we discuss two models of which we are aware that give examples of a matrix product state with matrix auxiliaries .",
    "the existence proof of a matrix product state @xcite ( see also @xcite for the discrete time case ) applies to models with open boundary conditions and arbitrary nearest - neighbour interactions .",
    "let us restate the master equation for a general process in the form introduced in section  [ algproof ] .",
    "it reads @xmath543 where the operator @xmath544 applied to the function of @xmath14 state variables @xmath428 generates the gain and loss terms arising from interactions between neighbouring pairs of sites in the bulk , and @xmath545 and @xmath546 do the same at the boundaries . here",
    "we shall consider models that have @xmath22 distinct particle species in addition to vacancies : i.e. , the occupation variables take the values @xmath547 .",
    "the matrix product expressions @xmath548 provide the steady state solution to ( [ formal : me ] ) for some set of matrices @xmath421 and vectors @xmath382 and @xmath383 if one can find a second set of auxiliary matrices @xmath542 such that the relations @xmath549 \\cdots { | v \\rangle } \\\\ \\label{formal : tilde2 } \\hat{h}_l { \\langle w | } x_{\\tau_1 } \\cdots { | v \\rangle } = - { \\langle w | } \\tilde{x}_{\\tau_1 } \\cdots { | v \\rangle } \\\\",

    "then , one obtains a zero right - hand side of the master equation ( [ formal : me ] ) via a pairwise cancellation of terms coming from ( [ formal : mp])([formal : tilde3 ] ) .",
    "thus , relations ( [ int : h3][int : hr3 ] ) for the asep generalise to @xmath550 relations ( [ ft1][ft2 ] ) give the general form for a cancellation mechanism involving matrix ( or possibly tensor ) auxiliaries .",
    "such a cancellation scheme has been proposed in various contexts @xcite including a generalisation to longer ( but finite ) range interactions @xcite .",
    "some consequences of this scheme have been explored in @xcite .    the existence of the matrices @xmath421 and @xmath542 and vectors @xmath382 and @xmath383 appearing in ( [ ft1][ft2 ] ) is proved by constructing them within an explicit representation .",
    "this representation has basis vectors that correspond to configurations of the rightmost @xmath551 sites of the @xmath14-site lattice .",
    "these we denote as @xmath552 .",
    "the vector @xmath383 is then ascribed the role of a vacuum state , and the matrices @xmath421 that of creation operators in such a way that @xmath553 one then defines the vector @xmath382 via the scalar products @xmath554 so that ( [ formal : mp ] ) gives the desired statistical weights .    the auxiliary matrices @xmath555 are defined as @xmath556 where the operators @xmath557 and @xmath546 are extended to the full space of all sub - configurations @xmath558 as follows .",
    "first , the bulk operator is defined in terms of the microscopic transition rates @xmath559 as @xmath560 when @xmath561 and @xmath562 , and @xmath563 under the same condition that @xmath561 .",
    "all other elements of these operators are zero .",
    "similarly , at the right boundary we have @xmath564 when @xmath565 , and @xmath566 with these definitions established , the relations ( [ formal : tilde1])([formal : tilde3 ] ) follow after some straightforward manipulations@xcite .",
    "let us take stock of this construction .",
    "we have seen that not only does the existence of a set of vectors and matrices that satisfy ( [ formal : tilde1])([formal : tilde3 ] ) imply a stationary solution of matrix product form of the master equation ( [ formal : me ] ) , but also that such a set of vectors and matrices can always be constructed _ once _",
    "one knows the weights ( [ formal : sp ] ) . as we previously saw in section  [ pasep ] for the pasep",
    ", one can find a number of different representations of the matrices @xmath567 and @xmath568 ( which correspond to @xmath355 and @xmath345 in the more general setting ) even when the auxiliary matrices @xmath569 and @xmath570 are the same . in the representation detailed above the auxiliaries are not scalars but rather complicated objects . hence we see that ( i ) there may be many choices of both the matrices @xmath421 and their auxiliaries that correspond to the stationary solution of a single master equation ; ( ii ) matrix reduction relations , like those found for the asep ( [ int : de])([int : ew ] ) , constitute only sufficient conditions on @xmath421 , @xmath382 and @xmath383 , since valid representations where these relations do not hold can be found ( that used in this section provides an example ) ; and ( iii ) the construction of the auxiliary matrices through the generators of the stochastic process in ( [ formal : xtilde ] ) does not necessarily imply the existence of any convenient reduction relations for the @xmath571 matrices that allow , for example , efficient computation of statistical properties .      as we saw in section  [ ring ] the matrix product state on",
    "the ring involves using a trace operation .",
    "the algebraic relations to be satisfied are given in the general case by ( [ ft1 ] ) .",
    "however , as we saw in section  [ 2species ] , sometimes it happens that , although the algebraic relations are consistent , the rotational invariance of the trace operation leads to global constraints on particle numbers .",
    "for example , in the abc model discussed in [ sec : abc ] we found that the matrix product state was consistent only for models in which the numbers of each particle species was the same .",

    "the hat matrices do not appear in the steady state weights at the end of the time step , rather they are auxiliary matrices which appear during the update procedure and move from right to left through the lattice .",
    "we conclude that backward ordered updating has the exact same phase diagram as sublattice updating , although exact expressions for correlation functions do depend on the details of the updating@xcite .",
    "finally the phase diagram for forward ordered updating can be obtained from the particle - hole symmetry mentioned above .",

    "also note that it is the occupancies at the beginning of the timestep which determine the dynamical events .    in this case",
    "the matrix product solution is of the usual form ( [ mss ] ) but the algebraic relations have a more complicated structure which was first elucidated in @xcite .",

    "in this work we have reviewed the physical properties of systems that are driven out of equilibrium , with particular reference to those one - dimensional models that can be solved exactly using a matrix product method .",
    "the most prominent physical phenomena exhibited by these systems are phase transitions which in open systems are induced by changes in the interactions with the boundaries , and in periodic systems by the addition of particle species that have different dynamics .",
    "additionally we have seen in a number of cases the formation of shocks in these one - dimensional systems .",
    "as we have also discussed , the matrix - product approach can be used to determine the steady - state statistics of models with a variety of microscopic dynamics .",
    "the majority of models that have matrix product states involve diffusing particles with hard - core interactions and whose numbers are conserved , except possibly at boundary sites . under such conditions , certain generalisations to multi - species models have been found .",
    "furthermore , there are a few cases in which non - conserving particle reactions can occur that also admit a convenient solution in terms of matrix products .",
    "however , it has to be said that the dream scenario , of being able to systematically construct any nonequilibrium steady state in matrix product form starting from the microscopic dynamics of the system , appears a remote goal .",
    "although the existence proofs discussed in section  [ formal ] tell us that a matrix product formulation should nearly always be possible , we are in practice still feeling our way with particular examples .",
    "there remain a number of simple physical systems that exhibit nontrivial out - of - equilibrium behaviour , but that have nevertheless been unyielding to exact solution by matrix products , or any other means .",
    "it is perhaps appropriate here to highlight some of these cases as challenges for future research .",
    "as was discussed in section  [ pwdis ] , it is possible to solve for the steady state of the asep on the ring when particles have different hop rates , as would occur when each particle is randomly assigned a hop rate from some distribution . as far as we aware",
    ", the corresponding dynamics with open boundaries has not been solved apart from the karimipour s model of overtaking which we reviewed in section  [ sec : karimipour ] .",
    "furthermore , if the disordered hop rates are associated with sites , rather than particles , even the model on the ring has so far eluded a complete exact solution .",
    "indeed , even if only a single site has a different hop rate to the rest , the steady state does not appear to have a manageable form @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , some nontrivial symmetries in the disordered case have been identified @xcite .",
    "one phenomenon that can emerge when disorder is present is phase separation .",
    "one sees this most clearly for the periodic system with particle - wise disorder , where as we noted in section  [ bec ] , a condensation of particles behind the slowest may occur @xcite . with site - wise disorder @xcite , a flattening of the macroscopic current - density relation @xmath51",
    "is seen ( recall that it is parabolic @xmath685 in the asep without disorder ) , and the densities at which transitions into a maximal current phase are correspondingly lowered @xcite ; it has been suggested that a linear portion in the @xmath51 curve may also provide a mechanism for phase separation @xcite .",
    "another interesting observation is that under site - wise disorder the location of the first - order transition for the asep becomes sample - dependent ( i.e. , the free - energy - like quantity for the nonequilibrium system is not self - averaging ) @xcite .      in all the models described in this work ,",
    "particles occupy a single site of a lattice . if one has extended objects on a ring , the dynamics are unaffected . with open boundaries , however , the situation changes and even if there is a single particle species and all particles are the same length , a matrix product solution for the steady state has proved elusive .",
    "although it is quite easy to arrange for cancellation of terms in the master equation corresponding to particles joining and leaving domains ( see section  [ rrproof ] ) , the necessary cancellation with boundary terms is much harder to arrange : it is not even clear what the most convenient choice of boundary conditions should be ( e.g. , extended particles sliding on and off site - by - site , or appearing and disappearing in their entirety , or a mixture of the two ) .",
    "a phenomenological diffusion equation for the macroscopic density profile in the open system with extended objects appearing and disappearing at both boundaries has been presented @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was conjectured in that work to be the equation that would result in the continuum limit ( along the lines of that taken in section  [ sec : mfh ] ) , if an exact matrix - product solution of this model were to be found .",
    "whether this should turn out to be the case or not , an application of the extremal current principle ( see [ sec : pd ] ) gives predictions for the phase diagram that are in good agreement with simulation data : the same three phases that emerge in the asep are seen , but with shifted transition points .",
    "meanwhile an approach to this problem based on a local - equilibrium approximation @xcite has shown excellent agreement with monte carlo results and have also been conjectured to be exact .",
    "the case of the open system with extended objects and a single spatial inhomogeneity in the hop rates has also been considered @xcite .",
    "the bridge model @xcite comprises oppositely - charged particles in the sense of section  [ 2species ] .",
    "positive charges enter at the left at rate @xmath45 , hop with unit rate to the right and exit at the right boundary at rate @xmath11 .",
    "the dynamics of negative charges is exactly the same , but in the opposite direction .",
    "when two opposing particles meet they may exchange with some rate @xmath96 .",
    "thus this model has both a parity and charge - conjugation symmetry . in certain parameter ranges ,",
    "this symmetry is reflected in the steady state that results : both positive and negative charges flow freely in their preferred directions . in particular",
    ", the limit @xmath686 at @xmath687 , for which an exact solution in terms of matrix products exists , is included within this range .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath11 is small the model s symmetries are found to be broken .",
    "this has been proved in the @xmath688 limit @xcite but there is no known exact solution for general @xmath11 . in a finite system , the current flips between the positive and negative direction , but as the system size increases the time between flips increases exponentially , and so in the thermodynamic limit only the state with positive or negative current state is seen .",
    "it is unclear whether the structure of the matrix product solution allows for the description of such symmetry - broken states .",
    "this may also be related to whether the boundary conditions correspond to particle reservoirs with well - defined densities @xcite      the abc model @xcite is another deceptively simple model that has yet to be completely solved .",
    "this model has a ring that is fully occupied by particles from three species , which are labelled @xmath372 , @xmath373 and @xmath151 and exhibit a symmetry under cyclic permutation of the labels .",
    "specifically , the rates at which neighbouring particles exchange are @xmath689 that is , if @xmath145 , @xmath372 particles prefer to be to the left of @xmath373s , @xmath373s to the left of @xmath151s and @xmath151s to the left of @xmath372s .",
    "this model was discussed in section  [ sec : abc ] and was shown to be exactly solvable when the numbers of @xmath372 , @xmath373 and @xmath151 particles are all equal as a consequence of detailed balance being satisfied . here",
    "a phase separation is seen when @xmath690 . if @xmath170 , on the other hand , all configurations become equivalent and the stationary distribution is uniform .",
    "when there is even the slightest imbalance and particle numbers _ and _ hop rates , a small current starts to flow and nothing is known about the properties of the stationary distribution .",
    "the model is of particular importance because in the special case of equal numbers of each species , it is one of few models along with the ssep and kmp model @xcite where a free energy functional for the density profile is known .",
    "we end by mentioning the original paradigm of a system driven out of equilibrium , the model due to katz , lebowitz and spohn @xcite .",
    "this model has ising - like interactions between pairs of neighbouring spins and evolves by neighbouring spins exchanging places ( kawasaki dynamics ) but with a symmetry - breaking external field that favours hops of up - spins along a particular axis . when the system is open , or has periodic boundaries , a nonequilibrium steady state ensues . in the limit where spins become non - interacting and",
    "there is only one spatial direction , the partially asymmetric exclusion process ( pasep ) described in section [ pasep ] is recovered .",
    "when the spins interact , an ising - like steady state that involves products of @xmath672 matrices ( as described in section [ ising ] ) can be found , albeit only if certain conditions on the hop rates are satisfied .",
    "( these conditions do admit nonequilibrium steady states in which a current flows , however ) . in two dimensions , one has , of course , a finite critical temperature in the absence of a driving force , and there has been particular interest in the nature of the low - temperature ordered phase in the presence of an external drive @xcite .",
    "we discussed in section  [ discretetime ] different updating schemes for which matrix product steady states have been determined . here",
    "we mention some other updating schemes which have not been solved so far .",
    "first an ordered discrete time sequential updating scheme could have the order as a randomly chosen sequence .",
    "the forward and backward schemes of section  refdiscretetime correspond to special sequences .",
    "it would be of interest to construct the a matrix product steady state for an arbitrary fixed sequence .",
    "recently a _ shuffled _ updating scheme has been considered @xcite , in which a new random sequence is chosen at each timestep .",
    "it has been argued that this scheme is relevant to the modelling of pedestrian dynamics .",
    "the shuffled updating scheme guarantees that each site or bond is updated exactly once in each timestep but is more stochastic than an ordered sequential scheme . again",
    "it would be of interest to see if a matrix product could be used to describe the steady state .",
    "we thank all the many colleagues with whom it has been a pleasure to discuss nonequilibrium matrix product states over the years . in particular",
    "we acknowledge our collaborators and other authors whose work we have summarised . for their useful discussions and insightful comments during the preparation of this manuscript",

    "the continuity equation ( [ cty2 ] ) is a particularly simple case of a first order quasi - linear differential equation for the density @xmath691 the term on the right hand side would represent a source or sink of particles and is relevant for example to the case where creation and annihilation processes exist .",
    "such an equation can generally be solved by the method of characteristics @xcite which involves identifying the characteristic curves along which information from the boundary or initial condition propagates through the space - time domain .",
    "the characteristic curves satisfy @xmath692 of which the two independent conditions may be written @xmath693 these equations generally have two families of solution @xmath694 then the solution to ( [ cty3 ] ) is of the form @xmath695 where the function @xmath696 is fixed by the initial data .    for the case ( [ cty2 ] ) , i.e. @xmath697 , the characteristics in the @xmath74@xmath6 plane are straight lines with slope @xmath59 and @xmath49 is constant along these lines , as can be seen from ( [ xrho ] ) .",
    "more generally the characteristics are curves in the @xmath74@xmath6 plane and the density varies along the characteristic .",
    "this can be seen by integrating ( [ xrho ] ) @xmath698 which gives @xmath49 implicitly as a function of @xmath6 , then the trajectory of the characteristic is given by @xmath699 if we consider a patch of the initial density profile of density @xmath700 at @xmath411 , its density evolves according to ( [ patden ] ) and ( [ patpos ] ) gives the position of the patch .",
