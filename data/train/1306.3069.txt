    "the nuclear level scheme of the thorium-229 isotope is expected to feature a long - lived isomer state , @xmath3th , extremely close to the nuclear ground state .",

    "this standard could reach an uncertainty level of @xmath5  @xcite , and provide a new powerful instrument for testing the stability of fundamental constants  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that an ensemble of thorium nuclei doped into a transparent crystal may demonstrate superradiance with a non - trivial emission dynamics  @xcite , and may be used for building an ultraviolet ( uv ) laser  @xcite .",
    "finally , the frequency shifts and broadenings produced by such a crystal lattice environment might be used in studies of material properties , as is commonly done in mssbauer spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "the necessary step towards all of these exciting applications is a direct observation and precise determination of the isomer state energy .",
    "the existence of the low - energy state in the @xmath6th nucleus was first conjectured by kroger and reich based on studies of the @xmath1-ray spectrum following the @xmath2-decay of uranium-233  @xcite .",
    "they concluded that this nucleus has a @xmath7 isomer level lying within @xmath8ev above the @xmath9 ground state level .",
    "the development of high quality germanium detectors ( resolution from 300 to 900ev ) allowed helmer and reich to measure more precise @xmath1-energies in 1989  1993 and to predict the energy of the nuclear transition to be @xmath10ev , placing it into the range of optical frequencies  @xcite . the decay pattern and combinations of transitions used by helmer and reich",
    "are presented in figure [ fig : f1 ] ( a ) .",
    "this unnaturally low value of @xmath4 triggered a multitude of investigations , both theoretical and experimental , trying to determine the transition energy precisely , and to specify other properties of the @xmath7 excited state ( such as lifetime and magnetic moment ) .",
    "however , searches for direct photon emission from the low - lying excited state performed in the late 90 s @xcite have failed to observe a signal  @xcite . in 2005 ,",
    "guimraes - filho and helene re - analysed the data of helmer and reich , taking into account new information about the nuclear decay pattern  @xcite .",
    "they derived @xmath11ev .    in 2007 , a cryogenic nasa x - ray microcalorimeter with instrumental resolution @xmath12 from 26 to 30ev ( fwhm ) allowed beck et al .",
    "@xcite to perform a new indirect measurement of @xmath4 , involving lower energy nuclear states , as depicted in figure [ fig : f1 ] ( b ) . in this measurement ,",
    "the obtained transition energy ( 7ev ) was corrected by accounting for the theoretical branching ratios @xmath13 estimated as 1/13 , and @xmath14 estimated as 2% in  @xcite .",
    "this correction yields the currently most accepted value @xmath15ev , now placing the transition into the vacuum uv range ( @xmath16 nm ) .    in the experiments decribed above ( @xcite ) the isomer transition energy @xmath4",
    "is not measured directly but is derived from the spectrum of higher - energy ( kev ) @xmath1-radiation of a spontaneously decaying @xmath17u source .",
    "we will refer to these measurements as _",
    "indirect passive_. possible alternatives are _ direct passive _ and _ active _ approaches .    in the _ direct passive _ schemes ( figure  [ fig : f1 ] ( d ) )",
    ", the aim is to perform spectroscopy of the ultraviolet radiation emitted from the isomer appearing in the @xmath2-decay of @xmath17u ( 2% of the nuclei decay is expected to lead into the isomer state ) .",
    "this method has two main difficulties : a relatively high false count rate caused by the uranium sample radioactivity , and a high probability of non - radiative decay ( quenching ) of the isomer state in neutral thorium atoms ( up to @xmath18 times higher than the radiative decay rate @xcite ) . to overcome these problems ,",
    "it was proposed in  @xcite to extract @xmath2-recoil thorium ions ejected from an uranium sample , and collect them in a small spot on a mgf@xmath19 coated surface to minimize the quenching rate .",
    "vacuum ultraviolet spectroscopy of the emitted fluorescence radiation may then allow to measure the isomer transition energy .    on the contrary , in _ active approaches _ , thorium nuclei ( in the ground state )",
    "will be illuminated by tunable radiation to excite them to the isomer state . in the _ solid - state approach _ a macroscopic ( @xmath20 ) number of thorium ions doped into uv transparent crystals",
    "can be excited , for example , by synchrotron radiation , and the emerging fluorescence signal can be studied  @xcite",
    ". apparent advantage of this approach is the huge number of simultaneously excited nuclei . at the same time",
    ", crystal fluorescence can cause difficulties in identifying the thorium isomer transition , and various crystal effects can hamper the precise determination of @xmath4 .",
    "another approach is the _ spectroscopy of trapped thorium ions_. at ptb , germany , work is under way to excite nuclei of th@xmath21 ions into the isomer state using a two - photon scheme , exploiting the electronic bridge mechanism  @xcite . in georgia university of technology ,",
    "usa , the laser manipulation of th@xmath22 ions is under investigation  @xcite .",
    "detection of the excitation of the thorium into the isomer state may be based on a change of the electronic hyperfine structure  @xcite .",
    "studies of the hyperfine structure of thorium are also performed at the igisol facility in jyvskyl , finland , in collaboration with a group of the university of mainz , germany  @xcite .",
    "we should also mention a number of studies aimed to measure the lifetime of the isomer state without a determination of @xmath4 . in  @xcite ,",
    "the half life of the isomer state for a _ bare nucleus _ was derived theoretically based on the calculations of the matrix element of the nuclear magnetic moment and on the experimental data concerning transitions at higher energies .",
    "they predict a half - life of @xmath23 for the isomer transition , where @xmath24 is given in ev , which yields @xmath25min for @xmath26ev .",
    "direct measurements of this lifetime were performed in several groups  @xcite .",
    "the obtained results vary from @xmath27 min  @xcite to 6 hours  @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy may be explained either by an incorrect interpretation of the observations @xcite or by a difference in chemical composition of the thorium resulting in different internal conversion rates .",
    "all active approaches and eventually all nuclear spectroscopy applications require irradiation of the sample with some external narrow - band tunable radiation , and study of the emerging fluorescence .",
    "the estimation of the error @xmath28ev on the isomer energy presented in  @xcite corresponds to one standard deviation , therefore it is necessary to scan the excitation source over 2ev ( @xmath29 ) to find the transition with 95% probability , or over 3ev ( @xmath30 ) to find the transition with 99.7% probability .",
    "sakharov re - estimated the influence of the uncertainty of the 29.39kev peak on the isomer energy derivation in  @xcite and obtained an error of 1.31.5ev  @xcite .",
    "moreover , an analysis of more recent experimental data led him to claim that the energy of the isomer state can be anywhere in the range 015ev , if the isomer state exists at all .",
    "we believe it will be technically difficult , if not impossible , to cover such a broad energy range with a tunable narrow - band source of ultraviolet radiation in a reasonable time . we therefore propose to first increase the energy resolution on @xmath4 by an improved indirect measurement compared to  @xcite .",
    "as we show below , it appears possible to resolve the 29.18kev doublet  @xcite presented in figure  [ fig : f1 ] ( c ) with todays state - of - the - art x - ray spectrometers .",
    "resolving this doublet would significantly increase confidence in the existence of the isomer state .",
    "moreover , the isomer energy would be measured without additional theoretical input parameters like branching ratios etc .",
    "the aim of the present study is to investigate the possibility of resolving the 29.18kev line clearly as a doublet over a broad range of values for the isomer energy splitting and the branching ratio , and to analyze the precision that can be obtained on @xmath4 depending on the relevant experimental parameters .",
    "the operation principle of high - resolution x - ray microcalorimeters is to detect the heat deposited by an x- or @xmath1-ray interacting with an absorber , using a very sensitive thermometer .",
    "interaction with the absorber material mainly proceeds through the photoeffect .",
    "the energy of the produced photoelectron as well as auger electrons together with their thermalization cascade should be effectively deposited within the volume of the absorber  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the absorber should have a small heat capacity @xmath31 for good instrumental energy resolution @xmath12 .",
    "various microcalorimeters differ in geometry , absorber material , sensor , etc . , which leads to different energy resolutions , stopping powers , total detector surfaces etc .",
    "many of these parameters are connected and can not be optimized independently .",
    "for example , increasing the size of absorber increases the solid angle and/or stopping power but degrades the instrumental energy resolution . finally , we note that after a detection event , dissipation of the deposited heat leads to a detector - specific dead time , during which the energy of a successive photon can not be measured correctly .",
    "therefore it is impossible to improve the precision of the measurements infinitely simply by using a more active sample , or by placing the sample very close to the detector .",
    "the total count rate can be reduced using a designed filter which will primarily absorb photons outside the 29.18kev region of interest .",
    "the present study aims to answer two questions : how does the possibility to resolve the 29.18kev peak as a doublet depend on the experimental parameters , and how to attain the most precise determination of the isomer transition energy @xmath4 .",
    "as outlined above , parameters of the experimental setup can be controlled to some extent only . for a proper design of suitable detectors and experimental configurations ,",
    "we analyze how the key parameters affect these two points .      the model employed for the statistical study should not contain too many parameters to make it accessible to a multi - factor analysis . on the other hand , it should be sufficiently comprehensive for a realistic feasibility study . for the sake of convenience ,",
    "we assume a fixed total measurement time of @xmath32s , approximately 11 days , which corresponds to the total time of the successfull measurement in  @xcite .",
    "also we suppose that the background count rate near the 29.18kev doublet is flat and symmetric , and that the monoenergetic line has gaussian shape with full width at half maximum equal to @xmath12 ( see section  [ sec : issues ] for a discussion of these approximations ) .    the considered total energy interval ( 0 - 70ev ) is subdivided to a set of 0.4ev bins ( approximately a factor 10 below the expected instrumental energy resolution ) .",
    "the number of counts in the @xmath33th energy bin is a poissonian random number @xmath34 with a mean value @xmath35 equal to @xmath36+d\\cdot r_{\\mathrm{bg}}\\cdot t , \\label{ee:1 } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the signal count rate , @xmath38 is a specific rate of background counts per 1ev energy interval , @xmath39 , @xmath40 are the centers of lines of the components of the 29.18kev doublet , @xmath41 , @xmath42ev is one energy bin , @xmath43 is the mean energy of the @xmath33th bin , and @xmath44 is the branching ratio .",

    ", we use the maximum likelihood method .",
    "the likelihood function @xmath52 is the probability for realizing the set @xmath46 , if true mean values @xmath35 are equal to @xmath53 .",
    "we also introduce the logarithmic likelihood function @xmath54 .",
    "\\label{ee:3}\\ ] ]      as it was outlined above , resolving the 29.18kev line as a doublet would significantly reduce the doubts  @xcite in the existence of the isomer state in the @xmath6th nucleus .",
    "our first aim is to discuss the feasability of such an identification depending on experimental parametes and the ( yet unknown ) values of the isomer energy splitting @xmath55 and the branching ratio @xmath44 .",
    "+   +     +   +    to check whether a given set of experimental data corresponds to a single line or to a doublet , one can apply the likelihood ratio test  @xcite .",
    "the essence of this test and the method to estimate the significance level is described in appendix  a. here we define the significance level as the probability to identify incorrectly the single peak as a doublet or the doublet as a single peak using the likelihood ratio test in the situation when we have either a single peak or a doublet whose parameters are specified .",
    "figures  [ ff:2 ] ,  [ ff:3 ] show level curves for the signal count rates @xmath37 which are necessary to attain a significance level of 1% for various values of the instrumental resolution @xmath12 and the @xmath56 ratio , in the @xmath57 plane .",
    "it is interesting to note that the optimal energy resolution is attained when @xmath58 and not for equally strong components of the doublet .",
    "this is explained by the fact that such a branching ratio leads to a noticeable asymmetry of the peak which facilitates the identification of a second component , increasing @xmath44 leads to a reduction of the main peak at fixed total signal count rate @xmath37 .",
    "the aim of the proposed spectroscopy study is not only to resolve the 29.18kev line in the @xmath1-spectrum of @xmath17u as a doublet but to determine the energy splitting with maximum precision .",
    "we study the standard deviation @xmath59 of the isomer energy as a characteristic measure of precision ( in the following we call @xmath60 the _ uncertainty of @xmath4 _ ) . here and below ,",
    "angular brackets denote expectation values , @xmath4 and @xmath61 denote `` true '' and measured values of the isomer transition energy respectively . for the sake of brevity , we suppose that the true values of the energy splitting @xmath4 and of the branching ratio @xmath44 are equal to 7.8ev  @xcite and 1/14  @xcite respectively has 8% error , therefore the value @xmath62 can be considered as a consistent but slightly pessimistic ( from the point of view of spectral resolution ) estimation . ] . as before",

    "@xmath44 , or @xmath63 is straightforward .    to investigate the dependence of @xmath60 on the instrumental energy resolution @xmath12 , the signal count rate @xmath37 , and the specific background count rate @xmath38",
    ", we perform a monte - carlo study of @xmath60 .",
    "for any set of parameters , we simulate the sample @xmath46 as shown in figure  [ fig : f1b ] , and estimate the parameters @xmath64 maximizing the sum ( [ ee:3 ] ) .",
    "we repeat this procedure @xmath65 times and calculate @xmath60 according to ( [ ee:4 ] ) .",

    "finally , in figure  [ fig : f5 ] we present the curves of constant @xmath60 in the plane @xmath67 for fixed ratios @xmath56 .",
    "one can see that improving the instrumental resolution by 1ev increases the precision on the determination of @xmath60 by the same amount as doubling the 29.18kev signal count rate , or doubling the measurement time @xmath63 .",
    "in this section we estimate the attainable count rates and the resulting precision in a measurement of the isomer energy @xmath4 that can be achieved with a state - of - the - art high - resolution microcalorimeter .",
    "in particular we consider the metallic magnetic microcalorimeter maxs-20 as described in ref .",
    "the aim is to demonstrate , that valuable results can be obtained with currently available technology . in section  [ sec : developments ] we describe ongoing work towards a more refined , dedicated detector setup .",
    "the maxs-20 microcalorimeter consists of 8 detector elements ( pixels ) each of which has an absorber plate for incoming radiation ( @xmath68@xmath69m@xmath70 au plate ) connected to a @xmath71@xmath69m@xmath70 paramagnetic temperature sensor ( er - doped au ) through 24 gold stems ( 10@xmath69 m diameter and 5@xmath69 m height each ) .",
    "each sensor is connected to a thermal bath , the system is installed in a cryostat operating at a temperature of about 30mk .",
    "energy deposited into the absorber plate heats the paramagnetic sensor and causes a change of its magnetization in an external magnetic field . measuring this change in magnetization using squids , it is possible to determine the amount of absorbed energy and hence the energy of the incoming x- or @xmath1-rays .",
    "note that after the detection of an x- or @xmath1-ray , the individual pixel can only detect again after a certain relaxation time of the order of 100  ms",
    ". therefore the total count rate @xmath72 should not be too high .    as a sample ,",
    "we consider 1mci of @xmath17u electrodeposited as a film onto a metal planchet with a radius of @xmath73 mm .",
    "we assume the sample to be situated 40 mm from the detector ( outside the cryostat ) with a total surface @xmath74mm@xmath75 .",
    "also we suppose the presence of additional material related to the cryostat vacuum system ( sealing , input window of the cryostat , some other intentionally positioned shielding etc . ) , which we refer to as _",
    "filters_.    according to the nudat 2.6 database  @xcite , each single decay of @xmath17u is accompanied ( on average ) by one @xmath2 particle with an energy from 4.309 to 4.824mev , 0.213 conversion electrons with energies from 2.3 to 600kev ( 97.7% of the electrons have energies below 50kev ) , and 0.0544 photons most of which ( 0.052 per decay ) are @xmath76-shell x - rays with a mean energy of 13kev .",
    "as no individual @xmath76 x - rays are listed in nudat 2.6 ( only average energy and total intensity ) , we have taken the lacking data from the x - ray data booklet  @xcite .    to estimate the detector count rates ,",
    "we suppose that all @xmath2 particles and electrons emitted from the uranium sample are stopped by the sample itself or by the filter materials , therefore , we consider only x- and @xmath1-rays . also it is supposed that all secondary electrons and photons generated in the filters are absorbed in the material locally .",
    "this assumption is correct for relatively thick filters made from light materials like aluminium .",
    "we take into account absorption of the photons within the sample itself , the filters , and the detector .",
    "the total count rate @xmath77 is : @xmath78 here the sum is taken over all photon energies @xmath79 , @xmath80 is the activity of the uranium sample , @xmath81 is the relative intensity ( quantum output ) of photons with the energy @xmath43 per single decay event , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the thicknessess of the gold absorber and filters respectively",
    ". linear absorption coefficients @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) were taken from the xcom photon cross sections database  @xcite .",
    "the count rate @xmath37 of signal photons is : @xmath86 , \\label{ee:6 } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 corresponds to the two components of the doublet , @xmath88 is the au @xmath76 shell fluorescence yield @xcite , @xmath89 is the probability that an energy of a fluorescence photon emitted by a au atom is equal to @xmath90 , and @xmath91 is a probability that an incoming @xmath1-quant with energy @xmath43 will be absorbed , and an @xmath92-ray photon following this absorption leaves the absorber ( escape line ) .",

    "also we suppose that the @xmath92-ray photon is emitted from the @xmath76 shell , i.e. the deepest shell that is accessible by energy conservation , and the probability @xmath89 for emission of the photon is the relative intensity tabulated in  @xcite normalized to the sum of relative intensities from the @xmath76 shell .    evaluating the expressions",
    "( [ ee:5 ] )  ( [ ee:7 ] ) yields a total detector count rate @xmath97hz and a signal count rate of @xmath98mhz for a 1.3 mm thick aluminium filter . without any filter ,",
    "the count rates for the same parameters are : @xmath99hz , and @xmath100mhz .",
    "we see that the aluminium filter absorbs approximately 92% of all photons emitted from the sample , but only about 34% of the signal photons .",
    "we conclude that filtering is an effective method to decrease the total count rate @xmath72 , caused mainly by low - energy thorium @xmath76 shell x - ray .",
    "the background count rate @xmath38 is caused by the escape of some fraction of the dissipated energy of @xmath1-quants absorbed in the detector . in  @xcite",
    ", the number of background counts close to the 29.18kev doublet was about 30  40 events per 3ev bin whereas the total number of counts in the 29.18kev peak was about @xmath101 events .",
    "this yields the ratio @xmath102ev .",
    "assuming that a similar ratio can be realized with the maxs-20 detector , we find that the uncertainty @xmath60 on the measured isomer transition energy @xmath4 will be equal to 0.06ev for an instrumental resolution of @xmath103ev , signal count rate @xmath98mhz and total measurement time @xmath32 s. therefore the proposed experiment to determine the isomer energy @xmath4 is expected to be almost one order of magnitude more precise than the results obtained in the previous experiment  @xcite . reducing the experimental resolution to 6ev and 9ev yields @xmath104ev and @xmath105ev respectively .",
    "increasing the total measurement time to @xmath106s , 1 month , we can measure the isomer transition energy with an uncertainty @xmath107ev for @xmath103ev , @xmath108ev for @xmath109ev , or @xmath110ev for @xmath111ev .",
    "we are aware of certain simplifications and assumptions in the above analysis . here",
    "we briefly resume some additional issues that could arrise , a detailed discussion of these points is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "first , the shape of signal peaks can deviate from gaussian .",
    "for example , a long low energy tail on the spectral lines may lead to the appearance of a noticeable step in the backgound count rate ( see , for example , figure  2 ( a ) in  @xcite ) .",
    "we believe that in the work of ref .",
    "@xcite this effect is caused mainly by the escape of energy from the absorber material , for example in the form of athermal phonons  @xcite .",
    "the yield of compton scattering is not sufficient to explain this step , see appendix  b. to take this effect into account correctly , we will have to modify our model of the background .",
    "a more difficult situation arises when the escaping energy is relatively small , which would lead to an asymmetry of the line rather than the appearance of a tail . in this case",
    ", it would be useful to study an isolated single peak separated from the doublet of interest but intense enough to give good statistics , and/or to perform an independent study with another @xmath1 source , e.g. @xmath112am .",
    "another issue that may appear is a slow time - dependent fluctuation of the response function caused by an uncontrollable drift of ambient magnetic fields and/or cryostat temperature over the duration of the measurement .",
    "we believe we can suppress such drifts below 10ev by temperature stabilization and mu - metal shielding of the setup .",
    "additionally , we will monitor the position of a series of reference x- and @xmath1-ray lines for a correct tracing of this drift , realizing a time - dependent calibration of the detector .",
    "note that x - ray lines generally have a much broader linewidth than @xmath1 lines  @xcite which simplifies the identification .",
    "an auxiliary calibration source , for example @xmath112am , can help to enhance the quality of this callibration .",
    "also we should mention possible interference of the 29.18kev doublet with coincidence and escape lines of x- and @xmath1-rays of @xmath113u and other elements present in the sample .",
    "we plan to study the composition of the sample using `` ordinary '' low - precision @xmath1-spectrometry .",
    "we are currently developing a dedicated new detector for the measurement described above , to some extend interpolating between the maxs-20 ( 0 - 20kev ) and the maxs-200 ( 0 - 200kev ) series  @xcite .",
    "it will feature a linear array of magnetic calorimeters , each with an active area of @xmath114@xmath69m@xmath75 .",
    "we will increase the absorber thickness by a factor of 2 to 3 in comparison with 5@xmath69 m in the maxs-20 , leading to a stopping power of about 50% at 30kev .",
    "we will operate the detectors in a dry 3he/4he - dilution refrigerator at about 20  mk .",
    "in this situation , the intrinsic energy resolution of the detector caused by thermal noises of all kinds is expected to be below 2ev ( fwhm ) . according to the calorimetric detection principle of metallic magnetic calorimeters  @xcite ,",
    "this resolution is independent of energy as long as the total gain ( including operational temperature and external magnetic fields ) is stable , the dependence of the detector response on the event position in the absorber is negligible , and the photon energy @xmath24 is still small enough to be within the range of linear detector response @xmath115 . also we expect that the minimal time between two correctly measurable counts in a single detector element ( pixel ) will be about 100 ms .",
    "so far , we have achieved resolving powers up to about @xmath116 ( corresponding to 1.6ev ( fwhm ) at 5.9kev ) with our maxs-20 devices ( unpublished ) , being limited by a combination of both , instabilities of the operating temperature and a position dependence .",
    "we believe that we can improve the short - term stability of the total gain and keep the position dependence of absorbtion events small enough to allow resolving powers beyond @xmath65 in the planned experiment . also , the response of the present maxs-20 detector to photon energies below 60kev has a small quadratic deviation from a linear behavior , see figure  [ fig:7 ] . at an energy of 30kev",
    "this deviation is only about 3% , which yields a 6% degradation of the intrinsic energy resolution compared to the low - energy signals , i.e. below 2.12ev on an absolute scale .",
    "the sample should ideally consist of isotopically pure @xmath17u to avoid a too high count rate not carrying relevant information and possible interference with the 29.18kev thorium doublet signal .",
    "for this project , we have 560 mg ( about 5mci activity ) raw sample material available ( in oxide powder form ) .",
    "the origin and preparation procedure of this material is unknown , from the @xmath1-spectrum we suspect that originally , @xmath117th has been activated in a high - flux neutron reactor and the @xmath17u has been separated chemically .",
    "a mass spectrum of the raw material , produced by an in - house icp - ms can be seen in figure  [ fig:8 ] .",
    "the raw material contains @xmath118% @xmath17u , together with traces of @xmath117u , @xmath119u , @xmath120u , @xmath121u , and the decay product @xmath6th .",
    "further daughter product of the @xmath17u chain have not been detected .    to further purify the sample , we will perform a purex uranium extraction procedure .",
    "we have also observed an efficient additional element separation in the electrodeposition process . in - house analysis using @xmath1- and @xmath2-spectroscopy , icp - ms , and neutron activation analysis will allow us to quantify the success of this procedures and finally know the exact composition of the final measurement sample .",
    "the sample will be produced by electroplating @xmath17u from a liquid solution onto a stainless steel or aluminium planchets .",
    "the target activity of 1mci corresponds to 104 mg of pure @xmath17u or 118 mg of uo@xmath19 .",
    "producing correspondingly thick films ( 15 - 20@xmath69 m ) turned out to be difficult in electroplating @xcite .",
    "we have therefore developed a process to deposit up to 20 mg uranium onto stainless steel or aluminium foils of only 10 - 50@xmath69 m thickness .",
    "these samples can easily be stacked to realize the target activity without the carrier foils significantly reducing the count rate in the 29.18kev peak .",
    "we have analyzed the feasability of an indirect measurement of the low - energy isomer state in @xmath6th using a high - resolution magnetic microcalorimeter .",
    "we propose to resolve the 29.18kev doublet in the @xmath1-radiation spectrum following the @xmath2-decay of @xmath17u .",

    "the question we want to answer is whether the short hypothesis is correct ? or , more precisely : how plausible ( or unplausible ) is it to obtain the set of observables @xmath123 , if the short model is correct ?",
    "the likelihood ratio test is a powerful method to answer this question . to illustrate the essence of this test ,",
    "let us represent @xmath47 observations @xmath123 as a point @xmath130 in the @xmath47-dimensional euclidean sample space .",
    "@xmath47 functions @xmath131 form an @xmath132-dimensional surface @xmath133 corresponding the long hypothesis . in turn , these functions with additional conditions corresponding the short hypothesis form the @xmath134-dimensional surface @xmath135 within @xmath133 , see figure  [ fig : a1 ] .",

    "the uranium activity of one 19 mm diameter planchet was about 0.02mci which corresponds to @xmath191@xmath69 m .",

    "the peak corresponding to the absorption of 29.18kev photons has gaussian shape with about @xmath195 events per 3ev bin height in the maximum , and 26ev fwhm , see figure  2(a ) in  @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a total number of counts forming this peak of about @xmath196 .",
    "therefore , compton scattering of 29.18kev photons in the source or filter material produces only 0.053 events per 1ev interval , or 0.16 events per 3ev bin .",
    "this value is significantly lower than the observed step of 10 counts per 3ev bin .",
    "a similar estimation for a @xmath197 m layer of uranium and @xmath198 mm of aluminium filter ( parameters of the planned experiment ) leads to @xmath199ev@xmath194 .",
    "note that in ( [ eq : a4 ] ) we treat all electrons as free .",
