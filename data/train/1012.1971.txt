    "<S> after that the flavon fields take vev , @xmath10 is spontaneously broken as below @xmath16 so @xmath10 is spontaneously broken into @xmath17 in the charged fermion sector while into @xmath18 in the neutrino sector where @xmath18 and @xmath17 are two subgroups of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the misalignment between the two sectors is at the origin of large lepton mixing . in general this </S>",
