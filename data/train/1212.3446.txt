    "the difference between the measured toa and the arrival time predicted by a best - fit model is known as the timing residual .",

    ", it is an excellent target for high - precision pulsar timing studies .",
    "it is also fortuitously located away from the galactic plane ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) , which permits long observing sessions during periods of local sidereal time when competition for the telescope is relatively low .",
    "early timing of this pulsar highlighted the need for more accurate polarimetric calibration @xcite .",
    "the systematic timing error due to instrumental polarization artifacts is readily observed in the dramatic variation of arrival time residuals as a function of parallactic angle ( see figure  [ fig : uncalibrated ] ) .",
    "this issue motivated the discovery and development of the polarimetric invariant profile @xcite .",
    "arrival times derived from the invariant profile proved to be significantly more accurate than those of the total intensity profile , a breakthrough that led to the first detection of annual - orbital parallax and a new test of general relativity @xcite .    despite its demonstrated advantages over the total intensity profile ,",
    "there remain a number of drawbacks to the use of the invariant profile .",
    "first , the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath6 of the invariant profile is lower than that of the total intensity , reaching zero for completely polarized sources .",
    "second , the noise in the invariant profile is neither normally distributed nor homoscedastic with respect to pulse longitude ( see appendix  [ app : invariant ] ) ; these two properties are assumed , either explicitly or implicitly , by most template matching algorithms commonly used for pulsar timing . finally , the computation of the invariant profile requires estimation and correction of the bias due to noise , and the relative precision of the bias estimate is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of discrete samples within off - pulse regions of pulse longitude . for a typical observation of psrj0437@xmath04715 ,",
    "the relative error in the bias correction is of the order of 8% , an unacceptably large uncertainty when aiming for arrival time uncertainty that is four orders of magnitude smaller than the pulse width .",
    "these concerns motivated the development of matrix template matching ( mtm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a technique that exploits the additional timing information in the polarized component of the pulsar signal while simultaneously eliminating residual polarimetric calibration errors .",
    "for some pulsars , the mean polarization profile exhibits sharper features than observed in the total intensity ; these features generate more power at higher harmonics of the pulsar spin frequency , yielding greater arrival time precision than might be expected from the polarized flux alone ( e.g. see figure 1 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "furthermore , mtm improves arrival time accuracy by mitigating systematic timing errors due to instrumental polarization artifacts .",
    "although the development of mtm was primarily driven by the high - precision timing of psrj0437@xmath04715 , @xcite predicted that psrj1022@xmath11001  would benefit most from this technique , including a @xmath7 increase in timing precision and a significant decrease in systematic timing error .",
    "psrj1022@xmath11001  was contemporaneously discovered in both the princeton - arecibo declination - strip survey @xcite and the green bank northern sky survey @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed variations in the shape of its mean pulse profile on a timescale of the order of minutes and noted that the accuracy of arrival time estimates was limited by this effect .",
    "mean profile variations over such timescales would be distinct from pulse - to - pulse shape variations such as giant pulses , microstructure , and drifting sub - pulses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "a first - order approximation of the coefficient of correlated systematic timing error is given by @xmath62 this correlation coefficient depends only on the shape of the mean polarization profile and has no modal structure on the celestial sphere .",

    "the cross - spectral power measurements of @xcite are compared with the predicted values of @xmath63 in figure  [ fig : ych+11 ] ; the coefficient of correlation between predicted and measured values is @xmath64 .",
    "the agreement between predicted and experimental measures of correlation indicates that the systematic error due to instrumental distortion is a plausible contributor to the apparent anti - correlation between the results of @xcite and the expected quadrupolar signature predicted by @xcite .",
    "also shown in table  [ tab : theory ] are the relative arrival time uncertainties @xmath41 and @xmath42 defined in @xcite .",
    "the former is the ratio between the theoretical error in arrival time estimates derived using matrix template matching ( mtm ) and the error in estimates derived using only the total intensity ; the latter is the ratio between the uncertainties in arrival times derived from the invariant interval and from the total intensity .",
    "the statistical uncertainty in the invariant profile arrival times is underestimated because the effects of heteroscedasticity and bias correction error are not considered .",
    "regardless , for every pulsar in the ppta , precision is lost through use of the invariant interval .",
    "the increase in uncertainty is most dramatic for psr  j1744@xmath01134 , which emits almost 100% linearly polarized radiation .",
    "for this pulsar , mtm is also predicted to yield arrival times with greater error than those derived from the total intensity owing to the large coefficient of multiple correlation ( @xmath65 ) between the phase shift used to compute the toa and the model parameters that describe the polarization transformation .",
    "table  [ tab : theory ] also predicts that matrix template matching will yield the greatest relative improvement in arrival time precision for psrj1022@xmath11001 .",
    "this pulsar also has the second - highest value for predicted systematic timing error owing to the susceptibility of the total intensity profile to polarization distortion .",
    "this may explain the profile shape variations and excess arrival time error first noted by @xcite . in a detailed study of the spectrum and polarization of these variations using the effelsberg 100-m radio telescope , @xcite assert that the observed fluctuations in pulse shape can not be explained by instrumental effects .",
    "however , the data used in this analysis were calibrated using the `` ideal feed '' assumption that there is no cross - coupling between receptors and that the reference source used for gain calibration produces an equal and in - phase response in each receptor .",
    "given that receptor cross - coupling of the order of 10% to 20% is commonly observed when more accurate calibration is performed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , an instrumental origin of the variability deserves consideration .    for instance , the temporal variation of the total intensity profile observed by @xcite is reproducible using a simple model in which the polarized signal is rotated by the parallactic angle of the receiver and then subjected to an instrumental boost that mixes @xmath3710% of the linearly - polarized flux with the total intensity .",
    "the similarity between the simulated observations plotted in figure  [ fig : kxc+99 ] and the total intensity profiles presented in figure 2 of @xcite supports the argument that the variations are the result of uncalibrated instrumental distortion .",
    "similarly , the small frequency - scale variations observed by @xcite may be readily explained by spectral variation of the instrumental response ( e.g.  figure 3 of * ? ? ?",
    "the observations used to demonstrate the narrow - band variations and presented in figure 8 of @xcite were recorded using the effelsberg - berkeley - pulsar - processor with a bandwidth of 56  mhz . in this mode , only the fluxes in each of the circularly polarized signals ( i.e.  two out of four stokes parameters ) are retained ; consequently , only the mixing between circularly - polarized flux and total intensity can be calibrated in these data . therefore , frequency - dependent mixing between linearly - polarized flux and total intensity is a plausible explanation for the observed profile shape variations .",
    "@xcite analyzed the variability of psrj1022@xmath11001  using multi - frequency observations made at the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) .",
    "they argue that , because the wsrt is composed of equatorially - mounted antennas , it is possible to rule out pulse shape variations due to instrumental distortion combined with parallactic rotation of the feed . however , the polarimetric response of a phased array can vary in both time and frequency for a wide variety of reasons , including imperfect phase calibration and ( as for any single - dish antenna ) instrumental gain variations . indeed , the automatic gain controllers used to prevent instrumental saturation @xcite",
    "also make it impossible to accurately calibrate the polarimetric response of the wsrt phased array @xcite",
    ".    the high degree of susceptibility of the psrj1022@xmath11001  pulse profile to polarization distortion and the inadequate instrumental calibration employed in these previous works cast doubt on the conclusion that the profile variations are intrinsic to the pulsar .",
    "furthermore , @xcite find no evidence of significant profile shape variations in psrj1022@xmath11001  observations made at the parkes observatory .",
    "this study achieved arrival time residuals with a standard deviation of the order of 2.3  @xmath3s and @xmath66 per degree of freedom @xmath67 , whereas @xcite obtained a reduced @xmath66 close to unity only after systematic errors of the order of 10  @xmath3s were added in quadrature to the formal uncertainties .",
    "the analysis by @xcite is based on observations integrated over 5  min and 64  mhz and spanning 1.3 years .",
    "increasing the integration length to 60  min and the time span to 2.3 years yielded arrival time residuals with a standard deviation of the order of 1.5  @xmath3s and reduced @xmath68 @xcite . with the same instrumentation and similar integration lengths , @xcite achieved 1.6  @xmath3s residuals in data spanning 5.1 years . in the absence of systematic error and other sources of noise ( e.g. dispersion variations ) ,",
    "the one - hour integrations used in these two studies should have yielded timing residuals of the order of 660  ns .",
    "this is of the same order as the systematic timing error introduced by a differential gain error of @xmath69 or by receptor non - orthogonality of @xmath70 ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab : theory ] ) .",
    "however , the arrival times used in these studies were derived from either uncalibrated @xcite or inaccurately calibrated @xcite total intensity pulse profiles , which are highly susceptible to instrumental distortion .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to anticipate that high - fidelity polarimetric calibration will improve the accuracy of psrj1022@xmath11001  arrival time estimates .",

    "the corrected data were then summed until the integration length was of the order of five minutes .      to use a pulsar as a polarized reference source requires a high @xmath6 , well - calibrated , template polarization profile . from over 700 hours of psrj0437@xmath04715  observations",

    "the observed stokes parameters were normalized to account for pulsar flux variations as described in appendix  [ app : invariant ] .",
    "as in @xcite , the two degenerate model parameters ( a boost along the stokes @xmath80 axis and a rotation about this axis ) were constrained by assuming that observations of 3c 218 ( hydra  a ) have negligible circular polarization and that the orientation of the receiver is known .",
    "although these assumptions are not necessarily valid , absolute certainty in the stokes parameters is not required for the purposes of a high - precision timing experiment .",
    "it is sufficient that the observed stokes parameters can be mapped to the template profile by a single jones transformation .",
    "this prerequisite may be evaluated using the objective merit function of the mtm least - squares fit ; the reduced @xmath66 statistic will be greater than unity whenever the transformation between the template and the observed pulse profile is not well - described by a single jones matrix .",
    "various phenomena may contribute to a poor model fit .",
    "for example , if the mean polarized emission from the pulsar evolves over time , then the difference between the template and the observed profile will vary as a function of pulse longitude in a manner that can not be adequately modeled by a single jones transformation .",
    "furthermore , as jones matrices describe only linear transformations of the electric field , matrix template matching will fail to model any non - linear component of the instrument .",
    "analog - to - digital conversion using only two bits per sample is an intrinsically non - linear process ; therefore , variations in the response of the digitizer adversely affect the mtm goodness - of - fit , as shown in figure  [ fig : chisq_d2bit ] .    here , 5 of the @xmath81",
    "mem - calibrated psrj0437@xmath04715  observations were integrated to produce a template profile and the mean polarization profiles from each of the original @xmath81 observations were fit to this template using mtm .",
    "the reduced @xmath66 of each mtm fit ( averaged over all frequency channels ) is highly correlated with the median value of the two - bit distortion @xmath77 in each session ; i.e.  greater distortion reduces the merit of the mtm fits . for the 5 observations used to create the template profile , @xmath82 because covariance between the observation and the template is not included in the definition of the mtm objective merit function .",
    "figure  [ fig : chisq_d2bit ] justifies the experimental design decision to regularly update the two - bit sampling thresholds during each observation .",
    "independent sampling thresholds were applied to each of the two orthogonal polarizations ; consequently , the astronomical signal was subjected to an unknown differential gain that varies with time .",
    "such differential gain variations can be modeled using mtm , whereas the non - linear response of the digitizer can not .",

    "* ) , which employs an 8-bit digitizer .",
    "these facts might point to the existence of a non - linear component in the signal path shared by cpsr2 and pdfb2 .",
    "however , the third and fourth generations of the pdfb also regularly exhibit @xmath84% over - polarization when it is not observed using the latest generation of baseband recording instrumentation at parkes .",

    "matrix template matching has been previously utilized to calibrate and derive arrival time estimates from observations of psrj0437@xmath04715  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , this method can not be applied directly to psrj1022@xmath11001  because the mean flux of this pulsar at 20  cm ( @xmath376  mjy ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is much lower and the precision of calibrator solutions derived from similar integration lengths is inadequate .",
    "it is not possible to integrate over longer intervals because the instrumental response varies with time , primarily due to the parallactic rotation of the receiver .",
    "therefore , to calibrate the psrj1022@xmath11001  data , a new technique was developed that combines mtm with mem .",
    "the new method , called measured equation template matching ( metm ) , matches multiple pulsar observations to the template profile , thereby increasing the precision of the solution . as with mem , variations of the instrumental response ( e.g. the parallactic rotation of the receiver )",
    "are included in the model .",
    "metm also incorporates measurements of an artificial reference source ( e.g. a noise diode coupled to the receptors ) , enabling the backend component of the calibrator solution to be later updated as in @xcite so that the solution may be applied to other astronomical sources .",
    "in contrast with mem , the metm method does not require any additional observations of a source of known circular polarization to constrain the boost along the stokes @xmath80 axis because the template profile provides this information .",
    "using the new metm technique , a detailed history of the instrumental response at parkes was derived from the psrj0437@xmath04715  data and used to calibrate the psrj1022@xmath11001  data .",
    "first , the high @xmath6 template profile ( created as described in the previous section ) and the new metm method were used to derive a calibrator solution from every observation of psrj0437@xmath04715  with more than 3.5 hours of integration .",
    "a total of @xmath85 solutions were produced , spanning 2003 april to 2010 june .",
    "the instrumental response was modeled using equation ( 19 ) of @xcite , which includes three independent lorentz boost transformations described by the differential gain and the non - orthogonality parameters , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the derived non - orthogonality parameter estimates are plotted in figure  [ fig : coupling ] .",
    "in addition to smooth variations in @xmath47 and @xmath46 , there are a number of distinct steps that correspond to physical changes in the 21-cm multibeam receiver and downconversion system at parkes .",
    "the gaps in the data correspond to maintenance periods during which the multibeam receiver was unavailable ( 2003 november 9 to 2004",
    "september 7 , and 2006 december 16 to 2007 may 17 ) . immediately following the first maintenance period ,",
    "the receptor cross - coupling remains stable for a period of approximately one year .",
    "the distinct changes in state that occur around mjd 53660 ( 2005 october 17 ) and mjd 53800 ( 2006 march 6 ) are due to changes in the downconversion system ( the signal paths for the two cpsr2 bands were swapped ) . following the second maintenance period ,",
    "the cross - coupling parameters are notably less stable in both time and frequency .",
    "figure  [ fig : boost_close ] provides a closer look at the variations of these parameters over a period of one week and a bandwidth of 20  mhz .",
    "in addition to significant quasi - periodic variations in these parameters as a function of radio frequency , the spectral structure appears to drift as a function of time .",
    "for example , from 11 to 12 february 2010 , the main features in the spectrum have shifted toward lower frequencies by @xmath86  mhz .",
    "after mjd @xmath37 54300 , it is invalid to assume that the receptor cross - coupling remains stable for any period of time longer than a day .",
    "figure  [ fig : coupling ] plots the non - orthogonality parameters in units of centiradians ; these values can be multiplied by the estimates of @xmath40 listed in table  [ tab : theory ] to approximate the variation in systematic arrival time error introduced by receptor cross - coupling .",
    "for example , for psrj1022@xmath11001 , the peak - to - peak variations of @xmath87 radians in both @xmath47 and @xmath46 are predicted to induce systematic timing errors of the order of 1.7@xmath3s .",
    "however , after integrating over all frequency channels , the net effect of the cross - coupling variations will be diminished .",
    "furthermore , receptor cross - coupling describes only two of the three forms of instrumental distortion .",
    "in addition to the presumption of zero receptor cross - coupling , calibration techniques based on the ideal feed assumption typically also incorporate the false premise that the artificial reference source illuminates both receptors identically . under this assumption ,",
    "any intrinsic imbalance in the induced amplitude of the reference source signal in each receptor will be misinterpreted as differential gain .",
    "in contrast , the metm technique includes direct estimation of the stokes parameters of the reference source ( as in fig .  2 of * ? ? ? * ) . using these estimates ,",
    "the systematic error in differential gain @xmath88 due to unbalanced reference source amplitudes may be derived .",
    "given estimates of @xmath88 , @xmath47 and @xmath46 as a function of frequency , it is possible to directly compute the systematic arrival time error at each epoch by applying the instrumental distortion transformation to a copy of the template profile and estimating the induced phase shift between the template and its distorted copy .",
    "application of the metm - derived instrumental distortion parameters to the psrj1022@xmath11001  template profile yields the systematic timing error shown in figure  [ fig : systematic_error ] .",
    "the instrumental distortion transformation is applied independently in each frequency channel before integrating over frequency .",
    "the induced phase shift is computed using only the total intensity profile and the fourier - domain template matching algorithm described by @xcite . during the periods of maintenance on the parkes 21-cm multibeam receiver , the solutions derived from observations made with the receiver",
    "have been used .",
    "uncalibrated instrumental distortion introduces peak - to - peak variations in systematic timing error of the order of 600ns ; the largest jumps in timing error occur when switching between receivers .",
    "these systematic errors are present in arrival times derived from either uncalibrated or inaccurately - calibrated psrj1022@xmath11001  observations .",
    "as shown in the following section , these errors are significantly reduced after calibration with the metm - derived solutions .      the solutions produced using the new metm method",
    "were applied to calibrate the 5-minute psrj1022@xmath11001  integrations as in @xcite .",
    "the calibrated data were then integrated in frequency and time to form approximately 64-minute integrations .",
    "the observations with the greatest @xmath6 were added to form a full - polarization template profile with an integration length of @xmath89 hours , shown in figure  [ fig:1022 ] .    to enable a quantitative comparison between the analysis described in this paper and previous work , the psrj1022@xmath11001  observations were also calibrated using the ideal feed assumption employed by @xcite .",
    "arrival times for the two datasets were then derived using only the total intensity profile @xcite and matrix template matching @xcite .",
    "these variations produced four sets of arrival time estimates , calibrated using either full measurement equation template matching ( metm ) or the ideal feed assumption ( ifa ) and timed using either matrix template matching ( mtm ) or standard total intensity ( sti ) methods .",

    "that is , compared to uncalibrated data , the ifa - calibrated data are equally adversely affected by distortions to the total intensity profile .",
    "this is not surprising , given that the ifa does not apply to the 21-cm multibeam receiver at parkes @xcite .",
    "calibration via measurement equation template matching ( metm ) reduces both the standard deviation of the arrival time residuals and the reduced @xmath66 of the model fit . assuming that the systematic error removed by metm is uncorrelated with the remaining noise in the metm ",
    "sti residuals , instrumental distortion of the ifa - calibrated total intensity profile gives rise to timing errors with a standard deviation of approximately 1.3  @xmath3s .",
    "for both metm- and ifa - calibrated data sets , matrix template matching ( mtm ) yields arrival times of similar quality .",
    "this indicates that mtm is able to correct the remaining instrumental calibration errors in the ifa data and produce arrival time estimates with reduced systematic error .",
    "it is not possible to test mtm on uncalibrated data because the variation of instrumental response with frequency leads to bandwidth depolarization , which can not be modeled using a single jones matrix . that is ,",
    "although inaccurate , calibration based on the ifa may be sufficient to avoid depolarization .",
    "focusing on only the metm - calibrated data , comparison of arrival times generated using sti and mtm demonstrates that mtm reduces the standard deviation of arrival time residuals by approximately 35% , which is consistent with the relative uncertainty predicted in table  [ tab : theory ] and by @xcite .",

    "for the typical observation of psrj0437@xmath04715 , this summation reduces the relative error of the normalization factor by @xmath167 , thereby yielding more normally distributed normalized stokes parameters .",
    "the data presented in this paper were processed using a new scattered power correction algorithm that can be used to correct digitization distortions to folded pulsar profiles . in the case of two - bit sampled voltages , the scattered power ( or quantization noise )",
    "is @xmath168% of the total power .",
    "the derivation of the method starts with the mean digitized power @xmath169 given by equation ( a5 ) of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ja98 ) , @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the fraction of samples that fall between the chosen thresholds , @xmath172 is the digitized power as a function of @xmath171 , given by equation ( a4 ) of ja98 , and @xmath75 is the discrete probability distribution for @xmath171 , given by equation ( a6 ) of ja98 .",
    "the parameter @xmath171 is eliminated by the summation in the above equation ; however , both @xmath172 and @xmath75 are also parameterized by the expectation value @xmath173 .",
    "therefore , equation  ( [ eqn : a5 ] ) represents the relationship between the mean digitized power and the mean value of @xmath171 .",
    "that is , given the mean digitized power @xmath169 , equation  ( [ eqn : a5 ] ) can be inverted to compute @xmath173 , which can in turn be used to estimate the mean undigitized power @xmath174 and the mean scattered power @xmath175 via equations ( 45 ) and ( 43 ) of ja98 , respectively .",
    "equation  ( a5 ) of ja98 can be inverted using the newton - raphson method and the partial derivatives of equations ( a4 ) through ( a6 ) of ja98 with respect to @xmath173 .",
    "these are simplified in the case of two - bit sampling by noting that equation ( a4 ) of ja98 reduces to @xmath176 where @xmath177 and @xmath178 are given by equations ( 41 ) and ( 40 ) of ja98 .",
    "the folded profile scattered power correction algorithm is based on the following assumptions and approximations .",
    "first , at the time of recording the astronomical signal , it is necessary that the baseband voltages are sampled using the optimum two - bit input thresholds defined in table 1 of ja98 . to first order , this condition",
    "is satisfied by excluding data with excessive two - bit distortion as defined by equation  ( [ eqn : d2bit ] ) of this paper .",
    "second , equations ( 45 ) and ( 43 ) of ja98 only approximately relate the expectation values of @xmath171 , @xmath174 and @xmath179 . for example",
    ", the relationship between @xmath179 and @xmath174 defined by equation ( 43 ) of ja98 is concave down ( see figure 3 of ja98 ) ; therefore , jensen s inequality dictates that the value of @xmath179 estimated from the mean undigitized power will be greater than the expectation value of @xmath179 .",
    "consequently , the mean fractional scattered power may be systematically underestimated .",
    "this limitation can not be overcome without prior knowledge of the distribution of total intensity fluctuations intrinsic to the pulsar signal .",
    "finally , it is assumed that the signal in each frequency channel has not been significantly altered , such that there is a well - defined relationship between the mean undigitized power and the mean digitized power .",
    "for example , after phase - coherent dedispersion removal , the flux density over a given time interval no longer represents the voltage fluctuations in the digitizer over that interval ; the previously smeared pulsar signal will be recovered and the scattered power will be smeared . to estimate the scattered power using coherently - dedispersed digitized power , the dispersion smearing in each frequency channel must be less than or of the order of the time resolution of the folded profile .",
    "this condition is satisfied in the 20-cm timing observations of psrj0437@xmath04715and psrj1022@xmath11001  presented in this paper .                  , d.  j. , hobbs , g.  b. , manchester , r.  n. , edwards , r.  t. , backer , d.  c. , bailes , m. , bhat , n.  d.  r. , burke - spolaor , s. , coles , w. , demorest , p.  b. , ferdman , r.  d. , folkner , w.  m. , hotan , a.  w. , kramer , m. , lommen , a.  n. , nice , d.  j. , purver , m.  b. , sarkissian , j.  m. , stairs , i.  h. , van straten , w. , verbiest , j.  p.  w. , & yardley , d.  r.  b. 2010 , apj , 720 , l201                                                                      manchester , r.  n. , hobbs , g. , bailes , m. , coles , w.  a. , van straten , w. , keith , m.  j. , shannon , r.  m. , bhat , n.  d.  r. , brown , a. , burke - spolaor , s.  g. , champion , d.  j. , chaudhary , a. , edwards , r.  t. , hampson , g. , hotan , a.  w. , jameson , a. , jenet , f.  a. , kesteven , m.  j. , khoo , j. , kocz , j. , maciesiak , k. , oslowski , s. , ravi , v. , reynolds , j.  r. , sarkissian , j.  m. , verbiest , j.  p.  w. , wen , z.  l. , wilson , w.  e. , yardley , d. , yan , w.  m. , & you , x.  p. 2012",

    "<S> a new method of polarimetric calibration is presented in which the instrumental response is derived from regular observations of psrj0437@xmath04715 based on the assumption that the mean polarized emission from this millisecond pulsar remains constant over time . </S>",
    "<S> the technique is applicable to any experiment in which high - fidelity polarimetry is required over long time scales ; it is demonstrated by calibrating 7.2  years of high - precision timing observations of psrj1022@xmath11001  made at the parkes observatory . </S>",
    "<S> application of the new technique followed by arrival time estimation using matrix template matching yields post - fit residuals with an uncertainty - weighted standard deviation of 880  ns , two times smaller than that of arrival time residuals obtained via conventional methods of calibration and arrival time estimation . </S>",
    "<S> the precision achieved by this experiment yields the first significant measurements of the secular variation of the projected semi - major axis , the precession of periastron , and the shapiro delay ; it also places psrj1022@xmath11001  among the ten best pulsars regularly observed as part of the parkes pulsar timing array ( ppta ) project . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the timing accuracy of a large fraction of the pulsars in the ppta is currently limited by the systematic timing error due to instrumental polarization artifacts . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , long - term variations of systematic error are correlated between different pulsars , which adversely affects the primary objectives of any pulsar timing array experiment . </S>",
    "<S> these limitations may be overcome by adopting the techniques presented in this work , which relax the demand for instrumental polarization purity and thereby have the potential to reduce the development cost of next - generation telescopes such as the square kilometre array . </S>"
