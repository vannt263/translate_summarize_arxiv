    "there has been an intense activity in the field of cold atoms in the last two decades @xcite . since the first realizations of bose - einstein condensation @xcite , new experimental developments involving the cooling and confinement of particles in optical traps led to a new chapter in many - body quantum systems , where the particle statistics is the main interest rather than individual atoms .",

    "non - interacting fermions exhibit non - trivial quantum effects , arising from pauli exclusion principle .",
    "while confined bosons may collapse to the lowest level of the trap , fermions are forced to dilute and behave as a strongly correlated system , regardless of their original interaction .",
    "this induces a fermi motion of the particles , which is a purely quantum phenomenon : it downplays to some extent the importance of individual interactions among the fermions , which can be , in many cases , neglected or treated as a small perturbation @xcite .",
    "this turns the _ ideal _ fermi gas into the natural playground to explore the properties of more general fermi gases .",
    "consider a one - dimensional fermi gas of @xmath6 particles confined by a harmonic potential @xmath12 , where the subscript @xmath13 stands for the quantum potential .",

    "this corresponds to filling each single - particle energy level from @xmath31 to @xmath32 with a single fermion .",
