    "charnonium is one of the simplest quark - antiquark composite particles .",
    "charmonium physics has played an important role in the study of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) both perturbatively and nonperturbatively , since the first charmonium state @xmath2 was discovered in 1974 . during the past decade",
    ", the study of charmonium has become more interesting because of the large difference between the predictions of the color - singlet model and the observations of @xmath2 and @xmath15 production at several experimental facilities e.g. at the fermilab tevatron @xcite .",
    "the newly developed nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) factorization formalism @xcite allows the infrared safe calculation of inclusive heavy quarkonium production and decay rates . in the nrqcd production mechanism , a heavy quark - antiquark pair can be produced at short distances in a conventional color - singlet or a color - octet state , and then evolves into an observed quarkonium nonperturbatively . with this color - octet mechanism",
    ", one may explain the tevatron data on the surplus production of @xmath16 and @xmath17 at large @xmath18 , though puzzles about their polarizations still remain ( for a recent review see @xcite and references therein ) .    to further test the color octet mechanism ,",
    "it is interesting to study the charmonium production in @xmath14 annihilation .",
    "the @xmath2 inclusive production in @xmath14 annihilation has been investigated within the color - singlet model @xcite and the color - octet model @xcite .",
    "the angular distribution and energy distribution of color - singlet @xmath2 production at @xmath19 have been discussed in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it is found that a clean signature of the color - octet mechanism may be observed in the angular distribution of @xmath2 production near the end point region . in @xcite contributions of various color - octet as well as color - singlet channels to the @xmath2 production cross sections are calculated in a wide range of @xmath14 collider energies .",
    "moreover , the @xmath2 polarizations are predicted in @xcite .",
    "recently , babar @xcite and belle @xcite have measured the direct @xmath2 production in continuum @xmath14 annihilations at @xmath19 .",
    "the total cross section and the angular distribution seem to favor the nrqcd calculation over the color - singlet model @xcite , but some issues ( e.g. about the momentum distribution and polarization of @xmath2 ) still remain .",
    "the situation has become even more complicated due to the very recent observation for the double @xmath20 production associated with @xmath2 by belle@xcite .",
    "the measured exclusive cross section for @xmath21 process is an order of magnitude larger than the theoretical value@xcite , and the measured inclusive cross section for @xmath22 ( @xmath70.9 pb)@xcite is more than five times larger than nrqcd predictions which are only about 0.1 - 0.2 pb@xcite taking into account the differences in the values of the input parameters or methods . among other attempts to solve the @xmath23 inclusive production problem@xcite ,",
    "@xmath5 annihilation into two photons was also studied@xcite , but the two photon contribution turned to be negligible at @xmath10gev , though it could prevail over one photon contribution at higher energies ( say , @xmath24gev)@xcite .",
    "the double @xmath20 production associated with @xmath2 ( both exclusively and inclusively ) is very puzzling and needs a better understanding for both perturbative and nonperturbative qcd . on the other hand , experimentally , it is not clear whether the copious ( even dominant ) double @xmath20 production will also happen for charmonium states other than @xmath2 , such as @xmath1 and @xmath3(j=0 , 1 , 2 ) . among them",
    "the @xmath8 and @xmath9 are more interesting since they have large branching fractions decaying into @xmath25 and might be easier to be detected .",
    "in fact , in ref .",
    "@xcite the inclusive production for @xmath8 and @xmath9 was searched for with the available integrated luminosity of about 30 fb@xmath26 at belle .",
    "as more data are collected in the near future at b factories we hope that more accurate measurements for the p - wave and other s - wave charmonium states will be possible .",
    "these measurements will be helpful to clarify the problems associated with @xmath2",
    "double @xmath4 production .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the calculations for inclusive s - wave and p - wave charmonia production via double @xmath4 are necessary in the framework of nrqcd , including both the color - singlet and color - octet contributions .",
    "when we know the differences between nrqcd predictions and experimental data , we will have to further consider other mechanisms and methods in qcd to explain the differences .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we will calculate the complete @xmath27@xmath28 color - singlet inclusive production cross sections for @xmath1 and @xmath3(j=0,1,2 ) ( along with @xmath2 ) via double @xmath4 in @xmath5 annihilation through a virtual photon .",
    "then we will compare the complete calculation with the calculation obtained in the charm quark fragmentation limit , and give their ratio as functions of the center - of - mass energies and determine the energy scales at which fragmentation approximations become reliable . in section 3 , we will further estimate the color - octet contributions to @xmath2 and @xmath3 inclusive cross sections via double charm .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section 4 .",

    ", the coefficient @xmath35 can be related to the origin of the radial wave function ( or its derivative ) of the bound state as @xmath36    the spin projection operator can be defined as@xcite @xmath37    we list the spin projection operators and their derivatives with respect to the relative momentum , which we will use in the calculations , as @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40.\\ ] ]    for p - wave states we need further relations to reduce the polarizations @xmath41 where m is the mass of the charmonium , which equals to @xmath42 in the nonrelativistic approximation .",
    "the calculation of cross sections for @xmath43 charmonium @xmath44 is straightforward . using the definition in ref .",
    "@xcite we get the differential cross section as follows @xmath45 where l = s for s - wave , l = p for p - wave and @xmath46 .",

    ", the approximate fragmentation results will be equivalent to the complete calculations .",
    "this is another check for the validity of the complete calculation . here",
    "the fragmentation cross sections are written as    @xmath59    where @xmath60 are the charm quark fragmentation functions into s - wave@xcite or p - wave@xcite charmonia .",

    "[ fig1]-[fig5 ] .",
    "all these cross sections are in units of @xmath61 , the cross section for @xmath62 annihilating into the @xmath4 quark pair , times @xmath63 .",
    "one can find that the cross sections in complete calculations and fragmentation approximations ( all in units of the cross section for @xmath62 annihilating to the @xmath4 pair ) are proportional to the fragmentation probabilities for the charm quark fragmentating into charmonia when the @xmath64 limit is valid .",
    "this is just what the fragmentation approach describes .",
    "the results in these figures show that except for @xmath65 , the differences between fragmentation results and complete calculations are large at low energies . at the belle and babar energy @xmath6=10.6gev ,",
    "the ratios of complete calculations to fragmentation calculations are @xmath66 for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 respectively . as the center - of - mass energy increases , the ratios of complete calculations to fragmentation results increase and can reach to @xmath67 when the center - of - mass energy is over 100 gev . moreover , the cross sections are rather sensitive to the input parameters . if we choose @xmath68 , and @xmath69 at @xmath10gev , the cross sections for @xmath70 , and @xmath3 ( j=0,1,2 ) become 77.0fb ,",
    "192fb , 64.2fb , 18.3fb , 8.48fb respectively .",
    "we next estimate the color - octet contribution to @xmath2 and @xmath3 production via double @xmath4 in @xmath14 annihilation .",
    "the feynman diagrams are showed in fig  [ feynman ] and fig  [ fey2 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ feynman ] , the charmonium comes from the color - octet mediate states @xmath71 by emitting soft gluons at long distances . here",

    "the color - octet contribution is significant , which is about @xmath85 of the color - singlet cross section . with the approximation of heavy quark spin symmetry ,",
