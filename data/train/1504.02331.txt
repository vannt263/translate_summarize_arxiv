    "some time ago takahashi made the argument for the plausible existence of transverse ward takahashi(wt ) relation in canonical field theory , which has the potential to restrict the transverse vertex function from gauge symmetry alone[1 ] .",
    "subsequently these transverse wt relations for the fermion - boson vertex in coordinate space ( or in momentum space ) are cast in four - dimensional abelian gauge theory by computing the curl of the time ordered products of three - point green functions [ 2,3 ] .",
    "in addition , the proposed transverse wt relation holds at one - loop order level in four dimensions gauge theory[4 ] . up to the effect of quantum anomaly , the possible anomaly for the transverse ward - takahashi relations in four dimensional gauge theories is studies by he using the point - splitting method[5 ] .",
    "recently , the anomaly issue reexamined by means of perturbative method .",
    "the conclusion is that there are no transverse anomalies for both the axial vector and vector current [ 6 ] .",
    "also the path - integral derivation of the transverse wt relation for the vector vertex is presented due to a set of infinitesimal transformation of field variable in qed in refs.[7,8 ] , wherein topological property of the axial - vector current has been illustrated in terms of atiyah - singer index theorem .",
    "based on the validity of fujikawa s analysis , we reevaluate in detail the transverse anomaly of the transverse wt identity for the axial - vector and vector vertex in the qed , we find that a careful application of fujikawa s approach leads to a transverse quantum anomaly for the axial vector current.[9 ] . in this paper",
    ", we point out that the mathematical explanation of such a anomaly is directly related to atiyah - singer index theorem .",
    "the topological index for dirac operator corresponding to the anomaly will be expressed .",
    "from the point of view of path - integral formulation , we proposed a infinitesimal transverse transformation of field variables to derive the wt identities[7][9 ] .",
    "let us consider a set of infinitesimal local transformation in the qed    @xmath0    where @xmath1 stands for the antisymmetry tensor,@xmath2 and @xmath3 are the fermion and gauge fields , respectively . + in principle , the variation of the generating functional itself under the transformation of field variables eq.@xmath4 can lead to ward - takahashi type s identities .the change of the function integral due to the transformation ( choosing @xmath5 for simplicity ) gives the relation in momentum space in qed @xmath6 this wt relation for the vector current has been listed in ref.[9 ] .",

    "is defined as    @xmath10    2 where @xmath11 .",
    "obviously , the full vector function and the full axial -vector function are coupled with each other.as shown is ref[3 ] ,",
    "the apparent feature of this transverse identity eq.(2 ) is that the vertex function @xmath12 ( fermion s three point function ) has the transverse component of itself .",
    "completely analogous to the calculations above , let us consider the other transverse transformation @xmath13 we obtain the identity for the axial -vector current in momentum space as    @xmath14    2 according to fujikawa s interpretation , it is argued that the appearance of the quantum anomaly in wt identity is a symptom of the impossibility of defining a suitably invariant functional integral measure due to the relevant transformations on fermionic field variables.the regularization procedure for the variations of the integral measure can provide access to a wider class of such anomaly objects [ 11][12][13][14].to see how the change of the measure corresponding to the transverse transformation eq.(1)and eq.(4 ) gives rise to a possible anomaly factor , let us consider an abelian gauge field to show our argument .",
