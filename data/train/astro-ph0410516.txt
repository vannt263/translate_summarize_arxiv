    "candidates for stellar  mass black holes have preferentially been found as x - ray sources in binary systems by radial velocity measurements of the optically visible companion star .",
    "such measurements allow , however , only the determination of the mass functions @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the orbital period , @xmath4 is the semi amplitude of the companion star s radial velocity curve and @xmath5 is the constant of gravity . @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the masses of the black hole and the companion star , respectively .",
    "@xmath8 denotes the inclination of the orbital plane to the line of sight in the sense that @xmath9 , if the orbit is seen edge - on .",
    "the inclination angle is not known from the radial velocity curve .",
    "if the latter is combined with the light curve and a measurement of the projected rotational velocity broadening of the spectral lines of the companion star , @xmath8  can sometimes be estimated indirectly ( orosz 2003 ) .",
    "a direct , much more accurate determination of the mass of the black hole is possible , if the orbit of the companion star is observed also astrometrically . a precise measurement of the black hole mass would help to constrain the radius of the last stable orbit around the black hole . if the orbital period of material on such an orbit can be identified by intensity fluctuations of the system",
    ", this would be a physical experiment of great significance , because it would prove the existence of event horizons and allow the measurement of the spin parameter of the black hole .",
    "we have examined the objects given in the compilations of orosz ( 2003 ) and tanaka & lewin ( 1995 ) and tested whether the orbits of the companion stars can be observed with gaia .",
    "we have found five objects for which the semi - major axis of the astrometric orbits exceed 10  micro - arcseconds , although four of them seem to be too faint to be actually measured by gaia .",
    "orbits of these four could in principle be detected by the sim space interferometer , but would require a very significant amount of observing time .",
    "the parameters of the systems as well as distances and mass estimates for the black holes have been adopted from orosz ( 2003 ) , tanaka & lewin ( 1995 ) and references therein and are given in table 1 for the five objects .",
    "the semi  major axis of the relative orbit of the black hole and companion star , @xmath10 , has been calculated with kepler s law @xmath11 and then converted to the _ observable _ semi major axis of the orbit of the companion star projected onto the sky using the relation @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the distance of the system from the sun . in eq .",
    "( 3 ) we assume that the accretion disk around the black hole is optically much fainter than the star .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we conclude from table  1 that the orbit of the companion star hd226868 of cyg  x-1 should be observable accurately with gaia .",
    "in addition to the astrometry , high resolution spectroscopy of the companion star is required in order to verify the assumption that the disk is faint : the spectral energy distribution will reveal emission from the disk .",
    "furthermore , light reflected from the accretion disk can be detected and measured by doppler  shifted binary spectral lines , because the star and the black hole move in opposite directions .",
    "such a contamination is not expected for cyg  x-1 . however , in some of the transient x - ray sources light from the disk could significantly contribute to the system s total light .",
    "the astrometric data must then be reduced as described by wielen  et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss only those nearby stellar black - hole candidates that are already known .",
    "however , gould and salim ( 2002 ) point out that there is a possibility that gaia will find many more , if the ( presently hypothetical ) `` failed supernovae '' ",
    "i.e.  massive stars that directly collapse to black holes instead of exploding  do indeed occur .",
