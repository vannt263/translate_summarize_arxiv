    "recently , phases of the inhomogeneous chiral condensates ( ichcs ) have attracted renewed attention in the quark matter context @xcite . a number of studies based on the njl - type model @xcite as well as models with the infrared ( ir ) enhanced interactions @xcite have suggested that in some domain of moderate quark density the ichc phases are energetically more favored than the normal , chiral symmetric phase .",
    "in particular , the njl - type model studies indicate that the phase of ichc may mask the usual first - order chiral phase transition line and its critical end point , and might change the conventional wisdom .",
    "so far , most studies have been concentrated on the chiral condensates of the liquid crystal type , in which the condensates spatially modulate in one particular direction ( say , the @xmath0 direction ) , while they are uniform in the other two directions .",
    "for the description of such phases , the model studies rely on the understanding of their two - dimensional counterparts : the gross - neveu ( gn ) model @xcite as a counterpart for the njl@xmath1 model @xcite , the t hooft model ( qcd@xmath2 ) @xcite for the confining model @xcite , and the njl@xmath2 model @xcite for the extended njl@xmath1 model with tensor 4-fermi interactions @xcite .",
    "in fact , the solutions of two - dimensional models can be naturally embedded into the four - dimensional mean field ansatz .",
    "the inhomogeneous solutions for two - dimensional models are similar but not quite identical .",
    "the qcd@xmath2 and njl@xmath2 models are known to have the chiral spiral ground states , @xmath3 which can be directly brought into its four - dimensional version by replacing @xmath4 .",
    "( this solution should _ not _ be confused with the pionic chirals such as @xmath5 or @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "can be used to understand differences between these two types of chiral spirals . ] ) here @xmath8 appears because of the condensed pairs of comoving particle - holes near the fermi surface . on the other hand , for the gn model ,",
    "the spiral solution is usually not considered , because the 4-fermi interaction takes the form @xmath9 , so that its mean - field thermodynamic functional depends only on @xmath10 but not on @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , the above two classes of solutions are usually distinguished .    in this paper",
    "we explain how to understand differences between them by revisiting inhomogeneous solutions of the gn model @xcite . to avoid confusion",
    ", we emphasize that we will not attempt to modify the analytic solution , which was shown to achieve the ground state @xcite . on the other hand , there are physical implications which can not be observed from the expression of the thermodynamic functional .",
    "in fact , not all condensates manifestly appear in the energy minimization procedure .    using the",
    "analytically known fermion eigenstates , we compute condensates explicitly to show that the inhomogeneous condensate in the gn model actually takes the chiral spiral form .",
    "it is , however , not identical with those in qcd@xmath2 ( njl@xmath2 ) . in the gn model ,",
    "the net contribution to the chiral scalar density comes from the dirac sea , while that for the chiral pseudoscalar density comes from the fermi sea .",
    "this introduces disparities in amplitudes of two densities .",
    "this chiral spiral solution in the gn model can be elevated to the njl@xmath1 model . like the gn model case , the corresponding chiral spiral  which is made of @xmath12 and @xmath13cannot be observed from the thermodynamic functional in the njl@xmath1 model , and it must be computed using the fermion bases in the scalar mean field of ref .",
    "we will show the explicit mapping from two to four dimensions in another publication , but we think that the main features should already be clear from our two - dimensional analyses in this paper .",
    "actually , for the discussions of the qcd phase diagram , the derivation of the chiral spirals in the njl@xmath1 model is not the end of the story .",
    "it leads to broader implications once we start to think of fundamental theories behind the effective models .    for the njl@xmath1 model up to dimension-6 operators , in principle we should include all possible 4-fermi interactions that are compatible with symmetries of qcd , although many of them can be discarded based on other set of arguments . for example , in vacuum , it does not matter whether or not we include tensor type interactions @xmath14 , simply because the tensor mean field is zero , not because the coupling constant is small ( there are no reasons why the coupling should be very small ) .",
    "the only important mean field comes from the scalar density , so that terms @xmath15 are enough to take into account relevant dynamical effects and , at the same time , maintain the chiral symmetry .",
    "the situation is different for inhomogeneous phases . as explained above ,",
    "the spatially modulating scalar density drives the spatial modulation of the tensor mean field @xmath16 whose amplitude is comparable to the scalar one . in this case , the relevance of the tensor - type interactions is dynamically enhanced , so we have to reanalyze the mean field solutions in the presence of such interactions .",
    "if the new mean fields turn out to generate another mean field , again we have to include the corresponding 4-fermi interactions and reanalyze dynamics from the beginning .",
    "this procedure should be repeated until we exhaust all possible dynamically enhanced 4-fermi interactions and mean fields .",
    "after that , we can pick out the effective models for the inhomogeneous phase .",

    "( [ scalarintegral ] ) ] , @xmath252 the condensate includes the contributions up to @xmath253 .",
    "this is the reason why the scalar density is proportional to @xmath254 .    on the other hand , in the chiral pseudoscalar density , the dirac sea contributions from the first and second energy branches cancel , leaving only the fermi sea contribution , @xmath255 the amplitude is proportional to @xmath256 . due to the mismatch in the net contributions for the scalar and pseudoscalar density ,",
    "their amplitudes are naturally different in the gn model .",
    "when using this result as a guide for the qcd phase diagram , espcially when @xmath163 becomes larger than the vacuum quark effective mass , we should use the gn results with some caution .",
    "the above result strongly depends on the fact that the gaps in the fermi and dirac sea have the same size at the edge of the first energy branches .",
    "such large gaps in the dirac sea are rather specific to models with the contact interactions . in such models , although the condensation is initially driven by the low - energy particle - hole pairs near the fermi surface , the created condensate affects spectra all the way from the fermi surface down to the dirac sea .",
    "then the resulting gapped fermions in the dirac sea also contribute to the condensate , giving large feedback to the fermions near the fermi surface .",
    "therefore there is a tight connection between the structures of the fermi sea and dirac sea .",
    "in contrast , for models of the long - range interactions such as qcd , the physics near the fermi surface does not strongly affect the structure of the dirac sea .",
    "in fact , with momentum - dependent forces , the gap functions in general become momentum dependent .",
    "if we had used models of long - range interactions such as @xmath257 force , the gap would be large near the fermi surface but small otherwise .",
    "in particular , the chirality - violating effective mass tends to disappear in the dirac sea as fermion density becomes large @xcite .",
    "then the main contribution to both chiral scalar and pseudoscalar density comes from the fermi sea , and they tend to acquire the same amplitude . actually , this is what happens in models like qcd@xmath2 .      in the njl@xmath2 model ,",
    "the interaction is short range , as in the gn model",
    ". nevertheless , qualtiative aspects of the chiral condensates are more similar to qcd@xmath2 rather than the gn model .",
    "moreover , in contrast to the gn model , models in the latter class have an energy gap of @xmath246 instead of a decreasing gap at finite density , @xmath258 ( fig . [",
    "fig : fermidirac ] ) .",
    "the key observation to understanding all these tendencies is that for a particular set of 4-fermi interactions , physics near the fermi surface tends to decouple from physics in the dirac sea , as it happens for models with long - range interactions .    to explain this , first we project the fermion fields onto the right- and left - moving components , @xmath259 for free fermions , the field equation is given by @xmath260 from which we observe that the right components have positive energy for @xmath261 and negative energy for @xmath262 .",
    "the relation is opposite for the left components .",
    "now we express the 4-fermi interactions in terms of left and right components . for bookkeeping purposes , let @xmath263 the fourier transform of @xmath131 is @xmath264 @xmath265 notice that for @xmath266 , both of the fields @xmath267 and @xmath268 at small @xmath269 describe the fermion fields near the fermi points . if @xmath270 is very different from @xmath8 , either of the fields @xmath268 or @xmath267 in @xmath271 must be in the region far away from the fermi surface , costing more energy .",
    "this is the reason why the homogeneous condensation at @xmath272 tends to disappear at finite density while instead the inhomogeneous condensate of @xmath273 develops due to the condensed particle - hole pairs near the fermi surface .",
    "now we consider the 4-fermi interaction in the njl@xmath2 .",
    "it can be written as @xmath274 = 4\\int_x |\\phi(x)|^2   = 4\\int_q \\phi(q ) \\phi^*(q ) \\,,\\ ] ] note that the interaction couples @xmath271 with @xmath275 .",
    "when one @xmath271 is replaced with the mean field @xmath276 , it affects only @xmath277 in which left- and right - moving fermions can simultaneously stay at low energy for small @xmath269 , and also simultaneously go to high energy for large @xmath269 . phrasing this in another way , the mean field scatters low - energy fields to low energy , and high - energy fields to high energy , but it does not strongly mix up fields belonging to different energy domains .",
    "the meaning of the above statements becomes clearer if we consider the gn model .",
    "its 4-fermi interaction is @xmath278 = \\ ! \\int_q",
    "\\left[\\ , 2\\phi(q ) \\phi^*(q )   + \\phi(q ) \\phi(-q ) + \\phi^*(q ) \\phi^*(-q ) \\right]\\,,\\ ] ] where we find extra couplings , @xmath279 and @xmath280 .",
    "now imagine that we have a mean field , @xmath276 .",
    "then it couples to the composite field @xmath281 .",
    "but its content is @xmath282 at small @xmath269 , both fields are in the dirac sea according to the dispersion ( [ dispersion_rl ] ) . on the other hand , when the right field @xmath267 stays near the fermi surface , then @xmath283 , and the @xmath268 field is in the dirac sea with energy of @xmath284 .",
    "therefore , if the mean field is developed by condensation near the fermi surface , it inevitably couples the fields near the fermi surface to those in the dirac sea .",
    "this is the reason why the gn model has the sizable energy gap not only near the fermi surface but also in the dirac sea .",
    "furthermore , the feedback from the dirac sea condensation strongly affects the fermi surface condensations , making the inhomogeneous solutions far more complicated than those in the njl@xmath2 model .",
    "because of this feedback , the size of the mass gap in the gn model scales like @xmath258 , unlike @xmath246 in the njl@xmath2 model or qcd@xmath2 .",
    "perhaps it is already clear why the results of chiral condensates in njl@xmath2 and qcd@xmath2 are similar . in the former ,",
    "the combinations of the 4-fermi interactions are arranged in such a way that fields for the fermi surface do not strongly couple to those for the dirac sea . in the latter , the long - range interactions and the resulting momentum - dependent mass functions tend to forbid strong coupling between the fermi surface and dirac sea . in both cases , physics are governed by dynamics near the fermi surface .",
    "in this paper , we have argued that the inhomogeneous chiral condensate in the gn model takes the chiral spiral form .",
    "although the thermodynamic functional does not depend on the pseudoscalar density manifestly , the spatial modulations of the chiral scalar density inevitably generate the pseudoscalar density modulations .    while our arguments add little for the understanding of the gn model , the implications will become important once we start to infer proper effective models at finite quark density from more general perspectives on the fundamental theories . for assumed mean fields",
    ", we should calculate not only the thermodynamic functional but also various operators which might acquire large expectation values .",
    "once such operators are found , we have to reanalyze the effective models including the interaction terms related to such operators , unless there is some reason to discard them . for the njl@xmath1 up to dimensions-6 operators ,",
    "it is perhaps unavoidable to add @xmath285-type 4-fermi interactions whose two - dimensional counterpart is @xmath286 .",
    "this is an approach pursued in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have also contrasted the gn model with the njl@xmath2 model and qcd@xmath2 to understand the structure of the chiral spirals and the parametric behaviors of the mass gaps . in the gn model , the specific form of the 4-fermi interaction and its short - range properties together create a strong fermi - dirac sea coupling which deforms the dirac sea , even producing the energy gap inside the dirac sea .",
    "if the interaction is replaced with the long - range one , such strong deformation of the dirac sea tends to disappear .",
    "similar results can be found if we arrange the 4-fermi interactions in such a way as to weaken couplings between the fermi and dirac seas , as happened in the njl@xmath2 model .",
    "we found it very interesting that simple arrangements of the 4-fermi interactions can control the coupling between the fermi and dirac sea contributions . even within models with contact interactions , we can reproduce results similar to those in models with long - range interactions .",
    "perhaps we may use the above kinematic considerations as a guide to restrict possible forms of the effective models at finite density , in addition to the ordinary symmetry considerations .",
    "more implications from the gn model studies to the results of the njl@xmath1 model will be discussed elsewhere .",
