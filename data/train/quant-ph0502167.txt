    "<S> the bases can be reinterpreted as quantum phase states , i.e. as eigenvectors of hermitean phase operators generalizing those introduced by pegg & barnett in 1989 . </S>",
    "<S> the mub states are related to additive characters of galois fields ( in odd characteristic p ) and of galois rings ( in characteristic 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> quantum fourier transforms of the components in vectors of the bases define a more general class of mubs with multiplicative characters and additive ones altogether . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the complementary properties of the above phase operator with respect to the number operator . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the phase probability distribution and variance for physical states and find them related to the gauss sums , which are sums over all elements of the field ( or of the ring ) of the product of multiplicative and additive characters .    </S>",
    "<S> finally we relate the concepts of mutual unbiasedness and maximal entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> this allows to use well studied algebraic concepts as efficient tools in our quest of minimal uncertainty in quantum information primitives . </S>"
