    "let @xmath6 be the open unit disk , let @xmath7 be normalized area measure on @xmath6 , and let @xmath8 be the space of holomorphic functions on @xmath6 . given a non - negative function @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    ", we define @xmath11 the _ weighted dirichlet space _ @xmath1 is the set of @xmath10 with @xmath12 .",
    "obviously , if @xmath13 , then @xmath1 is just the classical dirichlet space @xmath14 .    in this article",
    "we shall be mainly interested in the case where @xmath2 is a superharmonic weight .",
    "this class of weights was introduced by aleman @xcite . for such @xmath2",
    ", we automatically have @xmath15 , and , provided that @xmath16 , we also have @xmath17 , the hardy space . it is customary to define @xmath18 making @xmath1 a hilbert space .",
    "the class of superharmonic weights includes two important subclasses :    * the power weights @xmath19 , which form a scale linking the classical dirichlet space ( @xmath20 ) to the hardy space ( @xmath21 ) . * the harmonic weights , introduced by richter @xcite in connection with his analysis of shift - invariant subspaces of the classical dirichlet space .",
    "superharmonic weights have the important property that the dilates of @xmath3 of each function @xmath22 satisfy @xmath23 where @xmath24 is an absolute constant . from this , it is not hard to deduce that @xmath25 as @xmath26 , and that polynomials are dense in @xmath1 .",
    "inequality was first proved by richter and sundberg @xcite in the case where @xmath2 is harmonic , with @xmath27 .",
    "it was generalized to superharmonic weights by aleman @xcite , with an improved constant @xmath28 . for harmonic weights ,",
    "the constant was further improved to @xmath29 by sarason @xcite .",
    "the basis of sarason s method was to show that , if @xmath30 ( the poisson kernel at a point @xmath31 ) , then it is possible to identify @xmath1 as a de branges  rovnyak space @xmath32 , the norms being identical ( we shall define @xmath32 later ) .",
    "working within @xmath32 , one can deduce that holds with @xmath29 , at least for these special @xmath2 .",
    "inequality for general harmonic @xmath2 then follows easily by using an averaging argument .",
    "it turns out that sarason s construction has a sort of converse .",
    "the only harmonic weights @xmath2 for which @xmath1 can be identified as a de branges  rovnyak space are multiples of @xmath33 , where @xmath31 .",
    "this was proved in @xcite .",
    "( one can also study a weaker notion of ` identified ' , where the spaces @xmath1 and @xmath32 are allowed to carry different norms .",
    "this appears to be more subtle : see @xcite . )",
    "our purpose in this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we shall extend sarason s result by exhibiting a new family of superharmonic weights @xmath2 for which @xmath1 can be identified as a de branges  rovnyak space @xmath32 .",
    "we shall deduce from this that the inequality holds with @xmath29 for all superharmonic weights .",
    "second , we shall prove a converse result , characterizing those superharmonic weights @xmath2 for which @xmath1 is equal to an @xmath32 .",
    "we shall also consider what happens for more general weights .",
    "let @xmath2 be a positive superharmonic function on @xmath6 .    by standard results from potential theory , @xmath2 is locally integrable on @xmath6 , and @xmath34 is a decreasing function of @xmath4 for @xmath35 .",
    "it follows that @xmath15 , so it is admissible as a dirichlet weight .",
    "now suppose that @xmath16 .",
    "we shall show that @xmath17 . by the minimum principle @xmath36 for all @xmath37 ( possibly infinite at some points ) . by lower semicontinuity , @xmath38 is attained and therefore @xmath39 . by the minimum principle",
    "again , @xmath40 for all @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "since the dirichlet space with weight @xmath43 is just @xmath44 , it follows easily that @xmath17 , as claimed .",
    "it thus makes sense to define the norm @xmath45 on @xmath1 by @xmath46 with respect to this norm , @xmath1 is a hilbert space .",
    "we shall make extensive use of the following representation formula for positive superharmonic functions @xmath2 on @xmath6 .",
    "given such an @xmath2 , there exists a unique positive finite borel measure @xmath47 on @xmath48 such that , for all @xmath37 , @xmath49 ( this is the usual decomposition of @xmath2 as a potential plus a harmonic function . ) we then write @xmath50 for @xmath1 , and further @xmath51 for @xmath52 . thus ,",
    "for @xmath10 , @xmath53 for general @xmath47 , we can recover @xmath54 from @xmath55 via fubini s theorem : @xmath56    finally , we shall need the following douglas - type formula for @xmath55 .    [",
    "t : douglas ] let @xmath57 and let @xmath58 . if @xmath59 , then @xmath60 if @xmath31 and @xmath61 exists , then the same formula holds .",
    "otherwise @xmath62 .    for a proof , and more background on superharmonic weights ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the de branges  rovnyak spaces are a family of ( not necessarily closed ) subspaces @xmath32 of @xmath44 , parametrized by elements @xmath63 of the closed unit ball of @xmath64 .",
    "they were introduced by de branges and rovnyak in the appendix of @xcite and further studied in @xcite . for background information",
    "we refer to the books of de branges and rovnyak @xcite , sarason @xcite , and the forthcoming monograph of fricain and mashreghi @xcite .",
    "given @xmath65 , we define the toeplitz operator @xmath66 by @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the orthogonal projection of @xmath69 onto @xmath44 .",
    "clearly @xmath70 is a bounded operator on @xmath44 , and its adjoint is @xmath71 .    given @xmath72 with @xmath73 , the _ de branges  rovnyak space _",
    "@xmath32 is defined as the image of @xmath44 under the operator @xmath74 .",
    "we put a norm on @xmath32 making @xmath75 a partial isometry from @xmath44 onto @xmath32 , namely @xmath76    we have defined @xmath32 as in sarason s book @xcite .",
    "the original definition of de branges and rovnyak , based on the notion of complementary space , is different but equivalent .",
    "an explanation of the equivalence can be found in @xcite .",
    "a third approach is to start from the positive kernel @xmath77 and to define @xmath32 as the reproducing kernel hilbert space associated with this kernel .",
    "the theory of @xmath32-spaces is pervaded by a fundamental dichotomy , namely whether @xmath63 is or is not an extreme point of the closed unit ball of @xmath64 .",
    "this is illustrated by following result .",
    "[ t : nonextreme ] let @xmath72 with @xmath78 .",
    "the following are equivalent :    * @xmath63 is a non - extreme point of the closed unit ball of @xmath64 ; * @xmath79 ; * @xmath32 contains all functions holomorphic in a neighborhood of @xmath48 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath63 is non - extreme , then the polynomials are dense in @xmath32 .",
    "the equivalence between ( i ) and ( ii ) is proved in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  7.9 ) . that ( i ) implies ( iii ) is proved in @xcite , and that ( iii ) implies ( i ) follows from @xcite .",
    "finally , the density of polynomials when @xmath63 is non - extreme is proved in @xcite ; a constructive proof of this result is given in @xcite .",
    "henceforth we shall simply say that @xmath63 is ` extreme ' or ` non - extreme ' , it being understood that this relative to the closed unit ball of @xmath64 .    from the equivalence between ( i ) and ( ii )",
    ", it follows that , if @xmath63 is non - extreme , then there exists a unique outer function @xmath80 such that @xmath81 and @xmath82 a.e .  on @xmath83 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we shall call @xmath84 a _ pair_.",
    "the following result gives a useful characterization of @xmath32 in this case .",
    "[ t : f+ ] let @xmath63 be non - extreme , let @xmath84 be a pair and let @xmath57",
    ". then @xmath85 if and only if @xmath86 . in this case",
    ", there exists a unique function @xmath87 such that @xmath88 , and @xmath89    given a pair @xmath84 , the function @xmath90 is the quotient of two functions in @xmath64 , the denominator being outer . in other words , @xmath91 , the smirnov class .",
    "conversely , given @xmath91 , we can write @xmath92 , where @xmath93 and @xmath80 is outer . multiplying @xmath80 and @xmath63 by an appropriately chosen outer function , we may further ensure that @xmath82 a.e .  on @xmath83 and that @xmath81 , in other words , that @xmath84 is a pair .",
    "then @xmath80 and @xmath63 are uniquely determined .",
    "there is thus a bijection @xmath94 between non - extreme functions @xmath63 and elements @xmath95 of the smirnov class .",
    "note that @xmath63 and @xmath95 have the same inner factor .",
    "also @xmath95 is bounded if and only if @xmath96 . in this case",
    ", @xmath97 is an invertible operator on @xmath44 , and consequently @xmath98 as vector spaces , although the norms may be different .",
    "our goal in this section is to establish the following theorem and examine one of its consequences .",
    "[ t : dmu = hb ] let @xmath58 , and let @xmath72 be the function corresponding to @xmath99 . then @xmath100 with equality of norms .",
    "\\(1 ) this theorem extends sarason s result @xcite , which is the special case @xmath31 .",
    "\\(2 ) a computation shows that , with @xmath101 , we have @xmath102 where @xmath103 however , we do not need the precise formulas for @xmath63 and @xmath80 in what follows .    as the result",
    "is already known for @xmath31 , we shall concentrate on the case @xmath59 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath104 are both equal to @xmath44 as vector spaces , with equivalent norms . for @xmath51",
    "this follows from theorem  [ t : douglas ] , and for @xmath32 we already observed this to be true whenever @xmath95 is bounded .",
    "the content of the theorem is that the norms on @xmath51 and @xmath32 are in fact identical .    for @xmath105 ,",
    "let @xmath106 denote the cauchy kernel , namely @xmath107 it is enough to prove that @xmath108 when @xmath5 and @xmath109 are finite linear combinations of cauchy kernels , since such @xmath110 are dense in @xmath44 .",
    "by sesquilinearity , this reduces to checking that @xmath111 for all @xmath112 . as both sides of this last equation are holomorphic in @xmath113 and antiholomorphic in @xmath114 , it is sufficient to prove it in the case when @xmath115 .",
    "thus we need to show that @xmath116 for all @xmath105 . by and",
    ", this amounts to verifying that @xmath117 for all @xmath105 , which we now proceed to do .    on the one hand , by theorem  [ t : douglas ] , we have @xmath118 the cauchy kernel is the reproducing kernel for @xmath44 , so @xmath119 for all @xmath57 , and in particular @xmath120 .",
    "hence @xmath121    on the other hand , by a standard property of adjoints of multiplication operators acting on reproducing kernels , we have @xmath122 for all @xmath123 and @xmath105 .",
    "in particular this is true when @xmath124 and when @xmath125 , where @xmath84 is the pair with @xmath126 . in the notation of theorem  [ t : f+ ] , it follows that @xmath127 , whence @xmath128 thus @xmath129 for all @xmath105 , as desired .    using the same basic idea as in @xcite",
    ", we can use this theorem to deduce that holds for all superharmonic weights @xmath2 with constant @xmath29 .",
    "in fact , just as in @xcite , we have the following even stronger result .",
    "let @xmath47 be a finite positive measure on @xmath48 and let @xmath130 .",
    "then @xmath131    we prove the result for @xmath132 .",
    "the general case follows by integrating up and using .    by theorem  [ t : dmu = hb ] , we have @xmath133 , where @xmath84 is the pair for which @xmath134 .",
    "so we need to show that , with this choice of @xmath95 , we have @xmath135    given @xmath136 , we have @xmath137 and thus @xmath138 as @xmath80 is an outer function , @xmath139 is dense in @xmath44 , and so @xmath140 finally , an elementary computation shows that @xmath141 whence the result .",
    "theorem  [ t : dmu = hb ] furnishes a list of couples @xmath142 for which @xmath143 . in this section",
    "we prove a converse , which shows that , apart from scalar multiples taken in a natural sense , these are the only such couples . it generalizes a result of @xcite , where it was proved in the case when @xmath47 is a measure on @xmath83 .",
    "note that we may assume from the outset that @xmath63 is a non - extreme point of the closed unit ball of @xmath64 .",
    "indeed , if we are to have @xmath143 , then , since @xmath50 contains all functions holomorphic on a neighborhood of @xmath48 , the same must be true of @xmath32 . by theorem  [ t : nonextreme ] , this entails that @xmath63 is non - extreme .",
    "[ t : converse ] let @xmath47 be a finite positive measure on @xmath48 with @xmath144 .",
    "let @xmath84 be pair and let @xmath90 . then @xmath143 with equality of norms if and only if there exist @xmath58 and @xmath145 such that @xmath146    the ` if ' part follows directly from theorem  [ t : dmu = hb ] . for",
    "the ` only if ' , we observe that , if we have equality of norms , then @xmath147 for all @xmath5 in the space , in particular for @xmath148 , the cauchy kernels . performing similar calculations to those in the proof of theorem  [ t : dmu = hb ] ,",
    "we obtain the relation @xmath149 in particular @xmath150 .",
    "if we write @xmath151 as a taylor series , substitute it into the formula above , expand in powers of @xmath152 and @xmath153 , and equate coefficients , then we end up with the following relation between the moments of @xmath47 : @xmath154 in particular , we have @xmath155 .",
    "this can be re - written as @xmath156 , where @xmath157 .",
    "it follows that @xmath158 for some @xmath159 . substituting this back into formula , we find that @xmath160 , and so @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is a complex constant with @xmath163 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "we have identified those superharmonic weights @xmath2 for which @xmath1 is equal to a de branges  rovnyak space @xmath32 .",
    "what about more general weights ? in this section we obtain some results in this direction , leading to questions that we think are interesting in their own right .",
    "[ t : binner ] let @xmath63 be in the closed unit ball of @xmath64 . if there exists a weight @xmath2 with @xmath164 such that @xmath165 , with equality of norms , then @xmath63 is non - extreme and its inner factor is exactly @xmath41 .",
    "consequently the inner factor of the associated function @xmath95 is also @xmath41 .      that @xmath63 is non - extreme is proved just as in the remark preceding the proof of theorem  [ t : converse ] .",

    "we next characterize those weights @xmath2 for which @xmath1 is equal to some de branges  rovnyak space @xmath32 .",
    "there is no harm in normalizing @xmath2 so that @xmath176 .",
    "to state our result we need to introduce some notation . given @xmath177",

    "as remarked in the previous theorem , @xmath63 is non - extreme , so by theorem  [ t : nonextreme ] polynomials are dense in @xmath32 , and thus also in @xmath1 .",
    "this proves ( i ) and ( ii ) . for ( iii ) , note that equality of norms implies @xmath187 for all @xmath37 , where once again @xmath188 denotes the cauchy kernel .",

    "this establishes ( iii ) , and also shows that @xmath185 .",
    "now we prove the ` if ' .",

    "( ii ) implies that the cauchy kernels @xmath200 span a dense subspace of @xmath1 ( as they do for @xmath32 ) . it thus suffices to establish equality of norms , and by the same argument as in the proof of theorem  [ t : dmu = hb ] , it is enough to prove that @xmath201 for all @xmath37 .",
    "this boils down to showing that holds , which , with our definition of @xmath95 , is equivalent to equation of property  ( iii ) .",
