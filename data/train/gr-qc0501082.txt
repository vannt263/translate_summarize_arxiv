    "in spite of many recent developments , in particular in string theory and loop quantum gravity , the problem of quantization of general relativity is still an open one both from mathematical and physical points of view .",
    "a key point of general relativity is its close resemblance ( and yet not equivalence ) to an ordinary gauge theory .",
    "this is very clear in the first order ( vierbein ) formalism , where the dynamical variables are those suitable for a gauge theory of the poincar group .",
    "this has been the starting point of the loop quantum gravity approach too .",
    "this similarity led to various attempts to write down a regularized version of gr on a lattice .",
    "one of the most well - known is regge calculus @xcite , which is a natural and geometrically appealing way of discretizing gravity on a simplicial lattice .",
    "recently it has been an active field of research in connection with dynamical triangulations , two dimentional quantum gravity , and therefore with conformal field theory and string theory .",
    "one of the weak points of the simplicial lattice is that it is naturally related to the second order ( metric ) formalism of gr , so that its connection with gauge theory is rather obscure .",
    "the aim of this article is to continue the work started by m. caselle , a. dadda and l. magnea @xcite , to reformulate regge calculus in terms of dynamical variables belonging to the poincar group , so that it makes an explicit connection with gauge theory in general and wilson - like gauge theory on a lattice @xcite in particular .",
    "we have also found strict analogies between this approach and discrete ashtekar variables @xcite .",
    "we pursue this goal starting in section ii by summarizing the main results of @xcite in the second order formalism which consists of assigning the rotational degrees of freedom ( lorentz connection ) to the links of a dual metric complex ( voronoi complex ) of the original simplicial complex , so that they are functions of the translational degrees of freedom . in section iii and iv we formulate a first - order principle , in the sense of palatini , in which the independent variables are the lorentz connection and the normals to the @xmath0-faces .",
    "these normals are considered analogues of the @xmath1-bein in the continuum theory , and the connection matrices as the connection one - form in gr . in section",
    "v we prove , in the case of _ small deficit angles _ , that regge calculus is a solution in the first - order formalism .",
    "this result is not obvious if we vary independently the two sets of the variables above .",
    "moreover this equivalence for small deficit angles tells us that this first - order formalism has the effect of smoothing out some pathological configurations , like _ spikes _ , which affect regge calculus and",
    "might prevent the theory from having a smooth continuum limit .",
    "these _ spike _ configurations are in fact in the region of large deficit angles , where the first - order and second - order formalisms are not equivalent . in section",
    "vi we derive the general field equations for the connection matrices and for the @xmath1-bein . in section vii a measure for the path integral of this discrete theory of gravity is introduced and is shown to be locally invariant under @xmath2 . as a last step in section @xmath3 we propose a coupling of this discrete theory of gravity with fermionic matter .",
    "this coupling is entirely performed by following the general prescription of the continuum theory . in other formulations of gravity ( regge calculus and dynamical triangulations ) the coupling with fermionic matter",
    "is usually introduced _",
    "in 1961 t. regge @xcite ( see also @xcite for a recent and updated summary of regge calculus and its alternative approaches ) proposed a discretized version of general relativity now known as regge calculus .",
    "it is , mainly , based on the idea of substituting a piecewise - linear ( pl)-manifold for differential manifold . in particular , these are simplicial manifolds built by gluing together two distinct @xmath1-dimensional flat simplexes by one and only one @xmath0-dimensional face . the final product of this construction",
    "is called a simplicial complex , which owns the manifold structure if it has been made in such a way that each point of the simplicial complex has a neighbourhood homeomorphic to @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the simplicial manifolds , we consider , are orientable . on each @xmath5-dimensional simplex @xmath6 , called a _ hinge _ , a deficit angle @xmath7 is defined    @xmath8    where @xmath9 , @xmath10 is one of the @xmath11 @xmath1-dimensional simplices incident on @xmath6 , and @xmath12 its dihedral angles on @xmath6 .",
    "the dihedral angle of a @xmath1-simplex on the hinge is the angle between the @xmath0-dimentional faces that have the hinge in common . @xmath7 and",
    "the volume of the hinge @xmath13 can be expressed @xcite as functions of the squared length of the one - dimensional simplices ( edges ) of the complex .",
    "the einstein - regge action is , in analogy to the continuum case , a functional over the simplicial manifolds and depends on the incidence matrix of the simplicial complex @xcite and on the ( squared ) lengths of the edges .",
    "usually , in regge calculus , the incidence matrix is fixed , so that the action can be written as    @xmath14    the corresponding einstein equations @xcite are derived by requiring that the action is stationary under the variation of the length of the edges",
    ".    the original aim of this theory was to give approximate solutions of the einstein equations in the case in which the topology is known .",
    "the theory is , as stressed by regge himself , completely coordinate independent .",
    "it was pointed out in reference @xcite that a theory of regge calculus locally invariant under the poincar group can be formulated by choosing in every simplex an orthonormal reference frame . in this way",
    "every @xmath1-dimensional simplex , considered as a piece of @xmath4 , can be seen as local inertial reference frame , being flat , and an n - bein base can be chosen in it . as in the continuum theory , we need a connection between the reference frames of two simplexes that share a common @xmath0-dimensional simplex .",
    "= 8.0truecm = 8.0truecm    now we summarize and update some definitions and results of @xcite that will be useful for our future discussions .",
    "consider an hinge @xmath6 and let @xmath15 be its vertices .",
    "suppose that this hinge is shared by @xmath16 @xmath1-simplices ( see fig.1 ) @xmath17 whose vertices are labelled in this way    @xmath18    in each simplex @xmath19 we can choose an origin and an orthogonal reference frame .",
    "in this frame the vertices of the simplex @xmath19 have the following coordinates    @xmath20    given a @xmath1-dimensional simplicial complex , there exists a general procedure for defining the dual metric complex , called the voronoi dual @xcite @xcite @xcite ( see also @xcite for an easy treatment and calculation at the details ) .",
    "the @xmath1-dimensional voronoi polyhedron dual to a vertex @xmath21 of the simplicial complex is the set of the points of the simplicial complex closer to @xmath21 than to any other vertex , using the standard flat metric in the simplex .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath22-simplex of the simplicial complex is dual to a @xmath23-polyhedron in the dual voronoi complex , and the @xmath22-dimensional linear space identified by the @xmath22 simplex is orthogonal to the @xmath23 dimensional space spanned by the corresponding polyhedron . in particular the point dual to the @xmath1-simplex @xmath24 is the centre of a @xmath25-dimensional sphere passing through all vertices of @xmath24 ( look at fig.1 ) .",
    "we can associate uniquely to a dual voronoi edge an element of the poincar group @xmath26 by requiring that ,    @xmath27    in other words we are embedding @xmath28 and @xmath29 in @xmath4 and adopting the standard notion of parallel displacement in @xmath4 .",
    "we move the origin of the reference frames of @xmath29 to @xmath28 . so that the position vectors in @xmath29 of the vertices of the common face @xmath30 will become coincident with the position vectors of the same vertices in @xmath28 .",
    "thus the matrix @xmath31 will be an orthogonal matrix which describes the change from the reference frame of @xmath29 to @xmath28 , considered now as two different reference frames of the same vector space @xcite .",
    "since the simplicial manifold is orientable we can choose the reference frame in @xmath28 and @xmath29 in such a way that @xmath31 is a matrix of so(n ) .",
    "this procedure determines a unique connection that is the a torsion - free _ levi civita or regge connection _ @xcite .",
    "we can assign to each vertex @xmath32 , of the dual voronoi complex , its coordinates @xmath33 in the frame of @xmath28 . since we can choose arbitrarily the reference frames in @xmath28 and @xmath29 , then the theory is invariant under arbitrary poincar trasformations @xmath34 ,    @xmath35    now on we choose , following @xcite , to put the origin of each reference frame in the dual voronoi vertices , then @xmath36 and the poincar group is restricted to the rotation matrices without translations .",
    "then @xmath37 indicates only the rotation matrix . without imposing this sort of gauge fixing ,",
    "it might be possible to study a metric - affine theory of gravity on lattice and this could be the subject of a further research .",
    "see @xcite for more details on metric - affine theory of gravity case as well @xcite and @xcite for the relative consequences in the continuum case .",
    "the hinge @xmath6 is in one - to - one correspondence with its dual two - dimensional voronoi plaquette that we still label by @xmath6 . now consider the following plaquette variable    @xmath38    as it has been shown @xcite @xcite , ( [ ruota ] ) is a rotation in the two - dimensional plane orthogonal to the @xmath5-dimensional hyperplane spanned by the hinge @xmath6 .",
    "the rotation angle is the deficit angle ( [ apex ] ) .",
    "we consider @xmath5 linear independent edge - vectors of the hinge @xmath6 defined in the following way    @xmath39    and the antisymmetric tensor related to the oriented volume of @xmath6    @xmath40    at this point it seems natural to propose the following gravitational action @xcite    @xmath41    let @xmath13 be the oriented volume of the hinge @xmath6 .",
    "the action ( [ haction ] ) is equal @xcite to    @xmath42    which for small deficit angles @xmath7 reduces to the regge action ( [ reggeact ] ) .    the presence in the action of @xmath43 instead of @xmath7 is only a lattice artifact @xcite .",
    "the useful regime of this theory is @xmath44 .",
    "in fact frhlich @xcite has conjectured , as claimed also in @xcite , that this action converges to the einstein - hilbert action , and j.cheeger , w. muller , r.schrader in @xcite have proved that the einstein - regge action ( [ reggeact ] ) converges to the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "they proved that the convergence of the action is in _ sense of measure_. this applies when , roughly speaking , the number of the hinges of the simplicial manifold increases along with the incident number of the simplices at each hinge .",
    "then the triangulations will be finer and finer and the difference , in modulus , between the einstein - hilbert action on a manifold and the regge - einstein one , on the triangulations of the same manifold , become smaller and smaller .",
    "let s consider the @xmath0-dimensional face @xmath45 between the simplices @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the vertex coordinates of @xmath46 are @xmath47 .",
    "the following vector @xcite    @xmath48    is normal to the face @xmath46 , and it is assumed to point outward from the interior of the simplex @xmath28 .",
    "simple considerations of linear algebra show that @xmath49 is an element of the inverse @xmath50 , matrix built using the components of @xmath1 linearly independent edge vectors of the simplex @xmath28 multiplied by the determinant of the direct matrix ( mathematically : the adjoint elements , modulo the determinant , of the matrix of the n - independent vectors ) .",
    "the analogous vector @xmath51 in the reference frame of @xmath29 is related to the previous one by    @xmath52    it can be easily proved that ( [ orio ] ) can be written as a bivector    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the oriented volume of the simplex @xmath28 .",
    "we can consider the action as written on the dual voronoi - complex of the original simplicial complex .",
    "the dual of the hinge @xmath6 is a two dimensional plaquette whose vertices will be @xmath55 .",
    "these vertices are the dual of the @xmath1-simplices incident on the hinge @xmath6 .    if , briefly , we indicate @xmath37 as @xmath56 , and so on , the holonomy matrix ( [ ruota ] ) around the plaquette is    @xmath57    so that the action can be written in term of the bivectors @xmath58 ,    @xmath59    as it has been remarked in @xcite , this sum i ) does not depend on the starting point of each two - dimensional plaquette chosen , and ii ) it is a functional on the two dimensional plaquette of the voronoi complex .",
    "up to now we have dealt with a second order formalism of discrete general relativity .",
    "more precisely the connection matrices @xmath56 and the @xmath60 are both functions of the coordinates of the edges of the simplicial complex .",
    "now we introduce a first order formalism in which @xmath56 and @xmath61 are independent variables .",
    "we set , only , the following constraints    @xmath62    which fix @xmath1 independent conditions for each face , not enogh to determine the @xmath63 degrees of freedom of @xmath56 .    on the @xmath61",
    "there is a further constraint since the @xmath64 normals to the @xmath0-dimensional faces of a @xmath1-simplex @xmath28 are linearly dependent ,    @xmath65    in this first - order formalism of general relativity @xcite @xcite we will consider torsion - free , metric - compatible connection matrices more general than the levi - civita one defined by equation ( [ connec ] ) .",
    "( for a discussion on a possible weaking of the metricity condition see @xcite .",
    "regge calculus with torsion has been studied by i.t .",
    "drummond @xcite ) there is a technical problem we would like pointing out . the gravitational action in the form ( [ daction ] )",
    "could be dependent on the starting simplex .",
    "so we need to define the following antisymmetric tensor on the plaquette @xmath6",
    "@xmath66    the action then is    @xmath67    the action ( [ caction ] ) coincides with the action ( [ daction ] ) in the second - order formalism , and , since ( in matrix notation )    @xmath68    equation ( [ caction ] ) is independent of the starting simplex .",
    "moreover the action ( [ caction ] ) is invariant under the following set of transformations    @xmath69    where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are two elements of @xmath2 .",
    "this can be interpreted as the diffeomorphism invariance of this discrete theory of gravity .",
    "as we remarked before , without gauge - fixing , the affine group would have been the invariance group .",
    "this would have been the starting point to look for a description of gravity , in the connection formalism , as a yang - mills theory of the affine group @xcite in the discrete case .",
    "we highlighted this problem as a , possible , subject for a future investigation .",
    "= 8.0truecm = 8.0truecm",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite@xcite that the @xmath73 is the @xmath1-bein in the reference frame of each simplex .",
    "we are going to stress a feature which will be useful in the next .",
    "it has been noticed in @xcite that the way in which we have defined the coordinates , and , as consequence , the @xmath73 itself , does not take into account the symmetry of each simplex . a better definition consists in introducing affine or `` barycentric '' coordinates .",
    "each point @xmath21 in the interior of a simplex @xmath29 can be considered as a barycenter of @xmath64 masses assigned at the vertices of the simplex ( see reference @xcite and @xcite for more details ) . in particular ,",
    "if we choose in the @xmath1-simplex @xmath29 a reference frame in which the origin coincides with the geometric barycenter @xcite , the coordinates @xmath74 of the vertices , in this reference frame , by the definition of the geometric barycenter , satisfy the condition    @xmath75    which is analogous to ( [ chiusura ] ) . in barycentric",
    "coordinates @xcite we may write the @xmath73 as    @xmath76    the meaning of this formula can be understood , geometrically , in an easy way if we look at fig .",
    "@xmath77 is also normal to a face which belongs to @xmath78 .",
    "so it can be evaluated by solving ( [ chiusura ] ) , considered as an equation in @xmath78 , with respect to @xmath77 .",
    "equation ( [ circob ] ) does not give preference to the coordinates of any vertex .",
    "thus the symmetry of the simplex is preserved as desired .",
    "the relation ( [ circob ] ) can be inverted with respect to @xmath79 and , as in @xcite , we obtain    @xmath80    it could be seen that ( [ coppo ] ) is related to the dual barycentric base as explained in @xcite and @xcite , but we do not explicitly discuss this link , since it is not relevant for the purpose of this article .",
    "as remarked in @xcite , in the second order formalism the action ( [ daction ] ) is equivalent to the regge action for small deficit angles @xmath7 . in our first order formalism we do nt have angles @xmath7 .",
    "the variables related to the deficit angles are the connection matrices @xmath56 . then we assume , by definition , that the _ small deficit angle approximation _ in the first order formalism is the passage from the group variables @xmath56 of so(n ) to the algebraic variables @xmath81 of so(n ) . as a consequence",
    "the connection matrices can be written in the form    @xmath82    in order to avoid the technical complications , which we shall discuss in the next section , we now substitute the constraint @xmath83 into the action for each voronoi edge @xmath84 , which , in the current approximation , is    @xmath85    a straightforward explanation of the action up to the first order shows that    @xmath86    where @xmath87 is the @xmath88 antisymmetric tensor ( [ media ] ) at zeroth order , in the @xmath89-expansion .",
    "here we have used the approximation ( [ approx ] ) . for each voronoi - edge",
    "we have solved the constraint ( [ duplex ] ) up to the first order ( [ first ] ) .",
    "we also impose the requirement that the action is stationary under variation with respect to @xmath81 ,    @xmath90    these are the @xmath91 implicit equations for @xmath81 , which has @xmath91 independent components .",

    "we do not know anything about the uniqueness of this solution globally .",
    "we are , in some sense , in a situation analogous to that described in @xcite .",
    "barrett found , locally , the uniqueness of the solution , but has showed that this result is not valid globally . locally the unique solution can be found by using the @xmath94 connection .",
    "we determine the matrix connection by equations ( [ connec ] ) , in which the translation vector is a known quantity , once we put the origins of the refernce frames in the barycenter of the simplices .",
    "the equations ( [ connec ] ) determine the connection matrices as functions of the coordinates of the vertices . in barycentric coordinates these are in one - to - one relation with the @xmath93 .",
    "then we determine the connection matrices as functions of the @xmath93 .",
    "the identity    @xmath95    can be easily proved if we express @xmath96 as in ( [ arrota ] ) , and use the constraint @xmath97 .",
    "the statement that this is the levi civita - regge connection implies    @xmath98    so that to the zero order    @xmath99    these facts imply that    @xmath100    that is to say the levi civita - regge connection is the solution of our first - order equations for the connection matrices in the limit of small deficit angles .",
    "in the previous section we have seen that , in the case of small deficit angles , regge calculus is the solution of the first order field equations .",
    "now we are going to deal with the general problem .",
    "we would like to derive the equation of motion by varying the action with respect to @xmath56 and @xmath60 .",
    "first we have to take in account the constraints ( [ duplex ] ) and ( [ chiusura ] ) .",
    "so , in order to perform independent variations of @xmath56 and @xmath60 , it is necessary to put lagrange multipliers in the action .",
    "then the action , in the palatini first order , is    @xmath101    where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are @xmath1-dimensional vectors and lagrange multipliers respectively , and @xmath104 is an @xmath105 matrix .",
    "the constraint @xmath106 is introduced to restrict the variation of @xmath56 on the group @xmath2 .",
    "we introduce the following lemma :    * lemma * :    _ the action , in matrix notation , _",
    "@xmath107    gives the equation of motion , ( if we assume that the variation with respect to @xmath108 is stationary    )    @xmath109    * proof * : if we consider the variation of the action , using the property that @xmath110 and the action is stationary respect to @xmath108 and @xmath111 we have    @xmath112    multiplying the first equation for @xmath108 on the left , and the second for @xmath111 on the right , and subtracting term by term these two equations , we have ( [ reslem ] ) .    applying the lemma to the action ( [ 1action ] ) for the variation with respect to @xmath56",
    ", we obtain the field equations    @xmath113    the next step will be to determine the field equations for the variations of @xmath60 . for this",
    "it is necessary to determine the quantity @xmath114 .",
    "as remarked in @xcite , we have the following identity    @xmath115    we can write this formula in a way which is not dependent on the chosen index @xmath116.equivalently equation ( [ vol ] ) can be written as    @xmath117    so that it is clearly independent of any index . thus , we have    @xmath118    evaluating its derivative with respect to @xmath119 we obtain    @xmath120    now we are ready to derive the field equations for the variations of the @xmath60 .",
    "so let s consider the action ( [ 1action ] ) .",
    "it is straightforward to write it as    @xmath121    let s define    @xmath122    the variation with respect to @xmath123 is    @xmath124    the field equations ( [ moto ] ) and ( [ variola ] ) are the analogues of the first order einstein equations in the @xmath1-bein formalism ( see @xcite for a strict analogy ) .",
    "the connection matrices , @xmath56 , the @xmath1-bein , @xmath123 , and the lagrange multipliers @xmath125 and @xmath126 must be determined by solving the equations ( [ moto ] ) and ( [ variola ] ) and the constraints ( [ duplex ] ) , ( [ chiusura ] ) as well the orthogonal condition of the connection matrices .",
    "a nice feature of these equations is that if @xmath127 is solution of the equations of motion , the map    @xmath128    will provide an other solution , as it is easily to verify , of the discrete einstein equations . this map ,",
    "if we restrict to the b s only , shows that the discrete einstein equations have a conformal symmetry , anyway in the _ solutions _ not in the _",
    "action_. this is the same feature of the regge equations @xcite .",
    "in this section we shall discuss the quantum measure to associate with the previous classical action .",
    "the action @xcite is invariant under the action of the group @xmath2 , that is the gauge group ( [ gauge ] ) .",
    "we will use the following notation :    @xmath129    and let    @xmath130    be the haar measure on @xmath2 . the partition function for this theory",
    "is :    @xmath131    here the product @xmath132 is a product over all vertices of the dual complex as well the product @xmath133 over all the voronoi links which has @xmath28 as one of his vertices .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the measure is invariant under the gauge transformation ( [ gauge ] ) .",
    "in fact if we perform the gauge transformation ( [ gauge ] ) , the modifications to the measure are :    @xmath134    but @xmath135 is equal to @xmath136 , and reduces to @xmath137 as well .",
    "the haar measure of @xmath2 is right and left invariant .",
    "so @xmath138 .",
    "again , by using equations ( [ gauge ] ) the two deltas of ( [ modifico ] ) can be written in the following form :    @xmath139    then the properties of the delta function along with the last considerations prove that equation ( [ modifico ] ) can be written as    @xmath140    this establishes the invariance of the measure under gauge trasformations",
    ".    challenged by @xcite we can argue that the metric structure we are considering is not as peculiar as the metric written as a function of the edge - lengths in regge calculus . in first - order formalism",
    "we neither have transition functions which depend on the metric structure , the @xmath1-bein in our case , nor do we sum over a metric that is gauge - fixed . from the form of the constraint equations , those in the argument of the delta functions , and from the calculations we have performed , we expect that this measure , once we have integrated over the deltas , is really highly not local as has been discovered for regge calculus .",
    "in the continuum theory on riemannian manifolds with torsion - free connection the coupling with fermionic matter ( for the same case in presence of torsion see @xcite ) is given by the lagrangian density    @xmath141    the @xmath142 are the dirac - matrices satisfying the clifford algebra    @xmath143    whereas @xmath144 is the n - dimensional dirac spinor field ( @xmath145),@xmath146 the covariant derivative , and @xmath147 the n - beins on the tangent space of the riemannian manifold @xmath148 , where the lagrangian density is defined ( [ lagra ] ) , such that    @xmath149    we are assuming that the riemannian manifold @xmath148 in question has a spin structure , that is its second stiefel - whitney class is zero .",
    "now we have all the ingredients to define the coupling of gravity with fermionic matter on the lattice in analogy with the continuum case .",
    "let @xmath150 or @xmath151 ( depending on whether @xmath1 is even or odd ) and consider the @xmath152-dimensional representation of the two - fold covering group of @xmath2@xcite .",
    "so , instead of considering the connection matrices @xmath56 , we will deal with the @xmath153 connection matrices @xmath154 such that    @xmath155    given @xmath154 we can determine @xmath56 .",
    "furthermore if we know @xmath56 , we can determine @xmath154 up to a sign .",
    "in particular , from ( [ 2-fold ] ) , we can write @xmath56 as @xcite    @xmath156    in the discrete theory we assume that the spinor field is a @xmath152 complex vector defined at each vertex of the dual voronoi complex , that is to say a map that to each vertex @xmath28 associates the @xmath152 complex vector @xmath157 .    in order to define the covariant derivative on a lattice we have to derive the distance @xmath158 between the two neighboring circumcenters in @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "our reasoning concerning the baricenters can be extended to the circumcenters too .",
    "the distance @xmath159 of the circumcenter in @xmath28 from the face @xmath160 can be determined by calculating the volume of the @xmath1-dimensional simplex obtained by joining the circumcenter with the @xmath1-vertices of the face @xmath160 , and dividing it by @xmath1 and by the volume of the face itself .",
    "so we have    @xmath161    in which the @xmath79 are the circumcentric coordinates of the vertices of the face @xmath160 and @xmath162 the module of the @xmath61 written as function of the @xmath79 , as in ( [ circob ] ) .    in the same manner",
    "we have    @xmath163    finally , we have @xmath164 .",
    "we are ready to define the covariant derivative @xmath165 on a lattice    @xmath166    so far the discrete version of the the action for the coupling between gravity and fermionic matter can be written in the form ( see also @xcite )    @xmath167    then the quantum measure , which also includes fermionic matter , can be written as    @xmath168    where @xmath24 is the action for pure gravity ( [ caction ] ) , @xmath169 the haar measure on the two - fold covering group of @xmath2 , while @xmath170 is the standard measure on @xmath171 .",
    "in this paper we have studied a discrete theory of gravity in its first - order formalism . following an earlier previous paper @xcite ,",
    "we have chosen an orthonormal reference frame in each simplex and have defined a connection matrix as a transformation matrix between the reference frames of two @xmath1-dimensional simplices that share a common @xmath0-face , considered as two distinct reference frames at the same point .",
    "this defines a levi civita - regge connection .",
    "these matrices allow us to write an holonomy matrix around each hinge @xmath6 .",
    "we define the action as the sum over the hinges of the traces of the holonomy matrices multiplied by the oriented volumes of the hinges .",
    "this action can be written on the dual voronoi complex of the original simplicial complex .",
    "we can express the action as a function of the connection matrices and of the vectors @xmath60 which are normal to the faces of the simplices and whose modulo is proportional to the volume of the faces themself .",
    "the action is very similar to the wilson action of lattice gauge theory . here",
    "the @xmath60 have the same role as the @xmath1-bein in the continuum theory .",
    "moreover the action is locally invariant under the action of the poincar group .    on the dual",
    "voronoi metric complex the first - order formalism is implemented by considering the dynamical variables @xmath56 and @xmath60 independent .",
    "it is shown that in the limit of small deficit angles the _ levi - civita or regge connection _ is a solution of the equations of motion .",
    "as in barrett @xcite , the solution is unique locally , by dini s theorem .",
    "however we do not know what is going to happen globally .",
    "the general equations for @xmath56 and @xmath60 are derived by using lagrange multipliers , in order to take in account the constraints of the first order formalism .    a quantum measure and the relative partition function has been defined .",
    "they are locally invariant under the action of @xmath2 .",
    "we have introduced a coupling of gravity with fermionic matter on the voronoi complex as well .",
    "this coupling seems as natural as for the continuum theory . in particular",
    "it seems the voronoi complex allows us to introduce the coupling with matter , avoiding all the troubles we had in regge calculus .",
    "we hope that this first - order formalism might be useful for numerical simulations . in particular its first - order character , numerically ,",
    "could have more advantages than the usual ( regge ) second order formulation in implementing the evolution of equations of motion .",
