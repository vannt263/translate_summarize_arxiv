    "one of the major uncertainties in making reliable predictions in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is to understand the theory at low momentum scales where the coupling becomes large and non - perturbative effects become important . in fact , it is well known that perturbation theory itself is not well defined in the infrared domain , since the perturbative series is asymptotic . for infrared - safe quantities",
    "the non - perturbative effects can be parameterized as power corrections of the form @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the qcd - scale and @xmath9 is the hard scale of the process considered .",
    "the coefficients @xmath10 can not be calculated in general , but in some cases such as the event - shapes in @xmath11 annihilation , one can determine the dominating power @xmath12 and also find relations between the @xmath10 for different observables by using the operator product expansion  @xcite or renormalon calculus ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the behavior of fixed - order perturbation theory at low momentum scales is governed by the running coupling @xmath13 .",
    "the conventional coupling @xmath14 , defined using the modified minimal subtraction renormalization scheme and dimensional regularization , is analytically singular at a scale @xmath15 .",
    "this nonphysical behavior leads to a number of difficulties , including renormalon @xmath16 growth of the coefficients when one makes perturbative expansions of physical observables in the @xmath17 scheme .",
    "these problems can be traced to the fact that integrals over the running coupling which appear in bubble graphs are ill - defined due to the non - analyticity of the @xmath18 coupling",
    ".    there also exists the possibility to define a running coupling which stays finite in the infrared .",
    "one such example is the  time - like \" effective coupling which is used in the dispersive approach  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "an observable is written as an integral over a process dependent characteristic function times a universal  time - like \" effective coupling .",
    "the idea is that such a coupling may give an effective measure of the interaction at low scales  @xcite .",
    "power corrections can then be written as process dependent moments over the effective coupling .",
    "an alternative procedure is to define the fundamental coupling of qcd from a given physical observable  @xcite .",
    "these couplings , called effective charges , are all - order resummations of perturbation theory and include all non - perturbative effects . since these physical charges correspond to the complete theory of qcd , it is guaranteed that they are analytic and non - singular .",
    "for example , it has been shown that unlike the @xmath18 coupling , a physical coupling is analytic across quark flavor thresholds  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we expect that a physical coupling should stay finite in the infrared when the momentum scale goes to zero . in turn",
    ", this means that integrals over the running coupling are well defined for physical couplings .",
    "an additional question is whether the physical couplings freeze to a constant value in the infrared .",
    "once such a physical coupling @xmath19 is chosen , other physical quantities can be expressed as expansions in @xmath20 by eliminating the @xmath18 coupling which now becomes only an intermediary  @xcite .",
    "in such a procedure there are in principle no further renormalization scale ( @xmath21 ) or scheme ambiguities .",
    "the physical couplings satisfy the standard renormalization group equation for its logarithmic derivative , @xmath22 $ ] , where the first two terms in the perturbative expansion of the gell - mann low function @xmath23 are scheme - independent at leading twist whereas the higher order terms have to be calculated for each observable separately using perturbation theory",
    ".    quantum field theoretic predictions which relate physical observables can not depend on theoretical conventions such as the choice of renormalization scheme or scale ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the most well - known example is the perturbative  generalized crewther relation \"  @xcite in which the leading twist qcd corrections to the bjorken sum rule for polarized deep inelastic scattering at a given lepton momentum transfer @xmath24 are related through a geometric series to the qcd corrections to @xmath25 at a corresponding cm energy squared , @xmath26 , independent of renormalization scheme , @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the scales @xmath28 has been computed to nlo in pqcd .",
    "such leading - twist predictions between observables are called  commensurate scale relations \" and are identical for conformal and nonconformal theories  @xcite . in addition , the conformal coefficients are free of the renormalon factorial growth  @xcite    for example , in qed , the gell - mann low running coupling @xmath29 , which is formally defined from the renormalization of the dressed photon propagator , is a physical coupling since it could be determined from a measurement of the part of the potential @xmath30 between two infinitely heavy test charges which is linear in their charges ; i.e. , @xmath31 . using the skeleton expansion  @xcite ,",
    "the coefficients in perturbative expansions of other physical quantities are identical to that in a theory which is conformal , since all effects of the non - zero @xmath32 function are already summed into the integrals over the running coupling . by the mean value theorem ,",
    "the same is also true for the standard perturbative expansion if the scale , at which to evaluate the coupling , is properly chosen  @xcite .",
    "it is not as simple to identify a suitable physical coupling to be used in the case of qcd . for a skeleton expansion to be possible ,",
    "the abelian part of the coupling should coincide with the gell - mann low coupling , since qcd becomes an abelian theory in the analytic limit @xmath33 at fixed @xmath34 and fixed @xmath35  @xcite . a possible candidate for a physical coupling in qcd which fulfills",
    "this requirement is the @xmath36 scheme defined from the potential between two heavy test color charges  @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to the abelian case , this definition is problematic since the  @xmath37graphs \" which arise from gluon exchange diagrams with a horizontal gluon rung connecting the  first \" and  last \" exchanged gluons have an infrared sensitivity which depends on the details of the test charge wavefunction  @xcite .",
    "another possible generalization of the gell - man low coupling to non - abelian theories is the  pinch \" scheme  @xcite which rearranges the contributions to scattering amplitudes to insure a structure @xmath38 similar to that of qed . as in qed ,",
    "expansions in the pinch scheme have the same structure as those of a conformal theory .",
    "the pinch charge is a promising physical scheme , but at this time the complexity of higher order calculations in this scheme and its indirect connection to measurements has prevented its practical implementation , although recently there has been attempts to make an all - orders definition of a qcd effective charge  @xcite .    in this note",
    "we will discuss an alternative definition of a physical coupling for qcd which has a direct relation to high precision measurements of the hadronic decay channels of the @xmath39 .",

    "we will concentrate on non - strange decay modes and thus @xmath45 where @xmath46 is an electroweak correction term  @xcite and @xmath47  @xcite is the relevant ckm matrix element .",
    "the data for @xmath0 decays is well - understood channel by channel , thus allowing a precise separation of vector and axial - vector decay modes which can therefore be studied separately .",
    "the measured invariant mass spectrum for the non - strange hadronic decay modes can also be used to study hypothetical @xmath0-leptons with a smaller mass , @xmath48  @xcite . in this way the @xmath0-decay data allows us to study the behavior of the coupling @xmath49 in the region @xmath50 and address the question whether this physical coupling freezes in the infrared .",
    "the experimental data on the non - strange hadronic @xmath0-decays can be used to define the hadronic decay rate normalized to the leptonic one for a hypothetical @xmath0-lepton with mass in the range @xmath2 in the following way  @xcite : @xmath51,\\ ] ] where @xmath52 are the spectral functions for the measured non - strange hadronic final states with angular momentum @xmath53 . the scalar contribution @xmath54",
    "is assumed to vanish for the vector current and is given by the single pion pole for the axial current .",
    "the above definition coincides with the standard definition in the case @xmath55 .",
    "note , however , that the right - hand side above uses @xmath56 instead of @xmath57 not only in the upper integration limit but also in the kinematic prefactors . this way the end - point is suppressed in the same way for the hypothetical @xmath0-lepton as for the real one  @xcite .",
    "the ratio @xmath58 is thus defined as if a hypothetical lepton of mass @xmath56 existed .",
    "since states with non - zero strangeness can be excluded , all of the hadrons in the final state can be assumed to arise from @xmath59 .",
    "we can then define effective charges @xmath60 for the vector and axial - vector decay modes as follows : @xmath61 .",

    "it is thus natural to identify the complimentary @xmath63 combination which has canonical perturbative qcd contributions as the preferred qcd effective charge , @xmath64 , defined by @xmath65 .",
    "\\label{rtaupqcd}\\ ] ]    for completeness , we also recall how one can use experimental data to measure the decay ratio of hypothetical @xmath0-leptons for masses well above @xmath66",
    "just as in the case of @xmath0-leptons one can define a local unintegrated effective charge @xmath67 directly from the annihilation data : @xmath68 , \\label{alphar}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the zeroth order qcd prediction .",
    "if we assume isospin invariance , then the decay ratio of a hypothetical @xmath0-lepton in the vector channel @xmath70 can be written as a spectral integral with weight @xmath71 , where @xmath72 , of the annihilation cross section @xmath73 in the isospin @xmath74 channel .",
    "this allows the measurement of @xmath75 well above the physical mass of the @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "we thus can relate the @xmath76 and @xmath77 effective charges : @xmath78 the mean value theorem then implies @xmath79 a form of commensurate scale relation . in the case of three flavors ( @xmath80 )",
    "the above relation is still valid to next - to - next - to - leading order even if one does not restrict oneself to the @xmath81 channel . to next - to - leading order in @xmath82",
    "the scale @xmath83 is given by ( see for example  @xcite ) @xmath84.\\ ] ] before continuing we also note that as an alternative definition of a hypothetical @xmath0-lepton with mass above @xmath66 one could use @xmath85 measured from @xmath0-decays for the integration region @xmath86 and data from @xmath87 in the @xmath81 channel for the remaining integration region @xmath88 .    the empirical behavior of the decay ratios @xmath41 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath62 using data on @xmath0-decays as determined by the opal collaboration at lep  @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rtau ] .",
    "there are several striking features :    1 .",
    "the @xmath62 combination tends to vanish at high scales , showing that only higher dimensional operators contribute .",
    "this is a highly non - trivial test of qcd .",
    "@xcite 2 .",
    "the @xmath41 contribution has only a slow variation in the low mass range .",
    "the corresponding effective charges @xmath3 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 as well as the difference @xmath93 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alphaeff ] .    based on the analysis by the opal collaboration  @xcite",
    ", the experimental value of the coupling @xmath94 at @xmath95 corresponds to a value of @xmath96-@xmath97 , where the range corresponds to three different perturbative methods used in analyzing the data .",
    "this result is , at least for the fixed order and renormalon resummation methods , in good agreement with the world average @xmath98  @xcite .",
    "however , from the figure we also see that the effective charge only reaches @xmath99 at @xmath100 , and it even stays within the same range down to @xmath101 .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the estimate of mattingly and stevenson  @xcite for the effective coupling @xmath102 for @xmath103 determined from @xmath104 annihilation , especially if one takes into account the perturbative commensurate scale relation , @xmath105 where , for @xmath106 , we have @xmath107 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : csrnlo ] ) . as we will show in more detail in the next section ,",
    "this behavior is not consistent with the coupling having a landau pole but rather shows that the physical coupling is much more constant at low scales , suggesting that physical qcd couplings are effectively constant or ",
    "frozen \" at low scales .    at the same time",
    ", it should be recognized that the behavior of @xmath49 in the region @xmath108 is more and more influenced by non - perturbative effects as the scale is lowered . even though the dominant non - perturbative effects cancel in the sum of the vector and axial - vector contributions as can be seen by looking at the corresponding effective charges individually .",
    "looking at @xmath109 , we see that it more or less vanishes as the integration region moves to the left of the two - pion peak in the hadronic spectrum . in the same way the behavior of @xmath110 at small scales is governed by the single pion pole .",
    "in order to be able to analyze the infrared behavior of the effective coupling @xmath49 in more detail , we will compare with ( a ) the fixed - order perturbative evolution of the @xmath49 coupling on the one hand , and ( b ) with the evolution of couplings that have non - perturbative or all - order resummations included in their definition .",
    "for the latter case , many different schemes have been suggested , and we will concentrate on two of them : the one - loop  time - like \" effective coupling @xmath111  @xcite , and the modified @xmath112 coupling calculated from the static quark potential using perturbative gluon condensate dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the perturbative couplings evolve according to the standard evolution equation @xmath113 where @xmath114 .",
    "the first two terms in the @xmath115-function , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , are universal at leading twist whereas the higher order terms are scheme dependent .",
    "currently the @xmath115-function is known to four loops ( @xmath118 ) in the @xmath18 scheme and to three loops ( @xmath119 ) in the @xmath3 scheme . in the latter case there",
    "also exists an estimate of the four - loop term . for completeness these terms",
    "are summarized in the appendix .",
    "[ fig : fopt_comp ] shows a comparison of the experimentally determined effective charge @xmath49 with solutions to the evolution equation ( [ eq : foptevol ] ) for @xmath3 at two- , three- , and four - loop order normalized at @xmath66 .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the data on @xmath49 does not have the same behavior as the solution of the ( universal ) two - loop equation which is singular scheme where both @xmath119 and @xmath118 are positive for @xmath80 .",
    "] at the scale @xmath120 . however , at three loops the behavior of the perturbative solution drastically changes , and instead of diverging , it freezes to a value @xmath121 in the infrared .",
    "the reason for this fundamental change is , of course , the negative sign of @xmath122 . at the same time , it must be kept in mind that this result is not perturbatively stable since the evolution of the coupling is governed by the highest order term .",
    "this is illustrated by the widely different results obtained for three different values of the unknown four loop term @xmath123 which are also shown used are obtained from the estimate of the four loop term in the perturbative series of @xmath124 , @xmath125  @xcite . ] .",
    "still , it may be more than a mere coincidence that the three - loop solution freezes in the infrared .",
    "recently it has been argued that @xmath67 freezes perturbatively to all orders  @xcite .",
    "given the commensurate scale relation  ( [ mvt ] ) this should also be true perturbatively for @xmath49 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the central four - loop solution is in good agreement with the data all the way down to @xmath120 .",

    "the resulting effective coupling is finite in the infrared and freezes to the value @xmath131 as @xmath132 .",
    "it is also instructive to expand the  time - like \" effective coupling for large @xmath133 , @xmath134 this shows that the  time - like \" effective coupling is a resummation of @xmath135-corrections to the  space - like \" coupling which occurs in the analytic continuation .",

    "the form for the finite coupling @xmath136 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : alphaeff ] ) obeys standard pqcd evolution at lo .",
    "thus one can have a solution for the perturbative running of the qcd coupling which obeys asymptotic freedom but does not have a landau singularity .",
    "the evolution of the modified @xmath137 coupling is to leading order governed by the evolution equation , @xmath138 where @xmath139 the difference compared to the ordinary evolution equation is thus that the gluonic contribution to @xmath116 freezes out at a scale @xmath140  the scale of the gluon condensate .",

    "the solutions have been normalized to the data at @xmath66 .",
    "in addition , when solving the evolution equation for @xmath112 ( [ eq : modvevol ] ) we have used the value @xmath142 which makes the solution to the one - loop evolution equation ( [ eq : foptevol ] ) agree with the data at @xmath66 if one sets @xmath143 . as can be seen from the figure , the data on @xmath49 agrees well qualitatively with both of these simple examples of freezing couplings down to the scale @xmath120 . below this scale",
    "the non - perturbative effects in @xmath49 associated with the single pion pole in the axial vector current and the double pion peak in the vector current starts to dominate and makes a direct comparison with models which do not contain the spectrum of hadrons less meaningful .",
    "the results of this paper show the advantages of defining the qcd coupling directly from a physical observable .",
    "the resulting effective coupling can be defined even at low scales , it is finite and analytic , and it has no scheme or renormalization scale ambiguities . as we have shown , the hadronic decays of the @xmath0 lepton can be used to determine the effective charge @xmath1 for a hypothetical @xmath0-lepton with mass in the range @xmath2 .",
    "the high precision of @xmath0 hadronic decay data thus provides a precise standard definition for the fundamental qcd coupling .",
    "qcd predictions for other observables can then be expressed as functions of this coupling @xmath144 , thus relating observable to observable .",
    "an important feature of @xmath144 is its apparent near constant behavior at low mass scales .",
    "the empirical results using the opal data are consistent with the freezing of the physical coupling at mass scales @xmath4 of order @xmath5 with a magnitude @xmath145 .",
    "these results contrast dramatically with standard expectations of a divergent coupling based on the universal two - loop coupling which becomes infinite at small mass scales . at higher orders of perturbation theory for the beta function ,",
    "the behavior of the coupling is scheme dependent and in addition it is dominated by the highest order term . in the physical @xmath44-scheme",
    "the behavior of the coupling in the infrared is not so clear . at 3-loops",
    "the @xmath144 coupling has an infrared fixed point whereas at higher orders the behavior of the coupling is not known .",
    "estimates of the 4-loop term indicate both an infrared fixed point as well as a divergent behavior .",
    "recently it has been argued by howe and maxwell  @xcite that the effective charge @xmath67 has an infrared fixed point to all orders in perturbation theory . given the commensurate scale relation between @xmath44 and @xmath82 this should then also be true for @xmath144 .",
    "a simple example of the mechanism behind such a perturbative infrared fixed point is given by the effective  time - like \" one - loop coupling @xmath141 which agrees well qualitatively with the empirically determined coupling .",
    "another mechanism which also gives an infrared fixed point in qualitative agreement with the data is given by the perturbative gluon condensate dynamics .",
    "these simple examples show that indeed the empirical behavior @xmath144 is consistent with an infrared fixed point .",
    "as we have discussed in the introduction , effective charges defined from different observables are related in perturbative qcd to each other at leading twist through commensurate scale relations  @xcite .",
    "the perturbative coefficients which appear in these relations are identical to those in conformal qcd ; i.e. the theory defined with a zero @xmath115 function . the effects of the nonzero @xmath115 function of physical qcd are absorbed into the scale of the effective couplings .",
    "examples are the relations between @xmath82 and @xmath44 and the generalized crewther relation , which relates the effective charge defined from the bjorken sum rule for @xmath146 to the adler coupling defined from @xmath147 annihilation through a geometric series  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath148 has effectively constant behavior at small mass scales , the commensurate scale relations between @xmath44 and other physical couplings imply that at leading twist all effective charges have a similar fixed - point behavior in the infrared regime .",
    "in particular , our results are consistent with the infrared freezing of @xmath82 at low @xmath133 obtained by mattingly and stevenson  @xcite .",
    "the commensurate scale relations  @xcite can of course also be used at larger scales in order to compare experimental results from different observables .",
    "for example , the @xmath44 effective charge can be evolved to the commensurate scale of another observable which one wants to compare with . this way",
    "the results can be compared directly , free of theoretical conventions , instead of by first extracting @xmath149 and then comparing . beyond leading twist",
    "one can also include power - corrections in the commensurate scale relations and determine non - perturbative parameters in a standard way .",
    "ultimately one could also envision to use a physical effective charge in the dispersive approach .",
    "as we have shown , the four - loop evolution of @xmath44 with @xmath150 gives a good description of the data down to @xmath151 and could thus be used as an effective model for the @xmath44 coupling in the low - energy regime .",
    "the near constancy of the effective qcd coupling at small scales helps explain the empirical success of dimensional counting rules for the power law fall - off of form factors and fixed angle scaling ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can calculate the hard scattering amplitude @xmath152 for such processes  @xcite without scale ambiguity in terms of the effective charge @xmath44 or @xmath82 using commensurate scale relations .",
    "the effective coupling is evaluated in the regime where the coupling is approximately constant , in contrast to the rapidly varying behavior from powers of @xmath153 predicted by perturbation theory ( the universal two - loop coupling ) .",
    "for example , the nucleon form factors are proportional at leading order to two powers of @xmath153 evaluated at low scales in addition to two powers of @xmath154 ; the pion photoproduction amplitude at fixed angles is proportional at leading order to three powers of the qcd coupling .",
    "the essential variation from leading - twist counting - rule behavior then only arises from the anomalous dimensions of the hadron distribution amplitudes .",
    "the large magnitude that we find @xmath6 also implies a substantially larger normalization for the pion form factor and other exclusive observables than estimates based on a canonical value @xmath155 .",
    "the corresponding larger value of @xmath156 associated with the exchange of @xmath12 gluons in the hard scattering amplitude could eliminate much of the discrepancy between data and previous estimates of the pqcd predictions for the normalization of exclusive hard scattering amplitudes .",
    "the perturbative expansion of the @xmath115 function is given by , @xmath157 where @xmath114 . the first two terms in the @xmath115-function  @xcite , @xmath158 are universal at leading twist whereas the higher order terms are scheme dependent . in the @xmath18 scheme the first two scheme dependent coefficients are known  @xcite : @xmath159 in case of the @xmath3 scheme , @xmath122 is known exactly whereas for @xmath123 there are only estimates .",
