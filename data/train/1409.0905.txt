    "since the discovery of the x - ray background ( xrb ) in 1963 , numerous evolving efforts have been made to resolve its sources .",
    "the rosat satellite was able to resolve most of the soft x - ray background into unobscured quasars .",
    "however , the overall spectral energy distribution of the background as a whole was not well approximated until the deep imaging capability of _ chandra _ resolved the hard xrb into point sources : quasars and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) @xcite . @xcite resolved 60%-80% of the hard xrb in the _ chandra _ deep field south , and found that the x - ray and optical properties of the sources were consistent with agn being the dominant population .",
    "optically selected agn have spectra characterized by strong emission lines with flux ratios that imply a powerful ionizing source , assumed to be the accretion disk around the central supermassive black hole .",
    "surprisingly , though , more than half of the x - ray sources exist in apparently normal galaxies , with no optical indication of nuclear activity",
    ". numerous examples of such objects have been reported in optical follow - ups of x - ray surveys @xcite . in the aforementioned _ chandra _",
    "study , @xcite conclude that several of their hard xrb sources are likely to be obscured agn , due to their red colors , and point out one object in particular that appears to be a normal elliptical galaxy .",
    "in fact , 40% - 60% of all x - ray selected agn lack optical signatures of nuclear accretion @xcite .",
    "there are two main classes of such objects : optically - elusive agn , which have emission lines but are classified as hii regions or star forming galaxies instead of agn by traditional line ratio diagnostics , and x - ray bright optically normal galaxies ( xbongs ) , which have no optical indication of nuclear activity at all , and whose optical spectra resemble quiescent normal galaxies .",
    "much effort has been devoted to studying these anomalous objects .",
    "interpretations are broad and contradictory .",
    "one of the earlier objects discovered by @xcite was further analyzed by @xcite and found to be a compton - thick , fully obscured agn with nuclear x - ray emission that has been scattered and reprocessed .",
    "however , @xcite find that none of the elusive agn in the xmm - newton bright serendipitous survey ( xbs ) are compton - thick .",
    "another possibility is the dilution of the spectrum due to high inclusion of starlight in the slit during observation .",
    "indeed , @xcite invokes this explanation for the majority of low - luminosity optically elusive agn in their sample . for the high luminosity sources , the authors blame compton - thin absorption for the lack of optical lines .",
    "@xcite investigate this possibility by integrating the host galaxy light of several nearby known seyfert 2 galaxies and adding it to the observed agn spectrum .",
    "the authors find that , while some evidence of optical lines still exists in the integrated spectra , the objects would not have been selected as agn in normal signal - to - noise spectra .",
    "this demonstrated that starlight dilution can cause optical normalcy in agn .",
    "however , @xcite find in the hellas2xmm survey that while xbongs are similar to traditional narrow - line agn in terms of x - ray luminosity , optical luminosity , and absorbing column densities , they have systematically lower @xmath0 emission .",
    "such a finding argues against xbongs simply being normal agn occupying the low end of the @xmath1 distribution .",
    "more exotic explanations include radiatively - inefficient accretion flows ( riafs ) , examined by @xcite and found to be consistent with the spectra of two xbongs , massive absorption by widespread dust in the host galaxy @xcite , and bl lac objects with unusually low radio luminosity @xcite .",
    "the first two of these will be examined in depth later in this paper .",
    "the third explanation is unlikely , due to the low space - density of bl lac objects and the relatively high space - density of xbongs .",
    "if dust obscuration is a key player in the optical normalcy of these objects , examining them in the infrared is perhaps the most promising way to find the hidden nuclear emission , since extinction in the k - band is less significant than in the optical . here , we present near - infrared ( nir ) spectra of four xbongs and four optically elusive agn at low redshifts , to determine whether they can be successfully detected as agn in the nir waveband . in section  [ sec :",
    "selection ] , we explain how we chose our eight objects . section  [ sec : reduction ] discusses our observations and data reduction process . in section  [ sec : agnsig ] we discuss methods of infrared agn selection and whether or not each method is successful for objects in our sample .",
    "section  [ sec : dust ] discusses dust obscuration , the most obvious explanation for optical normalcy that warrants investigation , and whether or not this is a likely explanation for our objects .",
    "section  [ contfits ] describes the results of our nir continuum fitting .",
    "section  [ sec : alt ] examines alternative explanations for optical normalcy , including starlight dilution , nuclear star formation , and radiatively inefficient accretion flows .",
    "we conclude , in an appendix , with a summary of our results for each of our eight objects and which scenario we believe to be most plausible in each case .",
    "the burst alert telescope ( bat ) hard x - ray detector is a component of the _ swift _ gamma - ray burst observatory .",
    "it is sensitive to the ultra - hard x - ray band , from 14 - 195 kev , and detects x - ray sources down to a level of 4.8@xmath2 .",
    "swift_-bat survey is an all - sky survey of the ultra hard x - ray band @xcite .",
    "the flux limit of the survey is @xmath3 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 over 50% of the sky , and @xmath6 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 over 90% of the sky .",
    "to identify possible xbongs or optically elusive agn , we used _",
    "swift_-bat agn from the 58 month catalog that are nearby ( @xmath7 ) with available sdss or 6df spectroscopy in the northern hemisphere ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "this included 94 spectra . of these we found eight cases with optical emission features consistent with xbongs or optically elusive agn .",
    "the galaxies and their classifications are listed in table  [ t : tab1 ] .",
    "we observed our eight objects using the short wavelength cross - dispersed mode ( sxd ) of the spex instrument at the nasa infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) .",
    "the instrument used in this mode covers a wavelength band of 0.8 - 2.4 microns and is described in detail in @xcite . for all observations ,",
    "a @xmath9 slit was used .",
    "the galaxies were observed using a nodding abba source pattern .",
    "the irtf has a chopping secondary mirror for rapid sky sampling , producing ab pairs in the data .",
    "standard a0 v stars with similar airmasses were observed after each galaxy , to provide a benchmark for telluric correction .",
    "the spectra were extracted using spextool , a software package developed especially for irtf spex observations @xcite .",
    "each ab pair was extracted separately , then combined using a robust weighted mean to produce an average image and scaled using the order with the best signal - to - noise .",
    "the combined spectra were tellurically corrected using the method described by @xcite and embodied in the idl routine xtellcor , using a vega model modified by deconvolution .",
    "the orders were then merged into a single spectrum , and the routine xcleanspec was used to remove regions of the spectrum that were completely absorbed by the atmosphere .",
    "the spectra were then smoothed using a savitzky - golay routine , which preserves the average resolving power .",
    "six of our objects are spectroscopic targets in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite .",
    "one object , ngc 4686 , has sdss photometry but no spectrum . for this object ,",
    "we have obtained an optical spectrum from kitt peak observatory .",
    "the object 2mfgc 00829 is not included in sdss at all , and is instead in the 6df survey of the southern sky @xcite . to supplement the 6df spectrum , we have obtained a higher s / n optical spectrum with the snifs instrument on the university of hawaii 88 inch telescope .",
    "we also make use of the public data from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) and wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) , as well as drawing data from the literature on the _",
    "swift_-bat survey and published data from the _ spitzer _ mid - to - far infrared telescope .    the combined optical and infrared spectra are shown in figure [ fig : spectra ] , where the optical spectra were obtained from the various sources described above .",
    "since the x - ray is an expensive and technically challenging band in which to observe , it is desirable to find unambiguous signatures of agn activity in the substantially cheaper nir band , which can be easily observed from the ground .",
    "additionally , the extinction in the k - band is reduced by a factor of ten from the extinction in the optical , potentially offering a less - obscured view of the nuclear emission .",
    "indeed , one of our objects , kug  1238 + 278a , exhibits broad emission lines in the nir spectrum , visible in figure [ fig : spectra ] . in this case",
    "at least , we can be certain we are seeing the nucleus through a screen of dust that obscured agn activity in the optical spectrum .",
    "we provide here a summary of infrared agn selection techniques and whether they recovered objects in our sample .",
    "the results of each test for each object are summarized in table [ t : tab2 ] . in short , we find that nir emission line ratio diagnostics are successful in classifying elusive agn where optical ratios fail , but that these ratios do not differentiate control samples cleanly .",
    "we find that coronal emission lines indicative of the hard ionizing continuum of agn are not present in the nir spectra of our sample , but that we do detect coronal lines in the mid - ir ( mir ) for the subset of our objects with _",
    "we also conclude that infrared photometric techniques are unsuccessful in classifying the majority of our objects .",
    "after we have discussed whether these diagnostics recover our optically normal objects , we proceed to considering the evidence of possible reasons for their optical normalcy .      optical selection of agn is typically done in two ways .",
    "type  1  agn are selected by searching for broad emission lines , usually h@xmath10 , h@xmath11 , and  @xmath12 .",
    "these objects have broad emission lines because our viewing angle allows us to see the gas moving in the gravitational potential of the supermassive black hole .",
    "the area where the gas that produces broad emission lines resides is called the broad - line region ( blr ) .",
    "these lines are typically doppler broadened to widths greater than 1000 km / s .",
    "type  2  agn are viewed through the obscuring dusty torus surrounding the central engine .",
    "consequently , we can only see the narrow emission lines , from gas ionized by the accretion disk but located above the vertical extent of the dusty torus .",
    "the region from which this gas is emitted is referred to as the narrow - line region ( nlr ) .",
    "since star formation produces many of the same emission lines as gas ionized by the central accretion disk , one must use line ratios to distinguish the source of the ionizing radiation .",
    "the accretion disk has a significantly harder ionizing continuum than hii regions can produce , which manifests in different emission line ratios .",
    "four of our eight sources are categorized as optically - elusive , meaning that they exhibit emission lines , but that the traditional line ratio diagnostic bpt ( baldwin - phillips - terlevich ) diagram @xcite characterizes them as star - forming hii regions instead of agn .",
    "@xcite first published the revised version of this diagnostic plot , taking advantage of three sets of line ratios and excluding ratios badly affected by reddening .",
    "@xcite published the modern version of this diagram . using the spectral fitting routine ` gandalf ` ( for more on ` gandalf ` see section [ sec : nucdust ] ) ,",
    "we have calculated the fluxes in the lines necessary for these diagnostics and provided the values in table  [ t : tab3 ] . for xbongs with no evidence of lines ,",
    "we have provided the 2-@xmath2 flux upper limits .",
    "figure  [ fig : kewley ] shows the optical diagnostics discussed above for the four optically elusive objects .",
    "none of the xbongs have at least one detected line in both ratios , so we can not plot upper limits .",
    "the curve in these three figures delineates star - forming regions from agn .",
    "objects in the lower left of the diagram , below the curve , are classified as hii regions associated with star formation .",
    "all four of our objects fail to be classified as agn by these traditional means , despite being unambiguous agn in the ultra - hard x - ray .",
    "since infrared emission is less sensitive to dust extinction than optical , it is possible that such optically elusive objects might be identifiable as agn by near infrared diagnostics instead .",
    "if so , the nir is a cheap alternative to x - ray selection for building a more complete agn sample which includes obscured objects .",
    "@xcite undertook an in - depth study of the excitation sources for the strongest nir spectral features of @xmath13 and [ fe  ii ]  in various emission line galaxies .",
    "in general , the vibrational and rotational modes of @xmath13 can be excited by three mechanisms : uv fluorescence , shock heating , and x - ray heating .",
    "each of these mechanisms excites the various @xmath13 modes differently , so it is possible to tell which is the dominant mechanism by comparing ratios of different @xmath13 lines .",
    "@xcite perform this analysis and find that , in agn , the @xmath13 excitation is thermal , with only a 15% contribution from non - thermal excitation .",
    "this precludes a significant uv fluorescence contribution to the observed @xmath13 in agn , but it does not distinguish between shocks from the central radio jet or x - ray illumination .",
    "[ fe  ii ]  emission in the nir can also be used to distinguish between dominant emission - line excitation mechanisms . a strong correlation between the [ fe  ii ]",
    "emission and the 6 cm radio emission in the central regions of agn , reported by @xcite , suggests that [ fe  ii ]  in seyfert galaxies is predominantly produced by shocks from the central radio jets . @xcite and",
    "other studies have shown that shocks from supernova remnants can produce [ fe  ii ]  in starburst galaxies .",
    "the amount of [ fe  ii ]  produced by photoionization in hii regions versus shock excitation can be constrained by comparing ratios of the [ fe  ii ]  emission with pa  @xmath11 .",
    "the ratio of [ fe  ii ]  to the hydrogen lines will increase as you move from pure photoionization to pure shock excitation .",
    "@xcite first found that seyfert galaxies typically have ratios 0.5  @xmath14  [ fe  ii ]  /  pa  @xmath15  4.6 , and @xcite confirm this finding .",
    "so , [ fe  ii ]  /  pa  @xmath11 can be used to determine whether the [ fe  ii ]  emission is excited by stellar or nonstellar sources .",
    "the nonstellar sources are either x - ray heating or shocks from radio jets ; both are phenomena associated with agn .",
    "@xcite were the first to combine both h@xmath16  2.12  @xmath17 m and [ fe  ii ]  1.257  @xmath17 m into a diagnostic of nuclear activity , noting that @xmath13  /  br  @xmath18 and [ fe  ii ]  /  pa  @xmath11 are linearly correlated , with starburst galaxies occupying the lower end of the relation and agn occupying the intermediate range .",
    "low ionization nuclear emission - line region galaxies ( liners ) occupy the highest end of the relation .",
    "unfortunately , the four xbongs in our sample do not even have lines in the nir ( ngc  4992 , for example , has a featureless continuum across the entire displayed sed ; see figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) , so we can not carry out this test for them .",
    "the optically elusive objects , however , do exhibit all the necessary emission lines to place them on the ir diagnostic diagram first put forth by @xcite and refined by @xcite .",
    "the most recent version of this diagram belongs to @xcite , who enlarged the sample and included supernova remnants and blue compact dwarf galaxies , which are comprised mainly of star forming regions .",
    "their improved limits on line ratios for various levels of activity are as follows : for starbursts , [ fe  ii]/ pa  @xmath19 and @xmath13 / br  @xmath20 ; for agn , @xmath21 [ fe  ii]/ pa  @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath13  /  br  @xmath24 ; and for liners , [ fe  ii ]  /  pa  @xmath25 and @xmath13  /  br  @xmath26 .",
    "we measured the flux in the h@xmath16 2.12  @xmath17 m , br  @xmath18 , [ fe  ii ]  1.257 @xmath17 m , and pa  @xmath11 lines using the iraf routine splot .",
    "the values are given in table  [ t : tab3 ] , and ratios are plotted in figure  [ fig : irdiag ] .",
    "all four objects occupy the region of the plot which , according to the references above , typifies agn .",
    "also plotted are the samples of starburst galaxies and type  2  agn from @xcite , starburst galaxies and hii regions from @xcite , a sample from the @xcite nir atlas of hii regions , and a sample of type  2  agn from @xcite .",
    "as both @xcite and @xcite acknowledge , while agn are indeed located in the region with intermediate values of both line ratios , starbursts and hii regions can have both low and high values on both axes and encroach quite far into the agn regime .",
    "our four optically - elusive objects fall in the agn region of the nir diagnostic diagram , despite failing optical tests . while this is promising evidence that the weaker extinction in the nir allows us to spectroscopically detect nuclear activity , since the diagnostics fail to clearly distinguish between star forming regions and agn , we do not consider this a successful method of recovering buried agn .",
    "there remains no way , by nir line ratios alone , to determine whether the source is an active nucleus or a starburst .",
    "it has been mentioned that uv radiation from star forming regions can excite a similar emission spectrum to that excited by nuclear activity . while this is true , the hard ionizing photons from an agn accretion disk are capable of exciting much higher ionization lines than an hii region .",
    "the coronal lines are collisionally - excited forbidden transitions in highly ionized species , usually with ionization potentials greater than 100 ev . such ips require much harder ionizing radiation than hii regions can emit , and so are considered definite indicators of agn activity .",
    "several coronal lines exist in the region covered by our nir spectra ; namely , [ si  x ] 1.43@xmath17 m , [ si  vi ] 1.963@xmath17 m , and [ ca  viii ] 2.32@xmath17 m .",
    "we searched for these three lines in our nir spectra , and were unable to confirm the detection of coronal lines in any of the xbongs or optically elusive agn .",
    "it is important to note that one would not necessarily expect to find these coronal lines in all type 2 agn ; @xcite report that of a sample of classical type 2 agn , [ si  vi ] was detected in a little more than 40% of the spectra , while [ si  x ] was detected in less than 25% .",
    "they report that in general , high - ionization coronal lines appear less frequently in type 2 than in type 1 objects .",
    "all of our optical spectra would be considered type 2 , since they do not exhibit broad optical emission lines .",
    "therefore , the lack of coronal line detection does not imply the lack of an agn , but their detection does imply the presence of an agn .",
    "three of our objects have public data from the _ spitzer _ mid - to - far ir telescope @xcite .",
    "the [ ne  v ]  line at 14.32@xmath17 m and the  line at 25.90@xmath17 m , like the coronal lines mentioned above , have ionization potentials requiring an agn accretion disk as the ionizing source .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "spectra for these three sources are shown in figure [ fig : spitzer ] .",
    "one source , mrk 18 , is an optically elusive agn ; the other two ( ngc 4686 and ngc 4992 ) are xbongs . for [ ne",
    "v ] , we have a clear detection in mrk  18 , a possible but not significant detection in ngc  4686 , and no detection in ngc  4992 .",
    "all three objects exhibit  emission , even the heavily obscured ngc  4992 .",
    "there have been agn diagnostic techniques developed using mir emission line ratios .",
    "@xcite use the ratio @xmath27 m / [ ne  ii]@xmath28 m with the strength of the 7.7@xmath17 m pah feature to identify the source of the nuclear emission in _ iras _ galaxies .",
    "they find that agn - dominated sources typically have weak 7.7@xmath17 m pah emission and a high / [ ne  ii ]  ratio .",
    "neither ngc  4686 nor ngc  4992 have the requisite pah feature , but mrk  18 has all of the necessary lines to carry out this diagnostic . for mrk  18 , we find that  /  [ ne  ii]= 0.28@xmath290.08 and the relative strength of the 7.7@xmath17 m pah feature to be 2.92@xmath30 ( @xcite define this quantity as the ratio of the peak 7.7@xmath17 m flux to the 7.7@xmath17 m continuum flux as measured by a linear interpolation between 5.9 and 11.0  @xmath17 m ) .",
    "these numbers place mrk  18 solidly in the region of their diagram populated by objects with approximately equal contributions of agn and star formation .",
    "agn are among the very few astronomical objects with strong emission throughout the entire infrared spectral range .",
    "typically , agn continua in this regime are power - laws ; in particular , the mir shape of agn continua is best fit by a function @xmath31 , with @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "this has motivated many investigations into agn selection by mid - ir photometry using the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) , which surveyed the entire sky in four photometric bands ( 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22 @xmath17 m ) .",
    "photometric accuracy in the 22 @xmath17 m band is not typically reliable and coverage in that band is significantly shallower than the other three , so only the first three bands are used in most agn selection schemes .",
    "selection of agn by mir colors should be more complete than in the x - ray , since even in highly obscured agn , the nuclear emission is re - radiated by dust in the mir .",
    "however , if severe dust extinction affects the flux at the lower wise wavelengths , and if the mir colors are not dominated by the agn thermal continuum but instead by the starlight from the host galaxy , an agn will fail the photometric power law criteria .",
    "all eight of our objects have wise data . to see whether they would be classified as agn based on mir photometry , we use three different wise selection schemes from the literature .",
    "first , we use the classification from @xcite : a color cutoff of [ 3.4]-[4.6 ] @xmath33 , which produces an agn sample with 98% reliability and 78% completeness .",
    "second , we use the three - band  agn - wedge \" defined by @xcite , the completeness of which is strongly dependent on agn luminosity .",
    "low - luminosity agn are more likely to have mir colors not defined by the thermal emission from the agn , and so more frequently fail their test .",
    "in particular , only @xmath3439% of type 2 agn with @xmath35  erg  s@xmath5 fall inside their agn color wedge . at @xmath36",
    "erg  s@xmath5 , @xmath3476% of type 2 agn are inside the wedge .",
    "all but one of our objects , 2masx  j1439 + 1415 , have x - ray luminosities in their lower range . finally , we use the @xmath37 algorithm defined by @xcite , which uses the first three _ wise _ bandpasses and finds that most objects with @xmath38 were non - agn while most with @xmath39 tended to be agn . a summary of which objects pass and fail these nir photometric tests is given in table  [ t : tab2 ] .",
    "figure [ fig : irphot ] shows how our objects are classified based on _ wise _ colors in the @xcite and @xcite schemes .",
    "most of the objects conform to our expectations for these tests . of the optically elusive agn , kug  1238",
    "+ 278a is the only one that passes the agn criteria .",
    "this happens for the same reason that we see broad lines in the nir spectrum : the dust extinction is minor enough that we can peer through it in the nir , revealing the nuclear spectrum .",
    "the other optically elusive agn fall outside the selection regions , in the cloud of _ wise _ sources without x - ray detections ( grey in figure [ fig : irphot ] ) .",
    "there are several outliers , however , of the sample of _ wise _ sources with x - ray detections ( cyan in figure [ fig : irphot ] ) which occupy that same region ; we assume , then , that our optically elusive _",
    "swift_-bat agn are among them .    for reasons discussed in detail in later sections",
    ", we believe the xbong 2masx  j1439 + 1415 is a heavily starlight - diluted agn that would otherwise be an optical type 1 and is not subject to major dust obscuration . additionally , it is the only object in the sample with @xmath36  erg  s@xmath5 and has a high eddington ratio , unlike the rest of our sample .",
    "the object passes all three photometric selection criteria . for more detailed discussion of this object ,",
    "see sections [ sec : dilut ] and section  [ sec:2mas ] .",
    "more complex is the case of ngc  4992 .",
    "this xbong is heavily dust obscured and has a nir continuum shape that is definitely not defined by the agn thermal continuum ( see section  [ contfits ] ) .",
    "we successfully detect  in this object s mir _ spitzer _ spectrum .",
    "perhaps the combination of a strong but obscured nuclear component ( assumed from the high x - ray luminosity and column ) and the fact that we begin to penetrate this thick dust in the mir ( as judged from the  detection ) leads to ngc  4992 passing these criteria .",
    "ngc  4992 is discussed in detail in section  [ sec:4992 ] .",
    "the most plausible explanation for the lack of nuclear activity detection at optical wavelengths is extinction by circumnuclear or host galaxy dust .",
    "an optically thick dust distribution concealing the central engine could cause the optical spectrum of a true agn to resemble only the host galaxy , and the emission lines to reflect the star formation in the host that would otherwise be washed out by light from the nucleus .",
    "several tests for significant dust extinction are possible in the optical and nir .",
    "one can look for visible dust in the images , if the obscuring dust is thought to reside in the host galaxy at large .",
    "additional tests include calculation of the @xmath40 reddening , measuring the x - ray column densities ( shown in table [ t : tab1 ] ) , and looking for silicate absorption features in the mir .    as a first handle on the obscuration",
    ", we have measured the x - ray absorbing column density along the line of sight from the photoelectric cutoff in the x - ray spectrum , if the s / n of that spectrum is adequate for the task .",
    "all of our objects except for 2mfgc 00829 have _ swift _ xrt spectra . only kug 1238 + 278a has an xrt spectrum with too much noise to confidently assess the column density .",
    "the calculated values of @xmath41 are given in table [ t : tab1 ] .",
    "as in @xcite , none of our optically normal agn are compton - thick ( @xmath42  @xmath43 ) .",
    "@xcite posit that widespread dust in the host galaxy could be responsible for xbongs . for a sample of only eight objects ,",
    "a statistical examination of the axis ratios would not be enlightening .",
    "we do , however , have good images for most of the objects .",
    "the optical images for our eight objects are shown in figure  [ fig : images ] .",
    "all but 2mfgc 00829 were obtained from sdss ; that object is out of the sloan footprint and so we present here the 2mass jhk image .",
    "only one of our objects , ngc 4686 , shows a prominent dust lane potentially in the line of sight . since 2mfgc 00829",
    "is apparently an edge - on spiral , host galaxy dust is possible in this object as well .",
    "the other galaxies appear to be face - on or do not have obvious dust lanes , and 2masx  j1439 + 1415 is elliptical , and so are unlikely to be plagued by large - scale host galaxy dust .",
    "only one object , kug 1238 + 278a , appears to be interacting .",
    "absorption in the host galaxy beyond the torus was considered by @xcite , but these authors found no evidence of large - scale dust structure in hst images of two of their xbongs , similar to our result .    while we do not see obvious widespread dust in the host galaxies of our objects , a simple subjective analysis of the images is not enough to rule out host galaxy dust as the responsible extinctor .",
    "since the dust does not appear to be present in the host at large , it becomes necessary to check for the existence of circumnuclear dust which could screen the gas ionized by the central engine . to perform a robust calculation of the dust reddening affecting the emission lines",
    ", we use the spectrum fitting code ` gandalf ` .",
    "the code first fits a stellar continuum while masking the regions of the spectrum that contain emission lines , and then measures the gas emission on the residual spectrum of the stellar fit . in order to estimate the intrinsic reddening of the source ,",
    "the program adopts the dust model of @xcite .",
    "examples of ` gandalf ` fits are shown in figure  [ fig : gandalf ] .",
    "the calculated @xmath40 values are listed in table [ t : tab1 ] .",
    "we exclude values for the xbongs since the ` gandalf ` code was only able to find upper limits on the fluxes of the balmer lines in those objects . as a control sample",

    "all eight of the galaxies are well modeled by a combination of a stellar and hot dust blackbody .",
    "we are ignoring small features , like emission lines or absorption troughs , and attempting to fit only the generic continuum shape .",
    "a power law is a very poor fit , even when combined with a blackbody , for all of our objects ; we therefore conclude that we are not seeing nuclear continuum emission , even in the nir .",
    "a single blackbody at the stellar temperature was also a poor fit , despite the fact that the ` gandalf ` fits approximated the optical continuum very well with stellar templates ; thus , there is some nuclear dust contribution in the nir .",

    ", we attribute this to a higher obscuration of the nuclear region of the xbongs , including the hot dust near the sublimation temperature which is putatively on the inner edge of the dusty torus .",
    "indeed , ngc  4686 and ngc  4992 have very high x - ray column densities , @xmath53 and 23.69 , respectively .",
    "the elusive objects , in which we presume obscuration by cool dust to be less important , we see the hot dust component kicking in sooner and contributing more significantly to the long wavelength end of the spectrum . whether or not each object is well fit with a prominent hot dust component is summarized in table  [ t : tab2 ] .",
    "interesting exceptions are the xbong 2masx  j1439 + 1415 and the elusive object ugc  05881 , which exhibit opposite character from those described above .",
    "further , ugc  05881 has the same x - ray column density as fellow elusive object mrk 18 , but has a small hot dust contribution compared to mrk  18 .",
    "the behavior of 2masx  j1439 + 1415 is explained by our theory that is is a starlight - diluted type  1  agn .",
    "these fits are consistent with the hypothesis that the primary reason for optical normalcy in extreme xbongs like ngc  4686 and ngc  4992 is heavy obscuration by a cool dust component beyond the dusty torus .",
    "however , these results should be interpreted with caution : the relationship between the hot and cool dust populations in agn is probably very complex , and a sophisticated analysis of the origin of each type of emission is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "follow - up optical observations of the x - ray sources from deep _ chandra _ surveys have shown that 40% to 60% of the optical counterparts are normal early - type galaxies with weak or no optical emission lines .",
    "these objects are at relatively high redshifts , and so all or most of the galaxy being observed falls inside the spectrograph slit .",
    "this results in a large amount of host galaxy starlight being integrated into the spectrum , effectively hiding the nuclear emission and resulting in a normal galaxy spectrum .",
    "since our objects are not at high redshift ( 0.011 @xmath54 0.071 ) , the spectroscopic fiber does not contain a large fraction of the host galaxy .",

    "the percentage of the total galaxy light that is contained within the central 1.5  radius for each galaxy is given in table [ t : tab1 ] .",
    "values range from @xmath57 , except for ngc 4686 , probably due to its being nearly edge - on , and 2masx j1439 + 1415 , since it is further away than most of our sources at @xmath58 .",
    "note that this is the amount of the total galaxy light contained within the red squares in figure [ fig : images ] .",
    "note also that for 2mfgc 00289 and ngc 4686 , this information is not directly applicable because their optical spectra were not obtained from the sdss .",
    "the starlight dilution paradigm was addressed in detail by @xcite .",
    "these authors simulated observations of distant _ chandra _ sources by integrating the host galaxy spectra of nearby , well - studied type 2 agn and deliberately diluting the spectra with the integrated light .",
    "they find that 60% of their sources would not be classified as agn at the average redshift of the deep _ chandra _ surveys , suggesting that starlight dilution is an important factor in the optical dullness of distant agn .",
    "fortunately , @xcite have recommended a measure of optical dullness that should not be affected by galaxy starlight dilution , since it relies on direct measurements of line fluxes and not on equivalent widths .",
    "a key question about the nature of xbongs is whether or not they are normal agn that simply occupy the tail - end of the standard @xmath59 distribution due to an abundance of starlight . in figure",
    "[ fig : ratio ] , we have plotted the flux in the  @xmath60 emission line versus the flux in the ultra - hard x - ray for our eight objects as well as for the overall _ swift_-bat agn sample . like the @xcite xbongs ,",
    "ours occupy a similar x - ray flux distribution as the majority of the sample , but have substantially different  fluxes .",
    "@xcite argue that this suggests the xbongs are a  truly distinct class \" of agn in terms of the ratio of optical and x - ray flux , and not just the tail end of the standard @xmath59 distribution .",
    "this conclusion , combined with the fact that the sdss fiber does not contain a significant fraction of the exterior regions of the host galaxies , implies that starlight dilution , while certainly relevant to higher redshift samples as suggested by @xcite , is unlikely to be the cause of the optical normalcy of most of the galaxies in our sample .",
    "the sole exception in our sample is 2masx  j1439 + 1415 , which we consider a viable case for starlight dilution .",
    "we note a strong resemblance to the starlight - diluted sample of @xcite ; in particular the presence of h@xmath10 but lack of h@xmath11 and very weak . its greater distance ( @xmath58 ) places a large fraction of the stellar light within the sdss spectroscopic fiber .",
    "the 4000    break is a steep drop off of radiation blueward of 4000   , the combined effect of a dearth of hot blue stars and blanket absorption of high energy radiation by metals .",
    "it is a ubiquitous feature in galaxy spectra .",
    "the strength of the break feature is a tracer of the contribution to the spectrum of galaxy starlight versus nuclear emission , and is given by :    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the average flux density between 4050    and 4250   , and @xmath63 is the average flux density between 3750    and 3950   , as put forth by @xcite . both are measured in the object s rest frame .",
    "the values of @xmath64 for each object are given in table  [ t : tab1 ] .",
    "if nuclear emission is dominant , the value of @xmath64 is very low or negative . the higher the value of @xmath64 , the greater the contribution of host galaxy starlight .    as stated in the introduction ,",
    "@xcite conclude that starlight dilution is the primary driver behind the optical dullness of their sample of elusive agn from the _ xmm - newton _ bright serendipitous survey .",
    "they show that the strength of the break is anticorrelated with the unabsorbed x - ray luminosity .",
    "we can measure the 4000    break strength for all of our objects except ngc 4686 , since its optical spectrum does not extend blueward far enough .    in figure [ fig:4000a ] , we reproduce figure 4 of @xcite , including our objects . to scale their de - absorbed x - ray luminosities from the _ xmm - newton",

    "immediately obvious is that our sample is not concurrent with their sample of elusive agn .",
    "this is most likely because their sample has an average redshift of @xmath67 , considerably higher than ours , allowing more of the host galaxy light to occupy the slit .",
    "our objects occupy a similar x - ray space as their optically elusive agn , but are lower in @xmath64 space and thus have less galaxy contribution to the optical spectrum .",
    "two objects are outliers : the xbongs ngc 4992 and 2masx j1439 + 1415 . in the case of ngc 4992",
    ", we believe the galaxy contributes strongly due to extreme dust obscuration near the nucleus .",
    "the position of 2masx j1439 + 1415 supports our theory that this object is optically normal because of starlight dilution , since it has a high value of @xmath64 and a high x - ray luminosity , similar to the starlight - diluted type 2 agn in the diagram .",
    "the optically - elusive agn , which exhibit emission line ratios characteristic of star - forming hii regions , could be explained by an excess of star formation in the host galaxy , or a circumnuclear starburst .",
    "if the nuclear emission is relatively weak , such a starburst could outshine it , and cause the line ratios to indicate hii region activity rather than activity from the central engine .",
    "we note here that one should use caution when considering star formation and the infrared line ratios presented in section [ sec : linerat ] . the emission used in that diagnostic",
    "could potentially be excited by supernovae or uv radiation from o and b stars ( see section [ sec : linerat ] ) .    to determine the degree to",
    "which star formation is affecting our sample , we obtained @xmath68 photometry from sdss for the seven of our objects in that database ( this excludes 2mfgc 00829 ) .",

    "the average for our sample is @xmath69 .",
    "we assembled a control sample of type 2 seyferts selected by the optical line ratio diagnostics from @xcite , and selected smaller control samples for each object based on total stellar mass .",
    "for this control sample of matched stellar mass , the average is @xmath70 , the same as for our sample .",
    "we conclude that our objects are not systematically bluer than a control sample of similar @xmath71 , and are thus unlikely to be seriously affected by star formation .",
    "however , if our objects are highly dust obscured , there could still be significant star formation detectable only in the re - radiated infrared .",
    "additionally , sdss photometric magnitudes are taken for the integrated galaxy within the petrosian radius , not only for the nucleus . since our spectra",
    "are mostly nuclear , it is of interest to see whether the photometry of the central regions might indicate a circumnuclear starburst .",
    "the sdss also makes available the  fiber magnitudes \" for each photometric object , which are the magnitudes of the regions of the galaxy inside the 3  sdss spectroscopic fiber ( i.e. , the magnitudes from the region inside the red boxes in figure [ fig : images ] ) .",

    "there is no difference between our galaxies and a matched-@xmath71 control sample of type 2 agn .",
    "interestingly , both our sample and the control sample were , on average , redder in the fiber magnitudes than for the integrated photometry .",

    "@xcite postulated that these are likely caused by bending and stretching of complex carbon molecules in star forming regions .",
    "the strong detection of these lines in mrk 18 imply a nuclear starburst in this object , which could very well be why optical line ratios classify it as an hii region instead of an agn .",
    "an independent measurement of the star formation rate ( sfr ) can be obtained for those of our objects with _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( galex ) far - uv data .",

    "since the classical accretion disk is responsible for the widespread ionizing radiation that produces the agn emission lines , it is possible that an object with a radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) might not exhibit emission lines .",

    "we have shown that the lack of optical indicators of agn activity in our sample is unlikely to be explained by a high star formation rate overwhelming the nuclear emission , since our sample does not have @xmath68 colors significantly different than a control sample with similar @xmath71 in either whole - galaxy or nuclear photometry .",

    "interestingly , we note that this object has a candidate  voorwerp \" nearby , from the galaxy zoo survey for agn - ionized gas clouds by @xcite .",
    "those authors state that it would be quite interesting to see the gas cloud being ionized by an agn when no agn was clearly present .",
    "kug 1238 + 278a is such a case ; in the optical , the only indication of agn activity in this object is its voorwerp .",
    "mrk 18 is a previously unknown agn , first discovered in the hard x - ray , and @xcite suggest this is because of  extinction of the optical emission lines . \"",
    "@xcite classify it as an hii region / liner , as we do .",
    "our strongest candidate for nuclear starburst activity , this object exhibits strong pah features associated with star formation in its _ spitzer _",
    "it is unlikely to be seriously affected by dust obscuration , since its @xmath40 value is quite low ( 0.05 ) and the _ spitzer _ spectrum does not show silicate absorption troughs .",
    "it has numerous agn diagnostics in the infrared , including the detection of mir high ionization lines [ ne  v ]  and , as well as nir emission line ratio diagnostics .",
    "finally , mrk  18 falls in the hybrid sb / agn portion of the @xcite mir classification diagram .",
    "we believe that , rather than heavy extinction , this object s line ratios are affected by a nuclear starburst , causing it to fail classical optical agn ratio tests .",
    "some nuclear dust may slightly reduce the agn contribution to the optical lines with respect to the nir lines , since the object passes nir line diagnostics .",
    "this xbong is almost certainly optically normal due to dust obscuration .",
    "@xcite classify this object as a radio - quiet agn of the xbong type .",
    "it has a high x - ray column density and its _ spitzer _ spectrum exhibits silicate absorption , although not to the same extreme degree as ngc  4992 .",
    "we do not significantly detect [ ne  v ]  in the nir spectrum , but we do detect  in the mir spectrum ( see figure [ fig : spitzer ] ) , which is an unambiguous agn indicator . since ngc  4686 is not an sdss spectroscopic target and its spectrum does not extend blueward enough to contain the 4000    break , we can not estimate the amount of starlight dilution present in our optical spectrum from kitt peak .",
    "the nir spectrum , like the optical , has no emission lines and the nir continuum fit is consistent with a stellar population with a minimal hot dust contribution , probably shielded by colder dust .",
    "the obscuration may be due to host galaxy dust , since a dust lane is clearly present in the image .",
    "@xcite nicely summarizes the literature on this object ; in short , it has multiple conflicting optical classifications ranging from totally inactive @xcite to type 1 agn @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that the x - ray properties imply an obscured agn .",
    "we do detect mir  emission in this object , which is an agn indicator , and it passes two nir photometric tests for reasons that are unclear .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "spectrum shows very prominent silicate troughs , which dominate the continuum .",
    "such deep troughs are typical of agn / starburst composite objects in the @xcite mir atlas of nearby agn , but ngc 4992 lacks the strong pah features characteristic of such composites . however ,",
    "the pah emitting regions in this object may be blocked by dust , with the rest of the nuclear regions .",
    "it has the highest x - ray column density of any of our objects .",
    "all indicators suggest that this is agn is heavily dust obscured .",
    "this face - on barred spiral galaxy is optically elusive and classifies as a starburst / hii region on optical line ratio diagnostic diagrams . like with ngc 4686 ,",
    "@xcite call it a radio - quiet agn of the xbong type .",
    "we do not believe starlight dilution is a viable explanation for the optical normalcy of this object for several reasons : it is nearby ( @xmath82 ) , the sdss spectrum is quite nuclear , and the strength of the 4000    break is consistent with type 2 agn and even some type 1 agn ( see figure [ fig:4000a ] ) .",
    "it does not have an unusually low eddington ratio . since we do not have a mir spectrum for this object",
    ", we do not know if it exhibits pah features or silicate absorption .",
    "its face - on orientation , however , precludes dust absorption on large scales in the host galaxy along the line of sight .",
    "so , this object possibly hosts a nuclear starburst , the emission lines from which dominate the emission lines from gas ionized by the agn itself due to dust blocking the nucleus .",
    "in addition to the _ swift_-bat survey , ugc 05881 was also detected by the ibis instrument on _",
    "integral_. @xcite classify the _",
    "integral _ source optically as a low - ionization nuclear emission line region ( liner ) and as compton - thin .",
    "interestingly , those authors claim that there is no reddening local to the agn host , and thus declare it a  naked \" liner , which is the first of its kind . the optical classification of liner is not entirely inconsistent with our optical classification as an hii region , since the object falls in the composite regime between star formation and agn - dominated ; i.e. , between the @xcite and @xcite demarcations .",
    "we do , however , find that there is local reddening on the order of @xmath83 .",
    "the object is successfully classified as an agn using nir emission line diagnostics ; therefore we believe there is some slight nuclear dust obscuration causing it to fail optical agn diagnostics .",
    "interestingly , the nir continuum fit for this object resembles the xbongs , rather than the optically elusive agn , in that it is best matched by a predominant stellar component and only a small hot dust contribution .",
    "perhaps the slight obscuration of this object is due to large - scale colder dust in the central regions of this barred spiral galaxy .",
