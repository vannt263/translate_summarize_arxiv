    "to fit the h@xmath14cl ( hereafter hcl ) @xmath12 = 10 spectrum , we used the gildas class tool to fit the hcl(10 ) spectrum , which gives the best fit of the hyperfine components providing four parameters : ( i ) the lsr velocity , ( ii ) the linewidth ( fwhm ) , ( iii ) the sum of the opacity at the central velocities of all the hyperfine components @xmath39@xmath40 , and ( iv ) the product @xmath41 = @xmath42 @xmath43 [ @xmath12(@xmath44)@xmath12(@xmath45)@xmath12(@xmath46 ) ] , where @xmath47 and @xmath46 is the temperature of the continuum emission . in the l1157-b1 case , @xmath12(@xmath46 ( no dust - continuum so far detected towards b1 , e.g. codella et al .",

    "the undetected weakest hyperfine component @xmath27=1/21/2 indicates that the opacity of the main hyperfine component ( @xmath27=5/23/2 ) is lower than 1 . since the derived @xmath44 depends on the opacity and the assumed source extent ( to reproduce the observed @xmath25 ) , we derived three possible solutions assuming different source sizes .",
    "in fact , l1157-b1 is a well - known clumpy arch - like structure , with a whole size around 15@xmath1 ( e.g. the ch@xmath49cn map reported by codella et al .",

    "although observed with a low s / n , seems to exclude the association with high - velocity wings .",
    "thus , we assumed three cases : 10@xmath1 , 15@xmath1 , and extended emission ( i.e. a filling factor equal to unity ) .",
    "the latter case allows us to verify whether the hcl emission comes from the parent molecular cloud . assuming the highest possible line opacity ( @xmath50 ) , the derived minimum @xmath44 values are : 5 k ( extended ) , and @xmath9 7 k ( 10@xmath115@xmath1 ) .",

    "the hcl(10 ) transition is associated with a critical density larger than 4 @xmath43 10@xmath52 @xmath6 for temperatures larger than 10 k ( neufeld & green 1994 ) and the upper level energy is @xmath930 k. thus , the corresponding line emission is expected to trace dense and relatively warm gas .",

    "the collisional coefficients can be significantly different for h@xmath11 in @xmath54 and in @xmath55 .",
    "as it is difficult to quantify the differences between hcl - he and hcl - h@xmath11 , and to avoid the introduction of additional free parameters ( e.g. the h@xmath11 ortho - to - para ratio ) , we have simply scaled the hcl - he rates by the standard factor of 1.38 .",
    "this implies that the derived n(hcl ) may be an overestimate , a result that does not affect the major conclusion of this study .",

    "<S> we present the first detection of hydrogen chlorine in a protostellar shock , by observing the fundamental transition at 626 ghz with the herschel hifi spectrometer . </S>",
    "<S> we detected two of the three hyperfine lines , from which we derived a line opacity @xmath0 . using a non - lte lvg code </S>",
    "<S> , we constrained the hcl column density , temperature and density of the emitting gas . </S>",
    "<S> the hypothesis that the emission originates in the molecular cloud is ruled out , as it would imply a too dense gas . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , assuming that the emission originates in the 10@xmath115@xmath1 size shocked gas previously observed at the iram pdb interferometer , we obtain : n(hcl)=0.72@xmath2 @xmath3 , temperature @xmath4 15 k and density @xmath4 3 @xmath5 @xmath6 . combining with the herschel hifi co(54 ) </S>",
    "<S> observations allows to further constrain the gas density and temperature , 10@xmath710@xmath8 @xmath6 and 120250 k , as well as the hcl column density , 2@xmath2 @xmath3 , and , finally , abundance : @xmath9 36 @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated hcl abundance is consistent with that previously observed in low- and high- mass protostars . </S>",
    "<S> this puzzling result in the l1157-b1 shock , where species from volatile and refractory grains components are enhanced , suggests either that hcl is not the main reservoir of chlorine in the gas phase , against previous chemical models predictions , or that the elemental chlorine abundance is low in l1157-b1 . </S>",
    "<S> astrochemical modelling suggests that hcl is in fact formed in the gas phase , at low temperatures , prior to the occurance of the shock , and that the latter does not enhance its abundance . </S>"
