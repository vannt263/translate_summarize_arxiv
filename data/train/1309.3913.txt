    "double pomeron exchange mechanism is known to be responsible for high - energy central production of mesons with @xmath5 . while it is clear that the effective pomeron must be a colour singlet the spin structure of the pomeron and its coupling to hadrons is , however ,",

    "it is commonly assumed that the pomeron has effectively a vectorial nature ; see for instance @xcite for the history and many references .",
    "this model of the pomeron is being questioned in @xcite .",
    "recent activity in the field concentrated rather on perturbative aspects of the pomeron .",
    "for instance , the production of heavy objects ( @xmath6  mesons @xcite , higgs bosons @xcite , dijets @xcite , @xmath7  pairs @xcite , etc . ) has been considered in the language of unintegrated gluon distributions .",

    "particularly interesting is the transition between the nonperturbative ( small meson transverse momenta ) and perturbative ( large meson transverse momenta ) regimes . here",
    "we wish to concentrate rather on central exclusive meson production in the nonperturbative region using the notion of effective pomeron . in general",
    ", such an object may have a nontrivial spin structure .    in the present analysis we explore the hypothesis of `` tensorial pomeron '' in the central meson production .",
    "the theoretical arguments for considering an effective tensorial ansatz for the nonperturbative pomeron are sketched in @xcite and are discussed in detail @xcite .",
    "hadronic correlation observables could be particularly sensitive to the spin aspects of the pomeron .",

    "such tests were discussed in @xcite and in the following we shall compare our results with those of ref .",

    "there are some attempts to obtain the pomeron - pomeron - meson vertex in special models of the pomeron . in  @xcite results",
    "were obtained from the assumption that the pomeron acts as a @xmath10 conserved and non - conserved current .",
    "the general structure of helicity amplitudes of the simple regge behaviour was also considered in ref .",

    "the detailed structure of the amplitudes depends on dynamics and can not be predicted from the general principles of regge theory .",
    "the mechanism for central production of scalar glueball based on the `` instanton '' structure of qcd vacuum was considered in @xcite . in the present paper",

    "we label the vertex ( [ bare_vertex_pompoms ] ) with @xmath36 since it has no momenta , and ( [ bare_vertex_pompoms_bis ] ) with @xmath186 since it is quadratic in the momenta .",
