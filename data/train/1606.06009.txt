    "the problem of electrons moving in a periodic potential under the influence of an external magnetic field has been rigorously investigated , giving rise to several phenomena such as quantum hall effect@xcite , superconducting flux phases  @xcite and the famous hofstadter butterfly  @xcite , to name a few . despite the simplicity of the problem , many aspects of it still remain unresolved due to the paucity of both experimental and exact theoretical results .",
    "one can think of the problem in two limiting cases , in one , the lattice potential is much weaker than the cyclotron frequency , the problem reduces to free electron landau eigenstates . on the other hand , when the strength of the periodic potential is comparable to the cyclotron energy , one can solve the tight - binding hamiltonian of the bloch electrons by peierls substitution in the hopping term , which produces the hofstadter butterfly @xcite .",
    "the energy spectrum is found to depend critically on the ratio @xmath0 ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 are positive integers , the ratio of the magnetic flux per plaquette to the flux quantum ) . if @xmath0 is a rational number , each energy band is split into @xmath2 subbands by the magnetic field .",
    "the hofstadter butterfly reveals a recursive structure for a rational flux and a cantor set at an irrational flux .",
    "the fascinating nature of the butterfly is a characteristic feature of 2d systems .",
    "similar to the case of landau levels , the dimensionality of the system is of crucial importance for the hofstadter butterfly .",
    "the movement of electrons in the external magnetic field is responsible for the broadening of the hofstadter bands",
    ". they may eventually overlap and smear out the original fractal structure of the energy spectrum ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "there are a number of theoretical studies to reveal this fractal spectrum in presence of several parameters such as electron - phonon coupling @xcite , rashba - spin - orbit coupling @xcite and disorder @xcite .",
    "the main challenge in realizing this recursive structure is the requirement of extremely high magnetic field .",
    "there are recent indications of this kind of structure in some artificial superlattices by enhancing the lattice scale to the magnetic length scale  @xcite . on the other hand , remarkable developments of experimental techniques in ultracold gases in recent years",
    "have allowed search for novel states of matter which go beyond the possibilities already offered by conventional condensed matter systems . engineered optical lattices with laser - induced tunnelling amplitudes",
    "has enabled the realization of artificial high gauge fields with remarkable tunability .",
    "one of the most interesting developments in ultracold atomic physics is the study of neutral atoms in optical lattices  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that properties of low - dimensional systems may be completely changed by the presence of correlations .",
    "electronic correlation itself can induce several many - body effects like metal - insulator transitions , charge - density waves and antiferromagnetism .",
    "usually , hubbard model is the prototype correlated system .",
    "however , one can also have two types of electrons , considered by falicov and kimball , a mobile electron and a massive localized electron , interacting with each other locally .",
    "since the falicov - kimball model ( fkm ) is one of the simplest models of correlated systems and has a number of analytical and numerical results available on square lattices , it can be used to study correlation effects  @xcite on hofstadter spectrum .",
    "moreover , recently , there are proposals for the realization of fkm in optical lattices with mixtures of light atoms and heavy atoms  @xcite in the context of cold atom systems .",
    "a gauge - field can be experimentally realized for ultracold particles ( fermions and bosons ) in optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "several experiments in optical lattices have confirmed hofstadter physics@xcite .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to examine the structure of the hofstadter butterfly in the presence of electronic correlations .",
    "triggered by the intriguing results on a square lattice , attempts have been made to unravel this structure in a hexagonal lattice to see the effect of lattice geometry on hofstadter butterfly@xcite .",
    "the self - similar fractal energy structure depends sensitively on the geometry of the underlying lattice , as well as the applied magnetic field .",
    "moreover , the finite size of the systems seriously affects the energy spectrum .",
    "electrons on a finite size square lattice in the presence of perpendicular magnetic field were studied in order to see the effects of boundary conditions and hubbard type of coulomb correlations recently  @xcite . in this study",
    ", we consider a non - bipartite lattice i.e. , a triangular lattice in presence of both magnetic field and fkm - type of electron correlation .",
    "the particle - hole symmetry of the square lattice is no longer extant . in order to incorporate finite size effects as well as electronic correlations on hofstadter butterfly ,",
    "we start with an fkm on a finite system with both open and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "to study the effect of coulomb repulsion on hofstadter spectrum in different lattices we have used a spinless , fkm at half - filling , as we ignore the zeeman effect which effectively projects out the  wrong - spin \" sector to high energies at high magnetic fields .",
    "@xmath3 where @xmath4 are nearest - neighbour site indices on a square lattice ( lattice constant @xmath5 ) , @xmath6 are itinerant ( localized ) electron annihilation operators at site @xmath7 .",
    "the first term is the kinetic energy due to hopping between nearest neighbours , where , @xmath8 is the hopping integral for @xmath9-electrons ( taken as 1 throughout our calculation ) .",
    "the second term represents on - site coulomb interaction between @xmath9 ( density @xmath10 ) and @xmath11-electrons ( at @xmath12 , with density @xmath13 ; @xmath14 being the number of sites ) .",
    "this hamiltonian commutes with @xmath15 , in which case local occupancy of @xmath11-electron is either 0 or 1 .",
    "since the @xmath11-electron occupation number is a ` classical variable ' , the hamiltonian can be ` solved ' by using a monte carlo annealing over the @xmath11-electron configurations .    when a magnetic field normal to the plane of the lattice is switched on , the field couples to the spinless , mobile fermions via canonically conjugate momenta only .",
    "zeeman coupling being absent , the field couples to the ` orbital degrees ' .",
    "we choose the landau gauge @xmath16 , for a uniform magnetic field of magnitude @xmath17 perpendicular to the 2d - plane of the lattice , electrons propagating along @xmath18 and @xmath19 would acquire a different phase shift and that would induce an interference between them , due to the aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "thus the @xmath19-directional hopping picks up a ` peierls phase ' @xmath20 = @xmath21 ; one can consider a plane - wave along this direction .",
    "@xmath22 = @xmath23 is the flux per plaquette of a square lattice which is the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) phase around a closed path along the plaquette .",
    "we consider only rational magnetic flux , i.e. , @xmath24 with @xmath25 co - prime integers and the dirac flux quantum is @xmath26 .",
    "lattice periodicity is lost along the @xmath18-direction due to the magnetic field . as is customary ,",
    "the lattice is discretized considering @xmath27 - each site is then indexed by an integer  @xmath28 \" along x - direction .",
    "the hamiltonian invariant only for lattice translations in the magnetic translation group  @xcite .",
    "this leads to a unit cell @xmath2 times larger than the original one to accommodate an integer flux @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , to enfold a magnetic flux @xmath30 = @xmath31 , the magnetic supercell now becomes a strip of length @xmath32 @xcite ( in this calculation the maximum @xmath33 is used ) . in the non - interacting limit @xmath34",
    ", the energy spectrum vs magnetic field plot displays a self - similar structure on a square lattice .",
    "as we see from fig.1 , this fractal structure shows some clear gaps , known as hofstadter gaps which appear and disappear depending on the strength of the applied magnetic field .",
    "next , we consider the same problem on a triangular lattice . in the absence of a magnetic field , it has a band dispersion @xmath35 and the atom at the origin has six neighbours at @xmath36 and @xmath37 represents the wave vector of an electron and @xmath38 is the lattice constant . with assymetric gauge",
    ", we can write down the tight - binding hamiltonian as below    @xmath39\\\\{\\rm{where } } , \\\\",
    "{ \\varphi _ { ij } } = 0;\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,i = ( m + 1,n)\\,,\\,j = ( m , n ) \\\\    { \\varphi _ { ij } } = 2\\pi m\\phi ; \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,i = ( m , n)\\,\\,,j = ( m ,",

    "if we do a peierls substitution in the tight - binding hamiltonian for an electron in a triangular lattice , we will have phases associated with four nearest neighbour hoppings , which makes an angle @xmath40 and @xmath41 with respect to the @xmath18-direction respectively .",
    "the hopping parameter along @xmath18-direction is @xmath42 , along @xmath43 direction @xmath44 , and along @xmath41-direction @xmath45 .",
    "the lattice is discretized by assuming @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the magnetic flux through each unit cell@xcite . if we plot the energy eigenvalues with respect to external magnetic flux we get the hofstadter butterfly for the triangular lattice ( see fig.2)@xcite",
    "first , we consider non - interacting two - dimensional systems in presence of a large orbital magnetic field .",
    "it was shown by hasegawa et al .",
    "@xcite that for tight - binding electrons moving in a strong gauge field in a 2d lattice , there are some special values of flux at which the total energy per site becomes a minimum .",
    "for a square lattice , it was found that the energy - minimizing flux @xmath50 is exactly equal to the electron - filling ( @xmath51 ) whereas for a triangular lattice , it is equal to half of the filling . for a square lattice , at @xmath52 ,",
    "the energy is lowered by the lowest group of states just below the largest commensurabilty gap @xcite at the lower energy side ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "this theorem has been checked in our case for both @xmath34 ( see fig.2 , inset 2(a ) and fig.3 , inset fig.3(a ) ) and @xmath53 .",
    "we can conclude that this theorem is valid even in the presence of interaction ( see fig.2(b ) , fig.3(b ) ) .",
    "this rule checks out for all the cases discussed below .",
    "we study the effect of a finite boundary on such recursive structures .",
    "if a landau gauge is chosen , we have essentially a plane wave along one direction while the other direction remains open - effectively a cylindrical geometry . for an infinite system ,",
    "hofstadter energy spectrum depends precisely on @xmath50 , the magnetic flux per plaquette of the lattice , divided by the unit of flux quantum . for rational @xmath50 ( @xmath54 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are co - prime integers ) the spectrum splits into q sub - bands and each state",
    "is @xmath2-fold degenerate . on the other hand , the hofstadter spectrum with torus geometry i.e.",
    ", a lattice with periodic boundary conditions and rational magnetic flux through the plaquette , shows well - defined gaps .",
    "although the qualitative aspect of the spectrum remains invariant for several kinds of boundaries , some extra states show up inside the hofstadter gaps .",
    "fig.4(a ) shows these extra states appearing inside the large and small gaps in the hofstadter spectrum for a finite size square lattice .",
    "these states remain even if the system size is increased .",
    "we introduce the fkm - type coulomb correlation on this structure at half - filling , the half - filled fkm has a charge - density - wave ( cdw ) ground state @xcite . at half - filling",
    "the localized @xmath11-electrons fill up one of the two sublattices of the square lattice ( the so called chessboard structure ) and the corresponding ground state is insulating for all @xmath55 . at half - filling ,",
    "as we increase @xmath56 , the gap also increases and the gap in the spectrum has exactly the same value as @xmath56 .",
    "we examine the effects of lattice sizes on the energy spectrum for a triangular lattice .",
    "as seen from fig.5 the spectrum contains some extra states ( compare with fig.2 ) which survive even if we increase the system sizes from @xmath57 to @xmath58",
    ". then we study the effect of coulomb correlations on these states at different magnetic fluxes . in the fkm , the @xmath9-electrons sample the annealed disordered background of @xmath11-electrons",
    "( @xmath59 only ) and a monte carlo annealing over all @xmath11-electron configurations get us the minimum energy configuration .",
    "it was found that at half - filling the triangular lattice has a diagonal stripe pattern in the range of @xmath60 to @xmath61 , which confirms earlier findings . for lower values of @xmath56",
    ", the ground state does not show any specific order @xcite .",
    "we have obtained the ordered ground state configuration at half - filling and used it for our calculations .",
    "we compute the density of states ( dos ) of @xmath9-electrons for various values of @xmath56 on a @xmath62 lattice under both periodic ( pbc ) and open boundary conditions ( obc ) . the structure of the hofstadter butterfly is greatly modified and hofstadter band - gaps and bandwidths",
    "are also modified under the effect of coulomb repulsion ( see fig.6 , also compare with fig.2 ) .",
    "we have shown in fig.8 the variation in the dos at different magnetic fields for several @xmath56 values .",
    "figs.7 and 8 show how the dos depends on the magnetic field and the magnitude of the coulomb repulsion simultaneously .",
    "there are theoretical reports of localization induced by random magnetic fields in a 2d noninteracting electronic system , confirmed by several groups @xcite . in the context of 2d localization ,",
    "magnetic fields can induce a metal - insulator transition by controlling the degeneracy of the landau levels @xcite . in our case , even in the absence of electron correlation one can see gap induced in the dos ( at @xmath63 ) solely due to the external magnetic field .",
    "this is an example , where one can see metal to insulator transition due to application of external magnetic field . for weak",
    "to moderate coulomb repulsion , the dos strongly depends on the magnetic field . on the other hand , in the absence of a magnetic field",
    ", electronic correlations can also open up a gap in the dos ( fig.8(f ) ) . for a triangular lattice with open boundary conditions",
    ", the field brings in extra states inside the hofstadter gaps , which appear at rational values of flux . for a strong magnetic field",
    "the dos becomes robust against coulomb correlation .",
    "this result already suggests that the coulomb interaction modifies various parts of the hofstadter butterfly in different ways .",
    "as seen from the plot , states which appear due to the finite size effects progressively vanish with the addition of coulomb repulsion for some values of the flux within the range of @xmath56 used here .",
    "a further increase of @xmath56 causes an enhanced band gap .",
    "although not shown here , at larger values of @xmath56 no further qualitative change in the dos occurs , except a larger band gap and narrower bandwidth of the spectrum .",
    "we calculate the magnitude of the gap with the magnetic field as well as @xmath56 .",
    "as it is seen from fig.9 , the gap varies in a different way in the presence and absence of correlation . in the non - interacting limit",
    ", the gap has a maximum at @xmath64 , and the opposite happens at the same place for finite @xmath56 .",
    "introduction of the magnetic field in the hopping term of the hamiltonian of eq(1 ) breaks the temporal invariance of the hamiltonian and gives rise to persistent current of the charged particles . for any bond connecting neighboring sites @xmath65 of the lattice",
    ", we define @xmath66 for hopping along @xmath18 ; @xmath20 = @xmath21 for hopping along @xmath19-direction .",
    "we calculate the local bond current @xmath67 $ ] ,    the results obtained from exact diagonalization for an @xmath68 square lattice are summarized .",
    "note that for a square lattice we restrict ourselves to the interval @xmath50 ( @xmath69 ) , as the hamiltonian is invariant under @xmath70 , while @xmath71 only changes the magnetic field direction .",
    "fig.10 shows the current profile in the ground state for different interaction strengths and @xmath50 values for a square lattice .",
    "the current patterns found for all @xmath56 look similar to those obtained at @xmath34 although the magnitude of current reduces with @xmath56 .",
    "note that the central current reverses sign beyond some critical flux @xmath72 , and this value is same for all @xmath56 .",
    "the edge current shows an oscillation with @xmath50 , in the presence of @xmath56 : a reduction in the magnitude of edge current is observed , but the pattern of oscillation is fixed in all cases . as there is a change of sign of orbital current at about @xmath72 ,",
    "the same is reflected for the boundary current ; at this flux , edge current goes to zero and reverses sign .",
    "there is a similar study on the currents on a finite square lattice in a bose hubbard model @xcite .",
    "the current rotates in opposite direction at some specific range of flux in that case as well . since the effect exists even when @xmath73 and in the bulk too , it is connected to the change in the fermi surface topology ( particle - like or hole - like ) at that flux as seen in the hofstadter spectrum at about @xmath74 .",
    "the same calculation has been done on a triangular lattice for which @xmath75 with @xmath76 at half - filling .",
    "11 shows current configurations for some magnetic flux for a half - filled triangular lattice in the non - interacting as well as finite-@xmath56 regime . as @xmath56",
    "is increased , current is found to avoid the sites which are occupied by @xmath11-electrons and flow though a narrow channel ( fig .",
    "edge current in an interacting triangular lattice at half - filling changes sign at @xmath77 , although there is no such regular pattern in the edge current variation at a finite @xmath56 .",
    "we have checked for the finite size effects on a triangular lattice in the presence of magnetic field .",
    "further , we study the effect of coulomb interaction on this system .",
    "there is a competition between the applied magnetic field and the electronic correlation .",
    "the magnetic field induces a gap ( largest at @xmath63 ) in the density of states even in the absence of correlation . at finite @xmath56",
    ", however , this gap reduces from its @xmath73 value and becomes smallest at @xmath63 . for a finite size system ,",
