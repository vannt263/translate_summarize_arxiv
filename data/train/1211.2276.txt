    "superfluid flow in a toroidal trap is stabilized by a large energy barrier between the current - carrying state and a state with lower angular momentum  @xcite . however , in mesoscopic systems , such as atomic bose - einstein condensates , the barrier can be sufficiently small that the system can tunnel quantum - mechanically to a state of lower angular momentum  @xcite ; furthermore , if the short - range interparticle interactions are attractive or very weakly repulsive , such a barrier does not exist , and the system can transition smoothly from the current - carrying state , to , the non - rotating ground state .",

    "this behavior arises from the presence of multiple minima in the energy landscape ( separated by a maximum or saddle - point which represents an unstable mode ) and is characterized by the appearance of a _ swallow - tail loop _ in the lowest - lying adiabatic energy level and a fold - over in the occupation probability of the corresponding state as functions of the rotation frequency ( see fig .",

    "this proves our previous statement that the critical disorder strength for which a cusp or a loop first appears is @xmath145 or , in other words , @xmath146 .",
    "in this paper , we analyze the stability of a bose - einstein condensate in a rotating toroidal trap in terms of the normal modes of small - amplitude deviations from a metastable current - carrying state .",
    "we identify regions of energetic and dynamical instabilities in the phase space as functions of the interparticle interaction strength and rotation rate of the trap . describing the coupling of the system to the rotation of the trap by a symmetry - breaking disorder perturbation to the original hamiltonian",
    ", we investigate the steady - state and the general dynamics of this system in a two - mode mean - field model .",
    "we find that in the presence of these disorders , swallow - tail loops appear in the lowest - lying energy band for sufficiently strong interaction strengths and , as the rotation rate is varied , force a sudden , non - adiabatic change in the state of the system and the population of the two constituent states .",
    "finally , we investigate the connection of this system with a system of two condensates tunneling in a double - well potential and find these two systems to have identical dynamics ; therefore , the analog of the phenomenon of self - trapping also appears in the system studied in this paper .",
    "we calculate the onset and the properties of self - trapping , and show how the steady - state self - trapped states are described in terms of the energy eigenstates .",
    "the next step , which we discuss in a future publication , is to include the effects of non - zero temperature on the detailed time - dependence of a bose gas rotating in an annulus . at finite temperature ,",
    "the angular momentum and energy of the condensate need not be conserved . as a result ,",
    "thermal , as well as quantum , fluctuations can induce transitions between metastable states , as has been observed experimentally  @xcite . furthermore , the coupling of an unstable condensate to the environment would allow it to evolve to a stable configuration .",
