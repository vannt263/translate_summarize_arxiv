    "accretion onto black holes is the most efficient known method of liberating the rest - mass energy of matter and it is generally accepted that accretion through an orbiting disk is the engine that produces the luminosity emerging from active galactic nuclei and galactic x - ray binary systems .",
    "increasingly sophisticated observations are now providing detailed information that may soon lead to improved understanding of the dynamics of this accreting gas , and , by inference , the properties of the strong gravitational fields around black holes .    what has become the standard model for how mass arrives at black holes and radiates light along the way was first presented in @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the flow is assumed to be time - steady , axisymmetric , and geometrically thin , and follows circular keplerian orbits at all radii outside the innermost stable circular orbit ( the  isco \" , which has radius @xmath4 ) .",
    "inter - ring torques act to decrease slowly the specific angular momentum in the orbiting gas , allowing accretion to occur . at and inside the isco ,",
    "these torques are assumed to vanish , and whatever angular momentum and energy remain in the gas is deposited in the central black hole ; this boundary condition determines the net flux of angular momentum throughout the time - steady disk .",
    "application of the principles of conservation of angular momentum and energy then defines the radial profile of all vertically - integrated properties of the accretion flow .",
    "in particular , conservation of energy demands that the difference between the work done in some annulus by the torques and the net potential energy lost as matter flows across the annulus be deposited locally as heat .",
    "the assumption of geometrical thinness embedded in the standard model is equivalent to the assumption that all the dissipated heat is radiated locally . because the accretion inside the isco is assumed to be in free - fall , the integrated luminosity per unit rest - mass accreted",
    ", i.e. the radiative efficiency of accretion , is identically equal to the binding energy per unit rest - mass at the isco .",
    "this efficiency ranges from @xmath5 for a schwarzschild black hole hole to as high as @xmath6 for a maximally spinning kerr hole .    in the notation of @xcite , the radial dependence of the dissipation rate is @xmath7 here ,",
    "@xmath8 is a function encapsulating all of the relativistic effects relevant for disk dynamics and the effect of the ( assumed ) inner boundary condition . in the newtonian limit for a keplerian potential",
    ", @xmath8 takes the familiar form : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the radius in the disk at which the stress is zero .",
    "@xmath11 is defined in the frame that comoves with the surfaces of the disk ( the  disk frame \" ) .",
    "determining the form of this function as measured by a distant observer requires a transformation into that observer s reference frame ( see  [ sec : distrib ] ) .",
    "although it does provide a context in which to understand many properties of a wide variety of accretion systems , this standard model is now known to have many limitations .",
    "one of these limitations lies at the heart of this paper : its assumption that stress , and therefore dissipation , end at the isco .",
    "this assumption is based on heuristic arguments , framed in a purely hydrodynamic context ( indeed * ? ? ?",
    "* point out that strong magnetic fields could undercut those arguments ) .",
    "now that we have strong reason to believe that turbulent magnetic fields are responsible for accretion @xcite , it is clear that dynamics near the isco must be considered more carefully in order to determine the true radiative efficiency @xcite . in a previous paper @xcite , we showed that the magnetic stresses are , in fact , quite strong at and inside the isco . in this paper",
    ", we examine the consequences for energy output . similarly borrowing terminology from @xcite ,",
    "we seek to locate the  radiation edge , \" the radius from within which little light emerges to reach the outside world .",
    "our approach rests on a number of fully general relativistic three dimensional mhd simulations of accretion onto black holes , reported in a series of papers beginning with @xcite .",
    "these simulations were focused primarily on dynamics and the torques generated by maxwell stresses within the accretion flow .",
    "because these simulations were unable to track dissipation directly , we must begin by developing a prescription to model the dissipation within the accretion flow .",
    "this prescription can then be used to predict the observed luminosity . to this end",
    ", we use the magnetic 4-current density as a proxy for local heating in a fashion similar to that proposed by @xcite and @xcite to determine where photons are generated , and then make use of a general relativistic ray - tracing package described previously by @xcite to follow the subsequent paths of those photons .",
    "the remainder of this paper is divided into four sections . in  [ sec : overview ] , we review the features of the simulations on which this work is based . in  [ sec : dissipation ] , we outline how the dissipation of gravitational potential energy within the flow may be described by use of the magnetic 4-current density and compare this quantity s radial profile to the dissipation profile expected from the standard relativistic disk model . in  [ sec : transform ] , we show how these dissipation functions can be transformed into radiation observed at large distance .",
    "to do so , we assume that all heat is radiated instantaneously and the photons encounter no opacity .",
    "this method is then applied in  [ sec : distrib ] to generate photon distribution functions and in  [ sec : effective ] to determine the observed radiation profile and the effective radiative efficiency of the flow . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : summ ] , we summarize our results and point the way to future work .",
    "the calculations presented here are based on the results of the keplerian disk ( kd ) simulations , which have been analyzed in a series of papers by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . for purposes of clarity",
    ", we present a brief summary of key aspects of these simulations .",
    "the equations of ideal non - radiative mhd are solved in the static kerr metric of a rotating black hole using boyer - lindquist coordinates expressed in gravitational units @xmath12 with line element @xmath13 and signature @xmath14 .",
    "the determinant of the @xmath15-metric is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the lapse function and @xmath18 is the determinant of the spatial @xmath19-metric .",
    "the finite difference algorithm used is described by @xcite .",
    "the initial conditions for the kd simulations consist of an isolated hydrostatic gas torus orbiting near the black hole , with the pressure maximum located at @xmath20 and a ( slightly ) sub - keplerian distribution of angular momentum throughout .",
    "the initial magnetic field is weak and purely poloidal , and follows isodensity surfaces within the torus .",
    "the mri , acting on this initial field , leads to large - amplitude mhd turbulence that drives the subsequent evolution of this torus . by the end of the simulation",
    "a quasi - steady state accretion disk extends from the hole out to @xmath21 . beyond this radius",
    "the net mass motion shifts to outward flow as it absorbs angular momentum from the inner disk . in this paper , therefore , we focus our attention on the region inside @xmath22 .    here",
    "we will make use of the data from the four high resolution simulations presented by @xcite , which are designated kd0 , kdi , kdp and kde and correspond to black hole spins of @xmath23 respectively .",
    "each simulation used @xmath24 @xmath25 grid zones .",
    "the radial grid extends from an inner boundary located at @xmath26 for kd0 , kdi , kdp , kde ( i.e. just outside the black hole event horizon in each case ) , to the outer boundary located at @xmath27 in all cases .",
    "the radial grid is graded according to a hyperbolic cosine function in order to concentrate grid zones close to the inner boundary .",
    "an outflow condition is applied at both the inner and outer radial boundary .",
    "the @xmath28-grid spans the range @xmath29 using an exponential distribution that concentrates zones near the equator .",
    "a reflecting boundary condition is used along the conical cutout surrounding the coordinate axis .",
    "finally , the @xmath30-grid spans the quarter plane , @xmath31 , with periodic boundary conditions in @xmath30 .",
    "the use of this restricted angular domain significantly reduces the computational requirements of the simulation ( for further discussion of the effects of this restriction see * ? ? ?",
    "each simulation was run to time @xmath32 , which corresponds to approximately @xmath33 orbits at the initial pressure maximum . for each simulation",

    "the state of the relativistic fluid at each point in spacetime is described by its density @xmath35 , specific internal energy @xmath36 , @xmath15-velocity @xmath37 , and isotropic pressure @xmath38 .",
    "the relativistic enthalpy is @xmath39 .",
    "the pressure is related to @xmath35 and @xmath36 via the equation of state for an ideal gas , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 .",
    "the magnetic field is described by two sets of variables .",
    "the first is the constrained transport magnetic field @xmath42 f_{jk}$ ] , where @xmath43 $ ] is the completely anti - symmetric symbol , and @xmath44 are the spatial components of the electromagnetic field strength tensor . from these",
    "are derived the magnetic field four - vector , @xmath45 , and the magnetic field scalar , @xmath46 .",
    "the electromagnetic component of the stress - energy tensor is @xmath47 as a stand - in for dissipation in the accretion flow .",
    "the behavior of @xmath48 in the kd simulations was examined previously by @xcite .",
    "the definition of the current is @xmath49 here @xmath50 is the covariant derivative and @xmath51 is the electromagnetic field strength tensor .",
    "the covariant derivative can be simplified by use of the anti - symmetry of @xmath51 , yielding : @xmath52 the current density scalar is then obtained simply from @xmath53 .",
    "evaluation of @xmath54 requires the computation of time - derivatives .",
    "since this information was not saved directly during the simulation itself , @xmath54 is obtained using data saved from three adjacent time steps .",
    "considerable effort is required to generate @xmath54 for an individual time - step within a simulation , so we limit our analysis in this initial investigation to a snapshot of the current density at @xmath55 , where all but the @xmath56 case have reached a quasi - steady state .",
    "in addition to the accretion disk , in all of these simulations unbound matter flows out in a cone aligned with the rotation axis .",
    "we have found it to be useful to distinguish this unbound material from the bound accretion flow .",
    "we designate as outflow any cell in which the specific energy @xmath57 ( signaling that it is unbound ) and @xmath58 . in this paper",
    "we focus exclusively on the `` bound '' material .",
    "determining the observational properties of an accretion disk model requires locating where it generates heat , that is , measuring  rather than assuming  the function @xmath59 . in a real disk , torques arise from the action of maxwell stresses ( and to a lesser extent reynolds stresses ) in the mhd turbulence generated by the mri .",
    "the energy thus extracted from the orbital motion is initially deposited into the kinetic and magnetic energy on the largest scales of the turbulence .",
    "subsequently , this energy cascades down to a dissipation scale ( either viscous or resistive ) where it is finally thermalized .",
    "the simulations describe well the first stages of this process , but can only mimic indirectly the last step : grid - level effects intervene at lengthscales far longer than the likely physical scale of dissipation .    in the present simulations @xmath11 can not therefore be directly determined .",
    "the simulations use a nonconservative internal energy equation , and much of the turbulent kinetic and magnetic energy is lost numerically on the grid scale , or partially captured through the use of an artificial viscosity .",
    "we therefore can not make rigorous arguments in support of any particular function of the dynamical data as a tracer of the local dissipation rate . at present",
    "we must instead look at simulation quantities that have the potential to trace the dissipation , making plausibility arguments that may lead us towards a good choice .    in doing",
    "so we have a powerful discriminant in the form of equation  ( [ eqn : ntdissprofile ] ) .",
    "so long as there is little global energy transport by waves , the classical azimuthally - averaged and vertically - integrated relationship between stress and dissipation still holds even for time - dependent disks @xcite .",
    "thus , equation  ( [ eqn : ntdissprofile ] ) should still apply in the main disk body if the instantaneous accretion rate is known , modulo a correction that accounts for any modification in the angular momentum flux due to magnetic stresses at and inside the isco @xcite .",
    "what we seek is more general : a measure of the dissipation rate that may be used in the plunging region as well as the disk body , and can be used in a sense that is local with respect to both position and time . to this end , we reinterpret equation  ( [ eqn : ntdissprofile ] ) as a constraint on any candidate prescription for dissipation : a successful proxy for dissipation must agree with it after azimuthal - averaging and vertical - integration in the region ( the main disk body ) where that equation is valid .",
    "our chosen proxy for tracing dissipation within the simulations is the current density , @xmath60 .",
    "a naive application of ohm s law ( power @xmath61 current@xmath62 ) partially motivates this choice .",
    "@xcite suggested that ( in the case of the solar corona ) , regions of high current density are _ candidates _ for regions of high magnetic dissipation ( and hence thermal heating ) , as high current density _ may _ trigger anomalous resistivity through mechanisms such as ion - acoustic turbulence , although it should be emphasized that no physical model ( in the context of accretion disks ) relating current density and dissipation is presently known .",
    "the connections between current and dissipation have also been examined in local mhd shearing box simulations .",
    "@xcite tracked dissipation explicitly and showed that dissipation within a gas pressure - dominated local shearing box is well correlated with the current density , but @xmath63 , not @xmath64 .",
    "( recall that the shearing box simulations are non - relativistic , and @xmath65 . ) in light of these results we have considered arbitrary powers of current , @xmath66 , and adjusted @xmath67 to provide a close match to the radial dependence of the standard @xmath11 in the disk body .",
    "we find that the choice @xmath60 is not only physically well - motivated , but also provides the best match to the slope of @xmath11 .",
    "it is entirely possible that prescriptions involving quantities other than the current density could serve as well or better as indicators of the dissipation rate .",
    "we have explored several candidates , chosen on the basis of their relation to energy flow within the disk ( the local magnetic work , @xmath68 , for example ) , but none passed our plausibility tests as well as the squared current - density .    to make the match with equation  [ eqn : ntdissprofile ] quantitatively , first recall that the dissipation rate , @xmath11 , is defined ( in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as the energy release per unit proper time per unit proper area as measured by an observer who co - rotates with the disk ( the  fluid frame \" )",
    ". however , the radiative efficiency of the accretion flow ( i.e. , the ratio of the integral of the dissipation rate to the rest mass energy of the accreted matter ) is defined as seen by a distant observer , at rest in the global boyer - lindquist coordinate frame . determining the radiative efficiency of the flow therefore requires transforming the dissipation rate from the fluid frame to the distant observer frame . for this reason",
    ", we compute the dissipation profiles in the distant observer frame , as this choice of frames provides the reader with the most direct link to the integrated radiative efficiency .",
    "our specific procedure is to assume that the dissipation is due to processes that act like a uniform resistivity ( note that the perfect mhd approximation on which the simulations were based assumes that there is perfect conductivity in the fluid frame ) . in the language of @xcite , the radiation contribution to the vertical energy flux @xmath69 at the top surface of the disk ( as seen in the coordinate frame ) may be written as @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the energy flux in the fluid frame . because @xmath71 is evaluated at the top surface of the disk , it is implicitly derived from an integral with respect to height of the local dissipation rate through the volume of the disk .",
    "we make the ansatz that the analog to @xmath71 in our situation ( in which the disk is not razor - thin ) is proportional to the squared current density integrated over @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath72 with this identification , the dissipation profile as a function of radius in the coordinate frame is @xmath73    when computing a radial dissipation profile we confine our attention to the disk - like material within the global flow , hence the use of the subscript  bound \" on the integral to denote that it includes only contributions from bound material within the accretion flow .",
    "this excludes the region identified as the `` funnel wall jet '' in previous studies @xcite .",
    "the analogous quantity for the standard model @xcite is : @xmath74 note that the factor @xmath75 in this last integral is determined from the @xmath76-d line element given in @xcite .    in this context",
    ", however , there is another standard of comparison for our dissipation prescription that is even more directly relevant .",
    "@xcite generalized the @xcite solution to allow for non - zero stress at @xmath4 .",
    "because magnetized accretion disks do have stresses in the marginally stable region @xcite , we also construct a @xmath77 for their solution in direct analogy with equation  ( [ eqn : qdissprof ] ) .",
    "the additional stress at @xmath4 can be parameterized in terms of the additional integrated dissipation in the disk @xmath78 .",
    "we call this generalized solution the  stressed standard model \" .    in figure",
    "[ fig : candchecks ] , we contrast three different versions of @xmath77 : the standard model ; the current prescription with a coefficient chosen so that this version matches the standard model at @xmath79 ; and a  stressed standard model \" whose additional stress is fixed by fitting to the current prescription after its normalization to the standard model . in the main disk body , where there is little difference between the standard model and the stressed standard model , we find that the current density tracer does a good job of matching both curves .",
    "as @xmath4 is approached from the outside , the @xmath77 predicted by the current density continues to fit well the stressed standard model for all four black hole spins . most strikingly , the dissipation profile predicted by the current varies smoothly across @xmath4 , in marked contrast to the predictions of either the standard or the stressed standard disk model .",
    "the former goes to zero at @xmath4 as a consequence of the zero - stress inner boundary condition ; the latter does the same because it is not defined at smaller radii .",
    "in addition , not only is @xmath77 continuous across @xmath4 , it is also continuous through the plunging region down to the inner boundary of the simulation .",
    "this behavior implies that , for a given black hole mass , spin , and accretion rate , the accretion flow is more efficient in dissipating energy within the flow than would be expected from the standard accretion disk model . we must remind the reader , however , that although the three lower - spin simulations had achieved a statistical steady - state by @xmath55 in the sense that their shell - integrated mass accretion rates varied very little with radius , it is clear from the radial fluctuations in these curves that a great many more samples would be necessary in order to achieve a good estimate of the time - average shell - integrated @xmath80 .

    "there is greater uncertainty in the efficiency due to our uncertainty in how much of the energy they carry reaches infinity .",
    "there are also two ways in which the numerical situation is different .",

    "<S> the total predicted dissipation rate is between @xmath0 and @xmath1 greater than that predicted by the standard model , depending on the black hole spin . </S>",
    "<S> most of the additional dissipation takes place just outside the isco . to predict luminosities , </S>",
    "<S> we assume instantaneous radiation and zero optical depth , but allow for photon capture . the net radiative efficiency seen by a distant observer </S>",
    "<S> is increased relative to the standard model by @xmath2@xmath3 , with the largest fractional increase for intermediate black hole spins because the increase in dissipation from enhanced stress that occurs for rapid spin is partially offset by the increased likelihood that the additional photons will be captured by the hole . </S>"
