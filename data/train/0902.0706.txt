    "a classical open problem in mathematical fluid mechanics is whether 3d euler equations may develop singularities in finite time @xcite .",
    "one of the scenarios proposed in the past for the formation of singularities in euler equations is the vortex patch problem .",
    "a vortex patch consist of a 2d simply connected and bounded region of constant vorticity which is a weak solution of the 2d euler equation .",
    "the work of chemin @xcite and bertozzi and constantin @xcite rigorously proved global existence of regular solutions for this case , and therefore in the context of this equation , singularities can not appear .",
    "a family of contour dynamics equations connect this scenario to the evolution of patches in the surface quasi - geostrophic equation .",
    "this problem , the @xmath0-patches problem , has been analysed in @xcite by crdoba _",
    "et al_. it is described by the equation , @xmath3 here the sum extends up to @xmath4 , the number of patches .",
    "this is a family of equations depending on the parameter @xmath0 . in the limit @xmath1 the equation approach the vortex patch problem of the 2d euler equation and the limit",
    "@xmath5 approaches the surface quasi - geostrophic equation .",
    "the later limit has been studied mathematically for more than a decade mainly because of its similarity to the 3d euler equations @xcite and because being a 2d model it is more tractable than the full 3d euler system .",
    "the solutions of the @xmath0-patches problem have been numerically explored in the range @xmath6 ( see the work by crdoba _",
    "@xcite ) and it has been reported evidence of self - similar collapse . in this article",
    "we provide a detailed description of the numerical method used there to perform those simulations and also explain how it is applied to the study of the system expressed in self - similar variables .",
    "the advantage of using rescaled variables is that the finite time collapse observed by crdoba _",
    "et al . _ , becomes an asymptotic limit in the pseudo - time @xmath7 , and thus the kind of evolution may be more accurately described .",
    "we have found a family of exact self - similar solutions to the rescaled system .",
    "numerically is found that these solutions act as geometrical separatrices of collapsing and non collapsing initial conditions .",
    "this article describes these findings as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the problem .",
    "in particular the equations under study are introduced and the derivation of the self - similar equations is explained .",
    "section 3 reports on the numerical methods employed in the simulations .",
    "section 4 accounts on the results .",
    "finally section 5 presents the conclusions .",
    "for the 2d vortex patch problem , the velocity of a particle on the contour of the patch is obtained , following zabusky et al .",
    "@xcite , by inverting the relation between the streamfunction and the vorticity . for the @xmath0-patches problem",
    "this relation is generalised by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the scalar and @xmath10 is the streamfunction . in the limit @xmath1 , which corresponds to the 2d euler equation",
    ", the scalar plays the role of vorticity and in the limit @xmath11 ( the quasi - geostrophic equation ) the scalar corresponds to the potential temperature . for @xmath12 one gets : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the position of points over the contour @xmath15 , parametrised with @xmath16 , and @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath18 is the value of scalar in the patch and the factor @xmath19 results from inverting the operator @xmath20 .",
    "the contour dynamics equation is then obtained by stating : @xmath21 in this article we will focus on the contour evolution of two patches for which the equation become : @xmath22 local existence for the limit @xmath23 has been reported in @xcite . in this case",
    "one should use ( see @xcite ) the following formula for the velocity ( in the one patch case ) : @xmath24 this equation eliminates the tangential component of the velocity , as only the normal component is able to deform the curve , and avoids therefore divergent integrals .",
    "simulations of eq .",
    "( [ eqvpws2 ] ) as reported in @xcite show evidence of self - similar collapse .",
    "the singularity is point - like and we denote the collapse coordinates as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the collapse time .",
    "numerical results of @xcite indicate that near the blowup there exist scaling laws in the evolution of the maximum curvature as @xmath27 and also in the minimum distance between contours @xmath28 we re - scale the spatial variable as @xmath29 where @xmath30 , and the velocity of the scaling function @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 the equation of motion for the rescaled space variable @xmath33 is : @xmath34 where @xmath35 are the rescaled contours .",
    "the new time variable @xmath36 transforms the equation ( [ resc ] ) into the self - similar equation : @xmath37 this equation , as the non - rescaled one , admits a projection over @xmath38 , the unitary normal component to the curve at @xmath33 , which is useful to describe the @xmath2 case , @xmath39 the projection evolves in time the same as the system ( [ resc1 ] ) as only the normal component deforms the curve . near the collapse time , rescaled contours reported in the work by crdoba et al .",
    "( see @xcite ) seem to coincide over a unique curve , thus suggesting that eq .",
    "( [ resc2 ] ) has a fixed point , also called self - similar solution .",
    "there exist interesting relations between the original and rescaled variables .",
    "for instance , the blowup in the original variables is transformed into an asymptotic behaviour in the self - similar variables . in this way the collapse reported in @xcite that takes place in a very small time interval in original variables ,",
    "is mapped to an infinite interval in rescaled variables , thus permitting a detailed monitoring of the blowup .",
    "we consider now the area of the patches .",
    "it is related to the energy of the initial data and it is conserved in the original variables @xmath40 , however following eq .",
    "( [ eq : varxesc ] ) , it tends to grow in the rescaled @xmath41 .",
    "other connections between the rescaled and non rescaled variables regard to distance .",
    "the shortest distance @xmath42 , between collapsing contours ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : d ] ) ) tends to zero in the original variables but it is not necessarily zero in the new variables .",
    "in fact in @xcite it is reported how the rescaled curves seem to keep a finite distance between them .",
    "these results are easily justified .",
    "since collapse is point - like , at the blowup time distance between contours becomes zero just for two trajectories , one on each contour , satisfying , @xmath43 distance between these trajectories in self - similar variables , is given by , @xmath44 the factor @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : col2trrees ] ) confirms that the null distance between the original variables is satisfied even if trajectories on the rescaled variables are at a finite distance at the collapse time @xmath26 .",
    "the above expression may be rewritten in terms of the pseudo - time @xmath7 as follows , @xmath46 as explained in next section , the numerical technique used for simulations does not track individual particles on contours , but just the contour as a whole , so that the above collapse trajectories are not numerically integrated .",
    "however it is expected that near the collapse , the distance between these trajectories will be well represented by the evolution of the shortest distance between contours for which in @xcite it is reported @xmath47 here @xmath48 represents the set of points on the contours that are at a shortest distance , as a function of time . similarly in the self - similar variables the collapse may be tracked by means of the shortest distance between contours , @xmath49 this expression indicates that existence of collapse in the self - similar variables , implies that the minimum distance between contours defined as : @xmath50 is a positive function , @xmath51 , satisfying : @xmath52 otherwise the initial patches would be non collapsing .",
    "in other words , non collapsing patches , in the original variables remain always with finite curvature and at a finite distance at any time , but in the self - similar variables its minimum distance asymptotically goes at least as @xmath53 , so that they are repelled one from other .",
    "typically the time evolution of non collapsing initial data is not described in the self - similar variables framework , however this is done in this article guided by the exact self - similar solutions of the system ( [ resc1 ] ) , for which numerics shows evidence that they constitute a boundary between collapsing and non collapsing data .",
    "we will come to these issues in detail in the results section .",
    "the existence of a @xmath7 dependent function @xmath51 , is consistent with the collapse classifications in terms of self - similar variables reported in @xcite .",
    "there it is shown that the asymptotic behaviour of the collapsing data may be towards a fixed point ( a constant @xmath51 ) or towards @xmath7-dependent solutions which may be either periodic or chaotic . in this article",
    "we will show that numerical simulations indicate that the collapse of the @xmath0-patches problem address an asymptotic chaotic regime , suggesting that this could be the type of collapse present in the 3d euler problem as conjectured in @xcite .",
    "we have numerically solved eq .",
    "( [ eqvpws2 ] ) for @xmath12 .",
    "the evolution is calculated using ideas developed in @xcite for the case of the 2d euler equations .",
    "in particular , as described in @xcite , each contour @xmath54 is represented by a set of nodes @xmath55 .",
    "1 depicts a scheme showing how the curve is interpolated between consecutive nodes with a cubic spline , as follows : @xmath56 for @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 , where : @xmath60 the cubic interpolation coefficients @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are : @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the local curvature defined by a circle through the three points , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 .     by a set of @xmath55 points .",
    "the solid line represents the interpolating curve between nodes @xmath70 and @xmath71 . ]",
    "the node spacing in each contour is non - locally adjusted at each time step depending on curvature .",
    "issues related to the density of nodes along the curve will be addressed later . now it is explained how the system ( [ eqvpws2 ] ) is transformed by the above discretisation .",
    "the evolution of any point @xmath72 on the contours is replaced by the evolution of a point @xmath73 on the discrete curves , and the integrals on the contour curves @xmath54 are replaced by the summation of integrals over the parameter @xmath74 : @xmath75 here @xmath76 refers to a piece of curve computed as in eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) at a time @xmath77 , and the additional subindex @xmath78 distinguishes the contour where the segment is placed . more abstractly this expression may be written as : @xmath79 this equation stands for any node @xmath73 on the discretised contour curves so , for the case of two contours on a plane , the system ( [ eqvpws2d ] ) represents a set of @xmath80 coupled ordinary differential equations , which more compactly is rewritten as an autonomous system as follows : @xmath81 the dimension @xmath82 of the system ( [ aut ] ) is very large and typically non constant , as the discretisation does not force to maintain the number of points @xmath55 on the curve for all times .",
    "following @xcite the system ( [ aut ] ) is integrated with an explicit 4@xmath83 order runge - kutta method .",
    "the time step @xmath84 in the runge - kutta method as suggested by crdoba et al .",
    "@xcite is chosen dynamically , since near the collapse time it has to be refined . as it is reported there",
    ", the blowup concurs with the formation of corners on the contours , and the node spacing @xmath85 is reduced to represent corners properly .",
    "the time step is then adjusted as @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is empirically tuned for different values of @xmath0 .    in the numerical simulation of the @xmath0-patches problem",
    "the most challenging part is the evaluation of each @xmath88 in eq .",
    "( [ compaut ] ) as required by the runge - kutta method at each time step .",

    "8b ) the configuration is : one patch is contained in region ( l ) , while the other overlaps regions (",
    "l ) , ( d ) and ( r ) . in both cases",
    "the minimum distance between patches evolves according to the collapse condition ( [ eq : col6tr ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath190 is depicted in fig 6 .",
    "the solid black line stands for the initial data of figure 8a ) while the solid gray line corresponds to the initial data in figure 8b ) .",
    "both regimes stay below the line which mark the limit for non collapsing initial data .",
    "simulation are performed for a @xmath7 interval in which the area of the patches increases 4 orders of magnitude .",
    "figure 7 shows a magnification of the evolution of @xmath190 for the initial data in fig .",
    "it is clear the rapidly oscillating behaviour that does not settle in a stationary regime as would be the case of an attracting fixed point .",
    "the black line corresponds to the evolution of the minimum distance with resolution @xmath191 , the gray line corresponds to a higher resolution ( @xmath192 ) . in the latter case the amplitude of the oscillations diminishes , but still confirms a `` chaotic '' evolution of the distance .",
    "it seems that these oscillations are under - resolved in both discretisations , and there is a noticeable sensitivity in the evolution to the dimension of the discrete system ( [ aut ] ) which is different in both cases .",
    "this confirms the conjecture of a `` chaotic '' evolution embedded in an infinity dimension dynamical system .",
    "9 shows another collapsing data distributed like in fig .",
    "however in this case the non collapse configuration discussed in fig .",
    "5 ( _ i.e. _ each patch is entirely contained in opposite domains ) is only slightly violated .",
    "numerically is found that the evolution of the distance between contours follows an exponential law as the initial data of fig .",
    "however now the gradient obtained from the linear fitting @xmath7 vs @xmath193 is @xmath194 .",
    "this is almost equal to @xmath132 , however it does not satisfy the non collapse requirement @xmath182 , and thus the initial condition provides an example of a slowly collapsing data .",
    "we have studied the @xmath0-patches problem in self - similar variables and we have found a family of exact self - similar fixed points for these equations .",
    "these are valid for the whole parameter range @xmath169 which encompasses the surface quasi - geostrophic equation . for the @xmath170 case",
    "intensive numerical simulations are performed .",
    "they indicate that the stationary solution organises the evolution of different initial data , since it acts as a separatrix of collapsing and non collapsing conditions . it is found a perturbation to this solution that completely fall in its unstable subspace .",
    "these are repelling patches that separate exponentially at a rate @xmath182 thus confirming the non collapse requirement ( [ eq : col6tr ] ) .",
    "the @xmath7 evolution of other initial conditions is also discussed .",
    "there are found collapsing solutions for initial configurations that cross the boundaries marked by the fixed point ( [ eq : selfsimsol ] ) .",
    "it seems that some of these data do not reach a stationary regime but a `` chaotic '' one .",
    "also initial conditions that slowly collapse are reported .",
