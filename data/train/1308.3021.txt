    "models with chiral fourth generation fermions ( sm4 ) are well - motivated extensions of the standard model ( sm ) , and have been studied extensively in the literature ( for reviews , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the condition for @xmath3 symmetry violation in the sm only requires the existence of at least three generations of chiral fermions  @xcite .",
    "there is however no upper limit on the number of generations from the first principle . in the sm ,",
    "the amount of @xmath3 violation is not large enough to explain the baryon - antibaryon asymmetry in the universe .",
    "the sm also fails to provide a valid dark matter ( dm ) candidate . in some non - minimal models of sm4 , extra left- and right - hand neutrinos",
    "are introduced , these neutrinos can be detectable dark matter particles . with massive quarks in the fourth generation",
    ", it has been proposed that the electroweak symmetry breaking can be a dynamical feature of the sm  @xcite .",
    "the simplest version of sm4 contains a sequential fourth generation of fermions .",
    "the fourth neutrino can be either dirac or majorana .",
    "this simple model is already stringently constrained by various experiments .",
    "the current lower bound on the mass of the unstable fourth generation charged lepton @xmath4 is @xmath5 gev from the search for the decay @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the fourth neutrino  @xcite .",
    "the lep - ii data have shown that the number of light active neutrinos is three . from the invisible width of @xmath8 boson ,",
    "the lower bound for the mass of an unstable dirac neutrino is set to be @xmath9 gev from the decay @xmath10 .",
    "the lower bound for a stable dirac ( majorana ) neutrino is roughly half of the @xmath8 boson mass , i.e. , @xmath11 gev  @xcite .",
    "direct searches for fourth generation quarks at the tevatron and the lhc can push the lower limits on the masses of the fourth generation quarks close to the non - perturbative region , which however depends strongly on assumptions .",
    "for instance , the searches for the fourth down - type quarks @xmath12 pair - production set a lower limit of @xmath13 gev by cms  @xcite and @xmath14 gev by atlas  @xcite , assuming @xmath15 ; through searching for the single production @xmath16 , the limit is found to be @xmath17 gev ( assuming @xmath18 ) or @xmath19 gev ( assuming @xmath20 ) by d0  @xcite ; through searching for the fourth up - type quark @xmath21 pair - production , assuming subsequent decay @xmath22 , the obtained bound is @xmath23 gev by cms  @xcite and @xmath24 gev by atlas  @xcite .",
    "the mass splittings between up- and down - type fermions , such as @xmath25 and @xmath26 are constrained to be small by the observables of the electroweak precision test , such as the oblique parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28  @xcite .    in the sm4 ,",
    "the fourth fermions have large yukawa couplings to the higgs boson , which leads to significant modifications to the predictions for the loop - induced processes such as gluon fusion @xmath29 and the decay @xmath30 .",
    "thus the searches for higgs boson production and decays can place stringent constraints on the parameter space of sm4 , as the current experimental results are consistent with a sm - like higgs boson within errors . the cross - section for higgs boson production through @xmath29 is enhanced compared with that in the sm  @xcite .",
    "one thus expects significant enhancements of the event rates of @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , etc .",
    ", which is not confirmed by the current data . on the other hand , the partial decay width of @xmath30",
    "is suppressed in the sm4 , due to the destructive interference between the @xmath33-loop and @xmath34-loop .",
    "such a cancellation makes the prediction sensitive to the next leading order ( nlo ) electroweak corrections proportional to @xmath35 .",
    "the recent calculations show that when the nlo electroweak corrections are included , for heavy fourth quarks around @xmath36 gev , the partial decay width @xmath37 is only @xmath38 of that in the sm  @xcite , which makes the event rate of @xmath39 far below the sm value and almost undetectable at lhc .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the sm4 in which the fourth generation fermions and the sm fermions have different symmetry properties , such that the transitions to the first three generation fermions are forbidden  @xcite .",
    "we show that in this scenario the above mentioned tensions can be relaxed : i ) the current direct search lower bounds are no longer valid as the fourth quarks can not decay into the sm ones , allowing for relatively light fourth quarks .",
    "ii ) for relatively light fourth generation quarks around 200 gev the destructive interference between the fourth generation quark loops and the @xmath33-loop in the decay @xmath30 at nlo is reduced by an order of magnitude compared with @xmath40 gev fourth quarks , which relaxes the corresponding constraint .",
    "iii ) due to the protection of the symmetry , the lightest fourth neutrino can be a stable majorana particle which can be as light as 40 gev without violating the lep - ii bounds .",
    "such a light stable neutrino can trigger the higgs invisible decay through @xmath41 , which enhances the total width of the higgs boson and relaxes the constraints from the measurements of @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , etc .",
    "furthermore , the stable fourth neutrino can be a subdominant dm component which can be detected by the dm direct detection experiments . through a global @xmath42 analysis of the current lhc data on the higgs production and decays , we obtain the allowed range of the fourth majorana neutrino mass and the mixing angle between the left - hand neutrino and right - hand anti - neutrino .",
    "we find that the prediction for the recoil event rate is within the reach of the up coming direct detection experiments such as xenon1 t .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "a brief introduction of sm4 with additional symmetries is given in section ii . in section iii , we study the phenomenology of the higgs production and decays with focus on the invisible decay mode and compare the predictions with the experimental data of atlas and cms through a global fit to the data . in section iv",
    ", we study the stable fourth - generation majorana neutrino as the dark matter candidate for its contribution to the dm relic density and predictions for the dm direct detection .",
    "finally , a conclusion is given in section v.",
    "we begin with a brief overview of the sm4 . in this type of model the sm is extended with an additional sequential fermion generation including a right - hand fourth neutrino .",
    "@xmath43 the fourth generation neutrinos can have both dirac and majorana mass terms . in the basis of @xmath44 , the mass matrix for the fourth neutrino",
    "is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the dirac and majorana masses , respectively .",

    "the value of @xmath49 is defined in the range @xmath53 and is determined by @xmath54 with @xmath55 corresponding to the limit of minimal ( maximal ) mixing .",
    "the phase @xmath56 in the expression of @xmath57 is introduced to render the two mass eigenvalues real and positive .",
    "the two majorana mass eigenstates are @xmath58 .",
    "the masses of the two neutrinos are given by @xmath59 . in terms of the mixing angle @xmath49 ,",
    "they can be rewritten as @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "note that for all the possible values of @xmath49 the lighter neutrino mass eigenstate @xmath62 consists of more left - hand component than the right - hand one , which means that @xmath62 always has sizable coupling to the sm @xmath8-boson .",
    "therefore the lep - ii bound on the mass of stable neutrino is always valid for @xmath62 , which is insensitive to the mixing angle .    in the mass basis",

    "the lighter fourth neutrino @xmath69 can be stable as a dark matter particle .",
    "this can be realized by introducing additional symmetries to the sm4 , for instance :    * an @xmath70 @xmath71 symmetry under which the fourth generation fermions are odd and the sm fermions are even . in some models ,",
    "the @xmath72 symmetry can be connected with the discrete @xmath73 and @xmath3 symmetries of quantum fields  @xcite .",
    "note that a discrete symmetry without gauge origin may be eventually broken by the effects of quantum gravity at planck scale  @xcite . *",
    "another possibility is to introduce a new @xmath74 gauge symmetry .",
    "all the fermions in sm4 are vector - like in the new gauge interaction . through appropriately arranging the @xmath74 charges of the fermions , the gauge anomaly can be canceled out among the generations  @xcite . * in the sm , the local symmetry of @xmath75 which is the difference between baryon number @xmath76 and lepton number @xmath77 and the hypercharge @xmath78 are know to be anomaly free for each generation . thus one can assign a non - zero @xmath79 charge to the fourth generation fermions , where @xmath80 is a mixing parameter . for @xmath81 case , the sm higgs boson can give masses to all the fermions .",
    "for @xmath82 case , additional higgs boson has to be introduced to generate the masses of the fourth fermions  @xcite .    in models with additional @xmath74 gauge symmetry",
    ", new gauge boson @xmath83 appears inevitably .",
    "the mass of @xmath83 and its coupling to sm fermions as well as the mixing with @xmath8 boson are constrained by various experiments ( for a review , see  @xcite ) . in this work",
    ", we assume that the @xmath83 boson is heavy enough , such that the current limits on @xmath83 boson can be avoided , the fourth neutrino main interact with sm fermions though @xmath8 and @xmath84 .",
    "according to the theory of qcd , the quarks and gluons are the fundamental degrees of freedom to participate in strong interactions at high energy .",
    "the qcd parton model plays a pivotal role in understanding hadron collisions . due to the gluon luminosity",

    "in summary , we have considered a type of extensions of the simplest sm4 , in which extra symmetries are introduced to prevent the transitions of the fourth generation fermions to the ones in the first three generations . in these models ,",
    "the lower bounds on the masses of fourth generation quarks from direct searches can be relaxed , and at the same time the fourth neutrino is allowed to be stable and light enough to trigger the higgs boson invisible decay . in addition , the fourth majorana neutrino becomes a detectable dark matter particle .",
    "we have performed a global analysis of the current lhc data on the higgs boson production and decays in this type of sm4 .",
    "the results show that the mass of the fourth majorana neutrino is confined in the range @xmath0 gev at 95% c.l .. within the allowed parameter space , we have found that the predicted effective cross - section for spin - independent dm - nucleus scattering is @xmath1 , which is insensitive to the mixing angle between the left- and right - hand component of the majorana neutrino , and can be tested by the xenon1 t experiment in the near future .",
