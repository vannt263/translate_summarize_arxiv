    "let @xmath0 be a riemannian manifold .",
    "we define the path space @xmath1 over @xmath0 to be @xmath2 , m).$ ] the manifold structure on path space has been explored in  @xcite[chapter 10 ] @xcite [ theorem 10.4 ] .",
    "we do not address the issue of manifold structure on @xmath1 .",
    "this paper mainly concerns with the geodesics on the path space over a riemannian manifold and a double category defined by the geodesics on @xmath1 .",
    "section  [ s : vectcon ] is expository , we mostly review known results to set up our terminologies and notations . in fact , a discussion with a more general framework is available in   @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we introduce an @xmath3 metric  @xcite given by @xmath4 on the path space , where @xmath5 is a metric on manifold @xmath6 @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( naturally identified with vector fields along @xmath9 ) .",
    "a covariant connection on @xmath1 is defined by point - wise evaluation of a covariant connection on @xmath0 .",
    "it follows that on the path space , a geodesic is uniquely determined by specifying a path @xmath7 and a vector field along @xmath9 .",
    "proposition  [ prop : completeness ] [ corollary a.4 , @xcite ] shows if ambient space @xmath0 is complete with respect to a riemannian connection , then the path space @xmath1 is also complete with respect to the corresponding induced connection on the path space .",
    "we also discussed the exponential map on the path space .    in section  [ s : metric ] we introduce a distance function on @xmath1 .",
    "a consequence of the construction in section  [ s : vectcon ] is that the exponential map @xmath10 on @xmath1 is given by @xmath11,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the exponential map on @xmath0 and other notations have obvious meaning .",
    "thus , the normal neighbourhood on @xmath1 is as described in proposition  [ prop : existencenormalne ] . in theorem  [ theo : normalneighbour ]",
    "we prove that any @xmath13 can be joined by a unique minimizing geodesic and @xmath14 is convex ( with respect to the distance function on @xmath1 ) , where @xmath14 is a normal neighbourhood around @xmath15 .",
    "a prominent direction of enquiry in the area of parallel transport on path spaces has been in terms of higher categories ; works in this direction include @xcite and many others .",
    "for instance , in  @xcite a connection has been defined on the principal bundle over the path space , then it has been shown that horizontal lifting of paths on the path space result in a double category .",
    "the intuitive reason behind appearence of higher categories in this context is as follows .",
    "since a path on the path space @xmath16\\rightarrow { { \\mathcal p}m}$ ] is essentially a `` surface '' @xmath17\\times [ c , d]\\rightarrow m\\nonumber\\\\ & & ( s , t)\\mapsto \\gamma(s , t)\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on @xmath0 , we can talk about `` transverse '' paths @xmath18\\rightarrow m$ ] and `` longitudinal '' paths @xmath19\\rightarrow m$ ] .",
    "then we may consider `` sideways '' composition and `` top - bottom '' composition for such `` surfaces '' .",
    "on the other hand the essential idea of a double category @xmath20 over a category @xmath21 is , objects of @xmath20 are morphisms ( @xmath22-morphisms ) of @xmath21 and morphisms ( @xmath23-morphisms ) in @xmath20 are equipped with two types of composition laws ( namely , `` horizontal '' and `` vertical '' ) .",
    "so , if we take into account that two elements of @xmath1 might be composable as paths on @xmath0 , then it indicates that compositions of such ` surfaces ' ( given as paths on a path space ) correspond to compositions of @xmath23-morphisms in a higher category . in section  [",
    "s : double ] we show that if @xmath0 is complete then the geodesics on path space @xmath1 induces a double category structure . here ,",
    "basically a @xmath24-morphism ( object ) consists of a triplet , a point in @xmath6 a tangent vector and an element of @xmath25 . whereas a @xmath22-morphism is a triplet , given by a path on @xmath6 a tangent vector along the path and an element of @xmath25 .",
    "finally , a @xmath23-morphism is specified by a geodesic on the path space and an open interval in @xmath25 .",
    "before we could make these ideas mathematically precise , we need to settle few technical difficulties .",
    "that has been done in section  [ s : double ] .",
    "we use the technique of `` _ back - track equivalence _ '' , which ensures that the equivalent set of back - track equivalent paths on @xmath0 can be treated as a morphism in a category , whose object space is @xmath0 .",
    "so , in section  [ s : double ] we first discuss the notion of back - track equivalence and construct a category @xmath26 , whose object set is @xmath0 and morphisms are ( back - track equivalent ) paths on @xmath0 .",
    "we show in proposition  [ pr : equiva ] that geodesics on @xmath1 preserves the back - track equivalence identification on @xmath1 .",
    "theorem  [ th : double ] proves the existence of a double category , whose base category is defined by @xmath26 ( with some additional factors ) .",
    "we end this paper with a physical interpretation of the categories obtained in section  [ s : double ] . in particular , we show that the morphisms of double category in theorem  [ th : double ] can be interpreted as the world sheets generated by free strings ( without any external force ) on the riemannian manifold @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a riemannian manifold .",
    "we define path space @xmath1 as the space of all smooth maps @xmath27\\rightarrow m$ ] defined on an open interval @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "we denote the evaluation map as @xmath29 , @xmath30\\label{eva}.\\ ] ] for a @xmath31 we get a tangent vector at @xmath9 to be the differential of the map @xmath32 @xmath33\\to tm,\\text {   }   \\text{smooth vector field along } \\gamma \\}.\\ ] ]    let @xmath5 be a metric on the manifold @xmath0 .",
    "it defines an @xmath34 metric @xmath35 on @xmath1  @xcite given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 are vector fields on @xmath1 .",
    "much of the content of this section could be found in  @xcite .",
    "we will briefly recall some results for our purpose .",
    "let @xmath38 be a covariant connection on @xmath0 . then define a connection on @xmath1 by point - wise evaluation : @xmath39 where @xmath40 are vector fields on @xmath41 thus we have the following proposition :    [ prop : metriccompati ] if metric @xmath5 is compatible with the connection @xmath38 on @xmath0 , then so is metric @xmath42 with @xmath43 on @xmath1 .",
    "the proof follows by verifying the famous `` six terms '' formula ( theorem 2.2 and proposition 2.3 , chapter - iv @xcite ) @xmath44,z)+{\\widetilde g}([z , x],y)+{\\widetilde g}(x,[z , y]),\\label{covpath}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 are vector fields on @xmath1 and @xmath46 is the contraction .",

    "in string theory we may consider a string to be an oriented arc on some ( riemannian ) manifold @xmath0 , given by @xmath27\\rightarrow m.$ ] string interactions are described by combining two strings to form a third string ( see figure 1 ) , and the combining process can be either via _ end - to - end _ interaction or _",

    "thus , @xmath323 can be interpreted as a string @xmath9 moving with a velocity @xmath324 at time @xmath325 the category @xmath319 is slightly more restrictive than category @xmath26 ; by two morphisms in @xmath319 are composable when the respective strings are composable in @xmath26 and their end points move with the same velocity at a particular instant of time ; thus by composition in they form a third string moving in a new velocity given by .",
    "we will call the two strings _ interactive _ when they are composable in @xmath26 ( i.e. starting - end points coincide ) and also they have same velocity at the joining points at any particular time .",
    "let us now consider the category @xmath322 .",

    "the composition @xmath320 in implies that the worldsheet generated by the free moving string @xmath9 between interval @xmath326 and @xmath329 can be decomposed into the worldsheets generated between the intervals @xmath330 and @xmath331 for some @xmath332 in other words , we can slice a worldsheet into worldsheets generated between the intermediate time intervals . on the other hand the partial product or horizontal composition @xmath311 in",
    "has following interpretation .",
    "suppose @xmath333 @xmath125 are interactive ( as defined in the last paragraph ) at time @xmath326 .",
    "then they also remain interactive at any future instant of time @xmath327 .",
    "moreover , if we consider the third string , say @xmath334 , formed by the interaction of @xmath124 , @xmath125 at a time @xmath326 and the world sheet generated by @xmath334 between time @xmath330 , then it is same as  side ways composition \" of two world sheets created by @xmath124 and @xmath125 between time @xmath335",
