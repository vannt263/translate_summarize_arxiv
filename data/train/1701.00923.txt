    "the experimental evidences for polarization of hyperons in heavy - ion collisions found by star collaboration @xcite attracted recently much attention @xcite .    the studies of polarization are often performed @xcite in the framework of approach exploring local equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite and hydrodynamical calculations of vorticity @xcite .",
    "there is another approach to polarization first proposed in @xcite and independently in @xcite .",
    "the so - called axial vortical effect ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) being the macroscopic manifestation of axial anomaly @xciteleads to induced axial current of strange quarks which may be converted to polarization of @xmath0-hyperons @xcite .",
    "the effect is proportional to vorticity and helicity of the strong interacting medium which was calculated @xcite in the kinetic quark - gluon - string model(qgsm)@xcite . in this way , in fact ,",
    "some particular case of fundamental relation between kinetic and hydrodynamic description was considered .",
    "this calculation were later made more detailed@xcite , including the spatial and temporal dependence of strange chemical potential which is also the ingredient of anomalous approach to polarization .",
    "anomalous mechanism of polarization makes this effect qualitatively similar to the local violation @xcite of discrete symmetries in strongly interacting qcd matter .",
    "the most well known here is the chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) which uses the ( c)p - violating ( electro)magnetic field emerging in heavy ion collisions in order to probe the ( c)p - odd effects in qcd matter .",
    "the polarization , in turn , is similar to chiral vortical effect ( cve)@xcite due to coupling to p - odd medium vorticity leading to the induced electromagnetic and all conserved - charge currents @xcite , in particular the baryonic one .",
    "recently the pioneering preliminary results on global polarization of @xmath0 and @xmath2 hyperons in @xmath1 collisions in beam energy scan at rhic were released @xcite and the qualitative tendency of polarization decrease with energy in agreement with the prediction @xcite was revealed . the recent theoretical analysis @xcite suggested that decrease of polarization with energy is related to the suppression of axial magnetic effect contribution in strongly correlated qcd matter found in lattice simulations .",
    "indeed , the chiral vorticity coefficient describing the axial vortical effect @xmath3 contains temperature dependent term related to gravitational anomaly @xcite , and naively it can be quite substantial and increase with energy . however , lattice simulations @xcite lead to the zero result in the confined phase and to the suppression by one order of magnitude at high temperatures .",
    "neglecting axial chemical potential , the coefficient @xmath4 takes the form @xmath5    as soon as for free fermion gas the @xmath6 term is recovered @xcite for large lattice volume at fixed temperature , the above - mentioned suppression should be attributed to the correlation effects .",
    "it was suggested@xcite , that the accurate measurements of polarization energy dependence may serve a sensitive probe of strongly correlated qcd matter . in the current paper",
    "we perform numerical simulations to implement this suggestion .",
    "we performed the numerical simulations in qgsm model @xcite .",
    "we decomposed the space - time to the cells , allowing to define velocity and vorticity in the kinetic model , as described in detail in @xcite . to define the strange chemical potential ( assuming that @xmath0 polarization is carried by strange quark ) we used the matching procedure @xcite of distribution functions to its ( local ) equilibrium values",
    ". in this paper",
    ", we also determine in this way the values of temperature .",
    "in general , let us stress that we realized in our particular case the relation between kinetics , hydrodynamics and thermodynamics .",
    "we first neglect the gravitational anomaly contribution and start by considering the energy dependence of polarization ( described in detail in @xcite ) for three values of impact parameter .",
    "the results are presented at fig.1 .",
    "the curves correspond to @xmath7 .",
    "we continue by the inclusion of contribution related to gravitational anomaly , which is the central issue of this paper .",
    "the results are presented at fig.2 .",
    "we consider as a starting point the original value of anomaly coefficient@xcite @xmath6 which is reproduced for large lattice volume at fixed temperature@xcite .",
    "we present the curves following from the coefficients suppressed by factor @xmath8 ( [ cvl ] ) resulting from the lattice calculations @xcite .",
    "we compare values of @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "as one can see , the lattice - supported value @xmath11 is most close to the behavior of preliminary data which may be considered as a signal of strongly correlated matter formation .",
    "the closeness of @xmath12 curve to the experimental points may be related to the contribution of confinement phase , where lattice calculations @xcite lead to zero temperature - dependent effect . at the same time ,",
    "already @xmath13 leads to the curve growing with energy , while @xmath9 leads to extremely strong growth .",
    "we numerically studied the generation of polarization by the anomalous mechanism ( axial vortical effect ) and compared it with the preliminary observed data .",
    "first we neglected the gravitational anomaly related temperature dependent contribution when the decrease of chemical potential with energy leads in turn to the decrease of polarization .",
    "we considered this effect for three impact parameters .",
    "we also included the contribution related to gravitational anomaly proportional to @xmath14 and studied its possible suppression in strongly correlated matter .",
    "we found that the preliminary data are in accordance with suppression effect found on the lattice .",
