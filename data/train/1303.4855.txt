    "dipolar glass ( dg ) model @xcite was developed in the late 1990s in response to the urgent need to explain the ubiquitous poole - frenkel ( pf ) mobility field dependence observed in amorphous polymers ( polyvinylcarbazole @xcite , polysilenes @xcite and others ) , molecularly doped polymers @xcite , and low molecular weight organic glasses @xcite in a broad field range .",
    "this model overcomes the limitations of the gaussian disorder model ( gdm ) @xcite , which successfully explained the mobility temperature dependence , but failed to reproduce the mobility field dependence for small and moderate electric fields .",
    "the dg model is a natural evolution of the earlier approach of borsenberger and bassler @xcite , who suggested dipolar energetic disorder as an explanation of strong polarity effect on the hopping charge mobility in amorphous organic materials .",
    "they considered the dipolar as well van der waals energetic disorder , but did not introduce them consistently on a microscopic level .",
    "it turned out that strong spatial correlations in the random energy landscape , intrinsic to dipolar disorder , move transport properties of polar materials far away from those of the gdm .",
    "in particular , spatial correlations naturally provide a strong physical foundation for the development of the pf mobility field dependence @xcite .",
    "previous monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite have shown that the time of flight ( tof ) currents , predicted by the dg model , provide transients having typical features of the experimental ones : an initial short spike , reflecting a non - equilibrium stage of the carrier transport , followed by a flat plateau signaling partial equilibration of carriers , and then an anomalously long tail described by a power law @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "all earlier models failed to predict these broad post flight current tails in combination with almost flat plateau for the case of strong disorder .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to investigate in detail the tof currents , predicted by the dg model for a prototype molecularly doped polymer 30% deh : pc ( polycarbonate doped with 30 wt.% of aromatic hydrazone deh ) .",
    "we consider charge transport in a cubic lattice of randomly oriented static dipoles with the dipole moment @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the fraction of sites serving as hopping centers ( transport sites ) .",
    "the random energy of a particular transport site is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the electrostatic potential , created by all other dipoles .",
    "if @xmath5 is not too low , then the density of states has a gaussian form and correlation function @xmath8 decays as @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "if electric field @xmath10 is applied , then the random energy has an additional term @xmath11 .",
    "the dg model is also known as a correlated disorder model ( cdm ) @xcite , but the present name is better suited for description of the true nature of the model ; for example , it explicitly assumes a particular spatial decay of the correlation function @xmath12 , while the name `` cdm '' is too ambiguous in this respect .",
    "indeed , the model of the quadrupolar glass , where randomly oriented quadrupoles fill the lattice instead of dipoles , provides a correlated energy landscape as well , so it again can be dubbed a correlated disorder model , but the correlation function in the quadrupolar case is different , @xmath13 @xcite , and , hence , the transport properties are different as well @xcite .",
    "the miller - abrahams hopping rate was used for the simulations , where the rate of transition from site @xmath14 to site @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the prefactor frequency , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is a wave function decay parameter for transport sites .",
    "monte carlo simulations refer to the traditional tof experiment when a sheet of carriers ( holes in the case of deh : pc polymer ) is instantly produced at the generating electrode at @xmath20 and then drifts towards the collecting electrode located at @xmath21 ( hence , @xmath22 is a thickness of the transport layer ) .",
    "the output of the simulation is the mean velocity @xmath23 of a carrier ; the major experimental observable , current density @xmath24 , is proportional to @xmath23 .",
    "another important parameter is the mean carrier velocity @xmath25 for a full transfer from the generating to collecting electrode .",
    "this velocity is equal to @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the time for a carrier to drift from @xmath28 to @xmath29 .",
    "other details of the simulation can be found elsewhere @xcite .    in the simulation we tried to model the polycarbonate doped with 30 wt.% of aromatic hydrazone deh .",
    "dg model parameters ( borrowed from the analysis of experimental data in ref .",
    "@xcite ) are as follows : the rms dipolar disorder @xmath30 is 0.13 ev and contains no additional contributions ( e.g. , van der waals ) , the lattice constant @xmath31 nm , @xmath32 , @xmath33 ev ( room temperature ) , and @xmath34 .    in all figures ( apart from )",
    "we use a dimensionless time @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the physical time .",

    "the calculated mobility field dependence begins to deviate from ( [ pf ] ) , reflecting the particular property of the miller - abrahams hopping rate @xcite .",
    ".field dependence of transit times for @xmath39 lattice planes.[table1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     thus , three main results of the previous simulations ( fast establishment of the quasi - stationary transport regime as evidenced by the flat plateau , the power law decay of the tail of the transients , and pf mobility field dependence ) have been confirmed .",

    "electric field is 200 v/@xmath1m.[fig6],width=288 ]    a new observation concerns the carrier equilibration time @xmath69 , which is easily seen in at large electric fields but seems rather difficult to quantify as the non - equilibrium stage merges smoothly into the equilibrium one .",
    "to clarify this situation we present  showing tof transients at extreme fields ( 5 and 200 v/@xmath1 m , respectively ) for varying thickness @xmath22 .",
    "equilibration time @xmath69 can be estimated as the time of an intersection of the tangents to the initial non - equilibrium part of the transient and the plateau .",
    "the use of this procedure gives the equilibration time @xmath70 for the highest field of 200 v/@xmath1 m , while for the smallest field ( 5 v/@xmath1 m ) it is much larger and equal to @xmath71 .",
    "the observed variation of @xmath69 is even larger than that of the carrier mobility : the former rises by a factor of 80 , while the latter increases by a factor of 20 .    , , and",
    "demonstrate features , usually attributed to the current universality traditionally observed in the continuous time random walk theory of scher and montroll @xcite or multiple trapping formalism with the exponential trap distribution @xcite .",
    "indeed , the pre - flight part of the tof curves for the dg model is a flat plateau with @xmath72 , while the post flight decay again follows the power law dependence with the exponent @xmath73 .",
    "these values agree well with the scher - montroll theory , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "additionally , the transients demonstrate universality with respect to the field and thickness variation .",
    "the only contradicting factor is the existence of the equilibration time , which does not scale properly with the time of flight .",

    "worse visual universality certainly follows from the much less reliable determination of @xmath40 from log - log plots.[fig7],width=288 ]    simulation data allows one to study the thickness dependence of the characteristic times of the transport process (  ) .",
    "obviously , @xmath69 does not depend on @xmath22 .",
    "times of flight found on log - log as well as lin - lin plots exhibit thickness dependence very close to a linear one as could be seen from and ( for @xmath77 v/@xmath1 m and @xmath78 transient is too dispersive to calculate @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) .",
    "@xmath51 , @xmath47 @xmath52 , and @xmath48 @xmath53 , correspondingly ; @xmath79 is the corresponding time for @xmath80 and straight line represents the linear dependence @xmath81 .",
    "electric field is 5 v/@xmath1m.[fig8],width=288 ]    until now we considered the classical tof geometry where an instantaneous generation of the thin sheet of carriers takes place near the generating electrode . recently",
    "two more geometries have been studied experimentally , namely , an instantaneous uniform generation of carriers in the bulk of the layer ( tof-2 ) , or similar bulk carrier generation with a regulated depth of the generation zone ( tof-1a ) @xcite . compares all three tof variants for an equal total number of generated carriers ( as always , in a small signal regime ) .",
    "as expected , if the tof transient demonstrates a flat plateau , then the corresponding tof-2 curve demonstrates an almost linear decay in the time range where the tof current remains constant .",
    "both transients decay similarly in the post - flight region , but the tof current is always greater than the tof-2 one , their ratio being practically constant ( in our case it is equal to 3.2 ) as the log - log plot shows ( , inset ) .",

    "dotted straight line has been drawn to emphasize the linear decay of transient 3 in the time interval corresponding to the plateau of transient 1 ; @xmath82 .",
    "inset shows tof ( 1 ) and tof-2 ( 3 ) transients in log - log plot .",
    "[ fig9],width=288 ]    the tof-1a transient , simulated for the thickness of the generation layer equal to @xmath83 , demonstrates typical features of quasi - equilibrium transport .",
    "the plateau becomes more tilted and its length is approximately twice shorter ( taking into account the accuracy of the mc simulation ) , as expected in this case @xcite .",
    "the most prominent features of the dg model are the pf field dependence of the carrier mobility , the particular shape of transients demonstrating the combination of a flat plateau with the slow post - flight current decay that follows a power law with the exponent @xmath46 close to 2.0 , and current universality with respect to @xmath10 and @xmath22 .",
    "the first feature was thoroughly discussed and explained earlier @xcite . here",
    "we would like to discuss the specific behavior of transients .",
    "it is worth noting that universality of transients has already been reported in experimental papers for non - dispersive charge transport @xcite .",
    "evidently , in our case development of a well - defined plateau can not be described by the usual approach where the long time behavior is governed by the diffusion equation ( such as the multiple - trapping model in the case of a fast decaying trap distribution @xcite ) and current decay follows the exponential time dependence .",
    "an alternative explanation was suggested by nikitenko et al .",
    "@xcite , who calculated an effective diffusion coefficient for the gdm and found that it slowly increases with time on a scale much longer that the typical equilibration time of the mean carrier velocity .",
    "detailed analysis of the long time behavior of transients was not performed but the particular case , shown in figure 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite , demonstrates approximate power law decay of the transient with the exponent @xmath46 close to 3 .",
    "applicability of this approach to the dg model is not evident , especially keeping in mind a well - established difference in the mobility field dependence in the gdm and dg model @xcite .",
    "in addition , mc simulations indicate that in the gdm for the case of strong disorder @xmath84 transients are much more dispersive : they do not develop a flat plateau and demonstrate a superlinear dependence of the transit time on the sample thickness @xcite . for these reasons",
    "we suggest a following simple phenomenological description of the charge transport .    formally , transport behavior found in our simulation",
    "can be described by the `` quasi - ballistic '' model ( qbm ) where a distribution of drift carrier velocities takes place in a trap free organic solid .",
    "indeed , let @xmath85 be the density distribution of equilibrated carrier velocities .",
    "if a carrier moves with some velocity @xmath86 , then at time @xmath87 it reaches the collecting electrode and does not contribute to the total current anymore .",
    "hence , in this model the current transient is @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a unit step function , and @xmath90 is the initial density of carriers . calculating the derivative , we obtain @xmath91 or @xmath92 in general , if @xmath93 for @xmath94 , then @xmath95 for @xmath96 .",
    "accordingly , for @xmath97 we have @xmath98 for @xmath96 .    in this model tof transients are universal and all transit times are strictly proportional to @xmath22 . assuming an abrupt decay of @xmath85 at @xmath99 we automatically obtain a flat plateau for @xmath100 .",
    "also , tof-2 transient should have a linear decay extending for a full length of the tof plateau , while the tof-1a transient should have a shortened plateau in comparison to the original tof one .",
    "thus , all dynamic features predicted by the dg model for all three variants of the time of flight technique are reproduced by the model .",
    "limitations of the qbm are obvious : it can not reproduce the non - equilibrium stage of the carrier transport , and the pf mobility field dependence has to be explicitly embedded into the model . yet",
    "the real problem is to derive the phenomenological ballistic model directly from the basic hopping transport of the dg model .",
    "at last we would like to discuss implications of the mc simulations regarding the prototype molecularly doped polymer 30% deh : pc thoroughly investigated in literature @xcite . at room temperature , it has been reported that pf slope is equal to 0.39 @xcite , 0.42 , @xcite and 0.46 ( @xmath1m / v)@xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the pf slope for the straight line in is slightly smaller and equals 0.32 ( @xmath1m / v)@xmath57 .",
    "also , the simulated tof transients are very similar to experimental ones @xcite , they demonstrate the same flat plateau and slow power law decay ( ) .",
    "systematic deviation at small @xmath101 is probably connected with electrode effects ( roughness of the electrode surface , presence of impurities , variation of the local structure of the material at the vicinity of the electrode ) .",
    "lattice planes ( 15.4 @xmath1 m ) and @xmath102 v/@xmath1 m with experimental transients measured at @xmath103 v/@xmath1 m in four samples with thickness varied in the range @xmath104 v/@xmath1 m ( dotted lines ) @xcite .",
    "difference in @xmath10 and @xmath22 between the simulated transient and experimental ones is unimportant due to universality ; timescales for experimental transients were re - scaled to obtain the best fit ( hence , in this figure we compare only the shapes of transients).[fig10],width=288 ]",
    "we performed monte carlo simulation for the dg model with a partially filled lattice where transport molecules occupy randomly 30% of all sites .",
    "analysis of simulated tof transients confirmed the model s unique properties such as observation of poole - frenkel mobility field dependence in a broad range from 5 to 200 v/@xmath1 m , development of a flat plateau ( @xmath105 ) followed by the slow power law current decay ( @xmath106 ) and transient universality with respect to both field and thickness .",
    "it has been shown that due to this universality one may use either lin - lin ( using @xmath47 as well as @xmath48 variant ) or log - log plots to investigate the field or thickness dependence of the carrier mobility .",
    "detailed examination of the tof transients at strong fields reveals the existence of the initial non - equilibrium relaxation of charge carriers .",
    "equilibration time is typically short in comparison to the drift time , does not depend on the sample thickness and exhibits strong field dependence , even more pronounced than the corresponding field dependence of the mobility .",
    "temporal behavior of the tof currents ( including tof-2 and tof-1a ) is well reproduced by a simple `` quasi - ballistic '' model which assumes a statistic ( and time - independent ) distribution @xmath85 of carrier drift velocities .",
    "if @xmath107 and @xmath85 drops abruptly at some velocity , then this model fairly well describes most prominent features of the simulated transients , the flat plateau followed by the power law decay @xmath0 .",
    "an attempt to fit dg simulation data to a prototype molecularly doped polymer was successful regarding the poole - frenkel slope ( 0.32 versus 0.39 ( @xmath1m / v)@xmath57 ) , if measured at moderate electric fields , and shape of the transients . to the best of our knowledge , at the moment",
    "there is no alternative transport model capable of reproducing both the experimental mobility field dependence and shape of the transients for some particular organic material in the direct mc simulation using transport parameters ( @xmath30 , @xmath108 , and @xmath5 ) , extracted from the tof experiments for the same material .",
