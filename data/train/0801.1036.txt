    "in this paper we deal with the problem of giving lower bounds to the number of @xmath0-facets of a set of points @xmath12 : an oriented simplex with vertices at points of @xmath12 is said to be a _",

    "if @xmath13 , a @xmath11-facet of @xmath12 is usually named a @xmath11-edge .    the number of @xmath11-facets of @xmath12 is denoted by @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the number of @xmath0-facets ( the set @xmath12 will be omitted when it is clear from the context ) .",
    "giving bounds on these quantities , and on the number of the companion concept of @xmath11-sets , is one of the central problems in discrete and computational geometry , and has a long history that we will not try to summarize here .",
    "chapter  8.3 in @xcite is a complete and up to date survey of results and open problems in the area .    regarding lower bounds for @xmath16 , which is the main topic of this paper , the problem",
    "was first studied by edelsbrunner et al .",
    "@xcite due to its connections with the complexity of higher order voronoi diagrams . in that paper",
    "it was stated that , in  @xmath17 , @xmath18 and it was given an example showing tightness for @xmath19 .",
    "the proof used circular sequences but , unfortunately , contained an unpluggable gap , as pointed out by lovsz et al .",
    "@xcite . a correct proof , also using circular sequences , was independently found by brego and fernndez - merchant  @xcite and lovsz et al .  @xcite . in both papers",
    "a strong connection was discovered between the number of @xmath0-edges and the number of convex quadrilaterals in a point set @xmath12 .",
    "specifically , if @xmath20 denotes the number of convex quadrilaterals in @xmath12 , in  @xcite it was shown that @xmath21 where @xmath22    giving lower bounds for @xmath20 is in turn equivalent to determining the rectilinear crossing number of the complete graph : if we draw @xmath5 on top of a set of points @xmath12 , then the number of intersections in the drawing is exactly the number of convex quadrilaterals in @xmath12 .",
    "the interested reader can go through the extensive online bibliography by vrto  @xcite where the focus is on the problem of crossing numbers of graphs .",
    "the lower bound in equation  [ eq : old - lb ] was slightly improved for @xmath23 by balogh and salazar  @xcite , again using circular sequences . using different techniques , and based on the observation that it suffices to proof the bound for sets with triangular convex hull , we have recently shown  @xcite that , in  @xmath17 ,",
    "@xmath24 if @xmath8 is divisible by @xmath25 , this expression can be written as @xmath26    in this paper we deal with three different problems related to lower bounds for @xmath27 : in section  2 , we study structural properties of those sets in  @xmath17 that achieve the lower bound in equation  [ eq : old - lb ] for a fixed @xmath19 .",
    "the main result of this section is that if  @xmath16 is minimum for a given  @xmath11 , then  @xmath28 is also minimum for every @xmath29 . in section",
    "3 we give a construction which shows tightness of the lower bound in equation  [ eq : lb ] in the range @xmath30 . finally , in section  4 we study the d - dimensional version of the problem and show that , for a set of  @xmath8 points in general position in  @xmath9 , @xmath31 and that this bound is tight in that range . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first result of this kind in  @xmath9 .",
    "given  @xmath13 , let us denote by  @xmath32 the set of all @xmath0-edges of @xmath12 , hence @xmath16 is the cardinality of @xmath32 . throughout this section",
    "we consider @xmath33 .",
    "recall that for a fixed such  @xmath11 , @xmath16 is optimal if @xmath34 .",
    "recall also that , by definition , a @xmath35-edge has exactly  @xmath35 points of  @xmath12 in the positive side of its affine hull , which in this case is the open half plane to the right of its supporting line .",
    "we start by giving a new , simple , and self - contained proof of the bound in equation  [ eq : old - lb ] , using a new technique which will be useful in the rest of the section .",
    "although in this section they will be used in  @xmath17 , the following notions are presented in  @xmath9 for the sake of generality and in view of section  [ sec : rd ] .",
    "let @xmath12 be a set of @xmath8 points and @xmath36 a family of sets in @xmath9 .",
    "a subset @xmath37 is called an _ @xmath38-net _ of @xmath12 ( with respect to @xmath36 ) if for every @xmath39 such that @xmath40 we have that @xmath41 .",

    "a simplicial @xmath44-net will be called a _ simplicial half - net_.    [ l : net ] every set @xmath13 of @xmath8 points has a simplicial half - net .",
    "let @xmath45 be a triangle spanned by three vertices of the convex hull of @xmath12 .",
    "an edge @xmath46 of @xmath45 is called _ good _ if the closed half plane of its supporting line which contains the third vertex of @xmath45 , contains at least @xmath47 points from @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath45 is called _ good _ if it consists of three good edges . clearly , the vertices of a good triangle are a simplicial half - net of @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath45 be an arbitrary triangle spanned by vertices of the convex hull of @xmath12 and assume that @xmath45 is not good .",
    "then observe that only one edge @xmath46 of @xmath45 is not good and let @xmath48 be the vertex of @xmath45 not incident to @xmath46 .",
    "choose a point @xmath49 of the convex hull of @xmath12 opposite to @xmath48 with respect to @xmath46 .",
    "then @xmath46 and @xmath49 induce a triangle @xmath50 in which @xmath46 is a good edge .",
    "if @xmath50 is a good triangle we are done .",
    "otherwise we iterate this process .",
    "as the cardinalities of the subsets of vertices of @xmath12 considered are strictly decreasing ( the subsets being restricted by the half plane induced by @xmath46 ) , the process terminates with a good triangle .",
    "[ t : lb1 ] for every set @xmath12 of @xmath8 points and @xmath51 we have @xmath52 .",

    "let @xmath54 and consider an edge @xmath55 .",
    "we observe that @xmath45 can not be to the right of @xmath46 : there are at least @xmath47 points on the closed half - plane to the left of @xmath46 and that would contradict the definition of @xmath44-net .",
    "therefore , @xmath56 .",
    "if we denote by @xmath57 the set of @xmath0-edges of  @xmath12 adjacent to points in @xmath45 , we have that @xmath58    there are @xmath59 @xmath0-edges incident to each of the convex hull vertices @xmath60 ( which can be obtained rotating a ray based on that vertex ) .",
    "we observe that at most three edges of @xmath57 might be incident to two points of  @xmath45 ( those of the triangle  @xmath45 ) and that the union in equation  [ eq : sets ] is disjoint .",
    "therefore , using the induction hypothesis we have @xmath61    [ cor : subset ] let @xmath12 be a set of @xmath8 points , @xmath62 a simplicial half - net of @xmath12 and @xmath54 . if @xmath63 then :    * @xmath64 . *",
    "a @xmath11-edge of @xmath12 is either a @xmath65-edge of @xmath66 or is adjacent to a point in @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath63 , both inequalities in equation  [ eq : th1 ] are tight . therefore @xmath67 and equation  [ eq : sets ] becomes @xmath68 ( disjoint union ) which trivially implies part ( b ) .",

    "thus @xmath76 and therefore @xmath77 .",
    "assume now @xmath78 .",
    "then at most two @xmath75-edges can be counted twice , namely the two diagonals of the convex hull .",
    "thus we have @xmath79 @xmath80-edges and we conclude that if @xmath71 , then @xmath12 has a triangular convex hull .    for the general case",
    "consider @xmath81 , let @xmath62 be the simplicial half - net guaranteed by lemma  [ l : net ] and let @xmath82 . from corollary  [ cor : subset ] , part  ( a ) , we know that @xmath67 and , by induction , we may assume that @xmath66 has a triangular convex hull .",
    "moreover , from part  ( b ) , no @xmath83-edge of @xmath66 can be an @xmath0-edge of @xmath12 and , therefore , any @xmath83-edge of @xmath66 must have two vertices of @xmath45 on its positive side .",
    "consider the six @xmath83-edges of @xmath66 incident to the three convex hull vertices of @xmath66 : see figure  [ fig : triangular ] , where the supporting lines of these @xmath83-edges are drawn as dashed lines and @xmath66 is depicted as the central triangle .",
    "each cell outside @xmath66 in the arrangement of the supporting lines contains a number counting the  @xmath83-edges considered which have that cell on their positive side .",
    "a simple counting argument shows that the only way of placing the three vertices @xmath60 of @xmath45 such that each @xmath83-edge of @xmath66 drawn has three of them on its positive side is to place one in each cell labeled with a 4 .",
    "we conclude that no vertex of  @xmath66 can be on the convex hull of @xmath12 and the theorem follows .",

    "using the same argument as in the proof of theorem  [ thm : hull3 ] , it follows that we can iteratively remove the outermost @xmath84 layers to obtain optimal subsets , which , by theorem  [ thm : hull3 ] , have triangular convex hulls .",

    "@xmath93 is also optimal because the convex hull of @xmath12 is the triangle  @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , to prove optimality of @xmath88 it only remains to show that no @xmath65-edge of @xmath66 can be a @xmath83-edge of @xmath12 .",
    "so let @xmath46 be a @xmath65-edge of @xmath66 and let @xmath94 and @xmath95 be the vertices of the convex hull of  @xmath66 incident to @xmath46 or on its positive side .",
    "the existence of @xmath94 and @xmath95 is guaranteed by corollary  [ cor : subset ] , part  ( b ) . without loss of generality ,",

    "the _ boundary chain _ is the lower envelope of  @xmath97 ,  @xmath96 , and @xmath98 .",

    "now we are ready to count the total number of  @xmath0-edges incident to points  @xmath117 on the first chain , which is : @xmath129 where the first three summands come from the first ranges of the three cases above , while the two remaining summands come from the second ranges in cases  @xmath130 and  @xmath131 .",
    "merging the first three summands and rewriting the two latter ones , the above sum equals @xmath132 where the first equality comes from neglecting the negative summands , due to the above mentioned empty ranges , and merging the first two sums .",

    "the proof follows the approach in theorem  [ t : lb1 ] , using the fact that every set of points has a centerpoint : a point  @xmath135 is a _ centerpoint _ of  @xmath12 if no open halfspace that avoids  @xmath136 contains more than @xmath137 points of  @xmath12 ( see  @xcite ) .",

    "let us consider a simplex @xmath45 with vertices in the convex hull of @xmath12 and containing @xmath136 and let @xmath82 . from the definition of centerpoint",
    ", it follows that no open halfspace that avoids  @xmath45 contains more than  points or , equivalently , every closed halfspace containing  @xmath45 has at least @xmath144 points .",

    "every @xmath35-facet of  @xmath12 is defined by @xmath140 points on different chains , because a facet defined by two points in the same chain has at least @xmath169 points on each halfspace .",
    "if we label the points of each chain from  @xmath74 to  @xmath171 ( starting from the convex hull ) and consider @xmath172 , they define a @xmath173-facet .",
    "therefore , the number of @xmath0-facets defined by one point on each of these chains equals the cardinality of the set @xmath174 which is exactly  @xmath175 .",
    "since these are the facets defined by points in @xmath140 out of the @xmath43 chains , the total number of @xmath0-facets of the set is exactly  @xmath10 .",
    "for  @xmath13 we have shown that , for a fixed @xmath176 , if @xmath16 is optimal , i.e. @xmath177 , then  @xmath28 is also optimal in the whole range @xmath178 , which in turn implies that @xmath103 for  @xmath179 . moreover , then the outermost @xmath180 layers of  @xmath12 are triangles and these layers consist entirely of @xmath35-edges of special types .",
