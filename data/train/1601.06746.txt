    "several studies in string theory @xcite , noncommutative geometry @xcite and loop quantum gravity @xcite suggest the existence of a minimal length . the main argument would be that at the planck scale , the heisenberg uncertainty principle would be substituted by the generalized uncertainty principle @xcite .",
    "the necessity of introducing a minimal length scale in physical theories is an old concept since the thirties @xcite . in 1938 ,",
    "heisenberg have published this idea as a way to cure the divergence problems that have been dwelled in qft computation since the earlier times .",
    "for example , in the scattering process computations in qed , or , as another example , in order to calculate the compton effect scattering cross section , the final result showed infinite values , which is a nightmare if you want to obtain a numerical result . in this scenario ,",
    "the minimal length scale would be a universal constant . as well known , the vacuum velocity of light ( @xmath0 ) represents the scale of velocity where the effects of the special relativity are relevant , as well as the planck constant ( @xmath1 ) represents the microscopic scale governing the quantum world , where the effects of quantum mechanics are important .",
    "another well known constant is the gravitational constant ( @xmath2 ) , which measures the gravitational interactions between masses .    in 1900",
    ", planck has suggested that the combination between the underlying constants of nature , i.e. , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , would form the length scale @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the planck length .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) shows that the unification of the three underlying constants demonstrates that the planck length must be the proper scale where the gravitational effects in the quantum world are relevant .",
    "the first physical theory in which it was introduced a length scale was based in the notion of the noncommutativity of space - time , where the coordinates @xmath5 are promoted to hermitian operators in quantum mechanics , i.e. , @xmath6 , do not commute , and have the following commutation relation @xmath7=i \\ , \\ell^2 \\ ,",
    "\\theta^{\\mu\\nu } \\ , \\hat{\\uma } \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is a length scale , and @xmath9 is a constant @xmath10 antisymmetric matrix .",
    "notice that at the limit where @xmath11 , the standard quantum theory can be obtained . in this scenario",
    "the space - time coordinates are observables that do not commute .",
    "this fact changes the understanding of the space - time geometry in this length scale . as a consequence ,",
    "the concept of position measure in this space - time would change also , where the heisenberg uncertainty principle must be satisfied @xmath12 however , a short time later , c. n. yang has shown that snyder s theory did not solve the infinities problems in qft .",
    "this fact has led the nc theory to a deep sleep for about fifty years . only after an important result that has came from string theory",
    "@xcite , where a string embedded into a magnetic background , shows nc features concerning the space coordinates .",
    "this result made the noncommutativity issue to be a top subject in theoretical physics @xcite during the last years .",
    "in current days , new analysis of string theory and quantum gravity , suggest us the existence of a minimal length in nature @xcite . this conclusion has motivated the reformulation of quantum mechanics together with the gravitation theories and qft , which were built only in the presence of a minimal length scale .",
    "another possibility of introducing a minimal length scale @xmath8 leaves the direct modification of the uncertainty relation in quantum mechanics @xcite , namely , @xmath13 \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the particle position and momentum must be changed within a quantum theory scenario where the scale @xmath8 must be relevant",
    "( [ relincl ] ) is the well known generalized uncertainty principle , which can be seen also ( as we have just said ) as the origin of the appearance of a minimal length since it can be written in an even more general way such as    @xmath14 \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 and @xmath15 are positive and independent parameters of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",

    "the standard heisenberg uncertainty relation can be recovered from ( [ relincl2 ] ) by doing @xmath20 .",

    "since we have very small terms , we propose the series above becomes a general uncertainty relation given by the exponential function @xmath24 \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this scenario , it is easy to see that the modified uncertainty relation lead us to a measure of the minimum uncertainty for the position given by @xmath25 where @xmath8 acts as the minimal length scale , and any measure of the system can not be less than its value , which corresponds to the maximum value for the linear momentum given by @xmath26 hence , the maximum energy scale relative to these values is @xmath27 since @xmath8 has a very small value , the minimum uncertainty for the value of the energy has a very high value , if it can be compared to the energy scale of the modern particle accelerators .",

    "<S> the main motivation to study models in the presence of a minimal length is to obtain a quantum field theory free of the divergences . in this way , in this paper , we have constructed a new framework for quantum electrodynamics embedded in a minimal length scale background . </S>",
    "<S> new operators are introduced and the green function method was used for the solution of the field equations , i.e. , the maxwell , klein - gordon and dirac equations . </S>",
    "<S> we have analyzed specifically the scalar field and its one loop propagator . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of the scalar field regularized by the minimal length was obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the qed lagrangian containing a minimal length was also constructed and the divergences were analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> the electron and photon propagators , and the electron self - energy at one loop as a function of the minimal length was also obtained . </S>"
