    "it is of considerable current interest to efficiently identify clusters and other concentrations of galaxies at @xmath20 in order to study the evolution of both galaxies and large scale structure .",
    "radio - loud quasars ( rlqs ) are among the obvious signposts around which to search for clusters at @xmath20 .",
    "this is because rlqs almost exclusively reside in giant elliptical galaxies ( a strongly clustered population ) and some rlqs have been spectroscopically confirmed to inhabit clusters at @xmath21 @xcite . in @xcite , hereafter hgc98 , and @xcite , hereafter hg98 , we presented optical ( @xmath22 ) and near - ir ( @xmath23 ) imaging of the fields of 31 rlqs at @xmath0 which revealed an excess of predominantly red galaxies at @xmath24 .",
    "the excess has two spatial components  one within 40  of the quasars and one extending out to at least @xmath25  consistent with the quasars often residing in galaxy groups or poor clusters which are themselves found within richer filaments or sheets of galaxies .",
    "the images of hgc98 were at most 3@xmath263  in size , and so could only place a lower limit on the size of the large - scale galaxy excess ( relative to blank - field galaxy counts at these magnitudes ) around the quasars .",
    "the magnitude and color distributions of the excess galaxies are consistent with a population of predominantly early - type galaxies at the quasar redshifts . however , a possible exception is some or all of the @xmath6-band dropouts ( @xmath4 ) found in five fields for which we have @xmath6 imaging .",
    "such very red @xmath3  colors require that the galaxies are reddened by dust , are at @xmath27 so that the 4000    break lies beyond the @xmath6 band , or both .",
    "spectroscopic confirmation of overdensities at the quasar redshifts in these rlq fields is still lacking , as are spectroscopic redshifts for the @xmath6-band dropouts , due to the difficulty of obtaining spectroscopic redshifts for galaxies at @xmath28 , and extremely red galaxies at all @xmath29 . to provide a more comprehensive picture of these systems in the absence of spectroscopy , in this paper we present further analyses of the excess galaxy population as well as various new observations of four of these rlq fields .",
    "the results reported here supersede earlier results reported as work in progress in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in  [ wide - field ] we present new wide - field near - ir imaging and study the extent of the galaxy overdensities . in  [ surf ] we discuss the surface density of extremely red objects ( eros ) in these rlq fields compared to field surveys . in  [ irtf ] we present narrow - band imaging sensitive to h@xmath9  emission from galaxies at the quasar redshifts . in  [ submm ] we present sub - millimeter mapping sensitive to dust in luminous star - forming galaxies . in  [ aob ] we present adaptive - optics imaging of two galaxies . in  [ photz ] we present multicolor sed fits used to derive photometric redshifts , reddenings , and age estimates for selected galaxies .",
    "we summarize our results in  [ concl ] .",
    "we adopt a @xmath30 cosmology with @xmath31=75 km  s@xmath32  mpc@xmath32 and @xmath33=0.1 ( for a projected scale of 7.4  @xmath34 kpc / arcsec at @xmath35 ) . except as noted for comparison with the literature .",
    "we obtained @xmath6 and @xmath7 data over wider fields around two rlqs from hgc98 to help verify the reality of the large - scale galaxy excess and to search for additional @xmath6-band dropouts .",

    "the near - ir imaging data were reduced using phiirs .",

    "object detection and photometry using focas @xcite followed the procedure of hgc98 .",

    "pisces has significant optical distortions in both @xmath6 and @xmath7 which must be removed before coadding",
    ". observations of m  67 @xcite were used to calculate distortion solutions for the april 1999 run , yielding images oriented to true north and east ( as defined by the usnoa-2.0 catalog ) to within @xmath390.12  accuracy .",
    "calibration used arnica @xcite and nicmos @xcite standards and assumed extinction coefficients of 0.08 in @xmath6 and 0.07 in @xmath7 . both object detection and aperture definition",
    "were done on the summed @xmath40 image ( total area 52.561  arcmin@xmath38 ) , and focas total magnitudes were produced using those same apertures on the @xmath6 and @xmath7 images .",
    "we imaged q  1126 + 101  with the near - infrared imager / spectrograph tifkam ( a.k.a .",
    "onis at kitt peak ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at the 2.4 m hiltner telescope of the mdm observatory .",
    "tifkam has a @xmath41 insb array with a platescale of 03/pixel at the 2.4 m , corresponding to a @xmath42 field of view .",
    "we observed a field centered @xmath43 w of the quasar ( which includes the quasar near the eastern edge of the array ) in @xmath6 and @xmath7 in nonphotometric conditions of @xmath3615 seeing .",
    "the coadded images were trimmed to the region of maximum exposure time ( 12.051 arcmin@xmath38 ) .",
    "the final @xmath6 and @xmath7 images completely overlap the @xmath44band data of hgc98 and partially overlap the @xmath6 and @xmath7 data of hgc98 .",
    "we rotated and magnified our new near - infrared observations to match those images and then catalogued all the objects in the sum of the @xmath45 image and our new @xmath6 and @xmath7 images .",
    "finally , we calibrated our @xmath6 and @xmath7 images using the objects in common with hgc98 .",
    "the @xmath46 galaxy surface density is 17.5@xmath80.6 arcmin@xmath47 in the q  0835 + 580  field and 20.7@xmath81.3 arcmin@xmath47 in the q  1126 + 101  field .",
    "these values are respectively @xmath48 and @xmath49 above the literature compilation value of 13.7@xmath81.5 ( including rms field - to - field scatter ) from hg98 .",
    "both values agree within @xmath50 with those measured in hgc98 using smaller ( @xmath363@xmath263 ) images of these fields .",
    "the @xmath51 galaxy surface density is 11.8@xmath80.5 arcmin@xmath47 in the q  0835 + 580  field and 14.2@xmath81.1 arcmin@xmath47 in the q  1126 + 101  field .",
    "these values are slightly higher than the @xmath6-band field galaxy counts of @xcite and @xmath52 higher than those of @xcite .",
    "thus these new wide - field observations confirm that the surface density of faint @xmath6- and @xmath53-selected galaxies is higher in these rlq fields than in random fields .",
    "the radial distribution of all @xmath46 galaxies relative to q  0835 + 580   ( figure  [ fig_rp]a ) shows a clear excess at @xmath5420 .",
    "there also appears to be an overdensity extending out to @xmath36140   ( @xmath55  mpc ) . from the surface density at @xmath56140",
    ", we would expect 245 galaxies within 140  of the quasar .",
    "we observe 285 , which is a @xmath57 excess .",
    "the radial distribution of all @xmath46 galaxies relative to q  1126 + 101   ( figure  [ fig_rp]b ) shows a constant surface density within the uncertainties to 180 , apart from a weak excess at @xmath58 .",
    "given this relatively flat radial distribution , part of the excess population of faint @xmath6- and @xmath53-selected galaxies in the q  1126 + 101  field is probably unrelated to the quasar .",
    "this is consistent with the @xmath3 and @xmath59 color distributions , which show an excess of blue galaxies as well as of the red galaxies we expect to find at the quasar redshifts .",
    "another possibility is a structure at the quasar redshift of size @xmath60  mpc ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is less probable but can not be ruled out without spectroscopy or data on even wider fields .    as a measure of the richness of the structure around q  0835 + 580",
    ", we computed @xmath61 @xcite , the excess number of galaxies within 0.5  mpc of the quasar and no more than 3 magnitudes fainter than a brightest cluster galaxy at the quasar redshift .",
    "@xmath61 was computed as in hg98 except that galaxies @xmath56140  from the quasar were used as the background , rather than the average literature counts .",
    "we find @xmath61=27@xmath811 ( corresponding to abell richness 2@xmath81 ) compared to the value of 16@xmath813 found in hg98 .",
    "this newer , more robust measurement illustrates the value of wide - field data in determining the background counts locally rather than taking them from the literature or from small radii which may still be inside the large - scale structure being studied . in the case of q  1126 + 101 , even though the overall counts in the field are higher than the literature average , wide - field data suggests that the quasar is only embedded in a small - scale overdensity .",
    "since the appearance of infrared array detectors , numerous discoveries of extremely red objects ( eros ) have been noted in the literature ( for recent summaries see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "eros remain a poorly understood population of galaxies about which several different interpretations are plausible .",
    "their observed colors of @xmath62 are so red that they seem to be explainable only by old stellar populations at @xmath29 or by heavily dust - reddened galaxies or agn preferentially located at @xmath29 .",
    "this is confirmed by the handful of spectroscopic redshifts for eros @xcite and very red objects ( vros ) , as defined by ( * ? ? ?",
    " [ photboth ] ) .",
    "previous narrow - field optical and near - ir surveys have hinted that eros are more common along lines of sight to distant agn ( for recent summaries see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our @xmath0 rlq fields can be used to test this hypothesis more carefully , using recent estimates of the surface density of field eros from wide - field surveys .",
    "@xcite find 29 @xmath63 eros with @xmath64 in four fields of @xmath36150  arcmin@xmath38 each , for a surface density of 0.048@xmath65 arcmin@xmath47 ( we use the methods of @xcite to find all @xmath66 poissonian uncertainties where small number statistics apply ) .",
    "the details for one field have been published in thompson _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1999a ; hereafter t99 ) .",
    "the t99 @xmath67 observations were calibrated using ukirt standards @xcite , as were the @xmath7 observations of hg98 .",
    "we refer to both magnitudes simply as @xmath53 hereafter .",
    "we also adopt @xmath68 as the definition of a ero , or @xmath69 for gunn @xmath45 imaging such as ours ( hg98 , appendix a ) , and @xmath70 as the division between bright and faint eros .",
    "however , we conservatively adopt a @xmath71 detection limit in the optical instead of @xmath72 as in t99 .",
    "this yields a difference of @xmath36044 in the lower limit on the @xmath59 color of undetected objects .",
    "we select eros from all 22 rlq fields of hgc98 with @xmath71 limits of @xmath73 and @xmath74 limits of @xmath75 and from the new larger area around q  1126 + 101  imaged with tifkam (  [ wf1126 ] ) .",
    "the total area is 160.95  arcmin@xmath38 , almost identical to that of t99 , and the depth of our imaging is also similar .",
    "we find 24 eros , including two presumed stars unresolved in archival hst wfpc2 snapshots and one presumed star identified via its blue @xmath3  color .",
    "four of the remaining 21 eros are compact enough that they could be stars given the seeing , but the rest are extended .",
    "t99 found two of their eight bright eros to be unresolved in 1@xmath761 seeing , and both were subsequently confirmed to be stars .",
    "there is no reason to expect more stellar contamination in our ero sample than in the t99 sample , since both are from high galactic latitude fields of almost exactly the same total areas .",
    "therefore we assume that only three of our 24 eros are stars .",
    "the remaining 21 @xmath59  selected extragalactic eros yield a surface density of 0.130@xmath77 arcmin@xmath47 to @xmath70 , which is 2.7 times higher than the field ero counts of @xcite and a @xmath78 excess over the number expected in this area based on those counts .",
    "this is consistent with the excesses found by the smaller surveys of @xcite at @xmath79 around 4 radio galaxies with @xmath80 and @xcite at @xmath81 in 40  arcmin@xmath38 around 14 radio - loud agn with @xmath82 .",

    "stellar contamination of these @xmath3 selected eros should be negligible .",
    "a literature search revealed no predicted colors of @xmath85 for unreddened stars of any type from brown dwarf to supergiant and very few observations of objects with @xmath4 which were not galaxies : two objects presumed to be stars since they were unresolved on @xmath86 wfpc2 images @xcite and a small number of known agn @xcite .",
    "thus objects with @xmath4 are almost certainly not stars , are unlikely to be agn , and are probably galaxies .    in four rlq fields from hgc98 with deep @xmath6 data ( q  0835 + 580 , q  0952 + 179 , q  1126 + 101 , and q  1258 + 404 )",
    ", we find six such @xmath3 selected eros .",
    "we also find three @xmath3 selected eros in the new area around q  0835 + 580  imaged with pisces , but none in the new area around q  1126 + 101  imaged with tifkam .",
    "five of the eros are from the q  1126 + 101  field , which as discussed in hg98 has a considerable excess of these @xmath6-band dropouts . ) between the old hgc98 and new tifkam datasets .",
    "examination of the images suggests that their @xmath6 fluxes were probably underestimated in hgc98 .",
    "the hgc98 kpno 4 m irim data required ` destriping ' to remove the large scale scattered light pattern present in some fields ( see  3.2.7 of hgc98 ) .",
    "the new @xmath6 data shows that this procedure worked quite well overall , but in a few cases the masking of objects was insufficient to prevent removal of some real flux . ]",
    "excluding the q  1126 + 101  field because of its excess number of these objects , we find four @xmath3  selected eros in 70.373  arcmin@xmath38 for a surface density of 0.057@xmath87  arcmin@xmath47 , within @xmath66 of the field measurement of @xcite . in the q  1126 + 101  field we find 3 eros in 15.549  arcmin@xmath38 for a surface density of 0.19@xmath88  arcmin@xmath47 , 3.3 times higher than in random fields but only significant at 1.54@xmath89 due to small number statistics .",
    "we also consider the surface density of @xmath6-band dropouts in the q  1126 + 101   field to @xmath90 , since all our data reaches deep enough to select eros with @xmath4 to at least this magnitude . in the new tifkam q  1126",

    "the enhancement in the q  1126 + 101  field is still a factor of three or more , but remains only @xmath94 significance due to small number statistics .",
    "the same holds true down to @xmath95 in the hgc98 data alone .",
    "deeper or wider - field data are unlikely to dramatically increase the statistical significance of the overdensity of @xmath6-band dropouts , but their clustered distribution within the q  1126 + 101  field ( figure  24 of hg98 ) and the overdensity of galaxies with less extreme colors suggests that this is a physical concentration and not just a random fluctuation .",
    "however , some recent work suggests that such random field - to - field fluctuations can be quite substantial even to @xmath90 and beyond ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we find bright @xmath59  selected eros with @xmath96 to be 2.7 times more common in the fields of 22 rlqs with @xmath97 than in the general field .",
    "we find @xmath3  selected eros with @xmath83 to be from 1 to 3.3 times as common in the fields of four rlqs with @xmath98 , depending on whether the q  1126 + 101  field is included or not .",
    "these quantitative measurements show that the excess ero surface density around distant agn is considerably smaller than previous estimates of a factor of 10 to 100 excess @xcite .",
    "one outstanding question regarding eros is their intrinsic luminosities .",
    "the presence of the quasars in these fields enables us to estimate the luminosities of the @xmath59  selected eros by assuming that the eros are at the quasar redshifts .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption since there is no evidence for strong or weak gravitational lensing in these fields and since the excess galaxy population is concentrated around the quasars but not correlated with the presence of intervening mgii  absorption systems ( see  2 and  4.3 of hg98 for details and discussion , and  [ photboth ] for further evidence of association ) .",
    "assuming the eros in each field are at the redshift of the quasar in that field ( @xmath54@xmath14@xmath56=1.61 ) and applying elliptical @xmath99-corrections only from @xcite , we find @xmath100=25.4@xmath80.5 for the @xmath59  selected eros in our standard cosmology .",
    "applying evolutionary corrections ( @xmath101-corrections ) from @xcite as well , we find @xmath100=24.1@xmath80.4 .",
    "this is consistent with the @xcite measurement of @xmath102=24.2@xmath80.2 for field galaxies at @xmath54@xmath103@xmath56=0.14 ( see hg98  5.1 ) and with the @xcite measurement of @xmath102=23.9 in the coma cluster .",
    "thus , these eros have absolute magnitudes consistent with those expected for passively evolving luminous elliptical galaxies at the quasar redshifts , and need not be an extraordinarily luminous galaxy population . the higher density of eros in rlq fields can be easily understood if the rlqs are located in overdense regions .",
    "our measured ero luminosities are consistent with the estimated luminosity evolution in @xmath104 for excess galaxies to @xmath105 in these fields (  5 of hg98 ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "the faint end of our ero distribution is set by our @xmath96 selection criterion , however , so we can say nothing further about the ero luminosity function .",
    "using @xmath99- and @xmath101- corrections for bluer galaxies of later spectral types yields higher estimated luminosities for the eros , but the red colors of these eros strongly suggest that such corrections are not appropriate . on the other hand , if dust reddening is important for these eros at @xmath20 but not for their descendants at @xmath106 , strong @xmath99- and @xmath101- corrections would be required .",
    "if dust were important we might expect considerable overlap between @xmath59  and @xmath3  selected eros .",
    "@xcite find that only 4 of 29 @xmath59  selected eros are @xmath3  selected eros , and of our four objects with @xmath107 and @xmath6 data , only one has @xmath4 .",
    "our sed fitting (  [ photboth ] ) yields a best - fit @xmath16=0.75@xmath80.50 for this object , @xmath16=0.45@xmath80.20 for one of the @xmath108 objects , and @xmath16=0 for the remaining two @xmath108 objects .",
    "if the same fractions hold among the @xmath59  selected eros of @xcite , up to @xmath3612 of 29 ( @xmath3640% ) could have strong dust reddening .",
    "multicolor data on larger @xmath59  selected ero samples reaching fainter magnitudes will be needed to determine how frequent and strong dust reddening really is among eros , but for now we make no correction for dust reddening .",
    "h@xmath9 is a good tracer of the instantaneous star formation rate ( sfr ) in galaxies @xcite .",
    "narrow - band surveys until recently yielded only limits on the space density of h@xmath9 emitters at @xmath20 , even in the fields of quasars and radio galaxies ( pahre & djorgovski 1995 )",
    ". however , in the past few years detections have been made of objects located in random fields and objects associated with damped ly@xmath9 absorbers , with strong intervening metal - line absorbers , or with quasars or radio galaxies ( for a recent overview see * ? ? ?",
    "given the excess galaxy population seen in our rlq fields , they make promising targets for narrow - band observations to search for h@xmath9 emission at the quasar redshifts . in particular , we would hope to detect galaxies whose seds suggest they are dust - reddened and thus possibly actively star - forming and we would expect not to detect galaxies whose seds suggest they are old and dust - free .",

    "there is a continuum of properties across our dividing line between successful and unsuccessful fits , of course , but objects not successfully fit typically have large photometric errors which prevent their seds from usefully constraining the fitted parameters .",

    "larger samples plus spectroscopic redshifts and spectral types are clearly desirable to calibrate this classification system . for now , we note that the general trend of objects with larger @xmath16  being redder in @xmath3 is valid , but that this trend is not accurately predictive on an object by object basis .",
    "@xmath16  @xmath261 objects may be an exception , since they seem to occupy a distinct region of the diagram with little contamination .",
    "we also note that our results may differ from those of @xcite , who assembled _ hst _ images of a heterogeneous sample of vros and eros in both blank and candidate high - redshift cluster fields .",
    "they found that vros and eros with irregular morphologies , which are likely to include a higher percentage of star - forming galaxies than objects with regular morphologies , tend to have redder @xmath217 or @xmath262 colors . we may be able to compare these irregular eros to objects in our sample which have large best - fit @xmath16  values , which also should include a higher percentage of star - forming galaxies than galaxies with low reddenings .",

    "our heavily reddened eros and the irregular eros of @xcite may be different populations , of course , but it would be very interesting if they were in fact comparable . in that case this result would indicate a breakdown in the relationship between morphology and star formation properties at @xmath263 ; for example , if we are seeing irregular galaxies with relatively old or quiescent stellar populations , and young or actively star forming galaxies with nonetheless regular morphologies .    to test the sensitivity of our fits to metallicity , we refit 16 objects using solar metallicity models instead of 20% solar ones .",
    "these solar fits had comparable @xmath168 , with a tendency toward worse fits on average .",
    "best - fit redshifts and @xmath16  values were unaffected by the different metallicity , with no discrepancies at @xmath5690% confidence .",
    "best - fit ages were found to be more sensitive to the metallicity , but even so , only in five cases where the solar metallicity fits had lower @xmath168  did the best - fit ages change ( decrease ) at @xmath26490% confidence .",
    "all five cases are best - fit instantaneous bursts , and four are @xmath16  @xmath261 objects .",
    "this is consistent with our @xmath16  values being essentially the same for solar and 20% solar metallicity fits ; the majority of our objects require dust for both metallicities , while a minority do not require it for either metallicity .",
    "finally , we attempted to fit four objects with @xmath265 , suggestive of a spectral break near 1 , which have neither @xmath236 nor @xmath4 .",
    "one object  q  1126 + 101  ( 253 )  was not successfully fit due to its detection only in @xmath6 and @xmath53 .",

    "q  0835 + 580  ( 343 ) and ( 379 ) have fits similar to those of vros and eros .",
    "the @xmath236 definition of a vro is somewhat arbitrary , and these two red @xmath245 objects have @xmath266 , so the similarity of their fits to those of vros is not surprising .",
    "q  1126 + 101  ( 269 ) also has a best fit similar to those of vros or eros , but it has a large @xmath168  value .",
    "we believe this is because it has only a moderately red color @xmath267 which our simple stellar population models have trouble fitting simultaneously with this object s very red @xmath268 . a higher metallicity model with a slight contribution from an unreddened young population is probably needed to improve the @xmath168  for this object . with @xmath168  @xmath269 .",

    "many of these objects sed fits yield photometric redshifts consistent with the quasar redshifts . we find that significant dust is required to fit most of these objects , including about half of those which also require old ages .",

    "the minority population has no dust and is red due to age and/or high metallicity , while the majority population is red due to dust , albeit with old age contributing to the red colors in some cases .",

    "<S> we show that these fields have a surface density of extremely red objects ( eros , with @xmath1 ) 2.7 times higher than the general field . assuming these eros are passively evolved galaxies at the quasar redshifts , they have characteristic luminosities of only @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> . only one of four rlq fields has an excess of @xmath3 selected eros with @xmath4 ; thus , those objects are mostly unrelated to the quasars .    </S>",
    "<S> we also present new multiwavelength data and analyses on the fields of four of these quasars at @xmath5 , obtained to build more detailed pictures of the environments of these quasars and the galaxies within them . </S>",
    "<S> first , wide - field @xmath6 and @xmath7  data shows that the galaxy excess around q  0835 + 580   is of abell richness 2@xmath81 and extends to 140 , and that the galaxy excess around q  1126 + 101  extends to only 50  even though the overall counts in the field are higher than the literature average . </S>",
    "<S> second , in three fields we present the deepest narrow - band redshifted h@xmath9 observations yet published . </S>",
    "<S> we detect five candidate galaxies at the quasar redshifts , a surface density 2.5 times higher than in the only existing random - field survey of similar depth . </S>",
    "<S> however , photometric spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting of one candidate suggests it is an [ oiii ]  detection background to the quasar . </S>",
    "<S> third , scuba submillimeter observations of three fields detect two of the quasars and two galaxies with seds best fit as highly reddened galaxies at the quasar redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> fourth , @xmath10-band adaptive optics ( ao ) imaging is used to estimate redshifts for two moderately red bulge - dominated galaxies in the q  0835 + 580  field using the kormendy relation between central surface brightness and half - light radius . </S>",
    "<S> both have structural redshifts consistent with early - type galaxies foreground to the quasar at @xmath11 or @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> photometric redshifts do not confirm these structural redshifts , however , possibly because our optical photometry for these objects is corrupted by scattered light from the nearby bright ao guidestar . </S>",
    "<S> finally , quantitative sed fits are presented for numerous galaxies of interest in two fields and are used to constrain their photometric redshifts @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> most galaxies in the spatially compact group around q  0835 + 580  are consistent with being at the quasar redshift @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> one of these is a candidate very old galaxy without ongoing star formation , while the others appear to have ongoing or recent star formation . </S>",
    "<S> many very and extremely red objects across both fields have @xmath15 , and significant dust is required to fit most of them , including about half of the objects whose fits also require relatively old stellar populations . </S>",
    "<S> large reddenings of @xmath16  @xmath17 are also required to fit four @xmath3 selected eros in the q  1126 + 101  field , though all but one of them have best - fit redshifts @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> these objects may represent a population of dusty high - redshift galaxies underrepresented in optically selected samples .    </S>",
    "<S> taken together , these observations reinforce the claim that radio - loud quasars at @xmath19 can be found in galaxy overdensities . ongoing star formation with moderate amounts of dust seems to be common among all but the very reddest galaxies in these overdensities . </S>"
