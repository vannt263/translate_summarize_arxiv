    "the alice experiment @xcite at the lhc is a dedicated heavy ion experiment with the goal of studying the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .    in heavy - ion collisions with non - zero impact parameter",
    "the fireball exhibits an azimuthal asymmetry with respect to the reaction plane , defined by the azimuth of the impact parameter and the beam direction .",
    "due to collective effects , this initial geometrical anisotropy evolves with time into an asymmetry in momentum space , due to different pressure gradients in - plane and out - of - plane . the final particle azimuthal distribution , therefore , is influenced by the initial geometry .",
    "it can be evaluated via the 2nd coefficient of the fourier expansion of the azimuthal distribution , called elliptic flow ( @xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "the measurement of the heavy flavour particle @xmath0 is sensitive in particular to the degree of thermalization of the system , probing the interaction of heavy quarks , produced in the early stages of the nuclear collision , with the qgp .",
    "the heavy - flavour hadronization mechanism is also investigated @xcite .",
    "some models @xcite predict charm elliptic flow to be smaller than that of light quarks at @xmath4 up to @xmath52 gev/@xmath3 and comparable at higher @xmath4 .",
    "so far , the heavy - quark flow has been measured via non - photonic electrons by the phenix experiment @xcite .",
    "alice can contribute with a direct measurement through the fully reconstructed hadronic decays of d mesons , thanks to its vertex reconstruction , tracking and particle identification capabilities .",
    "the measurement of the elliptic flow is complementary to the measurement of the nuclear modification factor ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "alice measured @xcite a suppression in the d meson yield in pb - pb collisions with respect to pp , rescaled by the number of binary collisions , which probes a strong interaction of charm quarks with the qgp via energy loss mechanism .",
    "although the systematics uncertainties are large , the d mesons suppression is at the same level as that of light charged hadrons .",
    "this analysis is based on about @xmath8 minimum bias events collected during the lhc 2010 pb - pb run .",
    "the trigger was defined as the logical or of the vzero , which consist of two scintillator arrays located at the two sides of the interaction point and on the silicon pixel detector ( spd ) , which is the innermost detector in the central rapidity region .",
    "the centrality is determined via a glauber - model fit of the vzero signal amplitude @xcite .",
    "the centrality class used for this measurement is between 30 and 50% of the pb - pb nuclear cross section .",
    "the first d@xmath9 measurement was performed with event plane methods and 2-particle cumulants @xcite , due to limited statistics .",
    "the analysis strategy consists in the selection of the d@xmath10 candidates ( described in  [ subsec : sigextr ] ) followed by the @xmath0 measurement with the methods mentioned above (  [ subsec : evpl ] , [ subsec : qc ] ) .",
    "the estimation of the systematic uncertainties is described in  [ subsec : syst ] and finally in  [ sec : results ] the results are shown .",
    "a typical signature of the d@xmath11 decay is the presence of two tracks with opposite charges from a secondary vertex pointing the primary vertex and with an invariant mass around the d@xmath1 meson mass ( 1.865 gev ) .",
    "the necessary spatial resolution for the determination of the primary and secondary vertices is assured by the inner tracking system ( its ) and the excellent track resolution is provided by the time projection chamber ( tpc ) and the its . for each pair of tracks",
    "a secondary vertex is defined as their point of closest approach .",
    "the significance of the signal is optimized by selecting track pairs ( _ candidates _ ) that pass specific cuts on the decay length , the angle between the d@xmath1 meson flight line and its reconstructed momentum , and the decay track impact parameter @xcite .",
    "the identification of the kaon rejects additional background , mostly at low @xmath4 .",
    "the identification relies on the specific energy deposit de / dx in the tpc and on the time of flight of the particle measured by the time of flight detector ( tof ) .",
    "the event plane methods correlate each candidate s azimuthal angle ( @xmath12 ) with the reaction plane angle ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the reaction plane is estimated through the event plane @xmath14 determined by the so - called q - vector which is a weighted sum of the azimuthal angles of all the tpc tracks in @xmath15 with quality requirements including 70 clusters in the tpc and a @xmath16 . to remove autocorrelation , the tracks coming from the @xmath17 candidate under study",
    "are subtracted from the q - vector .",
    "the @xmath18 is used for this analysis : @xmath19 in our case , the @xmath20 are @xmath12-weights determined on a run - by - run basis .",
    "the precision on the measured event plane is limited by the finite number of reconstructed tracks .",
    "the resolution on @xmath18 was estimated with the two sub - events method @xcite and the resulting correction factor @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , to be applied to the observed @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , is 0.91 .",
    "the three methods used to extract the @xmath25 in 3 bins of @xmath4 are described in the following sub - sections .",
    "the first method consists in comparing the signal yield in bins of @xmath26 .",
    "the signal is extracted with an invariant mass analysis .",
    "two ranges of @xmath27 are defined : @xmath28 , which gives the in - plane yield ( @xmath29 ) and @xmath30 , which gives the out - of - plane yield ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the yield is extracted from the subtraction of the background below the exponential fit function from the total fit , in a region of @xmath32 around the mean of the gaussian fit ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2dmeth1 ] , left panel ) . integrating the fourier expansion in the two @xmath27 ranges , @xmath23 can be expressed as : @xmath33      the @xmath34 distribution of d@xmath1 candidates in three mass ranges",
