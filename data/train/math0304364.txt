    "-5 mm    aging is an interesting long - time property of dynamics in complex disordered media , and in particular in certain random media .",
    "a system ages when its decorrelation properties are age - dependent : the older the system the longer it takes to forget its past .",
    "aging has been heavily studied both experimentally , numerically and theoretically by physicists , in particular in the context of spin - glass dynamics , but the mathematical litterature is still rather sparse .",
    "our interest in aging stemmed from the study of dynamics of mean field spin glasses models , and more precisely of langevin dynamics for the sherrington kirkpatrick model .",
    "this remains the ultimate goal , far from being achievable .",
    "but we will survey some of the partial progress which has been made both in short time scales ( for the spherical sk model , see section 4 ) or much longer time scales ( for the rem dynamics , see section 3 ) .",
    "we begin with aging the bouchaud trap model on various graphs ( see section 2)even though it is not directly related to spin glasses , because the mechanism of aging there is close to the one for the rem .",
    "this talk is based on joint works with a.bovier , j.cerny , a.dembo , v.gayrard , a.guionnet , as well as works by c.newman , r.fontes , m.isopi .",
    "-5 mm    this model is simple model of a random walk trapped ( or rather slowed down ) by random wells .",
    "it is nevertheless quite rich .",
    "it has been introduced by bouchaud and coworkers ( see [ 9 ] for a beautiful general survey ) as an ansatz to understand  activated \" dynamics of spin glasses .",
    "-5 mm    consider @xmath0 a graph where @xmath1 is the set of vertices and @xmath2 the set of bonds .",
    "we introduce a  random energy landscape \" on @xmath1 , a collection @xmath3 of i.i.d non - negative random variables , indexed by the vertices of the graph and exponentially distributed ( with mean one ) , i.e @xmath4 from these random variables , we define a random measure @xmath5 on @xmath1 by : @xmath6 here @xmath7 is an inverse temperature parameter",
    ". we will denote by @xmath8 and concentrate on the low temperature phase , i.e @xmath9 .",
    "the physicists would see the set of vertices @xmath1 as a set of  favourable valleys \" for the configurations of a much more complex system ( for instance a spin - glass ) , @xmath10 as the energy of the bottom of the valley @xmath11 .",
    "since these energies are usually the extreme values of some other random landscape ( see below the discussion about the rem ) , the hypothesis that they are exponential random variables is reasonable .",
    "the sites @xmath11 where @xmath12 is large are seen as  very favourable valleys \" , or equivalently as very deep traps , where the system should stay for a long time , in any sensible definition of the dynamics .      -5 mm    we consider the continuous - time markov chain @xmath13 on the set @xmath1 of vertices , whose jump rates are given , when @xmath11 and @xmath14 are neighbours on the graph , by : @xmath15 and @xmath16 if @xmath11 and @xmath14 are not neighbours .",
    "here @xmath17 is a time - scale parameter , often set to 1 , and @xmath18 $ ] is a symmetry index .",
    "one can also write @xmath19    these jump rates satisfy the detailed balance equation : @xmath20    so that the measure @xmath5 is reversible for the markov chain @xmath21 , whatever the value of the parameter a.    notice nevertheless that the case where @xmath22 is simpler . then the jump rate @xmath23 depends only on the random landscape at site @xmath11 . the markov chain @xmath21 is simply obtained by a random time - change from the simple random walk on the graph .",
    "this case is always easier to handle , and will be called the random hopping times dynamics ( rht dynamics ) . in this case",
    ", @xmath24 is simply the mean time spent at @xmath11 .    * remark * the important feature of the random variables @xmath25 is the fact that they are heavy - tailed : @xmath26 in particular their expectation is infinite , when @xmath27 .",
    "the whole model could in fact be directly defined in terms of the @xmath24 rather than from the energies @xmath28 , and then one could assume that the @xmath24 are i.i.d and in the domain of attraction of an @xmath29-stable law .",
    "-5 mm    the natural question about bouchaud s markov chain is to study its long - time behaviour , either in the  quenched \" regime , i.e almost surely in the randomness of the energy landscape , or in the  annealed \" regime , i.e after averaging in this randomness .",
    "one would expect a dynamical phase transition , between the high temperature phase where @xmath30 and the low temperature phase where @xmath27 .",
    "a general idea about the low temperature phase is that the system spends most of its time in very deep traps : more precisely , that by time t , the chain has explored a large part of the space and has found traps of depth depending on t. so that , at age t , with high probability the system sits waiting in a deep trap , whose depth is t - dependent , for a time thus depending on t , before being able to get out and find another deep trap .",
    "the beautiful idea put forward by the physics litterature is  to think in the two - times plane \" , i.e to consider the evolution of the system between two large times , generally denoted @xmath31 ( like waiting time , @xmath31 is the age of the system ) and @xmath32 ( t is then the duration of the observation of the system ) , and to let both @xmath31 and t tend to infinity . the next step proposed by physicists is to choose appropriate two - point functions , i.e functions of the evolution of the system in the time interval ( @xmath31 , @xmath33 ) , in order to measure how much the system forgets its past in this time interval .",
    "the simplest such two - point function is the quenched probability that the system is in the same state at times @xmath31 and @xmath33 : @xmath34 here the probability is quenched , i.e conditioned on the random medium , and the superscript @xmath35 denotes this randomness of medium , i.e the i.i.d collection of energies .",
    "one will also consider the annealed version of this two - point function : @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the expectation w.r.t the medium .",
    "one also considers often another two - point function , i.e the quenched probability that the system has not jumped at all in the time interval ( @xmath31 , @xmath33 ) : @xmath38 or its annealed conterpart @xmath39    finding an  agime regime \" is then proving that when t is too small as a function of @xmath31 ( typically @xmath40 for some  aging exponent \" @xmath41 ) , then such a two - point function is close to one , and when it is large enough ( typically @xmath42 ) it is close to zero .",
    "naturally it is even more desirable to find the limit of these two - point functions for the critical regime ( typically @xmath43 ) .",
    "this program is now understood rigorously for a few important graphs , which we will now review .",
    "we will review the case of @xmath44 , first for @xmath45 after the work of fontes - isopi - newman ( [ 16],[17])and more recently cerny ( see [ 4],[14 ] ) , then the case of @xmath46 ( see [ 5 ] ) ( for @xmath47 see [ 14 ] ) .",
    "then we treat the case of the complete graph on @xmath48 points when @xmath48 tends to infinity .",
    "this is in fact the original bouchaud model , which was introduced as an ansatz for the dynamics of the random energy model .",
    "we will then survey the recent results on these dynamics of the rem ( [ 1],[2],[3 ] ) which will be the first results really pertaining to the topic of spin glass dynamics .",
    "-5 mm    bouchaud s model on @xmath49 has been first studied by fontes - isopi - newman , when @xmath22 , i.e for the random hopping times dynamics . to understand aging in dimension @xmath45 , it is important to introduce a limiting object which will play the role of the random medium :    the random speed measure @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath51 be a poisson point process on @xmath52 , with intensity measure @xmath53 .",
    "we define a random measure @xmath50 on @xmath54 by @xmath55    the fin ( fontes - isopi - newman ) singular diffusion @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath57 be a standard one - dimensional brownian motion , and l(@xmath58,@xmath14 ) its local time at @xmath14 .",
    "define the random time - change : @xmath59 and its inverse @xmath60 then the fin singular diffusion is @xmath61    notice that the random speed measure and the fin singular diffusion are entirely independent of the symmetry parameter @xmath62 , but depend only on the temperature parameter @xmath29 .",
    "then the following ( annealed ) aging result has been proved in [ 16 ] for @xmath22 , and in [ 4 ] for general a s .",
    "for any @xmath27 and any @xmath18 $ ] , the following limit exists @xmath63 moreover the function f can be computed using the singular diffusion @xmath49 :",
    "@xmath64    this result shows that the two - point function @xmath54 exhibits an aging regime , @xmath65 , independently of @xmath62 . to be able to feel the influence of @xmath62",
    ", one should use the other ( annealed ) two - point function @xmath66 , which exhibits another aging regime ( see [ 4 ] ) .",
    "let us introduce some notation : denote by @xmath67 the annealed distribution function of the important r.v @xmath68 @xmath69 here the brackets denote the average w.r.t the environment i.e the randomness of the measure @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath70 be the laplace transform of the r.v @xmath71 @xmath72\\ ] ] and @xmath73 the constant given by @xmath74^{1-a}.$ ]    for any @xmath27 and any @xmath18 $ ] , the following limit exists @xmath75 where @xmath76 and this limit can be computed explicitly @xmath77 in particular , when @xmath22 , @xmath78    these two results show that the markov chain essentially succeeds in leaving the site it has reached at age @xmath31 only after a time @xmath58 of the order of @xmath79 , but that for time scales between @xmath79 and @xmath31 it will jump out of the site reached at age @xmath31 but will not find an other trap deep enough and so will be attracted back to the trap it reached at age @xmath31 .",
    "-5 mm    in dimension 2 , i.e on @xmath80 , the only case studied is the case where a=0 , the rht case .",
    "an aging regime is exibited ( in [ 5])for both quenched two - point functions    the following limits exists almost surely in the environment @xmath35 , @xmath81 @xmath82    the functions h and k satisfy @xmath83 and @xmath84    in fact the functions @xmath85 and @xmath86 can be computed explicitly easily using arcsine laws for stable processes .",
    "for instance @xmath87    here again there is a difference between the subaging regime ( i.e @xmath88for @xmath66))and aging regime(i.e @xmath89 for r ) , but much slighter than in dimension 1 .",
    "indeed it is naturally much more difficult to visit a trap again after leaving it .",
    "there is another important difference between @xmath90=1 and @xmath90=2 , noticed by [ 16 ] , namely there is localisation in dimension 1 and not in dimension 2 .",
    "more precisely , in @xmath90=1 @xmath91 and this property is wrong in dimension 2 .",
    "-5 mm    consider now the case where @xmath92 is the complete graph on @xmath48 points .",
    "we will also study here only the case the rht case , where @xmath62=0 .",
    "we consider bouchaud s markov chain @xmath21 on @xmath92 , started from the uniform measure .",
    "then it is easy to see that the times of jump form a renewal process and that the two - point function @xmath93 is the solution of a renewal equation .",
    "this renewal process converges , when @xmath48 tends to @xmath94 , to a heavy - tailed renewal process we now introduce .",
    "let @xmath95 consider @xmath96 the unique solution of the renewal equation @xmath97    ( see [ 10 ] , [ 3 ] ) almost surely in the environment , for all @xmath31 and t , @xmath98 converges to @xmath99    it is easy to see that the limiting two - point function @xmath96 shows aging .",
    "let @xmath100 obviously @xmath101 when @xmath102 tends to 0 , and @xmath103 when @xmath102 tends to @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath104 so that @xmath105",
    "we will see in the next section how this simple result gives an approximation ( in a weak sense ) for the much more complex problem of aging for the rht dynamics for the rem .",
    "-5 mm    we report here on the joint work with anton bovier and veronique gayrard , see [ 1],[2 ] , [ 3 ] .",
    "this work uses heavily the general analysis of metastability for disordered mean - field models in [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] .",
    "let us first , following derrida , define the rem , often called the simplest model of a spin glass .",
    "a spin configuration @xmath106 is a vertex of the hypercube @xmath107 . as in bouchaud model on the graph @xmath108 we consider a collection of i.i.d random variables @xmath109 indexed by the vertices of @xmath110 .",
    "but we will here assume that the distribution of the @xmath111 s is standard gaussian .",
    "we then define the gibbs measure @xmath112 on @xmath110 by setting : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the normalizing partition function .",
    "the statics of this model are well understood ( see[15 ] , and [ 13 ] ) .",
    "it is well known that the rem exhibits a static phase transition at @xmath115 . for @xmath116",
    "the gibbs measure gives , asymptotically when @xmath117 tends to @xmath94 , positive mass to the configurations @xmath106 where the extreme values of the order statistics of the i.i.d @xmath118 sample @xmath119 are reached , i.e if we order the spin configurations according to the magnitude of their ( - ) energies : @xmath120    then for any fixed @xmath86 , the mass @xmath121 will converge to some positive random variable .",
    "in fact the whole collection of masses @xmath122 will converge to a point process , called ruelle s point process .",
    "consider for any @xmath123 , the set ( which we have called the top in [ 2 ] and [ 3 ] , and should really be called the bottom ) of configurations with energies below a certain threshold @xmath124 .",
    "@xmath125 we will choose here the natural threshold for extreme of standard gaussian i.i.d rv s , i.e @xmath126 now we define discrete - time dynamics on @xmath110 by the transition probabilities @xmath127 notice we have here truncated the negative values of the @xmath111 s , this truncation is technical and irrelevant .",
    "we could truncate much less drastically .",
    "anyway the states with very negative @xmath123 s wo nt be seen on the time scales we are interested in .",
    "then the idea defended by bouchaud is that the motion of these rem dynamics when seen only on the deepest traps @xmath128 should be close to the dynamics of the bouchaud model on the complete graph for large @xmath48 . this is true only to some extent .",
    "it is true that , if one conditions on the size of the top @xmath129 to be @xmath48 , then the sequence of visited points in @xmath129 has asymptotically , when @xmath117 tends to @xmath94 , to the standard random walk on the complete graph with @xmath48 points .",
    "nevertheless bouchaud s picture would be completely correct if the process observed on the top would really be markovian , which is not the case , due to a lack of time scales separation between the top and its complement .",
    "nevertheless it is remarkable that in a weak asymptotic form bouchaud s prediction about aging is correct .",
    "let us consider the following natural two - point function : @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the quenched probability that the process starting at time 0 in state @xmath106 does not jump during the time interval @xmath132 from one state in the top @xmath129 to another such state .",
    "let @xmath133 then there is a sequence @xmath134 , such that for any @xmath135 @xmath136    the rescaling of the time by the factor @xmath137 shows that bouchaud s trap model is a good approximation of the rem dynamics for the very large time asymptotics , on the last time scale before equilibrium is reached .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the other model of glassy dynamics for spin glasses , as advocated by parisi , mezard or cugliandolo - kurchan where the infinite volume limit is taken before the large time limit .",
    "we will see in the next section an example of such a very different aging phenomenon in a much shorter time - scale .",
    "the rem is the first model on which this study of aging on very long times scales ( activated dynamics)has been rigorously achieved .",
    "this phenomenon should be present in many more models , like the generalized random energy model , which is the next achievable goal , or even in much harder problems like the p - spin models for large enough p s .",
    "the tools developped in [ 11][12 ] should be of prime relevance .",
    "-5 mm    studying spin glass dynamics for the sherrington kirkpatrick model might seem premature , since statics are notoriously far from fully understood , as opposed to the rem .",
    "nevertheless , following sompolinski and zippelius , a mathematical study of the langevin dynamics has been undertaken in the recent years jointly with a.guionnet ( see [ 7],[8],[19 ] ) .",
    "the output of this line of research has been to prove convergence and large deviation results for the empirical measure on path space as well as averaged and quenched propagation of chaos .",
    "the same problem has been solved by @xmath48 .",
    "grunwald for discrete spins and glauber dynamics , see [ 18 ] .",
    "the law of the limiting dynamics ( the self consistent single spin dynamics ) is characterized in various equivalent ways , from a variational problem to a non - markovian implicit stochastic differential equation , none of which being yet amenable , for the moment , to a serious understanding .    the sherrington - kirkpatrick hamiltonian is given by @xmath138 with a @xmath139 random matrix @xmath140 of centered i.i.d standard gaussian random variables .",
    "the langevin dynamics for this model are described by the stochastic differential system :      where @xmath2 is a @xmath117-dimensional brownian motion , and u a smooth potential growing fast enough to infinity .",
    "it was proved in [ 8],[19 ] that , for any time @xmath142 , the empirical measure on path space @xmath143}}\\ ] ] converges almost surely towards a non markovian limit law @xmath144 , when the initial condition is a  deep quench \" , i.e when @xmath145 are i.i.d .",
    "@xmath144 is called the self consistent single spin dynamics in the physics litterature .",
    "it is the law of a self - consistent non markovian process , which is very hard to study .",
    "one expects that the long time behaviour of this process shows an interesting dynamical phase transition , and in particular exhibits aging .",
    "a consequence of the convergence stated above is that the limit of the empirical covariance exists , and is simply the autocovariance of the law @xmath144 : @xmath146    unfortunately it is not possible to find a simple , autonomous equation satisfied by c , or even by c and the so - called response function r. this is a very hard open problem .",
    "but in the physics litterature ( mainly in the work of cugliandolo and kurchan ) one find that the same program is tractable and gives a very rich picture of aging for a large class of models , i.e the spherical p - spin models .",
    "we report here on the joint work with a.dembo and a.guionnet [ 6 ] , on the simplest of such models , i.e the spherical sk , or spherical p - spin model with p=2 .",
    "the general case of @xmath147 is harder and will be our next step in the near future . in this work",
    ", we study the langevin dynamics for a spherical version of the sherrington kirkpatrick ( ssk ) spin glass model .",
    "more precisely , we shall consider the following stochastic differential system @xmath148 where @xmath149 is a uniformly lipschitz , bounded below function on @xmath150 such that @xmath151 as @xmath152 and @xmath153 is an @xmath117-dimensional brownian motion , independent of @xmath154 and of the initial data @xmath155 .      here again",
    "the empirical covariance admits a limit @xmath157 but now , as opposed to the true sk model , this limiting two point function is easily computable from an autonomous renewal equation .",
    "indeed the induced rotational symmetry of the spherical model reduces the dynamics in question to an @xmath117-dimensional coupled system of ornstein - uhlenbeck processes whose random drift parameters are the eigenvalues of a goe random matrices .            in these much shorter time scales",
    "than for the former sections , the aging phenomenon we exhibit here is quite different than the one shown in the rem . here",
    "the system has no time to cross any barrier , or to explore and find deep wells , it simply goes down one well , in very high dimension . in some of these very many directions ( corresponding to the top eigenvectors of the random matrix",
    "* j * ) , the curvature of the well is so weak that the corresponding coordinates of the system are not tightly bound and are very slow to equilibrate .",
    "these very slow components are responsible for the aging phenomenon here .",
