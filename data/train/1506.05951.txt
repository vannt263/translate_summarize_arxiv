    "the hypercentral constituent quark model ( hcqm ) has been introduced @xcite in order to describe the internal structure of baryons and their electromagnetic properties .",
    "after having fixed the few free parameters by fitting the observed spectrum of baryon resonances , the model has been used to predict many baryon properties , such as the photocouplings @xcite , the helicity amplitudes for the transverse excitation of negative parity resonances @xcite and the nucleon elastic form factors @xcite .",
    "recently the predicted transverse and longitudinal helicity amplitudes up to @xmath0 for both proton and neutron have been published @xcite . in this paper , after a brief description of the model , the attention will be concentrated on the results regarding the excitation of some of the most important resonances and then future perspectives , mainly in connection with the inclusion of relativistic effects , will be discussed .",
    "n the hcqm the three quark hamiltonian is assumed to be @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the momenta conjugated to the coordinates @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the hyperfine interaction @xcite and x is the hyperradius , defined as @xmath6 .    the spin independent part is assumed to depend on the hyperradius @xmath7 only , that is to be hypercentral .",
    "this assumption is supported by the fact that two - body potentials , when applied to baryons , behave approximately as a hypercentral one @xcite . in this sense",

    "( [ hcqm ] ) can be considered as the hypercenral approximation of a two - body potential of the form suggested by lattice qcd calculations @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a hypercentral potential may contain contributions from three - body forces , which have been taken into account also in the calculations by ref .",
    "@xcite and in the relativized version of the isgur - karl model @xcite .",
    "having fixed the quark mass @xmath8 to @xmath9 of the nucleon mass and the strength of the hyperfine interaction in order to reproduce the @xmath10 - nucleon mass difference , the remaining parameters are fitted to the spectrum and are given by @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite .",

    "the electromagnetic transition amplitudes , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , are defined as the matrix elements of the quark electromagnetic interaction , @xmath18 , between the nucleon , @xmath19 , and the resonance , @xmath20 , states : @xmath21 @xmath22 is the electromagnetic current carried by quarks and will be used in its non relativistic form @xcite ; @xmath23 is the photon momentum in the breit frame .",
    "the results for the photocouplings , that is the transverse amplitudes with zero photon tetramomentum ( @xmath24 ) compare favourably with other model @xcite .",
    "the overall trend is reproduced , but as in all models , there is a lack of strength .    a systematic calculation of the helicity amplitudes for the transverse and longitudinal excitation to 14 resonances of both proton and neutron has been recently reported @xcite . for many resonances",
    "there are still few data , however , thanks to the recent jlab experiments at higher @xmath13 , one can make a significant comparison between the extracted amplitudes and the hcqm predictions . as an example , in fig .",
    "( [ fig-1 ] ) the transverse helicity amplitudes for the proton excitation to the n(1520 ) @xmath25 resonance are given .",
    "it should be mentioned that the predictions for the transverse excitation to the negative parity states had been published @xcite before the appearance of the new jlab data .",
    "apart from the low @xmath13 region , where there is the already quoted missing strength , the overall behaviour is in general fairly reproduced , specially for the 1/2 amplitudes .",
    "the discrepancy at low @xmath13 is attributed to the missing quark - antiquark pair or meson production mechanisms @xcite .",
    "actually , the calculation of the meson cloud effects in the dmt model @xcite show that their contribution is relevant for low @xmath13 , just in the region where the hcqm fails to reproduce the strength @xcite .",
    "the data mainly concern the proton excitation , however there are now analyses which succeed in extracting the neutron photocouplings @xcite . in table",

    "it is possible to introduce relativistic corrections to the hcqm calculations for the nucleon elastic form factors @xcite and the helicity ampltudes @xcite .",
    "the relativistic corrections modify only slightly the helicity amplitudes @xcite , apart from the case of the @xmath10 excitation , and do not explain the missing strength at low @xmath13",
    ". on the contrary , they are very important for the elastic form factors @xcite .    for this reason",
    "the hcqm has been reformulated in a relativistically consistent framework using the point form formulation of the dirac relativistic dynamics @xcite and has been applied to the calculation of the elastic nucleon form factors @xcite and the predicted values are very near to the experimental data ; a further improvement is obtained if quark form factors are introduced @xcite , in particular for the ratio @xmath27 .    for consistency ,",
    "a programme for the calculation of the helicity amplitudes in the relativistic hcqm has been started , the preliminary results for the @xmath10 excitation show that the relativistic are , as expected , very important and bring the predictions quite near to the experimental data @xcite .",
    "another important issue in connection with relativity is that of the meson cloud effects .",
    "to thos end one has to introduce in a consistent way the quark - antiquark pair creation mechanism into the cqm , that is one gas to unquench the quark model , similarly to what happens in lqcd .",
    "the unquenching of the quark model for the meson sector has been performed long go @xcite , but only recently it has been obtained also for the baryon sector @xcite .",
    "this new formulation is an important breakthrough for cqms , in particular it will allow to take properly into account the coupling with the continuum and predict a non zero width for the baryon resonances .",
    "it has been shown that the unquenched cqm ( u**???**cqm ) does not modify the old good results for the magnetic moments and that it gives important results for the spin proton problem , the flavour asymmetry of sea quarks @xcite and the problem if the strangeness content of baryons @xcite .    to conclude , the hcqm is a useful tool for a consistent description of various electromagnetic properties and",
