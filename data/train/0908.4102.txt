    "observations of type ia supernovae@xcite , along with the usual assumption that the universe is homogeneous , indicate that the expansion of the universe is accelerating . this acceleration necessitates the presence of an exotic form of matter called dark energy , which can most easily be accounted for by a cosmological constant .",
    "however , because the scale of the cosmological constant is so small ( @xmath0 in planck units ) it is natural to look for alternative explanations for the data .",
    "one such alternative explanation is to account for the supernova data using a comsmological model that is inhomogeneous.@xcite the simplest such models are the lematre - tolman - bondi(ltb ) spacetimes.@xcite these are spherically symmetric spacetimes with pressureless fluid ( dust ) as the matter .",
    "models of this form can be constructed that account for the supernova data as well as the standard homogeneous `` concordance '' cosmology does.@xcite thus to test the difference between concordance cosmology and inhomogeneous cosmology , a different test is needed .",
    "such a test is provided by the kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich ( ksz ) effect.@xcite this effect comes about when cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons scatter off the gas in a galaxy cluster .",
    "the spectrum of the scattered photons depends on the velocity of the galaxy cluster with respect to the microwave background , and thus an analysis of the cmb can be used to find this velocity .",
    "thus , each ltb model must be compared not only to the supernova data but also to the ksz data , and only those models that match both sets of data can be considered viable .",
    "analyses of the ksz effect for particular ltb models have been performed@xcite as well as a general analysis for slightly inhomogeneous models.@xcite unfortunately , each ltb model is different , and so each must be seperately subjected to the ksz test ( as well as the supernova test ) to see if that model is viable . in this paper we will present a general method for finding the velocity of galaxy clusters in ltb models",
    ". we will then apply this method to the models treated in@xcite .",
    "section 2 presents the general method of calculating these velocities .",
    "section 3 applies this method to the models of@xcite .",
    "conclusions are presented in section 4 .",
    "the metric in the ltb spacetimes takes the form @xmath1 here the area radius @xmath2 is not one of the coordinates but is instead a function of the coordinates @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the function @xmath5 is a function of @xmath4 .",
    "an overdot denotes derivative with respect to @xmath3 while a prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "the ltb spacetime has a prefered timelike vector @xmath6 which is the four - velocity of the dust that makes up the matter in the spacetime .",
    "however , an ltb spacetime with a cosmic microwave background has another prefered vector , which we will call @xmath7 , the four - velocity of the cmb .",
    "since the spacetime is spherically symmetric , there is also a preferred unit spacelike vector @xmath8 such that @xmath9 is an outgoing null vector and @xmath10 is an ingoing null vector .",
    "expressed in terms of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the ltb four - velocity @xmath11 takes the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the velocity of the ltb observer with respect to the cmb and where @xmath14 .",
    "now let @xmath15 and @xmath16 be respectively ingoing and outgoing cmb photons each with the same frequency @xmath17 as measured in the cmb rest frame .",
    "then it follows that these vectors take the form @xmath18 now define the quantity @xmath19 by @xmath20 then it follows that @xmath21 we restrict attention to times when the cmb has decoupled from the matter , so that @xmath22 are null geodesics . thus , to find the velocity of the galaxies with respect to the cmb",
    ", we need to find the behavior of null geodesics in ltb spacetimes .    to find the behavior of null geodesics ,",
    "we first recall some facts about the ltb spacetimes . from the einstein field equation",
    ", it follows that @xmath23 where the function @xmath24 depends only on @xmath4 .",
    "the density is given by @xmath25 it is helpful to introduce the quantities @xmath26 and @xmath27 by @xmath28 then equation ( [ rdot ] ) becomes @xmath29 whose solution is @xmath30 here @xmath31 is a function of @xmath4 whose meaning is the time at which the shell of dust with coordinate @xmath4 shrinks to zero radius . to have a genuine big bang singularity , we chose @xmath32 .",
    "we use the coordinate freedom to change @xmath4 to any function of @xmath4 to set @xmath27 to the constant @xmath33 . with this choice , the particular ltb model",
    "is then determined by the choice of the function @xmath34 .",
    "in particular , when @xmath35 the ltb solution becomes the standard dust frw cosmology with @xmath36 .    for any future directed null geodesic @xmath37 define the quantity @xmath38 .",
    "then it follows that @xmath39 where @xmath40 where @xmath41 and the sign of @xmath42 depends on whether @xmath37 is outgoing or ingoing .",
    "note from the definition of @xmath43 that @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the @xmath43 corresponding to @xmath16 and correspondingly for @xmath46 .",
    "it follows from the form of the ltb metric that @xmath47 then using the geodesic equation we find @xmath48 from which it follows that @xmath49 + \\epsilon { \\sqrt { 1+f } } { a ' } ) \\label{main}\\ ] ]    we will use equation ( [ main ] ) to find the velocity @xmath13 of the dust relative to the cmb as follows : note that since we have chosen @xmath32 it follows that at early times the spacetimes becomes frw .",
    "note also that in frw spacetimes @xmath50 and therefore @xmath43 is constant . for cmb photons with the average energy this constant , which we will call @xmath51 is the same for outgoing and ingoing photons .",
    "integrating equation ( [ main ] ) back from the point at which we want to calculate @xmath13 to the big bang yields @xmath52 and since we do this for both outgoing and ingoing geodesics , we obtain both @xmath53 and @xmath54 which in turn allows us to calculate @xmath55 and thus the velocity @xmath13",
    ".    we will numerically integrate equation ( [ main ] ) .",
    "however , in order to do that we will need to be able to evaluate all the quantities on the right hand side of that equation at all points in the integration . as we will show , all that is needed is to know @xmath2 and @xmath56 and the rest of the quantities follow .",
    "however , @xmath2 and @xmath56 also change as the integration procedes , so we need to know how they change . from equation([elldef ] ) we find @xmath57 note that an ingoing geodesic that goes through @xmath58 becomes an outgoing geodesic , where this change is implemented as a change in the sign of @xmath42 .",
    "we must evolve the system of equations ( [ main]-[evolvea ] ) . to do this",
    ", we must be able to evaluate all quantities on the right hand sides of these equations from just @xmath2 and @xmath56 , that is , we must be able to find @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "given @xmath2 and @xmath56 we obtain @xmath61 and thus we find all specified functions of @xmath4 such as @xmath62 and @xmath5 . from equation ( [ adotsquared ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath63 which then yields @xmath64 since @xmath65 . differentiating equation ( [ timediff ] ) with respect to @xmath4 and solving for @xmath66 yields @xmath67 where @xmath68\\ ] ] with @xmath69 .",
    "this then yields @xmath70 through @xmath71 .",
    "finally , differentiating equation ( [ adot ] ) with respect to @xmath4 yields @xmath72 which in turn yields @xmath60 through @xmath73",
    ".    what remains is then simply to find the initial values of @xmath2 and @xmath56 for each point in our past light cone , along with the coresponding values of the redshift @xmath74 .",
    "as shown in @xcite this can be done by integrating equations ( [ evolver]-[evolvea ] ) from our current position , along with the evolution equation for the redshift @xmath75 for this integration , the initial value of @xmath2 is zero , while the initial value of @xmath56 is given by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the ratio of the density in matter to the critical density .",
    "in the models of @xcite a choice of @xmath77 is made , and the function @xmath62 takes the form @xmath78 where the constant @xmath79 is chosen for best fit with the supernova data . in particular , the two models considered are ( i ) @xmath80 , which gives rise to @xmath81 , and ( ii ) @xmath82 , which gives rise to @xmath83 .",
    "each of these models fits the supernova data about as well as the standard concordance cosmology . because @xmath84 at large @xmath4 , these models are asymptotically @xmath85 frw cosmologies with an underdensity in a region near the center",
    "note that the large value of @xmath79 means that in these models we live in an underdensity of fairly small size .",
    "using the method of the previous section , we calculate the velocity of the dust with respect to the cmb for each point on our past light cone .",
    "the results are shown in figures ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . here",
    "figure ( 1 ) is for the @xmath86 model and figure ( 2 ) is for the @xmath87 model .",
    "also plotted on the figures are the results of observations of the ksz effect for galaxy clusters.@xcite    plot of velocity ( in units of km / s ) _ vs _ redshift for the @xmath88 ltb model ]    plot of velocity ( in units of km / s ) _ vs _ redshift for the @xmath89 ltb model ]    the observations clearly rule out the @xmath89 model .",
    "in addition , the @xmath88 model does not provide a good fit to the observations , so this model may also be ruled out .",
    "any successful ltb model must pass both the supernova test and the ksz test .",
    "together these tests provide a powerful constraint that rules out the models of @xcite .",
    "however , the models of @xcite were chosen on the basis of simplicity and fitting the supernova test ; so it is not surprising that one additional test suffices to rule them out .",
    "it is therefore possible that reasonable ltb models could be made that have fair agreement with both the supernova data and the ksz data .",
    "however , as ksz measurements improve in accuracy , this test will become more stringent and might eventually rule out all ltb models .",
    "i would like to thank nick kaiser and juan garcia - bellido for helpful discussions .",
