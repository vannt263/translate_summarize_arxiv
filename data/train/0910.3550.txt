    "measurements of diboson production cross sections at the tevatron test the electroweak sector of the standard model and have been used to place limits on models of physics beyond the standard model  @xcite .",
    "diboson measurements are also useful in the context of searches for the standard model higgs boson at the tevatron . in this presentation",
    "we focus on recent diboson results that are relevant to the higgs searches .    the search for the higgs boson at the tevatron involves searching for a very small signal in overwhelming backgrounds .",
    "sophisticated analysis techniques are often used to exploit small differences between signal and background events .",
    "the searches also gain power from increasing signal acceptance and dividing events into several regions depending on their signal - to - background ratios .",
    "some of the diboson searches and measurements presented below take advantage of similar techniques while others use somewhat simpler strategies .",
    "comparison of the results derived with different techniques is a useful test of the analysis strategies employed in the higgs searches .",
    "the measurements presented here are performed in @xmath4 collision data with @xmath3  tev collected by either the cdf ii or detector .",
    "the detectors are described in detail elsewhere  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 production have all been observed at the tevatron at the 5@xmath5 level in events where both bosons decay leptonically",
    ". table  [ tab : lep_sum ] shows recent measurements of the cross sections for each of the two experiments .",
    "the measured cross sections agree well between the two experiments and with the standard model predictions .",
    "the observation of @xmath2 production and the measurement of the @xmath0 production cross section are discussed in more detail below .",
    ".[tab : lep_sum]summary of diboson cross sections measured in leptonic channels at the cdf and detectors . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]      cdf reported the first observation of diboson production where one boson decays to leptons and the other to hadrons  @xcite in 3.5 @xmath7 .",
    "events with very large missing transverse energy ( @xmath860 gev ) and exactly two jets were used for this observation .",
    "no veto on events with a lepton in the final state was imposed .",
    "the analysis was therefore sensitive to a sum of @xmath9 , and @xmath2 processes .",
    "one challenge in this channel was understanding the qcd multi - jet background ( mjb ) .",
    "an event with many jets can have large fake @xmath10 because of mismeasurement of the jet energies , often stemming from instrumental effects , making this background difficult to model .",
    "the size of the mjb background was significantly reduced by imposing cuts on the @xmath10 significance and the angle between the @xmath10 and the jets .",
    "the remaining mjb was modeled with a data sample enriched in multi - jet events , selected by finding events with a large difference in direction between their track - based missing transverse momentum and their calorimeter - based missing transvere energy .",
    "the second large background stemmed from electroweak processes ( @xmath11+jets , @xmath12+jets , and @xmath13-quark production ) .",
    "these backgrounds were modeled using monte carlo .",
    "the uncertainty on the model was evaluated with data , using @xmath14jet events .",
    "the signal cross section was extracted by a fit to the dijet mass spectrum with signal and background templates .",
    "the fit is shown in figure  [ fig : metjets_cdf ] .",
    "the fitted cross section was found to be @xmath15(stat)@xmath16(syst)@xmath17(lumi ) , with the dominant systematic uncertainty due to the jet energy scale .",
    "the signal was observed with a significance of 5.3@xmath5 .",
    "fit to mass dijet mass distribution to extract @xmath18 cross section in events with large missing transverse energy and two jets.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]      the first evidence of @xmath20 was reported by the collaboration  @xcite in 1.07 @xmath7 .",
    "events with a well - identified electron or muon , at least two jets , and @xmath820 gev were selected .",
    "the background due to qcd multi - jet events was reduced by requiring the transverse mass of the lepton-@xmath10 system to be larger than 35 gev .",
    "the remaining backgrounds were dominated by @xmath11+jets production , with some qcd multi - jet , @xmath12+jets , and top quark production contributing as well .",
    "the qcd multijet background was modeled using data with somewhat loosened lepton requirements .",
    "the @xmath11+jets background was modeled with simulated events from algpen interfaced with the pythia parton shower .",
    "the modeling of the @xmath11+jets background was critical to the analysis , so careful comparison between data and monte carlo was carried out .",
    "discrepancies in the jet @xmath21 distributions and the @xmath22 distributions were observed ; the models were reweighted to agree with data .",
    "once confident in the modeling , a random forest classifier ( rf ) was used to discriminate between signal and background events .",
    "several kinematic variables , such as the dijet mass , were used as inputs and the rf was trained on part of the background to build a classification for each event .",
    "the distribution of the rf output observed in data was fitted to a sum of predicted rf templates to extract the signal significance and cross section .",
    "the fit is shown in figure  [ fig : wwwz_d0 ] .",
    "the measured cross section is @xmath23 pb , with dominant systematic uncertainties from the modeling of the @xmath11+jets background distribution and the jet energy scale .",
    "the significance of the observed signal is 4.4@xmath5 .",
    "fit to random forest classifier output used to extract the @xmath20 cross section.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the same analysis was carried out using only the dijet mass distribution rather than the random forest classifier output .",
    "since less information about the event is used , the measurement is expected to be less precise .",
    "the dijet mass is shown in figure  [ fig : wwwz_d0_mjj ] .",
    "the result of the fit was @xmath24 , compatible with the result from the rf classifier .",
    "dijet mass distribution for data , backgrounds , and expected @xmath25 signal in @xmath26 final state.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]      the first observation of @xmath20 was presented by cdf in 2.7 @xmath7 .",
    "events with an isolated electron or muon , exactly two jets , and @xmath820 gev were chosen .",
    "strong cuts were imposed in events with an electron to reduce the qcd multi - jet background due to jets faking electrons . as a result",
    "the measurement was dominated by events with muons .",
    "validation of the background modeling was also critical for this analysis .",
    "three regions were chosen according to the dijet mass : the signal - rich region with @xmath27 gev and two control regions with @xmath28 gev and @xmath29 gev where very little signal was expected .",
    "good modeling was observed in each region .",
    "some mismodeling in the dijet mass was observed when the control regions were combined , and a corresponding systematic uncertainty on the shape of the @xmath11+jets background was applied .",
    "matrix element calulations were used to discriminate between signal and background .",
    "the differential cross sections of signal and background processes were evaluated for each event .",
    "a discriminant called the event probability discrminant was formed to separate signal from background .",
    "the predicted shapes of signal and background discriminants were fit to the data to extract the diboson cross section . the data superimposed on the background templates is shown in figure  [ fig : wwwz_cdf ] .",
    "the measured cross section is @xmath30 pb where the dominant systematic uncertainty was the jet energy scale .",
    "the significance of the signal observation was 5.4@xmath5 .",

    "the event selection criteria were adjusted to achieve a smoothly falling shape in the @xmath32 distribution of the backgrounds . in particular , the @xmath33 threshold on each individual jet was lowered , but the @xmath33 of the dijet system was required to be larger than 40 gev .",
    "the diboson signal resulted in a bump on top of the background , as shown in figure  [ fig : wwwz_mjj ] .",
    "a fit with signal and background templates was carried out , and the extracted cross section was @xmath34(stat ) @xmath35(sys ) pb , corresponding to an observed significance of 4.6@xmath5 .",

    "several measurements of diboson production cross sections have been carried out recently at the tevatron .",
    "these measurements can be a testing ground for techniques used in searches for the standard model higgs boson .",
    "measurements are performed in many different final states , ranging from those with several identified leptons to those with no identified leptons and two jets .",
    "different analysis techniques are also used , from counting signal events to performing fits to kinematic quantities to techniques involving classifiers or matrix element calculations .",
