    "during evaporation and condensation heat and mass is transported through the interface . the common description of these phenomena uses certain assumptions which are debatable .",
    "for instance , one usually assumes equilibrium conditions at the interface @xcite and neglects the coupling effects between the heat and mass transfer @xcite .",
    "the first one is a zero approximation and it is desirable to extend it to a more accurate theory .",
    "this is done in @xcite for instance . neglecting the coupling coefficients",
    "was shown to violate the second law of thermodynamics for a one - component system @xcite .",
    "the coupling is important since the corresponding transfer coefficients depend on the enthalpy of vaporization .",
    "the significance of this quantity in this context is due to the large difference between the liquid and the vapor values of the enthalpy .",
    "the situation becomes even more complicated when one consider evaporation in mixtures .",
    "these processes happen in such industrial applications as distillation and therefore the precise description is important . depending on conditions",
    "one can get the mass fluxes of components in the same or in the opposite directions .",
    "there has been done a number of studies of the interfacial transport for one - component systems : experiments @xcite , molecular dynamic simulations @xcite , kinetic theory @xcite and square gradient continuous description @xcite .",
    "all these works use different approaches , which allows one to investigate different aspects .",
    "mainly one - component systems have been studied .",
    "one of the points of interest is the dependence of the overall interfacial resistances on the continuous profiles .",
    "once we have a description which relates the resistance of the gibbs surface @xcite to the continuous profiles of , in particular , local resistivities , we can describe the surface separately from the adjacent bulk phases which is closely related to hypothesis of local equilibrium of a surface @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend the analysis done in @xcite for one - component system . here",
    "we do the analysis for mixtures . using the square gradient theory for the non - equilibrium interface developed earlier",
    "@xcite we derive the general relations for the case of the transport perpendicular to the surface .",
    "we show that , as in the case of a one - component system , one can obtain the interfacial resistances using the continuous profiles obtained for equilibrium .",
    "this simplifies analysis a lot since one does not need to consider a non - equilibrium solution in order to obtain these resistivities .",
    "this is in fact a requirement , which the interfacial resistances must satisfy : as being defined within the linear force - flux relations they should depend only on unperturbed quantities , i.e. equilibrium ones .",
    "the evaporation and condensation often take place not only through planar interfaces , but also through curved ones , like the evaporation into a bubble .",
    "we do not restrict ourselves to the planar interfaces and give the expressions for the interfacial resistivities for curved surfaces .",
    "in @xcite we have obtained the overall interfacial resistivities @xmath0 and @xmath1 using three different methods : an experiment - like procedure , a perturbation cell method and kinetic theory ( only @xmath0 ) .",
    "those methods were found to be in a good agreement . in this paper",
    "we compare them with the interfacial resistivities found using integral relations , which relates these quantities to the local resistivities directly .",
    "we show that the agreement is also good .    in this paper we will focus on the heat and mass transfer through the interface of a two - phase mixture .",

    "we also do a consistency check .",
    "consider eq .",
    "for two component mixture , which has a form @xmath134the left hand side of each equation must be equal to the right hand side .",
    "the difference therefore reflects the error .",
    "we give the relative error between the left an the right hand side of eq .   in percent in table  [ [ tbl / x / pc - ir-4 - 9 - 0 - 3 ] ] . as a testing perturbation we used one of those used in the perturbation cell method .",

    "given that this is the case even for a few percent difference in one of the coefficients , we may conclude that the values of the forces are insensitive to the precise value of this resistivity coefficient .",
    "this also indicates that the value of this coefficient obtained in @xcite has a 6% error .",
    "this does not necessarily affect , however , the accuracy of the integral relations .",
    "in this paper we have derived integral relations for the resistivities to the transport of heat and mass across the interface for mixtures . we have given relations between the local resistivity profiles and the overall interfacial resistivities .",
    "the integral relations make it possible to calculate the interfacial resistivities in a relatively simple way , using only the equilibrium profiles of the system .",
    "this is important especially for mixtures , for which the computation of a non - equilibrium profiles is much more time consuming .",
    "the integral relations give an insight in the origin of the interfacial resistances . according to eq .",
    "and eq .   the interfacial resistivities depend on the variation of the enthalpy across the interface .",
    "the transport coefficients depend on the equilibrium enthalpies which vary a lot through the interface .",
    "one can see from the above formulae , that the dependence on the enthalpy of evaporation ( the difference between the enthalpies of the liquid and gas phases ) is crucial not only for the diagonal diffusion coefficient , but also for the off - diagonal coefficients .",
    "this is aa important result since cross coefficients are usually neglected in the description of the interfacial phenomena .",
    "another factor which affects the overall interfacial resistivity is the local resistivity profile .",
    "for instance , for the heat resistivity this is the only factor .",
    "it is noticeable that the interfacial resistivity depends on the whole profile of the local resistivity , not only on its bulk values .",
    "it is therefore crucial to have complete information about the local resistivity profiles .",
    "we have used sums of a function that smoothly connects the liquid and the vapor values and a peak proportional to the square gradient of the density . in principle",
    "one can use any model for this and further investigation are required .",
    "we have shown in @xcite by comparison with the predictions from kinetic theory , that the local resistivities do have a peak in their profile and that the overall resistivities therefore depend on the amplitudes of these peaks . within the current theory",
    "these amplitudes are adjustable parameters .",
    "the integral relations are in fact mathematical equalities . given the local resistivities defined through the local force - flux relations , for instance @xmath95 from eq .  , eq .",
    "follows and one can consider eq .   as a definition of the overall interfacial resistivities @xmath94 used in eq .  .",
    "it means that the force - flux relations for the whole surface follow from the local force - flux relations .",
    "one therefore does not need the excess entropy production eq .   to obtain eq .  .",
    "this allows us to use them as a test for the accuracy of the numerical solution of the non - equilibrium case .",
    "given that both local and overall linear laws are true independently , the different methods to obtain the overall resistivities give information about the accuracy of the method .",
    "the discussion below table  [ [ tbl / diff / pc - ir-4 - 9 - 0 - 3 ] ] and table  [ [ tbl / x / pc - ir-4 - 9 - 0 - 3 ] ] is based on this observation .",
    "we need to relate the resistivities @xmath76 from eq .   to the resistivities @xmath138 from eq .",
    "this is done by comparing the coefficients at the same fluxes in these equations . to do this",
    "we need to translate the set of fluxes used in eq .  , @xmath139 , to the set of fluxes used in eq .",
