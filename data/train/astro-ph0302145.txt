    "we study how the correlation strength varies as the velocity distance along the line of sight or the angular separation between two lines of sight increases .    as discussed above the lyman-@xmath0 forest",
    "is believed to originate from the moderate amplitude density fluctuations in a homogeneously distributed intergalactic medium .",
    "the observed flux in absorption spectra is then a signature of the smoothly varying intergalactic medium density .",

    "we define the unnormalized flux correlation function as : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the normalized flux along two  with separation @xmath37 and mean redshift @xmath1 , and @xmath38 , @xmath39  .",

    "the observation of each quasar pair yields one data point of the transverse correlation function ( @xmath43 ) at the transverse separation between the two quasars , @xmath44 , @xmath45 the open circles in show the transverse correlation function of our observed sample of 11 pairs .",
    "note that the value of the transverse correlation function measured with one pair of quasars is averaged over the redshift range common to both lines of sight .",

    "arcmin corresponds to 1 @xmath7  mpc or about twice the jeans length . at",
    "larger angular scales the measurements for the six pairs with separations between 4 and 10 arcmin are consistent with no transverse flux correlation , or possibly a weak anticorrelation .",
    "the 1@xmath6 errors of the correlation function are estimated using monte carlo realizations of absorption spectra obtained from the numerical simulation described in the previous section .",
    "the simulated absorption spectra were calculated along pairs / groups of lines of sight of constant separation randomly located in the yz plane of the simulation .",
    "we produced several hundred realizations with the same separations as our sample of five pairs and one quadruplet and calculated the transverse and longitudinal correlation functions for all simulated spectra . from this",
    "we have determined the full error matrix including the cross - correlation coefficients to determine the _ rms _ error due to cosmic variance and to look for possible correlations in the errors .",
    "we find that the error matrix is nearly diagonal for the transverse measures .",

    "we performed a kolmogorov - smirnov test and found that the assumption that these points are drawn from a normal distribution with _",
    "rms _ as given by the error bar can not be rejected with a confidence level higher than 10 percent .",
    "nevertheless , this may indicate that we have somewhat underestimated the errors .",
    "this point will be investigated in the future using hydro - simulations .",
    "the data points at larger separation seem to indicate a small anti - correlation . as noticed above the measurements of pairs which are part of the quadruplet at 5.9 , 6.9 , 7.5 and 9.1 arcmin are correlated .",
    "because of this , this is unlikely to be significant and the sample is probably just too small to get a detection of the expected weak correlation at large scales .",
    "if the flux were indeed anti - correlated at scales of a few arcmin this would not be consistent with a opacity distribution that traces the dm distribution in a simple manner ( see also meiksin & bouchet 1995 ) . clearly a larger sample is needed to clarify these points .",
    "the average flux correlation along the line of sight of the twelve spectra taken with the fors spectrograph @xmath46 , is shown as the solid curve in .",
    "error bars are again taken as the diagonal elements of the error matrix obtained from the simulated spectra . for velocity separations larger than our spectral resolution ( @xmath11  @xmath47  220  km  s@xmath12 at 3500  )",

    "the observed correlation functions are compared to those obtained from the simulated spectra ( dashed line ) .",
    "the agreement is good and within the error bars ( see also viel et al .",
    "the agreement between the observed correlation functions along and transverse to the line of sight is remarkable .",
    "it rules out the possibility that the line - of - sight flux correlation is caused by peculiar velocity effects only and corroborates the proposition that the flux correlation reflects the clustering of the underlying matter distribution in real space .",
    "it thus further supports the basic paradigm that the lyman-@xmath0 forest is caused by the fluctuating gunn - peterson absorption due to sheet - like and filamentary structures predicted by hierarchical structure formation scenarios .",
    "the detection of the transverse correlation at scales smaller than three arcmin in our still rather small data set and the good agreement between the transverse and the line of sight correlation funtions is very encouraging for a detailed quantitative comparison between the transverse and the line of sight correlation funtions . if the absorbing structures are randomly orientated with respect to the line of sight ( which should be a trivial assumption ) , such a comparison should constrain cosmological parameters because of the cosmology dependence of the relation between physical length scales measured as velocities along the line of sight and angular distances transverse to the line of sight ( alcock & paczyski 1979 ; see also hui , stebbins & burles 1999 ; mc donald & miralda - escud 1999 ) . this test",
    "is often called the `` alcock & paczyski test '' .",
    "it makes use of the fact that the relation between physical length scales measured along the line of sight as velocities and transverse to the line of sight as angular separations depends on cosmological parameters .",
    "any orientation independent measurable length scale can thus  at least in principle ",
    "constrain cosmological parameters . in our particular case of the comparison of the transverse and line of sight flux correlation functions",
    ", the correlation length should be such an orientation independent length scale .",
    "obviously if the shape of the correlation function is sufficiently well determined the whole function can be used instead .",
    "however the flux correlation function along the line of sight will be affected by peculiar velocities which in turn depend on cosmological parameters .",
    "unfortunately at small scales where the correlation signal is strong the evolution of the matter density is in the non - linear regime and modelling becomes difficult while at large scale where the evolution of the density field and the corresponding peculiar velocities are well approximated by linear theory the correlation signal is weak . as discussed earlier",
    "we have not yet detected a correlation signal at scales larger than 3 armin in the sample presented here . in the following",
    ", we will first explore how the scale factor @xmath48 relating velocities to angular distances depends on cosmology and then describe how we can model the effect of peculiar velocities using linear theory in order to constrain @xmath4 when samples large enough to measure the correlation strength at large scales become available .",
    "the relation between angular distance and velocity depends on the cosmological density parameter , @xmath49 and on the cosmological constant , @xmath4 , in the following way ( weinberg 1972 ) : @xmath50 with @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the @xmath55 function for @xmath56 and the @xmath57 function for @xmath58 . for a flat universe , @xmath59    ( 7,7 )",

    "will be affected by peculiar velocities .",
    "we will use linear theory and a cdm power spectrum to model their effect . the use of linear theory will introduce some systematic biases but as we will demonstrate using numerical simulations these are smaller than our observed uncertainties .",
    "a more detailed treatment will probably be needed to take advantage of more precise measurements of the transverse correlation function expected from future larger samples of qso pairs . in linear theory",
    "the redshift space correlation function of matter is related to the real space correlation as follows ( kaiser 1987 ; matsubara & suto 1996 )  :    @xmath64    where @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 are the legendre polynomials , and @xmath68 ~. \\label{e : xil}\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath69 allows for a linear bias between the observed object ( the flux ) and the underlying mass .",

    "we shall discuss below the distribution of the values of @xmath4 which minimize @xmath89 .",
    "the sample of 30 times the current set of observations may not be efficient in terms of observationnal strategy .",
    "we discuss in the next section the analysis of future observed samples consisting of pairs only .",
    "the dotted curve in figure 7 shows that the current sample is not large enough to get a significant constraint on @xmath4 even if we had marginally detected the weak correlation at large scales .",
    "the observed sample is instead consistent with no and possibly even a weak anti - correlation .",
    "however , as discussed above this is probably due to the the presence of a quadruplet and the resulting correlations in the errors .",
    "close quasar pairs with arcmin separation are rare and we now discuss the question of how many pairs do we need to derive significative constraint on @xmath4 . for this , we shall consider a sample consisting of pairs only ( without additional correlations due to the presence of a quadruplet ) .",
    "we find first that the results obtained with the current sample , as described in sec  4.3 , are very similar to the results with uncorrelated pairs with separations 2 , 2.1 , 2.6 , 4.4 , 6 and 7.5 arcmin .",
    "however , pairs at 2 arcmin are rare .",
    "we thus want to minimize the required number of pairs with small separation .",
    "the solid curve in shows the @xmath89 distribution for a sample of 30 pairs with a separation of 2 and 30 pairs with 4.5 arcmin .",

    "the distribution has a maximum at @xmath102 with a variance of 0.1 and a cut - off at @xmath103 .",
    "additional pairs with large separation , which are available in larger number , lower the upper limit .",
    "three sets of 30 pairs at 2 , 4.5 and 7.5 arcmin respectively , shift the peak of the distribution to @xmath17 and the cut - off to @xmath104 while the variance is similar ( dot - dashed line in ) .",
    "a sample of 30 pairs at 2 arcmin and , at least , 30 pairs with larger separations should therefore constraint the value of @xmath4 to about 15 percent .",
    "the close quadruplet of quasars contained in our sample is well suited to search for the possible presence of large underdense regions in the intergalactic medium which should result in coincident segments of reduced absorption in the lyman-@xmath0 forests of the different spectra .",
    "previous attempts to identify underdense regions in the lyman-@xmath0 forest have searched for regions devoid of absorption lines along a single line of sight .",
    "they looked for portions of spectra where the observed number of absorption lines is significantly smaller than the expected number from synthetic spectra ( carswell & rees 1987 ; crotts 1987 ; ostriker , bajtlik & duncan 1988 ; cristiani et al .",
    "1995 ; kim , cristiani & dodorico 2001 ) . as the forest is usually crowded , a statistically significant detection of an underdense region can be achieved only for regions of dimensions larger than 30 @xmath7  mpc .",
    "underdense regions with a size larger than 40 @xmath7  mpc at @xmath1  @xmath2  2 have already been observed ( e.g. kim et al . 2001 ) .",
    "they are rare however and this dimension probably corresponds to an upper limit .",
    "the simultaneous presence of underdense regions along several close  will greatly enhance the statistical significance of a detection .",
    "this will allow the detection of smaller underdense regions . before analysing the data we have to specify our definition of an underdense region .",
    "we define an underdense region along an individual line of sight as a segment , @xmath105 $ ] , where the normalized flux @xmath106 , is higher than the flux averaged over the observed wavelength range ( @xmath107 )  :    @xmath108    where @xmath6 corresponds to the average value of the noise in the underdense region . for multiple , there is a list of @xmath109 individual underdense regions along each individual : @xmath110^{\\rm j } \\right\\}_{1\\le { \\rm j } \\le n_{\\rm i}}$ ] , where i indexes the individual .",

    "note that , by definition , individual underdense regions along one , can not intersect .",
    "we then define @xmath111 as the random probability to have one common underdense region along n with a size of @xmath112  @xmath7  mpc  @xmath113[multiblock footnote omitted]@xmath114 .",
    "the value of @xmath111 is computed from 10000 realizations of n synthetic spectra along which individual underdense regions and common underdense regions are identified .",
    "the spectra are created over the observed wavelength range by randomly placing lyman lines with the observed number density , column density distribution and doppler parameter distribution at @xmath27 ( e.g. kim et al .",
    "they are degraded in resolution and noise is added to mimick fors spectra . @xmath111 versus @xmath112 is plotted in in the case n=4 . for comparison , @xmath115 is also indicated . as expected , the statistical significance of a common underdense region in a quadruplet is higher than for an individual underdense region for the same size .",
    "the quadruplet consists of the pair q 0103@xmath116294a / q 0103@xmath116294b and the two quasars q  0102@xmath116293 and q  0102@xmath1162931 .",
    "the separations probed are 2.1 , 6 , 8 and 9  arcmin .",
    "shows the relative positions of these four quasars in the sky and the corresponding spectra are plotted in the two upper panels of .",
    "the 2-point correlation is smaller than the 1@xmath6 error except for the pair q",
    "0103@xmath116294a / q  0103@xmath116294b .",
    "each spectrum shows many individual underdense regions of different sizes .",
    "the most interesting feature is a common underdense region of 15    ( 12.5 @xmath7  mpc ) .",
    "it is located between the two vertical solid lines plotted over the four spectra in , defining the wavelength range 3630@xmath1163645   .",
    "the corresponding individual underdense regions are indicated with dashed lines .",
    "their sizes are 25 , 25 , 30 and 16 (@xmath2 21 , 21 , 25 and 13 @xmath7  mpc ) along the  to q  0102@xmath1162931 , q  0103@xmath116294a , q  0103@xmath116294b and q  0102@xmath116293 , respectively .",
    "a broad absorption feature is present in the middle of the under - dense segment along q  0103@xmath116294a .",
    "one pixel ( at 3634.3  ) , while in agreement with , is below the average flux .",
    "note , however , that a resolution element is actually 2.3 pixels and we consider the feature to be above the average flux .",
    "the common underdense region is clearly visible in the upper panel of in which the four spectra are plotted together .",
    "the random probability to have a common underdense region with a size equal or larger than 12.5  @xmath7  mpc is given by integration of @xmath117 for @xmath118 ( shaded region of ) .",
    "the probability is only 2 @xmath119 which shows that the detection of such an underdense region is significant .",
    "( 7,17 ) ( 0.4,11 ) ( 0.5,0 )    the previous analysis did not take into account the relative positions of the quasars in the sky . in the following ,",
    "we consider underdense regions in 3d .",
    "to detect an underdense region in galaxy surveys ( e.g. hoyle & vogeley 2001 ) , the void finding algorithm normally identifies walls of galaxies with a friend - to - friend algorithm .",
    "a void is then defined as the largest sphere that may be included inside one connected region .",
    "contrary to galaxy surveys , we do not have a complete map of the high density regions , but individual underdense regions are fully defined along one , whereas galaxy surveys are limited by some magnitude threshold .",
    "we therefore search for the _ smallest _ underdense region that includes four ( in the case of a quadruplet ) individual underdense regions .",
    "this is equivalent to the requirement that the surface of the underdense region matches the eight edges of the four segments . to formalize this procedure ,",
    "the position of each  is defined as @xmath120 , with the subscript i running from 1 to 4 .",
    "if the 3d surface of the underdense region satisfies @xmath121 , then the above requirement can be written as : @xmath122 where [ @xmath123 defines a set of four individual underdense regions as defined by .",
    "we allow for a variation of @xmath124  in the position of the surface along each .",
    "this takes into account the fact that observations are in redshift space - the border of the underdense region may have a peculiar velocity that shifts its position in wavelength , and that a real underdense region has probably not a simple boundary surface .",
    "the pair q0102 - 294a / b is close and highly correlated .",
    "if the constraint given by is fulfilled for either of the two , it will also be so for the other .",
    "therefore only six real constraints remain .",
    "this set of equations can constrain a sphere that has four degrees of freedom . for simplicity",
    "we therefore search for spherical underdense regions . inside the sphere",
    ", the intergalactic medium will be under - dense along each and on its surface it will be over - dense at eight positions identifying the edges of the individual underdense regions ( the @xmath125 ) . when we applied this procedure to the observed quadruplet only one spherical underdense region was detected .",
    "it is located at the position of the common underdense region described above .",
    "the radius of the sphere is also 12.5  @xmath7  mpc . a schematic three dimensional view of this sphere and the four   is shown in .",
    "the projection of this 3d - view in the transverse plane shows that the four  do not probe the total size of the underdense region in the transverse direction .",
    "the geometrical configuration of the quadruplet does not allow us to discriminate between an ellipse and a sphere .",
    "we have analysed the lyman-@xmath0 forest spectra of a sample of close pairs of quasars ( separations from 0.6 to 10 arcmin ) .",
    "we concentrated on extracting information contained in the measured correlation between the lyman-@xmath0 forest absorption in adjacent lines of sight .",
    "the geometrical configuration of a quadruplet with maximum separation of 10  arcmin contained in the sample has allowed us to search directly for three dimensional structures in the intergalactic medium .",
    "we have detected a 12.5  @xmath7  mpc region where the absorption is everywhere below the average value , and which is present in all four spectra of the quadruplet of quasars contained in our sample .",
    "the individual regions devoid of absorption lines have a length of 21 , 21 , 25 and 13  @xmath7  mpc , respectively . only 2  % of a sample of synthetic spectra with randomly distributed absorption lines have shown an underdense region of this size or larger by chance . note that other possible interpretations include the signature of feedback from proto - clusters ( e.g. theuns , mo & schaye 2001 ) or a local increase in the uv radiation due to the presence of a nearby source ( e.g. savaglio , panagia & padovani 2002 ) .",
    "we also developed a procedure to fit a set of close   with spherical under - dense regions . with this algorithm",
    "the four regions devoid of lines define a three dimensional structure of radius 12.5 @xmath7  mpc .",
    "2 . our sample of pairs probes a large range of angular separations , allowing a more accurate determination of the transverse correlation function than previous studies .",
    "amplitude and shape of the transverse correlation function can be reasonably well determined up to a separation of 2 - 3 arcmin . at separations larger than 5 - 6",
    "arcmin the correlation falls below the level which could be detected from a single pair of quasars .",
    "the measured transverse correlation function at scales smaller than 3 arcmin is consistent with expectations of cdm - like models of structure formation , where the gas is predicted to be correlated up to separation of a few mpc . at larger scales",
    "no positive correlation is detected and the measurements may even indicate a weak anti - correlation which would not be consistent with the idea that the opacity distribution traces the dm distribution in a simple manner ( _ cf _ meiksin & bouchet 1995 ) .",
    "this is most likely due to the fact that our sample is still too small to detect the weak correlation expected on these scales .",
    "a larger sample is needed to clarify the situation .",
    "we have also measured the longitudinal correlation function and found similar results as other authors .",
    "the measured correlation function has a well defined shape out to a separation of @xmath126 km  s@xmath12 . while measured transverse separations are directly related to physical distances , measured line of sight separations are affected by peculiar velocities .",
    "nevertheless the measured transverse and longitudinal correlation functions have similar shape and correlation length for reasonable choices of cosmological parameters .",
    "the longitudinal correlation function must thus indeed measure spatial density correlation on scales of a few mpc as expected if the fluctuating gunn - peterson effect due to the filamentary and sheet - like structures predicted by cdm - like cosmogonies is responsible for the lyman-@xmath0 forest .",
    "we have investigated the possibility of using a quantitative comparison of the transverse and longitudinal correlation functions ( a modified version of the alcock & paczyski test ) to constrain @xmath4 . at larges scales ( @xmath102 arcmin , @xmath127 km  s@xmath12 ) the density field is in the linear regime .",
    "we have thus modelled the peculiar velocities using linear theory for the evolution of density fluctuations .",
    "the linear theory predictions have been fitted simultaneously to the transverse and longitudinal correlations of the flux distribution and the procedure has been tested on numerical simulations .",
    "the current data set is not yet large enough to give significant constraint on @xmath4 .",
    "however , application of the test to simulated spectra of 30 pairs at 2 , 4.5 ( and 7.5 ) arcmin recovered the correct value of @xmath128 in 95% of the realizations .",
    "if the expected weak correlation at scales larger than 3 arcmin can indeed be detected in larger samples of qso pairs a more sophisticated analysis making more extensive use of numerical simulation should deliver very significant constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "careful calibration with numerical simulations may also allow to exploit the much stronger correlations in the non - linear regime at scales smalller than two arcmin .",
