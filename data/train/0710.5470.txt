    "a commonly used approach for the simulation of multi - phase fluid dynamics is the free energy lattice boltzmann method introduced by swift _",
    "et al . _",
    "this constitutes a so - called mesoscale method because it numerically solves the continuum equations of fluid dynamics by exploiting the underlying microscopic structure of these equations , without resorting to a description of the fluid in terms of molecular dynamics .",
    "one obstacle to simulating some systems is that discretisation errors lead to unphysical flows near interfaces .",
    "these so - called spurious velocities are present in multi - phase lattice boltzmann methods and in the other diffuse interface methods .",
    "an illustration of these spurious velocities is given in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , which shows the flow profile around a liquid drop coexisting with a surrounding gas phase .",
    "the simulation is left until the long time steady state behaviour is reached . from a physical point of view all velocities should go to zero .",
    "what is observed , however , is that spurious flows persist indefinitely .",
    "a number of papers have dealt with this problem .",
    "wagner @xcite analysed the case of binary fluids , and identified that one way to eradicate spurious velocities was to remove non - ideal terms from the pressure tensor and introduce these as a body force of the form @xmath1 .",
    "however , because this is no longer written in terms of the divergence of a pressure tensor ( note that in general @xmath2 can always be rewritten as @xmath3 ) then momentum is no longer conserved .",
    "furthermore , wagner pointed out that this method is numerically unstable unless some additional viscosity is artificially added to the system .",
    "lee and fisher @xcite use another forcing method for a different implementation of the lattice boltzmann algorithm .",
    "again , they eliminate spurious velocities at the expense of sacrificing momentum conservation . an additional difficulty with using forcing methods ( including",
    "the one we present later ) is that in order to update each lattice site the algorithm requires information from @xmath4 lattice sites away , rather than just @xmath5 for the standard method .",
    "this makes boundary conditions more complicated and slows down parallel computations , since more information needs to be passed between processors .",
    "seta and okui @xcite used a lattice boltzmann scheme proposed by inamuro _",
    "@xcite , and considered calculating the derivatives in the pressure tensor using a more accurate fourth - order scheme ( as opposed to the usual second order accurate method ) . as will be shown later , however , they do not choose an optimum equilibrium distribution and hence their improvement in the spurious velocities is limited .",
    "in this paper , we analyse the free energy lattice boltzmann scheme for a liquid - gas system proposed by swift _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and show that by making a careful choice of the equilibrium distribution ( and also finding the best way to calculate derivatives ) the magnitude of spurious velocities can be significantly reduced .",
    "furthermore , we present a second numerical scheme which moves gradient terms in the equilibrium distribution into a body force .",
    "this leads to a further reduction in spurious velocities whilst preserving momentum conservation .",
    "the results of this analysis are equally applicable to other multiphase systems ( _ e.g. _ binary fluids ) when the free energy lattice boltzmann method is used to solve their equations of motion .",
    "the pressure tensor for a liquid - gas system using a landau free energy is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the fluid density and @xmath8 is a parameter related to the surface tension .",
    "we choose the bulk pressure @xmath9 to be that of a van der waals fluid , @xmath10 this leads to liquid - gas phase separation below a critical temperature .",
    "the analysis which follows is performed for a d2q9 lattice boltzmann scheme ( in section [ 3d ] the results are summarised for the d3q19 model ) which uses a square lattice of side @xmath11 , time - step @xmath12 , and has @xmath13 velocity vectors , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 . the parameter @xmath20 is a lattice velocity .",

    "the physical variables are related to this distribution function by @xmath24 where @xmath7 is the mass density and @xmath25 is the velocity of the fluid .",

    "it has been shown previously that this reduces to the navier - stokes equation provided the moments of @xmath29 and @xmath30 are chosen suitably @xcite ( see appendix [ app1 ] ) .",
    "the final @xmath30 term is responsible for introducing a body force .",
    "this is not present in the standard formulation of the free energy lattice boltzmann algorithm and so for now we set it to zero . in section",

    "in this paper we analysed the spurious velocities from two different methods : a standard lattice boltzmann scheme and a new forcing method .",
    "firstly , we calculated the spurious forces which originate when the continuous operators in the navier - stokes equation are replaced by stencils ( in other word the contribution from the next order in the taylor series expansion of the stencils ) .",
    "secondly , we identify that spurious velocities result from the component of these spurious forces acting parallel to the interface .",
    "finally , we find that by making a suitable choice of the equilibrium distribution and stencils we were able to set these parallel forces to zero ( up to fourth order in the derivatives ) .    in 2d ,",
    "the best choice of stencils for calculating the derivatives and the laplacian are : @xmath178 , % \\quad \\bar{\\nabla}^2   =   \\tfrac{1}{6 { \\delta x}^2 } \\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc } 1 & 4 & 1 \\\\ 4 & -20 & 4 \\\\ 1 & 4 & 1 \\\\ \\end{array } \\right ] .",

    "the corresponding results are summarised in eqns .",
    "( [ laplacian3d ] ) and ( [ 3dres ] ) .",
    "one way to improve spurious velocities further is to remove the @xmath60 terms from the equilibrium distribution and implement them as a body force .",
    "this force is then explicitly calculated by taking derivatives of @xmath98 using the stencil in eq .",
    "( [ best ] ) ( or eq . ( [ laplacian3d ] ) in the 3d case ) .",
    "the additional symmetry in the resulting equations leads to a further reduction in spurious velocity size .",

    "to conserve mass and momentum the first two constraints on the equilibrium distribution must be @xmath185 the higher order moments of @xmath29 are chosen such that the resulting continuum equations describe the dynamics of a non - ideal fluid .",
    "a suitable choice is @xmath186 where @xmath187 will become the shear and bulk kinematic viscosities , respectively .",
