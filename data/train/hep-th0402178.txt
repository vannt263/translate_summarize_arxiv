    "fluctuations in the values of physical quantities is an inalienable trait of all quantum phenomena , which finds its reflection in the probabilistic nature of the quantum - mechanical description of elementary particle kinematics as well as of the field - theoretic treatment of the fundamental interactions .",
    "investigation of fluctuations constitutes an essential part in establishing quasi - classical conditions , and therefore in dealing with the issue of correspondence between given quantum theory and its classical original .",
    "precise identification of the quasi - classical conditions is especially important in investigation of the measurement process . in this process",
    ", an essential role is played by the measuring device `` recording '' the results of an observation , and the question of primary importance is to what extent this device can be considered classically .",
    "furthermore , investigation of fluctuations in the observable quantities themselves is a significant ingredient in the theoretical treatment of the measurement process , in particular , in verifying conformity of the formalism of quantum theory with the principal realizability of measurements .    in the latter aspect ,",
    "the issue of quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field was considered in detail by bohr and rosenfeld @xcite . in this classic paper , a comprehensive analysis of the measurability of electromagnetic field",
    "was given , and compatibility of the restrictions following from the formal relations for the field operators with the actual limitations inherent to any process of measurement was verified , refuting the earlier arguments by landau and peierls @xcite against this compatibility . in a subsequent paper @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , the authors argued that the problem of charge - current measurements can be reduced to that already solved for the electromagnetic field . later , a similar investigation was carried out in quantum theory of gravitation by dewitt @xcite .",
    "an important point underlying investigation of refs .",
    "@xcite is that the question of measurability of the electromagnetic field , and hence of charges and currents , can be considered proceeding from the commutation relations for the operators describing free electromagnetic field . in particular ,",
    "these relations were used to estimate characteristic value of the electromagnetic field fluctuations , denoted in @xcite by @xmath4 defined as the root mean square fluctuation , @xmath5 is evidently of the order @xmath6 varies depending on the ratio of the space and time intervals characterizing the measurement process , but in any case it is proportional to @xmath7 below , our main concern will be the dependence of @xmath5 on the planck constant , so we suppress all other factors on which @xmath5 may depend .",
    "] it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that this estimate holds true even in the presence of sources , provided that the charge and current distributions representing these sources allow classical description ( which was also confirmed later by detailed calculations in refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    as far as one is interested in the electromagnetic field produced by the test bodies , this result is certainly sufficient to justify the use of the relation @xmath8 since the choice of the experimental setup is at disposal of the observer",
    ", the measuring device may always be assumed `` sufficiently classical . ''",
    "however , the state of affairs is different when the _ given _ electromagnetic field to be measured is considered .",
    "classical assumption about the field producing sources is irrelevant in this case , and the above estimate does not apply .",
    "the problem of fundamental importance , therefore , is to determine fluctuations of fields produced by nonclassical sources .    on various occasions",
    ", this issue has been the subject of a number of investigations .",
    "electromagnetic field fluctuations springing up as a response of elementary particles vacua to external fields or nontrivial boundary conditions were studied recently in @xcite where references to early works can be found .",
    "fluctuations of the gravitational field , induced by vacuum fluctuations of the matter stress tensor were considered in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that despite extensive literature in the area , only vacua contributions of quantized matter fields to the fluctuations of electromagnetic and gravitational fields have been studied in detail . at the same time , it is effects produced by real matter that are most interesting from the point of view of the structure of elementary contributions to the field fluctuation .    the purpose of this paper is to investigate fluctuations of the electromagnetic field produced by a single massive charged particle , taking full account of quantum properties of the source - field interaction .",
    "it will be shown that the structure of fluctuations in this case is quite different from that of vacuum - induced fluctuations , or that found in the case of classical source .",
    "in particular , the root mean square fluctuation of the field turns out to be of zero order in the planck constant , @xmath9 rather than @xmath6 it seems that this remarkable fact has not been noticed earlier . for a given electric charge of the source consisting of many particles , the @xmath1 contribution turns out to be inversely proportional to the number of constituent particles , so the classical @xmath10 estimate is recovered in the macroscopic limit .",
