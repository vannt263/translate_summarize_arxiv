    "data from national sex surveys @xcite provide quantitative information on the number of sexual partners , the degree @xmath0 , of an individual . usually , surveys involve a random sample of the population stratified by age , economical and cultural level , occupation , marital status , etc .",
    "the respondents are asked to provide information on sexual attitudes such as the number of sex partners they have had in the last 12 months or in their entire life .",
    "although in most cases the response rate is relatively small , the information gathered is statistically significant and global features of sexual contact patterns can be extracted . in particular",
    ", it turns out that the number of heterosexual partners reported from different populations is well described by power - law sf distributions .",
    "table [ tab : scn ] summarizes the main results of surveys conducted in sweden , united kingdom , zimbabwe and burkina faso @xcite .    the first thing to notice is the gender - specific difference in the number of sexual acquaintances @xcite .",
    "this is manifested by the existence of two different exponents in the sf degree distributions , one for males ( @xmath9 ) and one for females ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "interestingly enough , the predominant case in table [ tab : scn ] , no matter whether data refers to time frames of 12 months or to entire life , consists of one exponent being smaller and the other larger than 3 .",
    "this is certainly a borderline case that requires further investigation on the value of the epidemic threshold .",
    "the differences found in the two exponents @xmath10 and @xmath9 have a further implication for real data and mathematical modeling . in an exhaustive survey , able to reproduce the whole network of sexual contacts , the total number of female partners reported by men should equal the total number of male sexual partners reported by women .",
    "mathematically , this means that the number of links ending at population @xmath11 ( of size @xmath12 ) equals the number of links ending at population @xmath13 ( of size @xmath14 ) , which translates into the following closure relation : @xmath15 assuming that the degree distributions for the two sets are truly scale - free , then @xmath16 , with the symbol @xmath17 standing for the gender @xmath18 , and @xmath19 being the minimum degree .",
    "moreover , if @xmath20 and @xmath21 for any @xmath17 , eq .",
    "( [ closure ] ) gives the relation between the two population sizes as @xmath22 which implies that the less heterogeneous ( in degree ) population must be larger than the other one .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      although both epidemic thresholds , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , tend to zero as the population goes to infinity , the scaling relations , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , are characterized by two different exponents , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "table [ tab : exp ] reports the expression of these two exponents as a function of @xmath10 and @xmath9 , showing that @xmath28 is always smaller than @xmath27 .",
    "in particular , for the most common case ( see table [ tab : scn ] ) , i.e. when one degree distribution exponent is in the range @xmath292,3]$ ] , and the other one is larger than @xmath30 , the value of @xmath28 found for bipartite networks is two times smaller than @xmath27 . as a consequence , the results show that in finite bipartite populations the onset of the epidemic takes place at larger values of the spreading rate .",
    "in other words , it could be the case that for a given transmission probability , in the unipartite representation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) the epidemic would have survived infecting a fraction of the population , while when only crossed infections are allowed , as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) , the same disease would not have produced an endemic state .",
    "moreover , the difference between the epidemic thresholds predicted by the two approaches increases with the system size .",
    "this dependency is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where we have reported , as a function of the system size , the critical thresholds obtained by numerically solving eqs .",
    "( [ threshold ] ) and ( [ threshold2 ] ) with the values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 found for the lifetime distribution of sexual partners in sweden @xcite and u.k @xcite .",
    "to check the validity of the analytical arguments and also to explore the dynamics of the disease above the epidemic threshold , we have conducted extensive numerical simulations of the sis model in bipartite and unipartite computer - generated networks .",
    "bipartite and unipartite graphs of a given size are built up ( see methods section ) having the same degree distributions , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and thus they only differ in the way the nodes are linked .",
    "a fraction of infected individuals is initially randomly placed on the network and the sis dynamics is evolved : at each time step susceptible individuals get infected with probability @xmath33 if they are connected to an infectious one , and get recovered with probability @xmath34 ( hence , the effective transmission probability is @xmath35 ) .",
    "after a transient time , the system reaches a stationary state where the total prevalence of the disease , @xmath36 , is measured ( see methods ) .",
    "the results are finally averaged over different initial conditions and network realizations .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the fraction of infected individuals as a function of @xmath37 for several system sizes and for the bipartite ( ( a ) and ( b ) ) and unipartite ( ( c ) and ( d ) ) graphs . in this figure",
    ", the infection probability @xmath38 has been rescaled by the theoretical value @xmath39 given by eq .",
    "( [ threshold ] ) .",
    "the purpose of the rescaling is twofold .",
    "first it allows to check the validity of the theoretical predictions and , at the same time , it provides a clear comparison of the results obtained for bipartite networks with those obtained for the unipartite case .",
    "again we have used the values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 extracted from the lifetime number of sexual partners reported for sweden and u.k .",
    "@xcite . fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] indicates that the analytical solution , eq .",
    "( [ threshold ] ) , is in good agreement with the simulation results for the two - gender model formulation .",
    "conversely when the bipartite nature of the underlying graph is not taken into account , the epidemic threshold is underestimated , being @xmath40 smaller than @xmath41 .",
    "in addition to this , the error in the estimation grows as the population size increases , in agreement with our theoretical predictions .",
    "the inclusion of the bipartite nature of contact networks to describe crossed infections in the spread of stds in heterosexual populations is seen to affect strongly the epidemic outbreak and leads to an increase of the epidemic threshold .",
    "our results show that , even in the cases when the epidemic threshold vanishes in the infinite network size limit , the epidemic incidence in finite populations is less dramatic than actually expected for unipartite scale - free networks .",
    "the results also point out that the larger the population , the greater the gap between the epidemic thresholds predicted by the two models , therefore highlighting the need to accurately take into account all the available information on how heterosexual contact networks look like .",
    "our results also have important consequences for the design and refinement of efficient degree - based immunization strategies aimed at reducing the spread of stds .",
    "in particular , they pose new questions on how such strategies have to be modified when the interactions are further compartmentalized by gender and only crossed infections are allowed .",
    "we finally stress that the present approach is generalizable to other models for disease spreading ( _ e.g. _ the `` _ susceptible - infected - removed _ '' model ) and other processes where crossed infection in bipartite networks is the mechanism at work .",
    "synthetic bipartite networks construction starts by fixing the number of males , @xmath42 and the two exponents @xmath9 and @xmath10 of the power - law degree distributions corresponding to males and females respectively .",
    "the first stage consists of assigning the connectivity @xmath43 ( @xmath44, ... ,@xmath12 ) to each member of the male population by generating @xmath45 random numbers with probability distribution @xmath46 ( @xmath47 , with @xmath48 ) .",
    "the sum of these @xmath45 random numbers fixes the number of links @xmath49 of the network .",
    "the next step is to construct the female population by means of an iterative process . for this purpose",
    "we progressively add female individuals with a randomly assigned degree following the distribution @xmath50 ( @xmath51 , with @xmath48 ) .",
    "female nodes are incorporated until the total female connectivity reaches the number of male edges , @xmath52 . in this way one",
    "sets the total number of females @xmath14 .",
    "once the two sets of @xmath12 males and @xmath14 females with their corresponding connectivities are constructed each one of the @xmath49 male edges is randomly linked to one of the available female edges avoiding multiple connections .",
    "finally those few female edges that did not receive a male link in the last stage are removed and the connectedness of the resulting network is checked .",
    "synthetic unipartite networks has been constructed in two ways .",
    "the simplest one consists of taking the two sets of @xmath12 males and @xmath14 females constructed for the bipartite network and apply a rewiring process to the entire population , _ i.e. _ allowing links between individuals of the same sex . in the second method , a set of @xmath53 individuals whose connectivities",
    "are randomly assigned following the degree distribution @xmath54 is generated before applying a wiring process between all pairs of edges . in both methods the wiring process avoids multiple and self connections and those isolated edges that remain at the end of the network construction are removed .",
    "the connectedness of the networks is also checked .",
    "montecarlo simulations of sis dynamics are performed using networks of sizes ranging from @xmath55 to @xmath56 .",
    "the initial fraction of infected nodes is set to @xmath57 of the network size .",
    "the sis dynamics is initially evolved for a time typically of @xmath58 time - steps and after this transient the system is further evolved over consecutive time windows of @xmath59 steps . in these time windows",
    "we monitor the mean value of the number of infected individuals , @xmath60 .",
    "the steady state is reached if the absolute difference between the average number of infected individuals of two consecutive time windows is less than @xmath61 .",

    "<S> for instance , sf networks are very robust to random failures , but at the same time extremely fragile to targeted attacks of the highly connected nodes @xcite . in the context of disease spreading , sf contact networks lead to a vanishing epidemic threshold in the limit of infinite population when @xmath2 @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> conversely , when @xmath8 , there is a finite threshold and the epidemic survives only when the spreading rate is above a certain critical value . </S>",
    "<S> the concept of a critical epidemic threshold is central in epidemiology . </S>",
    "<S> its absence in sf networks with @xmath7 has a number of important implications in terms of prevention policies : if diseases can spread and persist even in the case of vanishingly small transmission probabilities , then prevention campaigns where individuals are randomly chosen for vaccination are not much effective @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in disease spreading as well as on the relation between the network structure and the dynamical patterns of the spreading process has improved in the last several years @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> current approaches are either individual - based simulations @xcite or metapopulation models where network simulations are carried out through a detailed stratification of the population and infection dynamics @xcite . in the particular case of sexually transmitted diseases ( stds ) , infections occur within the unique context of sexual encounters , and the network of contacts @xcite is a critical ingredient of any theoretical framework . unfortunately , ascertaining complete sexual contact networks in significatively large populations is extremely difficult . </S>",
    "<S> however , here we show that it is indeed possible to make use of known global statistical features to generate more accurate predictions of the critical epidemic threshold for stds . </S>"
