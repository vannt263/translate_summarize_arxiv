    "recent astrophysical data , from the hubble diagram of type ia supernovae ( sneia ) @xcite to the measurement of the anisotropy and polarization spectra of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) @xcite and large scale structure data @xcite , point out towards a picture of the universe unexpected only few years ago . according to this new scenario ,",
    "the universe is spatially flat , undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion and dominated by a smoothly distributed negative pressure fluid dubbed _ dark energy_. although a lot of candidates has been proposed for this mysterious component @xcite , the concordance @xmath0cdm model @xcite made out of cold dark matter ( cdm ) and the einstein cosmological constant @xmath0 stands as the best fit to a wide range of different astrophysical data @xcite . notwithstanding its observational merits , the @xmath0cdm scenario is seriously plagued by the well known coincidence and fine tuning problems which are the main motivations to look for alternative models .",
    "although as a classical ( general relativistic ) field theory the concordance model is fairly simple , a universe presently dominated by a positive @xmath0 term is on the contrary quite difficult to understand from a quantum theory viewpoint . indeed , since matter and radiation energy density fades away as @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively ( with @xmath4 the scale factor ) , the universe turns out to be asymptotically dominated by the vacuum energy accounted for by the positive @xmath0 . as a consequence , the universe asymptotically enters a de sitter phase with the scale factor growing exponentially and a never ending accelerated expansion . let us then consider the definition of cosmic horizon as :    @xmath5    with @xmath6 and @xmath7 the present day age of the universe and its age at the end of time ( i.e. , @xmath8 ) . note that , while for a closed universe @xmath7 takes a finite value , this is not for open and spatially flat models ( @xmath9 ) . for a de sitter like universe",
    ", @xmath10 takes a finite value so that a cosmic horizon appears .",
    "it is worth stressing that this problem is not strictly related to @xmath0 , but turns out to be a consequence of eternal acceleration .",
    "should we replace @xmath0 with a quintessence scalar field , the universe should still be eternally accelerated finally reaching a de sitter phase and hence again a finite cosmic horizon .",
    "the presence of a cosmic horizon implies that it is not possible to define pure state vectors of quantum asymptotic states . as a consequence , in a de sitter background spacetime ,",
    "it is not possible to define a gauge invariant scattering matrix @xmath11 .",
    "first studied in @xcite , this problem is known as _",
    "superexpansionary divergence _ in the context of quantum field theory ( qft ) and is particularly troublesome for the formulation of strings theory .",
    "indeed , by construction @xcite , perturbative string theory is based on the well defined nature of scattering amplitudes of various excitations and hence fundamentally relies on the possibility to correctly define the @xmath11-matrix @xcite . as such , formulating string theory in presence of a finite cosmic horizon is challenging .",
    "the so called liouville string framework @xcite represents an attempt to solve the problem in the case of non conformal backgrounds ( including the de sitter spacetime ) , but much work is still needed before a complete mathematical formulation is achieved .",
    "a radically different approach is , however , possible .",
    "indeed , observations do tell us that the universe is spatially flat and accelerating , but this by no way implies that the acceleration should be eternal .",
    "this latter feature turns out only as a consequence of assuming a positive @xmath0 term to explain cosmic speed up . from an observational point of view",
    ", however , nothing prevents us to consider an effective dark energy fluid as a source of the accelerated expansion .",
    "we can then split its energy density as the sum of two components and then investigate the consequences on the future evolution of the universe .",
    "such an approach has been recently investigated by some authors @xcite with interesting results .",
    "in particular , in @xcite , some of us have presented a model whose dark energy component is the sum of a _ negative _ cosmological constant and a quintessence scalar field evolving under the action of an exponential potential . as a result , although the model is presently accelerating , eternal acceleration disappears and the universe ends in a big crunch like singularity in a finite time .",
    "motivated by these theoretical virtues , we further explore this model by the observational point of view in order to see whether a negative @xmath0 is indeed compatible with the astrophysical data at hand .",
    "notwithstanding the positive evidence of the model , it is also worth wondering whether an alternative theoretical derivation is possible . actually , there are difficulties to reconcile a negative @xmath0 term within the framework of quantum field theory . in the context of the standard model of elementary particle physics , spontaneous symmetry breaking induces a large ( negative ) value of the cosmological constant :    @xmath12    if we apply the current experimental bounds on the mass of the higgs boson @xmath13 and on the fermi constant @xmath14 , we obtain a ( negative ) value 55 orders of magnitude larger than the observed upper bound of the cosmological constant cc .",
    "there have been several attempts to solve this problem , without enough success @xcite .",
    "a vacuum cosmological term @xmath15 with ( positive ) opposite sign is often introduced , so that the physical observable cosmological constant results :    @xmath16    the introduction of @xmath15 is also dictated by the requirement of renormalizability of the massive theory , so the cc problem is rather the need of the extremely precise choice of the corresponding normalization condition @xmath17 in the very far infrared .",
    "it is very difficult to explain why the two terms on the right hand side of above equation should cancel each other with such accuracy at that point . on the other hand , as for all quintessence models , it is not totally clear where the scalar field comes from .",
    "having such a large dominance by dark ingredients is , for sure , a disturbing situation so that it is worth to look for other potential explanations .",
    "following the prescriptions of the occam razor , it is desirable to have as less components of unknown origin as possible in a cosmological model . in order to overcome this problem ,",
    "we resort to fourth order theories of gravity ( also referred to in the following as @xmath1 theories ) . according to this approach ,",
    "cosmic acceleration is the first signal of a breakdown of general relativity so that the gravity lagrangian has to be modified by replacing the scalar curvature @xmath18 with a generic analytic function @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown @xcite that it is always possible to find out a @xmath1 theory reproducing the same dynamics ( i.e. , scale factor and hubble parameter ) as a given dark energy model . using this method",
    ", we can reformulate the model above in terms of fourth order theories of gravity .",
    "the resulting @xmath1 will allow to both fit the data and solve the problem of eternal acceleration without resorting to a controversial negative @xmath0 and an ad hoc scalar field .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we present the starting cosmological model in sect . 2 where we generalize the approach in @xcite including the radiation term .",
    "the numerical solution for the expansion rate for this model is the key ingredient for the likelihood analysis discussed in sect . 3 where we contrast the model against a wide set of observational data thus being able to constrain its characteristic parameters .",
    "although our model comprises two ingredients other than standard matter and radiation , it is worth stressing that it is dynamically equivalent to a model dominated by a single dark energy fluid whose equation of state is reconstructed in sect .",
    "4 . the best fit model is , on the other hand , used as input for the procedure of reconstructing @xmath1 which is presented in sect . 5 where we show that a negative @xmath0 could result as part of an effective representation of a fourth order theory .",
    "6 is finally devoted to conclusions .",
    "looking at the impressive amount of papers addressing the problem of cosmic acceleration clearly shows that two leading candidates to the dark energy throne are the old cosmological consntat @xmath0 and a scalar field @xmath19 evolving under the influence of its self - interaction potential @xmath20 . while a @xmath0 term adds a constant energy density @xmath21 and a negative pressure @xmath22 into the cosmic evolution equations , a scalar field partecipates to the dynamics through its energy density and pressure given as :    @xmath23    with a dot denoting the derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath24 .",
    "the evolution of the scalar field is then governed by its klein - gordon equation :    @xmath25    with @xmath26 the hubble parameter and @xmath4 the scale factor ( normalized to unity at the present time ) .",
    "it is easy to show that eq.([eq : kg ] ) is the same as the continuity equation for the scalar field energy density @xmath27 under the hypothesis that @xmath19 does not interact with the matter and the other ingredients of the cosmic pie .    in the usual approach ,",
    "one adds either a scalar field or a cosmological constant term to the field equations .",
    "however , since what we see is only the final effect of the dark energy components , in principle nothing prevents us to add more than one single component provided that the effective dark energy fluid coming out is able to explain the data at hand .",
    "moreover , as we have hinted upon above , a single scalar field , while explaining cosmic speed up , leads to a problematic eternal acceleration . a possible way out of this problem has been proposed by some of us @xcite through the introduction of a negative cosmological term .",
    "motivated by those encouraging results , we therefore consider a spatially flat universe filled by dust matter , radiation , scalar field and a ( negative ) cosmological constant term .",
    "the friedmann equations thus read :    @xmath28 \\ , \\label{eq : f1}\\ ] ]    @xmath29 \\ , \\label{eq : f2}\\ ] ]    where we have used natural units with @xmath30 . using the continuity equation for @xmath31 and @xmath32 and the definition of density parameter for the i - th fluid    @xmath33    eqs.([eq : f1 ] ) and ( [ eq : f2 ] )",
    "may be rewritten as :    @xmath34    @xmath35    with @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and we denote with a subscript @xmath39 the present day value of a quantity .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless variable    @xmath40    with @xmath41 the redshift ( having set @xmath42 ) . in terms of this variable ,",
    "the friedmann equations become :    @xmath43    @xmath44    while the klein - gordon equation reads :    @xmath45    as well known , given an expression for the scalar field potential @xmath46 , only two out of the three equations ( [ eq : f1u ] ) , ( [ eq : f2u ] ) , ( [ eq : kgu ] ) are independent .",
    "it is convenient to insert eqs.([eq : f1u ] ) and ( [ eq : f2u ] ) into eq.([eq : kgu ] ) to get a single equation governing the evolution of the scalar field :    @xmath47 \\frac{d\\tilde{\\phi}}{du } = 0 \\label{eq : sfeq}\\ ] ]    with @xmath48 given by eq.([eq : f1u ] ) . in order to solve ( numerically ) this equation thus determining @xmath49 and then e(u ) through eq.([eq : f1u ] ) , one has to set two initial conditions . the first one can be trivially obtained by evaluating eq.([eq : f1u ] ) in @xmath50 to get :    @xmath51    with @xmath52 . given the shape of the potential @xmath20 , the above relation can be inverted to get the present day value of the scalar field",
    ". a second initial condition can be obtained by first considering the equation of state ( hereafter eos ) of the field given as :    @xmath53    evaluating this at the present day and using the above relation for @xmath54 , we finally get the initial conditions :    @xmath55    @xmath56    with @xmath57 .",
    "note that , since the left hand side of eqs.([eq : phiz ] ) and ( [ eq : dphiduz ] ) are positive definite , we get the constraint @xmath58 which is always verified for any ordinary scalar field whatever the potential @xmath46 is .      in order to separate models in accelerating and decelerating ones , one has to compute the present day value of the deceleration parameter defined as :    @xmath59    using eqs.([eq : f1u ] ) and ( [ eq : f2u ] ) , we can therefore write the deceleration parameter as :    @xmath60 \\\\ ~ & { \\times } & \\frac{(3/2 ) \\omega_m { \\rm e}^{3u } + 2 \\omega_r { \\rm e}^{4u } + ( 3/2 ) \\left ( d\\tilde{\\phi}/du \\right ) ^2}{\\omega_m { \\rm e}^{3u } + \\omega_r { \\rm e}^{4u } + \\omega_{\\lambda } + \\tilde{v}(\\tilde{\\phi } ) } \\ . \\nonumber",
    "\\label{eq : qu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    evaluating this relation in @xmath50 and using eq.([eq : dphiduz ] ) , the present day value then reads :    @xmath61    so that , in order to have accelerating models @xmath62 , we have to set the constraint :    @xmath63    we can also solve eq.([eq : qz ] ) with respect to @xmath64 to get :    @xmath65    so that the initial conditions now rewrite :    @xmath66    @xmath67    since the lhs of these relations are positive quantities , we get the following constraints on the present day deceleration parameter :    @xmath68    for accelerating models , the lower limit in eq.([eq : qzrange ] ) must be negative so that we get :    @xmath69    note that for models with a negative cosmological constant this relation is always satisfied thus meaning that for such a choice it is possible to work out accelerating solutions of the field equations .",
    "the above discussion holds whatever is the scalar field potential @xmath20 , but in order to actually solve the cosmic equations we have to definitively assign an analytical expression for this quantity . following @xcite",
    ", we consider an exponential potential :    @xmath70    with @xmath71 a generic constant and @xmath72 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , such a choice leads to a cosmological model ( made out of the above scalar field and dust matter ) in good agreement with a large set of astrophysical data .",
    "although being interesting on both theoretical and observational grounds , such a model is however affected by the problem of eternal acceleration . as can be easily understood ,",
    "since the matter energy density decreases as @xmath2 ( with @xmath4 the scale factor normalized to be unity at the present day ) , the universe becomes soon scalar field dominated and the accelerating expansion never ends . in order to avoid this problem , cardenas et al .",
    "@xcite have added a third ingredient to the cosmic pie , namely a negative cosmological constant . the nther symmetry approach",
    "@xcite makes it possible to find a convenient change of variables in such a way that exact solutions are found .",
    "although dealing with an analytical expression is welcome , the result in @xcite only holds if the radiation term is neglected . while this is not a problem when considering the late universe , introducing radiation drastically changes the structure of the cosmic equations so that the nther symmetry approach does not apply anymore . as a consequence ,",
    "the analytical solution may no more be used and a numerical analysis is needed . to this end , we insert eq.([eq : phipot ] ) into eq.([eq : phiz ] ) and solve with respect to @xmath73 :    @xmath74 } = - \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{9 } } \\ln{\\left [ \\omega_{\\phi } ( 1 - w_0 ) \\right ] } \\label{eq : phizexp}\\ ] ]    where , in the second equality , we have arbitrarily set @xmath75 .",
    "note that such a choice has no effect on the dynamics since it is a simple rescaling of the scalar field @xmath76 which does not influence any physically interesting quantity . with such a choice ,",
    "the potential and its derivative then read :    @xmath77    summarising , in order to determine the cosmic dynamics ( i.e. , the scale factor and the hubble parameter ) for such a model with both a negative cosmological constant @xmath0 and a scalar field @xmath19 with an exponential potential added to the standard dust matter and radiation terms , we have to numerically integrate eq.([eq : sfeq ] ) with the potential given by eq.([eq : phidphiexp ] ) and the initial conditions ( [ eq : phizexp ] ) and ( [ eq : dphiduz ] ) . the solution for @xmath49 thus obtained may then be inserted into the potential and then into eq.([eq : f1u ] ) to determine the hubble parameter which can be further integrated to get the scale factor . in order to perform such a scheme",
    ", one has to set the values of up to four parameters , namely the dust and radiation density parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and the present day values @xmath80 of the scalar field energu density and eos respectively .",
    "in particular , one could use eq.([eq : qzconst ] ) to choose @xmath64 in such a way that the resulting model will be today accelerating .",
    "notwithstanding how well motivated it is , a whatever model must be able to reproduce what is observed .",
    "this is particularly true for the model we are considering because the presence of a negative cosmological constant introduces a positive pressure term potentially inhibiting the cosmic speed up . moreover , contrasting the model against the data offers also the possibility to constrain its characteristic parameters and estimate other derived interesting quantities , such as @xmath81 , the transition redshift @xmath82 and the age of the universe @xmath6 .",
    "motivated by these considerations , we will therefore fit our model to the dataset described below parametrizing the model itself with the matter density @xmath78 , the scalar field quantities @xmath80 and the dimensionless hubble constant @xmath83 ( i.e. , @xmath84 in units of @xmath85 ) , while we will set the radiation density parameter as @xmath86 as in @xcite from a median of different values reported in literature .      in order to constrain the model parameters",

    "this is given as :    @xmath93    with @xmath94 the luminosity distance ( in mpc ) defined as :    @xmath95    as input data , we use the sneia sample assembled in @xcite by putting on a common scale the data recently released from the snls @xcite and essence collaborations @xcite and the higher redshift sneia observed with hst in the goods survey @xcite . as well known , the sneia hubble diagram is unable to determine the hubble constant @xmath84 since this quantity is degenerate with the ( unknown ) absolute magnitude @xmath96 . as such , davis et al .",
    "have put all the sneia on the same distance scale using @xmath97 . in our analysis , however , we will leave @xmath83 as a free parameter so that eq.([eq : defmu ] ) must be rewritten as :    @xmath98    with @xmath99 and @xmath100 the hubble free luminosity distance . note that the value of @xmath83 determined by this fit will not be fully reliable because of the degeneracy hinted above",
    ". however , such a problem will not affect the estimates of the other parameters since we will marginalize over @xmath83 in the analysis of the results .",
    "the second term in eq.([eq : defchi ] ) relies on the gas mass fraction in galaxy clusters .",
    "we briefly outline here the method referring the interested reader to the literature for further details @xcite .",
    "both theoretical arguments and numerical simulations predict that the baryonic mass fraction in the largest relaxed galaxy clusters should be invariant with the redshift ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "however , this will only appear to be the case when the reference cosmology in making the baryonic mass fraction measurements matches the true underlying cosmology . from the observational point of view",
    ", it is worth noting that the baryonic content in galaxy clusters is dominated by the hot x - ray emitting intra - cluster gas so that what is actually measured is the gas mass fraction @xmath101 and it is this quantity that should be invariant with the redshift within the caveat quoted above .",
    "moreover , it is expected that the baryonic fraction in clusters equals the universal ratio @xmath102 so that @xmath101 should indeed be given by @xmath103 where the multiplicative factor @xmath104 is motivated by simulations that suggest that the gas fraction is slightly lower than the universal ratio because of processes that convert part of the gas into stars or eject it outside the cluster .",
    "following ref.@xcite , we adopt the concordance @xmath0cdm model ( i.e. , with @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 ) as reference cosmology in making the measurements so that the theoretical expectation for the apparent variation of @xmath101 with the redshift is @xcite :    @xmath108^{3/2 } \\ .",
    "\\label{eq : fgas}\\ ] ]    some words are needed to explain the meaning of the different terms entering the above equations .",
    "first , the two functions @xmath109 and @xmath110 take into account variations of the ratio @xmath102 due to gastrophysics and star formation respectively . in a first approximation , .",
    "they are described as linear functions of the redshift . however , in order to not increase the number of parameters , we will set them to constant values taking @xmath111 and @xmath112 in agreement with @xcite .",
    "while @xmath113 and @xmath114 are normalizing factors correcting for measurement related problems and can be put to the constant values 1.0 and 1.05 respectively , @xmath115 actually plays a more important role . to understantd its origin , it is worth remembering that @xmath101 is typically measured at a given fraction of the cluster virial radius",
    ". however , on the sky distances are measured in angular rather than physical units with the conversion depending on the assumed cosmological model .",
    "since the reference model is different from the actual one , a correction term must be included to account for the change in the radius . considering the scaling of the different quantities involved in the measurement process , it is possible to show that the correction term may be approximated as @xcite :    @xmath116^{\\eta } \\label{eq : defaz}\\ ] ]    with @xmath117^{1/2}$ ] and @xmath118 .",
    "note that , actually , because of the small @xmath119 value , this term does not play a significant role in the fitting process , while a key ingredient is the last one in eq.([eq : fgas ] ) given by the ratio of the angular diameter distances @xmath120 between the @xmath0cdm and the model to be tested .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath121 depends not only on the integrated hubble parameter , but also explicitly on the baryon and total matter density parameters @xmath122 and @xmath78 . in particular , baryogenesis calculations contrasted to the observed abundances of primordial elements puts a severe constraint on the physical baryon density @xmath123 . using this method , kirkman et al . @xcite",
    "have determined :    @xmath124    a rigorous analysis should be done letting @xmath125 as a free parameter eventually including the above estimates as a prior . however , in order to not increase the number of parameters to be determined , we will set @xmath126 neglecting the small error .",
    "the third term in the definition of @xmath89 takes into account the measurement of the _ baryonic acoustic oscillation _ ( bao ) peak in the large scale correlation function at @xmath127 separation detected by eisenstein et al .",
    "@xcite using a sample of 46748 luminous red galaxies ( lrg ) selected from the sdss main sample @xcite .",
    "actually , rather than the position of acoustic peak itself , a closely related quantity is better constrained from these data , namely the acoustic peak parameter defined as @xcite :    @xmath128^{1/3 } \\label{eq : defapar}\\ ] ]    with @xmath129 the effective redshift of the lrg sample , and we have introduced the dimensionless coordinate distance @xmath130 defined as :    @xmath131    as it is clear , the @xmath132 parameter depends not only on the dimensionless coordinate distance ( and thus on the integrated expansion rate ) , but also on @xmath78 and @xmath133 explicitly which removes some of the degeneracies intrinsic in distance fitting methods .",
    "therefore , it is particularly interesting to include @xmath132 as a further constraint on the model parameters using its measured value @xcite :    @xmath134    with @xmath135 the spectral index of the primordial density perturbations . for @xmath136 as determined by the wmap 3rd year analysis @xcite , we get @xmath137 as set in eq.([eq : defchi ] ) .",
    "a caveat is in order here .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the measurement of the position of the bao peak from the correlation function relies somewhat on having assumed the @xmath0cdm model to convert angular distances in physical distances and in the computation of the reference ( smoothed ) power spectrum . as a consequence",
    ", one should use with caution the above value for @xmath132 when using a different cosmological model and rather directly fitting the measured correlation function .",
    "however , it is expected that the position of the bao peak does not change too much in a different model since it is measured at a relatively low redshift .",
    "since a full analysis will require the solution of the perturbation equations for our model ( which is outside our aims here ) , we will follow the common practice in literature neglecting this problem and directly using the @xmath132 parameter as an observational constraint included in the @xmath89 merit function .",
    "let us consider the fourth term in eq.([eq : defchi ] ) which relies on the _ shift parameter _",

    "wang & mukherjee @xcite have determined @xmath140 in very good agreement with what is expected for the concordance @xmath0cdm model .",
    "note that such a result may argue in favour of models with a negligible dark energy component at high redshift , but we defer this discussion to the later analysis of the results .",
    "finally , the term depending on @xmath83 in eq.([eq : defchi ] ) is only a gaussian prior on this quantity obtained by considering the model independent estimate of the hubble constant recovered by the hst key project @xcite .",
    "this collaboration have measured @xmath84 using a wide set of different local distance calibrators thus ending up with a value which is claimed to fully take into account any possible systematic error inherent to the peculiarities of each single method .",
    "comfortably , such a measurement turns out to be in good agreement with other ( less precise ) methods relying on different physics and distance scales as the time delay in lensed quasars @xcite and the sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite in galaxy clusters .    in order to maximize the likelihood function @xmath141",
    ", we should compute it over a very fine grid in the four dimensional parameter space @xmath142 and then interpolate the results for values falling in between two grid points .",
    "this is quite time consuming for a very fine grid so that we resort to a monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) method running three chains with 30000 points each and assessing the convergence using the gelman - rubin test ( with @xmath143 ) .",
    "it is worth stressing that , in order to be sure that the mcmc runs into the region with negative @xmath0 , it is better to reparametrize the model using @xmath144 instead of @xmath145 as model parameter using the obvious relation :    @xmath146    therefore , in the following , we will use @xmath147 as the parameter space to be explored by the mcmc code .",
    "after cutting the burn - in period , the final coadded chain contains @xmath148 points thus guaranteeing an efficient coverage of the interesting region of the parameter space allowing us to compute the marginalized likelihood functions for each parameter @xmath149 :    @xmath150    which is then normalized at unity at maximum . under the bayesian framework , the best estimated for the parameter @xmath149",

    "for the model we are considering , we conservatively let @xmath78 range between 0.15 and 0.45 , while the range for @xmath83 is @xmath164 . while the upper bound for @xmath144 is dictated by our constraint @xmath165 , choosing an upper limit",
    "is a more complicated issue .",
    "indeed , the scalar field and the negative cosmological constant may be incorporated in a single dark energy fluid ( as we will see later ) so that there is a degeneracy in balancing the two individual components .",
    "we therefore arbitrarily set @xmath166 thus allowing values of @xmath145 quite larger than 1 .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     let us first discuss some general points .",
    "first , we note that the best fit model is in quite good agreement with both the sneia and gas data .",
    "indeed , the @xmath89 values are respectively @xmath177 and @xmath178 to be contrasted witth the number of datapoints , being @xmath179 and @xmath180 respectively . less good , but still in satisfactory agreement with the observed ones , are the values for the acoustic peak and shift parameters being :    @xmath181    motivated by these results , we can",
    "therefore safely conclude that including a negative @xmath0 leads to a model still in agreement with the data so that this approach to halting eternal acceleration is a viable one from an observational point of view . in a sense , this is not surprising given that the net effect of the scalar field and negative @xmath0 is to provide a dark energy fluid with negative pressure dominating the energy budget .",
    "neveretheless , it is worth stressing that , while the one fluid model has to resort to a peculiar eos , the two fluids scenario relies on quite simple ingredients such as the exponential potential and well motivated cosmological constant .    comparing the best fit and median values of each parameter",
    ", it is soon clear that they are well different .",
    "this is , however , not a peculiarity of the model or the analysis , but rather a typical consequence of the non gaussian shape of the likelihood .",
    "since the full likelihood @xmath182 is not the product of the marginalized likelihoods @xmath183 , the best fit values @xmath184 are not given by the set of parameters that maximize each single @xmath183 .",
    "moreover , the marginalized likelihoods are markedly asymmetric so that the median values may be quite different from the maximum values .",
    "this is particularly the case for @xmath144 because of the constraint imposed by hand on the negativeness of @xmath0 .",
    "it is worth stressing , however , that all these caveats are common to the bayesian approach to every data fitting problem so that they have not to be considered as model shortcomings .    a successful fit to the data",
    "could , however , be meaningless if the estimated parameters take unrealistic values .",
    "it is therefore worth discussing how our constraints compare with other previous estimates .",
    "let us first consider , therefore , the matter density parameter @xmath78 .",
    "it is remarkable that the values in table i are larger than the wmap3 best fit model @xcite , being @xmath185 .",
    "taken at face values , the two results are markedly different , even if they well overlap at @xmath186 .",
    "it is worth stressing , however , that the wmap3 result reported above also depends on the cosmological model fitted to the data .",
    "for instance , adding the running of the spectral index to the fiducial @xmath0cdm scenario shifts upward the estimated @xmath78 now giving @xmath187 in better agreement with our constraint .",
    "moreover , our estimate also overlaps well with @xmath188 from fitting the chevallier - polarski - linder ( cpl ) model @xmath189 @xcite to a dataset similar to our own @xcite , but not inlcuding the gas data . as such",
    ", we are confident that the higher than usual matter content of our model is perfectly reasonable and do not consider this as a worrisome shortcoming .",
    "it is worth noting that a higher value for @xmath78 is somewhat expected .",
    "indeed , in order to compensate for the attractive effect of the negative cosmological constant , a higher than usual contribute from the scalar field is needed .",
    "but such a large @xmath145 should drive the universe towards a kind of superacceleration that needs to be compensated for by a larger matter content . the balance among these contrasting effects then induces a pushes @xmath78 towards larger values . as a final remark , we also note that the @xmath170 and @xmath171 ranges are quite larger , while typically @xmath78 is better constrained in literature . on one hand , this is a consequence of the degeneracy hinted above among three density parameters @xmath190 rather than the only two , @xmath191 , typically entering dark energy models . on the other hand",
    ", we are not using here either the cmbr spectrum which probes the very high redshift ( where @xmath78 is the dominant term ) or the lss data ( which are sensitive to the matter content ) .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the error we achieve on @xmath78 is so large .",
    "while it is meaningless to compare the value of @xmath144 to the other estimates in literature given that we are considering a negative rather than positive @xmath0 , one could naively think that @xmath64 should be compared to other determinations . however , it is easy to understand that this is not the case . referring to the cpl parametrization as a prototype for phenomenological eos and using a similar dataset as our own , davis et al .",
    "@xcite have obtained @xmath192 . compared with the values in table 1 ,",
    "we find only a marginal agreement at @xmath171 level .",
    "however , the cpl parametrization assumes a single dark energy fluid , while our model comprises two different fluids so that the two results are not comparable . qualitatively , the smaller is @xmath64 ( in absolute value ) , the smaller is the driving force speeding up the universe expansion so that one could be surprised that our model fits so well the data . actually , what really matters is not the eos , but rather than the pressure @xmath193 .",
    "considering its present day value , we have @xmath194 which compares qualitatively well to the cpl value @xmath195 .",
    "moreover , one should also take into account the different @xmath83 value which leads to different values of @xmath196 . considering that the difference somewhat fades away when integrating the hubble parameter to get the luminosity distance , it is therefore not surprising that the hubble diagram is almost the same betweem the one fluid phenomenological cpl model and our two fluids scenario .",
    "we do not discuss here the constraints on @xmath83 reported in table 1 since , as we have yet said above , this quantity is degenerate with the sneia absolute magnitude .",
    "note that @xmath83 does not enter either in the acoustic peak nor the shift parameters so that they do not help in breaking this degeneracy . on the other hand ,",
    "the gas mass fraction @xmath121 weakly depends on @xmath83 since it enters the function @xmath115 defined in ( [ eq : defaz ] ) trhough @xmath197 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath198 so that for @xmath118 , we get indeed a negligible effect . with all these caveats in mind ,",
    "we do not care much about our findings on @xmath83 which turns out to be lower than the @xmath199 preferred by the local measuremnts @xcite and cmbr data @xcite . motivated by these considerations",
    ", we have therefore marginalized over @xmath83 in the discussion of the results , although it is worth stressing that the difference between @xmath83 and @xmath200 has to be taken into account when comparing @xmath83 dependent quantities between the two models .    as a byproduct of the mcmc code",
    ", we can also estimate some interesting derived quantities to be contrasted again measurements in order to get some more tests on the viability of the model . to this aim ,",
    "given a quantity @xmath201 , we compute its value for the points belonging to the mcmc and estimate its median value and @xmath170 and @xmath171 ranges as described above . in order to both speed up the computation and reduce the correlation between neighbouring points , we have _ thinned _ the chains extracting one over eight points thus ending up with a sample of @xmath202 values which is enough to get reliable estimates .",
    "first , we discuss the results for the acoustic peak parameter whose median value and @xmath170 and @xmath171 ranges read :    @xmath203    pending the question about the validity of its measured value in models other than the @xmath0cdm one , we can therefore conclude that @xmath132 predicted by our scenario is in excellent agreement with what is inferred from the correlation function of lrg galaxies .",
    "it is nevertheless worth extending this analysis by computing the power spectrum and hence the correlation function predicted by our model , although this is outside our aims here .    as a second interesting quantity ,",
    "we consider the shift parameter for which we find :    @xmath204    these values being respectively the median and @xmath170 and @xmath171 ranges .",
    "a comparison with the measured value , @xmath140 , should make us conclude that the model is not able to fit this quantity .",
    "while this is somewhat expected on the basis of the equivalent dark energy model described in the next section , a more subtle issue has to be taken into account .",
    "looking at eq.([eq : defr ] ) and considering the constraints on @xmath78 in table i , it is easy to conclude that the problem with @xmath205 originates from @xmath206 .",
    "we have checked that this is indeed the case comparing @xmath130 for our best fit model with the @xmath0cdm curve .",
    "actually , @xmath130 deviates from @xmath207 more and more as @xmath92 increases .",
    "although worrisome , the smaller value of @xmath205 should not be considered as a strong motivation against our model . as explained in @xcite , @xmath205 is an approximation for the acoustic scale @xmath208 which is defined as :    @xmath209    with @xmath210 the sound speed .",
    "the shift parameter is obtained by @xmath208 using a different normalization and approximating the denominator as @xmath211 .",
    "this is correct only if the dark energy fades away with @xmath92 becoming subdominant at the last scattering .",
    "while this is true for the @xmath0cdm and standard quintessence models , this is not for our model as we will see in the next section .",
    "one should therefore compute @xmath208 for our case and compare with the estimated @xmath212 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we are unable to perform such a computation here because the numerical solution for @xmath213 and hence @xmath214 becomes seriously unstable for large @xmath92 . as a consequence , the integral in eq.([eq : la ] ) turns out to be unreliable so that we can not discuss anymore this point leaving it for further work .    as a final issue",
    ", we also consider the age of the universe .",
    "proceeding as before , we get ( in gyr ) :    @xmath215    with the same meaning as before for the values reported .",
    "compared with @xmath216 estimated for the concordance @xmath0cdm model from a combined analysis of the three - year wmap , sneia and bao data @xcite , our result is in very good agreement .",
    "it is nevertheless worth stressing that the wmap3 constraint is strongly model dependent so that one should better compare with the model independent measurements .",
    "however , krauss & chaboyer @xcite have estimated @xmath217 from globular clusters , while a similar value , @xmath218 , has been determined from nucleochronology @xcite . given the larger error bars , it is not surprising that our estimate is in very good agreement with these values too thus giving a further strong evidence in favour of our scenario .",
    "the model we are considering is made out of two _ non standard _",
    "fluids , namely a negative cosmological constant and a scalar field . from a phenomenological point of view , however , we can work out a model comprising a single dark energy fluid giving rise to the same expansion rate as the present one .",
    "ies eos may be evaluated as :    @xmath219 e^{-2}(u)}{1 - \\left ( \\omega_m { \\rm e}^{3u } + \\omega_r { \\rm e}^{4u } \\right ) e^{-2}(u ) } \\label{eq : wdeeff}\\ ] ]    so that the energy density may be then computed as :    @xmath220    fig.[fig : eosplot ] shows the reconstructed effective dark energy eos for our model setting the parameters @xmath221 to the best fit value determined by the mcmc code .",
    "there are some interesting issues than can be drawn from this plot .",
    "first , we note that @xmath222 and @xmath223 track each other being essentially equal , the two curves for @xmath223 and @xmath222 are almost perfectly superimposed so that they can be hardly distinguished .",
    "however , we have checked that the larger in @xmath144 ( in abslute value ) , the larger is the difference between the two eos . ]",
    "both in the late @xmath224 and early @xmath225 universe .",
    "this is not surprising since , for the best fit values we are using , the negative cosmological constant is quite small .",
    "however , a similar behaviour is obtained also for other values of the model parameters so that this is a rather common feature . as such , we will not investigate in detail how the shape of @xmath222 depends on @xmath226 , but our discussion below for the best fit model is nevertheless quite general .",
    "as it is apparent , @xmath222 can not be fitted by the most common phenomenological eos parametrization such as the cpl one . indeed , while for the cpl ansatz @xmath227 has a monotonic shape , in our model @xmath228 is not at all monotonic and actually also changes its sign .",
    "for the best fit model shown in the plot , @xmath222 first decreases down to the almost @xmath0cdm value @xmath229 for @xmath230 and then starts increasing crossing the dust value @xmath231 at @xmath232 to finally stays constant to the stiff matter value @xmath233 for @xmath234 .",
    "varying @xmath221 changes these values , but not the shape of @xmath235 which always asymptotes to 1 .",
    "notwithstanding this unusual feature , the present day values of @xmath235 and @xmath228 are well within the @xmath171 contours one can obtain when fitting the cpl formula to the same dataset we have used here .",
    "this is not unexpected given that , for @xmath236 , @xmath94 for a linear eos closely matches the luminosity distance - redshift relation predicted by our model .    as an alternative approach",
    ", one could resort to a model independent reconstruction of the eos ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . comparing @xmath235 in fig.[fig :",
    "eosplot ] with fig .",
    "3 ( right panel ) in @xcite shows us that the effective eos significantly departs from what can be reconstructed by the data .",
    "it is nevertheless worth noting that in both cases the eos asymptotes @xmath237 even if the transition is still more rapid in the case of the reconstructed eos because of the lack of the initially decreasing phase we have in our model .",
    "although troublesome , we are confident that the discrepancy between the reconstructed eos and our @xmath222 should not be considered as a strong evidence against the present model . indeed , data do not tell anything on @xmath238 directly , but only on the luminosity ( or angular diameter ) distance as function of the redshift . as such",
    ", one should not be worry about not reproducing a given @xmath238 , but the aim of the model must only be to fit the data with physically meaningful values of the model parameters .",
    "this task is successfully accomplished by our model so that we still retain it as a valid alternative to a single dark energy fluid scenario .    a potentially more worrisome problem is represented by the behaviour of the density parameter @xmath239 when compared to the matter one @xmath240 . as it is apparent from fig.[fig : omdeplot ]",
    ", @xmath239 closely follows @xmath241 being only slightly larger because of the need for compensating the negative cosmological consntat term . from this plot ,",
    "it is clear that the usual sequence dark energy - matter - radiation dominions is not realized in this model since the matter era is followed by another dark energy dominated epoch . as such",
    ", the model could be troublesome when dealing with the nucleosynthesis which takes place during the radiation era .",
    "indeed , it is usually claimed that , in order the bbn to be efficient , the constraints @xmath242 has to be imposed which is strikingly violated by our effective dark energy model .",
    "it is , however , worth noting that such a constraint usually refers to a negative pressure fluid , while @xmath235 is positive for our model . exploring whether bbn can take place in such",
    "a background is outside our aim here , but we will return later on this topic in the conclusions .    while the bbn epoch is far away in a redshift range where our model could not be trusted anymore ( for reasons explained later ) , structure formation typically probes a nearer epoch of the universe evolution . in the usual scenario ,",
    "the growth of structure takes place during the matter dominated era well after the universe has left the radiation epoch .",
    "however , in our case , the radiation dominated era has been replaced by a dark energy dominated one and , moreover , the matter term is the leading one for a shorter than usual period .",
    "for instance , in the concordance @xmath0cdm scenario , matter drives universe expansion from @xmath243 , while , for the best fit model in fig.[fig : omdeplot ] , the matter epoch starts later at @xmath244 . studying in detail the growth of structure and its impact on observable quantities such as",
    "the galaxy clusters mass function and abundance is outside our aims here and will be deeply investigated in a forthcoming publication .",
    "however , we can anticipate that this is a subtle issue .",
    "on the one hand , denoting with @xmath10 the matter density fluctuations , one usually has :    @xmath245    so that the dark energy only enters through its effect on the hubble parameter @xmath246 .",
    "as we have checked , @xmath247 decreases from @xmath248 to @xmath249 for @xmath92 ranging between the beginning ( @xmath250 ) and the end ( @xmath251 ) of the matter dominated era , taking @xmath252 for the concordance @xmath0cdm model . as such",
    ", we do expect that the growth index @xmath253 is almost the same as the @xmath0cdm one so guaranteeing a good agreement with this kind of data .",
    "however , eq.([eq : eqdelta ] ) is recovered assuming that dark energy does not cluster . while this is reasonable for a negative pressure fluid",
    ", this could not be the case for our model since its eos increases from the negative value @xmath254 to @xmath255 during the matter era .",
    "as such , the dark energy sound speed @xmath256 crosses the dust value @xmath257 . as such , it is likely that dark energy can partecipate to the collapse leading to structure formation thus invalidating eq.([eq : eqdelta ] ) and claiming for a coupled set of equations .    as a final issue",
    ", we would like to comment on a nice feature of the model .",
    "as it is apparent from fig.[fig : omdeplot ] , the presence of a dark energy dominated era before the matter epoch makes it possible to partially solve the coincidence problem .",
    "indeed , the ratio @xmath258 crosses the unit value two times in the universe history . as a consequence , @xmath259 changes by two order of magnitudes ( from 0.1 to 10 ) over the redshift range @xmath260 . converting the redshift into the dimensionless time @xmath261",
    ", we see that @xmath262 stays _ close _ to its present day value over most of the universe history thus significantly alleviating the coincidence problem .",
    "the likelihood analysis performed above has successfully demonstrated that the model we have introduced in sect.2 is able to reproduce the available astrophysical data .",
    "this encouraging result makes us confident that our approach to halting the eternal acceleration through the introduction of a negative cosmological constant is observationally well founded .",
    "nevertheless , a model comprising two dark ingredients ( the scalar field @xmath19 and the @xmath165 term ) may be considered as unsatisfactory because of the need to theoretically motivate two rather than one new fluids . moreover ,",
    "one of them is an unusual negative cosmological constant which is difficult to reconcile with the classical interpretation in terms of vacuum energy . as such",
    ", it is interesting to work out a possible reinterpretation of the model in terms of a radically different approach .",
    "fourth order theories of gravity have recently attracted a lot of attention as a valid alternative to explain cosmic acceleration without the need of any dark energy fluid .",
    "moreover , it has been developed a quick method to find out a @xmath1 theory giving the same cosmic dynamics of a given dark energy model .",
    "since all the tests we have considered above rely on the hubble parameter , it is obvious that the reconstructed @xmath1 theory will fit the data in the same way as the model discussed up to now .    here , we first summarize the basics of @xmath1 theories and the method of reconstructing the gravity lagrangian from the hubble parameter @xmath246 and then present the application to the model we are considering .",
    "much interest has been recently devoted to the so called curvature quintessence according to which the universe is filled by pressureless dust matter only and the acceleration is the result of the modified friedmann equations obtained by replacing the ricci scalar curvature @xmath18 with a generic function @xmath1 in the gravity lagrangian .",
    "the friedmann equations therefore read @xcite :    @xmath263   \\ , \\label{eq : hfr}\\ ] ]    @xmath264    where the prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath18 , @xmath265 is the energy density of an _ effective curvature fluid _ given as :    @xmath266 - 3 h \\dot{r } f''(r ) \\right \\ } \\ , \\label{eq : rhocurv}\\ ] ]    and the barotropic factor of the curvature fluid is :    @xmath267 } { \\left [ f(r ) - r f'(r ) \\right ] /2 - 3 h \\dot{r } f''(r ) } \\label{eq : wcurv}\\ ] ]    assuming that there is no interaction between matter and curvature terms , the continuity equation for @xmath265 reads @xcite :    @xmath268 ^ 2 }   a^{-3 } \\label{eq : curvcons}\\ ] ]    which is identically satisfied as can be easily shown using eq.([eq : hfr ] ) and expressing the scalar curvature @xmath18 as function of the hubble parameter :    @xmath269    combining eqs.([eq : hfr ] ) with eq.([eq : fried2fr ] ) and using the definition of @xmath270 , one finally gets the following _ master equation _ for the hubble parameter @xcite :    @xmath271 \\right \\ } \\ . \\label{eq : presingleeq}\\ ] ]    inserting eq.([eq : rvsh ] ) into eq.([eq : presingleeq ] ) , one ends with a fourth order nonlinear differential equation for the scale factor @xmath214 that can not be analitically solved also for the simplest cases ( for instance , @xmath272 unless dust matter contribution is discarded ) .",
    "moreover , although technically feasible , a numerical solution of eq.([eq : presingleeq ] ) is plagued by the large uncertainties on the boundary conditions ( i.e. , the present day values of the scale factor and its derivatives up to the third order ) that have to be set to find out @xmath214 by solving eq.([eq : presingleeq ] ) .    given these mathematical difficulties , a different approach has been proposed in @xcite ( hereafter cct ) where eq.([eq : presingleeq ] ) is considered as a way to determine @xmath1 rather than @xmath214 . rearranging the different terms suitably , cct obtained a linear third order differential equation for @xmath273 in terms of the redshift @xmath41 ( having set @xmath274 ) that can be easily solved numerically for a given @xmath246 . by this method , it is then possible to find out which @xmath1 theory reproduces the same dynamics of a given dark energy model , thus showing a formal equivalence between these two radically different approaches .",
    "cct developed the method using the redshift @xmath92 as integration variable since it is common to have an analytical expression for the hubble parameter as function of @xmath92 .",
    "however , this is not the case for the model considered here , so that it turns out to be numerically best suited to use @xmath24 as integration variable . to this aim",

    "first , let us remember that , in a fourth order theory , we may define an _",
    "effective gravitational constant _ as @xmath281 , with @xmath282 the usual newtonian gravitational constant .",
    "its rate of variation will be given as :    @xmath283    it is quite natural to assume that the effective and the newtonian gravitational couplings take the same values today , so that we get the condition :    @xmath284    evaluating eq.([eq : geffvar ] ) for @xmath285 ( i.e. , @xmath286 ) , we may determine @xmath287 provided an estimate of @xmath288 is given .",
    "since in our theory @xmath282 is constant , we may assume that the measurements of the variation of @xmath282 @xcite actually refers to @xmath289 and use these results to get an estimate of @xmath288 .",
    "we thus take as our boundary condition :    @xmath290    having used eq.([eq : in1 ] ) .",
    "finally , inserting eqs.([eq : in1 ] ) and ( [ eq : in2 ] ) into eq.([eq : rhocurv ] ) and then in ( [ eq : hfr ] ) evaluated today , we get :    @xmath291    from eqs.([eq : in2])-([eq : in0 ] ) , the following boudary conditions straightforwardly descend :    @xmath292    @xmath293    that have to be used , together with eq.([eq : in0 ] ) , to numerically solve eq.([eq : singleeq ] ) . combining the solution",
    "thus obtained for @xmath275 with @xmath294 evaluated through eq.([eq : rvsh ] ) , one finally finds @xmath1 thus recovering the higher order theory that mimicks the assigned dark energy model .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for some interesting examples .",
    "a preliminary comment is in order here , however . the dark energy model and its @xmath1 duality representation share the same expression for the hubble parameter @xmath246 ( and hence for the scale factor dependence on cosmic time ) . as such , all the observational tests relying directly on @xmath246 ( as the acoustic peak parameter @xmath132 ) or its integral ( as the luminosity distance or the age of the universe ) are not able to discriminate between a whatever dark energy model and its @xmath1 counterpart",
    "nevertheless , such an equivalence only holds at the background level . indeed ,",
    "since the underlying theory of gravity is radically different , at the perturbative level , the two models make clearly distinct predictions . as a consequence ,",
    "observational tests relying on the solution of perturbation equations ( such as the growth factor and the power spectrum ) could be able to break this degeneracy .",
    "actually , at the moment , observational determinations of the growth index @xmath295 are still quite noisy , while the uncertainties in the relation betwenn the observationally derived galaxy power spectrum and the theoretically predicted matter one still prevent from discriminating among dark energy and modified gravity .",
    "moreover , we only rely here on tests depending on @xmath246 so that the @xmath1 theory we will reconstruct is observationally equivalent to our two fluids scenario .",
    "all we need to apply the procedure described above is an expression for the hubble parameter @xmath270 as function of the cosmic time @xmath24 . for the model we are considering , this",
    "may be obtained numerically as described in sect.2 so that we only have to choose a value for @xmath296 in order to set the initial condition for @xmath287 .",
    "we fix @xmath297 in good agreement with most of the estimates in @xcite .",
    "we have also checked that changing this value within the quoted uncertainties does not affect significantly the main results .    before presenting the reconstructed gravity lagrangian",
    ", there is a conceptual point to clarify .",
    "the method described above represents a sort of _ bridge _ between two different scenarios . in particular",
    ", their matter contents could be different , so that we should define both @xmath298 and @xmath299 to denote this quantity in the two different models . in principle",
    ", there is no reason why @xmath300 should hold .",
    "however , since @xmath299 is close to the fiducial value ( @xmath301 ) suggested by model independent estimates ( e.g. , from galaxy clusters abundance ) , we take @xmath302 .",
    "should we have chosen a different value for @xmath298 , we have had a different reconstructed @xmath1 , but still providing the same hubble parameter as the model with the scalar field and the negative @xmath0 we have tested against data . to be more precise",
    ", one could say that our method is not able to recover a single @xmath1 , but rather a class of @xmath1 models parameterized by @xmath298 . an astrophysics based estimate of @xmath78 is the only way to break this degeneracy making it possible to select the most suitable member in this family of fourth order theories .",
    "with this remark in mind , we have performed the reconstruction of @xmath1 for the model presented in sect.2 setting its parameters @xmath303 to their best fit values . rather than reconstructing @xmath1 directly , it is more instructive to first consider :    @xmath304 { \\times } \\left [ \\frac{f(r)}{r } \\right ] _ { z = 0}^{-1 } \\label{eq : defeta}\\ ] ]    which is identically 1 for the einstein - hilbert lagrangian , @xmath305 .",
    "departures of @xmath119 from unity therefore quantifies how much the modified lagrangian should depart from the standard one in order to fit the data as well as the input hubble parameter .    to this aim",
    ", it is interesting to look at fig.[fig : etavsz ] where we report @xmath119 as function of @xmath92 over the redshift range @xmath306 , extending well above the one probed by the data we have used .",
    "it is apparent that @xmath119 quickly departs from 1 , i.e. the reconstructed @xmath1 dramatically differs from the einsteinian one .",
    "this is not unexpected at all",
    ". indeed , in order to fit the data with a matter only universe , one should strongly modifies the gravity lagrangian at least for values of @xmath307 corresponding to the accelerating expansion era . for larger values of @xmath92 ,",
    "the universe is decelerating so that one could naively expect to recover a standard situation with @xmath119 approaching @xmath170 .",
    "this is clearly not the case .",
    "actually , this somewhat counterintuitive result is easily explained reconsidering fig.[fig : omdeplot ] which shows that in our model dark energy dominates again after a finite period of matter domination . in order to recover this unusual behaviour , @xmath1 must still depart from the general relativity lagrangian .",
    "although the reconstructed @xmath1 is obtained numerically , it is useful to have an analytical approximation which we indeed find to be given by :    @xmath308 \\label{eq : approx}\\ ] ]    with @xmath309 , @xmath310 real parameters to be fitted to the numerical data .",
    "we have checked that such a formula reproduces the reconstructed @xmath1 within less than @xmath311 over the full redshift range we have probed . for the best fit model , we get :    @xmath312    changing the values of @xmath221 alters these values , but eq.([eq : approx ] ) still provides a very good approximation .",
    "we stress , however , that the approximating formula ( [ eq : approx ] ) has been tested only over the redshift range @xmath313 so that can not be extrapolated to larger values . as such",
    ", one has not to give any weight to the fact that @xmath1 does not reduce to @xmath18 in the very early universe as expected to recover the bbn succesfull results .",
    "it is interesting to consider the eos @xmath314 of the effective curvature fluid which is plotted in fig.[fig : wcplot ] .",
    "this plot shows that the curvature fluid actually behaves as a sort of usual cosmological constant with its eos increasing with resdshift , but still remaining quite close to the @xmath0 value @xmath315 over the full redshift range probed by the data",
    ". this result could be somewhat anticipated noting that the reconstructed @xmath1 theory provide the same @xmath246 and hence the same @xmath316 as the starting model . since this quantity stays within @xmath317 over the range @xmath306 , it is not surprising that the effective curvature fluid behaves as an almost @xmath0 term .",
    "however , we have checked that @xmath314 departs more and more from @xmath315 as @xmath92 increases even if we are not able to draw definitive conclusions because of the dramatical increase of the numerical noise .    as a final comment ,",
    "it is worth stressing again that the reconstructed @xmath1 provides the same cosmic dynamics ( i.e. , scale factor and hubble parameter ) of a model comprising both a quintessential scalar field and a negative cosmological constant . as a consequence ,",
    "being the background dynamics exactly the same , the @xmath1 model based on eq.([eq : approx ] ) predicts the same behaviour for the luminosity distance as function of the redshift @xmath92 ( and hence the same sneia hubble diagram and gas mass fraction vs @xmath92 curve ) and equal numerical values for the acoustic peak and shift parameters . as such , all the observational tests in sect .",
    "3 successfully met by the negative @xmath0 model are equally satisfied by its @xmath1 duality representation constructed here .",
    "such a fourth order theory is therefore able to both fit the available data and avoid eternal acceleration . in particular",
    ", the net effect is to mimic an unusual negative cosmological constant with a modified gravity lagrangian and no dark energy .",
    "this interesting result shows that a @xmath165 term could result as a net effect of forcing the gravity theory to be an einsteinian rather than a fourth order one .",
    "moreover , halting eternal acceleration is therefore possible without adding any _ ad hoc _ ingredient to the cosmic pie .",
    "the unprecedented high quality data accumulated in the recent years have depicted the scenario of a spatially flat universe presently undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion thus motivating the lot of interest devoted to the search of viable candidates to drive this cosmic acceleration .",
    "although many possible models have been put on the ground , almost all of them predict a two phase scenario with standard dust matter dominating the first epoch of decelerated expansion and a ( actual or effective ) dark energy fluid fueling the present day cosmic speed up . notwithstanding the underlying mechanism",
    ", the fate of the universe seems to be yet written . as matter fades away , dark energy becomes more and more dominant leading to an eternal acceleration so that serious problems arise with the formulation of the @xmath11 matrix and quantum field theory .    in an attempt to avoid these problems ,",
    "we have explored here a model made out of three rather than two ingredients . besides the usual dust matter and radiation and a scalar field responsible of cosmic acceleration , a negative cosmological",
    "constant has been added to the energy density budget .",
    "while being subdominant during the matter dominated decelerated phase and the scalar field dominated accelerated epoch , this new component may contrast the action of the quintessential scalar field during the future evolution of the universe . depending on the balance between these two terms ,",
    "eternal acceleration may be avoided leading to a big crunch collapse in a finite time .",
    "this possibility renders the model quite attractive from a theoretical point of view and have motivated us to further explore its viability through a comparison with the available astrophysical data . to this aim ,",
    "we have fitted the model to the most recent release of sneia data ( made out of data coming from the snls , essence and goods surveys ) and the gas mass fraction in galaxy clusters also setting a prior on the acoustic peak and shift parameters .",
    "this large dataset has been successfully reproduced thus showing that the presence of a negative @xmath0 is fully consistent with the data . as such ,",
    "our model may be considered as a viable solution to the problem of eternal acceleration .",
    "it is , however , worth investigating whether the same model may be interpreted as an effective representation of a radically different scenario .",
    "such a possibility is offered by fourth order theories of gravity according to which cosmic acceleration is the result of a modified gravity lagrangian with the scalar curvature @xmath18 replaced by an analytic function @xmath1 to be determined by the data .",
    "using a method developed by one of us @xcite , we have reconstructed @xmath1 by imposing that the cosmic dynamics is the same as the one determined by the action of the scalar field and the negative @xmath0 .",
    "since the hubble parameter is the same in both scenarios , both models are able to fit the data in the same way .",
    "moreover , the reconstructed @xmath1 does not include any cosmological constant term thus showing that a negative @xmath0 could also be the consequence of forcing a fourth order lagrangian to the linear einsteinian one .",
    "although encouraging , these results must be considered only preliminary .",
    "indeed , the model is affected by some undesirable shortcomings when applied to the early universe .",
    "first , the model turns out to be matter dominated only for a finite redshift range , while its expansion is scalar field driven during most of the high redshift range .",
    "moreover , the scalar field eos converges towards the stiff matter value @xmath237 so that one could worry about the growth of structure and the cmbr anisotropy spectrum .",
    "both these results are not fully unexpected .",
    "indeed , it has yet been demonstrated that an exponential potential may lead towards a scalar field dominated universe .",
    "our result shows that this conclusion also holds in the case a negative @xmath0 is present as could be predicted in advance noting that this term becomes quickly subdominant at large @xmath92 with respect to the matter and the scalar field ones .",
    "one could therefore consider the possibility to replace the exponential potential with a different @xmath20 using , e.g. , the sum of two exponential with opposite signs .",
    "suitably weighting the two terms may lead to a model which is similar to the present one at small @xmath92 thus giving the same successful match with observations . on the other hand , making the additional term dominant for large @xmath92 may solve the problems of the present model in the early universe .",
    "we stress , however , that here we have been more interested in looking for a model able to halt eternal acceleration .",
    "we have therefore paid more attention to the recent and future universe so that some problems with the early universe were foreseeable .",
    "the complicated task of matching the early , late and future expansion looking for a suitable potential will be addressed in a forthcoming work .",
    "further developments of the approach pursued here are possible from the observational and the theoretical point of view . on one hand , we have only tested the dynamics of the model , but severe constraints may be obtained investigating structure formation ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a discussion of this issue for the expoential potential model ) . to this aim , a first important step may be done solving the perturbation equation in the linear regime thus determining the growth factor @xmath318 and the growth index @xmath253 . since a negative @xmath0 has the same effect of an attractive gravitational potential , it is possible that the collapse of structures is enhanced so that it is worth investigating what constraints may be imposed by requiring that this effect does not change significantly neither @xmath319 nor @xmath273 with respect to the successful @xmath0cdm predictions .",
    "it is worth stressing , at this point , that which are the perturbation equations to solve depend on the scenario adopted .",
    "should we interpret the model in terms of @xmath1 theories , the standard theory of linear perturbations must be abandoned and different equations have to used .",
    "this gives us the possibility to select between the two equivalent descriptions retaining the one which predicts @xmath320 and @xmath321 most similar to the @xmath0cdm ones since they are more likely able to fit the large scale structure data .    on a different ground",
    ", one can arguably discriminate between the two components dark energy model and its @xmath1 duality representation based on solar system tests .",
    "indeed , in the low energy limit , the static and spherically symmetric solution of the einstein equations for the two components dark energy model leads to the usual newtonian potential ( apart some negligible deviations introduced by the tiny neative @xmath0 and the scalar field ) so that all the classical tests of gravity are automatically verified . on the other hand , the low energy limit of @xmath1 theories may lead to significant deviations from the newtonian potential .",
    "as such , these theories are indeed severely constrained by the solar system tests so that some models have been carefully designed just to evade this problem @xcite .",
    "although a strong debate is still present on which is the the correct way to work out the low energy limit of such theories , it is worth investigating this issue with some detail in a future work in order to see whether our approximated @xmath1 expression ( [ eq : approx ] ) is indeed viable from this point of view .",
    "should this not be the case , we could give it away , but still retaining the two components dark energy model as a viable way to halt eternal acceleration .",
    "a more _ philosophical _ comment is in order . along the work presented here ,",
    "we have first introduced a two components dark energy model comprising a negative @xmath0 and an exponential potential scalar field @xmath19 .",
    "after successfully testing it against the data , we have worked out its fourth order counterpart determining the function @xmath1 entering the modified gravity lagrangian giving the same cosmic expansion @xmath246",
    ". a guidance idea has been the occam s razor that suggests to give out models with an unnecessary large number of unknown elements .",
    "the price to pay has been to replace the simple general relativistic @xmath305 with a fourth order expression analytically approximated as in eq.([eq : approx ] ) .",
    "one could wonder whether such a complicated lagrangian may indeed be in line with the occam s razor spirit .",
    "actually , we are at the moment unable to find out a fundamental theory leading to our reconstructed @xmath1 , although some lagrangian containing the sum of terms with different powers of @xmath18 have been studied in literature ( see , e.g. , third reference in @xcite ) . should a fundamental theory not be found , one can indeed consider _ unnecessary _ our modification of @xmath1 and put our theory on the same ground as the two components dark energy model we have started from .    as a conclusive remark",
    ", we believe it is worth stressing that halting eternal acceleration is possible . using a two component model comprising a quintessential scalar field and a negative",
    "@xmath0 represents the easiest way to generate a transient cosmic acceleration .",
    "fourth order theories make it possible to interpret both these ( somewhat problematic ) terms as effective manifestations of a different scenario .",
    "the reconstructed @xmath1 may then be seen as the missing bridge between the easy world of many components models and the mathematically complicated structure of higher order gravity theories .",
