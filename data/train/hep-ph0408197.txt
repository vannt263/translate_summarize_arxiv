    "strong hadronic decays have been a subject of phenomenological investigations for several years  @xcite .",
    "the quark model description of strong decays is based on the assumption that decays originate from creation of a quark - antiquark ( @xmath3 ) pair in the gluonic field of the decaying meson .",
    "the produced @xmath3 pair subsequently recombines with the spectator constituents and hadronizes into the final state decay products .",
    "such a picture is consistent with the experimental observation that most hadronic decays involve a minimal number of final state particles in the final states ; this requires a small number of internal transitions at the quark level .",
    "furthermore , the absence of complicated multi - particle hadronic decays is also consistent with a minimal analyticity assumption for the scattering amplitude .",
    "the absence of complicated multi - particle cuts in the s - channel provides justification for a simple resonance regge pole parametrization of the t - channel amplitude over a wide s - channel energy range .",
    "the mechanism of @xmath3 pair production is by itself a complicated phenomenon , which can in principle be studied through lattice gauge simulations . in the strong coupling and/or non - relativistic limits ,",
    "pair production was shown to be similar to electron - positron production in a strong uniform electric field ( the schwinger mechanism )  @xcite . in this case",
    "the produced @xmath3 pair carries the quantum numbers of the vacuum , unit spin coupled to unit relative orbital angular momentum .",
    "a phenomenological hadron decay model based on such a @xmath3 production mechanism is referred to as the @xmath4 decay model ( the spectroscopic notation refers to the quantum numbers of the produced @xmath3 pair ) ; this model has been extensively used in phenomenological studies of meson and baryon decays .    within a non - relativistic or constituent quark model born - oppeinhemer approach",
    ", it is assumed that formation of gluonic field distributions decouples from the dynamics of the slowly moving constituent quarks .",
    "consequently the decay and formation of final state hadrons can be studied within a non - relativistic quantum mechanical framework  @xcite . for light quarks",
    "the non - relativistic approximation can be justified from the observation that dynamical chiral symmetry breaking leads to massive constituent quarks and transverse gluon excitations with a mass gap on the order of 1 gev  @xcite .",
    "this heavy , effective mass of gluonic excitations results in weak mixing between the valence and multi - particle fock sectors and suggests the validity of an approach to the decay process in which the pair production interaction is used only once .",
    "this is also consistent with the characteristics of the experimental data on decays discussed earlier .",
    "since fully dynamical lattice simulations of the light hadron resonances are not yet available , such a phenomenological approach seems to be a reasonable starting point towards a description of the strong decays of light hadrons .    in this paper",
    "we discuss some the remaining issues pertaining to models based on the ideas presented above .",
    "the first issue is the question of relativistic effects .",
    "even though a simple non - relativistic description appears to be quite successful in predicting decay widths of resonance with masses as large as 2 - 3 gev , the presence of light quarks moving with average velocities a substantial fraction of the speed of light naturally raises the question of the validity of the non - relativistic reduction . in the case of form factors",
    ", it has been demonstrated that relativistic effects in the quark model are in general quite large  @xcite .",
    "a study of relativistic effects in light - cone quantization has also recently been performed  @xcite . in the absence of a fully consistent dynamical model",
    ", one could argue that these effects might somehow be mocked up by effective parameters , nevertheless if one seeks a more `` universal '' constituent quark model of hadronic properties , it is essential to address the role of relativistic corrections in decays .    secondly , as discussed above since the @xmath4 decay model can be related to the characteristics of a wilson loop , in a consistent description of a decay process one should consider hadrons including flux tube degrees of freedom and the effects of flux tube breaking  @xcite .",
    "the majority of models of normal hadron decays do not include such effects . in those models",
    "the strong decay amplitude is determined by the quark model constituent wave function , multiplied by a form factor representing pair production that is independent of the quark distribution in the parent hadron .",
    "this would not be the case for a general string breaking mechanism .",
    "a simple phenomenological picture of hadrons and their decays in terms of quantum mechanical wave functions emerges naturally in a fixed gauge approach .",
    "for example , in the coulomb gauge the precursor of flux tube dynamics , including string breaking , originates from the non - abelian coulomb potential , which also determines the quark wave functions  @xcite .",
    "the string couples to the @xmath3 pair via transverse gluon emission and absorption in the standard way .",
    "this coupling carries @xmath5 quantum numbers .",
    "it is interesting to investigate whether this coupling , combined with the flux tube dynamics , is consistent with the phenomenological @xmath4 picture discussed above .",
    "if one were to attempt a description of decays based on coulomb gauge quantization , it is necessary to address the role of the hybrid quark - antiquark - gluon configurations , since these appear as intermediate states in the decay process as illustrated in fig .",
    "if such hybrid states also exist as asymptotic states they would provide an invaluable insight to the dynamics of confined gluons . in recent years , evidence has been presented that such states do indeed exist , in particular in exotic channels that do not mix with the @xmath3 sector  @xcite .",
    "recently the non - relativistic @xmath4 decay model has been extended to study hybrid meson decay , modeled via a @xmath3 pair coupled to a constituent , non - relativistic string ( a `` flux - tube '' )  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore desirable to compare the `` universal '' decay picture of @xmath3 and @xmath6 mesons emerging from the coulomb gauge , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , with the exotic meson decay phenomenology based on models of flux tube breaking .",

    "the gluons connecting the coulomb lines represent formation of the flux tube , the gluon string in the ground state .",
    "the overall state depicted is enclosed by the solid oval .",
    "emission of a quark - antiquark pair from a gluon leads to a re - adjustment of the gluon strings and formation of the normal mesons in the final state . in the lower diagram the hybrid meson state appears as an intermediate state in a normal meson decay , which is assumed to proceed via mixing of a @xmath3 pair with virtual excitation of a gluonic string and its subsequent decay .",

    "the lightest exotic hybrids , which by definition do not mix with the ground state @xmath3 configuration , correspond to states built on top of the first excited adiabatic potential .",
    "the gluonic configurations can be classified according to symmetries of the @xmath3 system , similar to the case of a diatomic molecule .",
    "the strong interaction is invariant under rotations around the @xmath3 axis , reflection in a plane containing the two sources , and with respect to the product of parity and charge conjugation ; thus each configuration can be labeled by the corresponding eigenvalues denoted by @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 respectively . in the ground state",
    "the gluonic flux tube has @xmath12 and in the first excited state it has one unit of spin , @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore in the first excited configuration , lattice simulations find @xmath14 for the gluon cloud  @xcite    in the coulomb gauge the quantum numbers of gluonic states can be associated with those of the extra transverse gluon in the presence of a static @xmath3 source .",
    "this is because the transverse gluons are dressed  @xcite , and on average behave as constituents with effective mass @xmath15@xcite .",
    "thus low lying excited gluonic states are expected to have a small number of transverse gluons . the flux tube itself is expected to emerge from the strong coupling of transverse gluons to the coulomb potential .",
    "the transverse gluon wave function can be obtained by diagonalizing the net quark - antiquark - gluon interactions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( in addition to the gluon kinetic energy ) .     two - body ( left ) and three - body ( right ) potential between the transverse gluon and the static @xmath3 sources .",

    "[ fig2 ] is of particular relevance . if the gluon is in a relative @xmath16-wave with respect to the @xmath3 system it has a net @xmath17 , which is opposite to the lattice results for the first excited configuration .",
    "however , the transverse gluon has a gradient coupling to the coulomb potential , thus a @xmath18-wave transverse gluon receives no energy shift from this coupling and the energy of the @xmath16-wave gluon state is increased . in the coulomb gauge picture , the shift of the @xmath16-wave state via this 3-body interaction may be the cause of the inversion of @xmath19 levels seen on the lattice  @xcite",
    ". a quantitative analysis of this effect will be the subject of a separate investigation . in the following , when considering the wave function of an exotic hybrid we will assume that the transverse gluon is in a @xmath18-wave relative to the @xmath3 state .      in this analysis we do not solve the coulomb gauge qcd hamiltonian to obtain meson wave functions .",

    "the non - relativistic limit is obtained when the quark masses are large compared to the quantities @xmath84 and @xmath233 .",

    "the relation between @xmath259 and @xmath228 ( or between @xmath231 and @xmath260 ) is more complicated and depends on the orbital angular momentum wave functions @xmath78 and @xmath261 . if @xmath216 then in the non - relativistic limit @xmath1 will not decay into @xmath209 .",

    "there is good agreement for small momentum transfer ; the discrepancy for larger @xmath293 indicates the lack of sufficient high momentum components in our wave function .",

    "our predictions give a value less than @xmath308 for this ratio in the @xmath181 model , and close to @xmath32 for the @xmath309 decay . the real mechanism for this decay appears to lie somewhere between the two predictions .",

    "the ratio @xmath311 is respectively @xmath312 . in the non - relativistic limit one obtains similar results .",
    "it is clear that treating @xmath8 as @xmath313 increases dramatically the @xmath311 ratio ; therefore this may be an important component of the wave function .",
    "the relatively small values of the decay widths of a @xmath8 with @xmath314 quantum numbers ( l=2 ) compared to those of a @xmath8 with pion quantum numbers ( l=0 ) remind the situation for the process @xmath315 , whose d - wave width was small compared to the s - wave .",
    "in this work we studied relativistic effects for the decays of normal and exotic mesons , and discussed a new picture of meson decays in the coulomb gauge point of view . in coulomb gauge",
    "the gluon degrees of freedom are physical .",
    "since they carry color , isolated gluons do not appear in the physical spectrum , and colorless excitations of @xmath6 states are expected to be suppressed by a mass gap of the order of @xmath316 .",
    "this is what lattice qcd studies find for the energy of gluonic excitations in the presence of @xmath3 sources . since",
    "strong decays are expected to proceed via gluon decay into a @xmath3 pair , the coulomb gauge provides a natural framework for disentangling the dynamics of bound state formation ( via a static coulomb potential ) and the decay of the gluonic component of a state .",
    "this work led to two important conclusions .",
    "first , numerical results showed significant relativistic corrections arising from spin - orbit correlations introduced by wigner rotation .",
    "the widths calculated using fully relativistic formulae are in general larger than the corresponding values calculated with no wigner rotation ( by a factor of roughly 10% ) , but smaller than completely non - relativistic rates .",
    "some decays that are suppressed in the non - relativistic limit ( for example @xmath317 assuming identical orbital wave functions for @xmath173 and @xmath7 ) acquire non - zero amplitudes in the relativistic case .",
    "the second conclusion from this work is that the lightest exotic meson , the @xmath1 , prefers to decay into two mesons , one of which has no orbital angular momentum while the other has @xmath47 ( the so - called @xmath318 selection rule )  @xcite .",
    "thus this selection rule , also found in other models seems to be quite robust  @xcite .",
    "some decays ( @xmath195 , @xmath303 , @xmath319 ) are suppressed by symmetries in orbital wave functions , or the assumption that the parameter @xmath84 should be almost equal for mesons with the same radial quantum numbers . we have also noticed that , for decays where two waves are possible , the rates for the higher partial waves are larger in the @xmath4 than in the @xmath5 model .",
    "however , there is one caveat that needs to be explored further .",
    "there are several components to the @xmath6 normal meson wave functions and if there are sizable contributions from wave functions with large relative angular momentum in the @xmath3 system , it is possible to obtain large amplitudes for high partial waves .",
    "this has in particular been illustrated in the case of the d - wave / s - wave ratio for the @xmath305 decay .",
    "the process @xmath317 seems to be suppressed and this agrees with the @xmath318 selection rule  @xcite .",
    "however , some models predict larger values for its width  @xcite .",
    "it is possible that these are increased by the final state interactions between the outgoing mesons .",
    "the most important contribution may come from the process @xmath320 , that proceeds through an @xmath224 exchange .",
    "calculations of this contribution will be the subject of future work .",
    "the authors wish to thank j.  narebski and s.  glazek for several discussions .",
    "this work was supported in part by the us department of energy under contract de - fg0287er40365 and national science foundation grant nsf - phy0302248 .",
