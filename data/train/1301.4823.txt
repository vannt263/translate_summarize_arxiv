    "the non - local character of quantum correlations is manifested by the violation of bell s inequality @xcite , and , more generally , of the so - called chsh inequality @xcite .",
    "the experimental violation of these inequalities @xcite constitutes by now an important part of modern scientific culture .",
    "this property and its relation to entanglement has in fact become one of the cornerstones of quantum information theory , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the relation between bell s inequalities and convex geometry is also well - known : it has been studied somewhat independently in the mathematical physics literature @xcite , ( * ? ? ? * appendix a ) , @xcite , @xcite and in the statistics literature @xcite . in particular , bell s inequalities are known to be related to the representation of a polytope as intersection of halfspaces .",
    "nevertheless , the problem of finding a minimal set of bell - like inequalities is in general still open as it relates to the hard problem of finding all the facets of a polytope @xcite .    the purpose of this note is to show that , in the simple but important original case of @xmath0 spin random variables , the fact that bell s inequalities provide a facets representation of the polytope of all spin correlation matrices can be proven in a direct , straightforward way using the available description of the extreme points @xcite .",
    "this elementary derivation , which is apparently missing in the large body of literature on this topic , only works in the @xmath0 case .",
    "in such a case , and for no other @xmath1 , the polytope is actually a simplex , so that it constitutes a _ tetrahedron _ , see figure [ tetrahedron ] .",
    "let @xmath2 be a @xmath3-dimensional real vector space .",
    "we denote by @xmath4 the _ affine hull _ of @xmath5 , namely the intersection of all linear manifolds in @xmath2 containing @xmath6 .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath7 we denote by @xmath8 the _ convex hull _ of @xmath6 , namely the intersection of all convex sets containing @xmath6 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath9    a convex set @xmath10 is a @xmath11-_simplex _ if @xmath12 and the points @xmath13 are _ affinely independent _ ,",
    "i.e. @xmath14 .",
    "necessarily , @xmath15 .    if @xmath16 is a @xmath11-_simplex _ , every point @xmath17 admits a _ unique _ representation as convex combination of the points @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , @xmath18 , the set of _ extreme points _ of @xmath16 , is indeed @xmath19 .",
    "a set @xmath20 which is the convex hull of a finite number of points is called a _ ( convex ) polytope_.    consider a family of spin random variables @xmath21 with @xmath22 and form the corresponding column vector @xmath23 , where @xmath24 , @xmath25 denoting transposition .",
    "the random vector @xmath23 has zero expectation and takes values in @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath27 denote the corresponding covariance / correlation matrix .",
    "given the @xmath28 , the question whether the corresponding matrix can be realized as the correlation matrix of spin random variables is a nontrivial one . indeed , while any symmetric , positive semidefinite matrix @xmath29 can be realized as the covariance of a gaussian random vector , the conditions on @xmath29 become much more stringent if we require realization through spin random variables . since @xcite , it is known that for three spins variables , the @xmath28 need to satisfy bell s inequalities to be realizable . actually , it was shown in @xcite that , in the case @xmath30 , bell s inequalities @xmath31 are necessary and sufficient for the matrix @xmath32 to be the correlation matrix of @xmath33 spin random variables .",
    "notice that a correlation matrix is symmetric and has ones on the main diagonal .",
    "it is therefore determined by the elements above the main diagonal .",
    "hence , these matrices are in one to one correspondence with a @xmath34-dimensional euclidean space . for @xmath35 ,",
    "let @xmath36 denote the set of correlation matrices that can be realized through spin random variables .",
    "pitowsky @xcite and gupta ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem3.1 ) showed that @xmath36 is a _",
    "polytope_. it consists namely of all convex combinations of a finite number of correlation matrices .",
    "they also gave an explicit description of the extreme points ( matrices ) of this set .",
    "these are rank-@xmath37 matrices of the form @xmath38 , where the @xmath33-dimensional vector @xmath39 has entries equal to @xmath37 or @xmath40 .",
    "notice that @xmath39 and @xmath41 generate the same correlation matrix so that there are @xmath42 different such matrices .",
    "since a polytope simply consists of all convex combinations of its extreme points , this completely characterizes @xmath36 .",
    "by the minkowski - weyl theorem @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix a ) , a polytope , besides being the convex hull of its extreme points ( v - representation ) , can also be dually described as the intersection of half - spaces through a system of linear inequalities ( h - representation ) .",
    "for instance , a triangle in the plane is the intersection of three half - planes determined by the straight lines containing its sides .",
    "it is known @xcite that the latter description for @xmath36 is related to the bell s inequalities ( [ bellsinequalities ] ) .",
    "consider now the @xmath0 case , where ( [ bellsinequalities ] ) take the form @xmath43    the set @xmath44 is a @xmath45-simplex , namely a tetrahedron .",
    "bell s inequalities ( [ bell1])-([bell4 ] ) provide the h - representation of the tetrahedron @xmath44 .",
    "thus , any element in @xmath44 satisfies bell s inequalities ( [ bell1])-([bell4 ] ) .",
    "conversely , any correlation matrix satisfying bell s inequalities belongs to @xmath44 .    consider the four vectors @xmath46 by @xcite ,",
    "the extreme points of @xmath44 are given by the four matrices @xmath47,\\quad \\sigma_2=v_2v_2^t=\\left[\\begin{matrix}+1 & -1 & + 1\\\\ -1 & + 1 & -1\\\\ + 1 & -1 & + 1\\end{matrix}\\right],\\\\ & & \\sigma_3=v_3v_3^t=\\left[\\begin{matrix}+1 & + 1 & -1\\\\ + 1 & + 1 & -1\\\\ -1 & -1 & + 1\\end{matrix}\\right],\\quad\\sigma_4=v_4v_4^t= \\left[\\begin{matrix}+1 & -1 & -1\\\\ -1 & + 1 & + 1\\\\ -1 & + 1 & + 1\\end{matrix}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] consider now a symmetric matrix @xmath29 with ones on the main diagonal .",
    "as observed before , they can be bijectively mapped onto a @xmath45-dimensional space .",
    "let @xmath48,\\quad x=\\left[\\begin{matrix}1\\\\ \\sigma_{12}\\\\ \\sigma_{13}\\\\ \\sigma_{23}\\end{matrix}\\right].\\ ] ] knowledge of @xmath49 is equivalent to knowledge of @xmath29 .",
    "define @xmath50.\\ ] ] then bell s inequalities ( [ bell1])-([bell4 ] ) simply state that the vector @xmath51 belongs to the positive orthant @xmath52 , it has namely all nonnegative components . consider a symmetric , @xmath53 matrix @xmath29 with ones on the main diagonal expressed as _ linear _ combination of the @xmath54 : @xmath55 since @xmath56 and the @xmath57 have the same property , it follows that necessarily @xmath58 namely @xmath29 is in @xmath59 . from ( [ form ] ) , a simple calculation yields @xmath60=a\\left[\\begin{matrix}\\lambda_1\\\\ \\lambda_2\\\\ \\lambda_3\\\\ \\lambda_4\\end{matrix}\\right].\\ ] ] observe that @xmath61 is involutory , namely @xmath62 .",
    "since @xmath6 is invertible , it follows that any symmetric matrix with ones on the main diagonal may be expressed as in ( [ form ] ) .",
    "in particular , every element in the convex hull of @xmath63 admits a unique representation .",
    "hence , the @xmath57 are affinely independent and generate a simplex , namely a tetrahedron .",
    "moreover , we have @xmath64=4\\left[\\begin{matrix}\\lambda_1\\\\ \\lambda_2\\\\ \\lambda_3\\\\ \\lambda_4\\end{matrix}\\right].\\ ] ] thus bell s inequalities are _ equivalent _ to having @xmath65 . taking ( [ form ] ) and ( [ sum ] ) into consideration , we conclude that a convex combination of the @xmath54 is a correlation matrix satisfying bell s inequalities .",
    "namely , any element in @xmath44 satisfies bell s inequalities ( [ bell1])-([bell4 ] ) .",
    "conversely , any correlation matrix satisfying bell s inequalities belongs to the convex hull of the @xmath54 , i.e. it belongs to @xmath44 .",
    "the above elementary argument does not extend to higher dimensions .",
    "in particular , @xmath36 is not a simplex for @xmath67 .",
    "for instance , we know from @xcite that also in the case @xmath68 bell s inequalities are necessary and sufficient for @xmath29 to be realizable as correlation matrixof spin random variables . there are @xmath69 such inequalities .",
    "the set @xmath70 has eight extreme points whereas @xmath29 is determined by six elements ( those above the main diagonal ) .",
    "but , in a @xmath71-dimensional space , a simplex can have at most @xmath72 extreme points .",
    "thus the polytope @xmath70 is not a simplex . more generally , the equation @xmath73 relating the number of extreme points of @xmath36 and the maximum number of affinely independent points in a space of dimension @xmath34 has no solution for @xmath67 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath74 , bell s inequalities ( [ bellsinequalities ] ) are known not to be sufficient for a correlation matrix to be the correlation matrix of spin random variables @xcite ."
