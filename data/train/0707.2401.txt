    "the main contribution to the franck - condon factors with @xmath54 can therefore be attributed to the long - range portions of the wavefunctions .",

    "fig : wvfct ] ) due to the resonant coupling leads to significant franck - condon factors with the ground - state levels @xmath59 , in particular with @xmath50 and 114 . since the @xmath2 eigenfunction with @xmath60@xmath36",

    "moreover , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fcf ] , the franck - condon factors of the coupled - state @xmath2 eigenfunction of binding energy @xmath57  @xmath36 with the ground state levels @xmath50 and 114 differ only by a factor of about 2.7 and 2.3 , respectively , from the franck - condon factor with the second to last level , @xmath54 . while the levels @xmath50 and 114 are highly excited , their binding energies are much larger than that of @xmath54 ( @xmath63@xmath36 and 6.86@xmath45@xmath36 , respectively , compared to @xmath64@xmath36 @xcite ) . the outermost peaks of the corresponding vibrational wavefunctions occur at about 21.4  @xmath49 and 22.2  @xmath49 .",
    "this leads to the second important conclusion : molecule formation in these more strongly bound ground - state levels is almost as efficient as in the very last levels just below the dissociation threshold .",
    "this appears to resolve a puzzle raised in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was observed that the vibrational populations of levels near @xmath65 are much higher than can be explained by franck - condon factors calculated using the uncoupled @xmath3 potential curve .",
    "the experimental setup has previously been described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . it consists of a @xmath0rb mot , which is loaded to a density of approximately 10@xmath66 @xmath67 using a `` dark - spot '' @xcite configuration .",
    "the estimated mot temperature is  200 @xmath68k . a cw tunable ti : sapphire laser ( coherent 899 - 29 ) with an output power of more than 400 mw is focused into the mot for photoassociation",
    ". the photoassociated ultracold molecules spontaneously decay to the ground state , @xmath6 , which is subsequently detected by resonance - enhanced two - photon ionization using a pulsed dye laser ( continuum nd 6000 ) pumped by a 532 nm nd : yag laser at a 10 hz repetition rate .",
    "the detection laser beam has a 1 mm diameter and a typical pulse energy of 3 mj with a pulse duration of 7 ns .",
    "the molecular ions that it forms are accelerated into a channeltron detector and discriminated from atomic ions by their time of flight .    with the pa laser frequency fixed on a resonance , the pulsed - detection laser can be scanned in the range of 601 - 603 nm to obtain the vibrational spectrum of the ground - state molecules . since the theory of resonant coupling predicts an oscillatory behavior of the number of formed molecules as a function of pa laser detuning , we repeat the experiment for nine different pa laser detunings , each time obtaining a detection laser scan . to compare more clearly the effect of resonant coupling for these different pa laser detunings ,",
    "we normalize each detection spectrum by the fractional pa trap loss measured at the same pa laser detuning .",
    "more details regarding the normalization are given in section iv .",
    "a limitation of this detection method is that it can not detect the very highest vibrational levels , because they can be photodissociated indirectly via off - resonant re - excitation by the pa laser after they are formed .",
    "this indirect photodissociation process is discussed in detail in ref .",
    "there it was observed that only levels up to @xmath69 can be observed , even though the formation rate for high-@xmath9 levels should have been very large . in the present work",
    "we confine our analysis to levels with @xmath70 , for which we estimate that losses due to this process should be minor .",
    "another experimental limitation is that a small background signal level is observed even in the absence of the pa laser , probably due to formation of high-@xmath9 ground - state molecules by the mot laser itself . after noting this issue in our first data set , we included in a second data set explicit measurements of this background signal , taken by scanning the detection laser without the presence of the pa laser .",
    "this background level can be subtracted from each ion spectrum .",
    "however , we note that the first data set can not be so corrected , and also that the subtraction may over - correct for the real background contribution , since the presence of the pa laser may cause indirect photodissociation of the high-@xmath9 molecules comprising the background , causing it to diminish whenever the pa laser is present",
    ". thus we use in our analysis the average of the uncorrected and corrected signals , and we take the difference between the two to be upper and lower bounds when estimating the experimental uncertainties .",
    "two sets of experimental data were taken on different dates .",
    "detection laser spectra were obtained for each of nine different detunings @xmath71 of the pa laser , including the four examples shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rawdata ] .",
    "the data include all of the pa transitions in the range @xmath72  @xmath36 that are sufficiently strong and free from overlaps with unrelated transitions to allow reliable results . in this range ,",
    "theory predicts two pairs of maxima and minima for formation of molecules due to the resonant coupling phenomenon .",
    "assignment of the vibrational levels @xmath9=112 - 116 is based on our previous study of the formation of the singlet molecules in the ground @xmath12 state @xcite .",
    "ionization signals for binding energies of ( a ) 6.02@xmath45@xmath36 ( min ) ( b ) 9.39@xmath45@xmath36 ( max ) ( c ) 11.27@xmath45@xmath36 ( min ) , and ( d)16.27@xmath45@xmath36 ( max ) are shown .",
    "for easy comparison , the vibrational levels @xmath9 are marked by vertical lines . ]    to show the enhancement of ultracold molecule formation in the @xmath6 ground state due to resonant coupling , we compare the production of ground - state molecules for different pa laser detunings .",
    "however , the production rate involves both the efficiency of the pa step and the efficiency of the spontaneous emission ( se ) step , as is apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : potentials ] .",
    "only the latter process is of interest to the present analysis .",
    "fortunately the effects of the two processes can be distinguished by using trap loss measurements to determine the pa rate .",
    "production of excited molecules by pa results in trap loss with nearly 100% probability , either by formation of ground - state molecules or by decay back into the continuum with enough kinetic energy gain to escape from the trap . when the pa laser is tuned to a resonance , the formation rate @xmath73 of excited - state molecules is given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the mot loading rate , @xmath76 is the steady - state number of atoms in the mot in the absence of the pa laser , and @xmath77 is the change in number due to the pa laser .",
    "therefore , the formation rate of excited - state molecules is proportional to the fractional trap loss with the assumption that the mot parameters are fairly constant .",
    "thus we can correct for variation in the pa rate at different pa laser detunings , by normalizing the ground - state molecule signal by the corresponding fractional trap loss . in a typical data set ,",
    "this fractional loss varies from 18% to 27% over our range of detunings . as explained previously",
    ", we also sum together the signals ( peak heights ) from ground - state levels with @xmath9=112 - 116 to average over nodal fluctuations in the franck - condon factors .",
    "a small systematic error can occur because the detection laser beam intensity is not always sufficient to saturate the first step of the detection process , the bound - bound @xmath78 transition .",
    "therefore , we consider two limiting cases .",
    "first , we assume that the transition is completely saturated",
    ". then the ionization signal should directly reflect the franck - condon factors for the @xmath79 transition .",
    "second , we assume that there is no saturation at all . in this case",
    "the ionization signal must be normalized by the franck - condon factors for the first detection step , @xmath80 .",
    "because the extent of saturation was not well - controlled during the measurements , we use the average of these two limiting cases as our final experimental result .",
    "the difference between them , which fortunately is small compared to the random experimental scatter , is taken as the associated systematic uncertainty .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fcfoscillations ] , the final experimental results for radiative decay rates to levels with @xmath23 are compared with theory . because the overall scale is arbitrary , we choose for each data set a multiplicative scaling factor selected to minimize the standard deviation between theory and experiment .",
    "the typical systematic error bars shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fcfoscillations ] is estimated by taking the quadrature sum of the systematic uncertainties due to background subtraction and incomplete detection laser saturation .",
    "it does not include the effects of random variations and day - to - day variations in the mot , which are apparent in the scatter between the two independent data sets .",
    "the overall oscillatory behavior due to resonant coupling is very apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : fcfoscillations ] , and the positions of the minima and maxima coincide closely with the theoretical predictions . however , the ratio between the maximum and minimum molecule formation rates is somewhat smaller than predicted by theory , about 5:1 as opposed to 20:1 .",
    "this may arise from additional perturbations not taken into account in our two - state model , although it also may be due in part to experimental issues such as the effects of weak overlapping transitions and the saturation effects described above .",
    "we also note that the relative populations of the individual vibrational levels @xmath9 exhibit variations different from the predicted franck - condon factors , even though the broader distributions are well - predicted , indicating that the model is not quite sufficient to predict the exact nodal positions in the vibrational wavefunctions .",
    "we have presented clear theoretical and experimental evidence for resonant enhancement in the photoassociative formation of ultracold @xmath0rb@xmath1 molecules in the ground @xmath21 state .",
    "the basic mechanism , enhancement of radiative 0@xmath81 decay by resonant coupling of the 0@xmath82 and 0@xmath83 states , is similar to that previously observed for cs@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "a range of pa transitions was investigated with detunings of @xmath84 @xmath36 below the @xmath5 atomic asymptote .",
    "a mapped grid method was used to obtain vibrational wavefunctions to predict relative molecule formation rates , and experiments were performed to measure these rates .",
    "the oscillatory behavior of the ground - state molecule population has been revealed more clearly than in the prior experimental work on cs@xmath1 .",
    "this was accomplished by normalizing the experimental results to remove variations in pa rates and by integrating the formation rates for several vibrational levels to remove local nodal oscillations in the franck - condon factors .",
    "agreement between theory and experiment is quite good , except that the observed contrast of the resonant enhancement phenomenon is somewhat less than predicted .",
    "the enhanced production of ground - state molecules in the vibrational levels @xmath23 should be quite useful for future experimental studies .",
    "in particular , vibrational levels with binding energies of several wavenumbers present a much better starting point for additional raman transitions to obtain molecules in their vibronic ground state than levels with sub-@xmath36 binding energies @xcite .",
