    "inflation was introduced as a natural and simple way of solving the problems of classical cosmology - the initial conditions problem ( or the flatness and horizon problems ) and the explanation of the origin of primordial density fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the easiest way to obtain inflation is by introducing a single scalar inflaton field with a slowly evolving vacuum expectation value @xcite . in order to obtain a proper period of big bang nucleosynthesis",
    "however , one has to end inflation by particle production .",
    "the process of reheating must connect the inflaton sector to the observable sector @xcite.in order to properly describe inflation and particle production one has to consider the underlying theory of particles and interactions .",
    "supersymmetry is one of the most promising extensions of the standard model ( sm ) @xcite , and it has triggered a search for supersymmetric models of inflation and reheating .",
    "one of the typical features of supersymmetric extensions of the sm is the presence of flat directions @xcite - directions in field space , along which the scalar potential identically vanishes in the limit of unbroken global supersymmetry . due to large quantum fluctuations or the classical evolution of fields during inflation flat directions",
    "can easily acquire large vevs @xcite .",
    "therefore , there is a natural question about the role of such large vevs in the process of particle production.it was postulated in ref .",
    "@xcite , that large flat direction vevs influence the process of particle production by blocking preheating from the inflaton - the phase of rapid , non - perturbative inflaton decay . in ref .",
    "@xcite a simple toy model was proposed @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the inflaton field , @xmath2 parameterizes the flat direction and @xmath3 represents the inflaton decay products ( in this model a direction in higgs fields has been considered ) . then , after mode decomposition of the field @xmath3 , the energy of the mode with momentum @xmath4 is given by : @xmath5 in general , non - adiabatic production of particles @xmath6 is efficient only when @xmath7 changes non - adiabatically @xmath8 where the adiabaticity parameter @xmath9 is introduced . during classical preheating @xmath7",
    "is dominated by the inflaton vev and changes non - adiabatically due to inflaton oscillations . in the presence of flat directions",
    "however , @xmath7 could be dominated by the large vev of the flat direction .",
    "if this vev changes very slowly in comparison with the evolution of the inflaton vev , non - perturbative production of @xmath3 particles is effectively blocked.however , as was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , blocking of preheating from the inflaton does not occur when non - perturbative production of particles from the flat direction itself is possible .",
    "then the initially large vev of the flat direction decreases rapidly , unblocking preheating from the inflaton . in ref .",
    "@xcite a method was introduced of calculating the amount of particles produced non - perturbatively from the flat direction , due to non - adiabatic changes of the mass matrix eigenvectors and eigenvalues related to quantum fluctuations around the flat direction .",
    "this led to a discussion ( see refs @xcite ) about whether non - perturbative decay of flat directions and preheating from the inflaton is possible .",
    "the discussion was based on some general properties of flat directions in a global supersymmetry framework .",
    "it did not consider any specific model of inflation and did not propose any model of acquiring large vevs by flat directions .",
    "therefore it was difficult to study the whole issue and determine how the large vevs of flat directions develop and evolve , and how they impact the process of inflation and particle production.the goal of our work is to construct a consistent model of inflation and particle production in a realistic supersymmetric extension of the standard model , and consider in this specific model the behavior of mssm flat directions .",
    "therefore a realistic chaotic inflation model with two representative flat directions is constructed . in order to be able to predict the evolution of flat direction vevs it was decided to study the production of large flat direction vevs by classical evolution during inflation , and therefore a potential for the flat direction",
    "is required .",
    "following refs @xcite we adopt the supergravity framework with a non - minimal khler potential , which results in a potential for the flat direction with a time - evolving minimum at large vevs during inflation",
    ". it also enables us to calculate the previously neglected influence of supergravity corrections for flat direction evolution during inflaton oscillations .",
    "we also consider the impact of existence of non - renormalizable terms , which has also been neglected so far .",
    "we find that these effects strongly influence the process of particle production by introducing efficient channels of non - perturbative particle production both from the flat direction and the inflaton . as a result",
    "the originally large flat direction vevs are diminished , preheating from the inflaton is allowed and the energy density of the universe is dominated by the inflaton decay products .",
    "the model considered in this paper , after neglecting all fields except for the inflaton , reduces to the simplest chaotic inflation model with the inflaton potential @xmath10 .",
    "this property together with inflaton domination provides appropriate slow - roll inflation and a value of spectral index which is in agreement with the wmap5 data @xcite .",
    "obtaining such a property in a model which is based on supergravity is not straightforward due to complicated supergravitational f - terms .",
    "a solution to this problem ( the so called @xmath11-problem ) was proposed by @xcite and is used in this paper . according to the solution , except for the chiral inflaton superfield @xmath12 and the mssm superfields , the model contains one additional chiral superfield @xmath13.further consideration is restricted to scalar fields and the same symbol is used to denote both the chiral superfield and its complex scalar component .",
    "the following decomposition in real fields is used @xmath14 @xmath15 the field @xmath1 plays the role of the inflaton.we follow @xcite in constructing the khler potential @xmath16 and take @xmath17 the formula ( [ kh ] ) for the khler potential was obtained by @xcite as follows .",
    "the first step was to introduce a nambu - goldstone - like shift symmetry of the inflaton @xmath2 @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a dimensionless real parameter .",
    "a khler potential which is invariant under this symmetry and the additional @xmath20 symmetry must have the general form @xcite @xmath21 .",
    "\\label{kgen}\\ ] ] the formula ( [ kh ] ) is just the lowest order term in the general expansion of the formula ( [ kgen ] ) .",
    "it can be easily seen that a theory with an exact nambu - goldstone - like shift symmetry has no potential for the inflaton @xmath1 .",
    "therefore this symmetry has to be broken , but not in the khler potential in order to avoid the @xmath11-problem .",
    "following @xcite , we introduce a shift symmetry breaking term in the superpotential @xmath22 @xmath23 it gives mass @xmath24 to the inflaton @xmath1.there are two mssm - flat directions considered in this paper : a direction @xmath25 in higgs fields ( only d - flat ) and a direction @xmath26 in squark fields , where indexes @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath4 are some family indexes ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "let @xmath3 be the complex scalar field that parametrize the @xmath25 direction @xmath30 let @xmath2 be the complex scalar field which parametrizes the @xmath26 direction @xmath31 in equation ( [ phiflat ] ) @xmath32 are fixed color indexes .",
    "the components of fields @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 with other color indexes are equal to zero .",
    "it is convenient to decompose the complex fields @xmath3 and @xmath2 into real fields in the following way @xmath36 @xmath37the full khler potential is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a standard minimal khler potential and @xmath40 is a non - minimal part of the form @xmath41 here @xmath42 is the planck mass and @xmath43 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "the existence of couplings like @xmath40 is guaranteed in the presence of yukawa couplings , since they are necessary counterterms for operators generated by loop diagrams @xcite .",
    "terms in @xmath40 cause the existence of minima in the scalar potential for both flat directions , which are of the order of @xmath42 . therefore flat directions can naturally aquire large vevs of the order of @xmath42 by falling into these minima .",
    "for the superpotential we take @xmath44 the term @xmath45 is one of only two possible renormalizable couplings between the field @xmath13 and msugra fields .",
    "the second one is @xmath46 .",
    "these two couplings can not coexist in the model unless r - parity is broken .",
    "we assume that the inflaton does not couple to mssm fields in the khler potential and in the superpotential to avoid strong deviations from the slow - roll inflation regime with inflaton domination .",
    "the term @xmath47 is the standard mssm superpotential , given by @xmath48 the last term @xmath49 is a non - renormalizable part of the superpotential and it has the following form @xmath50 here @xmath51 and @xmath52 are dimensionless constants and @xmath53 is a right - handed neutrino of any given generation .",
    "two non - renormalizable terms contained in @xmath49 are the only terms of 4th order in the fields , which may be relevant for the evolution of vevs of the two chosen flat directions .",
    "the term @xmath54 gives no contribution to the scalar potential , unless one additionally considers vevs of some other flat directions.terms in @xmath49 modify minima for flat directions , which are shifted away from zero in the scalar potential due to terms in @xmath40 .",
    "the minima are no longer close to @xmath42 when coupling constants @xmath51 and @xmath52 are sufficiently large . moreover ,",
    "they evolve in time during inflation until they reach their final position at zero at the end of the inflaton oscillations.the soft susy - breaking terms in the scalar potential have negligible effects on our results.our initial conditions are set for the time which corresponds to about 100 e - folds before the end of inflation , since only this period is essential for preheating .",
    "initial values for the real fields @xmath1 , @xmath11 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 do not require fine tuning . for the inflaton field @xmath1 the only condition which needs to be satisfied is @xmath58 .",
    "it ensures that the number of e - folds is greater than 75 , which is needed for inflation to solve the horizon problem and the flatness problem @xcite .",
    "we took the initial value @xmath59 to consider only the last 100 e - folds before the end of inflation .",
    "fields @xmath11 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 should be initially smaller than @xmath42 because they are present in khler potential , especially in the exponential factor @xmath60 in the f - terms . therefore initially large values of any of those fields should decrease rapidly and the vevs of the fields @xmath11 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 should stay confined naturally below the planck scale during inflation . in particular the vev of field @xmath11 falls to zero very quickly and , as we have checked numerically , does not have any noticable influence on the evolution of other fields .",
    "therefore in our final calculations we simply put @xmath61 .",
    "the evolution of the field @xmath55 has also almost no influence on the evolution of other fields , so we set for it a quite arbitrary initial value @xmath62 .",
    "fields @xmath56 and @xmath57 which are absolute values for complex flat direction fields @xmath2 and @xmath3 are initially taken to be of the order of the hubble parameter @xmath63 , which is also the order of initial quantum fluctuations for those fields during inflation . in the slow - roll regime with inflaton domination",
    ", we have @xmath64 . after setting @xmath65 as in the simplest model of slow - roll inflation consistent with wmap data we get @xmath66",
    ". therefore we take @xmath67 .",
    "in order to study the process of acquiring large vevs by flat directions one has to consider the classical evolution of fields during inflation . a classical description is possible due to the slow - roll character of the evolution . at the end of inflation , excitations around vevs of the fields",
    "will be considered in order to determine the impact of large flat direction vevs on the process of particle production.the classical evolution is determined by the equations of motion derived from the supergravity lagrangian once the initial conditions have been set .",
    "the inflaton equation of motion has the simple form @xmath68 during inflaton domination the main contribution to the scalar potential v is of the form @xmath69 , which provides a standard chaotic inflation background . due to the shift symmetry",
    "the khler potential does not depend on @xmath1 , and so the supergravity coefficient @xmath70 does not contain the inflaton field .",
    "this solves the @xmath11-problem and allows for high - scale inflation .",
    "since only the last 80 - 100 e - folds of inflation have any observable consequences for the evolution of the universe , the initial value of the inflaton vev was chosen in a way that allows the study of this period of inflation . due to the absence of any coupling of the inflaton with the @xmath25 and @xmath71 directions in the khler potential ( because of the shift symmetry ) the evolution of the inflaton is largely independent of the evolution of the flat directions . because of this property the process of acquiring large vevs by @xmath71 or @xmath25 directions will not spoil inflation.the equations of motion for x , @xmath71 and higgs fields are more complicated due to the non - minimal form of the khler potential for these fields .",
    "one can expect however that the field vevs will evolve toward a minimum of the scalar potential .",
    "the scalar potential in supergravity is complicated as well .",
    "however one can observe that all the field vevs except for the inflaton vev are naturaly confined below the planck scale due to the @xmath70 factor in the scalar potential .",
    "this factor becomes dominant in the scalar potential at the planck scale .",
    "therefore the scalar potential for all fields except the inflaton rises steeply at the planck scale as @xmath72 . as a result one can expect @xmath73 to be less than unity and expand the scalar potential in these fields . for field",

    "the evolution of @xmath55 is naturally confined to low vevs due to the supergravity term @xmath70 which exponentially steepens the potential for field x at the planck scale .",
    "the evolution of all other fields of the model is independent of the choice of initial conditions for @xmath55 and on the evolution of this field .",
    "the only role of field @xmath13 in the model is providing appropriate scalar potential for the inflaton and both flat directions.in the global mssm without corrections coming from supergravity or non - renormalizable terms the scalar potential is independent of the flat direction @xmath79 . adding the corrections mentioned above",
    "creates a potential for the flat direction .",
    "a term quadratic in @xmath2 in the scalar potential is created by supergravity effects and is sensitive to any non - minimal couplings in the khler potential . in the model presented in this paper",
    "the quadratic term mentioned above takes during inflaton domination ( neglecting the complex fields phases ) the following approximate form @xmath80\\right).\\ ] ] in the equation above the parameter @xmath43 describes the influence of the non - minimal coupling in the khler potential . in supergravity with a minimal khler potential",
    "the scalar potential has a global minimum at zero for the flat direction . in this case",
    "acquiring large flat direction vevs due to classical evolution is impossible .",
    "the non - minimal coupling enables us to shift the minimum toward larger vevs by an appropriate choice of @xmath81 .",
    "then the coefficient of the term quadratic in @xmath56 in the scalar potential becomes negative for @xmath82 .",
    "for the purpose of numerical calculations we set @xmath83 .",
    "the exact location of the minimum is determined by higher - order terms in @xmath56 , which come from both supergravity and non - renormalizable terms .",
    "supergravity alone stabilizes the minimum around @xmath42 due to the coefficient @xmath70 .",
    "the presence of a non - renormalizable term scaled by @xmath52 shifts this minimum toward lower vevs , changing the predicted flat direction vevs at the end of inflation toward lower values . in order to study the effect of large flat direction vevs on the process of particle production the value of @xmath52 should not exceed unity.supergravity corrections and non - renormalizable terms have a similar effect on the potential for the @xmath25 direction .",
    "the interplay between @xmath51 and @xmath52 determines the differences between the evolution of the two flat directions ( @xmath25 and @xmath71 ) under consideration .",
    "we study two specific scenarios    1 .   if @xmath84 then the @xmath71 direction vev becomes large and the @xmath25 direction vev drops to zero during inflation , which corresponds to the scenario described in ref .",

    "if @xmath85 then both directions can acquire large vevs during inflation and the impact of non - zero vevs of the inflaton classical decay products on the process of particle production and blocking of preheating by flat direction large vevs can be studied .    by `` large vev ''",
    "we mean a vacuum expectation value of the order @xmath86 , which is large in comparison with the hubble parameter @xmath87 at the beginning of inflaton oscillations .",
    "since the acquired value of the @xmath88 or @xmath25 direction vev is determined by the value of @xmath52 and @xmath51 respectfully , in order to create large vevs of those directions during inflation @xmath52 and @xmath51 should not exceed unity .",
    "for the purpose of numerical calculations two sets of @xmath89-parameters are considered    1 .",
    "@xmath90 and @xmath91 2 .",
    "@xmath92 and @xmath91 .    in order to check",
    "if classical evolution can lead to large flat direction vevs during inflation we have chosen small initial vevs for both directions , which correspond to the average size of quantum fluctuations typical for the considered period of inflation ( @xmath93 ) . in order to obtain numerical predictions in specific scenarios",
    "one has still to fix two free parameters .",
    "the choice of the inflaton mass @xmath94 is natural because it implies a spectral index of energy density fluctuations consistent with wmap observations .",
    "following the arguments of ref .",
    "@xcite we choose the inflaton coupling parameter @xmath95 to be small and of the order @xmath96.the classical evolution of fields obtained numerically in the two scenarios mentioned above is presented below .",
    "it turns out that in both cases the evolution of field @xmath11 is irrelevant - the vev of the @xmath11 field decreases rapidly to zero and does not influence the further evolution of the other fields .",
    "henceforth we simplify our calculations by setting @xmath97 .",
    "preliminary numerical calculations show that in this case some of remaining 7 real vevs ( after setting @xmath97 ) can be also neglected .",
    "first of all the scalar potential does not depend on the phase @xmath98 and any initial velocity of this phase will fall to zero due to the hubble friction term . therefore the flat direction @xmath71 can be effectively described by only its absolute value @xmath56 .",
    "the vev of the field @xmath57 , the absolute value of higgs flat direction , after an initial increase , falls to zero quite rapidly .",

    "the final 100 e - folds of inflation are studied.the inflaton vev evolves according to standard chaotic inflation .",

    "after the initial rise this vev starts decreasing and drops to zero rapidly during the first 35 e - folds of inflation .",
    "this effect is shown in figure ( [ pic5 ] ) and is caused by the relatively large value of @xmath51 ( @xmath91 ) with respect to @xmath52 , which favors the creation of large @xmath71 direction vev .",

    "a comparison with the time evolution of the inflaton vev clearly shows that the time evolution of this eigenvalue is dominated by the behavior of the inflaton .",

    "non - perturbative particle production due to the time evolution of the mass matrix eigenstates is not necessary to reduce flat direction vev and unblock preheating .",
