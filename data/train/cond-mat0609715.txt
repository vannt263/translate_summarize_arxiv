    "this is the third theoretical paper on magnetization steps ( mst s ) from a strongly diluted heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice . the first paper ( also called i )",
    "was based on the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) cluster model , or 1 model . the second paper ( also called ii ) discussed `` generic '' and `` specific '' cluster models with two antiferromagnetic ( af ) exchange constants .",
    "the generic 1 - 2 model placed no restriction on the ratio @xmath9  between the second - largest and largest exchange constants .",
    "similarly , there was no restriction on the ratio of the exchange constants in the two specific models that were considered : 1 ) the 1 - 2 and the 1 - 3 models , where @xmath3 is the exchange constant with the @xmath4th neighbor .",
    "numerical simulations of the magnetization curve , @xmath10 versus @xmath11 , and of the derivative curve , @xmath12  versus @xmath11 , were also carried out in ii .",
    "the pattern of the peaks in the derivative curve was defined as the `` mst spectrum . '' for the 1 - 2 model the simulated spectra indicated that when the ratio 2 is `` very small '' the spectrum has the following features :    1 .",
    "the spectrum consists of a low - field part and a high - field part .",
    "the two parts are separated by a `` gap '' in which there are no discernable spectral lines .",
    "the magnetization curve exhibits a plateau in the field region of the gap .",
    "this plateau corresponds to the apparent saturation in the 1 model .",
    "3 .   in the high - field part of the spectrum ,",
    "each spectral line that exists in the 1 model may , and usually does , develop a fine structure ( fs ) .",
    "separations of spectral lines in this fs are of order @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the secondary reduced magnetic field , defined by eq .",
    "( 3b ) of  ii .",
    "the corresponding separations @xmath15 are of order @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the g - factor and @xmath18 is the bohr magneton . 5 .",
    "typical line separations @xmath19 in the low - field part of the spectrum are also of order @xmath20 .    when the ratio 2 in the 1 - 2 model is sufficiently small that the spectrum has the five features listed above , the model is called `` lopsided . ''",
    "the lopsided 1 - 3 model is defined in a similar manner .",
    "the relevant small ratio is then 3 , and line separations @xmath15 in the high - field fs , and in low - fields , are controlled by 3 .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the lopsided 1 - 2 and 1 - 3 models . among the topics that will be discussed",
    "are :    1 .",
    "the numerical criteria that the ratios 2 and 3 must satisfy in order for 1 - 2 and 1 - 3 models to qualify as lopsided ; 2 .",
    "the concepts of `` skeleton '' and `` decoration , '' for the exchange - bond structure of clusters ; 3 .",
    "connections between many features of the mst spectra and the relevant skeletons and decorations ; 4 .",
    "features of the spectrum that are most useful for measuring the second - largest exchange constant .    as in i and ii",
    ", the present paper includes extensive numerical simulations of mst spectra .",
    "the simulations are only for magnetic ions with spin @xmath7 , and only for zero temperature , @xmath21 .",
    "some simulations at finite @xmath22 are included in the following paper as a part of the data analysis .    in calculations of the spectra ( @xmath12   vs @xmath11 ) the infinite sum in eq .",
    "( 2 ) of  ii is truncated at the maximum cluster size @xmath23 , and the remainder is ignored . in simulations of the magnetization @xmath10 , on the other hand , the remainder is approximated by the corrective quintets ( cquin s ) method .",
    "this method is described in appendix  [ a : a ] .",
    "in order for a 1 - 2 cluster model to qualify as `` lopsided , '' the ratio @xmath9  must satisfy two numerical criteria : a `` general criterion '' and a `` gap criterion . ''",
    "the general criterion is @xmath24 that is , the two exchange constants must differ by at least one order of magnitude .",
    "the `` gap criterion '' requires the ratio @xmath9  to be sufficiently small that a gap , with no spectral lines , separates the low - field and high - field parts of the spectrum .",
    "in contrast to the general criterion , the gap criterion depends on @xmath25 , on the maximum cluster size @xmath26at which the sum in eq .",
    "( 2 ) of  ii is truncated , and , in principle , also on the specific cluster model .",
    "these dependencies cause the gap criterion to be more complicated than the general criterion . both the general criterion and the gap criterion must be satisfied .",
    "the more stringent of the two criteria is the `` governing criterion '' that a model is lopsided .",
    "the criteria for the existence of a gap in the 1 - 2 and 1 - 3 models were obtained only for @xmath7   and only for @xmath27 .",
    "it turned out that at least for these values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the numerical criterion that the ratio 3 must satisfy in order for the 1 - 3 model to be lopsided is the same as the criterion for the ratio 2 in the 1 - 2 model .",
    "therefore , only the ratio 2 in the 1 - 2 model will be discussed in detail .",
    "the first step was to obtain a necessary condition that the ratio 2 must fulfill in order for a gap to exist .",
    "this condition depends on @xmath26 .",
    "numerical simulations then showed that for @xmath28 and @xmath29 the necessary condition is also sufficient , so that it is the gap criterion . for @xmath30 and @xmath31 , however , the necessary condition is not quite sufficient .",
    "a minor adjustment was therefore required to obtain the gap criterion .",
    "cluster types that give rise to mst s in the 1 - 2 model belong to three categories : pure-1 , pure-2 , and `` mixed . ''",
    "only the last category involves both @xmath32 s .",
    "the gap is in the total spectrum , from all cluster types of all categories .",
    "the necessary condition for a gap was obtained by considering only the spectrum from the pure cluster types , i.e. , mixed cluster types were excluded .",
    "the pure-2 cluster types produce spectral lines only in the low - field part of the spectrum . on the other hand ,",
    "the pure-1 cluster types produce lines in the high - field part of the spectrum .",
    "a necessary condition for a gap is that the highest @xmath11 for any mst from the pure-2 cluster types is below the lowest @xmath11 for any mst from the pure-1 cluster types .",
    "the pure-2 cluster types are all the cluster types of the ( parent ) 2 model .",
    "the pure-1 cluster types are a known subset of the cluster types of the ( parent ) 1 model .",
    "the two parent models are isomorphic ( see appendix a of  ii ) . for any choice of @xmath26 , only lines from cluster types with sizes @xmath33 are considered .    for @xmath7 , the primary reduced fields @xmath34 at the mst s from each cluster type of the 1 model",
    "are given in table ii of  ref .  .",
    "the secondary reduced fields @xmath14 at the mst s from the isomorphic cluster types in the 2 model are the same . for cluster sizes not exceeding @xmath35 and @xmath31 , the highest value of @xmath14 is @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "the lowest @xmath34 is @xmath38 when @xmath39 or @xmath29 , and @xmath40 when @xmath30 or @xmath31 .",
    "expressing @xmath41 and @xmath42 in terms of @xmath11 , the necessary condition for a gap is @xmath43 .",
    "thus , the necessary condition for @xmath44 is @xmath45 , respectively",
    ".      the sufficient condition for a gap was obtained from numerical simulations that also included the mixed cluster types . for @xmath39 and @xmath29 , the necessary condition was found to be sufficient .",
    "therefore , the gap criterion for @xmath39 is @xmath46 . for @xmath47 ,",
    "the gap criterion is @xmath48 .    when @xmath26   is either @xmath49 or @xmath31 , the sufficient condition for a gap is slightly more stringent than the necessary condition .",
    "the reason is that among the lines in the high - field part of the spectrum , the line with the lowest @xmath34 is from a mixed cluster , not from a pure-1 cluster .",
    "the relevant mixed - cluster type is 4 - 3 ( 4 - 1 in the 1 - 3 model ) .",
    "including the lowest @xmath34 from this cluster type , the gap criterion for @xmath30 is @xmath50 .",
    "for @xmath23 , the gap criterion is @xmath51 .",
    "the more stringent of the general criterion and the gap criterion is the governing criterion . for @xmath28 and @xmath29",
    "the governing criterion is the general criterion , @xmath52 . for @xmath30 and @xmath31 , on the other hand , the gap criterion is the governing criterion .",
    "the governing criterion is therefore @xmath50 for @xmath53 , and @xmath51 for @xmath23 .",
    "the selection of @xmath26   in the calculation of the spectrum depends on several considerations .",
    "one is that @xmath26   can not exceed the largest size of clusters whose hamiltonians can be diagonalized with available resources .",
    "sometimes , however , @xmath26   is chosen to be lower than the upper limit of technical capabilities , because the labor of calculating the spectrum is reduced substantially .",
    "because spectral lines from cluster types with sizes @xmath54 are lost in the simulation , a choice of a lower @xmath26   implies a greater loss of spectral lines .",
    "however , this greater loss is not always significant",
    ". if the concentration @xmath55 of the magnetic ions is sufficiently low , only a negligible fraction of the total number of magnetic ions are in clusters with @xmath56 . in the present paper , all the calculated spectra",
    "are based on the choice @xmath23 .",
    "the mst spectrum can always be obtained numerically using the procedures described in ref .  . quite often",
    ", however , the numerically - obtained spectrum does not immediately reveal some of the underlying physics .",
    "a major goal of the present paper is to expose the connections between many features of the mst spectrum and the exchange - bond structures of the relevant clusters .",
    "the discussion below is mainly for the lopsided 1 - 2 model .",
    "the physics of the lopsided 1 - 3 model is very similar .",
    "three categories of cluster types give rise to mst s in the 1 - 2 model : pure-2 cluster types , pure-1 cluster types , and mixed cluster types .",
    "the spectra from the pure cluster types have already been discussed in sec .",
    "[ ss : iib ] .",
    "therefore , the mixed cluster types are the main ( but not the only ) focus of the remaining discussion in this paper .",
    "the majority of all spectral lines are , in fact , from mixed cluster types .",
    "the concepts of `` skeleton '' and `` decoration '' are central to the discussion of the exchange - bond structure of mixed cluster types .",
    "they are not essential concepts for pure-1 cluster types . however , the use of these concepts both for mixed and for pure-1 cluster types has the advantage of a more uniform presentation .",
    "the common feature of mixed and pure-1 clusters is that each such cluster contains at least one 1 bond . in the physical picture that will be adopted here ,",
    "any cluster with at least one 1 bond consists of a skeleton and a decoration .",
    "the following definitions and properties for the lopsided 1 - 2 model also apply to the lopsided 1 - 3 model .",
    "all that is necessary is to replace `` 2 '' by `` 3 . ''",
    "consider a cluster with at least one 1 bond .",
    "the skeleton of this cluster consists of all the 1 bonds in the cluster together with all the spins that are attached to these 1 bonds .",
    "the much weaker 2 bonds , if any are present , are never included in a skeleton . some spins in the skeleton ( called `` skeleton - spins '' ) may be attached to 2 bonds .",
    "but even in such cases the 2 bonds are not included in the skeleton .    the cluster types of the 1 - 2 model were shown in figs .  1 and 2 of the preceding paper .",
    "figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] of the present paper are revised versions of the same figures .",
    "the revisions emphasize the skeletons .",
    "skeleton - spins are represented by solid circles , in contrast to other spins which are shown as empty circles .",
    "the 1 bonds ( always included in the skeleton ) are represented by solid lines , whereas the 2 bonds ( never considered as parts of the skeleton ) are shown as dotted lines .",
    "the cluster types of the 1 - 3 model were shown earlier in figs .  3 and 4 of ref .  .",
    "revised versions of these figures , which emphasize the skeletons , are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] of the present paper .",
    "the format is similar to that in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , except that dotted lines represent 3 bonds .",
    "skeletons are either `` simple '' or `` compound . ''",
    "a skeleton is simple if and only if all the skeleton - spins are connected to each other by a continuous path ( or paths ) of 1 bonds . for a compound skeleton",
    "there are at least two skeleton - spins which are not connected by a continuous path of 1 bonds .",
    "because these two spins are still in the same cluster , they must be connected by at least one continuous path of exchange bonds , but such a path must include at least one 2 bond .",
    "examples of compound skeletons are cluster type 4 - 12 in 1 , and cluster types 5 - 36 up to 5 - 41 in 2 .",
    "a compound skeleton always consists of two or more `` fragments . ''",
    "all spins in the same fragment are connected by a continuous path ( or paths ) of 1 bonds .",
    "any continuous exchange path between spins in different fragments must include at least one 2 bond .",
    "all cluster types in figs .",
    "[ fig1][fig4 ] contain no more than 5 spins .",
    "each fragment must contain at least two spins .",
    "therefore , any compound skeleton in these figures has two fragments , with 2 or 3 spins in each fragment .",
    "consider simple skeletons first . by itself , any simple skeleton is identical to some realization of one of the cluster types of the 1 model .",
    "this cluster type of the 1 model is chosen as the type of the simple skeleton .",
    "the label for the skeleton type is also the same as the label for the cluster type in the 1 model ( as defined in ref .  ) , except that it is surrounded by a parenthesis and is followed by a subscript `` @xmath57 . '' for example , a simple skeleton which is identical to a nn pair in the 1 model is a skeleton of type @xmath58 . in the 1 model",
    "the cluster type gives the complete set of 1 bonds in the cluster .",
    "similarly , the type of a simple - skeleton gives the complete set of 1 bonds in the simple skeleton .",
    "compound skeletons also are classified by types . as a first step ,",
    "each fragment is assigned a `` fragment type . ''",
    "the procedure is similar to the assignment of a type to a simple skeleton .",
    "the fragment type gives the complete set of 1 bonds in the fragment .",
    "for the compound skeleton as a whole , the skeleton type is given by the sequence of the fragment types .",
    "the order in the sequence is arbitrary .",
    "for example , the compound skeletons of quintet types 5 - 36 , 5 - 37 , and 5 - 38 in 2 are all composed of two fragments : a nn pair and a nn triplet .",
    "these are cluster types @xmath59 and @xmath29 of the 1 model ( see fig .  3 of  ref .  ) .",
    "the compound skeletons of the three mentioned cluster types in 2 are therefore of type @xmath58-@xmath60 or , alternatively , @xmath60-@xmath58 .",
    "figures [ fig1][fig4 ] are arranged so that cluster types with the same skeleton type appear in the same row .",
    "the skeleton type is given in the left column .",
    "the cluster types in the bottom row of each of these figures have no 1 bonds .",
    "therefore , they have no skeletons .",
    "any mixed cluster has both a skeleton and a decoration .",
    "the decoration consists of all the exchange bonds that are not in the skeleton , together with all the spins that are not in the skeleton , if there are any such spins . for a mixed 1 - 2",
    "cluster type the decoration includes all the 2 bonds , and all the spins that are not attached to any 1 bond .",
    "each decoration - spin must be attached to at least one 2 bond ; otherwise it would have been a single , and not a spin in a mixed 1 - 2 cluster . in figs .",
    "[ fig1][fig4 ] the decoration spins are among the spins that are represented by empty circles",
    ".    decorations of mixed 1 - 2 cluster types may be divided into two classes :    1 .",
    "`` spinless decorations '' ( also called pure - bond decorations ) contain no spins .",
    "they consist only of 2 bonds .",
    "all the spins of the cluster are then in the skeleton . therefore , all the 2 bonds are between skeleton - spins .",
    "examples of spinless decorations are those of cluster types 3 - 2 , 4 - 2 , 4 - 3 , 4 - 4 , and 4 - 5 in 1 , and of types 5 - 2 up to 5 - 11 in 2",
    "a `` spinned decoration '' ( also called a spin - bond decoration ) contains at least one spin .",
    "any spin in such a decoration must be attached to at least one 2 bond , but it can not be attached to a 1 bond ( otherwise , it would have been a skeleton - spin ) .",
    "examples of spinned decorations are those in cluster types 3 - 3 , and 4 - 6 up to 4 - 11 in 1 , and in cluster types from 5 - 12 up to 5 - 35 in 2 .",
    "although all 2 bonds of a mixed cluster are always parts of the decoration , there is no requirement that all 2 bonds of a mixed cluster must be between decoration - spins .",
    "some 2 bonds can be between skeleton - spins , as in cluster types 4 - 7 and 4 - 8 ( 1 ) .",
    "analogous definitions of spinless and spinned decorations apply to mixed clusters of the lopsided 1 - 3 model .",
    "their properties too are analogous to those of spinless and spinned decorations of the lopsided 1 - 2 model .",
    "the concept of a `` decoration '' will also be used in connection with pure-1 clusters .",
    "this usage may seem strange because all spins and all exchange bonds of a pure- 1 cluster are already included in its skeleton , i.e. , the skeleton is the entire cluster .",
    "one may therefore reasonably say that a pure-1 cluster has no decoration .",
    "the use of decorations in connection with pure-1 cluster types is just a matter of convenience .",
    "the `` existence '' of a decoration for a pure-1 cluster is merely a formality .",
    "a `` null decoration '' is defined as a decoration that contains no spins and no exchange bonds .",
    "all pure-1 clusters then have null decorations . obviously",
    ", having a null decoration is equivalent to having no decoration .    in summary",
    ", there are three categories of decorations : spinless ( pure - bond ) ) and spinned ( spin - bond ) decorations occur in mixed clusters .",
    "null decorations occur in pure-1 clusters .",
    "the size of a skeleton is the number of spins in the skeleton , labeled as @xmath61 .",
    "the size @xmath62 of a decoration is the number of spins in the decoration . for null decorations and spinless decorations , @xmath63 .",
    "the size @xmath64 of any cluster type @xmath65 composed of a skeleton and a decoration is @xmath66 the size @xmath67 of a fragment of a compound skeleton is the number of spins in the fragment .",
    "the size of the compound skeleton is the sum of @xmath67 over all fragments in the skeleton , @xmath68",
    "the concepts of skeletons and skeleton types bring insight into the physics of the fs in the high - field part of the spectrum .",
    "the major cause of this fs is illustrated by the following example .",
    "several cluster types of the 1 - 2 model have a simple skeleton of type @xmath58 .",
    "the lower part of 5 shows simulated spectra from all these cluster types .",

    "the high - field part of the spectrum starts at @xmath70 .",
    "the lower part of 5 shows that in this high - field part , spectral lines from all the cluster types with a @xmath58 simple skeleton are very close to @xmath71 .    the upper part of 5 shows the spectra from all cluster types with a compound skeleton containing a fragment of type @xmath58",
    ". all these cluster types also produce spectral lines very near to @xmath72 .",
    "several of these cluster types ( types 5 - 36 , 5 - 37 , and 5 - 38 ) also produce additional lines near @xmath73 .",
    "these three cluster types have a compound skeleton of type @xmath60-@xmath58 .    in the ( parent ) 1 model , the spectral lines of cluster type @xmath59 ( nn pair ) are exactly at @xmath71 . in",
    "the same model , cluster type @xmath29 ( nn triplet ) produces lines exactly at @xmath74 .",
    "the obvious interpretation of the high - field results in 5 is , therefore , that all cluster types of the 1 - 2 model that contain a simple skeleton or a fragment of type @xmath58 produce high - field lines at nearly the same magnetic fields as those of lines produced by cluster type @xmath59 in the 1 model .",
    "the additional high - field lines in the upper part of 5 , from cluster types 5 - 36 , 5 - 37 , and 5 - 38 , are due to the @xmath60 fragment in the @xmath60-@xmath58 compound skeleton .",

    "but then the 2 bond between the two decoration - spins will not be satisfied .",
    "thus , frustration of at least one of these three 2 bonds is inevitable . because of this frustration , the spin configuration in the zero - field ground - state of cluster type 5 - 27 is not immediately obvious .",

    "any such a `` 1 bridging path '' is relatively short , i.e. , the number of 1 bonds in the path is of order @xmath20 .",
    "an energy of order @xmath109 is required to produce an abrupt change of the relative orientations of spins in such a bridging path .    because the decoration is spinless , any weak bond ( 2 bond ) is between two skeleton - spins .",
    "these two skeleton - spins are also connected by one or more 1 bridging paths .",
    "( for examples see cluster types 4 - 2 up to 4 - 5 , and 5 - 2 up to 5 - 11 , in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "if a low - field mst occurs , it must arise from abrupt changes in the relative orientations of skeleton - spins that are coupled by 2 bonds .",
    "but such abrupt changes will always be accompanied by an abrupt energy change of order 1 from at least one 1 bridging path .",
    "an energy change of order 1 is incompatible with the assumption that the mst is in the low - field part of the spectrum .",
    "the preceding arguments for a spinless decoration may fail if the skeleton is compound rather than simple .",
    "the reason is that at least one 2 bond is between spins in different fragments .",
    "such spins are not connected by a 1 bridging path .    in the zero - field ground state of the cluster ,",
    "each fragment has a net spin , say , @xmath134 for one fragment and @xmath135 for the other .",
    "if neither of these fragment - spins is zero at @xmath111 then the 2 bond(s ) between the fragments will cause @xmath134 and @xmath135 to be antiparallel in zero field .",
    "in the low - field region ( @xmath14 of order @xmath20 ) , a series of mst s will then take place .",
    "this low - field series will end when @xmath134 and @xmath135 become parallel .",

    "the two @xmath60 fragments are coupled by only one 2 bond .",
    "the spinless decoration consists of the lone 2 bond linking the fragments .",
    "the spin arrangement in the zero - field ground state is represented by @xmath137 , where the dotted line is the 2 bond between the fragments .",
    "each fragment then has a spin @xmath138 .",
    "the antiferromagnetic 2 bond leads to a zero net spin for the entire cluster .",

    "cluster types @xmath65 of the 1 model that have sizes @xmath8 are not treated explicitly . however , these cluster types are not totally ignored .",
    "an allowance for 1-clusters larger than quintets is made by increasing the initial counts @xmath164 for all the quintet types @xmath65 of the 1 model by @xmath165 .",

    "are added in an earlier stage which is devoted to 3 skeletons and fragments .",
    "what complicates matters is that whenever a 3 fragment was added , a 2 fragment was automatically added at the same time .",
    "the reason is that a skeleton of a cquin with a 3 fragment is always of type 3 - 2 .",
    "the 2 fragments that were introduced before the beginning of the stage devoted to 2 skeletons / fragments must be included in the second count for this stage .",
    "the cquin s types that are added at any one stage include all the quintet types of the 1 - 2 model that have skeletons and fragments of type @xmath160 .",
    "the populations of these cquin s types are determined by two rules : 1 ) the total number of skeletons and fragments of type @xmath160 , in all the cquin s that are added at this stage , is equal to the difference @xmath167 between the initial and second counts for type @xmath65 .",
    "this requirement fulfills the first guideline in part [ a : ab ] of this appendix .",
    "2 ) the ratios between populations of different cquin s types that are added in any stage must be equal to the population ratios for real quintets of the same types .",

    "note that cquin s of types 5 - 36 up to 5 - 38 contain 2 fragments , in addition to 3 fragments .",
    "therefore , already at this stage some 2 fragments are added to the ensemble of cquin s .",
    "this stage involves the pairs ( cluster type @xmath59 ) of the 1 model .",

    "therefore , the cquin s that are added in the final stage have no skeletons ; they are pure 2 clusters .",
