    "the discoveries of ternary rare earth ( re ) chevrel phases remo@xmath0s@xmath1 and rerh@xmath2b@xmath2 @xcite compounds with regular distribution of localized magnetic moments of re atoms have proved conclusively the coexistence of various types of magnetism with superconductivity .",
    "intensive experimental and theoretical works have shown that 4f electrons of re atoms responsible for magnetism and 4d electrons of molybdenum chalcogenide or rhodium boride clusters responsible for superconductivity are spatially separated and therefore their interaction is weak . in many of these systems superconductivity coexists rather easily with antiferromagnetic order , where usually the neel temperature @xmath3 is lower than the critical temperature for superconductivity @xmath4 .",
    "on the other hand , ferromagnetism and superconductivity can not coexist in bulk samples with realistic parameters .",
    "quite often the ferromagnetic order is transformed into a spiral or domain - like structure,@xcite depending on the type and strength of magnetic anisotropy in the system.@xcite for almost two decades the problem of the interaction between magnetism and superconductivity has been overshadowed by high temperature superconductivity ( hts ) found in copper oxides .",
    "however , the recent discovery of the presence of magnetic order in ru - based superconductors @xcite has triggered a new series of experiments and inspired a return to the so - called coexistence phenomenon.@xcite most recently , the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity was studied in d - electron uge@xmath5@xcite and zrzn@xmath5@xcite , where itinerant ferromagnetism may coexist with superconductivity , and in heavy fermion upd@xmath5al@xmath6,@xcite where magnetic excitons are present in the superconducting phase . among classic magnetic superconductors ,",
    "the chevrel phases have been studied most intensively .",
    "these compounds are mainly polycrystalline materials .",
    "however , some specific features can be measured only on single crystals .",
    "one such effect is a two - step flux penetration process , predicted in ref .",
    "( ) and later observed solely in the antiferromagnetic superconductor ( bct ) errh@xmath2b@xmath2.@xcite this very interesting phenomenon was recently rediscovered in dymo@xmath0s@xmath1,@xcite although good quality single crystals of the classic antiferromagnetic superconductors have been a long time available and measured .",
    "the dymo@xmath0s@xmath1 compound with @xmath7 exhibits transition from the paramagnetic to the antiferromagnetic state at @xmath8 .",
    "its crystal structure can be described as interconnected mo@xmath0s@xmath1 units and dy ions .",
    "one such unit is a slightly deformed cube where s atoms sit at the corners and mo atoms are situated at the cube - faces .",
    "the mo@xmath0s@xmath1 units are arranged in a simple rhombohedral lattice and dy ions are located in the center of the unit cell .",
    "the magnetic moments of dy ions form a simple structure consisting of @xmath9 planes with moments of @xmath10 alternately parallel and antiparallel to the @xmath11 $ ] rhombohedral axis .",
    "neutron experiments performed on dymo@xmath0s@xmath1 in an applied magnetic field at @xmath12 have revealed in the intensity spectrum a number of peaks characteristic for ferromagnetic order.@xcite these peaks begin to develop at @xmath13 , much below the superconducting upper critical field @xmath14 .",
    "thus , in dymo@xmath0s@xmath1 a kind of ferromagnetic order coexists with superconductivity in the same manner as antiferromagnetism . for a field",
    "applied parallel to the @xmath11 $ ] direction ( magnetic easy - axis direction ) , the ferromagnetic order is a spin - flop type.@xcite    this feature is easy to understand . consider the well known phase diagram of a two - sublattice antiferromagnet .",
    "an infinitesimal magnetic field applied perpendicular to the easy axis makes the ground antiferromagnetic configuration unstable against the phase transformation to the canted phase . on the contrary , if the magnetic field is applied parallel to the easy axis the antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase is stable up to the thermodynamic critical field @xmath15 as is seen on fig.[fig1 ] ( left panel ) .        when the field is further increased , a spin - flop ( sf ) phase develops in the system .",
    "let us assume that in the antiferromagnetic superconductor the lower critical field fulfills the relation @xmath16 and that the external field @xmath17 is applied parallel to the easy axis .",
    "when @xmath18 the abrikosov vortices appear entirely in the af phase .",
    "when @xmath17 is increased beyond @xmath19 the phase transition to the sf phase originates in the core , because near @xmath20 the field intensity in the core is approximately twice @xmath20.@xcite the spatial distribution of the field across the vortex is a function decreasing from the center as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( right panel ) .",
    "thus , the magnetic field intensity outside the core is less then @xmath15 and , therefore , the rest of the vortex remains in the af phase .",
    "the radius of a spin - flop domain grows as the field is increased .",
    "the formation of domains inside the vortices should be accompanied by the modification of the surface energy barrier.@xcite    s@xmath21 single crystal in the virgin state measured as a function of an applied field for three temperatures below @xmath22 .",
    "the field direction is oriented parallel to the magnetic easy axis of the crystal .",
    "each @xmath23 curve exhibits characteristic plateau indicating that a number of vortices is kept constant when the external field is increased .",
    "the calculated values of the second critical field for flux penetration @xmath24 are in very good agreement with the measured ones.@xcite , height=225 ]    this process leads to a state of the superconductor in which flux entrance is temporarily prohibited , flux density in the sample is constant as the applied field increases ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . in order to kill this state the external field should be increased above certain second critical field for flux penetration @xmath24 .",
    "then , the vortices penetrating the sample will have the spin flop domains created along the cores .",
    "the above considerations apply to the classical superconducting chevrel phases as well as to the high @xmath4 superconductors .",
    "the present work is inspired by the above described discovery and the hope that the same behavior could possibly be observed in some of the layered superconducting structures .",
    "indeed , the situation seems to be very similar in layered hts .",
    "here magnetic order is produced by the regular lattice of re ions occupying isolating layers electrically isolated from the superconducting cu - o planes .",
    "therefore spin interaction between the local magnetic moments and the conduction electrons is to weak to inhibit superconductivity .",
    "the typical example of the layered system is erba@xmath25cu@xmath26o@xmath27 .",
    "this compound has tetragonal unit cell with small orthorhombic distortion in the a - b plane.@xcite the @xmath28 ions form two sublattice antiferromagnetic structure of magnetic moments lying parallel and antiparallel to the @xmath29 direction in the @xmath30 plane.@xcite recently discovered re nickel boride - carbides@xcite may serve as an another example of layered magnetic superconductors .",
    "the layered structure of re nickel boride - carbides is reminiscent of that of hts and consists of re - carbon layers separated by ni@xmath5b@xmath5 sheets .",
    "@xcite for example in erni@xmath25b@xmath25c the antiferromagnetic structure is associated with magnetic moments of er@xmath31 ions , which order below 6 k in a transversely polarized planar sinusoidal structure propagating along @xmath32 or @xmath29 axis with er moments parallel to the @xmath32 or @xmath29 axis respectively .",
    "in the following we consider the structure shown on fig .  [ fig3 ] that we believe simulates a real structure of many antiferromagnetic layered superconductors . a good candidate to show the above described phenomenon should possess the isolating layers with the magnetic moments of re ions running parallel and antiparallel to the direction ( easy axis ) lying in the @xmath30 plane .",

    "the neel temperature for layered antiferromagnetic superconductors varies from hundreds of mk ( 0.6k for erba@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath211 ) to several kelvin ( 6.8k for erni@xmath5b@xmath5c ) and therefore both mechanisms of activation are present in these compounds .",
    "the preexponential factors and @xmath209 can not be calculated in the framework of thermodynamic considerations alone .",
    "fortunately , it was shown in @xcite that the activation probability of macroscopic quantum excitations is proportional to @xmath212 .",
    "thus we can assume that @xmath213 .",
    "now we can calculate the current - voltage characteristics for the current density @xmath214 @xmath215 this almost linear dependence of @xmath216 on @xmath159 indicates that the resistive mechanism of bundle activation follows ohm law .",
    "we can also calculate the rate of flux creep due to the thermal activation of vortices . to do this",
    "consider hollow cylindrical sample of a radius @xmath217 and the wall thickness @xmath218 placed in the magnetic field @xmath219 applied parallel to the cylinder axis .",
    "the sample has the trapped field @xmath220 inside the hole and corresponding trapped flux @xmath221 .",
    "according to the faraday s law electric field due to the change of the trapped flux is equal to @xmath222 . combining this result with eq .",
    "( [ eq44 ] ) we have finally @xmath223 this equation can be solved analytically only in the case of the weak currents .",
    "consequently for excitations in the form of bundle of vortices the above equation is written as @xmath224 where @xmath225 and @xmath226 is the factor determined by the geometry of the sample .",
    "the solution of eq  ( [ eq47 ] ) is given in terms of exponential integrals and for the case of @xmath227it can be approximated as : @xmath228 where @xmath229 this result is in agreement with the experiments on hts.@xcite for @xmath230 the change of trapped flux is linear in time and for @xmath231 logarithmic . in antiferromagnetic superconductors , however , we see additional change of characteristic frequency as the magnetic field changes its direction in the @xmath30 plane .      below @xmath209 ,",
    "the quantum activation probability is essentially independent of temperature @xmath232 and is interpreted as arising from the quantum tunneling of vortices through intrinsic pinning potential.@xcite in the folowing we show a considerable change of tunneling rate and crossover temperature due to the sf phase transition around the vortex core .",
    "now , consider the vortex line as a straight string - like object of an effective mass @xmath233 per unit length trapped into a metastable state in an intrinsic pinning potential @xmath234 and exposed to continuous deformation @xmath235 in the @xmath236 direction.@xcite the magnetic field is applied in @xmath66 direction ( @xmath32 direction on fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . in the semi - classical approximation",
    "the quantum decay rate is calculated as a saddle - point solution ( bounce ) of the euclidean action @xmath198 for the string @xmath237 here @xmath238 , @xmath239 is the viscosity coefficient and @xmath240 denotes imaginary time .",
    "the pinning potential @xmath234 consists of intrinsic periodic part and the lorentz potential : @xmath241 for large current , this potential can be expanded around the inflection point to give @xmath242 , \\label{eq51}\\ ] ] where @xmath243  and  @xmath244  may be thought as the width of the barrier because @xmath245 .",
    "the last term in ( [ eq49 ] ) is the so - called caldeira - leggett action , @xcite which describes ohmic damping produced by the coupling to the heat - bath of harmonic oscillators .",
    "the line tension @xmath83 is different for vortices in two different orientations in the @xmath30 plane .",
    "as previously discussed the vortices lying parallel to @xmath29 direction and those laying in the @xmath32 direction but created in the magnetic field fulfilling relation @xmath246 @xcite have the line tension equal to @xmath247 for those vortices lying in the @xmath32 direction but possessing spin flop domain , we write the following expression@xcite @xmath248 in the semiclassical approximation the decay rate is given by the value of the action on a classical trajectory obtained from the euler - lagrange equations of the motion @xmath249 the trajectory @xmath250 for static solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq54 ] ) gives the activation energy in the thermal regime @xmath251 .",
    "below this crossover temperature a new kind of trajectory , periodic in imaginary time , develops .",
    "therefore , @xmath252 can be expanded in the fourier series with matsubara frequencies @xmath253 substituting this expansion into ( [ eq54 ] ) and linearizing potential around the static solution @xmath250 one obtains @xmath254 the above equation has three discrete solutions,@xcite the unstable one corresponding to the tunnelling process determines the crossover temperature @xmath255 ^{\\frac{1}{2}}-1\\right\\}\\label{eq57}\\ ] ] the above calculations apply to both kind of vortices . the only difference is their effective mass and viscosity coefficient .",
    "it is possible to express these parameters as the function of condensation energy accumulated in the vortex cores . for the stationary flux flow",
    "the viscous force @xmath256 is equal to lorentz force .",
    "the electric field generated by the moving vortex is @xmath257 , so we get @xmath258 where @xmath259 is the normal phase resistivity in the @xmath30 plane and @xmath260 is the upper critical field parallel to the layers . finally , @xmath261 where @xmath262 is calculated from the constitutive relation @xmath263 .",
    "the effective mass of the vortex can be deduced from the work of suhl.@xcite he derived the core contribution to the inertial mass @xmath264 , where @xmath265 denotes the mass of the electron and @xmath266 is the fermi energy , and the electromagnetic contribution coming from the energy of the electric field induced by the moving flux .",
    "simple estimation shows that this contribution in layered superconductors is @xmath267 of the core contribution .",
    "therefore , @xmath268 it is possible now to relate the crossover temperature in eq .",
    "( [ eq57 ] )  to the line tension of the vortex @xmath269 the coefficient @xmath102 depends on the material constants and current intensity .",
    "as was already mentioned there are two types of vortex lines in the system .",
    "the first ones , without magnetic domain , occur when the field is applied in the @xmath32 or @xmath29 direction , but its intensity does not exceed @xmath270 .",
    "( [ eq52 ] ) gives their line tension and the related crossover temperature @xmath271 .",
    "the other type , possessing magnetic domain , occur when the field is applied in the @xmath32 direction and its intensity exceeds @xmath270 .",
    "( [ eq53 ] ) gives their line tension and the crossover temperature as @xmath272 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath273 and therefore @xmath274 .",
    "the above calculations lead to the following conclusion .",
    "it is possible to switch the creep regime at constant temperature . to do this",
    ", one needs to change the field intensity or simply change the field direction in the @xmath30 plane .        the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] show possible scenarios of crossover from quantum to thermal regimes .",
    "let us discuss just two of them .",
    "the first prescription is following .",
    "fix the temperature @xmath209 somewhere in the range @xmath275 . then align the external field in the @xmath32 direction and increase its intensity to the point marked `` 1 '' on the left diagram in fig .",
    "the system is in the quantum creep regime now .",
    "then increase the external field beyond @xmath270 .",
    "the system jumps to the point `` 2 '' of the left diagram and finds itself in the thermal creep regime .",
    "doing the same operations in the reverse order one enforces the system to crossover from thermal to quantum creep regime .",
    "the other scenario is the following .",
    "apply magnetic field along @xmath32 axis and increase its intensity above @xmath270 keeping temperature constant in the interval @xmath276 . then move the direction of the external field from @xmath32 to @xmath29 axis .",
    "the system goes now from point `` 2 '' of the left diagram ( thermal creep ) to the point `` 3 '' of the right diagram ( quantum creep ) .",
